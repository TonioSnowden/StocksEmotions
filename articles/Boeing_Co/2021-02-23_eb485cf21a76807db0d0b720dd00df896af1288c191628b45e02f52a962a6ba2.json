  "title": "Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza owner IHG warns of tough 2021",
  "text": "<p>Cost savings and cash management helped InterContinental Hotels deliver a better than expected set of results for 2020, but management warned the immediate future looks bleak. </p> <p>“2020 was clearly the most challenging year in our history, with Covid-19 heavily impacting demand across our industry. 2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place, with more meaningful progress towards recovery for the industry unlikely until later in the year,” chief executive Keith Barr said.</p> <p>The Holiday Inn owner reported a 52 per cent drop in revenue to $992m, which was slightly ahead of the $989m consensus forecast. Operating profit of $219m was down 75 per cent year-on-year but not as bad as the $191m analysts had expected. The hotelier reported net debt at the year end of $2.5bn.</p> <p>Revenue per available room, the hotel industry's preferred trading measure, plunged 52.5 per cent across the group as resilient demand in China failed to offset a slump across Europe and America. Extended stay brands such as Candlewood Suites were the best performers across the portfolio. </p> <p>Management cancelled its 2020 final dividend, having stopped payouts last March in response to the crisis. “The board will consider future dividends once visibility of the pace and scale of market recovery has improved,” it said.</p> <p>IHG shares have rallied 92 per cent from their March lows on optimism around the reopening of international travel and are just 12 per cent below a record high set in mid-2019. But ahead of the results, broker Peel Hunt downgraded the stock to “reduce”, saying the rebound's strength had “checked out of reality”.</p> <h2>Briefly </h2> <p><strong>HSBC</strong> said it would resume paying a dividend and invest more heavily in Asia after announcing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb321081-434e-43f4-b9e7-13354afdfc5f\">a 34 per cent drop in annual profits</a>. Europe's largest bank posted a profit before tax for 2020 of $8.8bn, down from $13.4bn the previous year but slightly above analysts' expectations. Having made “a good start to 2021”, HSBC plans to invest about $6bn in fast-growing markets including mainland China and Singapore.</p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> has approved the sale of its French division to Aéma Groupe for €3.2bn&#xa0;in cash. The insurer, which had confirmed last month it was exploring strategic options across its portfolio, said the disposal will significantly strengthen its capital and liquidity. It expects to complete the sale by the end of 2021.</p> <p><strong>Standard&#xa0;Life&#xa0;Aberdeen</strong> has confirmed it is selling its flagship&#xa0;Standard&#xa0;Life&#xa0;brand to insurer Phoenix for an undisclosed amount. The companies set out an extension and simplification of their long-term partnership as part of the agreement, which will see <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abd0121f-1c6a-4126-9dea-a1d5253aab09\">SLA</a> provide fund management services to Phoenix until at least 2031.</p> <p>Mike Ashley's <strong>Frasers Group</strong> has warned it will book an additional charge in excess of £100m to cover Covid-19 damage to its store portfolio. The Sports Direct owner said the non-cash impairment charge would capture “this&#xa0;current lockdown, potential systemic changes to consumer behaviour, and the risk of further restrictions in future”. Freeholds, equipment and rental values would be reduced ahead of lockdown restrictions being lifted in England on April 12, the company said.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile</h2> <p><strong>Facebook</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/360b0419-83b4-4bcb-b7a3-495be92723fc\">agreed to restore Australian news</a> on its platform following an agreement with the government on amendments to a draft law that would force Big Tech to pay for news. Canberra said the amendments to the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fed6b2a-01ba-4c7e-8e95-d50f74c316bf\">proposed law</a>&#xa0;would provide clarity for digital platforms and news media businesses about how its code would operate; the agreement follows a&#xa0;public backlash in Australia&#xa0;after Facebook last week blocked the sharing of all news on its platform in the country.&#xa0;</p> <p>Adam Neumann could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac124bf5-9f0c-4498-b801-344cd8f96ef5\">reap almost $500m in cash</a> from his holdings in <strong>WeWork</strong> and emerge with a stake in a public company, less than 18 months after the high-profile failure of its initial public offering cost him his job as chief executive.&#xa0; SoftBank is in advanced talks with WeWork's co-founder and other shareholders to settle a bitter legal battle stemming from the Japanese group's 2019 rescue of the office group, which was needed to help it avert bankruptcy in the wake of the IPO's collapse, people familiar with the negotiations said.&#xa0;<br><br>Federal investigators said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab798d0c-ed7f-4df7-9689-d7405e7ee365\">“metal fatigue”</a> was likely to blame for causing the engine of a <strong>Boeing</strong> 777 jet to break apart at the weekend, raining metal on suburban Denver. The incident, which occurred four minutes after take-off, forced the United Airlines flight bound for Hawaii to turn around and make an emergency landing back at the Colorado state capital's airport. No one was injured. Dozens of Boeing 777 widebody aircraft with the engines have been grounded across the world; Boeing recommended airlines stop flying the jets until aviation regulators lay out “the appropriate inspection protocol”.</p> <p>Brazil's largest company <strong>Petrobras</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f0825c5-b6f1-4f2e-8305-f557364a3257\">plunged into turmoil</a> after the oil group's chief executive was ousted by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. It is probable he will be replaced in the coming weeks with a 71-year-old reserve army general who has no experience in the sector. The shock sent Petrobras's shares down more than 20 per cent on Monday, wiping billions of dollars from its market capitalisation, as investors grappled with the prospect of an inexperienced new chief and a Brazilian government once again using the oil group to serve its political and economic interests.<br><br>Telecoms group <strong>Liberty Global</strong> expects to have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3893643-15ef-48b6-b3b1-3082b23d1a16\">struck deals in Ireland and Poland</a> by the end of the year as the cable giant continues to drive consolidation in Europe. Chief executive Mike Fries said that pursuing deals with mobile operators in Ireland and Poland was “high on our list” of the group's priorities; in the UK, Liberty is preparing to merge its Virgin Media business with Telefónica's O2 following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac9a6a1a-02e4-4236-ab74-6bd033ea3104\">£31bn agreement</a> struck last year. </p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Sarah O'Connor <br></strong>When your business model turns out to be against the law, do you change the business model, or change the law? Gig economy companies such as Uber, battered by repeated legal defeats, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/430683ee-8016-42a0-9f78-acbcc83e992a\">want to do the latter</a>. If they succeed, then a handful of mostly lossmaking companies will change the world of work profoundly.</p> <p><strong>Big Read</strong> <br>Is McKinsey <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0\">losing its mystique?</a> The consultancy will pay $574m to settle 49 US states' claims that its advice to pharmaceutical companies contributed to the deadly opioid crisis — a reckoning without precedent in an industry that typically takes no blame for how its advice is used.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
