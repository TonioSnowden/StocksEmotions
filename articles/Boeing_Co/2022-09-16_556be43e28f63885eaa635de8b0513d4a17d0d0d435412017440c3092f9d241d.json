  "title": "The Aviation Crisis Is Now Regional; Even as airlines start to emerge from the pandemic, staff shortages and capacity cuts have plunged regional aviation back into a crisis",
  "text": "<p>\"Regional\" aircraft have between roughly 40 and 150 seats and include turboprops like the de Havilland Canada DHC-8, the ERJ and E-Jet small-jet families made by Brazil's Embraer and, arguably, even Airbus' A220. Early in the pandemic, many analysts believed that, though less economical per passenger, these planes would lead the recovery in a world in which seats were harder to fill and people stayed closer to home.</p><p>They were wrong. The number of scheduled seats did initially rise as much for regional jets as for mainline narrow-body aircraft, U.S. data by Oliver Wyman PlaneStats shows. But, since last summer, they have nosedived: Capacity is now roughly 20% below February 2020 levels. Turboprops have done far worse.</p><p>Shares in Embraer, as well as the two listed U.S. regional operators, SkyWest Airlines and Mesa Air Group, have fallen 45%, 53% and 61% this year, respectively. While a small market for the aerospace industry, regional aircraft are a profit spinner for manufacturers with exposure to the repair business, like Meggitt, because they tend to be older and less prone to being retired. Yet data firm Ishka estimates that these planes' values have plummeted, with a DHC-8 now worth half as much as it was in January 2020â€”a loss matching that of Boeing 777-300ER transoceanic jets.</p><p>What has happened? For one, many regional aircraft are operated by small firms under fixed-price agreements with mainline airlines, and the latter have spent a decade cutting feeder traffic to consolidate into fewer hub airports. Covid-19 has given them an excuse to further slash services to small airports. In 2020, for example, United Airlines ended its partnership with ExpressJet Airlines, which tried to reinvent itself as a charter carrier before filing for bankruptcy last month.</p><p>Contractors do have the luxury of not paying for fuel under the terms of their contracts with big carriers. But high fuel prices also increase the latter's incentive to reduce regional capacity.</p><p>The key factor, however, is the shortage of pilots, particularly captains. To plug holes in their staffing, big airlines have gone on an aggressive campaign to poach staff from smaller operators, leaving hundreds of regional planes grounded.</p><p>To be sure, the only way may be up. James Moon, chief executive of leasing company AerMoon, says that the battle to scoop up regional planes in the used market, including turboprops, has recently heated up. To increase its retention and hiring power, American Airlines has massively upped the pay at the three regional carriers it owns. Mesa and CommutAir, which operates flights for United Airlines, followed its lead last month. Still, \"it will take some time before the issue is resolved,\" American's Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr told employees a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>Ultimately, a higher-cost regional aviation market may advantage upstarts like David Neeleman's Breeze Airways, which focuses on underserved airports using the larger E-Jet and A220 regional jets. For most players focused on aircraft under 70 seats, even the shortest flights will be a slog.</p><p>Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com</p><p>The Aviation Crisis Is Now Regional</p>",
