  "title": "Stocks Move Lower After Powell's Talk --- Oil prices advance, as U.S. crude tops $112 a barrel; Occidental Petroleum, Hess gain",
  "text": "<p>The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index lost 55.38 points, or 0.4%, to 13838.46, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 201.94 points, or 0.6%, to 34552.99. Major U.S. stock indexes on Friday finished their best week since November 2020.</p><p>Boeing shares fell $6.93, or 3.6%, to $185.90 after a Boeing 737 passenger plane operated by China Eastern Airlines carrying more than 130 people crashed in southern China.</p><p>Mr. Powell, speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, said the U.S. central bank was prepared to raise interest rates in half-percentage-point steps -- and high enough to deliberately slow the economy -- if needed.</p><p>\"Investors are taking Powell's transparency as a step further to say 'He's just preparing us for the worst,'\" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. \"Whereas, the bond market is saying, 'No, no, he's telling you he's going to do at least seven [rate increases], and you aren't listening.'\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.315%. Yields and prices move inversely. Analysts say higher yields could sap investor appetite for riskier assets.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say bonds look like a phenomenal investment at this point in time, but they are definitely more balanced than they were earlier into the year,\" said Matt Dmytryszyn, chief investment officer at Telemus.</p><p>The Ukraine war has heightened volatility in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies as investors try to assess the economic impact of sanctions and the potential for disruptions to supply chains. Investors are monitoring developments out of the region and whether a resolution can be soon found.</p><p>\"This is the main driver of markets in the coming days and maybe even weeks -- it is about everything that comes out of the Ukraine conflict,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research.</p><p>Shares of Nielsen Holdings dropped $1.68, or 6.9%, to $22.76 after the TV ratings company rejected a roughly $9 billion takeover offer from a private-equity consortium, saying that the offer undervalued the company. Shares of insurer Alleghany Corp. soared $167.85, or 25%, to $844.60 after Berkshire Hathaway said it agreed to buy the company for about $11.6 billion.</p><p>Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, added $7.69 a barrel, or 7.1%, to $115.62. West Texas Intermediate futures, their U.S. counterpart, rose $7.42, or 7.1%, to $112.12.</p><p>Most of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors fell. One of the few exceptions was energy, which rose 3.8%. Occidental Petroleum rose $4.72, or 8.4%, to $60.96. Hess added $6.44, or 6.1%, to $103.85, and Exxon Mobil gained $3.53, or 4.5%, to $82.20.</p><p>Elevated oil prices have prompted concerns of sustained high inflation and lower economic growth in the U.S. and Europe, as gas and energy prices eat away at household spending on other goods and services.</p><p>Support for a European Union-wide ban on the purchase of Russian oil is growing inside the bloc, according to diplomats involved in the discussions, which could send prices even higher. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn focus on Europe's reliance on Russian energy, with Germany getting over half of its gas from Russia.</p><p>\"We have this growing awareness that a couple of supply chains could be broken for good,\" Mr. Brzeski said. \"Energy prices, no matter how the war resolves, will remain high.\"</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose less than 0.1%. Russia's stock market remains closed, but trading of Russia's local-currency government bonds resumed Monday. Russia's central bank said it would purchase government bonds.</p><p>The Egyptian pound fell more than 13% against the dollar after Egypt's central bank raised its key interest rate at a meeting of policy makers that was brought forward by three days, citing the pickup in inflation pressures it sees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>As with many countries in Africa, Egypt has relied heavily on Ukraine and Russia for its imports of wheat.</p><p>According to the United Nations, more than 80% of its wheat imports came from the warring countries between 2018 and 2020.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei's 225 was up 1.55%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.1% and Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 was up 1.3%. S&amp;P 500 stock futures were down 0.2%, DJIA futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.3%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
