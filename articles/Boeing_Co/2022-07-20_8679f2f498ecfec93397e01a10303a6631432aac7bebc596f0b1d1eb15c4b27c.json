  "text": "<p><br>The US company buying Meggitt, the UK aerospace and defence group, has promised to increase the operation's research and development spending in Britain by at least 40 per cent, as part of a £6.3bn deal approved by the UK government.</p> <p>The agreement between Parker Hannifin and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy means the deal will not be referred for a full Competition and Markets Authority investigation.</p> <p>Meggitt's shareholders approved the 800p per share sale to Parker, based in Cleveland, last September. But BEIS had been considering whether to investigate the deal on national security grounds.</p> <p>As well as the pledge on R&amp;D spending, Parker agreed to increase by 20 per cent the number of apprenticeship opportunities the company offered. It also agreed to maintain Meggitt's headquarters in Coventry, keep levels of manufacturing employment and retain the company's “key areas of existing operational capability” in the UK.</p> <p>Parker said it would cut the company's net carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2025 and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Meggitt is a significant supplier to both civil and military aerospace manufacturers, including Boeing, Airbus and BAE Systems.</p> <p>Tom Williams, Parker's chair and chief executive, said the company was pleased to have reached this “important clearance milestone”.</p> <p>“We have also agreed to substantial legally binding commitments, which underscore our deep commitment to the&#xa0;UK,” Williams said. “As we move closer to the completion of the acquisition and the combination of these two strong businesses, we look forward to welcoming the Meggitt team to Parker.”</p> <p>Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary, formally accepted Parker's undertakings on Tuesday, clearing the way for the takeover to go ahead. Kwarteng took the initial decision to examine the deal last year amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d12a05df-7ef5-4fb1-b09b-81d49ac698fd\">rising concern</a> about takeovers of UK companies by foreign rivals. He took advice from defence secretary Ben Wallace as part of the process because of Meggitt's importance to suppliers to the UK's armed forces.</p> <p>Parker's approach last August started a brief contest for control of Meggitt, prompting TransDigm, a US aircraft parts maker, to make an approach and offer 900p a share before dropping its bid.</p> <p>Parker has said the new, combined group will be a “world-class provider of engineered aerospace solutions”. It said it expected the transaction to complete in the third quarter this year.</p> <p>Meggitt's shares were up 3.2p — 0.41 per cent — to 792.2p in mid-morning in London.</p><p>Source: Robert Wright in London 2022 'Meggitt's US suitor agrees deal with UK ministers to let £6.3bn takeover proceed' FT.com 20 July.
