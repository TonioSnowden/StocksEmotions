  "title": "Stocks Finish Higher After Omicron-Driven Selloff; Dow industrials post largest one-day point gain since early November",
  "text": "<p>\"You have a demand disruption story on one hand—Omicron—and a monetary tightening issue with the Fed, so people are trying to figure out which way is up,\" said Austin Graff, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager of the TrueShares Low Volatility Equity Income ETF, who is bullish on energy and financials companies.</p><p>The Dow industrials added 617.75 points, or 1.82%, to 34639.79, the largest one-day point gain since early November. The S&amp;P 500 rose 64.06 points, or 1.42%, to 4577.10, with all 11 of its sectors rising. The Nasdaq Composite gained 127.27 points, or 0.83%, to 15381.32.</p><p>Markets have bounced around this week in reaction to pandemic headlines. On Thursday, traders focused on comments from the World Health Organization's chief scientist suggesting vaccines were likely to still offer some protection. Stocks lost ground Wednesday, when the first Omicron case was identified in the U.S. Some investors are waiting to adjust their portfolios until more information about the new variant is available.</p><p>Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week opened the door to an interest-rate rise in the first half of 2022, adding to market volatility.</p><p>Shares of Vir Biotechnology fell $1.03, or 2.2%, to $45.94. The biotech firm and partner GlaxoSmithKline said its Covid-19 antibody drug was effective against the Omicron variant in early laboratory studies. Meanwhile, President Biden tightened Covid-19 testing timelines for travelers entering the U.S. and extended a mask mandate on transportation.</p><p>\"People are still dealing with uncertainty about Omicron and how much of a threat it poses,\" said Salman Baig, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.447%, snapping a two-day losing streak. Markets are still reacting to comments from Mr. Powell, who suggested the central bank was prepared to accelerate tapering, said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. Surging inflation in recent days has pushed the Fed to combat rising costs.</p><p>Treasury yields are influenced by Fed rate-increase expectations. Rising treasury yields affect stock prices because they hurt companies by increasing borrowing costs and give investors' alternatives to stocks.</p><p>\"The big question right now is, 'Where do investors go to hide out from the storm of a potential Fed move higher,'\" said John Cunnison, chief investment officer at Baker Boyer.</p><p>Dollar General shares fell $6.98, or 3.1%, to $215.81 after the retailer said its profit fell in the third quarter and cut its full-year guidance for same-store sales. Grocery-store operator Kroger climbed $4.44, or 11%, to $44.65 after it raised its full-year guidance. Boeing climbed $14.19, or 7.5%, to $202.38 after China's aviation authority issued a directive on the 737 MAX, bringing the plane a step closer to returning to Chinese skies.</p><p>Grab Holdings shares turned red, falling $2.26, or about 21%, to $8.75 after opening higher on their first day of trading in New York.The Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant completed a record-breaking merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.</p><p>Airline stocks have swung between gains and losses this week. Alaska Air, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines added more than 6% Thursday.</p><p>Weekly jobless claims came in at 222,000, a rise from the previous week. That was lower than economists had expected, as employers held on to workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>Global oil benchmark Brent crude ended the day higher, gaining 80 cents per barrel, or 1.16%, to $69.67. OPEC and its allies said Thursday they will proceed with their planned production increases in January.</p><p>Bitcoin extended losses into a third consecutive day, trading at around $56,935.70, down 0.2% from its level at 5 p.m. Wednesday. Overseas, the Turkish lira fell 1.4% to trade at 13.5 lira to $1, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named a loyalist as the country's new finance minister.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.2%. Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma jumped 21% on reports that biotech firm CSL may acquire it.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index ticked down 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.7%, with SoftBank closing down over 5%. Shares of the technology-investment firm have fallen for five consecutive days due to declines in some of its portfolio companies, such as Alibaba, WeWork and DoorDash.</p><p>Write to Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com and Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Finish Higher After Omicron-Driven Selloff</p>",
