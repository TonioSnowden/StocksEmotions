A federal appeals court revived longtime McKinsey &amp; Co. critic Jay Alix's lawsuit alleging the consulting giant concealed disqualifying conflicts of interest to skew the market for bankruptcy advisory work. The ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York revived a racketeering lawsuit accusing McKinsey of submitting false and misleading statements in 13 bankruptcy cases to hide financial conflicts.

Objecting creditors said in court papers Tuesday they weren't offered the same opportunity to subscribe to a planned sale of Aeroméxico equity as others with equal standing under bankruptcy law.</p><p>Owner of bankrupt 737 MAX supplier Tect challenges Boeing's liability release. The owner of bankrupt Tect Aerospace Group Holdings Inc. said it plans to vote against the 737 MAX supplier's chapter 11 liquidation plan if Boeing Co. would receive broad legal protection against liability stemming from the suspension of the jetliner's production.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Bankruptcy judge reconstitutes J&amp;J talc cancer committee. A New Jersey bankruptcy judge agreed Wednesday to consolidate two committees representing consumers who allege Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum-based products caused their cancer.</p><p>Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J. granted a bankrupt J&amp;J subsidiary's request to reconstitute the original claimants' committee formed when it first filed chapter 11 last year in Charlotte, N.C.</p><p>After the bankruptcy case was shipped to North Carolina, the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog formed two separate committees, one representing consumers with ovarian cancer and the other representing those with mesothelioma.

The United Arab Emirates and Turkey agreed to a currency swap equivalent to nearly $5 billion that reinforces an economic partnership between two Middle Eastern rivals and provides Ankara with a badly needed infusion of foreign funds. The injection of Emirati funds will help Turkey's central bank as it burns through foreign currency reserves to prop up the lira, which lost 40% of its value against the dollar last year. The amount exchanged is modest compared with Turkey's financial needs, however.</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Lenders to American Physician Partners have given the emergency medical staffing company more time to repay its overdue loans following the collapse of a refinancing deal last month, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
