  "text": "<p>The UK's aviation regulator has given the green light to send the first satellite into space from British soil, paving the way for a specially adapted jumbo jet carrying the payload to take off from an airport in Cornwall next year.</p> <p>The aircraft, operated by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit, is expected to depart Newquay airport, rebranded as Spaceport Cornwall, in January after its first operational flight was postponed from earlier this month because of delays in meeting licence terms.</p> <p>If the flight goes ahead it would also be the first satellite to be launched into orbit from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06b31043-0a12-42f4-9b7f-54e1d1a19211\">anywhere in western Europe</a>. Other European spaceports, such as Andøya in Norway, are also racing to claim the title as a number of governments compete for a share of the rapidly growing launch market. </p> <p>Space analysts Euroconsult estimate that 18,500 satellites weighing less than 500kg will be launched into low earth orbit over the next decade.</p> <p>“Today we are one step closer to opening the UK's galactic gateway, with Virgin Orbit receiving a historic first licence to allow the UK's first ever space flight launch,” said UK transport secretary Mark Harper in a statement.</p> <p>Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne rocket, which is carried under the wing of the specially modified Boeing 747, or jumbo jet, is one of the world's few horizontal launch systems. It will send industry and defence satellites into orbit on the converted aircraft, called Cosmic Girl. </p> <p>The former Virgin Atlantic airliner will take off from a runway on the outskirts of Newquay airport and climb to 35,000 feet before releasing the rocket over the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of the UK.</p> <p>A successful launch would be first for Virgin Orbit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/920ef95a-c142-4d22-ab2d-dd20fa075932\">outside</a> the US and a key test of its claim to be able to deliver payloads into space from anywhere with a suitable runway.</p> <p>The process of delivering a satellite into space from Cornwall has been more complicated than initially expected, and the company has had to scale back its launch ambitions for 2022. </p> <p>The protracted licensing process had led to some tensions between Virgin and the UK regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority. However, the delays merely illustrated the complexities of delivering the first satellite launch from a new site, said one person involved in the process. “Space is hard,” he said.</p> <p>The CAA said approvals were granted after Virgin Orbit demonstrated that it had “taken all reasonable steps to ensure safety risks arising from launch activities are as low as reasonably practicable”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Virgin met other security and environmental requirements, and also received a range control licence from the space regulator, which enables it to issue warning notices to keep people out of hazardous areas and monitor the rocket's progress.</p> <p>Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit chief executive, said the approvals “take us one step closer to the first satellite launch take-off from UK soil. This is a major milestone for the CAA and represents the successful completion of an enormous effort”.</p> <p>The spaceport at Newquay is one of seven under development in the UK — roughly as many as China — with some planning to offer the more traditional vertical launches.</p><p>Source: Mark Wembridge and Peggy Hollinger in London 2022 'UK aviation regulator approves first satellite launch from British soil' FT.com 21 December.
