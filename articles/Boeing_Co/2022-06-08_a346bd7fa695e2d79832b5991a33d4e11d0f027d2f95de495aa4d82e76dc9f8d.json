  "text": "<p>Melrose Industries was the star performer among FTSE blue-chips on Wednesday after unveiling plans to launch a £500mn share buyback.</p> <p>The investor payout, which had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce323950-3f4a-4c2e-9719-c09788976206\">delayed</a> in March because of the war in Ukraine, sent shares in the FTSE 100 company 9 per cent higher to 154.85p by late afternoon on Wednesday. </p> <p>It follows last week's sale of Ergotron, the ergonomic desk maker, that leaves the industrial turnround group focused on GKN, the engineer it controversially acquired for £8bn four years ago.</p> <p>The Ergotron disposal for £512mn to private equity's Sterling Group marks the final sale from Melrose's purchase of Nortek, an industrial conglomerate, in 2016.</p> <p>Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham said the company was now “in a position to again distribute capital to our shareholders and have chosen the quickest way to start to achieve that goal” following the Ergotron sale. </p> <p>The turnround group said in March following the outbreak of war in Ukraine that it was postponing the payout because of “the knock-on effects for the world markets that at this stage are uncertain and unquantifiable”. </p> <p>Analysts at housebroker JPMorgan Cazenove said the company would still have capacity for further returns to shareholders, even after the share buyback and assuming Melrose received the proceeds from the sale of Ergotron, which also makes stands for computer screens.</p> <p>Melrose has a “buy, improve, sell” business model. It has generated substantial returns for executives and shareholders through its focus on buying underperforming manufacturing businesses, restructuring them and selling them on. </p> <p>Also on Wednesday, Melrose presented a bullish outlook for its aerospace operations. The operations, which supply aircraft and engine parts to a range of customers including Airbus and Boeing, were hit by the wider downturn in the aviation industry during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <p>Melrose said its restructuring efforts were on track and that it expected an annual revenue growth rate of 7 per cent to 2030 for the aerospace business, with a faster rebound predicted by 2025. </p> <p>Peckham has previously said the group would consider a break-up of GKN, the aerospace, car parts and powder metallurgy business, when the time was right.</p> <p>It held out the prospect of a separate flotation of its automotive and aerospace businesses. </p> <p>Under the terms of the takeover, Melrose gave a government undertaking not to sell the aerospace business for five years. That pledge expires next year.</p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer 2022 'Melrose to launch £500mn share buyback after US disposal' FT.com 8 June.
