  "text": "<p>   Workers at three Boeing Co. defense manufacturing plants will vote Wednesday on a modified labor-contract proposal, temporarily avoiding a strike that was slated to start as soon as Monday. </p><p>   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said the aerospace company made a new contract offer after an overnight bargaining session. About 2,500 members of the union's District 837 work at three St. Louis-area Boeing plants that make weapons and military aircraft including the F-15 combat jet, the T-7A trainer and the MQ-25 refueling drone. </p><p>   Boeing said it was hopeful workers will accept the new offer, which addressed issues employees had previously raised during negotiations. </p><p>   The contract dispute has largely focused on retirement benefits for the St. Louis-area workers. </p><p>   The company's proposed three-year contract offers new workers an $8,000 lump-sum payment and scraps earlier plans to cut company contributions to employees' 401(k) savings plans. </p><p>   A strike could start on Thursday if employees reject the proposal. </p><p></p>",
