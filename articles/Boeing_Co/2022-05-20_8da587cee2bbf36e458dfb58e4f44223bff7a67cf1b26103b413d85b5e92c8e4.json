  "title": "Business News:  Starliner Heads  For Space Station  ----  By Micah Maidenberg",
  "text": "<p>   A Boeing Co. spacecraft blasted into orbit Thursday evening and began racing toward the International Space Station, despite facing an issue with two of the thrusters the vehicle uses. </p><p>   After months of delays, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft launched toward orbit shortly before 7 p.m. Eastern time Thursday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida without crew members on board, according to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration livestream. </p><p>   The vehicle is expected to fly to the space station and dock there Friday, before it returns to Earth several days later. </p><p>   An Atlas 5 rocket operated by United Launch Alliance, a company owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp., used its powerful boosters to launch the Starliner. </p><p>   The spacecraft later separated from another part of the rocket after takeoff and began pushing toward the space station, according to the NASA livestream. Starliner was reported to be in a stable orbit and traveling to the facility about half an hour after liftoff. </p><p>   Boeing and NASA officials said later Thursday that two of the thrusters used to maneuver the Starliner in orbit failed to work. After those failures, a third thruster activated and allowed the vehicle to complete a key maneuver, according to Mark Nappi, a Boeing vice president focused on the Starliner program. \"The system is designed to be redundant,\" he said, adding that teams are now investigating why the two thrusters didn't function. </p><p>   Steve Stich, a NASA program manager, said the mission was in good shape to be completed. </p><p>   The capsule is set to carry food and other cargo to the space station in a trip that should take about a day and transport other items back to Earth. </p><p>   The Starliner, which can carry seven people, so far hasn't been able to complete a test mission to the orbiting facility. A software error prevented Boeing and NASA from completing the first demonstration flight in 2019, and officials scrapped a makeup mission last summer after problems with valves on the vehicle. </p><p>   The challenges have delayed NASA's plan to be able to call on two different U.S. companies to handle human flights to the space station, where astronauts conduct scientific research. In 2014, the agency hired Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft it could tap for such trips, but only Elon Musk's SpaceX has proved its vehicle capable of making it to and from the facility. </p><p>   \"You want a second one not only for reasons of safety and accessibility -- you want it so that you have a constant supply of astronauts at the station to do all of the scientific research,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. </p><p>   Earlier this year, NASA awarded three additional flights to Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for SpaceX. Last month, the company launched another crew to the station using a Crew Dragon vehicle on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, marking its fifth NASA crew mission since 2020. SpaceX has also used that combination for private astronaut operations. </p><p>   Completing the latest mission would help pave the way for Boeing to use the vehicle for NASA crew flights -- and give the company a win as it contends with challenges with many of its aircraft programs, including the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets. </p><p>   In addition to the Starliner work, Boeing has been developing rockets as part of NASA's latest moon program and handling other projects for the space agency. </p><p>   The company has a long history of working with NASA, including on moon-landing Apollo missions decades ago. </p><p>   David Calhoun, Boeing's chief executive, has said space is an important part of the company's business, touting work for military clients and other customers. </p><p></p>",
