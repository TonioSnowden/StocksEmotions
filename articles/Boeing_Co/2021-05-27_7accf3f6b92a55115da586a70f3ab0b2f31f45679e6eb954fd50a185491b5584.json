  "text": "<p>Airbus has signalled confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic, setting out plans for a steep ramp-up in the production of the world's most popular single-aisle passenger jets. </p> <p>The European aerospace group told suppliers to prepare to raise production rates of its A320 family of aircraft beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, sending shares 6 per cent higher to €103 by late morning. </p> <p>“The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the Covid-19 crisis,” said Guillaume Faury, chief executive. </p> <p>Airbus said suppliers should be ready for an increase in production to 64 jets a month by the second quarter of 2023 of its A320 family of aircraft, best-known as workhorse planes typically used on short-haul journeys.</p> <p>This is higher than the rate of 60 the company was delivering pre-coronavirus. </p> <p>Airbus said in a statement that it was also exploring rates as high as 70 by early 2024 and 75 by 2025 after confirming plans of an increase to 45 jets a month in the fourth quarter of this year. </p> <p>The company expects monthly production of its wide-body A350 jet, its bigger aircraft used for long-haul, to rise from five per month to six by the autumn of 2022. </p> <p>The ambitious targets come against a backdrop of rising confidence in the longer-term recovery in international travel as the global rollout of vaccines gathers pace. </p> <p>The International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday that it expected <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2021-05-26-01/\">global passenger numbers to recover </a>to 52 per cent of pre-pandemic levels this year and for numbers to surpass those levels in two years once borders reopen. </p> <p>Industry executives have said the recovery will be led by the market in single-aisle jets, used for short-haul journeys, as domestic travel rebounds, notably in the US and China. </p> <p>This favours<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a10742a-56fb-4c98-9e45-0d6ffc9aab16\"> Airbus over its longstanding rival Boeing</a> because it has the lion's share of the single-aisle market. </p> <p>The US company, however, has made progress in recent weeks. It has started to clear the backlog that had built up of its 737 Max, the main single-aisle rival to the A320, since its grounding in the wake of two accidents. The Chicago-based group said last month it planned to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6b01d3e-e480-4706-ab33-34b69910058a\">increase production of the Max</a> to 31 per month by early 2022.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, described Airbus's production plans as “punchy”, noting that “getting the supply chain onside is clearly very important”. There were still risks to the plans, however, he added, citing airlines prioritising rebuilding their balance sheets and growing pressure to curb emissions. </p> <p>“We do not think these issues have gone away. Indeed, we continue to believe they will come more to the fore over time. We understand Airbus's production plans must reflect what its customers are saying, but a lot of water must yet pass under the bridge,” he said. </p> <p>Airbus and Boeing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21c7b4c3-6564-492d-9904-989219898cd5\">slashed production </a>of both single and twin-aisle aircraft by between a third and a half last year when the pandemic first hit amid a collapse in demand from cash-strapped airlines. </p> <p>One of the biggest challenges for the industry as it emerges from the downturn will be to ensure that its long, intricate supply chains are ready to increase production to meet the expected demand.</p> <p>Faury said the message to suppliers would provide “visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it”. </p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer 2021 'Airbus lifts jet production targets in bet on aviation rebound' FT.com 27 May.
