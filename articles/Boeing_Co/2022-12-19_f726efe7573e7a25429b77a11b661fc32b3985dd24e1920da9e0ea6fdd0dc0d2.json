Delta also highlighted robust demand for air travel as the industry recovers from the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic.</p><p>The carrier's stock has fallen 15.7% this year, compared with the S&amp;P 500's SPX decline of 20.1% and the U.S. Global Jets ETF's JETS fall of 18.4%.</p><p>At its investor day earlier this month, Southwest Airlines promised to return its route network to prepandemic levels by the end of 2023 and cited leisure- and business-travel booking trends that bode well for next year.
