  "title": "Now Arriving: 300 Airplane Geeks  At a Fast-Food Spot by LAX  ---  Aviation buffs have an overdue reunion  to watch the 747s and A380's go by  ----  By Alison Sider",
  "text": "<p>   LOS ANGELES -- The global coronavirus pandemic has made for a tough year and a half for the aviation-obsessed amateurs and industry insiders who geek out at airplane get-togethers and travel around the world. </p><p>   Air travel slowed to a near halt in the early months of the pandemic. Celebratory inaugurations of new routes and new planes were canceled. Even this year, many airline gatherings have been postponed, scaled down or held virtually. </p><p>   One is no longer grounded. </p><p>   On Saturday, aviation geeks flocked to a strip of trampled grass outside the In-N-Out Burger near Los Angeles International Airport. Some 300 showed up for this year's Cranky Dorkfest, according to Brett Snyder, the author of the Cranky Flier blog and the event's organizer. </p><p>   The fast-food joint is famous among plane spotters as one of the best places to watch aircraft zoom by overhead. On the ground, there isn't much to see along the strip of Sepulveda Boulevard that's home to airport parking, a 7-11 convenience store, a tattoo parlor and a smattering of other businesses. </p><p>   In the air, it's another matter. Planes from all around the world fly low as they make their final approach to LAX -- a diversity of aircraft that few other U.S. airports can match. </p><p>   \"This is one of my favorite places on Earth,\" Phil Derner, a California-based regional representative for the National Business Aviation Association, said of the strip of grass adjacent to In-N-Out. </p><p>   Mr. Snyder first put out the call for others to join him for a burger and some planespotting in 2011. He wasn't sure then whether anyone would show up, but attendance has surged over the years. </p><p>   \"It's so simple. It's big lumbering aircraft taking off and landing right above you,\" said Isaac Alexander, who works in accounting but started co-hosting weekly aviation discussions online to get his community fix during the pandemic. </p><p>   Airline and airport officials have caught wind, offering raffle prizes and perks like behind-the-scenes tours. Oscar Munoz, then-chief executive of United Airlines Holdings Inc., showed up in 2019. </p><p>   Saturday's gathering, the first since the pandemic, had the feel of a family reunion. Conversations were punctuated by roaring engines every two or three minutes as the enthusiasts craned their necks skyward. They tracked arrivals and eagerly awaited exotic models and the biggest jets. A CRJ-series regional jet? Meh. </p><p>   A Boeing 747 operated by Lufthansa with a retro paint job was a different matter. The Queen of the Skies, as aficionados refer to the jumbo jets, stopped most in their tracks. </p><p>   Drew Salgadoe, an airline employee and aviation podcaster, apologized for the interruptions: \"We're avgeeks. No matter what we're doing, we have to pause when a plane flies overhead.\" </p><p>   An Emirates Airbus A380 -- a hulking superjumbo jet that has become a rare sight -- capped off the afternoon. </p><p>   Plane enthusiasts and frequent fliers have found other outlets for their passion during the pandemic. Some took \"flights to nowhere\" offered by airlines in Asia and Australia, jumping at any chance to board a plane. Others snapped up airplane food, helping suppliers work down a glut of pre-packaged meals. </p><p>   Airline analyst Henry Harteveldt pours a weekly cocktail to toast his fellow aviation nuts, enjoying his libation in classic airline glassware that he inherited from his father or picked up at secondhand stores, and posting photos on Twitter. </p><p>   Before this, \"I didn't have much of a bar,\" Mr. Harteveldt said. Now the drinks are an event. He packed a glass featuring the 1980s-era logo for the now-defunct Western Airlines to drink an old-fashioned while en route to Dorkfest. </p><p>   Nick Benson was nervous that his service, JetTip, which \"tells airplane nerds when cool airplanes are coming to their airports,\" would fizzle. But appetite for spotting continued, he said: \"It's inherently interesting to a lot of people.\" </p><p>   Dotti Cahill, a nurse, said the pandemic interrupted trips to places like St. Maarten, where planes come in low over a beach. But she couldn't stay away from In-N-Out last year, even though Dorkfest was officially canceled. </p><p>   Avgeek partners and spouses don't always share the enthusiasm. Steve Tao, an entertainment executive with a penchant for accumulating frequent flier miles, said his husband couldn't be persuaded to attend Dorkfest. </p><p>   \"He's just not into planes as much as I am,\" Mr. Tao said. </p><p>   To make up for lost air time, Nate Moddison, who works in healthcare consulting, took a circuitous route from Dallas to L.A. for this year's event, flying to Charlotte, N.C., and then Newark, N.J., where he hopped on a United 787 to get a taste of the airline's transcontinental service. His journey home includes three flights. </p><p>   \"Why take two flights to LAX when I could do six?\" he said. </p><p>   For now, air travel is still hemmed in by border closures and complex new rules around testing, quarantine and vaccination. All the more reason to while away an afternoon staring at the jets overhead, said Scott Laird before Saturday's festivities. Though he works at a major U.S. airline and has no shortage of opportunities to see planes, watching one skip off the runway and into the sky is still awe-inspiring, he says. </p><p>   \"It really centers you when you're having a rough day,\" he said. \"This is what got all of us attracted to aviation -- it wasn't a spreadsheet, it wasn't financial results. It was that airplane flying overhead.\" </p><p></p>",
