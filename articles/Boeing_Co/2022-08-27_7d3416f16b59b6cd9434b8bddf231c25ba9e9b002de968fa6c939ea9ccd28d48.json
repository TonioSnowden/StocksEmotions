  "title": "U.S. News:  Launch Tests NASA's Moon Ambitions  ----  By Micah Maidenberg and Aylin Woodward",
  "text": "<p>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's planned launch Monday of a towering rocket and spacecraft is a test of the agency's effort to return to missions it pulled off decades ago: landing astronauts on the moon. </p><p>   The uncrewed launch would mark a milestone after years of work and setbacks by the space agency and aerospace contractors hired to develop vehicles and related hardware. It would also serve as a starting point for the Artemis program, NASA's renewed effort to put astronauts back on the moon for the first time since 1972. The agency has said it wants to send the first woman and person of color to the lunar surface in 2025 and establish a long-term presence there. </p><p>   Charles Duke Jr., a former NASA astronaut who spent more than 20 hours on the lunar surface during the 1972 Apollo 16 mission, said the coming launch represents a change for an agency that had become risk-averse. </p><p>   \"We're beginning to take some chances again, and to launch this thing all the way out to the moon on the very first mission instead of just doing it in Earth orbit is very, very ambitious,\" Mr. Duke said. </p><p>   Liftoff of Artemis I -- using the agency's Space Launch System rocket with the Orion spacecraft on top -- is set to begin as soon as 8:33 a.m. ET on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. </p><p>   Following billions of dollars in investment, cost overruns and delays, the stakes are high for the agency. Roger Launius, former chief historian at NASA, said a failure could threaten the agency's efforts to return astronauts to the moon. \"It's conceivable that some in the political world could say, 'Look, this is just too costly,'\" he said. </p><p>   NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has been touting the SLS rocket as the most powerful the agency has operated. </p><p>   In an interview, he compared Artemis I, which is expected to cost $4.1 billion in production and launch-operations expenses, with other agency missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope development and deployment. The $10 billion space telescope was nearly a decade late and billions over budget before NASA successfully had it launched in December. It recently completed a complicated monthslong deployment and has captured dazzling deep-space images and data. </p><p>   NASA is likely to spend about $93 billion over more than a dozen years on Artemis, according to a November report from the agency's inspector general, who has called the expected $4.1 billion price tag for each of the four anticipated Artemis missions unsustainable. Mr. Nelson said per-flight costs will come down as NASA spreads development expenses over more missions. </p><p>   The launch planned for Monday is expected to unfold over several stages. Weather or technical challenges could delay liftoff, and the agency has designated two dates in early September as backups. </p><p>   NASA plans to shoot the Orion spacecraft into orbit using its SLS rocket. That vehicle and the boosters connected to its sides are designed to fire for just a few minutes during the first stage of the mission before falling away. After deploying solar arrays and conducting several maneuvers, another propulsion system is meant to give Orion a major push toward the moon at around 90 minutes into the flight. </p><p>   A key test is slated upon re-entry, expected around six weeks after launch, when Orion's heat shield will have to withstand temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit as the spacecraft's crew capsule roars back into Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles an hour. Parachutes are designed to slow the capsule for a splashdown in the Pacific. </p><p>   Officials at NASA have said they plan to push Orion during the mission to get a read on how the vehicle operates before astronauts get on board. </p><p>   \"We are stressing Orion beyond what it was actually designed for,\" Robert Cabana, NASA's associate administrator, said Monday. </p><p>   NASA plans to use another SLS rocket to launch four astronauts aboard Orion's crew capsule in 2024 on a flight that would orbit the moon but not touch down. </p><p>   The following year, the agency plans a return to lunar orbit, where astronauts on board would transfer into a SpaceX lander that would transport two Americans down to the moon's surface. </p><p>   Some former NASA officials said Artemis I's ambitious scope poses its own risks. </p><p>   \"If this has a problem, are we going to put people on it next time?\" Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator for NASA and longtime critic of SLS and Orion, said of the mission set to begin Monday. </p><p>   Artemis's success depends not just on NASA, but also on a group of aerospace contractors overseen by the agency, as well as thousands of other suppliers across the country. </p><p>   Boeing Co. served as the main contractor for the core of the rocket -- the huge circular tank that will feed propellant to four Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. engines that NASA is reusing from its Space Shuttle program. Northrop Grumman Corp. built the missile-shaped boosters strapped to the rocket's sides, and Lockheed Martin Corp. serves as the prime developer of Orion. </p><p></p>",
