  "text": "<p>Airbus has signalled its confidence in the commercial aviation recovery by increasing this year's profit guidance — but chief executive Guillaume Faury warned a revival for larger aircraft may take several years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Faury told the Financial Times that after a strong first half the European plane maker now had “some certainty on the path” to recovery. “We have tried to keep some appropriate prudence,” he said, adding the “situation remains very dynamic”.</p> <p>Airline customers were making on-time payments for aircraft ordered before the pandemic, while demand for new jets is also returning, he said. “We see a lot of commercial discussions ongoing for some recent orders.”</p> <p>Separately, Faury attacked EU plans for a tax on aviation fuel, claiming it would slow the airline industry's attempts to decarbonise.</p> <p>Airbus shares rose 1 per cent to €116.68 by late afternoon on Thursday after jumping nearly 5 per cent earlier following its announcement of a doubling of its full-year profit guidance to €4bn. </p> <p>It also raised its guidance for cash flow and said it hoped to deliver 600 aircraft by the end of the year, up from a previous target of about 560.&#xa0;</p> <p>The group reported a 30 per cent increase in revenues to €24.6bn for the first half. Earnings before interest and tax for the first six months were €2.7bn.</p> <p>The bullish outlook came after US rival Boeing on Wednesday reported its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3969a61c-21cd-4a90-817f-f5ab725ecee1\">first quarterly profit </a>in two years, underlining growing optimism in the aviation industry as it emerges from one of its worst crises.</p> <p>In a further sign of its confidence, Airbus said it would launch a freighter version of its A350 passenger jet in a direct challenge to Boeing. The US company has traditionally dominated that segment of the market, which has boomed on the back of a rise in online shopping during the pandemic. </p> <p>“This is a sea change in Airbus's view of the market: they are effectively calling the end of the pandemic,” said Sash Tusa of Agency Partners.&#xa0;</p> <p>“But they have very, very good visibility on airlines that actually want their aeroplanes, so the pressure now is on the upside. In Europe, investors probably underestimate how incredibly strong the US airline market is.”</p> <p>Faury defended the company's recent announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0385167-ab76-488f-9051-1ca338a6fb40\">steep rise in the production</a> of its popular A320 family of single-aisle passenger jets that are used on short-haul journeys. </p> <p>The company said in May that suppliers should be ready for an increase in production to 64 jets a month by the second quarter of 2023.</p> <p>Faury said the company was confident the expansion to 64 was “feasible” while cautioning that a potential increase to 75 jets a month by 2025 was still being assessed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Airbus, he added, had asked suppliers to maintain the “physical hardware” such as rigs and tools needed to build aircraft during the pandemic with a view to ramping up production.&#xa0;</p> <p>He cautioned, however, that the short-term outlook for larger, widebody aircraft traditionally used on long-haul routes was still subdued. Airbus, he said, expected a “strong recovery in the wide-body market in terms of aeroplane deliveries” at some point but “this is probably in the second half of the decade”.</p> <p>Separately, Faury hit out at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5df5fb54-274b-4078-ba8e-1904d045edb5\">European proposals</a> to tax fossil-based jet fuel.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I completely disagree with it. In this particular case, it will not significantly change the demand, but it will significantly reduce the ability of airlines to do the right investments,” he told the FT.</p> <p>Faury's comments echo those of Willie Walsh, the head of Iata, the global airline industry trade body, who earlier this month accused the EU of an “own goal” after it published plans for a kerosene tax as part of a package of measures to halve the bloc's emissions by 2030.&#xa0;</p> <p>Despite reservations about the tax element of the EU plans, Faury said he was pleased to see that its “Fit for 55” package to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030 had “put the use of sustainable aviation fuels as a strong driver of carbon dioxide emission reductions”.</p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer 2021 'Airbus signals confidence in recovery as demand bounces back' FT.com 29 July.
