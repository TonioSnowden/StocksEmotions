  "title": "Business News: United Reduces Flight Schedule",
  "text": "<p>Still, robust holiday travel demand drove United's fourth-quarter revenue to $8.2 billion, down nearly 25% from 2019 but the highest quarterly total since before the pandemic began to decimate travel demand. United on Wednesday reported losses of $646 million for the fourth quarter and $1.96 billion for the year. The airline's adjusted fourth-quarter loss of $1.60 a share was lower than the $2.09 a share loss analysts had expected.</p><p>United said bookings for this spring and beyond remain strong and that its expansion plans have merely been delayed until later in the year. The airline still plans to increase flying in 2022 as it returns its Boeing 777 jets to service, after they had been sidelined for nearly a year as regulators reviewed proposed fixes for the aircraft's engine covers.</p><p>United said its reduced schedule will help drive its unit costs excluding fuel higher than it previously anticipated -- up 14% to 15% from the first quarter of 2019. Steeper costs for labor and fuel have concerned airline investors in recent months. United said it expects its jet-fuel prices to rise by about 10 cents a gallon in the first quarter from the end of 2021.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
