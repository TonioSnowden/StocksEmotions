  "text": "<p>The multibillion-pound business of buying and selling commercial aircraft was put on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic. But a rare public spat between Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and Boeing over the Irish airline's latest order of 737 Max 10 jets shows the high stakes game is sputtering back to life.</p> <p>It is also a sign that the aircraft market is reviving as airlines return to the negotiating table to place orders for passenger jets in anticipation of the return of more passengers.</p> <p>The pandemic has hit aviation hard, with Boeing saying the virus has cost the industry two years of growth. The breakdown of talks with O'Leary over a new batch of Max 10 jets shows a more confident approach from the US manufacturer, according to industry watchers. </p> <p>“It is good for the industry that Boeing is showing some price discipline. The Max is a good aircraft. They shouldn't be pressured by O'Leary into giving it away,” John Leahy, former commercial director at Airbus, told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Boeing has remained reticent about the disagreement with O'Leary, only noting that it valued Ryanair's business but had to exercise discipline. A large new order for the Max would have boosted the US group as it continues to build confidence in the aircraft after two fatal crashes.</p> <p>The company has won a series of orders this year, including for 150 of the Max 10 from United Airlines. It has also reduced the backlog of Max jets that had been built but did not have buyers to about a couple of dozen, according to market watchers.</p> <p>“Over the past year or so, Boeing has been going through the friends and family of the Max and offered a good price to help it clear the backlog of Maxes. All existing buyers bought some more,” said Rob Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners.</p> <p>Across the industry, although the recovery in traffic is patchy, airlines have returned to ordering new planes. </p> <p>Data from Ascend by Cirium, the aviation consultancy, show 902 new gross orders, which excludes cancellations and orders for non-commercial customers, recorded by Airbus and Boeing so far this year. This compares with 672 orders for the whole of 2020. North American airlines, notably United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, have led the charge this year. <br><br>“You can see the clear impact of Max orders from US majors [airlines],” said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium. </p> <p>Actual deliveries, however, are much lower. Over the same period, only 572 aircraft have been delivered. <br><br>Marc Allen, chief strategy officer at Boeing, said the company's sales teams were in discussions with a “number of customers globally”.<br><br>“We are seeing demand from a number of different regions. A lot of airlines recognise that now is an opportunity for them to reset their planning and their fleet intentions.”</p> <p>Dómhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, the Irish aircraft leasing company, said the recent orders from US airlines in particular over the past six months were a positive sign. “It sends a message of confidence in the market recovery and it also sends a message of confidence in the Max.”</p> <p>Airbus, the world's other leading jet manufacturer, in August recorded its best month for plane orders since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in January 2020.</p> <p>The European company, which has fallen behind Boeing in order flow this year as its US rival has replenished its Max backlog, reported 102 gross orders for August, including large deals with Delta Air Lines and Jet2, the British budget airline. The UK carrier's order for 36 A321neo jets was seen as a coup for Airbus because it has traditionally bought from Boeing.</p> <p>Airline bosses are clearly feeling more confident, too. Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, told an investor conference that crises also “create opportunities”.<br><br>“They've created us with a great opportunity to accelerate our fleet development, not just retire a lot of old inefficient planes, but acquire a lot of new. Not just the [Airbus] 321neos and the like, but going out into used markets, which we're not afraid of tapping into with some amazing bargains that will be around as a capital-friendly decision for years to come,” he said.<br><br>Robert Jordan, the incoming chief executive at Southwest Airlines, told the same conference that the airline expected 2022 to be a “big growth year in terms of net new aircraft” as it seeks to restore its network after the pandemic.<br><br>Even in Europe, where the recovery has been slower than in the US, carriers have begun to look at renewing their fleets, according to an industry executive, noting that confidence had been buoyed by a strong summer.</p> <p>O'Leary, well-known for his bullishness, is particularly upbeat despite the breakdown of talks with Boeing. He told investors on Thursday that the airline's new fleet of Boeing aircraft would help to deliver a step-change in growth. Ryanair expects to fly more passengers than previously forecast by March 2026.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, the air traffic revival remains tentative. Several of the largest US carriers last week revealed a slowdown in demand, blaming rising cases of the contagious Delta variant of coronavirus.</p> <p>Avolon's Slattery has also cautioned that on a global basis it will take “at least a couple more years to where I feel we are truly through the worst”.</p>&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer and Philip Georgiadis in London and Claire Bushey in Chicago 2021 'Aircraft sales show signs of life after pandemic slump' FT.com 19 September.
