  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>This week retail investors, for so long the underdogs of stock markets, mounted an audacious short squeeze on US hedge funds, for so long the masters of the universe. The operation, in which the r/WallStreetBets bulletin board featured as a rallying point, raised the value of the shares in struggling store chain GameStop eightfold at one point, according to Refinitiv data.</p> <p>Hedge fund Melvin Capital and Robinhood, the low-cost share trading service used by many WSB traders, both needed capital injections. </p> <p>Lex is sticking to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac7389f1-41d8-46b6-bc42-32ac603b7f91\">stance on the short squeeze</a>, despite furious pushback from WSB habitués. First, co-ordinated buying by any group of investors to drive up a security may be market abuse. It calls for close scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (a pin-sharp <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a483767-6b55-40a2-b8a6-1439a2f56084\">column </a>by the FT's Robert Armstrong sets out the issues). Second, professional investors quickly join in to make money from this new game. Here, gambits would include scraping sites such as WSB for algo trading tips and shorting the stock again at the top of its arc. Third, some retail investors will be left with big losses. </p> <p>We hold no brief for hedgies. They game the system in all kinds of ways too. They just have better legal advice and do not boast about what they are doing on a website anyone can read.</p> <p>The other point for us is that the GameStop raid feels distinctly top-of-the-market. Another sign of this is that brokers in Asia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e812d503-5df0-4820-b437-7b0d9b81ced3\">are getting cold feet</a> about their exposure to potential defaults by retail clients who have been buying stocks on margin.</p> <p>Free money will go on sloshing around for months to come. But some central banks are already hinting at a tightening of supply, notably the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b1e595e-bc3f-434f-96b1-cd205284d83e\">People's Bank of China</a>. </p> <p>Low-cost retail investment is here to stay. Its frothier manifestations — including raids on shorts, Spac mergers and a rush for stock in Asian initial public offerings — look like bull market phenomena.</p> <p>No wonder then that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccf5205b-deef-4c7e-b033-2c42741d1147\">Spac mergers</a> now feature electric vehicle companies, another investment craze. Electric bus maker Proterra and charging network EVgo Services have come to market via these listings. Investor enthusiasm will drive more electric vehicle groups to list in the same way soon. Since some have no revenues and many may fail, it looks like something of a lucky dip for investors. </p> <p>AMC was also caught up in the market madness. The cinema chain, whose stock featured in another raid on short-sellers, managed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2c0b21e-b2d7-4c6a-b4b7-3a855a588675\">raise almost $1bn</a> from a mix of equity and debt on Monday. That was enough cash to see it into this year and dispel any fears of imminent bankruptcy. Investors gambling on long-term survival are betting on a Hollywood ending in which creditors, patrons and film studios all play their parts to perfection.</p> <p>Short squeezes were not the only big news on Wall Street this week. Apollo chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7d733be-9c40-4331-9633-534e0f80b713\">Leon Black stepped down</a> after financial dealings with deceased New York sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public. Lex thought Mr Black's departure, along with measures including share voting reform, should help the private equity group's underperforming shares move into line with rivals Blackstone and KKR. If stakeholders are still unhappy, there is scope for further concessions.</p> <p>Elites in the US were not the only ones under pressure this week as political squabbles in Europe picked up. Burns Night on Monday seemed an opportune moment for Lex to assess fresh proposals for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b812c65c-cabb-47d2-bcde-3f34774d4f81\">Scotland's exit from the UK</a>, alarming though those are to the UK government. A lot has changed since Scotland voted to remain in 2014. The economic argument for secession has weakened along with revenues from North Sea oil production. Worth about £4bn back then, they are now under £1bn and will be difficult to replace, Lex concluded.&#xa0;</p> <p>Scotland's other economic argument for leaving the British union is so it can rejoin the European one. A slower vaccine rollout on the continent has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfd5de3e-70a5-4bb3-b1bc-5108a996bd8f\">put AstraZeneca in the line of fire</a> of the bloc's politicians. The UK drugmaker has said Britain will get first dibs on vaccines coming from its factories, a claim the EU contests. Lex thought shareholder indifference to the spat was unwise. Especially considering that half of AstraZeneca's sales originate in the region.</p> <p>US investors are steering well out of the flight path of aerospace group Boeing. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125ae5da-6728-4eae-bfc3-a0a0cc9c8086\">Fourth-quarter earnings</a> revealed an operating loss of $23 per share and cash burn of $18bn that sent shares lower on Wednesday. Despite total debts of $62bn, the group has managed to retain its investment-grade credit rating. An equity raise has been mooted but is yet to arrive. Shares, still down by half from two years ago, offer a recovery opportunity.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Whiffin<br></strong><em>Lex writer</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac7389f1-41d8-46b6-bc42-32ac603b7f91\">GameStop: flash mob vs Wall Street</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e812d503-5df0-4820-b437-7b0d9b81ced3\">Asia stock frenzy: margins for error</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b1e595e-bc3f-434f-96b1-cd205284d83e\">PBoC/China stocks: damp course</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccf5205b-deef-4c7e-b033-2c42741d1147\">Electric vehicles/Spacs: double bubble</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2c0b21e-b2d7-4c6a-b4b7-3a855a588675\">AMC: grindhouse</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7d733be-9c40-4331-9633-534e0f80b713\">Apollo: fade to Black</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b812c65c-cabb-47d2-bcde-3f34774d4f81\">Scottish independence/oil: gutsy</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfd5de3e-70a5-4bb3-b1bc-5108a996bd8f\">AstraZeneca/Covid-19 vaccine: jab grab</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125ae5da-6728-4eae-bfc3-a0a0cc9c8086\">Boeing: runway blues</a></p><p>Source: Andrew Whiffin 2021 'Best of Lex: trust issues' FT.com 29 January.
