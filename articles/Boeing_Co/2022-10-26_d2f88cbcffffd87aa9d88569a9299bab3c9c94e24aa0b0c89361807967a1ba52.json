  "title": "U.S. News: Ruling by Judge Puts 737 MAX Settlement In Limbo",
  "text": "<p>The consequence of that breach, according to U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, is that the families can continue to challenge Boeing's settlement, which spared the company from an indictment. Boeing admitted that two employees misled the Federal Aviation Administration about the workings of the 737 MAX's automated flight-control system, which was largely blamed for pushing the aircraft into fatal nosedives in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019.</p><p>Judge O'Connor, of the U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, hasn't yet ruled on what should happen next, but the deal is now in limbo. The families have argued that he has the authority to rescind what they have called Boeing's immunity from prosecution, forcing the DOJ's hand to redo the deal with their input. The Justice Department, Boeing and the families also could appeal the judge's decisions.</p><p>\"The judge is sending a signal . . . how someone is considered a victim is much broader than how you, DOJ, are defining it,\" said Michael Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who is chairman of Cole Schotz PC's white-collar practice. \"The DOJ is going to have to be mindful of that in the future. It gives victims greater leverage -- not only in oversight, but input, into settlements.\"</p><p>The families have challenged prosecutors' failure to notify them about the settlement -- also known as a deferred-prosecution agreement -- under which Boeing paid $2.5 billion, admitted its employees' wrongdoing and agreed to serve a sort of probationary sentence. If the company complies with the law for 3 1/2 years, the charges would be dropped.</p><p>The families have argued the deal misallocated blame at Boeing. The problem with the 737 MAX's development wasn't \"limited to the conduct of a few rogue employees,\" they argued in court filings. Prosecutors charged Boeing's former chief technical pilot, who was acquitted of fraud after a trial.</p><p>At a court hearing in May, federal prosecutor Jerrob Duffy said the government found \"extremely limited\" evidence of criminal intent confined to a couple of employees.</p><p>Federal judges typically interpret their authority over deferred-prosecution agreements narrowly, said Brandon Garrett, a professor at Duke University School of Law. Judge O'Connor could reject the settlement, but he couldn't by himself rewrite its terms, Mr. Garrett said.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who met with the families in January, declined to comment on the ruling Monday, citing the continuing litigation. The Justice Department at that time apologized for not meeting with the families before finalizing the settlement in January 2021.</p><p>---</p><p>Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p>",
