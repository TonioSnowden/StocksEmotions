  "text": "<p>   The White House requested an initial $773 billion budget for the Pentagon in fiscal 2023, up 4% from the prior year and the starting point for discussions with Congress, elevated by the continuing war in Ukraine. </p><p>   The request, released Monday, continues the Pentagon's focus on what the White House called the \"pacing\" threat of China, which has rapidly expanded its military forces with more advanced weaponry. </p><p>   Pentagon leaders on Monday called Russia a secondary \"acute\" threat, though the request was finalized before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month and allocated just $300 million in military support, on top of the $3.6 billion recently agreed by Congress. </p><p>   The Biden administration's military budget request focuses on development of new weapons systems, especially refreshing America's arsenal of long-range nuclear missiles delivered from bombers, land-based silos and submarines. </p><p>   The request will be sent to Congress, which typically changes the amounts spent on individual weapons systems, such as the F-35 combat jet made by Lockheed Martin Corp. Analysts said they don't expect a final budget to be approved before the midterm elections in November. </p><p>   The overall request for military spending of $813 billion, which includes departments outside the Pentagon, is also up 4% from the prior year. However, inflation left the budget request up just 1.5% in real terms from funding in the 2022 budget, Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord said at a briefing. </p><p>   The U.S. spends more by far on defense than any other country, with watchdogs such as the Project on Government Oversight estimating an annual budget of over $1 trillion on national security. That estimate includes the Department of Veterans Affairs and the cost of servicing debt from previous defense spending. </p><p>   Shares in military contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Corp. have been trading around all-time highs in recent weeks. Analysts attributed the gains to investor expectations of higher global military spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially among European governments such as Germany. </p><p>   Northrop Grumman is developing a new U.S. bomber and intercontinental ballistic missiles, while General Dynamics Corp. is building new submarines. Planned U.S. purchases of Lockheed Martin F-35 combat jets were trimmed from recent years, while Boeing-made fighters and refueling tankers secured more funding. </p><p>   Boeing in recent years lost out to Northrop Grumman on deals to build the B-21 long-range bomber and new nuclear missiles. On Monday, Boeing said Leanne Caret would step down in April as head of its defense business, succeeded by Ted Colbert, who currently leads its services unit. </p><p></p>",
