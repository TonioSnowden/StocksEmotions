  "title": "Technology:  NASA Looks to Suppliers  To Cut Costs for Rockets  ----  By Micah Maidenberg",
  "text": "<p>   NASA's costly rocket program could be the last time the agency mounts such an effort, according to some former NASA officials and space industry executives, as private space companies attempt to build cheaper vehicles more quickly. </p><p>   Next month, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans another round of tests for a rocket built under its Space Launch System program, as the agency's moon-rocket effort is called, and other hardware. NASA intends to use SLS rockets as part of missions to return astronauts to the lunar surface, and later this year, plans an uncrewed test flight of an SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft it will blast to orbit. </p><p>   Some former NASA and industry officials say such rocket projects may be increasingly unworkable, following delays with the SLS effort and rising costs. Companies such as Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., meanwhile, are developing their own rockets -- potentially making NASA even more of a client of private-sector operators in the future. </p><p>   \"The launch industry is at a point where the technology is so mature that it may not be necessary to have the U.S. government invest in it,\" said Dan Goldin, a former NASA administrator. \"It may be we're at a tipping point with this rocket.\" </p><p>   Leaders at NASA have defended the program, saying there aren't at present alternatives as powerful as SLS vehicles, and have pledged to reduce costs. The SLS rockets cost the agency an estimated $22.3 billion as of last summer, with billions more expected to be spent on the first few flights. </p><p>   The huge vehicles are meant to launch Orion spacecraft, which are designed to carry astronauts on future missions. Those ships, developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., have cost the agency billions in additional funding. NASA wants to use an SLS rocket and Orion ship as part a flight that would return astronauts to the moon in 2025. </p><p>   The space agency followed its longtime playbook for the SLS rockets, hiring private companies such as Boeing Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. to develop the vehicles. For decades, NASA tapped aerospace contractors to build rockets like the Saturn V vehicle, which blasted spacecraft carrying astronauts to the moon. The agency owned and operated those rockets. </p><p>   A dozen years ago, Congress directed NASA to acquire a powerful rocket system, saying the vehicles would allow the agency to conduct deeper-space missions. </p><p>   As of August 2021, Boeing held NASA contracts valued at $11.1 billion related to its work on different stages of SLS rockets, according to NASA's inspector general. Northrop Grumman had a contract with NASA valued at $4.3 billion at the time to provide booster hardware for the vehicles. </p><p>   Paul Martin, the NASA inspector general, in March described the expected costs, including ground operations, for the first four launches of SLS rockets and Orion spacecraft as unsustainable. </p><p>   A Boeing spokeswoman said NASA development costs, after adjusting for inflation, for SLS have been a quarter of those for Saturn V. Costs will continue to become more affordable as teams move from vehicle development to operations, she said. </p><p>   Northrop Grumman has incorporated lessons learned from its role in the rocket's first planned orbital launch into preparations for the second flight, reducing hardware costs and its development timeline, Wendy Williams, vice president for propulsion systems at the company, said. </p><p></p>",
