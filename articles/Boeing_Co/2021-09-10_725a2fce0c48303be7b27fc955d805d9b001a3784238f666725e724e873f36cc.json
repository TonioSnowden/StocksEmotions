  "text": "<p>   KABUL -- Afghanistan's Taliban authorities allowed 113 Americans, U.S. permanent residents and holders of other Western passports to leave the country on a flight to Qatar, the first such departure by air since U.S. forces withdrew in August. </p><p>   While Qatari officials initially said the Qatar Airways Boeing 777 that landed in Kabul on Thursday afternoon would carry 200 people, not all of those who had been scheduled to fly reached the airport on time. There will be another such flight on Friday, Qatar's special envoy Mutlaq al-Qahtani said at a joint airport news conference with the chief Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. </p><p>   Thursday's flight marked the resumption of international passenger links between the Afghan capital and the rest of the world, with dozens of Qatari special forces guarding the tarmac and prviding security inside the international terminal during check-in and screening. </p><p>   U.S. troops had disabled and destroyed some of the airport's flight-control equipment as they departed on Aug. 30, and Qatari technical teams spent the past several days making the airport operational for daytime flights. \"Kabul airport is fully up and running,\" Mr. Qahtani said. </p><p>   U.S. citizens and others who boarded Thursday's flight were almost exclusively of Afghan origin, many of whom had visited relatives and then became stranded once the Afghan government precipitously collapsed mid-August. In addition to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, passengers included citizens of Canada, Germany, the U.K. and Ukraine, a person familiar with the flight's details said. The passengers said they received word of the flight only hours earlier as they were summoned to the Serena Hotel in the heart of Kabul. </p><p>   State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. invited more than 30 American citizens and legal permanent residents to board the flight, but that not all of them had accepted. </p><p>   Some people had medical issues, others chose to remain with family members who couldn't leave and a few needed more time to make a decision about whether to leave, he said. </p><p>   From the hotel, Qatari diplomats and soldiers facilitated the transportation of the passengers to the airport. Once at the international terminal, passengers were divided by nationality. The U.S. citizens present were mostly too traumatized by the ordeal to speak to a reporter. </p><p>   One man from Maryland, accompanied by his wife and four children, had come to Kabul six months ago to take care of his ailing mother. Since the fall of the capital on Aug. 15, the family had been hiding out in their home, too scared to venture out. \"We thought we would never leave Afghanistan,\" he said. \"The Taliban had come to the neighboring house, asking about us.\" </p><p>   Another family, from Washington, D.C., included only one U.S. citizen -- a 6-month-old girl -- and her parents, both of them green-card holders. \"I was afraid -- so much,\" said the father, a 37-year-old who received a U.S. green card because he worked with U.S. forces in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. He said he received a call from the State Department on Thursday morning instructing him to show up at the Serena Hotel. </p><p>   Aron Niazi, 40 years old, an employee of Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany, came to Kabul with his wife and three children to visit Afghan relatives in July. \"A bad idea!\" he exclaimed. The family had tried to come to the airport 10 times since Aug. 15 and narrowly escaped the Islamic State suicide bombing that killed some 200 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members, he said. When not trying to enter the airport, the family was hiding in a neighbor's home. </p><p>   \"The last three weeks, they were not good,\" Mr. Niazi said. \"My family here, I don't know what will happen to them.\" </p><p>   The Taliban have consistently pledged to allow foreigners to leave unimpeded. </p><p>   In Washington, National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne praised the flight as a \"positive first step\" in efforts to help U.S. citizens, legal residents, and Afghans who worked with the U.S. who want to get out of Afghanistan. </p><p>   \"The Taliban have been cooperative in facilitating the departure of American citizens and lawful permanent residents on charter flights,\" she said. \"They have shown flexibility, and they have been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort.\" </p><p>   Everyone on the flight had a valid passport and, if required, visa, a Qatari official said. </p><p>   In the final two weeks of August, the U.S. and partner nations airlifted out of Kabul some 120,000 foreigners and Afghans who had helped the West during the 20-year war. </p><p>   Thursday's flight didn't address the issue of tens of thousands of Afghans at risk who haven't been able to escape. The U.S. has estimated that the majority of Afghans who qualify for the so-called special immigrant visa because of having helped the U.S. military and civilian efforts remain stranded in Afghanistan. </p><p>   \"Today's evacuation of American citizens was a fantastic first step,\" said Amed Khan, president of the Zaka Khan Foundation that has been helping get people out of Afghanistan. </p><p>   While Washington in August said it had received commitments from the Taliban to allow Afghans with clearance to enter foreign nations to fly out, the country's new authorities want to prevent a brain drain. </p><p>   At meetings on Sunday with the United Nations' undersecretary general and emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, Taliban leaders were \"furious with the evacuation of skilled and educated people, who are greatly needed to rebuild the country,\" according to an internal U.N. readout of the conversations that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Taliban officials told organizers working on the charter flights they would allow U.S. citizens and others with valid passports and visas to fly out of Kabul, but not from Mazar-e-Sharif. At the same time, U.S. officials started calling Americans waiting in Mazar-e-Sharif for flights and told them to come to Kabul. </p><p></p>",
