  "title": "Business News: Boeing Sells Five 787 Dreamliners to Aircraft Lessor",
  "text": "<p>Boeing's business has suffered in recent years. It has been trailing in orders for narrow-body aircraft such as the 737 MAX, and while it has been ahead in orders for wide-bodies like the 787, the delivery pause has choked off an important source of cash.</p><p>Peter Anderson, AerCap's chief commercial officer, said jets like the Dreamliner used in international long-haul travel are in increasing demand as air travel recovers from the depths of the pandemic.</p><p>\"We see that market coming back strongly,\" he said while announcing the deal Tuesday at the Farnborough International Air Show near London.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier Tuesday.</p><p>Separately, Boeing on Tuesday said it struck a deal to sell 30 of the 737 MAX jets to a private-investment firm that will place the single-aisle jets with discount carriers. The deal comes with a commitment by the customer, 777 Partners, to buy up to 36 more.</p><p>Miami-based 777 Partners has placed aircraft with carriers such as Canadian discount carrier Flair Airlines Ltd.</p><p>The deal is for the 737 MAX 8 variant of the family. On Monday, Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would buy 100 737 MAX 10 jets, the longest and latest variety of the jet, with options to buy 30 more. Both orders represent a shot in the arm for the aircraft, which has been beset by a nearly two-year grounding after two deadly accidents.</p><p>Delta said Tuesday it would also buy 12 Airbus A220s, bringing its total for the former Bombardier aircraft to 107 aircraft. The U.S. carrier had 56 of the jets operating in its fleet as of the end of June.</p><p>---</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
