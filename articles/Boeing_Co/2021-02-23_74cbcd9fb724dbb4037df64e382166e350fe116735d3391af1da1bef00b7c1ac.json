  "text": "<p>Mr. Sumwalt said investigators are looking into why an outer covering known as a cowling detached, as well as why the damaged engine remained on fire even after the fuel had been shut off by the flight crew.</p><p>Last weekend's incident was the third in a string of failures involving the same engine and aircraft types in recent years. U.S. regulators had previously ordered stepped-up inspections of fan blades after an earlier engine failure on another United flight on a Boeing 777 in 2018. Then in December, an engine failed during a Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. flight to Tokyo, prompting the FAA's fresh scrutiny.</p><p>There were similarities between the incident in Japan and the one in Colorado. Japan's Transport Safety Board said a fan blade that broke off from that engine showed signs of metal fatigue. Another blade was broken roughly in half.</p><p>The FAA said Monday it had been \"evaluating whether to adjust blade inspections\" following December's incident after reviewing maintenance and inspection records and conducting a metallurgical examination of a fan-blade fragment to determine the cause of a fracture in the engine failure.</p><p>Mr. Sumwalt said investigators would examine regulators' response to the December engine failure as part of the U.S. agency's probe into the most recent incident. \"We'll be looking at that to see what could have been done, what should have been done, if anything at all,\" he said.</p><p>Japan Airlines moved on its own after the December engine failure, opting to replace and inspect fan blades on those engines at shorter intervals than the inspection schedule laid out in the FAA's 2019 directive, a spokesman said.</p><p>Saturday's engine failure -- which in effect led to a swift global grounding of a subset of Boeing 777s so their engines can undergo immediate inspections -- is another example of how air-safety regulators are grappling with serious aviation incidents and accidents after Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX crisis.</p><p>The FAA said Sunday it would soon issue an emergency order requiring immediate and stepped-up inspections of certain Pratt &amp; Whitney engines on some Boeing 777s, which are often used on long-haul, international flights. The FAA said Monday its safety experts were still reviewing \"all the available data\" on the latest incident.</p><p>Boeing and U.S. regulators have faced sharp criticism in the past from lawmakers and crash victims' families for allowing the 737 MAX to continue flying with passengers after the first fatal accident of the aircraft in late 2018 before another crashed in early 2019. In all, 346 people died.</p><p>\"The experience with the MAX resonates throughout the industry,\" said Kenneth Quinn, an aviation attorney who served as chief counsel for the FAA. Certification officials, he said, \"will be remiss to ever be perceived as foot-dragging. They want to act decisively and swiftly.\"</p><p>The global sidelining at the weekend of wide-body 777 jets powered by certain Pratt &amp; Whitney engines is the latest headache for Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of aerospace company Raytheon Technologies Corp.</p><p>For the Chicago-based plane maker, analysts said an engine failure during a United Airlines flight last weekend is far less impactful than the prolonged 737 MAX crisis following the two fatal crashes and world-wide grounding of that aircraft for nearly two years. No one was injured on the Honolulu-bound United flight, which returned safely to Denver on Saturday after an engine broke apart and scattered debris on a nearby town.</p><p>Boeing recommended grounding 128 of the jets, many of which are parked due to the pandemic, while regulators hammer out a new inspection plan. Japan's regulator also grounded planes with those Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.</p><p>The plane maker has said it was working with U.S. and Japanese regulators while the engine maker conducts more inspections.</p><p>The FAA said the engines on the United aircraft involved in Saturday's incident were covered by an early directive by the agency following the similar engine failure in 2018.</p><p>The agency declined to say when the engines underwent inspections, referring questions to the NTSB, which is the lead agency in the probe of Saturday's engine failure. A spokesman for United also referred questions about inspections to the NTSB.</p><p>Pratt &amp; Whitney said it would work with regulators on a step-up in inspections. It expects the affected planes to return to service, according to a person involved in discussions with Boeing and regulators.</p><p>Mr. Sumwalt said the safety board's investigators would examine the engine's maintenance and inspection records.</p><p>Older planes form the bedrock of profits at engine makers such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, which make a loss on most new sales to power Boeing and Airbus jets. The bulk of earnings comes from selling parts and servicing on the thousands of engines already installed.</p><p>More than 7,000 jets, a third of the world's fleet, remain parked because of weak demand.</p><p>---</p><p>Peter Landers contributed to this article.</p>",
