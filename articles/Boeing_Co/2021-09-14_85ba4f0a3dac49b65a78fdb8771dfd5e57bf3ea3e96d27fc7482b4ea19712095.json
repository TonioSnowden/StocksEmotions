  "title": "Boeing Raises Outlook on Travel Rebound; Aerospace company forecasts a $9 trillion market for its products over the next decade, with the pandemic wiping out two years of growth",
  "text": "<p>Boeing said the aviation industry had only lost two years of growth because of the pandemic and hadn't undermined airlines' need for thousands of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft over the next decade.</p><p>\"We are preparing for growth,\" Marc Allen, Boeing's chief strategy officer, told reporters as he outlined the company's forecast of a $9 trillion market for its commercial, defense and services businesses over the next decade, up from the $8.7 trillion estimate two years ago.</p><p>Airlines, plane makers and suppliers continue to debate whether the pandemic has fundamentally changed the industry. Boeing and Airbus SE are boosting production, which critics said may not be supported by a potentially permanent drop in business travel, changing route networks and environmental concerns.</p><p>Boeing was among the worst hit by the collapse in airline traffic last year, just as it worked to recover from the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX. For much of the last year the company has also been dealing with production problems that have halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner.</p><p>Those production problems have allowed Airbus to deliver almost twice as many jets as Boeing this year, though the U.S. company is outpacing its European rival in terms of orders.</p><p>Another 53 orders for Boeing in August pushed total deals to 683 for the year so far, versus 269 for Airbus.</p><p>Boeing's Mr. Allen said it wasn't yet clear whether business travel demand would bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, but that so far overall travel demand—including leisure trips—was encouraging. \"We feel right now somewhat hopeful that we're going to see traffic levels hold across segments,\" he said. \"But I think there's still a lot to learn on that.\"</p><p>Boeing lost almost $12 billion last year as sales fell to $58 billion, a level not seen since 2008.</p><p>The U.S. domestic recovery and cargo demand has spurred a slew of orders this year, and though Boeing finds itself almost locked out of new sales to China because of lingering trade disputes, it still expects sales to track a rebound in global economic growth.</p><p>\"The fundamentals for air travel have not changed,\" Darren Hulst, vice president of commercial marketing, told reporters.</p><p>Boeing's 10-year forecast envisages industrywide demand for over 19,000 new jets seating more than 90 passengers each over the next decade. Mr. Hulst said environmental concerns were spurring faster replacement of older jets, with 80% of the global fleet expected to be replaced over the next two decades.</p><p>E-commerce is boosting demand for freighter aircraft, while governments are holding on to military planes for longer, boosting revenue from spares and repairs, Mr. Hulst said.</p><p>Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Raises Outlook on Travel Rebound</p>",
