  "text": "<p>The restrictions are limited to flights from a handful of countries that typically encompass a relatively low percentage of international travel. Still, global airline shares sharply fell amid worry that the variant could take hold elsewhere and trigger broader travel restrictions just as many parts of the world start to fly again.</p><p>Shares in all three of the largest U.S. international airlines each fell by more than 8% in trading Friday. Shares of International Consolidated Airlines Group , the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, were down about 15% in European trading.</p><p>Boeing Co . shares were down more than 5%, while shares of rival Airbus SE had shed about 10% in Europe.</p><p>The European Union said Friday it would propose an emergency brake on travel between South Africa, a handful of neighboring countries and the 27-member bloc. Singapore's health ministry said it would restrict arrivals and transit for nonresidents who have traveled within 14 days to the region.</p><p>The U.K. on Thursday placed six southern African states on its red list of countries from which travelers have to quarantine in government-approved hotels. It went a step further Friday and halted all commercial and private passenger flights to and from those countries for two days.</p><p>Travel restrictions vary by country, but governments typically try to restrict flights taking off from affected countries or passengers who had passed through those nations recently. The U.S. ban applies to foreign nationals, but U.S. citizens and permanent residents will still be able to travel from the restricted countries -- similar to restrictions that were previously in place on travel from South Africa and several other countries.</p><p>British Airways said it was working through plans to assist customers currently in the region. Deutsche Lufthansa AG , which flies between Germany and South Africa 17 times a week, said it was continuing its flights to help German travelers return home and to maintain cargo transport.</p><p>The new rules mark another setback for long-haul carriers, which have been boosting capacity on international flights in recent weeks. The move comes less than a month after the Biden administration reopened U.S. borders, ending a regime of travel restrictions that kept out non-U.S. citizens from many countries, and instead required that most foreign nationals seeking to fly to the U.S. show proof of vaccination.</p><p>While Americans have largely resumed traveling domestically for vacations or to visit friends and family, international and business travel hasn't yet returned in full force. Airlines have said their global flights have been buoyed in recent weeks by loosening travel restrictions around the world.</p><p>Southern Africa is a relatively small component of U.S. airlines' route maps. United Airlines Holdings Inc . and Delta Air Lines Inc . are the only two U.S. carriers that fly to South Africa. United is scheduled to operate 87 flights between the two countries next month, including resuming nonstop service between Newark, N.J., and Cape Town, according to Cirium, an aviation data provider.</p><p>United said it will watch to see how the new restrictions impact demand, but it isn't planning any changes to its schedule. The airline still plans to restart Cape Town flights Dec. 1.</p><p>Delta said that Virgin Atlantic Ltd ., its partner airline, had canceled service between Johannesburg and London. Delta said it will monitor the new variant and any resulting travel restrictions, but the airline plans to continue flying between its Atlanta hub and Johannesburg -- service it operates three times a week.</p>",
