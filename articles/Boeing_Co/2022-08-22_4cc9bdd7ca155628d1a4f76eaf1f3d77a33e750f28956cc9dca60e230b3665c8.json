  "title": "Here's everything coming to Amazon's Prime Video in September 2022; Get ready for 'The Lord of the Rings' prequel series 'The Rings of Power,' and NFL Thursday Night Football",
  "text": "<p>Taking place in the Second Age of Middle Earth, thousands of years before the events of \"Lord of the Rings,\" the series will reveal how the kingdoms and alliances of men, elves and dwarves were forged — along with the magical rings — and detail the rise of an evil that their world has never before seen. The sprawling cast includes Morfydd Clark, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Sophia Nomvete, Ismael Cruz Cordova and Nazanin Boniandi.</p><p>The first two episodes will drop at once, with new episodes coming every Friday. The trailers look spectacular, and it should be interesting to see how \"Rings\" fares in a nearly head-to-head battle with another fantasy blockbuster, HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" prequel series \"House of the Dragon.\"</p><p>Amazon AMZN has committed even more money ($13.2 billion over 10 years) for exclusive rights to the most lucrative programming in the U.S. — NFL football. While Prime Video has streamed 11 Thursday-night games every season since 2017, this is the first time the games won't air anywhere else. Prime Video will stream 15 exclusive regular-season games Thursday Night Football games starting Sept. 15, with the Chiefs hosting the Chargers.</p><p>Also see: More monthly streaming picks at What's Worth Streaming</p><p>The rest of Prime's September lineup sort of pales in comparison, but includes the documentary movie \"Flight/Risk\" (Sept. 9), about the two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners; the Italian coming-of age drama series \"Prisma\" (Sept. 21); and Season 2 of the trans family drama \"September Mornings\" (Sept. 23).</p><p>Prime Video also has \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogies, and is adding movies such as \"Fight Club,\" \"He Got Game,\" \"Legally Blonde\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (all Sept. 1), as well all five seasons of the beloved high-school football drama \"Friday Night Lights\" (Sept. 1).</p><p>Here's the complete list of what's coming, as of Aug. 21 (release dates are subject to change):</p><p>What's coming in September 2022</p><p>Sept. 1American Ninja Warrior S12-13 (2022)Friday Night Lights S1-S5 (2007)Texicanas (2019)WAGS Miami S1-S2 (2022)21 Grams (2004)23:59 (2011)A Family Thing (1996)The Adjustment Bureau (2011)The Adventures of Buckraoo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984)American Beauty (1999)American Ninja (1985)American Ninja 2: The Confrontation (1987)American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt (1989)American Ninja 4: The Annihilation (1991)An American Werewolf in London (1981)Apartment 143 (2012)Autumn in New York (2000)Bad Influence (1990)Big Top Pee-Wee (1988)Black Sunday (1977)Blair Witch 2: The Book of Shadows (2000)The Blair Witch Project (1999)Cabin Fever (2003)Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (2009)The Clan (2015)Cold Creek Manor (2003)Crazy Heart (2010)The Descent (2006)The Dilemma (2011)Dust 2 Glory (2017)Employee of the Month (2006)Europa Report (2013)The Expendables (2010)The Expendables 2 (2012)The Expendables 3 (2014)Failure to Launch (2006)Fight Club (1999)Frontera (2014)The Ghost and the Darkness (1996)Gorky Park (1983)Hard Eight (1997)He Got Game (1998)Heartburn (1986)Here Comes the Devil (2012)How to Train Your Dragon (2010)I Saw The Devil (2010)I'm Still Here (2010)In Time (2011)Instructions Not Included (2013)Intersection (1994)Jason's Lyric (1994)Juan of the Dead (2012)Legally Blonde (2001)Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde (2003)Let the Right One In (2008)The Lifeguard (2013)Love Story (1970)Loving Pablo (2018)Mandrill (2009)The Mod Squad (1999)Moonlight &amp; Valentino (1995)Mother!
