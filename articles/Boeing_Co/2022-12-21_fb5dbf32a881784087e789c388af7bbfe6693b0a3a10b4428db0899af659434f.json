  "title": "The FBI vs. Comedians; How do the bureau's interventions at Twitter comply with the First Amendment?",
  "text": "<p>Has Congress authorized the FBI to be the enforcer of Twitter's terms of service? If the House or Senate ever does contemplate such an odd legislative project, surely there are a few civil libertarians left in the Congress who would flag the risk that the social media company would simply become an agent of federal abuse.</p><p>As any other person or business who receives a request from the FBI would tend to do, the Twitter crew took such communications seriously, and ended up suspending some accounts, according to Mr. Taibbi. If the bureau has a compelling reason why it is urging a private firm to abridge the ability of private speakers to communicate in a public forum, perhaps FBI officials can share it at an upcoming House hearing.</p><p>Mr. Taibbi notes a few of the accounts targeted by the FBI that Twitter did not agree to suspend, and one wonders how the bureau could regard them as deserving of federal investigation. Here's the description on one account:</p><p>Retired. Curmudgeon &amp; righteously irritated... World class wiseass.</p><p>Another American the FBI encouraged Twitter to silence by flagging her as a possible violator of the company's terms of service describes herself as a \"Board certified Astrologist.\" During holiday travel this week she is bound to earn many new followers with this bold declaration of conscience:</p><p>Free airport luggage is a fundamental human right.</p><p>Some may argue that it can be difficult todifferentiate between over-the-top satire and Biden administration policy, but the FBI flagged her to Twitter for tweeting that she was a ballot counter who would add a vote for Democrats for each negative comment to another of her tweeted gags about ballot-counting.</p><p>Where's the justification for these FBI intrusions into the moderating of online speech?</p><p>***</p><p>In Other News</p><p>The Era of the Stay-at-Home Economy Gabriel Greschler reports for the San Jose Mercury News:</p><p>Silicon Valley as an economic juggernaut has reigned supreme throughout the pandemic compared to its rivals in the Sunbelt and Pacific Northwest, newly released numbers show.</p><p>According to gross domestic product data released this month, Santa Clara County saw the largest growth in the country between 2019 and 2021 among areas with more than half a million residents — an eye-popping increase of 19% — from $307 billion to $382 billion...</p><p>If Santa Clara County were its own nation, it would be the 38th largest world economy... Though Silicon Valley takes the gold, its challengers are still posting impressive numbers. Coming in second is Austin's Travis County— an up-and-coming technology hub dubbed the \"Silicon Hills\" — which grew 14%, from $109 billion to $129 billion over the same three-year period. Seattle's King County — home to Microsoft and Amazon, with Boeing operating in and around the county — grew 13%, from $277 billion to $328 billion.</p><p>***</p><p>Sorry, Taxpayers, But D.C. Is Still a Spending Juggernaut Steve Moore of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity laments yet another disappointment in Washington's massive pending omnibus bill. Mr. Moore writes via email that pay-as-you-go rules meant to force automatic spending restraint have been gutted once again:</p><p>UGGH!</p><p>We have urged Republicans not to agree to waive PAYGO budget caps without replacing the scheduled automatic $130 billion with a package of spending cuts – starting with ending the $80 billion for 87,000 new IRS agents.</p><p>Instead, the omnibus does even worse than waiving PAYGO – it ends the budget caps for two years. Worse, the $130 billion doesn't count in the bill's official $1.7 trillion price tag – so the REAL cost of the bill is closer to $1.83 trillion.</p><p>But what's a few tens of billions of dollars we don't have between friends?</p><p>***</p><p>Everything Seemingly Is Spinning Out of Control \"Jetsons-style robots are invading Chicago-area hospitals,\" blares a Chicago Tribune headline. Lisa Schencker reports:</p><p>For months, Moxi robots have been roaming the halls of at least three Chicago-area hospitals: Elmhurst, Edward Hospital in Naperville and MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn. They deliver medication and shuttle supplies and small pieces of equipment across the facilities. It's the latest strategy aimed at dealing with a nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical workers that has left many hospitals scrambling for help.</p><p>\"With the staffing shortage, we're always looking for ways to take non-clinical tasks away from the clinical staff, especially repetitive tasks,\" said Dr. Kimberley Darey, Elmhurst chief medical officer. She noted that Moxi does not work with patients.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.
