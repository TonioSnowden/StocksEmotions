  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 ticked up 7.45 points, or 0.2%, to 4187.62, also setting a record -- its 24th of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 61.92 points, or 0.2%, to 33981.57 and is just 0.6% below its high from earlier this month. All three indexes posted modest declines last week.</p><p>Technology stocks have lagged behind other sectors this year, including financials, industrials and energy. While highflying tech stocks led the market's rebound from the depths of last year's coronavirus-fueled selloff, investors in recent months have pivoted toward shares of companies with less lofty valuations, as well as economically sensitive stocks that could benefit from a broad post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>More than one-third of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 are reporting quarterly results this week. Investors will be watching to see whether the earnings justify rich valuations for some companies, especially in tech.</p><p>Tesla, one of investors' most favored stocks, reported a record quarterly profit as it released earnings after the closing bell. Apple and Facebook are scheduled to report Wednesday, followed by Amazon.com on Thursday.</p><p>\"Earnings didn't really matter over the last couple of quarters because investors were focusing on the coronavirus,\" said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at private bank Arbuthnot Latham. \"They'll start to look under the bonnet more than they have.\"</p><p>Other companies scheduled to report this week include Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor and Mastercard.</p><p>Stocks have been jittery in recent days after flare-ups of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan triggered concerns about the pace of the global economic recovery.</p><p>Money managers' risk appetite also was jolted by worry that the Biden administration may boost taxes.</p><p>The Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee is set to hold its monthly policy meeting this week. Investors will be on alert for any change in tone and outlook from the Fed following a spate of strong U.S. economic data. Loose monetary policy from the U.S. central bank has underpinned the stock market's rally, and any sign of a shift toward a more inflation-fighting posture could spook the markets.</p><p>\"The glaring risk is that the market loses confidence in the Fed's handling of inflation,\" said Eric Mintz, co-portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management. \"If the market thinks the Fed is behind the eight ball, that could derail things.\"</p><p>Despite progress on vaccinations, the pandemic remains another risk for investors. India has experienced a surge in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks after loosening restrictions.</p><p>\"This is a clear setback and adds significant uncertainty,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"It is a reminder that investors, throughout the course of this year, are going to be dealing with this huge risk of the resurgence of Covid-19.\"</p><p>Futures of Brent crude oil, the international energy benchmark, fell 0.7% to $65.65 a barrel.</p><p>In corporate news, Albertsons tumbled 96 cents, or 5%, to $18.22 after the supermarket chain reported a quarterly loss and said it expects sales to slow this year from 2020, when coronavirus lockdowns prompted heavy demand for food from grocers.</p><p>In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin jumped 8% to $53,297.40. The digital currency has rebounded since falling below $50,000 last week.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%. Early Tuesday in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.2%, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi was down 0.3%. S&amp;P stock futures were up less than 0.1%.</p>",
