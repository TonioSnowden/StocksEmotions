  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. said it plans to eliminate about 150 finance jobs in the U.S. as part of a push to simplify its corporate structure. </p><p>   The expected reduction follows what the company said were earlier corporate staffing cuts in areas such as information technology, aimed at reducing complexity so Boeing can focus more resources on engineering, manufacturing and product development. </p><p>   Some of the U.S. finance positions to be eliminated this year would be relocated to India, people familiar with the matter said. They said the company may make additional, similar job cuts in coming months. </p><p>   Boeing said in a January regulatory filing that it ended last year with about 142,000 employees worldwide. </p><p></p>",
