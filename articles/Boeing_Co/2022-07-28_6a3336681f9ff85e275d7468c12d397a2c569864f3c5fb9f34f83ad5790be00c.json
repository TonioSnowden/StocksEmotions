  "title": "How the Pilot Shortage Made JetBlue Overpay for Spirit; JetBlue's logical choice for a merger would have been Alaska Airlines, but a lack of skilled pilots makes executives unwilling to mix Boeing and Airbus fleets",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday, JetBlue announced the acquisition of Spirit after the latter terminated its merger agreement with Frontier Airlines Wednesday. Spirit's board was unable to convince shareholders to choose Frontier's logical proposal over their own self interest, which is to get more money from JetBlue. It is a painful blow for Frontier chairman Bill Franke, who led Spirit's pioneering conversion to an ultra-low-cost model between 2006 and 2013. Merging the two carriers would have been the culmination of his work, delivering straightforward scale gains by joining two like-minded companies.</p><p>Yet from the left field came JetBlue, which fears being left out of another round of consolidation and is willing to overpay to avoid it. After years of mergers, the \"Big Four\" U.S. airlines finished the prepandemic period with roughly 80% of domestic seat capacity. A race to create worthy challengers was bound to begin.</p><p>The most intuitive way for it to go was to have Spirit merge with Frontier and JetBlue with Alaska Airlines. Instead, consolidation will start between two carriers that have little in common, leading to a heap of questions about integration.</p><p>Unit costs highlight this. Spirit and Frontier are expected to spend slightly above 6 cents per available seat-mile this year, excluding fuel, according to Visible Alpha. At the other end of the spectrum, a full-service airline such as United Airlines has unit costs of around 11 cents, because it caters to a premium clientele and faces stronger demands from a unionized workforce. Sandwiched between the two, at around 9 cents, are JetBlue and Alaska, which are budget airlines but offer a more premium product with onboard amenities to passengers in big metropolitan areas.</p><p>Sure, acquiring Spirit will boost JetBlue's presence in key urban leisure markets such as Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. But incorporating Alaska's West Coast-focused network would have created even more advantageous transcontinental connections to primary airports in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland. This is what JetBlue wanted when it lost a bidding war for Virgin America against Alaska in 2016.</p><p>So why not just buy Alaska? The rub is that JetBlue mostly operates the Airbus A320 aircraft family, as do Spirit and Frontier, whereas Alaska long trumpeted its \"Proudly All Boeing\" approach.</p><p>A few years ago, this wouldn't have been a good enough reason to reject a more compatible partnerâ€”after all, Alaska still has 44 Airbus jets it inherited from Virgin. But right now sourcing pilots is the key variable driving executives' decisions. Fleet commonality reduces costs and complexities, whereas splitting it in two essentially means halving the pool of pilots to tap, and leads to compounding training and certification costs.</p><p>Global pilot demand is on track to surpass supply in 2024, according to fresh projections by consulting firm Oliver Wyman. In North America this point has already been crossed as the pandemic accelerated retirements, and airlines are now rushing to rehire thousands of employees at breakneck speed, which is pushing up labor costs. Oliver Wyman forecasts a 29,000 pilot shortage in the region by 2032.</p><p>This is why Alaska Chief Executive Ben Minicucci can't wait to get rid of his Airbus planes. It probably also explains JetBlue's decision to pay an eye-watering premium for Spirit's fleet, even at the cost of reconfiguring it for a different kind of product.</p><p>Whether the subject is airline schedules, chaos at airports or even mergers and acquisitions, staffing shortages now seem to be steering the fate of the entire aviation industry.</p><p>Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com</p><p>How the Pilot Shortage Made JetBlue Overpay for Spirit</p>",
