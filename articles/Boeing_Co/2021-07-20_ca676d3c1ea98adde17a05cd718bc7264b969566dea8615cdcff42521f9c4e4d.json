  "text": "<p>    Jeff Bezos has big ambitions in space. The Amazon.com Inc. founder plans to make his own first visit with a flight scheduled to launch at 9 a.m EDT on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. </p><p>   The New Shepard rocket and capsule that will carry Mr. Bezos and three others was developed by his Blue Origin company, named for the belief that this blue planet is just the starting point for humankind's future. </p><p>   Mr. Bezos is putting himself to the test on his rocket's inaugural crewed flight. He has said he hopes this will be the first of thousands that can make space travel safe and routine, and cheap enough to allow millions to follow. Eventually. </p><p>    Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. also plans to take tourists to space after flying its founder there earlier this month. Blue Origin aims eventually to use its space exploration to try to tap the energy and material resources of the solar system. </p><p>   The New Shepard can carry six people, with the rocket sending the capsule up more than 62 miles. The reusable rocket and capsule being used on Tuesday are making their third flight -- Blue Origin has tested the system with 15 autonomous flights without passengers. The capsule separates and affords a few minutes of weightlessness before it descends and lands in the nearby Texas desert. The rocket lands vertically back at the launch site. </p><p>   Blue Origin uses a conventional rocket and space capsule that launches and lands vertically, so it is quicker than Virgin Galactic's vehicle to reach the edge of space, and the entire flight is 11 minutes. Virgin Galactic employs an aircraft to lift its six-seat space plane aloft, before releasing it, firing a rocket to take it higher. The space plane then glides back unpowered to the ground, with the whole trip taking about 90 minutes. </p><p>   Mr. Bezos will be joined by his brother Mark; flying legend and longtime aerospace regulator Wally Funk; and a standby passenger. The winner who paid almost $30 million at a charity auction for a seat on the first flight was a no-show, so Blue Origin moved up Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen from a later flight to become its first paying customer. The second-place offer from an unidentified bidder in May's auction was $27 million. </p><p>   Blue Origin plans two more customer flights this year, with the next scheduled as early as September, but has yet to announce any formal pricing beyond the results of the May auction. The company said you can email if interested. </p><p>    Boeing Co.'s Starliner is scheduled to make its second attempt to reach the International Space Station on July 30. The uncrewed test flight follows a mission in December 2019 that failed to reach the correct orbit. A crewed mission could follow by the end of the year, with Starliner joining the Crew Dragon made by Elon Musk's SpaceX as a certified space taxi. </p><p>   SpaceX is building a huge launch tower on the Texas coast to send its own Starship into orbit. The uncrewed mission would be atop a Super Heavy rocket, and the tower is designed to catch the vehicles when they return. </p><p></p>",
