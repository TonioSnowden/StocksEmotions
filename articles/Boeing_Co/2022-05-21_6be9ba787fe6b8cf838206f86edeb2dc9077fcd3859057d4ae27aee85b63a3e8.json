  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Boeing's Starliner Docks With Space Station  ----  By Micah Maidenberg",
  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co.'s Starliner spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station, an important milestone on a test mission where the vehicle faced some technical issues. </p><p>   The company's Starliner vehicle connected with the space station at 8:28 p.m. ET Friday, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. </p><p>   Next week, the vehicle is expected to depart the station and land under parachutes in a desert site in the western part of the U.S., according to NASA. </p><p>   Completing the mission would set the stage for Boeing to use Starliner for high-profile astronaut flights. It would also give the company a win as it faces challenges with many of its aircraft programs, including the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets. </p><p>   Before docking with the research facility, the Starliner completed a series of maneuvers to demonstrate its capabilities. Flight controllers have been gathering information about how the vehicle operates in space. The capsule isn't carrying crew members on the demonstration mission. </p><p>   After launching Thursday evening, two thrusters used for maneuvering the Starliner failed, but a third functioned as expected, allowing the vehicle to stay on track. The thrusters that failed were among a subset of those devices on the vehicle. Boeing said earlier Friday that teams concluded a drop in pressure caused the two thrusters to cut off. </p><p>   With other thrusters available, the failures don't \"pose a risk to the rest of the flight test,\" the company said. Boeing also said teams were investigating an issue with a thermal-cooling device on the Starliner, but subsystems were maintaining stable temperatures. </p><p>   So far, Boeing hasn't been able to complete an uncrewed test mission. A software error botched an attempt in 2019, and valves on the vehicle became stuck last summer before a makeup launch, causing months of delays while Boeing and NASA worked to address the issue. </p><p>   The capsule carried food and other cargo to the space station and is set to bring other items back to Earth, with a scheduled departure from the station on May 25. </p><p>   The space agency currently uses vehicles operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX for astronaut missions to the space station but wants to have two U.S. companies available to provide that service. </p><p></p>",
