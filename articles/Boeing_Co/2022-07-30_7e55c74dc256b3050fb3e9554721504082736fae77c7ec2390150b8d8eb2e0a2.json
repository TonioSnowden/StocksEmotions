  "title": "Defense Companies Hurt by Staffing Shortages Amid Growing Weapons Demand; Lockheed, Raytheon, others say labor challenges are adding to wider supply-chain problems seen lingering into next year",
  "text": "<p>Military contractors said they are experiencing staffing issues that labor experts expect to percolate through the wider economy. The companies said an aging pool of specialized workers, especially engineers with security clearance, hasn't returned as they did after previous downturns.</p><p>Weapons makers, which are typically working now on orders received two, three or even five years ago, are gearing up for higher demand driven by the conflict in Ukraine and China's military buildup.</p><p>The U.S. has committed more than $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including Javelin and Stinger missiles, drones and radios. The Pentagon said most of this is coming from existing government stockpiles, and industry executives don't expect the impact of new equipment sales to come until next year.</p><p>The U.S. defense budget, which just a year ago had been expected to be flat through 2025, is rising. A host of European companies have committed to boosting budgets in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.</p><p>Greg Hayes, Raytheon's chief executive, said it was caught flat-footed when staff furloughed at the start of the pandemic didn't return in the numbers expected, and a hoped-for improvement following the Omicron variant failed to materialize.</p><p>\"It is a hill to climb in the back half of the year,\" Mr. Hayes said on an investor call. While Raytheon and its suppliers typically secured 75% of those they had furloughed, this time only a quarter had returned. A recession that cools the jobs market may be the quickest fix, he said.</p><p>\"Labor is probably more of a challenge than the facilities themselves,\" said Chris Kubasik, CEO of L3Harris Technologies Inc., which has identified opportunities from Ukraine in military radios, night vision goggles, and intelligence and surveillance systems.</p><p>Companies have increased the number of job fairs to recruit new workers, in addition to bolstering pay and benefits, executives said.</p><p>Defense companies fared better than most industries when rolling shutdowns closed factories across the country in early 2020. The sector secured exemptions from state and federal government to remain open, reworking shop floors to protect staff and repurposing production lines to make ventilators and other equipment.</p><p>Almost 90,000 workers were laid off or furloughed, according to the Aerospace Industries Association, but by mid-2021 companies started to hire back workers. Many didn't return, and by the final quarter of last year, strains were starting to show in the supply chain, said some company executives.</p><p>The Omicron variant exacerbated the situation early this year, with absenteeism rates spiking, and the industry has struggled to recover as it has also wrestled with a tight nationwide labor market. The unemployment rate for aerospace engineers is less than 2%, and lower still for those with security clearance required to work on programs such as the Lockheed-led F-35 or the Air Force One replacement being built by Boeing.</p><p>\"It's crazy. We have had people accept the job and then never show up,\" said Jeff Kaney, CEO of Kaney Aerospace Inc. in Rockford, Ill.</p><p>Kaney Aerospace makes gears and motors for Airbus, Boeing and other big contractors supplying the U.S. Air Forceâ€”one of a cluster of companies in the Rockford area that hosts big plants operated by Raytheon, General Electric Co. and others. The firm employs around 100 staff, and vacancies have doubled over the past six months to around 12 positions, Mr. Kaney said.</p><p>When President Biden in May visited the Lockheed plant in Troy, Ala., that assembles Javelin missiles being used in Ukraine, it had 25 advertised vacancies among a staff of 400, according to the company. That number has remained unchanged despite the publicity from the visit and the company's own efforts to bolster hiring.</p><p>Lockheed has faced similar challenges at the plant in Greenville, S.C., that produces F-16 jet fighters. Jay Malave, the company's chief financial officer, said first deliveries have been delayed by a year, largely because of the difficulty in hiring enough employees.</p><p>The challenge is even more acute among Navy shipbuilders, where cramped working conditions made social-distancing difficult during the pandemic, leading to a buildup of uncompleted work that has proved tough to catch up on.</p><p>Jason Aiken, chief financial officer at General Dynamics Corp. said on its earnings call: \"It's less about parts or material availability. It's about the availability of labor, the price and availability of skilled labor.\"</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Defense Companies Hurt by Staffing Shortages Amid Growing Weapons Demand</p>",
