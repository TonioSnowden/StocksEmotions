  "title": "Air Mail: Airline Ventilation And Miles Frustration",
  "text": "<p>I have tried to find out which plane models have HEPA, and which don't. But I have been unable to come up with this info.</p><p>-- Thomas Wright, Indianapolis, Ind.</p><p>A: You are correct -- not all aircraft have hospital-grade air filtering that airlines tout as central to controlling viral spread in cabins. The laggards here are generally the smallest of regional jets, and many airlines have been phasing them out anyway. All large aircraft in use today have High Efficiency Particulate Air filters. (Older mainline jets that didn't are long gone.)</p><p>I checked with big U.S. airlines that use regional jets and found that American has Embraer E140 jets that don't have HEPA filters. The airline says they are phasing those 44-seat planes out.</p><p>Delta and United use Bombardier CRJ-200s that don't have HEPA filters, but they do use 100% fresh air in ventilation systems. So if no air is recycled, no air needs filtering. Delta also has Boeing 717s that don't have HEPA filters but also use 100% fresh air. Alaska Airlines says all of the regional aircraft in its network have HEPA filters.</p><p>Q: Imagine my surprise when I tried to transfer miles from my American Airlines account to my husband's so he could take our grandson on a Christmas trip, only to find the fee for doing so was more than the cost of buying the tickets outright! This seems totally unfair. I've earned those miles by traveling with AA. Why should I not be allowed to transfer them away for free?</p><p>I do understand if there were a small administrative fee of say, $10. But not the exorbitant rate of $15 per 1,000 miles I finally found by googling the question. It was not apparent on the AA site until they wanted my credit card. That didn't happen.</p><p>Do all airlines do this? What do you think?</p><p>-- Kay Sisk, Bonham, Texas</p><p>A: I think it's wrong. American, United, Delta and Southwest all charge mileage or point transfer fees that discourage transferring or catch unsuspecting consumers. Many customers probably are topping up accounts to get a mileage award and are willing to pay $15 or even $30 to get that needed 1,000 or 2,000 miles.</p><p>Southwest charges one penny per point -- a 5,000-point transfer costs $50. Delta charges one penny per mile -- which honestly is about the entire buying power of a Delta SkyMile -- plus a $30 processing fee. Transferring 5,000 miles would cost $80. ($75 at American.) United is even more expensive. Transferring 5,000 miles costs $75 plus a $30 processing fee, or $105 total.</p><p>Some carriers use Points.com to handle the actual transfer, though you'd think an airline could handle that internally. (Southwest's site makes this disclosure, for example.) Points.com has always been an expensive way to transfer points. Essentially there's a middleman making money. It's the same with buying miles -- it's always been a bad deal, unless there's a gigantic discount offered.</p><p>Some airlines have family sharing and pooling. JetBlue offers points pooling, where you and seven friends or family can combine points. Frontier and Hawaiian also offer family sharing. That makes their programs more valuable to occasional travelers.</p><p>Big airlines encourage accrual of miles, but often discourage redemption. Their frequent-flier programs are geared toward, well, frequent fliers who buy lots of tickets and are swimming in miles and enjoy perks.</p>",
