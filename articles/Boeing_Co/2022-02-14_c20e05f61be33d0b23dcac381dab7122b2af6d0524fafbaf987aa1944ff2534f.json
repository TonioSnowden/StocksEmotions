  "text": "<p>Tensions over Ukraine have been building for months. The U.S. over the weekend ordered most embassy staff to depart Ukraine after warning that a Russian military invasion could be imminent. Moscow also began withdrawing its diplomatic presence. Washington warned last week that Russia could launch a massive military operation against Ukraine in the coming days, but Moscow denies it intends to invade its neighbor.</p><p>SkyUp Airlines said that the owners of the aircraft that it leases have been told by insurers that the planes won't be covered if they enter Ukraine. \"This decision is associated with increased risks of military invasion,\" the airline said. The decision forced SkyUp to land a plane traveling from the Portuguese island of Madeira to Kyiv instead in the Moldovan capital of Chisinau Saturday evening. The Boeing 737 landed at 9:04 p.m., according to data on Flight Tracker, and the airline said it has transferred the 175 passengers to Kyiv overland.</p><p>KLM and other major airlines, such as Germany's Deutsche LufthansaAG, started rescheduling flights to Ukraine last month to avoid crews having to stay in the capital overnight. Insurers have the right to declare force majeure in the event of a military conflict, freeing them from obligations to cover aircraft that are hit during hostilities or are stuck because runways or traffic control are disabled.</p><p>\"In case of war, nobody will cover these risks,\" said Vladyslav Kryklii, a former minister of infrastructure of Ukraine. SkyUp said it was suspending sales from Feb. 14 until Feb. 16, when it said it hoped some agreement could be reached with the government and insurers.</p><p>The Ukrainian government met Sunday to discuss the possibility of extending guarantees to insurance agencies to keep flights going, Mr. Kryklii said.</p><p>Air traffic over Ukraine became a sensitive issue for European airlines after a flight originating from Amsterdam and bound for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, was downed over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 crew and passengers.</p><p>---</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p>",
