  "text": "<p>The other will manage launch activities and operations in space, including the International Space Station, as well as commercial activities in orbit relatively close to Earth, according to the agency.</p><p>The reorganization is \"about helping us as we set the stage for the next 20 years and we are defining NASA's future in a growing space economy,\" agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.</p><p>NASA's role for some space-related activity has been shifting. The agency has sought to foster a broader commercial-space sector it can tap into, and investors and entrepreneurs have been making bets on more business opportunities beyond Earth.</p><p>Instead of producing its own replacement for the now-retired space shuttle, the agency has used rockets from Northrop Grumman Corp. and Elon Musk's SpaceX to resupply the International Space Station with cargo. SpaceX has flown astronauts to and from the space station.</p><p>The agency is also looking to the private sector to develop destinations in orbit that would replace the space station, drawing interest from companies like Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC, among other space enterprises, according to a document NASA posted to a website about that effort.</p><p>Separately, at a hearing before a House subcommittee focused on space on Tuesday, Robyn Gatens, NASA's director for the International Space Station, said the agency believes it could save more than $1 billion annually by purchasing services from private space facilities. The agency currently spends up to $4 billion each year on the research station, officials have said.</p><p>\"Those savings are important because we can apply those savings to expand our exploration efforts\" to the moon, Mars and elsewhere, Ms. Gatens said at the hearing.</p><p>The agency is now starting to prepare for the transition out of the space station, which is expected to be structurally sound until 2028, she said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
