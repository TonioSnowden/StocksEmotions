  "title": "Southwest Airlines Expects Strong Demand, Raises Concerns About Jet Shortages; Airline still expects to receive Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets this year, but said timing of next year's deliveries is uncertain",
  "text": "<p>Southwest on Thursday reported net income of $277 million, or 44 cents a share, on record third-quarter operating revenue of $6.2 billion for the period ended Sept. 30. Southwest's adjusted profit of 50 cents a share exceeded the 47 cents analysts were expecting, according to FactSet.</p><p>Airlines have shaken off concerns about an economic slowdown, with executives saying that the robust bookings they saw over the summer have continued into the fall.</p><p>\"While there is noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not, or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends,\" Southwest Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan said Thursday.</p><p>Travelers have so far been willing to absorb higher fares, helping airlines recoup their own rising costs for fuel and labor. Airline executives say that shifts such as hybrid work arrangements that give people more flexibility are in some cases driving them to travel even more than they did before the pandemic.</p><p>Southwest said leisure demand and last-minute bookings in September more than offset the $18 million hit from disruptions caused by Hurricane Ian at the end of that month.</p><p>Business travel picked up after Labor Day, and strong bookings are coming in for the winter holidays, Mr. Jordan said. The airline said it expects operating revenue to be up 13% to 17% from 2019 levels in the final three months of the year.</p><p>Southwest shares rose 3.6% to $35.61 Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Slow arrivals of new jets and labor shortfalls throughout the industry will likely act as a check on airlines' growth ambitions well into 2023, executives have said.</p><p>Southwest still expects to receive 66 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets this year—a figure that it reduced over the summer—but said it faces uncertainty around the timing of future deliveries, and is working to plan a schedule for next year that won't require last-minute changes. The airline said it expects its network will be fully restored to prepandemic levels by the end of next year.</p><p>Both Boeing and rival Airbus SE are behind in handing over new single-aisle jets that airlines rely on for domestic flights and other short-haul trips, as the manufacturers contend with supply-chain snarls.</p><p>American Airlines Group Inc. last week said it now expects to take delivery of 19 MAX jets next year, down from the 27 it previously expected. JetBlue Airways Corp. this week said it is planning to get deliveries of 22 Airbus jets next year, down from the 29 it was supposed to receive.</p><p>Southwest is also waiting on a new version of the 737, the shorter MAX 7. That plane faces a year-end legal deadline to win certification by U.S. air-safety regulators. Without a congressional extension of that deadline, federal law may require Boeing to make costly and time-consuming overhauls to the airplane's cockpit. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said Wednesday he was confident Congress would grant Boeing an extension.</p><p>The industry is also working through staffing challenges. Airlines have raced to hire tens of thousands of new employees to replace those who left during the pandemic.</p><p>Now carriers have seen logjams in training—particularly for pilots—that have slowed them down. Southwest said it remains on track to hit its goal of hiring more than 10,000 new employees this year, but said pilot-staffing constraints will likely persist through most of next year. Mr. Jordan said Southwest's flying capacity would be 5% to 8% higher if it had enough pilots to fly the planes that it has.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>Southwest Airlines Expects Strong Demand, Raises Concerns About Jet Shortages</p>",
