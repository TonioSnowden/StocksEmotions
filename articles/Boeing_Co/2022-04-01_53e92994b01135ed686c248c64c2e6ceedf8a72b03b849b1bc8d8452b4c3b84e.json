  "text": "<p>\n  FRANCE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Macron Under Fire </p><p>\n  Over Consultants </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Scrutiny of the French government's spending on private consultants during the vaccine rollout has thrown President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive as his bid for re-election approaches its final week. </p><p>\n  The French Senate released a report in March detailing how the government spent 893.9 million euros, equivalent to $993 million, last year on consultants, including McKinsey &amp; Co., to help French officials navigate the pandemic and other challenges. That was a sizable increase on the 379.1 million euros spent in 2018, Mr. Macron's first full year in power, the report said. </p><p>\n  The outlays have stirred criticism in a country that is accustomed to having an army of civil servants manage state affairs. The uproar was compounded on March 25 when the Senate committee that produced the report issued an additional statement alleging that McKinsey, which is based in New York, hasn't paid corporate tax in France for at least a decade, despite making 329 million euros in revenue in the country in 2020 and employing some 600 people. </p><p>\n  Mr. Macron told French TV there was nothing improper about the consulting-firm contracts, adding that he had fought since the start of his term to make sure companies that operate and make profit in France pay taxes. French authorities opened an investigation into McKinsey's tax situation in December, before the Senate's report was published. </p><p>\n  -- Nick Kostov </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  TURKEY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Khashoggi Murder </p><p>\n  Trial Transfer Sought </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Turkish prosecutor in the case against 26 Saudi nationals charged in the slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi made a surprise request Thursday that their trial in absentia be suspended and the case transferred to Saudi Arabia, raising fears of a possible coverup. </p><p>\n  The panel of judges made no ruling on the prosecutor's request but said a letter would be sent to Turkey's Justice Ministry seeking its opinion on the possible transfer of the file to Saudi judicial authorities, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The trial was adjourned until April 7. </p><p>\n  The development comes as Turkey has been trying to normalize its relationship with Saudi Arabia, which hit a low following Mr. Khashoggi's grisly October 2018 killing. </p><p>\n  Amnesty International urged Turkey to press ahead with the trial, saying if it is transferred to Saudi Arabia, Turkey will be \"willingly sending the case to a place where it will be covered up.\" </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CHINA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Search for Plane </p><p>\n  Wreckage Is at End </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Chinese officials said Thursday that the search for wreckage in last week's crash of a China Eastern Boeing 737-800 is basically done and that more than 49,000 pieces of debris had been found. </p><p>\n  Flight 5735 plunged from 29,000 feet into a mountainside in southern China's Guangxi region, killing all 132 people on board. The impact created a 65-foot-deep crater, set off a fire in the surrounding forest and smashed the plane into small parts scattered over a wide area, some of them buried underground. </p><p>\n  Zhu Tao, the director of aviation safety for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said important parts including the horizontal stabilizer, engine and remains of the right wing tip had been recovered after nearly 10 days of searching, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. </p><p>\n  The two black boxes -- the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- have been found and sent to Beijing for examination and analysis. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
