  "title": "NASA Sets Sights on Moon With High-Stakes Artemis Mission; Crewless test flight is scheduled for Monday as agency ultimately aims to return astronauts to lunar surface",
  "text": "<p>Charles Duke Jr., a former NASA astronaut who spent more than 20 hours on the lunar surface during the 1972 Apollo 16 mission, said the coming launch represents a change for an agency that had become risk-averse.</p><p>\"We're beginning to take some chances again, and to launch this thing all the way out to the moon on the very first mission instead of just doing it in Earth orbit is very, very ambitious,\" Mr. Duke said.</p><p>Liftoff of Artemis I—using the agency's Space Launch System rocket with the Orion spacecraft on top—is set to begin as soon as 8:33 a.m. ET on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center, east of Orlando, Fla.</p><p>Following billions of dollars in investment, cost overruns and delays, the stakes are high for the agency. Dr. Roger Launius, former chief historian at NASA, said a failure could threaten the agency's efforts to return astronauts to the moon. \"It's conceivable that some in the political world could say, 'Look, this is just too costly,'\" he said.</p><p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has been touting the SLS rocket as the most powerful the agency has operated, surpassing the Saturn V rockets used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. Mr. Nelson fought to support the SLS rocket and Orion programs years ago while representing Florida in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Photos: A Preview of NASA's Artemis I Moon Mission</p><p>In an interview, he compared Artemis I, which is expected to cost $4.1 billion in production and launch-operations expenses, with other agency missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope development and deployment. The $10 billion space telescope was nearly a decade late and billions over budget before NASA successfully had it launched in December. It recently completed a complicated monthslong deployment and has captured dazzling deep-space images and data.</p><p>Mr. Nelson said Artemis I has garnered more attention than other agency efforts because of its connection to human spaceflight, which many people associate with NASA. The test mission doesn't have to go perfectly, he said, because NASA could still learn a great deal even if the agency alters or shortens its duration.</p><p>NASA is determined to meet its testing goals for Artemis I and press on to a future flight with astronauts, Mr. Nelson said. \"If you want to say, is that pressure, it's what the mission's all about,\" he said.</p><p>NASA is likely to spend about $93 billion over more than a dozen years on Artemis, according to a November report from the agency's inspector general, who has called the expected $4.1 billion price tag for each of the four anticipated Artemis missions unsustainable. Mr. Nelson said per-flight costs will come down as NASA spreads development expenses over more missions, and the agency has been scrutinizing contracts to find efficiencies.</p><p>The launch planned for Monday is expected to unfold over several stages. Weather or technical challenges could delay liftoff, and the agency has designated two dates in early September as backups.</p><p>NASA plans to shoot the Orion spacecraft into orbit using its SLS rocket. That vehicle and the boosters connected to its sides are designed to fire for just a few minutes during the first stage of the mission before falling away. After deploying solar arrays and conducting several maneuvers, another propulsion system is meant to give Orion a major push toward the moon at around 90 minutes into the flight.</p><p>The spacecraft is designed to speed along to an orbit of the moon, before its return trip back to Earth.</p><p>A key test is slated to occur upon re-entry, expected around six weeks after launch, when Orion's heat shield will have to withstand temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit as the spacecraft's crew capsule roars back into Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles an hour. Parachutes are designed to slow the capsule for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Officials at NASA have said they plan to push Orion during the mission to get a read on how the vehicle operates before astronauts get on board.</p><p>\"We are stressing Orion beyond what it was actually designed for,\" Robert Cabana, NASA's associate administrator, said Monday. \"We want to make sure that it works absolutely perfectly when we do that, and that we understand all the risks.\"</p><p>NASA plans to use another SLS rocket to launch four astronauts aboard Orion's crew capsule in 2024 on a flight that would orbit the moon but not touch down.</p><p>The following year, the agency plans a return to lunar orbit, where astronauts on board would transfer into a SpaceX lander that would transport two Americans down to the moon's surface.</p><p>Some former NASA officials said Artemis I's ambitious scope poses its own risks.</p><p>\"If this has a problem, are we going to put people on it next time?\" Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator for NASA and longtime critic of SLS and Orion, said of the mission set to begin Monday.</p><p>Artemis's success depends not just on NASA, but also on a group of aerospace contractors overseen by the agency, as well as thousands of other suppliers across the country.</p><p>Boeing Co. served as the main contractor for the core of the rocket—the huge circular tank that will feed propellant to four Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. engines that NASA is reusing from its Space Shuttle program, which ended more than a decade ago. Northrop Grumman Corp. built the missile-shaped boosters strapped to the rocket's sides, and Lockheed Martin Corp. serves as the prime developer of Orion.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think is the future of lunar exploration? Join the conversation below.</p><p>All of the main contractors have struggled at times with technical problems and delays, according to a series of reports from NASA's inspector general. Executives at Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop have said they have taken steps to improve performance. Aerojet said it also has moved to streamline production.</p><p>NASA was directed to pursue the SLS and Orion programs in 2010, when Congress passed legislation mandating that the agency pursue the vehicles.</p><p>Kay Bailey Hutchison, who supported that law while representing Texas in the Senate, said in a recent interview that backers of the bill were \"threading the needle\" between those who wanted the private sector to take over spaceflight completely and those who wanted NASA to oversee all such efforts.</p><p>Mr. Nelson, the NASA administrator, has said the Artemis launch will allow NASA to learn a great deal as it looks to pursue bigger projects, including future missions to Mars.</p><p>\"I want to underscore: This is a test flight,\" he said recently. \"It's just the beginning.\"</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com and Aylin Woodward at aylin.woodward@wsj.com</p><p>NASA Sets Sights on Moon With High-Stakes Artemis Mission</p>",
