  "title": "Obituaries: Top Airbus Executive Put Heat on Boeing",
  "text": "<p>Jean Pierson, who served as chief executive of Airbus from 1985 to 1998, proved a star salesman for the European airplane maker as it began catching up with Boeing Co. in a global market once dominated by American manufacturers.</p><p>The Frenchman, who died Wednesday at the age of 80, tended to be less formal than his rivals at Boeing. In 1997, he personally negotiated a large sale of airplanes to US Airways, recalled Stephen Wolf, then CEO of the American carrier. When Mr. Wolf pressed for last-minute pricing concessions, Mr. Pierson unbuckled his belt and let his trousers fall to his ankles to signal he had nothing more to give. Mr. Wolf, who was amused and believed he already had a bargain, stopped negotiating and signed a contract.</p><p>Robert Alizart, a former spokesman for Mr. Pierson, confirmed the trousers story.</p><p>By the time Mr. Pierson retired in 1998, Airbus was a strong No. 2 behind Boeing, which had swallowed up the other major player, McDonnell Douglas Corp. \"We are not in this business to be a niche player,\" Mr. Pierson said at a press conference. \"We want to be 50-50, which is in fact a polite version to one day being No. 1.\"</p><p>By 2003, Airbus was consistently delivering more jetliners than Boeing. Last year, Airbus delivered more than three times as many jets as Boeing, hobbled by the grounding of its 737 MAX jet.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
