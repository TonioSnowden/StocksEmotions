  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Boeing Resumes Dreamliner Deliveries",
  "text": "<p>The plane maker had halted deliveries of the popular jets in October after a series of production quality lapses. The problems have prompted stepped-up regulatory scrutiny and hindered Boeing's ability to generate cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hurt demand for air travel and the airplanes it produces.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the pace of deliveries for the company's backlog of Dreamliners, which it has moved to produce at a rate of five airplanes a month. Since halting deliveries in October, Boeing has built up an inventory of more than 80 finished planes, according to aviation data provider Ascend by Cirium.</p><p>The Boeing spokesman said the company thoroughly examined many aspects of the 787 program to ensure newly delivered airplanes \"meet all regulatory requirements and Boeing's highest quality standards.\"</p><p>The Dreamliner production lapses spurred a broad review by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>",
