  "title": "Biden Reverses Trump Plan to Paint Air Force One Red, White and Blue; Color scheme would have required more engineering and boosted costs for the new presidential planes, says administration official",
  "text": "<p>Pentagon officials had determined that the dark blue in Mr. Trump's preferred color scheme would cause certain electronic components on the new aircraft to overheat, according to the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>\"The paint scheme in question was one of many possible livery colors proposed,\" the Air Force said. \"Further analysis concluded darker colors, among other factors, on the underside of the VC-25B aircraft might contribute to temperatures exceeding the current qualification limits of a small number of components.\"</p><p>The two new U.S. presidential jets are Boeing Co. 747-8 commercial aircraft that will be known as VC-25B military variants.</p><p>While he was in office, Mr. Trump frequently talked about his desire to redesign the look of the iconic plane, which has been painted the same light blue and white since the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s. Mr. Trump keeps a model of the redesigned plane on a coffee table at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p><p>Mr. Trump's spokesman, Taylor Budowich, accused Mr. Biden of \"embracing a socialist vision for America\" and added, \"it's no surprise he wants to remove the beautiful red, white and blue design for Air Force One.\"</p><p>U.S. presidents use the Air Force-operated planes for both domestic and international travel, often opting for a smaller version of the aircraft when traveling shorter distances or when landing at regional airports. The larger planes are used for foreign trips and travel to larger U.S. airports. The planes are equipped with workspace, as well as a bedroom for the president.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman said the company was making steady progress on developing the new planes despite challenges. \"It's an honor to be entrusted with this responsibility and we take particular pride in this work,\" he said. \"Our focus is on delivering two exceptional Air Force One airplanes for the country.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump struck a $3.9 billion deal with Boeing in 2018 to develop replacements for the current aging jumbo jets known as Air Force Once when the commander in chief is on board. Recently, Pentagon officials have said they expect the new jets to arrive two to three years later than their expected 2024 delivery.</p><p>Boeing has recently faced production problems with the new jet, including delays related to a key supplier and the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, factory crews risked damaging one of the new jet's wings while attempting to shift its weight onto jacks. Pentagon officials have said there was no damage to the aircraft. Boeing has said it holds its employees accountable to make sure they meet stringent quality-control requirements.</p><p>Last year, two empty mini tequila bottles were found on the aircraft. Boeing has said that the incident was a personnel matter and that it was working to improve quality and manufacturing operations.</p><p>Alex Leary contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Reverses Trump Plan to Paint Air Force One Red, White and Blue</p>",
