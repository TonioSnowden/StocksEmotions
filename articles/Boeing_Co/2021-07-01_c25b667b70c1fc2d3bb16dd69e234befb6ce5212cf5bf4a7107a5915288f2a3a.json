  "title": "Business News:  Boeing to Tap GE Veteran as CFO  ----  By Andrew Tangel",
  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. is expected to name Brian West, a veteran of engine maker General Electric Co., as its next chief financial officer, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Mr. West would succeed Greg Smith, the plane maker's current CFO who is set to retire in July after serving as finance chief for a decade. Investors and current and former Boeing executives considered Mr. Smith to be a steady hand through the company's recent crises, including the pandemic which decimated demand for new aircraft, and his successor was considered a key appointment. </p><p>   Mr. West previously worked at Nielsen Holdings NV when Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun was the CEO there. He also served in GE's aviation division, which Mr. Calhoun previously ran. </p><p>   Boeing's leadership and board have faced several shake-ups in the past two years. </p><p>   Additionally, Boeing appointed to its board Stayce Harris, a former pilot for United Airlines Holdings Inc., in a move that will bring piloting and more military experience to the plane maker's oversight of management. </p><p>   Ms. Harris, who flew various Boeing jets during her nearly three decades at United, is also a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, Boeing said. Her appointment comes as Boeing faces problems with defense aircraft, including its military refueling tanker and replacement Air Force One jets used by the U.S. president. </p><p>   As a Black woman, she also adds to the board's diversity. Companies across industries are being called upon to diversify their boards, and Boeing has recently added women and people of color to its board. </p><p>   The company's directors have included retired Navy officials, but no pilots or former Air Force officials in recent years. </p><p>   Ms. Harris has worked closely with Boeing's commercial and military aircraft throughout her career, the company said. At the Defense Department, she most recently served as inspector general of the Air Force. </p><p>   Boeing's board has faced criticism from shareholders, proxy-advisory firms and lawmakers regarding its oversight of management after two 737 MAX crashes in late 2018 and early 2019. The accidents, which took 346 lives, led Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to bolster their focus on how pilots interact with automated cockpit systems. </p><p>   After the MAX crashes, the company split the roles of chief executive and chairman. Seven directors on the board when the second MAX jet crashed have since left. </p><p></p>",
