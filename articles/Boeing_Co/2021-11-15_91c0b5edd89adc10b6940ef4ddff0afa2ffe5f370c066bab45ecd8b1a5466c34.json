  "title": "Airbus Wins First Order for New Freighter as Air Cargo Booms; Order from Air Lease for seven cargo variants of A350 marks Airbus's push into market long dominated by Boeing",
  "text": "<p>Shipments of medical supplies and personal protective gear gave cargo an early-pandemic boost, bolstered by a lockdown-fed boom in e-commerce. More recently, manufacturers around the world have turned increasingly to airfreight to bypass snarled ports, packed ships and trucking shortages that have delayed cheaper cargo delivery by land and sea.</p><p>Two of the world's largest container shipping companies, A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S and CMA CGM SA, have ordered new Boeing 777 freighter jets this year, citing the need to have air-cargo options for customers.</p><p>Airlines, too, have turned increasingly to cargo as a lifeline during the pandemic. Many have retooled their passenger planes, and their schedules, to allow for more airfreight to make up for less passenger traffic. Some have said they won't give up cargo even when passengers return to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Almost three-quarters of passenger-focused airlines expect their air cargo volumes to continue rising over the next year from already-elevated levels, according to a recent poll by the International Air Transport Association. The trade group said global cargo traffic in September was up 9.1% from the same month in 2019.</p><p>Airbus said at the Dubai Air Show on Monday that the freighter order came from rental giant Air Lease Corp. with deliveries set to start in 2026. The deal was part of a larger order for 111 aircraft across Airbus's product line, including 100 narrow-bodies and four A330neo wide-bodies. The leasing firm has a history of being the first to snare new Airbus models.</p><p>\"We're responding to the invitation for competition in the market,\" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said at a press conference. \"It's not so much a matter of breaking-in, or stealing the bacon from somebody else. It is a matter of responding to the call from the market, and not just from one or two players, but many.\"</p><p>The addition of the A350F, as it will be designated, comes as Boeing prepares its next move in the freighter market. The U.S. manufacturer has long dominated the segment with cargo versions of its 767, now widely used by Amazon.com Inc., and 777 wide-bodies.</p><p>It also still makes a freighter version of its four-engine 747 double-decker, but production is due to end next year. The freighter market has generated more than a third of Boeing's wide-body orders since 2019.</p><p>The collapse of many long-haul air travel markets has idled dozens of larger aircraft such as the Airbus A330 and Boeing's 777. Many are being converted for use as freighters. Boeing, which has its own in-house conversion operation, announced this weekend that it plans to convert planes at three new sites. It has orders to convert more than 400 jets.</p><p>Boeing's head of commercial-aircraft sales, Ihssane Mounir, said on Saturday that the company was in advanced talks with customers over a cargo version of its newest aircraft, a revamped version of the 777, dubbed the 777X.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com</p><p>Airbus Wins First Order for New Freighter as Air Cargo Booms</p>",
