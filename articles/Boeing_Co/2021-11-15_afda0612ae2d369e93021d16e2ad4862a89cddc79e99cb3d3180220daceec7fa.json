  "text": "<p>Airbus has secured its first commitment for a new freighter version of its popular A350 aircraft, as the European plane maker seeks to challenge US rival Boeing's dominance of the booming cargo market. </p> <p>Under an agreement unveiled at the Dubai air show on Monday, US lessor Air Lease said it had placed a preliminary order for seven wide-body A350 freighter aircraft. </p> <p>The package includes commitments for a range of other planes, including 55 single-aisle A321neos and 20 of the longer-range A321XLR as the European group looks to take on Boeing, which has long dominated the new-build wide-body freighter market. The US company says it provides more than 90 per cent of worldwide dedicated freighter capacity.</p> <p>The Airbus order, although preliminary, underpins the company's plans to launch a freighter version of its wide-body A350, first announced in July. </p> <p>Boeing, meanwhile, is expected to launch a competing freighter version of its 777X jet in the coming months. </p> <p>Both companies are seeking to capitalise on a surge in cargo traffic during the pandemic as consumers turned online. Freighter traffic increased as passenger aircraft that typically carry 50 per cent of airborne goods were grounded during the crisis. </p> <p>Cargo-only airlines picked up much of the slack where they could, while many airlines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c84351be-bf98-4831-9e7f-428f9c01f06b\">converted their jets</a> into makeshift freighter planes or brought back retired aircraft to cope with the soaring demand for personal protection equipment. </p> <p>Air cargo volumes hit an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a437020-cbde-4244-bcae-60f64f0016e2\">all-time high in March this year</a> as the global economy recovered. Shipping delays have only added to the surge in demand. </p> <p>In September, cargo tonne-kilometres, a measure of freight traffic, <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2021-releases/2021-11-03-01/\">were up 9.4 per cent compared with the same month in 2019</a>, according to numbers from the International Air Transport Association. </p> <p>Soaring shipping prices have also made air travel look more affordable. In September, the average price to move air cargo was three times more than by sea, down from 12.5 times before the pandemic.</p> <p>The order “signals we're moving beyond the Covid doldrums” said Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer. Air Lease's endorsement for the A350 freighter “confirms the global enthusiasm we see for this quantum leap in the freighter space”.</p> <p>Boeing also announced new freighter orders over the weekend. Shipper DHL ordered nine 767-300 converted freighters on Sunday, and Emirates ordered two 777 freighters. The Chicago company said it had received 38 orders for its best-selling 777 freighter this year, “tied to sustained demand for air cargo”.</p> <p>Airbus said at the weekend that it expected <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-airbus-foresees-demand-for-39000-new-passenger-freighter-aircraft\">industry growth </a>to be driven, in part by the soaring demand for air cargo. It forecast a need for about 2,440 freighters over the next 20 years, of which 880 will be new-build. </p> <p>Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said the A350 freighter was a “nice-to-have for Airbus” rather than a “must-have game changer”.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“The new freighter market is pretty small versus the passenger markets, but it's never good to have a category where your competitor has a monopoly — they can use super normal profits in that area to subsidise more competitive parts of the portfolio,” he added. </p>&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer and Philip Georgiadis in London and Claire Bushey in Chicago 2021 'Airbus secures first commitment to freighter version of A350 jet' FT.com 15 November.
