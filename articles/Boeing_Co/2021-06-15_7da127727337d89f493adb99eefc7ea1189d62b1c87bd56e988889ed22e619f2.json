The plan, announced on Tuesday, is part of a $12bn investment in recruitment, training, technology and deals designed to capture a booming market for environmental, social and governance advice.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>2. JPMorgan foresees investment banking boom</strong> Jamie Dimon on Monday predicted JPMorgan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ecf1a70-c309-4a09-bb6b-982f25dadc08\">is on track</a> for one of its strongest quarters for dealmaking fees. The bank's chief executive said the current quarter could be one of the best “we've ever seen” for investment banking. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffd6033f-e8fc-4289-85b2-42bc4ddddd16\">speaking at the same conference as Dimon</a>, had a tough message for his staff: “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office and we want you in the office.”</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Third Point builds stake in Vivendi</strong> The New York-based hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb has built <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a7df40-68b4-4041-b2a5-98b967af4e07\">a “substantial” stake</a> in Vivendi, the media group controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré. The investment comes as Vivendi&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ca220cd-d516-4ad7-a73c-748f6de025d2\">hashes out a deal to sell a stake</a>&#xa0;in Universal Music to Bill Ackman's blank-cheque company. It is unclear whether Loeb supports the deal or not, but if he does not it would pit the two titans of the investing world against each other.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>4. Hedge funds target 7% of assets in crypto in 5 years </strong>Hedge funds plan to significantly <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/4f8044bf-8f0f-46b4-9fb7-6d0eba723017\">increase exposure to cryptocurrencies</a> by 2026, a survey of 100 chief financial officers found, in a vote of confidence for digital assets despite recent price falls and plans for punitive capital rules.</p> <p><strong>5. UK and Australia agree post-Brexit trade deal </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e74fd99a-aa89-4cd8-a759-9ccc25f8ca27\">trade deal</a> is expected to become a model for Britain's post-Brexit commercial policy and pave the way for the UK to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. If the trade deal can be signed before the end of the year, it would mark the first big bilateral agreement entirely negotiated by the UK since it left the EU in January 2020.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Emirates</strong> has posted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59c1bc53-c200-4ab5-9292-86e7a7a29fce\">an annual loss of $5.5bn</a> as the coronavirus pandemic forced the&#xa0;airline to slash its workforce and turn to its Dubai government shareholder for support.</p></li>  <li><p>Governments should use a <strong>‘portfolio of vaccines'</strong> to <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/b79b24fb-90bb-4720-98f2-d72fe21d342b\">end the pandemic</a>, the head of the EU's medicines agency told the FT.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d00de1a-92d7-4b63-a151-53a6ae064368\">delayed a full opening of the UK economy</a> by four weeks.

(AP)</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Biden, Putin and the information warfare era </strong>As Joe Biden prepares to meet Vladimir Putin in Geneva tomorrow, efforts by Russia-linked groups to discredit Covid-19 vaccines are part of what the US sees as an <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/51fc3b07-78a5-4461-823c-c9d22baeb063\">intensified disinformation campaign</a>. But few believe Moscow is likely to back off its cyber activities.</p> <p><strong>How the wealthiest Americans get away with paying no tax</strong> The US has long had two tax systems: one for people who work for a living, and another for the wealthy. Because the US only taxes capital gains upon the sale of an asset, wealthy individuals are able to accumulate vast fortunes completely untaxed until they decide to cash out, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6edf7c7-c3ed-4db4-ade1-77e3761795a6\">says former BlackRock executive Morris Pearl</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can racial equality be built into the US cannabis industry?</strong> When Illinois legalised recreational cannabis in January 2020 it wanted to make sure that African Americans and Hispanics, groups that suffered more from the war on drugs than white people, benefited disproportionately from the legalisation. But despite promising to give “social equity applicants” an advantage in winning licences, Illinois still has no majority black-owned cannabis dispensaries, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/449ee58c-f235-42fd-9f76-bc56dcb1544a\">writes Patti Waldmier</a>. </p> <p><strong>Who is Peru's president in waiting?</strong> With his huge straw hat and giant yellow pencil, Pedro Castillo has emerged from nowhere to become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de9cdc65-9c45-4570-9d40-f2e533820bd1\">one of the most recognisable figures</a> in Latin American politics. He is poised to become Peru's next president. But what will he do in government? No one knows.</p> <p><strong>France's prodigal striker draws far-right fury </strong>Far-right fans have cast centre-forward <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/efa4a617-ba46-491c-97a6-3bdb3793a308\">Karim Benzema</a> as the personification of the <em>banlieues</em>: of Algerian origin, the millionaire Real Madrid star grew up in one such poor, immigrant suburb of Lyon. His involvement in a “sextape” scandal in 2015 made him the target of racist attacks.</p> <h1>House &amp; Home</h1> <p><strong>Five homes for football fans </strong>From a sprawling home in Portugal with its own pitch to a Roman apartment near Stadio Olimpico, check out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efc79b02-36e1-4bb5-81f4-350ae2488a47\">these listings</a>.
