  "text": "<p>What are stock benchmarks doing?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA shed 202 points, or 0.6%, to 36,592, after turning negative in afternoon trade.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 57 points, or 1.1%, to 4,739.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP tumbled 370 points, or 2.4%, to 15,249.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow rose 215 points, or 0.6%, to close at a record 36,800, while the S&amp;P 500 fell less than 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks slumped further and the Dow skidded into negative territory after the release of minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December revealed a more hawkish tone by Fed officials grappling with taming what some have described as 1980s-like levels of inflation.</p><p>Minutes revealed robust talk among some Fed officials around the central bank potentially moving to raise rates quicker and cutting its current $8.8 trillion sized balance sheet quicker than earlier anticipated to help tackle higher costs of living.</p><p>Read: Fed officials rate hikes coming faster or sooner than they had thought</p><p>The talk of faster-paced steps toward policy normalization surprised Wall Street, with John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management,&#xa0;calling the statement and presser “a big shift with accelerated taper and plans for three hikes in 2022,” in emailed comments.</p><p>At the Dec. 14-15 meeting, Fed policy makers agreed to speed the wind-down of the central bank's monthly asset purchases.</p><p>The shifting tone hastened a wreck in technology-related sectors XX:SP500.45 already gathering momentum on Wednesday, with a second loss in store for the first three session of 2022. A rise in government bond yields also was contributing to pressure on tech plays, as investors factor in the prospect of higher borrowing costs if the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates as many as the three times as anticipated this year.</p><p>On the other hand, financials XX:SP500.40, which benefit from a rising rate environment, were headed solidly higher on the day and week.</p><p>The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y has surged well over 17 points in the first two trading days of 2021.</p><p>Investors earlier in the session were boosting value stocks in the financial and industrial sectors, while shunning technology plays.</p><p>“I think may investors are coming to the realization that this is not the time to stick your neck out,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, in a phone interview.</p><p>He pointed to the “repricing of higher valuation stocks” in recent days and continued selling Wednesday in the technology sector. “At some point, though, I think tech investors will be going in to defend some of these names, but we are not at that point yet,” he said.</p><p>The omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a disease also has pushed much of the world into an uncertain phase of the pandemic, even if evidence suggests the illnesses caused by the new strain are milder than other variants.</p><p>On the economic and policy fronts, a report on private payrolls showed that 807,000 jobs were created in December, according to the ADP National Employment Report, higher than forecast for a gain of 375,000, based on average estimates from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>“Jobs, jobs, jobs. Today through Friday, Wall Street will be obsessed with jobs reports and their likely influence of inflation and interest rates,” wrote Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in emailed comments.</p><p>Strategists use the ADP report to get an early read on the Labor Department's report on private payrolls, which are scheduled to be released in about 48 hours. The private-sector report recently hasn't been an accurate predictor of the Friday jobs report.</p><p>However, the ADP report is watched because investors will be more attuned to the health of the jobs market during the omicron variant surge.</p><p>The labor market and the outlook for inflation also are two factors that policy makers at the Fed will be observing closely as they set up for the new year.</p><p>Separately, the final reading of the IHS Markit services purchasing managers index for December came in at 57.6, down from 58 in November but mostly in line from an earlier estimate.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>The highflying automotive sector also will be in the spotlight, after rallies for Tesla TSLA and Ford Motor Co. F on successive days. General MotorsGM is set to release an all-electric Chevy Silverado on Wednesday, while SonySONY rallied in Tokyo trade after setting up an electric vehicle unit. Shares of GM were down 3%, Ford was off 0.1% after a big run-up on Tuesday and Tesla's stock was 2.4% lower.</p><p>Shares of Beyond MeatBYND&#xa0;were in focus after said its plant-based fried chicken product is coming to KFC locations in the U.S. next week. Its stock was down 1.9%.</p><p>Boeing Co. shares BA rose 0.3% as the airline industry ordered the aeronautics company's 737 MAX jet. On Wednesday, the&#xa0;Allegiant Travel ALGT airline, Allegiant Air, ordered 50 MAX jets with an option to purchase 50 more.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;rose 4 basis point to 1.70%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY was off 0.2%.</p><p>Gold futures&#xa0;GC00 closed higher, with the February contract rising 0.6% to settle at $1,825.10 an ounce on Comex, but retreating after the Fed minutes.&#xa0;West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery&#xa0;CLG22,&#xa0;the U.S. benchmark, rose 0.7%, to reach $77.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>Bitcoin&#xa0;BTCUSD&#xa0;fell 1.6%.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600&#xa0;SXXP index closed up less than 0.1%, while London's FTSE 100&#xa0;UKX ended its session up 0.2%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite&#xa0;SHCOMP declined 1% and China's CSI 300 XX:000300 fell 1%, while the Hang Seng Index&#xa0;HSI declined 1.6% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225&#xa0;NIK edged up 0.1%.</p><p>—Steve Goldstein contributed to this article</p>",
