  "title": "Business News: Suppliers Feel Boeing's Jet Pain",
  "text": "<p>The reduced production has choked the global supply chain for the aircraft, denting sales of parts and components sold by suppliers like Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Hexcel Corp. Analysts estimate Boeing has more than 100 new 787s awaiting delivery while it seeks regulatory approval for proposed inspections before handing the jets over to customers.</p><p>Boeing suppliers are looking for further guidance on the company's plan to resume deliveries and boost production, which could come with its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We are not shipping anything today on 787,\" said Raytheon Chief Executive Greg Hayes on an investor call Tuesday. Raytheon supplies around $10 million in parts and equipment, such as cockpit systems, for each of the wide-body jets.</p><p>The Dreamliner is built largely from carbon fiber composite rather than aluminum to save weight and improve fuel efficiency, with a global supply chain flying parts to Boeing's assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., from partners in Japan, Italy and throughout the U.S.</p><p>Albany International Corp., which specializes in composite materials, this week flagged low 787 Boeing production, saying it expected about $10 million in revenue from the program this year compared with $50 million in 2019. Albany executives said Boeing held substantial stocks of its material in its inventory.</p><p>\"Boeing's low level of production will likely lead to very low levels of production for us for the foreseeable future and may even lead to significant production gaps,\" Albany finance chief Stephen Nolan said.</p><p>Carbon-fiber supplier Hexcel said on its earnings call last week that reduced 787 production reduced its revenue in the company's most recent quarter.</p><p>Boeing is increasingly expected to resume 787 deliveries early next year, later than previously anticipated, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman said the manufacturer was coordinating with suppliers and customers while it works through comprehensive inspections and reviews. He said the company \"will continue to take the time necessary to meet the highest standards.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
