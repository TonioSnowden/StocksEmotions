  "title": "Artemis I Launch: Why NASA Called It Off, and When It Will Try to Launch Again; Flight had been expected to take uncrewed spacecraft into lunar orbit; next launch attempt could be Friday",
  "text": "<p>The launch will serve as a practice run for a big rocket—a very, very big rocket—called the Space Launch System, and the spacecraft that sits on top, named Orion. The SLS rocket is designed to roar off a Florida launchpad and send Orion zipping toward an orbit around the moon and far beyond it. Orion is slated to begin the journey back to Earth and splash down into the Pacific Ocean under parachutes in October, about six weeks after liftoff.</p><p>A successful mission would help set the stage for a similar flight as early as 2025 that is meant to deliver astronauts to the moon's surface for the first time since 1972. NASA has said it would include a woman and a person of color in that effort—both firsts for the agency.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the postponed launch and moon mission.</p><p>Why was the Artemis I launch called off?</p><p>NASA postponed Monday's launch after failing to resolve problems with one of the four main engines on the SLS rocket. Liftoff had been expected between 8:33 a.m. and 10:33 a.m. ET Monday, but the mission was scrubbed at 8:34 a.m. The countdown was stopped at T-minus-40 minutes.</p><p>Another attempt is expected as soon as Friday.</p><p>The launch team was unable to get to a temperature range on one of the four engines needed to attempt liftoff within the two-hour launch window, NASA said. The RS-25 engines made by Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. were repurposed from use on previous space shuttle missions.</p><p>\"Engineers are continuing to gather additional data,\" NASA said.</p><p>Where does Artemis I launch from?</p><p>Liftoff is expected to happen from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA has upgraded the pad, which was used for Apollo missions to the moon decades ago and Space Shuttle flights to low-Earth orbit more recently.</p><p>How can I watch the Artemis I launch?</p><p>NASA's online broadcast site is streaming the launch.</p><p>What will happen during the Artemis I mission?</p><p>After the Orion spacecraft is blasted into Earth's orbit using the 322-foot-tall SLS rocket—NASA's most powerful rocket ever, with four main engines and two boosters—the boosters are expected to use up their fuel and fall away after about two minutes. The engines on the main part of the SLS will burn for eight minutes in all.</p><p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Saturn V, the rocket used to send astronauts to the moon aboard the Apollo spacecraft decades ago, generated 7.6 million pounds of thrust.</p><p>\"This baby's going to be 8.8\" million pounds, he said, referring to the SLS rocket.</p><p>After the SLS boosters, main stage and other hardware are jettisoned, Orion will travel toward the moon over the next eight to 14 days. Then the vehicle will enter into a lunar orbit, where it will spend between six and 19 days, before heading back to Earth.</p><p>Before it re-enters Earth's atmosphere, the part of the spacecraft designed to carry crew members will separate from the rest of Orion. The crew capsule then will encounter temperatures of close to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it hits a re-entry speed of around 25,000 miles an hour.</p><p>Parachutes will deploy to slow the capsule before it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean, close to a U.S. Navy recovery ship stationed near San Diego. If the Aug. 29 launch is successful, this splashdown will take place around Oct. 10.</p><p>Why is it called Artemis?</p><p>The Artemis program takes its name from the Greek goddess of the moon. Artemis is also the twin sister of the Greek god of the sun, Apollo—the namesake of NASA's lunar program that first landed astronauts on the moon more than 50 years ago.</p><p>What is the goal of the Artemis I mission?</p><p>NASA's main objectives include testing how the Orion spacecraft, its heat shield and other systems operate while blasting off from Earth, into the unforgiving environment of space and returning to the planet. The launch will gauge whether all that technology can eventually safely transport astronauts to the moon and back. It will also test the SLS rocket as well as the systems that support launch and re-entry.</p><p>\"This test flight will be one that provides us a tremendous amount of data, and I expect we're going to learn a lot,\" said John Honeycutt, Space Launch System program manager at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.</p><p>Will Artemis I carry astronauts?</p><p>No. Artemis I is an uncrewed test flight, and will be controlled from Earth. Instead of people, this flight will have a manikin called \"Commander Moonikin Campos\" strapped into the commander's seat. That astronaut stand-in will be wearing a special suit equipped with sensors to measure radiation levels.</p><p>Two other manikin torsos, called Helga and Zohar, will also be on board, wearing vests designed to lower radiation exposure. NASA has been working to understand and mitigate health risks faced by astronauts when they are exposed to prolonged radiation in space.</p><p>Astronauts are expected to steer future Artemis missions. A second mission, slated for no earlier than 2024, would have them travel to lunar orbit but not land on the moon, while a third and fourth mission would look to put astronauts on the lunar surface as soon as 2025, using a lander designed by Elon Musk's SpaceX.</p><p>Can other rockets be used for missions to the moon?</p><p>Sure, but different missions have different requirements and not every rocket is designed to heft relatively heavy payloads into space.</p><p>NASA has said the SLS rocket is the only existing vehicle capable of blasting Orion, astronauts and cargo to low-Earth orbit—where the spacecraft can continue toward the moon—in a single launch. SpaceX is also working on a rocket with a similar capability, while other launch companies have vehicles that can blast smaller payloads to space.</p><p>Will Artemis I send anything to the lunar surface?</p><p>No, not this time. According to NASA, the Orion spaceship will be about 60 miles above the lunar surface at its closest point.</p><p>However, 10 shoebox-sized satellites called cubesats will be hitching a ride and will be deployed into space during the mission.</p><p>These devices, designed by various universities, companies and agencies, will conduct research. Arizona State University and Kentucky's Morehead State University each designed a cubesat that will search the moon for water. Another cubesat jointly developed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory will use a solar sail to travel to a tiny asteroid and do a flyby of the surface.</p><p>How much will Artemis I cost?</p><p>About $4.1 billion to produce and operate, according to an estimate last year from NASA's inspector general. The subsequent missions, Artemis II, III and IV, will also each cost that amount. Overall, NASA is expected to spend $93 billion on Artemis between the federal government's 2012 and 2025 fiscal years, according to the inspector general.</p><p>NASA and key contractors have said they are taking steps to reduce the Artemis program's costs.</p><p>Yet these costs pale when compared with what the U.S. spent on its space program decades ago, said Teasel Muir-Harmony, historian and curator of the Apollo collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.</p><p>The Planetary Society, an international nonprofit organization that advocates for space exploration, has said NASA's budget peaked in the 1960s as the agency was pushing to beat the Soviet Union to the moon with its Apollo program. For the government's 1964 fiscal year, for example, NASA's budget appropriation adjusted for inflation was about $59 billion, compared with about $23 billion for the 2021 fiscal year, according to the group.</p><p>\"It was the national priority,\" Dr. Muir-Harmony said of the Apollo program.</p><p>Photos: A Preview of NASA's Artemis Moon Mission</p><p>Who is launching and working on Artemis I?</p><p>NASA, of course. But also many of the top U.S. aerospace companies are involved in Artemis, and they have hired thousands of smaller suppliers around the country to contribute to the program.</p><p>Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. worked together to develop various aspects of the SLS rocket.</p><p>Lockheed Martin Corp. led the development of the Orion spacecraft. The European Space Agency, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing, also contributed.</p><p>Are the space vehicles from Artemis I reusable?</p><p>Not really. NASA didn't design the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for reuse, though according to Lockheed Martin, some of the radio communications antennas and transponders and guidance navigation components from Orion will be reused during the Artemis II mission in 2024.</p><p>Still, Orion's capabilities exceed those of the Apollo spacecraft, its predecessor. Orion is built to travel farther, carry more crew and hold additional flight computers with more memory and better operating speeds.</p><p>\"Orion, if you look at it, is like Apollo on steroids,\" said Charles Duke Jr., a former NASA astronaut who walked on the moon in 1972.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com and Aylin Woodward at Aylin.Woodward@wsj.com</p><p>Artemis I Launch: Why NASA Called It Off, and When It Will Try to Launch Again</p>",
