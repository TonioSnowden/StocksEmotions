  "title": "Lawmakers Spar Over Marijuana, Energy Permits in Defense-Bill Talks; Legislation to fund federal government also stalls",
  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think should be given priority in the new NDAA defense bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Congress has passed the bill more than 60 years in a row. As one of the few bipartisan bills likely to be approved before the end of the year, lawmakers often look to the NDAA as a vehicle to pass into law projects and priorities that have nothing to do with the military. This year, some lawmakers want to attach proposals to overhaul energy permitting and enable banks to do business with marijuana companies.</p><p>The NDAA—expected to come in at more than $800 billion—is one of two major initiatives Congress is trying to finish by the end of the year, along with the spending bill that would fund the government.</p><p>The NDAA needs a majority to pass the Democratic-controlled House, which usually passes it on a bipartisan basis. At least 60 votes are needed for it to advance in the evenly split Senate, meaning at least 10 Senate Republicans must vote for it.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) on Tuesday criticized Democrats for trying to include the permitting and marijuana provisions.</p><p>\"We're talking about a grab bag of miscellaneous pet priorities, like making our financial system more sympathetic to illegal drugs or permitting reform in name only that's already failed to pass the Senate earlier this year,\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"If Democrats wanted these controversial items so badly, they had two years to move them across the floor.\"</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) defended the proposals.</p><p>\"We've been working with Republicans,\" he said. \"It's a priority for me. I'd like to get it done. We'll try to discuss the best way to get it done.\"</p><p>Mr. McConnell also questioned whether Congress had time to finish the bill funding the government for the full year, known as the omnibus, saying that lawmakers might have to push any deal into next year, when Republicans take control of the House. The current funding bill runs out later this month.</p><p>\"I think it's becoming increasingly likely that we may need to do a short-term CR into early next year,\" said Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.), referring to a continuing resolution that sets funding at current levels. \"We're running out of time, and that may end up being the only option left that we could agree to pursue.\"</p><p>Democrats rejected that assertion.</p><p>\"Several weeks remaining are in the calendar year, which is an eternity in Washington,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who will be the minority leader in the next Congress. \"It's certainly a preliminary, premature observation that we need to move to a continuing resolution.\"</p><p>Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said negotiators still hadn't settled on a topline spending figure, with a gap of about $25 billion in domestic spending between what Democrats and Republicans are seeking. He estimates total discretionary spending at about $1. 7 trillion.</p><p>\"I think we've got a good chance to work this out before we leave here,\" Mr. Shelby said. Asked if there had been much movement on that topline figure, Mr. Shelby said \"a lot of discussion.\"</p><p>Leading the push for permitting is Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). His proposal would advance laws to speed up the U.S. permitting process for major energy projects across the country, including natural-gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines, wind farms and solar-power installations.</p><p>Some Democrats and environmentalists worry that speeding up oil and gas projects could risk damaging ecosystems and compromise the health of nearby residents.</p><p>Other Democrats might be willing to clear hurdles to building electricity lines that connect cities to solar or wind developments, even if it means compromising by allowing natural-gas pipeline development. The measure has had support from fossil-fuel and clean-energy developers along with President Biden.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) made the pitch on adding permitting to the bill during the Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday, saying it would unleash previously approved funding for renewables projects, deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill said.</p><p>Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) said Tuesday that the U.S. urgently needed to make changes to permitting and that the defense-policy bill might be the best chance of getting something into law.</p><p>Ms. Capito said it was important to include language that would speed up permitting for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that would move natural gas from shale formations in northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia that environmental groups opposed.</p><p>\"The MVP pipeline carries the day for me, no matter what,\" she said.</p><p>Lobbyists for Boeing Co. want lawmakers to include a provision that would lift a Dec. 27 deadline for the company to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. The company would otherwise be required by law to install modern cockpit-alerting systems to help pilots resolve emergencies following two deadly crashes.</p><p>The deadline was set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without a waiver, Boeing said in a securities filing that it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. The company has said having common cockpit types among all MAX jets would be safer.</p><p>Bank lobbyists are pushing for a provision that would shield banks from penalties if they handle marijuana-related transactions.</p><p>Lenders that do business with the cannabis industry theoretically risk losing their federal banking charters because marijuana, despite being legal in some states, remains illegal on a federal level. As a result, some marijuana businesses are excluded from credit-card processing and tend to rely heavily on cash to operate, making them targets for robberies, supporters of the provision say.</p><p>House lawmakers have passed a similar provision several times but it hasn't advanced in the Senate.</p><p>Lawmakers could also include a proposal that would create a process for publishers of smaller news outlets to negotiate for compensation when technology companies such as Facebook and Google use their content. Media executives have said that small, local news organizations feel they don't have the size or resources needed to negotiate with the much larger tech companies.</p><p>The proposal's potential inclusion in the bill prompted Meta Platforms Inc.to threaten on Monday to remove news from Facebook in retaliation.</p><p>Last-minute discussions do include one military-related policy: Republicans want the bill to revoke a Department of Defense rule from August 2021 that requires members of the U.S. military to get the Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Roughly 3,400 U.S. military members have been discharged for refusing to get the vaccine as of April, according to a letter that Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) and a dozen other Republican colleagues sent a letter to party leaders on the issue.</p><p>\"Certainly at a time when our recruiting and retention efforts are under threat, I support the effort to eliminate the vaccine mandate,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said to reporters.</p><p>Administration officials acknowledged this week the possibility that the Pentagon's vaccine mandate could be repealed in the defense bill, but said they continue to believe that the vaccine saves lives.</p><p>Eliza Collins, Andrew Tangel and Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katy.stech@wsj.com, Andrew Tangel at andrew.tangel@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com</p><p>Lawmakers Spar Over Marijuana, Energy Permits in Defense-Bill Talks</p>",
