  "text": "<p>Apple is taking another bite out of the digital-advertising industry. Chief Executive Tim Cook on Monday announced new features to help users control how their online data is used by third parties. Those changes will allow users to deny the ability of marketers to see if and when an email is opened through Apple's Mail app. Users will also be able to hide IP address information to prevent tracking web usage on the Safari browser. This comes a year after Apple angered software developers by saying it would make it harder to track iPhone users' digital footprints. Apple shares rose 0.7% Tuesday.</p><p>GAMESTOP CORP.</p><p>GME +0.9%</p><p>GameStop is resetting its leadership team. The company named two Amazon.com Inc. veterans as its chief executive and chief financial officer, and shareholders voted Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy Inc., has spent seven months pushing for GameStop to move faster into e-commerce and away from its bricks-and-mortar roots. GameStop's elevated share price has helped it find cash for its turnaround plan; the company raised more than a half-billion dollars from an April stock sale. GameStop shares added 0.9% Wednesday.</p><p>MODERNA INC.</p><p>MRNA -0.2%</p><p>Teens may soon have a second vaccine. Moderna Inc. said Thursday it has asked U.S. health regulators to authorize the use of its Covid-19 shot for those aged 12 to 17 as Americans continue to get vaccinated. Moderna and Pfizer are also studying their shots in children younger than age 12, and the companies said initial results from that testing could be available by the fall. Moderna shares fell 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>CAMPBELL SOUP CO.</p><p>CPB -6.5%</p><p>Shoppers' appetite for Campbell's has cooled. The soup maker's pandemic-fueled surge in demand came to an end in the recent quarter as some customers returned to restaurants and offices, while higher costs cut into profits. Food makers received an unprecedented boost last year as people ate more at home. Now, inflationary pressures are hampering profits for food manufacturers just as Covid-19 wanes and the U.S. economy reopens. Campbell and others are raising prices to compensate for higher transportation, commodity and labor costs. Campbell shares lost 6.5% Wednesday.</p><p>UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC.</p><p>UPS -4.2%</p><p>Same-day delivery may be en route to UPS. The package-delivery company is testing the concept, Chief Executive Carol Tome said Wednesday, as the acceleration of e-commerce pushes retailers to add more curbside and same-day delivery options. Amazon.com Inc., one of UPS's biggest customers, and Instacart Inc. are among the current providers of same-day delivery. Food-delivery services such as DoorDash Inc. have also expanded into groceries during the pandemic. UPS and rival FedEx Corp. generally don't deliver packages on the same day they receive them. UPS shares fell 4.2% Wednesday.</p><p>BOEING CO.</p><p>BA -0.4%</p><p>Soaring domestic air travel is helping Boeing find new homes for its jets. Major U.S. carriers like United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. are among recent buyers of 737 MAX planes that went unclaimed after buyers walked away or collapsed during the pandemic. The purchases have left the Chicago-based plane maker with around 10 stored MAX aircraft needing buyers; last July, it had roughly 100. Flights in the U.S. are on average 84% full amid a surge of summer travel, and carriers have responded by adding more flights and workers. Boeing shares lost 0.4% Friday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -0.1%</p><p>Big Tech may be forced to get a lot smaller. House lawmakers on Friday proposed bipartisan legislation that could require Amazon and other tech giants to effectively split into two companies or shed their private-label products. The proposed legislation includes a bill could mandate structural separation of Amazon, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Another bill targets the ability of Big Tech to leverage their online platforms to favor their own products over competitors. Amazon shares fell 0.1% Friday.</p>",
