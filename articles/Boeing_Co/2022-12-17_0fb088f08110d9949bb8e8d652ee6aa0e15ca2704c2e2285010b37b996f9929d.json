  "text": "<p>This Icelandic airline began trans-Atlantic flights to Reykjavik this year with a fleet of narrowbody Airbus jets from a trio of East Coast gateways: Baltimore/Washington International, Boston Logan and New York's Stewart Airport, in Newburgh. Next up: Washington Dulles, launching next spring with Play's trademark low fares beginning at $199 one-way. From Iceland, Play offers connecting flights to Paris, Berlin, Prague, Barcelona and other European cities.</p><p>Norse Atlantic Airways</p><p>The latest airline upstart from Norway, Norse Atlantic launched last summer with cheap flights from New York to Oslo, London and Berlin aboard Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The airline offers a range of fare classes, from \"Light\" (similar to basic economy) at fares starting at $135 one-way to \"Plus\" with free checked bags, meals and more flexibility on ticket changes, and a roomier premium class with recliner seats. The other U.S. cities on the airline's route map include Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles and Orlando. Flights from New York to Paris are expected to start in March.</p><p>Condor Airlines</p><p>The Condor brand started out as a German charter line decades ago, but it's still relatively unknown among U.S. travelers. After a reorganization following the collapse of its parent company, Thomas Cook airlines, Condor offers scheduled service year-round between Germany and New York, Los Angeles and Seattle. It also operates seasonal flights to other U.S. cities including Boston, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Prices start at $250 one-way economy; there's also a premium section. Starting next month, the airline plans to roll out a fleet of new widebody Airbus A330neos, painted in distinctive striped livery.</p><p>French Bee</p><p>This Gallic upstart, which launched six years ago as \"French Blue,\" raised its trans-Atlantic profile last year. It now flies from Newark, L.A. and San Francisco to Paris Orly, with Miami flights slated to begin Dec. 15. French Bee also flies from San Francisco to Tahiti. Flights are via Airbus A350 widebody jets. Economy fares range from as low as $227 one-way from New York to Paris in March, to $453 one-way in June and July. In line with other low-cost airlines, amenities like a checked bag and a meal cost extra.</p><p>Neos Air</p><p>Another budget contender, Neos has been around for a while, operating a network of flights to tourist destinations around the world from its base in Italy. It recently expanded to the U.S. with three flights a week between New York's JFK Airport and Milan, via 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Fares start at $218 one-way.</p>",
