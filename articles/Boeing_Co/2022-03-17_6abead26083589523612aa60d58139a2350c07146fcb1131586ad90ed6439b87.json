  "text": "<p>The impact of sanctions has reverberated across Russia, leading to factory closures, job losses, a doubling of interest rates and a decline of the ruble. Inflation has galloped ahead of the central bank's target. Russia is at risk of defaulting on its debt.</p><p>Mr. Putin said the West's effort to organize an \"economic blitzkrieg\" against Russia had failed, but warned there would likely be further attempts to step up pressure on Russia.</p><p>Referring to an exodus of Western companies from Russia in recent weeks, Mr. Putin held out an olive branch to those multinational companies still doing business in his country.</p><p>\"We value the position of those foreign companies that, despite the inexcusable pressure from the U.S. and its vassals, continue to work in our country,\" he said. \"Going forward, they will definitely receive additional opportunities for development.\"</p><p>The remarks came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to the U.S. Congress, urging lawmakers to further ratchet up economic pressure on Russia for the invasion. He also called on legislators to pressure American companies in their districts that are still doing business with Russia to stop.</p><p>Mr. Putin pledged to carry out a raft of measures to offset the pain of the sanctions on Russians, including increased payments to pensioners and state employees, an increase in the minimum wage and financial assistance to businesses. The purchasing power of ordinary Russians has been deeply eroded after Western sanctions triggered a sharp devaluation of the ruble.</p><p>But Mr. Putin stopped short of endorsing Soviet-style price controls. He also said Russia's central bank wouldn't resort to printing money to meet the government's spending needs.</p><p>Coordinated U.S. and European Union sanctions have hammered the Russian economy, cutting off much of Russia's financial system from the rest of the world and choking off the flow of many imported goods. Western companies ranging from Boeing Co. to McDonald's Corp. to Volkswagen AG have pulled back from Russia.</p><p>In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Putin blasted one of the West's main financial weapons against Russia -- freezing the assets of Russia's central bank held in North America and Europe. That prevented Moscow from using much of its stockpile of $630 billion in reserves to prop up the ruble.</p><p>\"Now everyone knows that financial reserves can simply be stolen,\" Mr. Putin said.</p>",
