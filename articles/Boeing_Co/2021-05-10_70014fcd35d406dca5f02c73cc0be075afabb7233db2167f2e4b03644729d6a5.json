  "text": "<p>\n  Thematic ETFs, exchange-traded funds that focus on specific investment themes, are booming And one of the most-talked-about themes lately is space. There is no shortage of ways to invest in the final frontier. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The classics </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Historically, the way to invest in space has been in aerospace and defense ETFs. </p><p>\n  Before Elon Musk was shooting cars into orbit, space exploration was a purely governmental affair. Aerospace and defense companies were building the rockets, and many of them still are. </p><p>\n  Funds with large positions in companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman tend to have lower volatility and turnover than funds focused on the newer, high-growth companies that compete in space. Aerospace and defense ETFs come in both actively managed and passive, or index, varieties. On the passive side, iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (ITA) and SPDR S&amp;P Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (XAR) offer broad exposure to the old guard of companies and low turnover. ITA has an expense ratio of 0.44% and XAR 0.35%. </p><p>\n  On the active side, the leveraged fund Direxion Daily Aerospace &amp; Defense Bull 3X Shares (DFEN) is designed for short-term investing. This fund's goal is to provide triple the daily return of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace &amp; Defense Index; but it can also triple the losses if the market goes the other way. You'll also have to pay up: With an expense ratio of 0.99%, DFEN is more expensive than an unleveraged ETF. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The innovators </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The space industry is still small. But a number of high-profile private and listed companies have emerged -- including Mr. Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson. </p><p>\n  Even companies like Dish Network have a significant investment in space through their use of low-orbit satellites to enhance television and internet service. </p><p>\n  Two SPDR funds will give you passive or index-fund access to the innovators -- SPDR S&amp;P Kensho Future Security ETF (FITE) and SPDR S&amp;P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF (ROKT). </p><p>\n  FITE has an expense ratio of 0.45% and invests in companies focused on new areas of national security, including space. FITE is a bit of a combo platter in that it offers exposure to companies that will respond to many of the mandates of the Space Force. It has a mix of investments in aerospace and defense, cybersecurity, and drone development. </p><p>\n  ROKT, meanwhile, isn't a pure space play. The fund invests in companies that explore \"deep space and the deep sea,\" according to its fact sheet. The investment weighting is 66% aerospace and defense (or space), and 34% research, industrial materials and other components used in space and deep-sea exploration -- companies such as Hexcel Corp., which makes high-performance composite materials and other components used in both types of exploration. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.45%. </p><p>\n   Procure Space ETF (UFO) from ProcureAM offers the most direct exposure to space innovators. UFO invests only in companies that derive a majority of their revenue from space. You'll get access to Virgin Galactic in UFO, but also Dish, Sirius XM and Weathernews -- companies with significant investments in satellites for consumer use. UFO is a bit pricier with an expense ratio of 0.75%. </p><p>\n  Finally, the newest entrant: ARK Invest's ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF (ARKX). Because it has a broader mandate, you'll get access to Virgin Galactic but also companies like Deere &amp; Co. that will benefit from improvements in GPS and other satellite technologies. ARKX is actively managed and the expense ratio is the same as UFO at 0.75%. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. McCann is a writer in New York. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
