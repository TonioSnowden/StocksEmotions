  "title": "Personal Investing: A Monthly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: Four Hot ETF Sectors That Wall Street Is Betting On --- Financial pros say these industries look promising in a volatile 2022",
  "text": "<p>More than $100 billion flowed into equity sector ETFs in 2021, up from $70 billion in 2020, says Morningstar Inc. There are now 494 such funds with a combined $806 billion in assets, up from 370 equity sector ETFs with assets of $346 billion in 2016.</p><p>\"One of the big investment consequences of the pandemic is that people are looking for more targeted exposures, either within sectors or across sectors,\" says Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X ETFs.</p><p>When evaluating sector ETFs, \"investors should look at a fund's top 10 holdings to determine its purity within a sector or theme, and its expense ratio to determine its cost,\" says Jeff Spiegel, U.S. head of BlackRock's iShares Megatrend, International and Sector ETFs. Investors also should look for funds that focus on companies with \"higher-quality, high-yielding equities since there are so many risks swirling about in the marketplace,\" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA.</p><p>So which sectors are most likely to benefit from factors shaking up the economy?</p><p>Here are four sectors that research analysts predict will be hot and that have high earnings-per-share growth forecasts for 2022, according to consensus estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>1. Movies &amp; entertainment</p><p>This industry has one of the highest growth expectations for 2022, with analysts expecting per-share earnings to rise 57.5% from last year, according to S&amp;P Global data as of Dec. 31. The industry hit a low point in the U.S. in 2020 with the closing of movie theaters amid the pandemic and lockdowns. But box-office revenue is poised to recover, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is predicting a 37.3% compound annual growth rate for revenue through 2025.</p><p>\"The combination of the reopening of movie theaters and demand for streaming entertainment is fueling a resurgence,\" says Mr. Stovall.</p><p>Among funds in this sector is Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), which has $14 billion in assets and top holdings in companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., AT&amp;T Inc., Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. The fund, which was up 16% in 2021, has an expense ratio of 0.12%.</p><p>Downside risk: Earnings growth could stall if the Omicron variant continues to flare up.</p><p>2. Aerospace/defense</p><p>Per-share earnings are expected to grow 25.2% in 2022. All areas of the sector are poised for growth, says Deloitte's \"Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook\" for 2022. \"Some of the most exciting things to watch in 2022 are in space flight, efforts to decarbonize the aviation industry, airport infrastructure development and the emergence of vertical lift aircraft [those that can depart, hover and land vertically],\" says John Coykendall, global aerospace and defense leader for Deloitte. While the latest Omicron variant will challenge travel in the short term, Deloitte says it believes that both domestic and international travel will continue to recover in 2022.</p><p>Funds include iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense (ITA), with $2.5 billion in net assets and top holdings in Raytheon Technologies Corp., Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. It returned 9.4% in 2021 and has an expense ratio of 0.42%.</p><p>Downside risk: The No. 1 concern is that the Omicron surge could trigger lockdowns and slow air traffic recovery.</p><p>3. Online retail</p><p>Analysts are predicting earnings growth of 25.9% for the internet and direct-marketing retail sector. Research firm eMarketer sees U.S. e-commerce sales rising to almost $1.2 trillion by 2023, accounting for 19% of all U.S. retail sales, from $909 billion, or 15.5% of all sales, in 2021.</p><p>\"We believe online shopping will continue to be a driving force and expand,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA.</p><p>ProShares Online Retail (ONLN) has $620 million in net assets. Top holdings are in Amazon.com, Alibaba Group Holding, eBay and DoorDash. The fund, down 25% in 2021, has an expense ratio of 0.58%.</p><p>Downside risk: Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in online retail. Antitrust bills have been introduced in Congress targeting Amazon and Big Tech.</p><p>4. Oil and gas</p><p>Oil-and-gas exploration is forecast to increase this year, and the sector is expected to post 39% earnings growth. \"We think the market has been overestimating the long-term decline in demand for oil and petroleum products,\" says Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist. Stewart Glickman, CFRA's energy equity analyst, predicts that companies such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Pioneer Natural Resources \"will spend 15% to 17% more on exploration and development in 2022.\"</p><p>Among ETFs, iShares U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production (IEO) has more than $320 million in net assets and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration and Production Index. Top holdings include Conoco Phillips, EOG Resources and Pioneer. The ETF surged 76% last year. It has an expense ratio of 0.42%.</p><p>Downside risk: Another Covid-related relapse could slow the economy. OPEC could also lose its supply discipline.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Ioannou is a writer in New York. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p>",
