  "title": "Boeing delays 777X deliveries again as it posts record annual loss",
  "text": "<p>Boeing delayed the entry of its wide-body 777X jet into commercial service by another year and posted a record net loss of nearly $12bn for 2020, even as it began delivering the 737 Max to customers last month.</p> <p>The company will not start delivering the 777X — which can seat 384 passengers — to airlines until late 2023, and has taken a charge of $6.5bn to reflect the programme's decreased productivity. Several other charges brought the total for the quarter to $8.3bn.</p> <p>The aerospace manufacturer attributed the delay to diminished demand because of Covid-19 and customer requests to take planes later, as well as an updated assessment of how long it will take aviation regulators to certify the plane.</p> <p>David Calhoun, chief executive, told investors that Boeing planned to make design changes to the jet's actuators, which convert electrical signals to mechanical movement, as well as the software that controls them, based on global regulators' requirements. </p> <p>“This schedule, and the associated financial impact, reflects a number of factors,” Mr Calhoun said. “We remain confident in the 777X.”</p> <p>The market's demand for wide-body jets was already softening before the pandemic hit. The outbreak has further deflated the appeal of larger jets to airlines as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3190522f-ad61-432a-b62d-270a068c90fa\">passengers' appetite for international travel </a>has lagged behind their return to domestic flights.</p> <p>The 777X was supposed to enter commercial service in late 2020 before the company pushed that date out twice, most recently in July, to 2022. Previously, the delays were driven by problems with its General Electric engine.</p> <p>Boeing's financial results also reflected continued fallout from the 737 Max — which crashed twice in five months, killing 346 people — even as the plane began re-entering commercial service. The US Federal Aviation Administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43bb3ab1-598d-4ee3-a83b-ea0c22f08d4a\">lifted its grounding order</a> on the plane late last year, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency formally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bc07cfe-f428-49db-95df-6bb45dba1b9d\">cleared the jet</a> on Wednesday. </p> <p>So far five airlines have returned the Max to their schedules. Ryanair has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c32696e-56fc-43a5-b3d4-49daa169bcbd\">ordered</a> 75 planes, and Alaska Airlines took delivery of one of the jets this week.</p> <p>The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $8.4bn on revenue of $15.3bn, a 15 per cent drop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Its full-year net loss of $11.9bn on $58.2bn in revenue, a drop of 24 per cent compared with 2019, plummeted past 2019's $636m loss. The 2019 net loss had been Boeing's first annual loss in more than two decades.</p> <p>Boeing shares fell 4 per cent to $194.03 on Wednesday.</p> <p>“2020 was a year of profound societal and global disruption which significantly constrained our industry,” Mr Calhoun said. “The deep impact of the pandemic on commercial air travel, coupled with the 737 Max grounding, challenged our results . . . Our balanced portfolio of diverse defence, space and services programmes continues to provide important stability as we lay the foundation for our recovery.”</p> <p>Boeing has been gradually slowing production rates and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5c6625b-13bc-4af9-a242-d9c620f24956\">cutting the size of its workforce</a> as it attempts to manage the drop in demand from airlines. The company said in December it was cutting production rates on the 787 wide-body jet, known as the Dreamliner, yet again. It is now down to five a month, from 14 originally.</p> <p>Boeing also continued to spend cash rather than generate it, and Greg Smith, chief financial officer, said that pattern would hold in 2021. It said in October it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5c6625b-13bc-4af9-a242-d9c620f24956\">still hoped</a> to begin to generate cash this year.</p> <p>Much of the reason is that even though Boeing has begun delivering Maxes again — 40 since the grounding was lifted — it is not delivering 787s. The company has 80 of those planes in inventory as it checks them for flaws after workers in South Carolina installed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b23498e5-803c-4bf8-8030-52fc821d323c\">the wrong-sized shims</a> in fuselage joints.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter of 2020, Boeing's free cash flow — operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, and an important metric for investors — was a $4.3bn outflow, compared to a $2.7bn outflow for the same period a year earlier. The outflow for the year was $19.7bn, nearly five times larger than in 2019.</p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Claire Bushey in Chicago 2021 'Boeing delays 777X deliveries again as it posts record annual loss' FT.com 27 January.
