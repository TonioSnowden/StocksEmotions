  "title": "Business News: Airbus Wins First Order for New Freighter",
  "text": "<p>Shipments of medical supplies and personal protective gear gave cargo an early-pandemic boost, bolstered by a lockdown-fed boom in e-commerce. More recently, manufacturers around the world have turned increasingly to airfreight to bypass snarled ports, packed ships and trucking shortages that have delayed cheaper cargo delivery by land and sea.</p><p>Two of the world's largest container shipping companies, A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S and CMA CGM SA, have ordered new Boeing 777 freighter jets this year, citing a need to have air-cargo options for customers.</p><p>Airlines, too, have turned increasingly to cargo as a lifeline during the pandemic. Many have retooled their passenger planes, and their schedules, to allow for more airfreight to make up for less passenger traffic. Some have said they won't give up cargo even when passengers return to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Almost three-quarters of passenger-focused airlines expect their air cargo volumes to continue rising over the next year from already-elevated levels, according to a recent poll by the International Air Transport Association.</p><p>The trade group said global cargo traffic in September was up 9.1% from the same month in 2019.</p><p>Airbus said at the Dubai Air Show on Monday that the freighter order came from rental giant Air Lease Corp. with deliveries set to start in 2026. The deal was part of a larger order for 111 aircraft across Airbus's product line, including 100 narrow-bodies and four A330neo wide-bodies. The leasing firm has a history of being the first to snare new Airbus models.</p><p>\"We're responding to the invitation for competition in the market,\" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said at a press conference. \"It's not so much a matter of breaking in, or stealing the bacon from somebody else. It is a matter of responding to the call from the market, and not just from one or two players, but many.\"</p>",
