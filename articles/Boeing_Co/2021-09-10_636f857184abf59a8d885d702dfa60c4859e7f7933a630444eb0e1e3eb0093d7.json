  "text": "<p>The administration \"wants it to be a full-court press,\" said one of the people familiar with the discussions. No final decisions have been made, the people said. Some details were earlier reported by Bloomberg News.</p><p>The planned actions come as the U.S. Trade Representative's office winds up its monthslong review of China policy, amid rising criticism by U.S. business leaders that the White House is taking too long to address key issues dividing the world's two largest economies.</p><p>Boeing Co. executives, in particular, have argued that the lack of a China policy has hindered its China sales.</p><p>As part of its review, the USTR has decided to try to enforce China's commitments under the Phase One accord negotiated by the Trump administrationto boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over 2020 and 2021.</p><p>China fell short of those targets by about 40% in 2020 and is now 30% behind its scheduled purchases for 2021, according to calculations by Chad Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials have been discussing the shortfalls, said the people familiar with the talks, but haven't agreed on a way to address them. Higher level discussions haven't begun.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has had one conversation so far with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He. Even so, the administration is moving closer to unveiling its broader Chinese plan. On Thursday, President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping had their second extensive conversation, with both sides seeking to keep the overall relationship from deteriorating further.</p><p>As part of the China review, USTR doesn't plan a wholesale reduction in tariffs on more than half of Chinese imports which were imposed during the Trump years, according to the people familiar with its planning.</p><p>Instead, the USTR has been conducting exercises to see which tariffs are hurting the U.S. economy or could substantially raise the costs of other parts of the Biden agenda, these people said, particularly the president's plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into new U.S. infrastructure.</p><p>Aside from cutting some of those tariffs, U.S. officials are looking at granting exclusions from tariffs for some products, the people said.</p><p>Write to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.com and Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Administration Takes Aim at China's Industrial Subsidies</p>",
