  "text": "<p>   The rate cuts hadn't immediately calmed investors. Stock trading was halted for 15 minutes on the morning of March 16 when the S&amp;P 500 fell 7%, triggering a so-called circuit breaker. The index staggered to the closing bell, down 12%L </p><p>   That same day, Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, made three purchases in stock funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. stock market broadly, totaling between $600,003 and $1.2 million, according to her financial disclosures. </p><p>   After Republican frustration with a previous piece of relief legislation, Ms. Chao's husband, then-Senate Majority Leader McConnell, had taken the reins in Congress on a much larger bill. He released his first draft on March 19. </p><p>   Ms. Chao was also working on the pandemic response. Her agency -- part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force -- was helping repatriate Americans abroad, conducting screenings at airports, establishing health protocols for airlines and cruise ships and coordinating with international counterparts, she told a House committee. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 hit bottom on March 23. From its high on Feb. 19, it had dropped nearly 34%. </p><p>   The next day, the administration and Congress neared a deal on the stimulus bill. The stock market soared on the news -- and with it Ms. Chao's mutual fund investment from eight days earlier. </p><p>   Mr. Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or Cares Act, on March 27, handing out pens to guests, including Ms. Chao and Mr. McConnell. Ms. Chao released a statement praising the administration's pandemic response, saying the bill \"ensures that critical federal resources will soon reach where they are needed.\" </p><p>   By the end of the month, her investment in the S&amp;P fund had gained 8%. By the end of the year, it was up 57%, according to its net asset value. </p><p>   Ms. Chao's total disclosed purchases in March 2020 were between $669,009 and $1.5 million, her second-highest monthly total in the Journal's review of her four years as transportation secretary. </p><p>   A spokesman for Ms. Chao said she periodically adjusts her investments in mutual funds based on the advice of financial professionals. \"These funds are held separately from her husband and managed without his consultation,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   A spokesman for Mr. McConnell referred the Journal to the statement by Ms. Chao's representative. </p><p>   At around the same time, a Treasury official later involved in administering the stimulus package made a series of well-timed trades. </p><p>   Early on, the Trump administration made it clear it wouldn't leave Boeing or the rest of the aviation and airline sector hanging, as the travel industry was thrown into turmoil. \"We have to protect Boeing,\" Mr. Trump said March 17. \"We'll be helping Boeing.\" </p><p>   The Treasury Department publicly detailed what it wanted to see in the stimulus legislation on March 18, including $50 billion in loans for airlines and $450 billion for \"severely distressed sectors\" and small businesses. </p><p>   Two days later, Treasury domestic finance counselor Jeff Goettman reported purchases of 15 stocks, including Boeing and General Electric, totaling between $29,015 and $260,000, according to his financial disclosure. </p><p>   Boeing was in close contact with Treasury officials as it lobbied the administration and Congress for federal aid. </p><p>   Days after Mr. Goettman's stock purchases, lawmakers inserted a $17 billion provision for companies deemed essential to national security, which congressional officials said at the time was partly designed to help Boeing. </p><p>   The provision stayed in the final legislation, authorizing the Treasury to administer the loan fund. Then-Secretary Steven Mnuchin later said the fund had been created with companies including Boeing and GE in mind. </p><p>   Mr. Goettman convened the group that administered the legislation's $80 billion for airlines -- which included the national-security loan fund -- according to his bio on the website of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for whom he now serves as chief of staff. Boeing didn't ultimately apply because it objected to the condition that the U.S. take an equity stake or warrants for shares in loan recipients, its chief executive said at the time. </p><p>   A week after Mr. Goettman's March 20 stock purchases, Boeing's shares were up 70%, and GE's were up 17%. </p><p>   Mr. Goettman declined to comment. </p><p>   The Treasury declined to comment on his trading. A spokesman said: \"The Treasury Department follows regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics and we expect all employees to follow them. These regulations include the disclosure of stock purchases, recusals to avoid conflicts of interest and a prohibition against using nonpublic information to inform financial activities.\" </p><p>   Mr. Goettman disclosed more GE stock purchases on March 27 and April 1, totaling between $2,002 and $30,000. </p><p>   On April 2, Mr. Trump ordered the federal government to help six medical-device manufacturers, including GE, secure supplies they needed to make ventilators for hospitalized Covid patients. </p><p>   Mr. Goettman reported additional GE share purchases that day, bringing his GE investment to the range of $3,003 to $45,000. </p><p>   Two weeks later, HHS disclosed a $336 million government contract with GE to produce 50,000 ventilators. The stock rose more than 5% on the news. </p><p></p>",
