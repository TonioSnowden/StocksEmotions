  "text": "<p>   Regarding Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner's op-ed on the Illinois Workers' Rights Amendment (\"Unions Ask Illinois Voters to Sign Over Control of the State,\" Oct. 22): Do union leaders understand that the citizens of Illinois are free to leave when unions extract too much from taxpayers? </p><p>   Even gangsters know that you can't demand too much protection money, or else you drive businesses out of the area. This seems like another instance of progressives not thinking two steps ahead to appreciate the likely long-term consequences of very bad policy. </p><p>   Dana R. Hermanson </p><p>    Marietta, Ga. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Boeing, Citadel, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods have already left Illinois. The only good news is that if you move out of state, you escape Illinois's looming debt and unfunded pension liability. </p><p>   Charles E. Campbell </p><p>    Flossmoor, Ill. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Messrs. Dabrowski and Klingner shed light on the Illinois Democratic Party's attempt to embed double-dealing in the state constitution. Unlike in the private sector, where federal laws prohibit collusion between unions and management and ensure that the two parties are on opposing sides of the bargaining table, public-sector unions take full advantage of a legal right they shouldn't have to bribe \"management\" -- elected officials -- via campaign contributions. </p><p>   This corrupt arrangement, which blossomed in the late 20th century, costs Americans billions of dollars annually. Here's hoping that enough Prairie State voters recognize this proposed amendment for what it really is -- a move to cement one-party Democratic rule -- and vote it down. If not, it won't be long before the Illinois Democratic Party achieves its goal of being referred to simply as \"the party.\" </p><p>   John Faure </p><p>    Birmingham, Ala. </p><p></p>",
