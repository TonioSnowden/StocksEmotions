  "title": "China Eastern Airlines Crash: One of Plane's Black Boxes Is Found; Authorities are verifying whether the device is a flight-data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder",
  "text": "<p>Footage from China's official Xinhua News Agency showed officials on a muddy, forested hillside placing the orange, cylinder-shaped device into a plastic bag with their gloved hands.</p><p>The plane, operated by China Eastern Airlines, was carrying 132 people when it plunged to the ground on Monday in a rural part of China's Guangxi region.</p><p>The two black boxes store vital information and typically provide accident investigations the best information about what caused a plane to go down. The devices, both bright orange, are hardened to withstand even significant impact and their data can often be useful to investigators even if the boxes are damaged.</p><p>Typically, the recovered black box would now be sent to a specialized air accident investigation facility where the information it contains is downloaded and analyzed. That process can take a couple of days, depending on the damage the device has sustained.</p><p>Heavy rain hampered search efforts on Wednesday. More than 2,000 rescuers, armed with shovels and flashlights, combed through mountainous terrain and began discovering human remains at the crash site.</p><p>Mr. Mao said the weather wasn't dangerous at the time of the crash, and that air-traffic controllers and aircrew members had maintained normal communication up until the sudden drop in the jet's altitude.</p><p>The air-safety regulator has said the plane was at a cruise altitude of 8,900 meters, or about 29,000 feet, at 2:17 p.m. local time and that a controller noticed a sharp drop at 2:20 p.m. At 2:23 p.m., the radar signal of the aircraft disappeared.</p><p>Tracking data from Flightradar24 shows that the jet plummeted from the sky, reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet a minute, or more than 350 miles an hour. It initially fell to an altitude of 7,425 feet when it briefly managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again diving toward the mountain—a trajectory some air safety experts said was very unusual.</p><p>The plane was operated by a captain and two co-pilots who were qualified and had performed well, Sun Shiying, chairman of China Eastern's subsidiary branch based in southwestern China's Yunnan province, said Wednesday in the news conference. The chief pilot was hired as a Boeing 737 captain in January 2018, with flight experiences totaling 6,709 hours, Mr. Sun said, while the co-pilots respectively had 31,769 and 556 hours under their belts. They weren't named.</p><p>The wreckage of the plane was strewn across a hilly, forested area. An army of rescuers—including soldiers and firefighters—and excavators dug into the land where the crash's impact wiped out trees and a terraced field, video from state broadcaster China Central Television showed.</p><p>The rain soaked the crash site, forcing rescuers to suspend their effort, CCTV reported, adding that the smell of fuel still lingered at the scene. The broadcaster said rescuers warned the rain could cause small-scale landslides.</p><p>The plane was carrying nine crew members and 123 passengers. With no survivors found, it could be China's worst plane crash in almost three decades.</p><p>Ou Ling, a fire department official in Wuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region near the crash site, told CCTV on Tuesday that human remains have been found. Details about any recovery of bodies remained scarce in Chinese media.</p><p>Mr. Ou said the narrow paths to the crash site have prevented larger rescue equipment from entering, adding that the lack of lighting facilities in the mountains—especially at night—has complicated their mission, according to state media.</p><p>A spokesman for China's airline regulator, Zhu Tao, said at a briefing late Tuesday that the severely damaged jet has made the investigation difficult and the cause of the crash couldn't yet be determined.</p><p>The plane, a Boeing 737-800, was suitable for flying and reported no technical issues before takeoff and its aircrew were in good health and met flying requirements, Chinese officials said Tuesday. China Eastern had been in contact with the family members of all passengers onboard, Mr. Sun said.</p><p>Boeing has said it was working with the airline and its experts are prepared to assist with the investigation.</p><p>Rachel Liang and Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Elaine Yu at elaine.yu@wsj.com</p><p>China Eastern Airlines Crash: One of Plane's Black Boxes Is Found</p>",
