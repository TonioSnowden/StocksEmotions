  "title": "Qantas Plans Nonstop Flights to Australia From New York, London; Airline orders dozens of planes from Airbus, including some to provide the long-haul service starting in late 2025",
  "text": "<p>\"The board's decision to approve what is the largest aircraft order in Australian aviation is a clear vote of confidence in the future of the Qantas Group,\" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. The airline said the aircraft will also be able to operate nonstop flights to Australia from destinations such as Paris and Frankfurt.</p><p>Qantas said it is ordering 12 Airbus A350-1000s for its Project Sunrise flights. In addition, the airline said it is ordering 40 A321XLRs and A220 aircraft for its domestic fleet, as well as 94 purchase-order options that will spread over at least a decade. Those planes will replace aging Boeing 737s and 717s, Qantas said.</p><p>Qantas didn't disclose the cost of the Airbus order, but said a significant discount from the standard price should be assumed.</p><p>Combined with an existing order for its budget airline Jetstar, Qantas said its total group order with Airbus now includes 299 planes, half of which are direct orders and half of which are purchase-right options.</p><p>Qantas also said Monday that domestic travel is returning to pre-Covid levels ahead of expectations. It said there is strong demand for international travel, but that some key markets aren't yet open.</p><p>Australia had largely closed its border to tourists for much of the pandemic and imposed restrictions on citizens and others as well. Those restrictions loosened earlier this year, leading the country's tourism department to start a new ad campaign.</p><p>Qantas's underlying earnings before interest, tax and other items, or Ebitda, is expected to be between 450 million Australian dollars (US$318 million) and A$550 million in the second half of fiscal 2022, the airline said.</p><p>Shares of Qantas rose 2.9% Monday in Australian trading.</p><p>Write to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com</p><p>Qantas Plans Nonstop Flights to Australia From New York, London</p>",
