  "title": "World News:  Indonesia Probe Looks  At Pilot-Tower Mix-Up  ----  By Andy Pasztor and Jon Emont",
  "text": "<p>   A communication breakdown between pilots and air-traffic controllers has emerged as an early focus of the investigation into last weekend's crash of a 1990s-era Boeing 737 in Indonesia, according to people with knowledge of the probe. </p><p>   The cockpit crew of the Sriwijaya Air jet, which plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff, failed to acknowledge or respond to two radio transmissions from controllers questioning why the aircraft had shifted from its designated route during its climb away from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, the people said. Instead of flying northeast as expected, the plane veered northwest and at one point, a controller instructed the pilots to execute a turn to get back on track, one of these people said. </p><p>   It is too early to draw conclusions about the sequence of events before the crash that killed all 62 people on board, according to these people and safety experts not connected with the probe. Authorities said the flight-data recorder, one of its so-called black boxes, was recovered Tuesday and taken to a lab so its contents can be downloaded. </p><p>   Authorities said they believe the location of the cockpit-voice recorder -- which is the other black box -- also has been identified, but rough seas prevented retrieval Wednesday. </p><p>   For now, according to the safety experts, the crew's lack of response on the radio could indicate pilot confusion or distraction. One possibility is that a problem with some mechanical or flight-control system could have consumed the pilots' attention, they said. </p><p>   Preliminary traffic-control data, the experts said, also raises the possibility the 26-year-old Boeing 737-500, which had been delayed for takeoff due to a storm, could have ended up flying through unexpected weather conditions. The jet plunged more than 10,000 feet with its engines running, but there was no mayday call or emergency transmission from the cockpit, according to investigators and publicly available radar data. Experts said the descentappeared to be a near-vertical dive. </p><p>   Barring damage to the recorders, data downloaded from them could, within days, provide direction for investigators by revealing details about changes in the jet's speed or trajectory, pilot actions, flight-control commands and potential system malfunctions. </p><p>   Indonesia's transportation ministry said earlier that air-traffic controllers tried to communicate with the pilots to get the plane back on its designated course seconds before it disappeared from radar. </p><p>   Others familiar with the probe said the crew failed to respond to a second radio call asking about the plane's direction. That transmission came around the time the jet went into its fatal dive, one of the people said. The exact timing can't be determined until data is downloaded. Initial inspections of maintenance records haven't revealed irregularities, according to another person familiar with the probe. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Andrew Tangel and Viriya Singgih contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
