DD has a story for you.</p> <p>The cast of characters includes one of Italy's wealthiest dynasties, a Spanish tycoon who also happens to be president of <strong>Real Madrid </strong>football club and one of London's most powerful hedge fund managers.</p> <p>The saga over <strong>Autostrade per l'Italia</strong>, Italy's main toll road operator, has been going on for years. And it all stems from a terrible tragedy — in 2018, Genoa's Morandi Bridge collapsed under the purview of ASPI, killing 43 people.</p> <p>ASPI's owner, the Italian infrastructure company <strong>Atlantia</strong>, and its controlling shareholders, the billionaire<strong> Benetton </strong>family, quickly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cfdbb22-a804-11e9-b6ee-3cdf3174eb89\">fell under intense scrutiny</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91042304-aa12-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">longtime chief</a> executive of ASPI, <strong>Giovanni Castellucci</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57419e18-d946-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">stepped down</a> in 2019 as Italy's then-populist coalition government made calls to nationalise the motorways, leaving both Atlantia and the Benettons to suffer the consequences.&#xa0;</p> <p>Late last year, Italy's state-controlled investment fund <strong>Cassa Depositi e Prestiti</strong>, or CDP, teamed up with <strong>Blackstone </strong>and <strong>Macquarie</strong> to bid for Atlantia's majority stake in ASPI. Their offer, which the board of Atlantia met on Thursday to consider, valued the unit at about €9bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the planned board meeting was spoilt by another development yesterday when <strong>ACS</strong>, the Spanish construction group run by one of Spain's richest men, <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong>, entered the fray, indicating in a letter that it was willing to offer up to €10bn for ASPI and outbid the CDP-led consortium.</p> <p>Here's where things get a little convoluted: ACS has been a major shareholder in the Spanish group <strong>Abertis</strong>, one of the world's leading motorway operators, since Pérez <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7790f2aa-2794-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\">struck a complex deal</a> with the Benetton family in 2018.&#xa0;</p> <p>That means both ACS and Atlantia hold significant stakes in Abertis. So one could presume Pérez's plan is to buy the Italian motorways group, then merge ASPI with Abertis at a later date.</p> <p>And he's got allies in high places. The British billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80a7a8ef-9407-40f8-b29a-11af900353f3\">hedge fund manager</a> <strong>Chris Hohn</strong>, who holds a 10 per cent interest in Atlantia and rallied against the Italian government's attempt to force the Benetton family to relinquish control of the toll roads last year, is urging Atlantia's board to think carefully about the ACS intervention.</p> <p>“ASPI should be allowed to be sold to the highest bidder without interference from the Italian government,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b05185a-9782-403d-bbf6-7fe708006c23\">he told DD's Arash Massoudi</a>. And perhaps there is a small window for a foreign buyer with Italy's new government under <strong>Mario Draghi</strong>, which has so far taken a less interventionist stance than its predecessor under <strong>Giuseppe Conte</strong>.</p> <p>Pérez has expressed that he is open to inviting CDP into its bid. What this means for Blackstone and Macquarie, however, is unclear. A person close to the CDP-consortium dismissed the possible ACS offer as speculative, unfunded and uncertain.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's not the only big deal on Pérez's to-do list. Real Madrid, the world's richest football club by revenues, has been working with <strong>JPMorgan</strong> <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/2JdzQdo\">on a radical plan</a> to upend European football.&#xa0;</p> <p>As for the Benettons, who first made their fortune selling colourful sweaters, selling would mean relinquishing one of Atlantia's most valuable assets.</p> <p>The clan's retail empire lost out to fast-fashion chains such as <strong>Zara</strong> long ago, and they have since gone on to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33b41392-4152-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2\">focus on infrastructure</a> as well as the roadside catering group <strong>Autogrill </strong>that lines Italian roadways providing reliable espresso to weary travellers.</p> <h2>The world's largest insurance broker has a Greensill problem</h2> <p>For a group that includes the world's biggest insurance broker and boasts $17bn in annual revenue, <strong>Marsh McLennan</strong> moves largely under the radar compared with large global insurers and banks.</p> <p>But the<strong> Greensill </strong>collapse has dragged Marsh, its core insurance broking business, into the spotlight.&#xa0;</p> <p>In its public statements, the broker has stressed the simple job that it performed for the supply chain finance group: it “sought coverage from insurers, who made their own determinations about what risks to cover”. Its role was “not to be an insurer, banker or credit analyst”.</p> <p>The reality appears more complicated.</p> <p>Marsh's links with<strong> Credit Suisse</strong>, which offered to its investors notes backed by Greensill-sourced assets, extended to a regular role confirming coverage on those notes that were insured; and even calls with the Swiss bank's executives regarding coverage, as the FT reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3da3d908-d7a0-4b92-847c-ebe2468aa656\">last month</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e8e5730-6225-41be-b934-10fe7c2d4062\">deep dive</a> by the FT's Ian Smith shows that Marsh played other roles, too.&#xa0;</p> <p>The insurer's aviation finance unit, the <strong>Aircraft Finance Insurance Consortium</strong>, cut a deal with Greensill in 2017 to finance the purchase of <strong>Boeing</strong> planes by the airline <strong>Norwegian Air Shuttle</strong>. AFIC added insurance to the receivables and sold them to capital-market investors. Greensill later hailed the arrangement as one example of its innovation in supply chain finance.&#xa0;</p> <p>As for its main job, recent legal filings include correspondence between Greensill, Marsh and <strong>The Bond &amp; Credit Co</strong> — the Sydney-based underwriting firm that was crucial to the finance group's securitisation machine. They provide a rare glimpse into a relationship between the insured, insurance broker and insurer just as it was faltering.</p> <p>DD readers are more likely to read about insurance brokers through the prism of a yearlong consolidation in the sector, with the current <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dafe0116-61f8-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68\">mega tie-up</a> of <strong>Aon</strong> and <strong>Willis Towers Watson</strong> just the latest example.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's this growing power that makes insurance experts nervous about the tightening “chokehold”, as one told Ian, that the big brokers have on the market.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Greensill episode demonstrates the key and varied role that brokers play finding backing for esoteric financial risks, but also the limits of their power when the insurance market hardens against a client.</p> <h2>How one British record label outdanced the pandemic</h2> <p>Over the past few weeks at DD we've been examining the future of music. There was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10ca8739-4a09-4286-919f-7d99d3c5e600\">head-scratching tie-up</a> between <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong>'s <strong>Square</strong> and <strong>Jay-Z</strong>'s <strong>Tidal</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46634730-4a79-4ff7-9e19-cd019299b57b\">investment</a> in an anti-label start-up, as music rights became a hot subject of debate (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deaf2fbf-ab2f-4d1a-b870-7fab104c122f\">and dealmaking</a>).</p> <p>But as streaming giants scrambled to innovate during the pandemic, record labels — a part of the industry especially dependent on ticket sales for live events — were left pondering their next move.</p> <p>Among them was <strong>Defected</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5b17ed0-01f0-4179-82d0-b50c98f437a7\">British house music label</a> that has released records from artists including <strong>Calvin Harris</strong> and <strong>Masters at Work</strong> which depended on bi-weekly Ibiza residencies and festivals in Croatia and London as a main source of revenue.</p> <p>To stay afloat, the label enlisted top artists including <strong>Carl Cox</strong> to take part in a 12-hour live-streamed festival as a way to connect with its audience and boost streaming numbers. It also inked a six-month partnership with the gaming streaming platform <strong>Twitch</strong> to provide live music for the platform.</p> <p>The group's chief executive and founder <strong>Simon Dunmore </strong>describes it as a “new era music company” in its pivot from reliance on live events to forging more lucrative partnerships.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/music/news/coachella-festival-moving-2022-1234933239/\"><strong>Coachella</strong></a> and other major festivals remain shut this year, the time to innovate is now.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The law firm <strong>Linklaters </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.linklaters.com/en/about-us/news-and-deals/news/2021/april/linklaters-announces-35-new-partner-elections-worldwide\">elected</a> 35 new partners.</p></li>  <li><p>Its rival <strong>Allen &amp; Overy </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/allen-overy-promotes-30-to-its-global-partnership\">announced</a> the promotion of 30 new partners.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> is hiring <strong>UBS </strong>banker<strong> Emilio Greco</strong> to head its financial services M&amp;A business in Italy.
