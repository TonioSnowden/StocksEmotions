  "text": "<p>A group of centrist US senators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e71dd284-c1f3-4835-ab5b-aaf866d5fe83\">raced to agree</a> the text of a $1tn bipartisan infrastructure package yesterday, with funding for mass transit emerging as a sticking point as tensions rose over Joe Biden's sweeping economic agenda.</p> <p>Rob Portman, Republican senator from Ohio, and Mark Warner, Democratic senator from Virginia, said in separate television interviews on Sunday that they remained confident that a final deal could be reached this week to codify the cross-party agreement struck with Biden last month.</p> <p>“We're about 90 per cent of the way there,” Portman told ABC news.</p> <p>The $1tn plan would fund investments in roads, bridges, ports, airports, water facilities and broadband networks.</p> <p>Portman said funding for mass transit projects was “one issue outstanding” on which Republicans were “not getting much response from the Democrats”.</p> <p>Republicans, who disproportionately represent rural states and communities, want lower levels of funding for public transport, whereas Democratic lawmakers, whose support is more concentrated in cities, want the agreement to include more.</p> <p>If the bill fails, Democrats are expected to include its provisions in legislation&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f6b3107-52ef-42cd-9e21-f9f4bb2c2240\">expected to exceed $3.5tn</a>&#xa0;that they intend to pass without Republican support. That bill seeks to plough money into education and child care, and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c69e21a6-d234-4fe0-87f4-4c2fa05ab74a\">would be paid for</a>&#xa0;by raising taxes on the wealthiest households and corporations.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. China cracks down on its education sector</strong> China has launched a sweeping crackdown on its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfae3282-e14e-4fea-aa5f-c2e914444fb8\">$100bn private education industry</a> that threatens to wipe out billions of dollars of investment from groups such as BlackRock, Baillie Gifford, Tencent, Sequoia and SoftBank's Vision Fund. Global investors sold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6d2f31e-72dd-4d22-aa2a-907990d43e97\">$2bn worth</a> of Chinese stocks today following the introduction of the policy over the weekend.</p> <ul>  <li><p>The UK government is exploring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4a3fe02-8535-45a4-aacf-0c4fbce8409d\">ways to remove</a> China's state-owned nuclear energy company, CGN, from all future UK power projects, according to people close to the discussions.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Man Group boss: crypto has ‘no inherent worth'</strong> The chief executive of Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, says cryptocurrencies have “no inherent worth” but are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9275baf4-0422-43a1-b8c9-9317882ca874\">creating trading opportunities</a> for his company because of their wild price swings. Luke Ellis compared cryptocurrencies to a “tulip bulb”, a reference to the flower that became the focus of a 17th century Dutch financial mania.</p> <p><strong>3. US shale dealmaking wave is transforming the industry</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/758c9b81-9200-4535-8392-1b9e807232e4\">wave of dealmaking</a> in America's shale patch is intensifying, wiping out weak players and leaving the once-fractured sector in the hands of a new breed of “super independents”. More than $30bn in oil and gas deals were done in the second quarter and analysts and bankers expect the run to continue.</p> <p><strong>4. Tunisia thrown into turmoil as president sacks prime minister</strong> Tunisia's nascent democracy is facing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d53095f-2b8a-42f4-b7b3-2ce763ab0f28\">its biggest crisis in a decade</a> after the president sacked the prime minister and suspended parliament amid anger over a surge in coronavirus cases. President Kais Saied's opponents described the sackings as a coup and a breach of the constitution in the Arab world's only democracy.</p> <p><strong>5. ‘Dream Team' suffers first Olympic defeat in 17 years</strong> France has handed the Americans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b61b84ed-9230-4bb4-a974-bab5edca04b0\">their first Olympics basketball loss</a> since 2004, winning 83-76 in the first game of the group stage. <em>You can catch up with all of today's action </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc1ce29b-2a63-407b-90d2-4194fff3b2c1\"><em>here</em></a><em> and add ‘</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/tokyo-olympics?emailId=60f9e5fa18dbce00040d86e0&amp;segmentId=60a126e8-df3c-b524-c979-f90bde8a67cd\"><em>Tokyo Olympics</em></a><em>' to myFT for all our coverage from the Games.</em></p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>US health officials</strong> are discussing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef8daa94-c28e-4d43-ad11-4ad99c423524\">tightening mask guidance</a> for vaccinated Americans amid surging infections related to the Delta variant.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>German</strong> Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff has warned that coronavirus infections could spiral <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb004935-f8cc-4a10-9bbf-778678c05333\">in the coming month</a> and could trigger renewed restrictions on daily life for the unvaccinated.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Japanese </strong>company Shionogi started human trials of the first <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-pill-race-heats-up-as-japanese-firm-vies-with-pfizer-merck-11627205403\">once-a-day pill</a> to treat coronavirus patients.

Here's the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/085f4068-73d3-4b92-aecf-58662f85c80a\">full list</a>. </p> <h1>What else we're reading and watching</h1> <p><strong>Hawks vs doves: Fed divided over when to dial back economic support</strong> Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is facing a growing rift among top officials at the US central bank over when to start withdrawing the massive injection of monetary stimulus that was deployed at the onset of the pandemic. The debate is expected to intensify at this week's rate-setting meeting. Here's an introduction to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33e420c1-9220-49c0-bc06-105eb921dfd3\">the Fed's doves and the hawks</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can a new commodities boom revive Brazil?</strong> The South American nation is now riding a rally in commodity and raw material prices, as Covid-19 restrictions lift and worldwide growth returns. Yet how the commodities upswing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/841407cf-ee20-4b2d-ba06-70cc28c6f2a9\">plays out</a> will have an important bearing for the population of 213m Brazilians who have seen policymakers squander the opportunities of previous commodity booms.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Sicily, avocados and the future of food </strong>In some regions of the world, heat and drought are threatening certain crops, raising food security concerns. But in others, the warming climate and shifting seasons have allowed growers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/977fac14-49e0-4497-a435-6581e5792201\">cultivate new crops</a> that previously would have been difficult to produce profitably.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carlos Ghosn: the rise and fall of a superstar CEO</strong> A new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/45515fe8-3edc-42b1-8d92-dd5ff28ceeac\">FT film</a> tells the story of how Carlos Ghosn went from globetrotting industry titan, building the carmaking alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, to an international fugitive. It tracks the dizzying rise of ‘le cost cutter' and his stupendous fall, including interviews with industry executives and FT journalists. </p> <p><strong>Big headaches for Boeing as Dreamliner deliveries remain halted&#xa0;</strong>For the past two years Boeing has relied on its popular Dreamliner passenger jet to deliver sales after the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes.
