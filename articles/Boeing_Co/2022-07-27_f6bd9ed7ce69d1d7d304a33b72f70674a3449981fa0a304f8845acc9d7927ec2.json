  "title": "Boeing Profit Falls as Plane Maker Awaits Approval to Deliver Dreamliners; U.S. manufacturer has increased production and deliveries of its 737 MAX amid supplier bottlenecks",
  "text": "<p>\"Even as we navigate a difficult environment, we are making progress across key programs and are beginning to hit significant milestones,\" said Chief Executive David Calhoun in a message to employees Wednesday.</p><p>Boeing shares rose around 3% in early Wednesday trading.</p><p>Production of the 737 MAX has reached 31 planes a month, up from 16 a year ago, as it deals with supply-chain challenges such as engine shortages that are also affecting rival Airbus SE, which reports quarterly earnings later Wednesday. Boeing has said it stepped up 737 deliveries in June.</p><p>Executives have said they expect Boeing will soon receive regulatory approval to resume deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner. A series of production issues has kept the plane maker from handing over that jet to customers for much of the last two years, leaving it with more than $25 billion of the aircraft in inventory.</p><p>The company on Wednesday reported a profit of $160 million, or 32 cents a share, for the three months to June 30, down from $567 million, or $1, during the same period a year earlier.</p><p>The adjusted per-share loss of 37 cents, which excludes pension charges, fell short of the 13-cent loss consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Sales in the quarter fell 2% to $16.7 billion, with analysts expecting $17.6 billion.</p><p>Results of Arlington, Va.-based Boeing's defense business continued to be weighed down by charges. It booked a $93 million charge on its Starliner space capsule in the quarter. Boeing successfully launched the Starliner in May, but it has incurred higher costs after earlier failed attempts to launch and dock with the International Space Station. It also took a $147 million charge on its MQ-25 refueling drone as costs rose to meet requirements set by the U.S. Navy.</p><p>The company said it had positive operating cash flow in the second quarter. It reiterated the target of generating surplus cash for the full year.</p><p>Over the last couple of years, Boeing has dealt with production and regulatory problems that have impeded a recovery from two crises: a nearly two-year grounding of its 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and the pandemic's hit to demand for new aircraft.</p><p>A year ago, Mr. Calhoun expressed optimism, telling analysts in July 2021: \"We are turning a corner, and the recovery is gaining momentum.\"</p><p>More recently, Mr. Calhoun has said this year would mark a turning point. \"I can't measure it week by week or month by month or even quarter by quarter, but I know the year is going to be substantially better,\" he said at a June analyst event.</p><p>Boeing executives have said they are focused on stabilizing the company's operations. Airbus has been producing its A320 narrow-body family at a monthly rate of about 50 a month, with a goal of reaching 75 by 2025. But Mr. Calhoun, in his message to employees Wednesday, flagged supply constraints and inflation as potential barriers to ramping up. \"Even with demand high, we won't chase production rates or push our system too fast,\" he said.</p><p>Boeing has had to slow production of its narrow-body aircraft this year due to supply bottlenecks, and getting stored MAX jets out of inventory has taken longer than the company anticipated. Scores of the planes have been in storage since an earlier nearly two-year grounding following the two MAX crashes. Many of the MAX jets are bound for customers in China, which hasn't allowed the aircraft to return to service in the country.</p><p>The company has said it expected to deliver about 500 of 737 MAX jets by the end of the year. As of June 30, the company had handed over less than half that number to customers.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Profit Falls as Plane Maker Awaits Approval to Deliver Dreamliners</p>",
