  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Biden Visits Javelin Missile Plant --- Shortage of workers and supply-chain issues threaten to hinder factory output",
  "text": "<p>The company currently lists 26 vacancies at the Troy plant, including missile assemblers, quality supervisors and engineers.</p><p>Lockheed's search for workers highlights a challenge in America's response to supporting Ukraine and its allies: U.S. defense contractors want to boost weapons production, but finding workers for their arms factories isn't easy with unemployment levels at a 50-year low.</p><p>Javelin missiles, which can be launched by a single person, have proved crucial for Ukrainian forces in their fight to repel the Russian invasion.</p><p>More than 5,000 Javelin missiles have been transferred to Ukraine from the U.S. and nearly 500 more from allies and partners, according to the White House.</p><p>\"The skilled, the welders, the electricians, the pipe fitters, there's a shortage,\" said Hawk Carlisle, who recently stepped down as the president of the National Defense Industrial Association.</p><p>The trade group has warned about the combination of worker shortages and supply-chain kinks, given that each Javelin contains 250 computer chips. \"A surge of new demand when there is a positive output gap would likely result in production shortages, price inflation and a lack of investment in new productive capacity,\" it said in a January report on the defense industrial base.</p><p>Big defense companies such as Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co. last week reported lower quarterly sales and profits for the first three months of 2022. Most cited pandemic-driven supply-chain challenges, including worker shortages, that started to hit the sector toward the end of last year, many of which are expected to persist through 2022.</p><p>Lockheed's Troy plant opened in 1994 in the state's southeast corner and currently produces around 2,100 Javelins annually, according to U.S. Army budget records. It employs around 600 direct and contractor staff, of which 265 support Javelin production.</p><p>\"Being the arsenal of democracy also means good paying jobs for American workers in Alabama, in the states all across America, where defense equipment is manufactured and assembled,\" Mr. Biden said Tuesday.</p><p>Jim Taiclet, Lockheed's chief executive, said that though it has been awaiting contracts for fresh Javelin production, it was prepared to invest in hiring, tooling and potential supplier support.</p><p>\"For something this urgent, we're going to go ahead and invest in it ahead of need,\" he said at an event last week hosted by the Atlantic Council, a think tank.</p><p>The U.S. has enough Javelins in its own stocks for what the U.S. military needs, a senior defense official said Monday, but is interested in keeping the production line open for Ukraine.</p><p>\"We had not been buying them but we're working again with the contractor to see what has to be done to continue to keep that line going and open because it has proven to be an important piece of Ukraine's self-defense,\" the official said.</p><p>The Javelin supply chain has two dozen main members, including Lockheed's joint venture partner in the program, Raytheon Technologies Corp., which makes the missile control system in Tucson, Ariz.</p><p>Companies such as Lockheed tend to locate facilities producing munitions in more remote areas, in part because of the hazard associated with sensitive materials, which has also historically helped keep costs down.</p><p>---</p><p>Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.</p>",
