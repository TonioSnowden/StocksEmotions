  "title": "Boeing's Ex-Chief Plans Acquisition Vehicle  ----  By Andrew Tangel",
  "text": "<p>   Former Boeing Co. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, about a year after his ouster from the aerospace giant, is taking steps to re-enter American business with a special-purpose acquisition company. </p><p>   Mr. Muilenburg plans to raise $200 million for a SPAC seeking to merge with a private company in industries spanning space, defense, communications, advanced air mobility and logistics, according to a securities filing Monday. </p><p>   The filing said Mr. Muilenburg would be the CEO and chairman of New Vista Acquisition Corp. incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The company's directors and advisers would include former Boeing executives as well as former officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Air Force, according to the filing. </p><p>   Mr. Muilenburg didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday. Bloomberg News earlier reported Mr. Muilenburg's company filing. </p><p>   \"We believe that our broad industry focus will provide for many potential targets that could become attractive public companies as well as allow us to explore potential targets with a diverse set of business models and financial characteristics,\" the filing said. </p><p>   Mr. Muilenburg was Boeing's CEO from 2015 until the board ousted him in December 2019 as the company struggled through a crisis stemming from two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX airliner. </p><p>    A total of 346 people died in the two MAX accidents in late 2018 and early 2019. </p><p>   Global air-safety regulators grounded the aircraft, eventually forcing Boeing to halt production of the jet while it fixed a flight-control system blamed for the crashes. U.S. regulators approved the MAX to resume carrying passengers late last year. </p><p>   Mr. Muilenburg began his tenure at Boeing as an intern in 1985 and later oversaw its defense and space division before becoming CEO. </p><p>   Mr. Muilenburg's new company is based a few blocks from Boeing's headquarters in Chicago, according to the address listed in the securities filing. </p><p></p>",
