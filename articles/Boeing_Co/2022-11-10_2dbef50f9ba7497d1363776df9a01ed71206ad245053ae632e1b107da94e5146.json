  "title": "S&P, Nasdaq Stage Biggest Rally of the Year; Lower inflation sends stocks soaring as investors continue to track cryptocurrency turmoil, uncertainty over Senate control",
  "text": "<p>Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq were on pace for their biggest one-day gains since 2020.</p><p>For much of 2022, data on consumer-price increaseshas been bad news for markets. Inflation has proved stickier than many economists anticipated. That has forced the Fed to raise interest rates at the fastest pace in decades, causing bond yields to soar to multiyear highs and the stock market to slump.</p><p>But Thursday's report from the Labor Department offered rare relief to investors. The core consumer-price index—which excludes volatile energy and food prices—rose 6.3% in October from a year earlier, less than the 6.5% increase economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected and down from a 40-year high in September. Overall inflation was 7.7%, down from 8.2% in September.</p><p>The data gave investors fresh hope that the Fed, which is slated to move ahead with a half-percentage-point interest-rate increase next month, will moderate its pace of interest-rate increases in 2023.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested at a news conference last week that he wouldn't necessarily need to see a series of lower inflation readings—as many traders had previously thought—in order to support slowing the pace of rate increases. That gives Thursday's report significant weight for money managers who believe markets will be in the best position to stage a comeback when inflation peaks and the Fed is able to at least pause its rate hikes.</p><p>\"We believe that the stock and bond markets have found a bottom and we can rally off the lows,\" said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in emailed comments. Mr. Hatfield added that he believes inflation will ease even more next year, especially if energy prices continue to trade lower than where they were in the first quarter of 2022.</p><p>Others are less sure. Even with last month's moderation, inflation is still very high. Investors have also seen a version of this rally play out before—only for it to crumble apart. Stocks soared over the summer on bets that the Fed would pivot away from tightening monetary policy and shift from interest-rate increases to rate cuts as early as next year. But the gains were fleeting. Markets slumped in both August and September, weighed down by stern talk from Fed officials about the need to keep raising rates, as well as hotter-than-expected inflation data.</p><p>\"I can see a window where the market gets this kind of second false dawn, like we saw over the summer, where it gets excited about a peak Fed and peak inflation narrative,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.</p><p>Thursday's gains were broad, lifting stocks across all industries.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks lenders like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, rose 5.4%.</p><p>Shares of manufacturers, which are sensitive to changes in the economic outlook, jumped. Boeing rose 4.4% and 3M, the producer of goods like Scotch tape and safety equipment, added 3.6%.</p><p>Bonds rallied as well. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.856% from 4.149% Wednesday, on course for its biggest one-day pullback since at least 2009. Bond yields fall as prices rise.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies also got a break.</p><p>The fall from grace of FTX, previously one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, rippled across the digital currency and token markets this week. Crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday reversed course on a rescue offer for FTX, leaving the firm with an uncertain future.</p><p>Even with those headwinds, though, bitcoin rose to $17,725 after slumping Wednesday to less than $16,000. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase jumped 12%.</p><p>Analysts and investors say markets' path from here hinges heavily upon inflation and how that influences the Fed's policy trajectory.</p><p>Before the Fed's December announcement, traders will get another inflation reading from the Labor Department, as well as the monthly jobs report. The case for the Fed to raise interest rates by half a point next month instead of three-quarters of a point \"will still hinge on continued cooling\" in those two reports, Bank of America economists said in a note.</p><p>Still, traders seemed to already begin betting on less aggressive Fed policy for the months ahead. Federal funds futures showed the market pricing in a terminal rate—the highest level the Fed is expected to raise rates to—of around 4.87%, down from a little over 5% Wednesday, according to FactSet.</p><p>Overseas, markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 2.7%, reaching session highs after the release of U.S inflation data. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1%.</p><p>In politics, control of the Senate remained up for grabs, with contests in critical states too early to call and Georgia headed to a runoff.</p><p>Mr. Redha, of PineBridge Investments, said investors might cheer a return to divided government in the near term. But he said it could make it harder for lawmakers to respond to a potential recession next year.</p><p>Mr. Redha is still bracing for further declines in stock prices in the coming months because he thinks tighter monetary policy will push the U.S. economy into a downturn.</p><p>—Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P, Nasdaq Stage Biggest Rally of the Year</p>",
