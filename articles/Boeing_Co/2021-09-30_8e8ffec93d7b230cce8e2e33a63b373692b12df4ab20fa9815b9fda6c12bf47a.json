  "text": "<p>Wall Street is aiming to wrap up the last trading day of a volatile September and the final session of the third quarter, while investors look to parse testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who will speak before the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA declined 138 points, or 0.4%, lower to 34,257.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 indexSPX was flat at 4,360.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite IndexCOMP climbed 0.5% to 14,580, advancing by about 68 points.</p><p>For the month, the Dow was headed for a 2.4% decline, the S&amp;P 500 was down 3.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was off 4.3%. For the quarter, the Dow was flat, the S&amp;P 500 was up 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8%.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Sentiment on Thursday has been lifted by hopes that the government will avert a shutdown as a midnight deadline approaches for funding operations, but the upward momentum for the bulls seems fragile.</p><p>Congress was preparing Thursday to pass legislation extending government spending through Dec. 3 and avert a shutdown. That effort comes as the House aims to&#xa0;pass a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill&#xa0;already passed by the Senate but which may be in doubt as Democratic factions are threatening to block the bill unless moderate members sign on to supporting a separate, broader bill focused on climate change, education, and healthcare.</p><p>Against that backdrop, markets were likely to be choppy as they have for much of the past several weeks.</p><p>Investors were getting some help from bond yields that eased again with the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipping 1 basis point to around 1.53%. The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, which has been in the spotlight as it charged to its highest level in about a year was steadying at 94.28, at last check.</p><p>Investors will be digesting fresh comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, as he testifies to a House panel on COVID relief, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p><p>The Treasury Secretary at Thursday's hearing reiterated that a failure to raise the debt limit would have catastrophic implications for markets and the U.S. economy.</p><p>Several other government officials are set to speak Thursday, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.</p><p>On the data front, the number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits in late September rose to a two-month high, but much of the increase took place in California. New jobless claims paid traditionally by the states rose by 11,000 to 362,000 in the seven days ended Sept. 25,&#xa0;the government said Thursday.</p><p>Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had estimated new claims would total a seasonally adjusted 330,000.</p><p>“Though jobless claims ticked up yet again, weekly labor market data can be tricky to digest just because there is a lot of it and it's certainly bounced around a lot throughout the pandemic,” wrote Mike Loewengart, managing director investment strategy at E-Trade Financial, in emailed remarks.</p><p>“The end of Federal pandemic unemployment benefits earlier in the month also likely drove an increase in filings for state benefits. So the market may take this one piece of the data in stride as we wait for the reads next week, especially since the big ticket item right now is the debt ceiling,” Loewengart wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, an updated reading of second-quarter growth showed that the U.S. economy grew at a 6.7% annual pace, as the U.S. got a big jolt in the spring from government stimulus payments and coronavirus vaccines allowed businesses to reopen. The rise in consumer spending was slightly faster at 12% and exports were revised to show a 7.6% increase instead of 6.6%</p><p>Separately, a measure of business conditions in the Chicago region slipped in September to the lowest level in seven months, a trade group said Thursday. The Chicago Business Barometer,&#xa0;also known as the Chicago PMI,&#xa0;slowed to 64.7 in September from 66.8 in the prior month. The index has been moderating from a record high of 75.2 in May.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Virgin Galactic Holding Inc.SPCE shares are up 14%, after the space-tourism company announced the end of an&#xa0;Federal Aviation Administration probe into its test flight with founder Richard Branson on board.</p><p>CarMax Inc.KMX shares traded 11% lower after the car retailer reported a 4% drop in second-quarter net income to $1.72 a share, which fell short of Wall Street expectations.</p><p>Shares of BoeingBAwere down 1.5%, even as Bernstein analysts upgraded the company and Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc.&#xa0;SPR to outperform on Wednesday and said they expect international traffic and aircraft demand to start to improve as COVID-19 vaccines begin to be administered in most major markets.</p><p>Shares of Goldman Sachs were down by 1%, with the financial services company weighing on the Dow industrials, along with a 0.9% decline in home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. HD.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The 10-year Treasury noteBX:TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;was yielding 1.54% little changed from its Wednesday level.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was flat, holding at 94.319, the highest level in about a year.</p><p>Oil futures eased back, with the U.S. benchmark CL00 dropping 1.7% to $73.49 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent BRN00 declined 1.5% to $76.97.</p><p>In European equities, the Stoxx Europe 600 index XX:SXXP traded 0.2% lower and the FTSE 100 index UK:UKX pulled back 0.3%.
