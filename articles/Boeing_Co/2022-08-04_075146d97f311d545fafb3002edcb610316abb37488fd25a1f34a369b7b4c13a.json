  "title": "Business News:  Boeing  Machinists  Approve  Contract  ----  By Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   Workers at three Boeing Co. defense manufacturing plants on Wednesday voted in favor of a new contract, the company said, averting a potential strike. </p><p>   The plants produce weapons and military aircraft including the F-15 combat jet, the T-7A trainer and the MQ-25 refueling drone. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said last week that delivery delays would have been likely if workers took industrial action. </p><p>   The vote by around 2,500 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the St. Louis-area facilities follows their rejection of an earlier proposal last month. </p><p>   \"With the solidarity of our members we were able to secure an outstanding contract,\" said Tom Boelling, president of IAM District 837, which represents workers at the facilities. </p><p>   The union leadership had recommended members accept the revised Boeing offer. The new three-year contract offers new workers an $8,000 lump-sum payment and scraps earlier plans to cut company contributions to employees' 401(k) savings plans. </p><p>   Boeing said it welcomed the outcome of the vote. </p><p></p>",
