  "title": "GE to sell aircraft leasing business to AerCap in $30bn deal",
  "text": "<p>General Electric has agreed to sell its aircraft-leasing business to Irish rival AerCap in a more than $30bn deal that brings together the two biggest companies in the market. </p> <p>GE will receive $24bn of cash, a stake of 46 per cent in the combined company and $1bn of AerCap notes and cash when the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccd0e02c-57d9-49b7-b081-fbc7e8a25525\">deal</a> is completed. It will also be entitled to nominate two directors to AerCap's board.</p> <p>Once the deal has gone through, GE plans to cut its debt by about $30bn using the proceeds from the sale and existing cash resources. That will bring its total debt reduction to more than $70bn since the end of 2018. </p> <p>AerCap first began looking at a deal for GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) when the pandemic engulfed aviation a year ago, and is confident the industry will be able to rebound quickly, chief executive Aengus Kelly said. </p> <p>“Times of volatility are when&#xa0;you want to invest,” Kelly said.</p> <p>AerCap was in its strongest ever financial position before the pandemic and was attracted to the narrow-body fleet at GECAS, the part of the market expected to lead the recovery from the coronavirus crisis, he said. </p> <p>It is AerCap's second big deal under the Irish executive, who in 2013 agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corporation, a much larger competitor, from AIG.</p> <p>The combined company would dwarf its nearest rivals, prompting a warning about the loss of competition from the head of Iata, the global airline industry's trade body.</p> <p>“You have two aircraft manufacturers, you have two or three big [equipment manufacturers], monopolistic air traffic control, monopolistic airports and now we have monopolistic lessors,” Alexandre de Juniac told the Financial Times. “Lovely.”</p> <p>But Kelly said AerCap and GECAS are responsible for a “fraction” of global aircraft deliveries. The combined company's 2,000 jets would represent 7 per cent of the world's commercial fleet, according to analysts at Jefferies. </p> <p>The deal, which GE expects to take a year to win approval, could spark further consolidation, said Phil Seymour, president of aviation consultancy IBA.</p> <p>“It is a bit of a surprise . . . it would almost be like Boeing and Airbus merging,” he said. “I can imagine now the executives at those other lessors will be looking around thinking: how do they keep up with a mega lessor? Is there a need for more consolidation?”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Larry Culp, GE's chief executive, said the new company “will benefit from a stronger financial profile with a broader revenue base, stronger cash flows and greater customer diversification”.</p> <p>Leasing companies have helped finance the steep growth in air travel over the past 30 years but have suffered during the pandemic as airlines have deferred payments, cancelled orders and cut their fleets. </p> <p>The rollout of vaccines has raised hopes for a way out, with Kelly among those betting that airlines will be keen on the financial flexibility that leasing offers as they look to rebuild.</p> <p>“The objective of airlines will be to deleverage&#xa0;as fast as they can, it will most definitely not to be spending billions of dollars in Toulouse and Seattle,” the headquarters of Airbus and Boeing, Kelly said.</p> <p>Kelly has spoken to the chief executives of both aircraft manufacturers, who he said had been “extremely supportive”.</p> <p>Airbus said it “enjoys a close and long standing relationship with both AerCap and GECAS and will continue to do so through the merged entity”. Boeing declined to comment.</p> <p>For GE, the transaction is the latest step in Culp's financial de-risking strategy. The group already cut $16bn from its debt in 2020.</p> <p>“The strategic rationale of combining GECAS and AerCap looks pretty compelling,” said Dan Babkes, senior research analyst at Pzena Investment Management, which owned about 90m GE shares at the end of last year.</p> <p>GECAS was the largest remaining unit of GE Capital, which had ballooned into the world's largest nonbank finance company before what former GE chief executive Jeff Immelt called the “near-death experience” of the financial crisis.</p> <p>GE began dismantling GE Capital more than a decade ago, but Immelt recalled in a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a64c4356-a42e-4883-acdb-13ced2bdcaea\"> recent memoir</a> that it kept GECAS because the business was more international.</p> <p>Aviation has been hit hardest of all GE's units by the pandemic. GECAS revenues dropped by $1bn to just under $4bn in 2020, with non-cash impairment charges driving it to a reported loss of $786m for the year.</p> <p>AerCap lost $315m in 2020, compared with a profit of $1.34bn the previous year.</p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis, Sylvia Pfeifer and Oliver Barnes in London and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York 2021 'GE to sell aircraft leasing business to AerCap in $30bn deal' FT.com 10 March.
