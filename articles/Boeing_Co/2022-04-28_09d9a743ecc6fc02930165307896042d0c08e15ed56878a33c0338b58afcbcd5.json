  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is the U.S. doing enough to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Military spending is set to rise, with the Biden administration requesting $773 billion for the Pentagon's next financial year, but the military is still running short of some weapons widely used in Ukraine.</p><p>Defense-company executives say they are ready to increase production of most weapons, but some experts say the Pentagon has only just begun issuing new contracts that would be required to replace some of the weaponry sent overseas.</p><p>\"Industry really can't do a lot until they have their contracts in hand,\" said Bill Greenwalt, a former Pentagon official who managed the military's industrial policy and is now a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \"We are still in that limbo phase.\"</p><p>The Pentagon has sent more than $3.7 billion worth of military goods from existing stockpiles to Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion, from heavy artillery and tactical drones, to shoulder-fired Stingers and Javelins. But so far, the Pentagon has issued only one new contract, for Puma drones. A Pentagon official last week said the military was working to get others issued soon.</p><p>One of the challenges to boosting production is that the military-industrial base is smaller than it once was. Years of budget cuts and industry consolidation has left the U.S. with just two producers of missile rocket motors. That is down from six in 1995, while the number of companies' sub-suppliers has shrunk to 1,000 from about 5,000, according to the Government Accountability Office.</p><p>Raytheon Technologies Corp., the Pentagon's second-largest supplier and maker of Javelins and Stingers, said Tuesday that a rocket motor shortage could stretch into next year.</p><p>Chief Executive Greg Hayes said the Pentagon hasn't bought new Stingers for almost two decades. While it reopened the Stinger production line for an overseas customer last year, it had to redesign some parts that are no longer produced.</p><p>\"That's going to take us a little bit of time,\" said Mr. Hayes on an investor call.</p><p>Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer under the Trump administration, said the U.S. had already sent a quarter of its Stinger stocks to Ukraine. The Pentagon said it has so far earmarked around 1,400 Stingers for Ukraine.</p><p>More on the War in Ukraine</p><p>Inside the Russian Siege of Mariupol</p><p>\"We have a problem with the government not paying to maintain production capacity,\" Ms. Lord, now a senior adviser at The Chertoff Group, a security risk consultant, said Tuesday at a Congressional hearing. It could take two to five years to increase production and replenish supplies being sent to Ukraine, she said.</p><p>Industry representatives say the issues raised by the war in Ukraine and the expected need to surge production capacity require the government and Congress to think more broadly about industrial strategy.</p><p>\"All of this points to the need to think of the defense industrial base as a capability in and of itself in which we need to invest,\" said Eric Fanning, president and chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association, in Arlington Va. \"We need to be investing in it in a sustained way so it's there when we need it to surge.\"</p><p>Bill LaPlante, who started April 15 as the Pentagon's new chief arms buyer, said at a confirmation hearing last month that his priority was to speed the flow of supplies to Ukraine and have production lines ready to surge output. \"I believe we need multiple hot production lines,\" he said, citing munitions and drones.</p><p>The drawdown of U.S. stockpiles and lack of replacement production has begun to attract the attention of lawmakers.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said last week he was open to invoking the Defense Production Act to spur weapons output for Ukraine, reprising the directives that helped two years ago to push some defense companies to pivot and produce pandemic-related supplies.</p><p>\"The pressure is on,\" said Mr. Durbin, who added that he was in regular contact on the matter with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p><p>The Pentagon is looking at the Defense Production Act and other legal mechanisms \"to determine whether they are applicable or prudent, and is applying those authorities as needed to help replenish stockpiles in the most efficient manner,\" said a Pentagon spokeswoman.</p><p>Speaking Wednesday at the Pentagon, department spokesman John Kirby said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke about industrial-base issues the previous day with his counterparts at the Ukraine Security Consultative Group meeting in Ramstein, Germany. The U.S., Kirby said, is looking at its defense industrial base and is also asking allies to look at their own to determine \"the degree to which there might need to be changes in terms of production of certain systems or not, or accelerations or not.\"</p><p>To date, almost all the shipments of weapons to Ukraine have come from existing stocks, according to the Pentagon. Officials have emphasized that the transfers to Ukraine haven't affected U.S. military readiness.</p><p>Lockheed Martin Corp. said last week that while it was in talks with the Pentagon, it hasn't increased production of any of the weapons being sought by Ukraine. Lockheed, the world's largest defense company by sales, produces the Javelin in a joint venture with Raytheon.</p><p>Jay Malave, Lockheed's chief financial officer, said the company was evaluating requests from the Pentagon to raise output of equipment, but he did not specify which ones. He said fulfilling the orders has been complicated by the pandemic-driven supply chain issues that started to affect defense companies in the final quarter of last yearâ€”later than most manufacturers.</p><p>The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than 5,500 Javelins, but won't doesn't disclose how many are left in its inventory. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates the Pentagon has used around a third of its stock.</p><p>The Pentagon declined to comment on how many Stingers and Javelins were currently in U.S. stockpiles.</p><p>The Defense Department will issue new contracts \"as quickly as possible, consistent with existing laws and policies,\" the Pentagon spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><p>Part of the issue is that while the U.S. has Stingers and Javelins in its arsenal, the weapons are rarely used by the U.S. on the battlefield, limiting demand for new ones, officials said. The Pentagon has in recent years directed more funding toward higher-end weapons designed to tackle China's military expansion often at the expense of older, simpler systems like the Javelin, said industry experts.</p><p>Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc., which makes rocket motors for the Javelin and Stinger, said it could increase production, but was waiting for the Pentagon to order more. The company, which is in the midst of a proxy board battle, declined to comment on Raytheon's assertion that industry could take months to raise output.</p><p>Other defense suppliers, such as AeroVironment Inc., which makes the armed Switchblade drones being supplied to Ukraine, have cited shortages of high-end semiconductors.</p><p>At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said semiconductor shortages were constraining the ability of U.S. military contractors to supply weapons to Ukraine. \"I talked to all the national defense contractors recently, who are working overtime in the Ukraine replenishment issue and their biggest pain point is chips,\" she said. \"There are 250 chips or more in every Javelin launching system.\"</p><p>The Pentagon, in an apparent nod to concerns about the industrial base, said last week it was diversifying its supplies of armed drones being sent to Ukraine, with more than 100 recently developed Phoenix Ghosts slated to join the Switchblades already being dispatched.</p><p>The agency has also reached out to some defense companies to discuss boosting production. On April 12, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks alongside Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter convened a meeting of top defense-industry CEOs to discuss the issue.</p><p>Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. L3Harris Technologies Inc., and the U.S. arm of BAE Systems PLC were among those who attended, according to the Pentagon.</p><p>David Berteau, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, an Arlington, Va., trade association representing government contractors, said at a congressional hearing Tuesday that efforts should have been made six years ago to prime the missile supply chain.</p><p>\"We're behind,\" said Mr. Berteau, a former Pentagon official in charge of logistics during the Obama administration, \"and you guys should push them.\"</p><p>Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Efforts to Arm Ukraine Shine Light on Limited Production Lines</p>",
