  "text": "<p>Evidence of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73eba78a-1bdb-4b32-be3e-b0329470b946\">a new wave of Covid-19 deaths</a> is beginning to emerge in Beijing despite official tallies showing no fatalities since an uncontrolled outbreak began sweeping through China's capital of 22mn inhabitants this week.</p> <p>Staff at one crematorium in Beijing said they cremated the bodies of at least 30 Covid victims on Wednesday and Financial Times reporters saw two body bags at a special hospital designated for coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bc62132-e17f-4b36-aad1-c68c0eff20a5\">was warned this week</a> that Covid-19 deaths could reach close to 1mn across the country unless there is a rapid roll out of booster shots and antiviral drugs. The report, part-funded by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, also called for the reimposition of social distancing. </p> <p>President Xi Jinping this month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0c2f6fa-7164-4cf5-80ad-db029a5b66de\">abandoned his zero-Covid strategy</a> of mass testing, quarantines, citywide lockdowns and fastidious electronic contact tracing after countrywide demonstrations against the draconian policy. The decision has unleashed China's biggest uncontrolled wave of coronavirus cases since the pandemic started in Wuhan nearly three years ago.</p> <p>But Chinese officials have not reported any Covid-related deaths in the country since December 4.</p> <p>The latest surge of cases is pushing the healthcare system to its limits, with medical workers in Beijing asked to remain on the job even if they are infected.</p> <p>One Beijing resident, Wei Yansu, said her grandmother died this week in neighbouring Hebei province, four days after being diagnosed with Covid.</p> <p>“She was infected during this wave of outbreak and it caused a cerebral infarction,” Wei said.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> In recent days FT reporters have seen evidence of Covid deaths at Beijing hospitals and spoken with staff at crematoria and nursing homes. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7da5e8af-3d15-40dd-ac63-e4e48cbb7eda\">Read their full report. </a></p></li> </ul> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Global</strong> <strong>stock</strong> <strong>markets tumble </strong>The ECB, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank were among central banks yesterday to follow the Federal Reserve and raise their borrowing costs by half a percentage point. But it was the hawkish commentary around the interest rate announcements <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c12545c-44b1-472a-8139-3863887ff6c6\">that spooked investors</a>. The S&amp;P 500 index fell 2.5 per cent, its biggest daily loss since early November, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2 per cent. In Europe, the broad Stoxx 600 fell 2.8 per cent, its biggest loss since May.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Elon Musk suspends US journalists' Twitter accounts</strong> The accounts of several high-profile US journalists <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/650c7999-7f11-4201-9c0f-751e86e901df\">have been suspended</a> by Elon Musk's Twitter, with the billionaire suggesting that they fell foul of a recently created policy on sharing location information. They include Ryan Mac of the New York Times, Donie O'Sullivan of CNN and Drew Harwell of the Washington Post who reported on the deletion of ElonJet, a Twitter account set up by Jack Sweeney, a 20-year-old US student, that was sharing publicly available data on the whereabouts of Musk's private jet.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Japan scraps pacifist postwar defence strategy</strong> Japan is to overturn six decades of postwar security policy and arm itself <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1180f72c-b7aa-48cc-817b-69e7400fc6d3\">with one of the world's largest defence budgets</a> to counter “an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge” posed by China's rising military aggression. In a new national security strategy released today, its first in almost a decade, Tokyo laid out its ambitions to play a more active role in regional security. The new policy is likely to draw a strong response from China.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Russian crude being shipped to India under G7 price cap</strong> Russian crude oil is being shipped to India on tankers insured by western companies, according to Financial Times analysis of shipping and insurance records, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41237fe7-210d-406c-a22a-2e17a79f7381\">in the first sign</a> Moscow has reneged on its vow to block sales under the G7-imposed price cap. The FT has also found evidence of Russian oil <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41e47ba2-3e3b-414b-905b-df4336f22bed\">being shipped to North Korea</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Virgin Atlantic to test first transatlantic net zero flight</strong> A Boeing 787 will take off next year from London and fly to New York <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6e69dd3-70f0-4c29-a0b3-cbdc90d3edad\">powered only by sustainable aviation fuel</a>, the UK government has said. The planned flight will be a milestone for the aviation industry and one that it hopes will encourage greater investment in developing sustainable aviation fuel. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine will lead to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/017c9e1e-3069-4bf3-8335-f1404abd6eb0\">the record use of coal</a> this year, according to the International Energy Agency.</p> <h1>The days ahead</h1> <p><strong>Market outlook</strong> European stock markets are lower and futures trading indicates there will be losses on Wall Street <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b39672fc-a60d-4cb2-bb3b-f659ea7d8ad1\">when trading begins</a> as investors continue to digest this week's comments from the world's leading central banks. Today is also so-called Quadruple Witching Day, when in the final hour of stock market trading, index futures, index options, stock options and single-stock futures all expire, adding to volatility.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> S&amp;P Global is expected to report its flash manufacturing PMI data remained unchanged at 47.7 in December. Services flash and composite PMI for December is likely to be 46.8 and 47.0, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Company earnings</strong> Professional services firm Accenture is expected to report a 4 per cent rise in first-quarter revenue, its lowest level since 2021, due to weakness in consulting projects as clients look to conserve cash in an uncertain economic environment. Analysts will expect commentary on the outlook for client spends and headcount. </p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco president Mary Daly will participate in a virtual conversation, “Inflation, the Economy and the Federal Reserve” <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/events/inflation-the-economy-and-the-federal-reserve-a-conversation-with-san-francisco-federal-reserve-president-mary-daly/\">hosted by the American Enterprise Institute</a>.</p> <p><strong>Leo Varadkar's comeback</strong> Ireland's first openly gay premier will once again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f971553-c67a-468b-9ff1-71b3e730ce45\">take the helm of the government</a> on Saturday ahead of 2025 elections. Outgoing taoiseach Micheál Martin will hand over power as part of a 2020 coalition agreement.</p> <p><strong>World Cup </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07163dc6-2899-49b7-8d33-163b0dc06dce\">Lionel Messi's Argentina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4836ae85-f25e-41d8-a1d4-c98fdd19fd8a\">Antoine Griezmann's France</a> battle it out in the final on Sunday.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Gideon Rachman, the FT's foreign affairs commentator, has been in Qatar to follow England. He has been to every World Cup, bar one, since 1994 and asks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71a661c9-3e2d-4091-b3e7-c0f69ba31073\">is it still the greatest show on earth?</a></p></li> </ul> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>How Putin's technocrats saved the Russian economy</strong> Once thought of as reformers, Russian president Vladimir Putin's economic confidants have become his enablers. Despite their initial opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, they have used their expertise and tools to soften the blow of western sanctions and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe5fe0ed-e5d4-474e-bb5a-10c9657285d2\">hold Russia's wartime economy together</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why has Big Tech fallen in love with exchanges?</strong> This week's announcement of Microsoft's partnership with the London Stock Exchange comes after Google signed a 10-year cloud computing agreement with CME and Amazon Web Services agreed a similar deal with New York's Nasdaq. For the exchanges, the product and data advantages are clear. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ffa049-cf19-45ec-aaf6-36adc613412e\">But what is in it for the tech groups</a>?</p> <p><strong>Struggling cinema operators pin hopes on new Avatar movie</strong> The sequel to the highest-grossing film of all time opens this weekend and cinema operators are hoping it will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c88cec10-c130-474b-9cf6-eaf6ac17c1f5\">prove a draw with movie-goers</a>. But <em>The Way of Water</em>, filmed in 3D and clocking in at more than three hours, is one of only five planned film releases this month as the industry tries to salvage another difficult year.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Review:</strong> The FT's cinema critic Danny Leigh gave the new James Cameron film three stars. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ead4f2f2-c31a-4f7a-b92a-e012aa34d932\">Read his full review</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Grassroots support for Donald Trump starts to crack after midterms</strong> A month after Donald Trump launched his third presidential campaign his attempt to recapture the White House <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79f5d634-cd41-4077-8ddb-e44a562c5aad\">is floundering</a>. Two polls this week showed support for his rival Ron DeSantis is growing, evidence the former president is paying the price for the Republican party's poor performance in the midterms.</p> <p><strong>Inside China's intelligence operation </strong>Much has been written in recent years about China's espionage, writes Demetri Sevastopulo, but Alex Joske's <em>Spies and Lies</em> goes inside China's intelligence operation to distil huge amounts of open-source information on Beijing's Ministry of State Security. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d98af531-6227-4666-aac5-cc286d2ae413\">Read Demetri's full review of the book here</a>.</p> <h1>Your chance to have lunch with the FT</h1> <p>Lunch with the FT editor and eight journalists is up for auction to support the Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign charity, part of the organisation's war on financial illiteracy.
