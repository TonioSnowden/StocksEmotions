  "title": "Boeing Starliner Set to Return After Flight to International Space Station; Spacecraft is expected to land in New Mexico just before 7 p.m ET on Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>During its flight to the orbiting research facility, the Starliner completed a series of maneuvers to demonstrate its capabilities, and NASA and the company have been collecting data about how it operates. \"This is a really critical demonstration mission,\" Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for space operations at NASA, said at a briefing Friday after the docking.</p><p>Finishing the flight would set the stage for a launch of the Starliner with astronauts on board, though teams from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Boeing plan further analysis of several technical issues that have emerged on the current test flight.</p><p>Before docking with the station space last week, two thrusters the Starliner uses for orbital maneuvers failed, but a third functioned as expected, allowing the vehicle to complete an important maneuver. Boeing has said that a drop in pressure caused the two thrusters to fail.</p><p>A couple of other, smaller thrusters also shut down during the flight, NASA program manager Steve Stich said Friday. In addition, devices that cool the vehicle didn't function as anticipated, but teams were able to manage the issue, he added.</p><p>Mark Nappi, a Boeing vice president overseeing the Starliner program, said the company expected to learn a lot from the test mission and incorporate lessons into future flights and how it develops the spacecraft.</p><p>\"We're very satisfied by what we've learned, how the team has reacted to it, and how the vehicle has responded to some of these items,\" he said on Friday.</p><p>NASA in 2014 hired Boeing and Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to develop crew vehicles for astronaut missions to the space station and back, and wants to have two U.S. providers in place to handle such flights. SpaceX has launched five such crewed missions for the agency.</p><p>Boeing first tried to send one of its Starliner vehicles to the research facility in late 2019, but the aerospace giant struggled with a software error that stranded the vessel in the wrong orbit. The vehicle didn't make it to the space station during that operation.</p><p>Last August, the makeup flight was scrapped because multiple valves in the Starliner's propulsion system became stuck. Boeing and NASA spent months investigating that problem, and the company made changes to prevent the issue from occurring again. Executives have said Boeing may redesign the valve system as a longer-term fix.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Starliner Set to Return After Flight to International Space Station</p>",
