  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX gained 66 points, or 1.5%, at 4,423.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA climbed 381 points, or 1.1%, to reach 34,678.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was rising 2%, or about 265 points, to roughly 13,802.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow industrials fell 66.77 points, or 0.2%, to close at 34,297.73.

Goldman Sachs says the bull market will continue.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Investors have been whipsawed by recent volatility in equity markets, driven by disappointment over corporate earnings so far this quarter, tension between Russia and NATO over Ukraine, COVID-19 worries and, most of all, apprehension over the extent of Fed monetary policy tightening to come.</p><p>“Yesterday, major U.S. indices went from tears to laughter then back to tears, again,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, in a note to clients. “As such, seeking a dip has become a difficult exercise, and the strong corporate results have a little impact on the market's bad faith these days.”</p><p>Fears over tighter Fed policy have been reflected in the Nasdaq, down 13% this month.

On the contrary, a deep dive in the financial markets would only refrain the&#xa0;Fed&#xa0;from doing what it's got to do and worsen inflation,” added Ozkardeskaya.</p><p>Data released Tuesday showed slippage in consumer confidence, on the back of rising prices and the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>Investors are sifting through a fresh batch of earnings, with a busy after-hours calendar as well, as Tesla, Intel INTC, Whirlpool WHR and Xilinx XLNX are all due to report.</p><p>Microsoft MSFT sales topped $50 billion for the first time in its fiscal second quarter, as it reported earnings late Tuesday. Stocks initially fell, then rebounded after the company's strong revenue forecast for the current quarter. Shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Microsoft stock's post-earnings roller-coaster ride won't be the last</p><p>The standoff between Russia and Western powers continued, amid concerns Moscow is planning an imminent invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The Russian government warned Wednesday it would turn to “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands and continue “aggressive” policies.”</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Texas Instruments Inc. shares TXN jumped 3.3% after the chip group's earnings topped Wall Street expectations. </p><p>AT&amp;T Inc.T stock rose 0.5% after the telecommunications topped earnings expectations.</p><p>Boeing Co.'s stock BA was last off 2.4% despite the aircraft maker reporting a much bigger-than-expected loss and hefty revenue miss.</p><p>Tesla Inc.TSLA stock rallies 2.8%, following a 7.8% drop from a three-day losing stream through Tuesday. Tesla will report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday.</p><p>Mattel Inc.MAT shares rose nearly 9% after The Wall Street Journal reported, citing company executives, that the toy maker had won back the rights to produce toys based on film characters from rival Hasbro Inc.
