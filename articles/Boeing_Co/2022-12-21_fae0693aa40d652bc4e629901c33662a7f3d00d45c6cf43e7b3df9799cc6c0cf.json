  "title": "U.S. News: Boeing Gets Waiver On 737 MAX Cutoff",
  "text": "<p>The provision contained in the omnibus bill instead would require some safety enhancements, though short of what current law would require, on all 737 MAX jets to be made pending certification by U.S. air-safety regulators.</p><p>The House and Senate are expected to vote on the legislation before the current lame-duck Congress finishes its session. The Dec. 27 deadline was imposed by a 2020 law aimed at making new aircraft safer after two MAX jets crashed, taking 346 lives.</p><p>Boeing's earlier push to get lawmakers to attach a MAX waiver to a defense bill faltered. Without a reprieve from Congress, the latest 737 MAX jets face an unclear path. The Federal Aviation Administration had said it would stop evaluating Boeing's submissions related to the jets' current cockpit-alerting systems \"in accordance with our congressional mandate.\" The jets need FAA certification before they can fly with passengers.</p>",
