  "title": "Biden Picks Denver Airport Chief to Lead Federal Aviation Administration; If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Phil Washington would lead the air-safety regulator as it faces challenges with travel disruptions, safety oversight",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Washington couldn't immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.</p><p>If confirmed by the Senate to run the FAA, Mr. Washington would confront multiple challenges, including recent widespread air-traffic disruptions as airlines struggle to meet surging demand for flights, and improving the agency's oversight of aviation safety after two Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>The FAA, under pressure from Congress, has been tightening its scrutiny of Boeing and other aerospace manufacturers following the MAX crashes, which took place in Indonesia and Ethiopia and claimed 346 lives. Those accidents tarnished the FAA's reputation as a global flight-safety regulator. Since then, the agency has adopted a stiffer posture with Boeing on various aircraft certification matters.</p><p>Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia, said Mr. Washington's public-sector experience might help him protect the agency from industry influence and improve its safety oversight.</p><p>While he said he didn't know enough about Mr. Biden's pick to lead the FAA, Mr. Stumo said: \"It's possible that an outsider could be a plus.\"</p><p>In addition to handling air-traffic control and oversight of plane makers, the FAA is responsible for regulating commercial space launches, setting rules for drone operations and licensing pilots, among other tasks.</p><p>This year the agency has faced challenges with busy airline flight schedules, weather disruptions and, according to airlines, staffing challenges at some of the agency's air-traffic-control facilities. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said this week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the majority of cancellations and delays haven't been driven by air-traffic-control issues.</p><p>Mr. Washington was confirmed in his current role at the Denver airport in July of last year, but the Chicago native has spent most of his career leading agencies that are focused on surface transportation, like buses and passenger rail service. His experience in the Army is seen as helpful in leading large, complicated organizations such as the FAA, according to industry officials who know Mr. Washington.</p><p>The FAA has been run by safety chief Billy Nolen, a former American Airlines Group Inc. pilot and executive focused on regulatory and safety matters, on an acting basis since the last permanent administrator, Steve Dickson, stepped down from the job at the end of March.</p><p>Todd Hauptli, chief executive of the American Association of Airport Executives, said he knows Mr. Washington to be an incisive, thoughtful and gifted leader of complex transportation organizations. \"The FAA assignment is no easy task, but given the chance, he will more than meet the challenge,\" Mr. Hauptli said.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Picks Denver Airport Chief to Lead Federal Aviation Administration</p>",
