  "text": "<p>\n  KIMBERLY HAMMONDS </p><p>\n  1967-2022 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Kimberly Hammonds hopscotched through a career with executive posts involving increasing responsibilities for technology at Ford Motor Co., Dell Inc., Boeing Co. and Deutsche Bank AG. </p><p>\n  In her mid-30s, breast cancer disrupted what looked like steady progress toward a chief executive appointment. \"I felt like somebody was basically laying me on the floor and saying you now need to pay attention to what's important . . . not everything's about the career,\" she said in a video interview. She began pondering how she would be remembered. </p><p>\n  A hospital volunteer introduced her to art therapy. Painting distracted her from the torments of chemotherapy. She began looking forward to hospital art sessions. </p><p>\n  Ms. Hammonds decided that her legacy would be the Zoe Foundation, founded in 2004 and named after her daughter, providing art therapy for cancer patients. </p><p>\n  After she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in April 2019, she raised about $1.8 million for the foundation and assigned friends to carry on with fundraising work. </p><p>\n  Over the past few years, Ms. Hammonds served as a director of companies including Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Box Inc. She was attending board meetings via remote links until a few days before she died on June 28 at her home on Anna Maria Island in Florida. She was 55 years old. </p><p></p>",
