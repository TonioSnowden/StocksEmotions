  "text": "<p><em>Happy Friday. How well did you keep up with the news this week? Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-06-18/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>The “reflation trade” that has dominated financial markets since the emergence of coronavirus vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fa0c907-f597-49b2-a08d-35249d1d5a9f\">has been pummelled</a> after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly signalled this week a shift in its stance on inflation.</p> <p>Commodity prices tumbled yesterday, while the dollar and long-dated US government bond prices raced higher, after the Fed reacted to unexpectedly strong inflation data by moving forward its guidance on when it might start raising interest rates.</p> <p>Natural resources suffered the biggest hit, with Bloomberg's commodity price index tumbling 3.6 per cent, its biggest one-day drop in more than a year, with WTI oil falling 1.5 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>So-called US value stocks — often cheaper, out-of-favour companies that are more sensitive to the pace of economic growth — fell another 1.3 per cent to extend the initial drop they suffered on Wednesday.</p> <p>The dollar is on course <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fa14ef2-edc0-41bb-870c-303542d6e7c8\">for its best week</a> since last September, while gold is headed for its worst in 15 months.</p> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>US Supreme Court throws out challenge to Obamacare</strong> The US Supreme Court has dismissed the latest Republican challenge to the Affordable Care Act, preserving Barack Obama's flagship healthcare reforms in a win for Democrats. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1344c170-7e5d-4f43-b3a7-b01ca61b6954\">7-2 opinion</a> denied an attempt to invalidate the sweeping Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a42f40fd-d597-432d-aeca-3457bebe8559\">pressure is growing</a> on Supreme Court judge Stephen Breyer, 82, to retire and make way for a Joe Biden appointment.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>General dismisses warnings of imminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan</strong> General Mark Milley, America's most senior general, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f68c3fdf-5f3b-4cd3-9fcf-03b7a19ea7ee\">has dismissed warnings</a> of an imminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan, insisting that the People's Liberation Army was not yet capable of annexing the island. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>ByteDance revenues more than doubled in 2020</strong> The owner of the short-video apps TikTok and Douyin recorded a surge in users last year as coronavirus lockdowns across the world left people searching for more entertainment online. ByteDance revenues increased 111 per cent to $34bn as it recorded an annual gross profit of $19bn, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c10ed57-16b6-43f9-882d-d2cb9837fdc7\">according to people familiar with the matter</a>.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Starbucks' European unit pays $183m to US owner</strong> Profits at Starbucks' European business fell almost 40 per cent to $104m in the year to September 2020, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31730d15-fc9e-4522-a36e-81397b3728ea\">according to company calculations</a> that aggregated the accounts of its franchise businesses across continental Europe and the Middle East. Still, the coffee chain paid $183m in dividends to its US parent company despite suffering its first dip in growth in two decades.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>UK and US settle long-running Airbus-Boeing trade dispute</strong> The UK has reached a truce with the US in a long-running dispute over commercial aircraft subsidies for Airbus and Boeing, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2685a2f-580a-4386-a7bf-fcc42fc369ea\">agreeing to a five-year suspension</a> of punitive tariffs on a wide range of goods including Scotch whisky and Stilton cheese.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>CureVac's </strong>chief financial officer said the company had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ce1ceae-25f7-4ced-b39f-f8010548c1b3\">not given up</a> on its coronavirus vaccine, despite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0309b8ae-bae8-42ce-99e9-d487cd43899c\">disappointing</a> trial results.</p></li>  <li><p>Retail sales in <strong>Great Britain</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16083c9f-a0a8-4920-9eed-3e396838cec3\">unexpectedly fell</a> in May for the first time since January, as people spent more on hospitality and less on grocery shopping in the wake of lockdown restrictions easing.</p></li>  <li><p>Nurses and supermarket staff are seen as “key workers”.
