  "text": "<p>Military contractors said they are experiencing staffing issues that labor experts expect to percolate through the wider economy. The companies said an aging pool of specialized workers, especially engineers with security clearance, hasn't returned as they did after previous downturns.</p><p>Weapons makers, which are typically working now on orders received two, three or even five years ago, are gearing up for higher demand driven by the conflict in Ukraine and China's military buildup.</p><p>The U.S. has committed more than $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including Javelin and Stinger missiles, drones and radios. The Pentagon said most of this is coming from existing U.S. stockpiles, and industry executives don't expect the impact of new equipment sales to come until next year.</p><p>The U.S. defense budget, which just a year ago had been expected to be flat through 2025, is rising. A host of European companies have committed to boosting budgets in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.</p><p>Greg Hayes, Raytheon's chief executive, said it was caught flat-footed when staff furloughed at the start of the pandemic didn't return in the numbers expected, and a hoped-for improvement following the Omicron variant failed to materialize. \"It is a hill to climb in the back half of the year,\" Mr. Hayes said on an investor call. While Raytheon and its suppliers typically secured 75% of those they had furloughed, this time only a quarter had returned. A recession that cools the jobs market may be the quickest fix, he said.</p><p>Companies have increased the number of job fairs to recruit new workers, in addition to bolstering pay and benefits, executives said.</p><p>Almost 90,000 workers were laid off or furloughed when rolling shutdowns closed factories across the country in early 2020, according to the Aerospace Industries Association, but by mid-2021 companies started to hire back workers. Many didn't return, said some company executives.</p><p>The Omicron variant exacerbated the situation early this year. \"It's crazy. We have had people accept the job and then never show up,\" said Jeff Kaney, CEO of Kaney Aerospace Inc. in Rockford, Ill. Kaney Aerospace makes gears and motors for Airbus, Boeing and other big contractors supplying the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>When President Biden in May visited the Lockheed plant in Troy, Ala., that assembles Javelin missiles, it had 25 advertised vacancies, according to the company. That number has remained unchanged despite the publicity from the visit and the company's own efforts to bolster hiring.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
