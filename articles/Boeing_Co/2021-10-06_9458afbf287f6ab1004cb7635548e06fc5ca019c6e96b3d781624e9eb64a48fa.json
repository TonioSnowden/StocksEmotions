  "text": "<p>Boeing sees aviation growth regaining height after losing two years to Covid with the US company issuing a 20-year forecast of 43,610 deliveries (“Altitude check: Boeing sees aviation regaining height after losing two years' growth to Covid”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a4eec2-2af0-4c90-aa84-96f9019bd302\">Report</a>, September 15). </p> <p>That means aeroplanes using current designs — or optimised versions of them — will still be heading skyward in 2042 with more in the following years, absent any major design change. Since the average life of a passenger aircraft is 20 years, the last of those will be in use until 2062 and onwards. In 1965, I flew on an earlier version — a Boeing 707 — from Britain to Australia. Today's versions fly slower to save fuel. </p> <p>So the smartphone in our pockets today goes 32,600 times faster than the Nasa computer that put man on the moon in the late 1960s. But given the proven pace of change in the aircraft industry, aviation may regain height but it will never regain the speed it achieved in the 1960s. By which time I shall look down from a much higher height with sympathy for the unfortunates forced to travel around the globe on those flying dinosaurs. </p> <p><strong>James Hanshaw</strong> <br><em>Zurich, Switzerland</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Boeing's boast looks like pie in the sky' FT.com 6 October.
