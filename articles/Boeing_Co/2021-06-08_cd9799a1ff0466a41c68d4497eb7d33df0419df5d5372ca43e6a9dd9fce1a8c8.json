  "text": "<p>Boeing is trying to renegotiate the cut-price deal it agreed to supply two Air Force One planes to the White House, a government official revealed on Tuesday, saying it needs an extra year to deliver the jets.</p> <p>The aircraft maker signed a $3.9bn fixed-price contract in 2018, after then-president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f50983b2-bbc7-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080\">Donald Trump called</a> the original estimate of $5bn “ridiculous”, writing on Twitter: “cancel order”.</p> <p>But the contract has run into difficulty. The scale of the problem became clearer thanks to congressional testimony on Tuesday from Darlene Costello, principal deputy-assistant secretary for Air Force acquisition.</p> <p>She told the House of Representatives armed services subcommittee on sea power and projection that Boeing had cited supplier trouble and Covid-19 to ask for a one-year extension on the contract.</p> <p>The planes were supposed to be ready in 2024.</p> <p>Costello also said the Chicago-based manufacturer had sent the government a letter of intent asking to increase the payment on the contract — what is known as a “request for equitable adjustment”.</p> <p>Boeing's letter of intent was the first step in requesting to increase the programme's price tag, Costello said. “Then we start that negotiation process.”</p> <p>The company's trouble with the programme <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6b01d3e-e480-4706-ab33-34b69910058a\">surfaced in April</a> when it announced it had cancelled its contract with supplier GDC Technics, which installs aircraft interiors, after it failed “to meet contractual obligations”.</p> <p>GDC Technics filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the same month. The two companies are now suing each other, and Boeing reported a $318m charge in the first quarter related to the programme.</p> <p>Costello said Congress would receive an update in September on whether the schedule would change, and the timing and cost of the deliveries would be renegotiated together.</p> <p>“We have received from Boeing notification of a revised schedule on their part. We are in the midst of doing a schedule risk assessment . . . When they complete [the assessment] later this summer, we will determine if we need to make any adjustments to the schedule.”</p> <p>Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Joe Courtney, Democratic congressman from Connecticut, said the changes were “a disappointment to all of us.”</p> <p>“We thought this was maybe a programme where the government got a good deal,” he said.</p><p>Source: Claire Bushey in Chicago 2021 'Boeing seeks increase in $3.9bn Air Force One fixed-price contract' FT.com 8 June.
