  "title": "Prisoner Swap Intensified Rivalry --- The arrest of a Chinese executive to stand trial in U.S. opened a new era of acrimony",
  "text": "<p>Fifteen time zones away, an Air China Boeing 777 stood ready at Vancouver International Airport. Armed officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police kept watch in the terminal. A Chinese executive in Manolo Blahnik heels strode past them, carrying a bag with a Carolina Herrera dress shaded the same vibrant red as China's flag and trailed by an entourage of lawyers, aides and diplomats who called her Madam Meng. She, too, was headed home.</p><p>One of the most significant prisoner swaps in recent diplomatic history was under way, after a top-secret negotiation that was three years in the making.</p><p>When Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada in 2018, she was chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co., a telecommunications giant founded by her father that was poised to win the race to build 5G networks in most of the world's largest economies. Canadian authorities took Ms. Meng into custody in Vancouver, British Columbia, on behalf of the U.S., which had filed bank-fraud charges against her.</p><p>The detention of the 50-year-old celebrity businesswoman, and U.S. efforts to extradite her for trial in New York, transformed her into a national martyr in China and a symbol of America's growing hostility to its nearest rival.</p><p>Days later, the two Canadians were seized in retaliation for Ms. Meng's arrest. Michael Kovrig, 50, was on leave from Canada's Foreign Ministry to work for the International Crisis Group in Hong Kong. Michael Spavor, 46, ran a business that helped students, athletes and academics visit North Korea. During their incarceration and harsh treatment, the two men were sympathetically shorthanded in news reports and by Western leaders as \"the two Michaels.\" Both men denied wrongdoing.</p><p>The arrests marked a turning point in the growing power competition between the U.S. and China, helping shift it from mutual wariness to full-blown animosity. Unlike last century's Cold War between the U.S. and Soviet Union, the prisoner skirmish reflected a U.S.-China battle for control of the international flow of data and, ultimately, primacy in global commerce.</p><p>Negotiations to free the prisoners strained relations between China, U.S. and Canada. Each nation navigated its own security concerns and domestic political pressures. The U.S. pressed Chinese leader Xi Jinping to release the two Canadians and cited their arrest as evidence of Beijing's disregard for the international rules-based order. Mr. Xi saw Ms. Meng's detention as another underhanded attempt by the U.S. to contain his country's advance.</p><p>Mr. Xi penned more than 100 notes about her case, and he discussed the Michaels with two U.S. presidents. He refused to free them until Ms. Meng was released.</p><p>This account is based on interviews with current and former U.S., Canadian and Chinese officials, lawyers and prosecutors, former Huawei officials, people familiar with Ms. Meng's legal team and her staff, as well as current and former diplomats of the three countries. It draws from court documents, real-estate and corporate records, classified diplomatic cables, unpublished photographs and notes of government officials involved in the negotiations.</p><p>A spokesman for the Chinese consulate in New York declined to answer questions. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has said that Messrs. Kovrig and Spavor were detained and tried in accordance with Chinese law, and their case was unrelated to Ms. Meng's arrest.</p><p>Meng Wanzhou planned to spend only a few hours in Vancouver when she touched down on Dec. 1, 2018. She checked suitcases packed with presentation material for meetings in four countries.</p><p>The Huawei CFO also booked a stop in Buenos Aires, where she would join her father, Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's billionaire founder. Mr. Ren had once announced that none of his three children was visionary enough to succeed him. Ms. Meng, who crisscrossed the world representing her father's empire, seemed determined to prove him wrong.</p><p>Around the time Ms. Meng walked into Hong Kong's international airport, word of her itinerary passed over a secure line to the Palacio Duhau hotel, site of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires. A White House lawyer took the call in a soundproof tent set up in a suite. Afterward, the lawyer woke up John Bolton: Ms. Meng was en route.</p><p>Mr. Bolton, then-national security adviser in the Trump administration, knew Ms. Meng's arrest could disrupt the summit's marquee event that evening, a dinner between President Donald Trump and Mr. Xi. Yet Mr. Bolton, a longtime China hawk, felt it was worth the risk. The president didn't yet know about the plan.</p><p>Federal prosecutors had a sealed indictment against Ms. Meng and Huawei for bank fraud, alleging she had helped disguise the company's business dealings in Iran. The evidence was in a PowerPoint presentation Ms. Meng showed an executive of HSBC Holdings PLC in the back room of a Hong Kong restaurant in 2013. Huawei, she claimed in her presentation, wasn't violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>The charge was narrow, but it would serve a broader national security objective -- to help Washington convince U.S. allies Huawei couldn't be trusted.</p><p>Ms. Meng's extradition request had arrived from Washington on a password-protected file that Canadian authorities needed more than a day to unlock. The delay meant Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, also attending the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, was told of the request only around the time officers took positions at the Vancouver airport's Gate 65.</p><p>At 11:18 a.m., Cathay Pacific Flight 838 rolled to a stop at the terminal gate. Two border guards escorted Ms. Meng to a counter where another guard combed through her luggage. At the police station, Ms. Meng was fingerprinted.</p><p>Messrs. Trump and Xi were dining on Argentine sirloin, accompanied by a 2014 Malbec. The goal of the dinner was to reach a truce in an escalating U.S.-China trade war. Neither man appeared aware of Ms. Meng's arrest. Mr. Bolton, seated near Mr. Trump, didn't mention it.</p><p>Mr. Xi learned shortly after, according to Chinese government officials, and it struck him as deceptive and an insult. He had just agreed to buy more U.S. food and energy.</p><p>Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Bolton days later at a White House Christmas dinner, according to people familiar with the conversation. \"Why did you arrest Meng?\" the president said. \"Don't you know she's the Ivanka Trump of China?\"</p><p>Mr. Xi was briefed on the arrest when he returned to Beijing on Dec. 6. Chinese officials had a list of Canadian names and proposed two for him to select.</p><p>Two days later, a call came to the Canadian embassy from a man stopped while trying to board a 2 p.m. flight to South Korea from a city in China's northeast. \"I'm being questioned,\" Michael Spavor said.</p><p>That night, the embassy got another call, this one about Michael Kovrig. He had been walking in Beijing when he was bundled into a vehicle.</p><p>For hours, embassy officials waited to hear from the two men. Finally, the office fax machine spat out missives announcing the detention of two Canadians suspected of threatening national security.</p><p>Canada's ambassador met with officials in Beijing, who asked for Ms. Meng's release. \"He who ties the knot must untie it,\" one of them said.</p><p>A month later, Mr. Trudeau cemented his government's position at a snow-drenched cabinet retreat in Quebec. Arrests of innocent Canadian citizens wouldn't force Ms. Meng's release. \"Canada cannot be bullied,\" he said.</p><p>To free Ms. Meng, Huawei assembled a team of more than a dozen lawyers, including some of the corporate world's highest-paid.</p><p>Elevating a six-year-old PowerPoint presentation to a charge of bank fraud was an overreach the Justice Department would regret, according to Ms. Meng's lawyers. U.S. prosecutors were confident. If Ms. Meng wanted to plead guilty, they were ready to talk. Otherwise, they would see her in court.</p><p>The White House had a lot riding on the case. Huawei was on the other side of a contest for control of 5G, the wireless network slated to ferry data to billions of devices worldwide. It was a fight the U.S. didn't want to lose.</p><p>Huawei was offering to deliver its 5G equipment -- antennas, base stations and routers -- more quickly and less expensively than its Western competitors.</p><p>U.S. national security officials were convinced of a danger other nations thought could be managed -- that Huawei was assembling the architecture China could use for surveillance worldwide.</p><p>In 2009, U.S. cyberspies had infiltrated the company's networks. FBI analysts, worried Beijing could use those same networks to spy, alerted their bosses. Defense Department officials urged U.S. telecom companies to steer clear of Huawei. A 2012 congressional investigation concluded China could use Huawei equipment for espionage but didn't find clear evidence it had.</p><p>By the time of the Trump administration, Huawei had built a seemingly insurmountable lead over its rivals. An analysis that circulated among intelligence officials warned Huawei would control 80% of the global market for 5G equipment. National security officials feared that would hand China a surveillance tool with the potential to collect all manner of secrets, from the blueprints of nuclear plants to military plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p><p>Defense officials and diplomats reached out to America's closest foreign partners and pushed for Huawei bans. The company challenged the Trump administration to reveal the evidence it claimed to hold, material the U.S. said was secret.</p>",
