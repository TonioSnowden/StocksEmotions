  "title": "Business News: FAA Seeks Fixes to Boeing 777 Engines --- Repairs would follow problems with United flight from Denver after takeoff in February",
  "text": "<p>That's what happened when a United 777's engine failed shortly after takeoff from Denver in February.</p><p>Its external cover, damaged by a broken fan blade, broke apart, and metal components fell into yards in a nearby suburb. No one was injured and the flight landed safely.</p><p>The subset of Boeing 777 jets powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines were effectively grounded after that episode. The FAA ordered immediate inspections of the engine fan blades for cracks that could lead to more potential failures.</p><p>The FAA on Wednesday also proposed an enhanced inspection protocol for the fan blades used in the engines and other components, with specific corrective actions depending on the results.</p><p>Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of Raytheon Technologies Corp., said in a statement that such inspections are already under way.</p><p>United, the only U.S. carrier flying that type of plane, has 52 of the aircraft, some of which had been in storage at the time of the incident.</p><p>The airline had hoped to resume flying the wide-body jets this summer, but a spokesman said Wednesday that the airline will be able to return them to its fleet early next year.</p><p>United said the proposed changes were a \"good outcome\" for the industry.</p><p>The airline said it has been working closely with the FAA, Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney, and many of its affected engines have already gone through the proposed inspections.</p><p>Boeing said that it supports the FAA's guidance on inspection requirements and will work with its customers and with Pratt &amp; Whitney.</p><p>The incident in Denver was the third of its kind in recent years.</p><p>Another engine cover broke apart on a Japan Airlines Co. flight in late 2020, and a similar incident occurred on another United plane en route to Hawaii in early 2018.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
