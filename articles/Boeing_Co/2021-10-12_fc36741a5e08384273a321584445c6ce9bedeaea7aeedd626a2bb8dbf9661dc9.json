  "title": "New York's Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate Needs Religious Exemption, Judge Rules; Decision ends weeks of living in limbo for thousands of New York healthcare workers who had refused shots; state's governor to fight ruling",
  "text": "<p>On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Hurd in Utica, N.Y., ruled that the mandate conflicted with individuals' federally-protected right to seek religious accommodation from their employers.</p><p>Judge Hurd issued a preliminary injunction that extended a Sept. 14 restraining order, barring the state from sanctioning a healthcare facility that honored religious-exemption requests. The 27-page decision said that the health professionals are likely to succeed on their claims that the mandate violates their rights. For thousands of New York healthcare workers, the ruling ended weeks of living in limbo.</p><p>\"With this decision the court rightly recognized that yesterday's 'front line heroes' in dealing with Covid cannot suddenly be treated as disease-carrying villains and kicked to the curb by the command of a state health bureaucracy,\" said Christopher Ferrara, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs and special counsel to the Thomas More Society, a legal group that often advocates for conservative causes.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said she would fight Tuesday's decision. \"My responsibility as governor is to protect the people of this state, and requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated accomplishes that,\" she said in a statement following the order.</p><p>New York City and state were among the first to require some employees to get Covid-19 shots or lose their jobs in most situations, making the state a closely watched legal battleground for vaccine mandates.</p><p>In a separate case Tuesday, a federal judge in Manhattan denied New York City education employees' request to block the city's vaccine mandate.</p><p>Ten workers sued the city Department of Education, its commissioner and Mayor Bill de Blasio over the city order on Sept. 14, claiming the mandate violated their constitutional rights and wouldn't meaningfully slow the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>Nick Paolucci, press secretary for the New York City Law Department, said Tuesday's ruling was a \"resounding confirmation\" that the vaccine policy was lawful. An attorney for the plaintiffs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni ruled that the education employees' lawsuit was unlikely to succeed. She pointed to data cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say fully vaccinated persons are less likely to contract Covid-19. She also ordered a supplemental briefing on whether the employees have standing.</p><p>\"The vaccine mandate does not shock the court's conscience,\" she said. \"Vaccine mandates are not new.\"</p><p>Among the claims brought by the city educators was that Mr. de Blasio showed \"religious animus,\" relying on an Aug. 3 statement by the mayor where he said, \"If you're unvaccinated, unfortunately, you will not be able to participate in many things.\"</p><p>The judge said Tuesday that the statement didn't demonstrate an intent to infringe on religious beliefs, and that it was \"clearly aimed at 100% of the unvaccinated population,\" regardless of \"fear of needles, hostility to big pharma or religious beliefs.\"</p><p>Judge Caproni also criticized the \"massive disinformation about Covid and vaccines that has been relentlessly pushed out through social media and swallowed by some people hook, line and sinker.\"</p><p>\"Smallpox and polio would still be endemic in this country,\" she said, if social media existed at the beginning of the last century.</p><p>Vaccine Mandates</p><p>Related news, selected by the editors</p><p>* Companies Are Caught in the Middle of Vaccine Mandate Fight</p><p>* Boeing Mandates Vaccination for Employees</p><p>* Brooklyn Nets Ban Kyrie Irving Until He Gets Vaccinated</p><p>* Texas Governor Bans Private Businesses From Requiring Vaccines</p><p>Write to Deanna Paul at deanna.paul@wsj.com</p><p>New York's Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate Needs Religious Exemption, Judge Rules</p>",
