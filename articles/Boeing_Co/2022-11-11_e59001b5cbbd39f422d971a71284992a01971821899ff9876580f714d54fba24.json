  "text": "<p>For much of 2022, the economy has stayed hotter than many investors anticipated. That has prompted the Fed to raise rates at the fastest pace in decades -- causing bond yields to soar and putting the stock market on track for its worst pullback since the global financial crisis.</p><p>That is why many investors found so much relief in Thursday's inflation data. The core consumer-price index -- which excludes volatile energy and food prices -- rose 6.3% in October from a year earlier, less than the 6.5% increase economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected and down from a 40-year high in September. Overall inflation was 7.7%, down from 8.2% in September.</p><p>The data fueled hope that the Fed will moderate its pace of interest-rate increases in 2023.</p><p>Markets raced higher right out of the gate Thursday and kept building on those gains over the following hours. The S&amp;P 500 added 207.80 points, or 5.5%, to 3956.37, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite soared 760.97 points, or 7.4%, to 11114.15. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,201.43 points, or 3.7%, to 33715.37.</p><p>The rally continued in Asia early Friday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 5.5%, South Korea's Kospi up 2.9% and Japan's Nikkei 225 up 2.8%.</p><p>The three U.S. benchmarks scored their steepest one-day percentage gains since the depths of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.</p><p>\"We believe that the stock and bond markets have found a bottom and we can rally off the lows,\" said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.</p><p>Mr. Hatfield said that he believes inflation will ease even more next year, especially if energy prices continue to trade lower than where they were in the first quarter of 2022.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested at a news conference last week that he wouldn't necessarily need to see a series of lower inflation readings -- as many traders had previously thought -- to support slowing the pace of rate increases. That gives Thursday's report significant weight for money managers who believe markets will be in the best position to stage a comeback when inflation peaks and the Fed can at least pause its rate increases.</p><p>Yet others are less sure. Even with last month's moderation, inflation is still very high.</p><p>Investors have also seen a version of this rally play out before -- only for it to crumble apart. Stocks soared over the summer on bets that the Fed would pivot away from tightening monetary policy and shift from interest-rate increases to rate cuts as early as next year.</p><p>But the gains were fleeting. Markets slumped in both August and September, weighed down by stern talk from Fed officials about the need to keep raising rates, as well as hotter-than-expected inflation data.</p><p>\"I can see a window where the market gets this kind of second false dawn, like we saw over the summer, where it gets excited about a peak Fed and peak inflation narrative,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.</p><p>Analysts and investors said markets' path from here hinges heavily upon inflation and how that influences the Fed's policy trajectory.</p><p>Before the Fed's December announcement, traders will get another inflation reading from the Labor Department as well as the monthly jobs report. The case for the Fed to raise interest rates by half a point next month instead of three-quarters of a point \"will still hinge on continued cooling\" in those two reports, Bank of America economists said in a note.</p><p>Still, traders seemed to already begin betting on less aggressive Fed policy for the months ahead.</p><p>Federal-funds futures showed the market pricing in a terminal rate -- the highest level the Fed is expected to raise rates to -- of around 4.87%, down from a little over 5% Wednesday, according to FactSet.</p><p>Thursday's gains were broad, lifting stocks across all industries.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks lenders like Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., rose 5.8%.</p><p>Shares of manufacturers, which are sensitive to changes in the economic outlook, jumped. Boeing Co. rose $8.84, or 5.2%, to $177.58 and 3M Co., the producer of goods such as Scotch tape and safety equipment, added $5.32, or 4.3%, to $129.15.</p><p>Bonds rallied as well. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.828% from 4.149% Wednesday, logging its biggest one-day pullback since March 2009. Bond yields fall as prices rise.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies also got a break.</p><p>The fall from grace of FTX, previously one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, rippled across the digital currency and token markets this week. Crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday reversed course on a rescue offer for FTX, leaving the firm with an uncertain future.</p><p>Even with those headwinds, though, bitcoin rose 13% to $17807.13 Thursday in New York after slumping Wednesday to less than $16,000. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. jumped $4.94, or 11%, to $50.92.</p><p>In politics, control of the Senate remained up for grabs, with contests in critical states too early to call and Georgia headed to a runoff. Republicans were on track to regain control of the House.</p><p>Mr. Redha, of PineBridge Investments, said investors might cheer a return to divided government in the near term.</p><p>---</p><p>Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article.</p>",
