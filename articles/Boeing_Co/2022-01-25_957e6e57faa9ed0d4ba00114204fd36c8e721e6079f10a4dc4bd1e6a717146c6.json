  "title": "Business News:  Boeing Invests $450 Million  More in Air-Taxi Venture  ----  By Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. said it is investing a further $450 million in its air-taxi joint venture with Google co-founder Larry Page, developing small, pilotless aircraft for short passenger hops in and around cities. </p><p>   The company's Silicon Valley-based Wisk venture joins an expanding crowd of electric air vehicles that attracted billions of dollars in new funding over the past year. Some aim to start service by the middle of the decade, though those efforts hinge on an evolving regulatory framework to ensure passenger safety. </p><p>   Rivals Airbus SE and Embraer SA are developing electric air taxis, alongside other startups that attracted interest and investment from airlines, private jet operators and aircraft leasing companies. </p><p>   Wisk was formed in 2019 through a venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk Corp., an electric aircraft maker co-founded by Mr. Page. Wisk is developing an aircraft seating three to four passengers that can take off and land vertically, flying autonomously. </p><p>   Details on the latest version that Wisk intends to operate commercially -- and which likely will be larger -- are due to be disclosed later this year, according to Boeing. </p><p>   Rivals like Joby Aviation Inc. and Vertical Aerospace Group Ltd. are developing piloted, taxi-style aircraft that would later transition to autonomous flight, as executives expect regulators to first certify aircraft with flight crew. </p><p>   Boeing didn't provide a timeline for when the Wisk vehicle might enter service but said it would be after rivals with piloted aircraft. </p><p>   \"Autonomy has to be done from the very beginning,\" said Marc Allen, Boeing's chief strategy officer. \"The extra time that will take to certify is the trade-off.\" </p><p>   After closing its venture capital arm last year, Boeing, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday, is focusing its air-taxi efforts on Wisk. </p><p></p>",
