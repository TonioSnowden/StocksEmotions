  "text": "<p>\n  MARYLAND </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Catholic Bishops Pick </p><p>\n  Conservatives to Lead </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Tuesday chose two conservatives to serve as national president and vice president, a move that signals strong support among the nation's top bishops for a policy platform centered on opposition to abortion. </p><p>\n  Archbishop Timothy Broglio, a former Vatican diplomat who oversees ministry to Catholics in the U.S. Armed Forces, was elected president with 138 out of 237 votes at the fall meeting of the bishops in Baltimore. He succeeds Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles. Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore was elected vice president by 143 votes out of 239. </p><p>\n  Both men, who will serve for three-year terms, are considered doctrinal conservatives and have taken confrontational stands on abortion politics. This is in contrast with the more conciliatory approach favored by Pope Francis and his closest allies among the bishops. </p><p>\n  -- Francis X. Rocca </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  FDA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New Steps Weighed </p><p>\n  To Safeguard Formula </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday outlined measures it is considering to safeguard baby formula from cronobacter infections, including requiring doctors to notify public health officials of cases. </p><p>\n  The proposed measures were developed after four infants were hospitalized, including two who later died, from rare bacterial infections from cronobacteria after being fed powdered baby formula. The safety concerns prompted a formula recall and nationwide shortages that have persisted in places. The FDA said it would work to complete the strategy over the next several months. </p><p>\n  -- Kristina Peterson </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  WASHINGTON </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Housing Agency Says </p><p>\n  Reserves Hit Record </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A federal housing agency on Tuesday said its financial reserves have reached record levels and that it was well positioned to weather a mortgage-market downturn. </p><p>\n  The audit, released by the Federal Housing Administration on Tuesday, likely gives officials room to trim mortgage costs over the coming months as part of a push by the administration to address housing affordability. </p><p>\n  The FHA doesn't issue mortgages but insures lenders against losses. Borrowers can pay for insurance on mortgages with down payments of as little as 3.5%. It is unclear how much the FHA would cut premiums charged for the loans they insure, but a reduction is a priority of industry groups and consumer advocates. Industry officials are asking for cuts that would save new borrowers $50 to $70 a month, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. </p><p>\n  -- Andrew Ackerman </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NASA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Third Launch Attempt </p><p>\n  Of Moon Rocket Set </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NASA will try to get its enormous moon rocket off a launchpad for a third time early Wednesday morning after technical problems stymied earlier attempts. </p><p>\n  The mission is a critical jumping-off point for Artemis, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's multiyear agency program to return astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972 and set the stage for broader agency space-exploration efforts. </p><p>\n  Artemis I, as this mission is called, is designed as an intense test of the vehicles that NASA is depending on, specifically the Space Launch System rocket that will blast the uncrewed Orion spacecraft toward the moon. Boeing Co. developed the SLS rocket, while Lockheed Martin Corp. is the lead company behind Orion. </p><p>\n  NASA was planning to try to blast an SLS rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as soon as 1:04 a.m. ET on Wednesday. </p><p>\n  -- Micah Maidenberg </p><p></p>",
