  "text": "<p>In premarket trading, Boeing shares fell more than 6% after a Boeing 737 passenger plane operated by China Eastern Airlines carrying more than 130 people crashed in southern China. Nielsen Holdings shares dropped 17% after it rejected a roughly $9 billion takeover offer from a private-equity consortium, saying that it undervalued the TV-ratings company.</p><p>The Ukraine war has heightened volatility in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, as investors try to assess the economic impact of sanctions and the potential for disruptions to supply chains. Investors are monitoring developments out of the region and whether a resolution can be soon found. The Ukrainian government said it wouldn't relinquish Mariupol after Moscow gave the besieged port city's defenders until Monday morning to surrender.</p><p>\"This is the main driver of markets in the coming days and maybe even weeksâ€”it is about everything that comes out of the Ukraine conflict,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research.</p><p>Mr. Brzeski said he is awaiting surveys of purchasing managers at businesses in the U.S. and Europe, due Thursday, for an initial assessment of how the war is beginning to hit economies.</p><p>Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, added 3.1% to $111.29 a barrel. Elevated oil prices have prompted concerns of sustained high inflation and lower economic growth in the U.S. and Europe, as gas and energy prices eat away at household spending on other goods and services.</p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn focus on Europe's reliance on Russian energy, with Germany getting over half of its gas from Russia. Investors expect untangling those trade links could lead to prolonged elevated energy prices.</p><p>\"We have this growing awareness that a couple of supply chains could be broken for good. Energy prices, no matter how the war resolves, will remain high,\" Mr. Brzeski said.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was flat Monday. Russia's stock market remains closed. Russia's central bank will purchase government bonds when trading resumes Monday, Gov. Elvira Nabiullina said. She said the Moscow Exchange, which has been closed since Feb. 25, would reopen gradually but provided no details beyond the bond buying.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.187% from 2.146% Friday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Major indexes in Asia closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.9%. China's Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Tick Lower After Last Week's Rally</p>",
