  "text": "<p>Airbus has broken America's hold on the Japanese satellite industry with its first sale to one of the country's leading telecoms services companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>The European aerospace group has been chosen by Sky Perfect JSAT to build a new satellite for television and broadband services over eastern Asia. </p> <p>Airbus will design and manufacture the satellite, and provide services and support for in-orbit operations. </p> <p>It is the first time a Japanese satellite operator has selected a non-domestic or non-US manufacturer, according to Airbus.&#xa0;</p> <p>Jean-Marc Nasr, head of space systems at Airbus, said it was “a big victory for us as it's Japan”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dubbed “Superbird-9”, the satellite will be based on Airbus's OneSat line, part of a new type of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ce79ba-d9f7-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">flexible satellite</a> that can change functions in orbit, according to customer needs. </p> <p>Traditional satellites were sent into orbit with a fixed function — a drawback as consumers increasingly spend time on mobiles and computers that use WiFi or cellular connections.</p> <p>New spacecraft being developed by manufacturers, such as Airbus, Boeing and France's Thales Alenia Space, are designed with the expectation that they will have to move around to meet changing demand rather than being fixed. </p> <p>By using digital payload technology, these satellites will allow operators to change their services while in operation, moving from providing video to broadband to 5G.&#xa0;</p> <p>Airbus won its first contract for OneSat with Britain's Inmarsat in 2019, followed by Australia's Optus, the country's second-largest telecoms company. </p> <p>Inmarsat's satellite will be the first one to be launched in the OneSat product line, in 2023. Airbus now has contracts for seven satellites across the world. </p> <p>The aerospace group said some of the core technology of the OneSat system was originally developed in the UK as part of Airbus' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2fd0f9a-2006-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d\">SkyNet 5 contract</a> to supply secure communications to the British military.&#xa0;</p> <p>The new breed of satellites will also be cheaper and faster to produce. </p> <p>Airbus said OneSat's modular design and build meant that production time would be about 18 months, which compares with 24 to 30 months for older generations, according to analysts. </p> <p>Key modules, including payload, propulsion and antenna will be designed and manufactured in the UK.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company said that once the market was fully established, OneSat satellites would be 50 per cent cheaper and twice as fast compared with previous generations of spacecraft.</p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer 2021 'Airbus breaks US hold on Japanese satellite market ' FT.com 25 March.
