  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 309 points, or 1%, to 32,145.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 24 points, or 0.6%, at 3,884.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP was fractionally lower at 11,195, erasing a steep early loss.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow rose 337 points, or 1.1%, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq advanced 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 is up 7.6% so far in October, but remains down 19% for the year-to-date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has jumped 5.7% since Thursday's close as a generally positive third quarter earnings season, and hopes the Federal Reserve may be less aggressive in hiking rates after weak economic data and the Bank of Canada's smaller-than-expected rate rise.</p><p>Also helping to boosting the positive sentiment is the continued slide on Wednesday in bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and the dollar DXY.</p><p>\"I think it's reasonable to believe that the Fed will slow (its rate hikes),\" said Larry Cordisco, co-chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management. However, \"where I think there may be too much hope in the market with people seeing the pause as sort of a way station on the way to a pivot,\" Cordisco said.</p><p>\"I just think the Feds going to be very reluctant to pivot, even if the economy's in a bit of a recessionary period as long as inflation remains high. It's tough to see how inflation comes down rapidly to their 2% target side,\" Cordisco said.</p><p>Speculation has mounted over the potential for the Federal Reserve to reduce the size of its rate increases in December after delivering what's expected to be another supersize 75 basis point jump when policy makers meet next week.</p><p>The Bank of Canada's decision Wednesday to raise its key overnight lending rate by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, to 3.75%, was seenreinforcing that expectation, analysts said. Nine of 12 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecasted a 75 basis point rise.</p><p>The move suggests that central banks are starting to wake up to the possibility that too aggressive rate rises could do more harm than good,\" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note. \"It's also got markets asking the question, could the Fed follow suit next week after another poor set of housing numbers from the U.S.\"</p><p>Don't miss: MarketWatch live market coverage</p><p>Still, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on course to snap a three-day winning streak after poorly-received earnings reports from Microsoft MSFT and Google parent Alphabet GOOG. Shares of both were trading at least 5% lower.</p><p>For Alphabet, advertising on both Google and YouTube was \"a bit softer than what people wanted, even when you take into account foreign exchange headwinds,\" said Cordisco. \"That's a sign of economy decelerating a little bit.\"</p><p>Attention will next turn to results from Meta META, due after the market close, and then Apple AAPL and Amazon.com AMZN on Thursday.</p><p>Read: U.S. dollar rally takes a breather as currency slumps versus major rivals</p><p>In U.S. economic data, the trade deficit in goods widened 5.7% in September to $92.2 billion as a strong dollar hindered exports.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Boeing Co. BA shares were down 0.1% after the aircraft maker reporting a widening third-quarter loss and revenue that missed analysts' estimates by almost $2 billion amid what the company's CEO described as a \"challenging environment.\"</p><p>* Visa Inc. V shares rose 5.8%, after the company topped earnings expectations for its latest quarter Tuesday. Payments volume at grew 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter, while processed transactions increased 12%.
