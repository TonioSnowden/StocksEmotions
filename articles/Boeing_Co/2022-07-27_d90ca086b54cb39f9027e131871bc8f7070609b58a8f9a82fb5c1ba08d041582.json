  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 386 points, or 1.2% to 32,148.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 91 points, or 2.3%, to 4,011.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 434 points, or 3.7% to 11,996.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 229 points, or 0.71%, to 31762, the S&amp;P 500 declined 46 points, or 1.15%, to 3921, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 220 points, or 1.87%, to 11563.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday afternoon as the central bank announced another 75 basis point interest rate hike to tame four-decade high inflation.</p><p>In a statement, Fed officials said they decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25% – 2.5% and anticipated that \"ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.\"</p><p>See: Fed hikes rates by 0.75 percentage points and signals more hikes coming</p><p>The decision was announced at 2 p.m. in Washington and Chairman Jerome Powell is holding a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Powell's comments will \"be heavily influential on the movement of the market,\" said Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.</p><p>\"If he acknowledges the layoffs, and he acknowledges the low consumer sentiment, the market will probably rally on this comments. If he focuses more of the underlying strength of the economy, the market will probably anticipate that as room for them to tighten more and market might sell off on those comments,\" Philip said in a morning interview.</p><p>Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, says the central bank will want to send a hawkish message but might find it hard to accomplish.</p><p>\"The easy path to sending that message is to set up another 75bp hike in September, but I don't think the Fed will do that if, as I suspect, the goal is to reduce the level of guidance while creating a hawkish path that does not require an additional super-sized hike,\" said Duy. \"It might be a tricky space to navigate; we have always said the Fed will face a communications challenge when it comes time to set the stage for stepping down from 75 bp.\"</p><p>In U.S. economic data Wednesday, durable-goods orders jumped 1.9% in June. That was largely due to more bookings for new cars and trucks, but there were hints of weakness among other manufacturers. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.4% decline in new orders for products meant to last at least three years.</p><p>Meanwhile investors are digesting second quarter earnings reports. More than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies have reported calendar second-quarter earnings thus far. Of those names, roughly 70% have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.</p><p>The rally Wednesday was led by tech stocks with the Nasdaq 100 outperforming after reassuring results from Alphabet, Microsoft and Texas Instruments TXN.</p><p>Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT each missed earnings expectations in their reports Tuesday night, though shares of both were up as they both posted quarterly revenue growth. Among the wave of companies reporting results on Wednesday are plane maker Boeing BA and, after the market close, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms META META.</p><p>\"There's just a little bit more positive spin on what you're seeing,\" Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA said in a phone interview.</p><p>\"Over the last 24 hours, we've had strong results from Microsoft, Alphabet. This morning alone, Boeing wasn't that bad. We also saw some positive comments about the economy from Hilton and Visa as far as summer travel spending. Chipotle is doing pretty well. You had very strong durable goods numbers. So all of a sudden now we're getting a rosier picture of the economy,\" Moya said.</p><p>See: Google and Microsoft earnings show the bar has been lowered for Big Tech</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Boeing Co.
