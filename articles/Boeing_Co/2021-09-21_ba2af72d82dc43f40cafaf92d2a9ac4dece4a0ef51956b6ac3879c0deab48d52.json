  "title": "NASA Reorganizing Human Spaceflight Division as Private Space Industry Expands; One new unit will focus on projects such as visiting Mars, while the other will manage commercial space activities closer to Earth",
  "text": "<p>The reorganization is \"about helping us as we set the stage for the next 20 years and we are defining NASA's future in a growing space economy,\" agency administrator Bill Nelson said at a briefing Tuesday.</p><p>NASA's role for some space-related activity has been shifting. The agency has sought to foster a broader commercial-space sector it can tap into, and investors and entrepreneurs have been making bets on more business opportunities beyond Earth.</p><p>Instead of producing its own replacement for the new-retired space shuttle, the agency has used rockets from Northrop Grumman Corp. and Elon Musk's SpaceX to resupply the International Space Station with cargo. SpaceX has flown astronauts to and from the space station.</p><p>The agency is also looking to the private sector to develop destinations in orbit that would replace the space station, drawing interest from such companies as Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC, among other space enterprises, according to a document NASA posted to a website regarding that effort.</p><p>Separately, at a hearing before a House subcommittee focused on space on Tuesday, Robyn Gatens, NASA's director for the International Space Station, said the agency believes it could save more than $1 billion annually by purchasing services from private space facilities. The agency currently spends up to $4 billion each year on the research station, officials have said.</p><p>\"Those savings are important because we can apply those savings to expand our exploration efforts\" to the moon, Mars and elsewhere, Ms. Gatens said at the hearing.</p><p>The agency is now starting to prepare for the transition out of the space station, which is expected to be structurally sound until 2028, although it can be used beyond that year, she said.</p><p>NASA wants to have commercially run destinations available before it moves out of the space station so there isn't a gap in operations in orbit, according to Ms. Gatens.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>NASA Reorganizing Human Spaceflight Division as Private Space Industry Expands</p>",
