  "text": "<p>In Palestinian's Death</p><p>The Israeli military said it is considering filing charges against two soldiers over the death this year of 78-year-old Palestinian-American Omar Assad, who died after being detained by Israeli soldiers at a West Bank checkpoint.</p><p>Attorneys for the men said they don't believe their clients will face manslaughter charges because investigators haven't been able to directly link their actions to Mr. Assad's death. The decision to charge the soldiers is pending a hearing.</p><p>Mr. Assad died in mid-January after Israeli soldiers bound, temporarily gagged, blindfolded and left Mr. Assad on the cold ground for 30 minutes after he was unable to show identification when they stopped him while he was driving home after visiting friends, an Israeli investigation found. The investigation said he died of a heart attack.</p><p>-- Dion Nissenbaum</p><p>---</p><p>INDONESIA</p><p>Report Details Cause</p><p>Of 2021 Jet Crash</p><p>Investigators said a mechanical failure linked to automated engine controls and a delayed pilot response led to the crash of a passenger jet in the country last year that killed all 62 people on board.</p><p>The Boeing Co. 737 jet operated by Sriwijaya Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff on Jan. 9, 2021. Investigators had said after last year's preliminary assessment that the aircraft's auto-throttle system, which is designed to adjust fuel flow and thrust, failed to function properly. After climbing to nearly 11,000 feet, the aircraft went from a normal nose-up position to a dangerously unstable, nose-down one.</p><p>In its final report released Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Committee investigating the crash identified a series of problems, starting with the auto-throttle. Issues with the auto-throttle had been reported by pilots many times before the day of the crash, the report said.</p><p>Another problem was that as the auto-throttle was failing, sensors that should have detected the anomaly and disengaged the system didn't activate when they should have.</p><p>The pilots should have recognized that the plane was veering off course, the report said.</p><p>-- Feliz Solomon</p><p>---</p><p>CANADA</p><p>Central-Bank Chief</p><p>Calls for Labor Reset</p><p>The unemployment rate has to climb from near-record lows to contain inflation, Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said, arguing the current level of joblessness isn't sustainable for the economy.</p><p>He predicted the eventual rise in the unemployment rate, as the economy slows from higher interest rates, would be limited relative to previous recessions. \"There is scope to cool the labor market without causing\" a surge in joblessness, he said.</p><p>Canada's unemployment rate hit a record low of 4.9% in June, and crept upward to 5.2% as of October. Employment is roughly 500,000 higher than it was prior to Covid-19, Mr. Macklem said.</p><p>-- Paul Vieira</p>",
