  "text": "<p>Purchase, N.Y.-based Atlas Air, with a market value of roughly $2 billion, serves freight, commercial, charter and military customers. In 2016 it announced an agreement to provide air-transport services to Amazon.com Inc. in a deal that also gave the e-commerce giant warrants to purchase shares in the company.</p><p>The deal would come amid an overall slowdown in mergers and acquisitions, including for private-equity firms. Higher interest rates have made financing deals more expensive and buyout loans harder to come by. But that hasn't choked off activity entirely, as seen for example by an agreement signed last week for JetBlue Airways Corp. to buy passenger airline Spirit Airlines Inc. in a $3.8 billion deal.</p><p>New York-based Apollo is one of the world's largest private-equity firms, with roughly $500 billion in assets under management. It is known for seeking bargains in sectors including media and for its big lending arm.</p><p>Atlas Air was founded in 1992 and operates the world's largest fleet of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, according to its website. It is set to report second-quarter results Friday.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com</p><p>Apollo-Led Group in Advanced Talks to Buy Atlas Air</p>",
