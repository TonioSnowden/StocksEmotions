  "text": "<p>Stocks finished last week with slim losses, snapping a five-week winning streak.</p><p>Despite price pressures that have lingered longer than many investors expected, the indexes are still close to records.</p><p>Companies that have reported earnings so far have broadly beaten analysts' expectations, supporting stock prices.</p><p>Higher inflation has also suppressed the returns on government bonds, a main alternative to stocks.</p><p>\"It seems as if the equity markets are kind of a bit detached from other markets,\" said Jim Besaw, chief investment officer of GenTrust. Mr. Besaw is holding traditional hedges against inflation such as commodities, real-estate investment trusts and Treasury inflation-protected securities.</p><p>Dollar Tree added $16.15, or 14%, to $129.23 after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has a stake of at least $1.8 billion in the discount retailer and plans to push it to act to boost its share price. CyrusOne shares rose $4, or 4.7%, to $89.45 after the data-center operator said it is selling itself to investment company KKR &amp; Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners LLC in an all-cash transaction.</p><p>Boeing shares added $12.13, or 5.5%, to $233.09 after the company said over the weekend that it had received new orders for its converted freighters.</p><p>\"Good news keeps coming up despite the fears. It makes it harder to wait for too much of a pullback,\" said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation Group.</p><p>Casper Sleep shares soared $3.14, to 88%, to $6.69. The company said it had agreed to a takeover from investment group Durational Capital Management.</p><p>Tyson Foods reported a jump in sales after sharply raising prices for its beef, chicken and pork, citing growing costs the company said were likely to persist. Shares rose $2.88, or 3.5%, to $84.11.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved higher for the third trading day to 1.621%, the largest three-day yield gain in a year. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>\"We're seeing a recovery in the economy, seeing rising wages and the Fed is moving toward tighter monetary policy, so it's inevitable we're going to see yields moving higher,\" Mr. Russell said.</p><p>Brent crude futures, the global oil market benchmark, lost 12 cents a barrel, or 0.15%, to $82.05, the lowest settlement value in more than a week.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged 0.3% higher. Shares of U.S.-listed Royal Dutch Shell rose after the oil company said it planned to consolidate its dual British and Dutch structure into a single U.K.-based entity.</p><p>The Beijing Stock Exchange opened for trading Monday, marking the debut of a venue that China hopes will channel funds into innovative smaller companies. All of the 10 newly listed stocks jumped, triggering temporary trading halts.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.8% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.1%.</p>",
