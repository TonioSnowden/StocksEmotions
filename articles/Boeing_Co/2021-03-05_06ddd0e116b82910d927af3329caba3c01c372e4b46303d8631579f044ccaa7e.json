Yields on 10-year Treasuries spiked 0.07 percentage points to 1.55 per cent after his remarks, reviving a rout in the $21tn market for US government debt.</p> <p>In equity markets, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index extended recent losses, briefly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09c527c7-801e-4a72-823b-8e4998e00de5\">wiping out gains</a> for the year so far, with a fall of as much as 1.7 per cent. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite closed down 2.1 per cent, turning negative for the year.</p> <p>The Fed chair suggested that although central bank officials were watching the market movements, it would take more to perturb them. </p> <p>“As it relates to the bond market, I'd be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening in financial conditions broadly that threatens the achievement of our goals,” he said.
