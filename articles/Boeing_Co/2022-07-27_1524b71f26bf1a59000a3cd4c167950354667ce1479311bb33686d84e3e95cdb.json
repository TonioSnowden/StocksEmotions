  "title": "Boeing Needs to MAX-imize Its Recovery; 737 MAX deliveries are key if the plane maker is to generate cash this year, but maintaining June's positive trends won't be easy",
  "text": "<p>To be sure, defense revenues continued to disappoint and U.S. regulators still haven't cleared the way for its other key product, the 787 Dreamliner, following a series of defects. But deliveries seem set to resume this summer, and the fallout from the war in Ukraine will probably soon send a wave of cash toward defense contractors.</p><p>The fate of the MAX is subject to many more unknowns, both positive and negative. It may be the key driver of Boeing's stock, which is down more than 50% since the onset of the pandemic but still not an obvious buy. The plane maker is trading at an enterprise value of around 12 times expected 2024 earnings—the year when travel is expected to fully recover. This is in line with pre-Covid valuations, but those were historically elevated.</p><p>On the one hand, the MAX is selling better than its detractors predicted. During last week's Farnborough International Airshow, it garnered 233 orders, including 100 planes by Delta Air Lines—the only top U.S. carrier that hadn't yet bought it. This compared with 73 orders for Airbus's competing A320 family. The A320 remains more popular overall. Counterintuitively, though, this may work in favor of the MAX right now, as airlines are much more likely to get their planes ahead of time. While the A320 has a backlog of around 6,000 orders, the MAX's is closer to 3,400 due to cancellations in recent years.</p><p>To meet demand, Airbus is trying to ramp up production to a whopping 75 jets a month by 2025, but engine supplier Pratt &amp; Whitney said last week that supply-chain bottlenecks make this unlikely until 2026. By contrast, Boeing still has more than 200 MAX jets in parking lots that can now be shipped, bringing in a massive inflow of cash. Boeing also met its target of producing 31 MAX planes a month in June, bringing total deliveries to 43.</p><p>On the other hand, June's production rate is already proving hard to maintain amid shortages of engines and parts. This is why Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has scrapped earlier plans to raise the MAX production rate to 38 a month, and on Wednesday refused to set a new date for the target. Yet analysts still expect that production rate in early 2023, Visible Alpha data shows.</p><p>Mr. Calhoun suggested that deliveries will slow, too. Even stored jets often need components replaced before they are deemed airworthy.</p><p>Worse, the MAX-10—the plane's coming elongated version, which Delta ordered—could be scrapped if U.S. lawmakers don't extend its certification process beyond the end of this year. Failure to extend would imply flight-deck modifications that would make the model diverge from other MAX aircraft, threatening its economic viability. This is a big risk: The MAX is already lagging behind at the extended-range end of the market, which poses big longer-term questions for Boeing, and losing the MAX-10 could give some operators another reason to switch to the A320.</p><p>Airlines are increasingly comfortable with the MAX. The question for Boeing's stock is whether investors are also on board.</p><p>Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Needs to MAX-imize Its Recovery</p>",
