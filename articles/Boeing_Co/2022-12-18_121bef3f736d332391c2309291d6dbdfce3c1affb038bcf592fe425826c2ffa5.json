  "title": "Congress Races to Finish $1.7 Trillion Spending Bill Before Christmas; Lawmakers face deadline to OK government funding or face shutdown",
  "text": "<p>Because it is the last piece of legislation that Congress will pass in this session, lawmakers have spent weeks lobbying to attach other bills, including funding for Ukraine, changes to tax policy and a measure to update how Congress deals with disputes over certifying presidential-election results.</p><p>Both the Senate and the House will need to pass it by the end of the week before government funding runs out on Friday night.</p><p>Lawmakers have agreed to fund military programs at $858 billion—the level set by a defense policy bill that passed in a Senate vote this past week—up from $778 billion a year earlier. But they have been haggling over nondefense spending. A week ago, congressional negotiators announced they had reached a framework on the bill, but provided no details.</p><p>The Senate is expected to vote on the bill first. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has been part of the negotiations and set a deadline of Thursday to reach a deal—a day before the money runs out—but he said his patience was limited and that he wouldn't allow talks to stretch past Christmas.</p><p>\"I hope they are able to produce text of a bipartisan government funding bill that can pass the Senate before our hard deadline next Thursday,\" he said this past week. \"Otherwise, I will support pivoting next week to a short-term continuing resolution into the new year.\"</p><p>The bill was largely negotiated without the involvement of House Republicans, and most of them are expected to oppose it. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has said Congress needs to cut spending and advocated for pushing talks into next yearso that his party could be more involved when they take the majority in January.</p><p>\"Unless there are some responsible measures to either cut spending or balance the spending that we're doing right now, I will not be supporting it,\" said Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.).</p><p>That means House Democrats, who have a narrow 218-213 majority because of recent resignations and the death of a lawmaker, will likely need to pass the bill mostly by themselves and can't afford to lose more than a few votes.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What would you like to see included in the omnibus funding bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Lawmakers are planning to add a bipartisan bill that would expand incentives for retirement savings, and they have been working for months to reconcile House and Senate versions. The legislation is expected to raise the starting age for required minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts, encourage enrollment in retirement plans and expand savings incentives for low-income households. It is also likely to include new limits on aggressive tax deals known as syndicated conservation easements.</p><p>Prospects for a broad bipartisan agreement on tax breaks for businesses and families are dim. Lawmakers are considering whether to reverse a change in how companies are required to spread research costs over multiple years instead of deducting them immediately. That was part of the 2017 GOP tax law and took effect this year. Democrats say they won't do that unless Republicans agree to expand the child tax credit, particularly in ways that help low-income children whose families don't get the full credit under current law. Those talks have been stalled.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said this past week that he expects the bill to include an update to the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which requires Congress to convene for a joint session after a presidential election, on Jan. 6, to count and ratify the electoral votes certified by the 50 states and District of Columbia. The vice president, serving as president of the Senate, has the duty to count the votes. After the last election, then-President Donald Trump pressured his vice president, Mike Pence, to reject some electors unilaterally, which Mr. Pence refused to do.</p><p>The bill would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial and that the vice president's role is merely to count the votes publicly. It also would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors.</p><p>\"It's essential to cutting down the chances of the wrong president being put in the White House in 2025,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.).</p><p>Congress could also include a measure that would steer federal money toward projects to restore habitats for struggling species. The measure would fund state conservation plans, which are federally required strategies and wish lists that wildlife agency officials keep on struggling animal, fish and plant populations they monitor. Those plans say more than 12,000 species need conservation help because of extreme weather, habitat loss, invasive species and disease. Such plans received unstable funding in the past.</p><p>Other lawmakers are trying to include a measure that would extend a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. The company would be required by law to install new cockpit-alerting systems to help pilots resolve emergencies in the wake of two deadly crashes.</p><p>The deadline was set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without an extension, Boeing said in a securities filing it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. The company didn't specify how much it could lose in the filing, but orders for the planes are valued at tens of billions of dollars in revenue.</p><p>Richard Rubin and Katy Stech Ferek contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Congress Races to Finish $1.7 Trillion Spending Bill Before Christmas</p>",
