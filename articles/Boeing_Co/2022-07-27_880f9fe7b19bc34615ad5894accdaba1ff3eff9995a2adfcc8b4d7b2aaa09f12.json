  "title": "Business News: New CEO Tapped for Jet-Engine Company",
  "text": "<p>The appointment comes as Rolls-Royce mounts a recovery from a pandemic that has hit the aviation sector hard. The company derives most of its income from manufacturing and servicing engines for Boeing Co. and Airbus SE's biggest wide-body aircraft, which are typically operated on long-haul international routes.</p><p>The pandemic grounded many of those big planes and even now, as the industry emerges from the Covid-era travel slump, demand for those aircraft is trailing the quicker recovery for smaller jets. In response, Rolls-Royce -- a British blue chip that shed its luxury-car business years ago -- has announced thousands of job cuts and sought to raise billions of dollars, including through disposals, to bolster its finances.</p><p>The CEO switch also comes as Rolls-Royce's customers are dealing with the transition to lower-carbon energy. Mr. Erginbilgic has a firm understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by the drive for low-carbon technologies, Rolls-Royce Chairwoman Anita Frew said.</p><p>Rolls-Royce itself has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its operations by 2030, excluding product testing, and joined a United Nations-backed campaign to enable the sectors in which it operates to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>Mr. Erginbilgic, a U.K. and Turkish national, is a partner at Global Infrastructure Partners, a private-equity firm that focuses on large-scale investments in infrastructure businesses. During five of his more than 20 years at BP, Mr. Erginbilgic was part of the oil giant's executive team.</p>",
