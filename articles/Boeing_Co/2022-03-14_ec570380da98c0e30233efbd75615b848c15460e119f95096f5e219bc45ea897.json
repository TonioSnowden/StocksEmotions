  "title": "5G Technology (A Special Report) --- 5G and Air-Travel Safety: What We Know So Far: Test flights in the U.S. and Europe aim to deliver answers in a yearslong controversy",
  "text": "<p>In the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration this year started flying specially outfitted airplanes over Michigan and Southern California that measure 5G signals in the air. And a U.S. Defense Department-funded program has aircraft circling test ranges in Colorado and Utah to measure how in-flight instruments respond to those signals.</p><p>The parallel experiments address worries that certain 5G signals could confuse flight instruments, called radar altimeters, that feed real-time altitude data to cockpit safety systems.</p><p>\"We are working really hard to obtain solid engineering data so that we will either know that there is or isn't a problem rather than guessing,\" says Frank Sanders, a senior researcher at the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, a federal lab running tests for the Pentagon program.</p><p>Such knowledge has been a long time coming. FAA officials flagged concerns as early as 2015 that radar altimeters could pick up unwanted wireless signals, but the scientific record was limited.</p><p>Radar altimeters are all designed to operate between 4.2 gigahertz and 4.4 GHz on the wireless spectrum, but some of them don't effectively filter out signals they receive outside of that band -- an artifact of devices designed several decades before the invention of the smartphone. U.S. cellphone carriers eventually will use frequencies spanning the 3.7-3.98 GHz range.</p><p>\"Bad front-end receivers, in some of the altimeters -- those need to be fixed,\" says Ted Rappaport, director of the wireless research center at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. \"5G stays in its lane.\"</p><p>In 2019, lab tests at the Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute, a research cooperative of aerospace companies and government organizations, based at Texas A&amp;M University, found that altimeters might detect signals in the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz band under certain circumstances. RTCA Inc., an industry-government group that advises the FAA, followed that with a paper in late 2020 that raised similar concerns.</p><p>Telecom-industry executives said at the time that lab tests couldn't re-create conditions in the air. Wireless companies around the world moved forward with their 5G expansions subject to various signal-power limits. Then, in early 2020, the Federal Communications Commission authorized companies to start using new 5G frequencies as soon as December 2021. The U.S. regulator said that the wavelengths it auctioned would be far enough away from aviation frequencies to avoid harmful interference.</p><p>But U.S. air-safety regulators were unconvinced, and this winter issued restrictions on certain airports and aircraft models that caused some airlines to cancel some flights. AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to postpone the launch of their high-speed wireless services using the new frequencies until late January. Later, they temporarily scaled back the signals around airports while regulators worked to sort out the issue.</p><p>Experts from the aviation and telecom industries could have started holding deeper \"engineer to engineer\" discussions of the available research two years ago, but pertinent information didn't start flowing between the two until recently, according to AVSI Director Dave Redman.</p><p>\"That's been one of the disappointments here,\" Dr. Redman says. \"Somehow it got politicized or commercialized, and it became more arm's-length. Between industry, the level of technical discussion that we needed really started in January.\"</p><p>At the same time, telecom companies have started working closely with the FAA, with AT&amp;T and Verizon engineers riding on FAA planes collecting signal data near active 5G cell towers..</p><p>\"It's really unprecedented for us to be working with an industry that we don't regulate,\" says FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. \"We were hitting a wall before,\" because of a lack of real-world data on how 5G signals might impact airplanes, Mr. Dickson says. \"Now we have it.\"</p><p>Engineers outside the U.S. have run some limited experiments to flesh out the findings from the lab tests in 2019 and 2020. In France, regulators ran field tests last June and December involving helicopters to determine whether 5G signals could interfere with their radar altimeters, says Eric Fournier, director of spectrum planning and international affairs at France's frequency regulator.</p><p>The airborne experiments tested three models of helicopters and two types of altimeters. Mr. Fournier says the tests didn't reveal any effect on the devices.</p><p>\"We were able to have some reasonable confidence that at least for helicopters, for the gendarmerie and emergency services, there will be no problem,\" he says, adding that the agency has considered tests for planes.</p><p>Field tests in Norway also found no effect on several types of radar altimeters tested at an airport in the country's southwest, according to John-Eivind Velure, director of the spectrum department at Nkom, Norway's telecom agency.</p><p>The Norwegian tests were carried out in April 2021 at Bergen Airport using a cellular base station mounted on a terminal building. The radar altimeters tested were installed on eight types of aircraft, including helicopters and Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 planes, Mr. Velure confirms.</p><p>\"The main conclusion is that we didn't find anything,\" he says. More recently, Nkom said it didn't find any operational effects on radar altimeters in three types of helicopters during tests it and other agencies conducted at an airport to the east of Oslo.</p><p>In Canada, an agency called Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has tested how 5G signals and radar altimeters interact in a lab and is now working on plans for field tests that could be conducted over the next few months. Wireless companies recommended that the agency work to gather more data, including by potentially conducting field tests, according to a description of comments they submitted to the regulator about restrictions on 5G in a certain spectrum band.</p><p>Canadian authorities in November issued restrictions related to that spectrum that include 5G-frequency exclusion zones near runways at certain airports and a national requirement that antennas for ground stations used to beam wireless connections be tilted down. ISED Canada said in a filing that it \"considers a cautious approach to possible interference is warranted by imposing the proposed mitigation measures until further studies are completed.\"</p><p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a January press conference that 5G service and aviation can coexist. She added that telecom companies that bid for spectrum need confidence in the rules before they spend billions of dollars on licenses to expand their service.</p><p>\"As we use more of our airwaves for commercial wireless activity, we are going to have to engage in more cooperation -- early and often,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. FitzGerald is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Washington, D.C.
