  "text": "<p>Ryanair is&#xa0;preparing to bring to an end its 20-year listing on the London Stock Exchange&#xa0;to comply with EU rules following Brexit as it announced it had swung back to profit for the first time since 2019. &#xa0;</p> <p>The Irish airline said on Monday it has begun a review into whether to give up its London quote, which is a secondary listing, to focus on its primary market of Dublin. </p> <p>“I think it is an inevitability post-Brexit,” chief executive Michael O'Leary said. “In my personal view, I think we will probably delist sometime in the next six months.”</p> <p>The revelation came as Ryanair reported a net profit of €225m in the three months to the end of September, its first since the last quarter of 2019, the period before coronavirus disruption swept through aviation. </p> <p>O'Leary said the issue over its listing was down to strict EU rules that insist EU airlines are majority owned and controlled by nationals from within the bloc, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p> <p>Ryanair barred non-EU individuals from buying shares in the company and extended this to institutions and individuals in the UK at the start of this year. O'Leary said this meant the airline was 100 per cent controlled by EU shareholders, but added “we are not yet 100 per cent EU-owned”. </p> <p>“We would have had, pre-Brexit, about 20 per cent of the stock held or controlled here in the UK. And we need reduce that, or be seen to be taking steps to reduce that, over the next couple of years,” he told the Financial Times. </p> <p>The UK and EU agreed to explore liberalising airline ownership rules when they signed their trade deal in December, but have made no visible progress on the issue. Instead, O'Leary said he expected Brussels to clamp down on airlines in the coming months.</p> <p>“The EU authorities, I think particularly the French or the Germans, are going to take a very strong view on EU ownership. Particularly with a dispute between the French and the UK,” he said. </p> <p>The return to profit announced on Monday underscored Ryanair's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e66b8ec-0d6c-48f9-a8ec-a0d217d8ebb3\">rapid recovery</a> from the coronavirus crisis. Still, O'Leary expects to cut ticket prices to stimulate demand over the traditionally lean winter months.</p> <p>“I think the pricing would be a little bit more difficult in the winter but the volumes are very strong,” he said. </p> <p>Ryanair has also left open the possibility of a new aircraft order with Boeing, although O'Leary said he would wait until the US company dropped its prices. </p> <p>For the six months to the end of September, the company's financial first-half, Ryanair lost €48m, down from a €411m loss the previous year. In the same period in 2019, the airline reported a profit of €1.3bn.</p> <p>Ryanair carried 39.1m passengers in the six months, up from 17.1m the previous year. Revenue rose 83 per cent to €2.15bn, faster than operating costs, which were up 60 per cent to €2.2bn. </p> <p>However, the group forecast a full-year loss of between €100m to €200m, slightly worse than analysts had forecast.</p> <p>The airline's shares were up 2 per cent to €17.01 by mid-morning. </p> <p>Also on Monday, British Airways announced it has secured a £1bn UK-government backed commercial loan. </p> <p>The new financing, which will only be drawn down if needed, boosts available liquidity at owner IAG, which stood at €10.6bn at the end of September.</p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis and Philip Stafford 2021 'Ryanair considers London delisting to comply with Brexit' FT.com 1 November.
