  "text": "<p>Markets have bounced back and forth this week in reaction to pandemic headlines. Wall Street lost ground Wednesday after the first Omicron case was identified in the U.S., but on Thursday, traders were focused on comments from the World Health Organization's chief scientist suggesting vaccines were likely to still offer some protection.</p><p>Officials said Thursday that President Biden planned to tighten Covid-19 testing timelines for travelers entering the U.S. and extend a mask mandate on transportation.</p><p>\"More than anything, people are still dealing with uncertainty about Omicron and how much of a threat it poses,\" said Salman Baig, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. \"Some might see this as a buy the dip opportunity. But it wouldn't surprise me if the market action reverses or loses steam later today.\"</p><p>Shares of Vir Biotechnology surged over 15% premarket after the biotech firm and partner GlaxoSmithKline said their Covid-19 antibody drug was effective against the Omicron variant in early laboratory studies.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.421%, declining for a third day. The yield curve has flattened this week, with shorter-dated bond yields rising and longer-dated ones ticking down.</p><p>Markets are also still reacting to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that suggested the central bank was prepared to accelerate tapering, said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco.</p><p>How do we balance this potential growth impact from Omicron, with more signals of policy tightening from the Fed, Ms. Taylor asked. \"Markets are all over the place.\"</p><p>Shares of WeWork dropped over 5% in premarket trading. The office-sharing company said that it would restate several quarters of its results, including its latest one, and that management had concluded there was a material weakness in its internal controls. Apple declined 2.8% after Bloomberg reported that the company had said demand for iPhones was lower than expected ahead of the holiday season.</p><p>Earnings season is ongoing. Dollar General shares fell 2.4% premarket after the company said its profit fell in the third quarter and cut its full-year guidance for same-store sales. Cosmetics company Ulta Beauty and gun maker Smith &amp; Wesson Brands are expected to post earnings after markets close.</p><p>Stocks popular among individual investors rose in premarket trading, recovering some ground after sharp declines Wednesday. GameStop gained 2.5% and Robinhood added 2%.</p><p>Boeing climbed 4.4% premarket after China's aviation authority issued a directive on the 737 MAX, bringing the plane a step closer to returning to Chinese skies.</p><p>Oil prices rose. Global benchmark Brent crude rose 1.3% to $69.74 a barrel. Traders are awaiting signals from OPEC and its allies about whether the group will halt planned production increases. Ministers are scheduled to speak Thursday.</p><p>Bitcoin extended losses into a third consecutive day, trading at around $56,300, down 1.2% from its level at 5 p.m. Wednesday.</p><p>Overseas, the Turkish lira depreciated 1.1% against the dollar, trading at 13.4 lira to $1, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named a loyalist as the new finance minister. The lira has lost around 45% of its value this year on concerns about Turkey's economic policy.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.4%. Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma jumped over 20% on reports that biotech firm CSL may acquire it.</p><p>\"It does seem like European countries are a bit more reactive to Covid news. We expect European stocks to be more sensitive to what's going on with Omicron, or Covid broadly,\" Mr. Baig said. \"Right now we have a significant preference for U.S. equities over European.\"</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index ticked down 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.7%, with SoftBank closing down over 5%. Shares of the technology-investment firm have fallen for five straight days due to declines in some of its portfolio companies, such as Alibaba, WeWork and DoorDash.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Waver After Omicron-Driven Selloff</p>",
