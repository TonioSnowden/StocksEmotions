  "title": "FAA Safety Chief to Be Named Acting Leader; Billy Nolen was selected to serve as FAA associate administrator for aviation safety in December",
  "text": "<p>An official announcement about Mr. Nolen's appointment was expected to come as soon as Monday, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>As acting FAA chief, Mr. Nolen would confront a host of aviation challenges, including maintaining airline safety as carriers increase operations to meet surging demand, approving deliveries of Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner amid various production lapses and assisting Chinese authorities' investigation of a recent crash of a U.S.-made plane in that country.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whom the Biden administration planned to nominate as a permanent FAA chief to succeed Mr. Dickson, who was appointed to the role by then-President Donald Trump and confirmed for the position by the Senate in 2019.</p><p>A Transportation Department spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to comment Saturday.</p><p>Mr. Nolen, or whoever eventually wins Senate confirmation as FAA administrator, would take the controls of an air-safety agency trying to emerge from the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. The accidents, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, took 346 lives and prompted regulatory, congressional and criminal investigations.</p><p>The MAX crashes exposed breakdowns in how the FAA approved a flight-control system later blamed for sending the jets into fatal nosedives. The FAA has been working to implement a new law governing how regulators approve new aircraft as safe for passengers.</p><p>The agency also has initiatives under way related to electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft, drones and space launches.</p><p>Mr. Dickson, the current administrator of the air-safety agency, is a pilot and former Delta Air Lines Inc. executive. In February, he said he would step down March 31, citing personal reasons for the planned departure.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>FAA Safety Chief to Be Named Acting Leader</p>",
