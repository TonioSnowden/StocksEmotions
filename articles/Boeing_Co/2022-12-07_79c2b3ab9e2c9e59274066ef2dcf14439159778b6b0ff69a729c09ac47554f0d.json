  "title": "Lawmakers Agree to Rescind Military's Covid-19 Mandate in Defense Deal; NDAA proposal increases total national security budget to $857.9 billion",
  "text": "<p>This year's NDAA would approve a 4.6% pay raise for military service members and Defense Department civilians. The bill, which typically passes with bipartisan support, also would authorize funding for the State Department and intelligence agencies, and for new aircraft, ships and vehicles for combat, while budgeting for newer technologies such as microelectronics and hypersonic weapons.</p><p>Republicans had pushed for the bill to end the Defense Department's Covid-19 vaccine rule from August 2021, arguing that it would help recruitment. Roughly 3,400 U.S. military members have been discharged for refusing to get the vaccine as of April, according to a letter that 13 Senate Republicans sent to party leaders on the issue last week.</p><p>Administration officials acknowledged this week the possibility that the Pentagon's vaccine mandate could be repealed in the defense bill, but said they continued to believe the vaccine saves lives.</p><p>Talks over the NDAA had bogged down earlier Tuesday as congressional leaders wrangled over provisions unrelated to the U.S. military. In the end, lawmakers didn't include language that would have overhauled energy permitting, enabled banks to do business with marijuana companies and created a process for publishers of smaller news outlets to negotiate for compensation when technology giants such as Facebook and Google use their content.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) had criticized Democrats for trying to include nondefense provisions, calling them a \"grab bag of miscellaneous pet priorities.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had defended the proposals.</p><p>\"We've been working with Republicans,\" he said. \"It's a priority for me. I'd like to get it done. We'll try to discuss the best way to get it done.\"</p><p>The NDAA is one of two major initiatives that Congress is trying to finish by the end of the year, along with a spending bill that would fund the operations of the U.S. government. Negotiators need to reach a deal on funding the government by Dec. 16 to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>Mr. McConnell had questioned whether Congress had time to finish the bill funding the government for the full year, known as the omnibus bill, saying that lawmakers might have to push any deal into next year, when Republicans take control of the House.</p><p>\"I think it's becoming increasingly likely that we may need to do a short-term CR into early next year,\" said Mr. McConnell, referring to a continuing resolution that keeps funding at current levels.</p><p>Democrats rejected that assertion. \"Several weeks remaining are in the calendar year, which is an eternity in Washington,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who will be the minority leader in the next Congress.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think should be given priority in the new NDAA defense bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Among other closely watched proposals, negotiators dropped a provision that would have given Boeing Co. a reprieve from a Dec. 27 deadline to win regulatory approval for two new 737 MAX models. A 2020 aircraft-safety law imposed the deadline, after which new planes must feature modern cockpit-alerting systems.</p><p>Included in the bill is language authorizing up to $10 billion over 5 years to finance sales of weaponry and military equipment to Taiwan, and provide training and other security assistance to help the island defend itself against a possible invasion by China.</p><p>Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katy.stech@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com</p><p>Lawmakers Agree to Rescind Military's Covid-19 Mandate in Defense Deal</p>",
