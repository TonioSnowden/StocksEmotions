  "text": "<p>   SAO PAULO -- Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA said on Monday it will ask two foreigners to join the company's strategy committee later this year, and will add at least one non-Brazilian to its board of directors in 2023, as it seeks to grow through partnerships and business diversification. </p><p>   The move comes almost a year after U.S. aerospace giant Boeing Co. dropped plans to take control of Embraer's jetliner business, citing a failure to agree to final terms before the termination date of the agreement. </p><p>   The end of that agreement, and the impact on aircraft sales caused by the coronavirus pandemic, led the Brazilian company to set a new strategy. The goal is to boost revenue and profit by cutting costs, moving into new business areas and seeking global partnerships as a way to help finance current and new projects. </p><p>   \"The aviation sector is in full transformation in the face of several challenges such as the pandemic, the arrival of new entrants, and the development of innovative and sustainable technologies,\" said Alexandre Silva, president of Embraer's board of directors. </p><p>   Adding foreign members with experience in commercial aviation to the strategy committee and the board \"aims at strengthening management by enhancing our global vision and preparing the company for the future,\" he said. </p><p>   Embraer is a producer of regional passenger jets that also makes executive jets and military aircraft. The company said in November that one of its units signed an agreement with United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit to overhaul some of the U.S. company's jet engines as part of Embraer's effort to move into new markets. </p><p></p>",
