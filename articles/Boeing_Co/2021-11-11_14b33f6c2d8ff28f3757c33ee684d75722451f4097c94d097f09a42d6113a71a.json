  "title": "Elon Musk's SpaceX Launches Astronauts to International Space Station; Crew of four aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon are expected to reach the orbiting research facility Thursday evening",
  "text": "<p>The capsule is expected to dock with the research facility Thursday night, about 22 hours after liftoff, kicking off a roughly six-month stint during which the group will conduct research into plant science, materials and other topics, NASA has said.</p><p>NASA had planned the launch for late October but delayed the trip several times because of weather conditions and because of a medical issue, described as minor by the agency, that affected one crew member.</p><p>The quartet will succeed another group of astronauts who arrived on the space station back in April. That crew—Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur from NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Akihiko Hoshide and Thomas Pesquet from the European Space Agency—left the facility Monday on another SpaceX Crew Dragon. It flew around the space station so that crew members could photograph its exterior. Then the vehicle began its descent and splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico under parachutes at 10:33 p.m. ET, returning the astronauts to Earth after 199 days in orbit.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think Elon Musk's ventures mean for the future of space exploration? Join the conversation below.</p><p>NASA and SpaceX had planned to conduct the latest launch before bringing the other crew back to ground, allowing for a short overlap on the space station between the two groups of astronauts. But the delays and tricky weather prompted officials to shift the sequence of events.</p><p>\"We had some weather conditions that really set up to make us land instead of launch first,\" Steve Stich, a NASA program manager, said at a briefing Tuesday night.</p><p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for Mr. Musk's enterprise, has emerged as the leader in human spaceflight in the U.S., providing NASA an alternative to purchasing seats on Russian government rockets.</p><p>Last year, SpaceX blasted astronauts to orbit from U.S. soil for the first time since the agency ended the space shuttle program in 2009. It has since launched three other crews of astronauts to the space station, including Wednesday's flight.</p><p>\"Human spaceflight is core to SpaceX's ultimate mission,\" Sarah Walker, a director at the company, said during a recent briefing about Wednesday's launch.</p><p>Spaceflight</p><p>* America's Return to the Moon Will Have to Wait a Year</p><p>SpaceX, which has developed reusable rockets and space capsules, has extended its technology developed for NASA to private missions, like the orbital trip in September that technology entrepreneur Jared Isaacman purchased for himself and three others. Space company Axiom Space Inc. has acquired four flights from SpaceX to take commercial astronauts to the space station, with the first such mission scheduled for February.</p><p>NASA picked SpaceX and Boeing Co. seven years ago to provide vehicles the agency could hire to take astronauts to the space station and bring them back to ground. While SpaceX has completed multiple flights under that contract, Boeing has struggled to complete testing for its ship, called the Starliner.</p><p>The aerospace company last month recorded a $185 million charge related to stuck valves on the Starliner that prompted the postponement of a demonstration launch of the vehicle last summer. During a previous test flight in 2019, the Starliner failed to reach the space station as planned. Executives at Boeing have said the company will fulfill commitments it has made to NASA to carry crew to and from the space station.</p><p>SpaceX has made changes to and analyzed its space vehicles, in part based on their performance in flight. During Mr. Isaacman's trip, a tube became unglued on the Crew Dragon and urine wasn't deposited in a storage tank as designed, said William Gerstenmaier, a SpaceX vice president, during a recent briefing.</p><p>Those on board that flight didn't notice the issue, but urine contaminated areas under the capsule's floor, raising concerns about corrosion and necessitating changes to the vehicle used for the latest launch, according to Mr. Gerstenmaier. Officials from NASA and SpaceX concluded that the vehicle that returned to Earth Monday night, meanwhile, could be operated in a safe manner in spite of that issue.</p><p>Separately, when the Crew Dragon was returning to Earth on Monday, one out of the vehicle's four parachutes was roughly 75 seconds late in deploying, Mr. Gerstenmaier said yesterday. That performance was within the design criteria established for the spacecraft but generated fresh analysis of the parachutes by SpaceX and NASA staff, he said.</p><p>\"We're still learning how to operate these vehicles. We're learning how to fly in space, and the way you do that safely is you keep looking at the data, and you learn from each and every flight,\" Mr. Gerstenmaier said.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>Elon Musk's SpaceX Launches Astronauts to International Space Station</p>",
