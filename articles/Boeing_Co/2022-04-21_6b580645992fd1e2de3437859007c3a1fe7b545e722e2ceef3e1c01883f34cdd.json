  "title": "World News: Few New Clues Found In China Plane Crash",
  "text": "<p>Investigators are now focusing on the painstaking process of piecing together evidence explaining why the jet pitched toward the ground, with a last-recorded speed of 1,010 kilometers per hour (628 miles an hour) before disintegrating on impact. The CAAC said it had so far found nothing abnormal with the operation of the flight before the crash.</p><p>Data from the aircraft's severely damaged flight recorders -- best known as black boxes -- is still being recovered and analyzed, CAAC said. The National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. agency that investigates transportation accidents and is participating in the probe, has helped download information from the two recorders in its lab in Washington, D.C.</p><p>The preliminary report, which the CAAC said contains no analysis or conclusion about the cause of the crash, hasn't been made public. According to the ICAO's rules, China can decide to keep it confidential, although countries are encouraged to produce a publicly available final report within 12 months of a crash.</p><p>The Boeing jetliner had been approved to fly and its flight crew were qualified, the CAAC said. Radio communications between the pilots and air-traffic controllers on the flight from Kunming to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou had been normal before radar warned of a deviation in the plane's cruising altitude at 2:20 p.m., just four minutes after the last exchange with ground control.</p><p>Air-traffic controllers immediately hailed the jet but received no response, the summary said.</p>",
