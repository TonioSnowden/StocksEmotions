  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. told airlines to stop flying its wide-body 777 aircraft equipped with a type of engine that broke apart during a flight over the weekend near Denver, as the Federal Aviation Administration moved to order immediate inspections of those jets. </p><p>   Boeing's recommendation on Sunday followed action by regulators in the U.S. and Japan aimed at the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines found on 128 of its 777s. The United Airlines flight Saturday was the third failure involving that model plane with those engines in recent years. </p><p>   Safety investigators in the U.S. are trying to determine why the engine failed shortly after the Honolulu-bound flight took off, forcing the plane to return to Denver International Airport and leaving a trail of debris scattered over a nearby town. </p><p>    United Airlines Holdings Inc., the only carrier in the U.S. that uses that engine type, said earlier Sunday that it had taken two dozen planes out of service. </p><p>   Regulators in Japan had already ordered airlines to stop flying aircraft with the same engine type until further notice, including 13 Boeing 777s flown by Japan Airlines Co. and 19 such planes operated by All Nippon Airways Co. </p><p>   Many of the 128 jets that Boeing recommended be sidelined while the FAA completes its inspection plan are already in storage. Airlines have mothballed some of the wide-body aircraft they use for long flights due to the coronavirus pandemic that has weakened demand for travel. Boeing said 69 of the 777 aircraft with certain Pratt &amp; Whitney 4000-series engines are in service. </p><p>   A preliminary examination by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that two fan blades in one of the United aircraft's engines were fractured -- one nearly entirely and the other about half-broken, the agency said Sunday. </p><p>   The remaining fan blades showed signs of damage, while the plane also sustained minor damage, the safety board said. </p><p>   Such engine failures, in which internal parts break through the engine's protective casing, can badly damage planes because debris can hit wings, fuel tanks and fuselage. </p><p>   The events are rare and prompt stepped-up investigative scrutiny, and even more so in this case because planes that make extended flights over water, hours from emergency airports, face heightened requirements for maintenance and other safety measures, industry officials said. </p><p>   The FAA said on Sunday that it decided to accelerate inspections of the hollow fan blades on this engine type, which is used only on some Boeing 777 airplanes, after reviewing the initial safety data. </p><p>   The safety board's investigators are expected to download information from the plane's flight-data and cockpit voice recorders and review maintenance and other documents as part of their probe, which may take months to complete. </p><p>   The FAA's aviation safety experts are meeting with engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of Raytheon Technologies Corp., and Boeing to finalize an emergency directive with exact details of required inspections, according to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. </p><p>   Boeing said it was working with U.S. and Japanese regulators while the engine maker conducts more inspections. Raytheon didn't respond to requests for comment on the moves by U.S. and Japanese regulators. </p><p>   Boeing has delivered more than 1,600 of its 777 jets with a variety of engines since its debut in the 1990s. </p><p>   United said taking the Boeing 777 aircraft out of service would affect a small number of customers. It added that it has 28 additional Boeing 777 aircraft with the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, but they are in storage. </p><p>   Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said it has asked the U.S. aviation authorities to investigate the incident and \"prevent its recurrence.\" A Japan Airlines spokesman said the airline has 22 Boeing 777 aircraft with a different type of engine that can still fly. A Boeing spokeswoman referred questions about the grounding to that country's air-safety regulators. </p><p>   United Flight 328 landed safely less than 25 minutes after taking off on Saturday following the failure of its right engine. United said none of the 241 passengers and crew members on board were injured. </p><p>   What made the incident more unusual than other engine failures -- and potentially more dangerous -- is that the cowling, which covers the front of the engine, looks to have come off, said John Cox, a retired pilot, ex-crash investigator and former senior union safety official in the U.S. Mr. Cox isn't involved in the probe involving the United flight. </p><p>   In Broomfield, Colo., large pieces of debris fell in a park and in neighborhoods, police said. There were reports of property damage, but no one was injured, police said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Doug Cameron and Peter Landers contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
