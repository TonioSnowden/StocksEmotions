  "text": "<p>Last week, the Dow notched its best three-week stretch since November 2020, offering investors a reprieve from the selling pressure that has whipsawed portfolios this year. The rally was kicked off, in part, by a batch of corporate earnings—particularly from banks and airlines—that offered an encouraging outlook on the U.S. economy. Stocks then raced higher on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that Federal Reserve officials are likely to consider the possibility of shifting to smaller interest-rate increases in December.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 6.4% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since the global financial crisis. Chinese leader Xi Jinping cemented his control over the ruling Communist Party by securing a third term and appointing a number of loyalists to the party's most powerful decision-making body.</p><p>The news battered stocks with exposure to China, weighing on the tech sector and the Nasdaq. Tesla shares slumped 7.4% after the company lowered prices for vehicles sold in China, the world's biggest electric-vehicle market.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu both plunged 19%. Casino operator Las Vegas Sands, which owns properties in Macau, tumbled 13%, making it the worst performer in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>\"There is concern about the direction of U.S.-Chinese relations, and I think that will continue to ripple through the market,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But, she added, \"As far as Wall Street is concerned, it's still fixated on what the Fed is doing.\"</p><p>Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds inched higher still on Monday. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 4.268% from 4.212% Friday, which was already one of the highest yields of this year.</p><p>Many investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for a fourth consecutive time at its meeting next month. Most are now focused on what will happen in December. Federal-funds futures, used by traders to wager on the course of interest rates, on Monday morning showed a 48% chance that the central bank raises interest rates by a smaller 0.5 percentage point in December, up from 34% last week, CME Group data show.</p><p>Investors are looking ahead to a busy week of earnings reports. Despite some early reports that have shown signs of optimism, fewer companies than usual are beating Wall Street's earnings expectations. Traders this week will parse reports from blue-chip companies including Coca-Cola and Boeing, in addition to megacap technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>Overseas, the FTSE 100 gained 0.4% after Rishi Sunak, the U.K.'s former Treasury chief, won the contest to succeed Liz Truss as prime minister, reassuring investors after a volatile period for British markets. U.K. government bond prices rallied, sending yields lower. The yield on the U.K.'s 10-year gilt fell to 3.797%, from 4.052% Friday, while the British pound was little changed against the dollar.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.1%.</p><p>In Asia, China's CSI 300 dropped 2.9% and the Shanghai Composite fell 2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3% amid a possible yen-buying intervention by the Japanese government.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Mixed Ahead of Busy Earnings Week</p>",
