  "title": "Boeing to Move Base to Virginia  ---  Move brings senior  executives closer to  decision makers in  U.S. government  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. said it planned to move its global headquarters to Arlington, Va., from Chicago, a shift that would bring the aerospace giant's leadership closer to top federal officials after a challenging period. </p><p>   The announcement comes as the future of many of Boeing's jetliner and military programs lies with regulators, Pentagon officials and lawmakers following a tumultuous three years for the company. </p><p>   Details of the move haven't been finalized. They are expected to be announced as soon as next week, according to some of these people. </p><p>   Northern Virginia is already home to many of the largest U.S. military contractors, and the local property and labor market has been fueled further by Amazon.com Inc.'s decision to locate one of its secondary headquarters there. </p><p>   Boeing has for months been in talks with the office of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has been working to woo the plane maker and other businesses to the commonwealth, according to a state official. While details of Boeing's agreement with the state aren't final, they aren't expected to involve significant financial enticements but may include workforce-related incentives, the official said. </p><p>   The aerospace company also said Thursday that it would establish a research and technology hub in northern Virginia that would focus on areas including cybersecurity, autonomous operations and systems engineering. </p><p>   Many of Boeing's senior executives have increasingly been working out of its Washington, D.C., area offices or remotely in recent years. Boeing in 2017 said it would move its defense unit's headquarters to Arlington from St. Louis to be nearer to lawmakers and Pentagon procurement officials, with government-affairs and other staff also working from the office complex opened in 2014. </p><p>   Boeing was attracted to northern Virginia in large part because of its engineering talent pool as well as the proximity to its biggest customer -- the U.S. government -- and various suppliers and business groups with presences in the nation's capital, according to a person familiar with the company's discussions. </p><p>   Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) said he had been lobbying Boeing's senior leadership for over a year to move its headquarters to Virginia. He said the state's diverse pipeline of engineering talent has grown with major companies moving to Virginia and noted Boeing already has an outsize presence in Washington. \"This is not like a company that needs to move to the region to raise its visibility,\" Sen. Warner said </p><p>   Boeing's move closer to Washington, D.C., would follow years of sometimes strained relations with various federal agencies and elected officials. </p><p>   The Federal Aviation Administration, based in Washington, has increased scrutiny of Boeing since two of the company's 737 MAX jets crashed in 2018 and 2019. The air-safety regulator prevented the company from returning the MAX jets to service for nearly two years. More recently, the FAA has withheld approvals needed to resume 787 Dreamliner deliveries that have been halted because of production problems. </p><p>   Boeing has also dealt with problems tied to various defense and space programs in recent years. Military contracts accounted for more than half of Boeing's $62.3 billion in sales last year. </p><p>   Boeing shares closed down 4.1% at $150.47 on Thursday and have fallen sharply this year. The stock is up around 23% over the past two years, compared with a 58% rise in the industrial components of the S&amp;P 500 index. </p><p>   Lawmakers and unions have criticized Boeing for the remoteness of its Chicago base from its jetliner operations in the Seattle area. </p><p>   \"This will further distance the company from its engineering and manufacturing workforce,\" said a spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, the union representing Boeing engineers. </p><p>   Illinois's two Democratic senators also criticized the move. \"Boeing's decision to leave Illinois is incredibly disappointing -- every level of government in our state has worked to make Chicago and Illinois the perfect home for Boeing's headquarters for the past 20 years,\" said Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth in a joint statement. </p><p>   The company's decision to move its corporate headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001 was symbolic of its desire to be seen as more than just a maker of commercial jets. Boeing acquired rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997, adding military jets and other military equipment to its portfolio. </p><p></p>",
