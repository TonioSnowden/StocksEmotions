  "title": "Boeing Clears Hurdle for Resuming 787 Dreamliner Deliveries; FAA approves company's plan to address various quality problems with 787 production",
  "text": "<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has approved Boeing's plan for dealing with problems and carrying out fixes for the planes, but would still need to clear each 787 delivery. The company still has to submit paperwork for the first planned delivery to the regulator, said the person.</p><p>Boeing hasn't been able to deliver Dreamliners for much of the past two years because of a series of production defects that drew increased scrutiny by its own engineers and regulators at the FAA.</p><p>The aerospace giant said it had about 120 of undelivered Dreamliners—which analysts estimate are together worth more than $25 billion—in its inventory at the end of June.</p><p>The freeze has hobbled Boeing's cash flow, with just 14 aircraft delivered since the start of 2021. The impact has rippled across the supply chain as monthly production has fallen to a handful from a peak of 14.</p><p>The Dreamliner's latest defects arose in 2019. As Boeing engineers looked for quality problems, they found more cases of tiny gaps where sections of the fuselage join together. The imperfections individually didn't amount to an immediate safety risk, but could result in premature fatigue in need of repairs sooner than expected.</p><p>The FAA launched a broad review of Boeing's 787 production in late 2020, and earlier this year increased scrutiny by deciding to have its inspectors sign off on each Dreamliner delivery individually, rather than allow Boeing employees to perform routine final safety checks as they have been able to do in the past.</p><p>Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Clears Hurdle for Resuming 787 Dreamliner Deliveries</p>",
