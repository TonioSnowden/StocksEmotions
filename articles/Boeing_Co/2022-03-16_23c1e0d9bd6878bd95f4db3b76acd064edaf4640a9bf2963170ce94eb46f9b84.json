  "text": "<p>By 3.30pm the sun over Lassbyn, a village 35 miles north of Lulea in Swedish Lapland, has given up its struggle through the sub-Arctic sky, settling the land back into twilight. The temperature nudges minus 15C and such is the wind-chill on the back of a snowmobile that the cold hits my cheeks like a slap.</p> <p>Onwards we roar — past rust-red houses, through copses of birch — until we swerve around a snowdrift into a sudden white void: a frozen lake. Ahead is a sight so counterintuitive that I spontaneously start to laugh.</p> <p>Tethered to the ground on the far shore, a hot-air balloon hangs above snow-dusted pines. It is indigo blue, decorated with daisies and buttercups and childish drawings of birds. It looks utterly incongruous; an explosion of colour in a monochrome world.</p> <p>Five burly Swedes wrestle it down so that I can clamber aboard its wicker basket. Pilot Bjorn Bruce grins, pulls down his fur trapper's hat and, with a roar of gas, we rise into the air.</p> <p>At 140ft, the lake below becomes a sinuous ribbon unfurling to the foot of a domed mountain. Hills appear behind hills. When the gas burners cut out, I can hear the soft <em>tink-tink-tink</em> of rapidly cooling metal. Otherwise there is only awed silence. </p> <p>The first hot-air balloon flights here in Swedish Lapland took off last month. “We wondered why no one was flying up here and thought it was because it was too technical,” says Jonas Gejke, co-founder of Aurora Safari Camp, a glamping destination in the woods outside Lassbyn which is running the flights. “But it wasn't.” </p> <p>Arctic ballooning in winter might seem like a new high in adventure travel-bragging but it is actually safer than in summer. Ask a pilot like Bruce — who flew Boeing 787s for Norwegian before switching to balloon safaris over the Masai Mara — and he'll explain how the Siberian High anticyclone blankets northern Sweden with cold still air from September to early April. He'll also mention how thousands of lakes freeze from early autumn, providing safe landing zones.</p> <p>There are complexities: propane depressurises at low temperatures, so you need to add nitrogen; daylight hours are short and low clouds can prevent flying. In short, there are no guarantees. “We're still figuring this out; where to start from, where to land,” says Gejke. “But I've flown Masai Mara sunsets over herds of elephants. This is way better.”</p> <p>Perhaps only Gejke could have come up with such a fantastical idea. A modern-day Viking — bearded, intrepid and with “Carpe diem” tattooed in Norse runes along his forearm — he sees Lapland from the perspective of having founded Masai Mara outfit Hot Air Safaris 25 years ago. He still runs Kenyan trips during European summers.</p> <p>There's something of the African safari about Aurora Safari Camp too. Launched in 2013, it offers accommodation in three heated tents (each for a couple or a family) and two pyramid-shaped wooden cabins sleeping two, with big windows to spot the Northern Lights. I stay for three nights in a “cone” among Narnia-esque forest, the snow so thick on the boughs that it looks like foam. Outside, my breath plumes in the chill. Inside, it is almost T-shirt temperature. Each night I fall asleep watching the stars boiling behind silhouettes of the pines.</p> <p>Meals are served beside a lake in a communal dining tent, a fire crackling almost permanently on its deck. A sauna sits on a raft, frozen into the lake's thick ice; you flit between the super-heated wooden cabin and an hole hacked in the ice for a dunk that makes your skin crackle. Everything is off-grid and minimal-impact.</p> <p>Behind it all is the idea of connecting with this extraordinary landscape. One evening, between dinner courses, I stand on the lake in minus 29C cold as the Northern Lights pulse and glitter. The air feels brittle. It's terrific to be out here. But so, too, is being able to crunch back through the snow after 15 minutes for moose rissoles and a nice glass of red.</p> <p>The ballooning can be done either “tethered” (the balloon remains attached to the ground by a rope, so it can be brought back to the starting point) or “free-flight”. The former is used for Northern Lights viewing at dusk, the latter for daytime expeditions. Also on offer are activities such as dog-sledding, fat-biking and cross-country skiing. </p>  <p><strong>The day after the tethered evening flight</strong> that began my visit, I join Gejke for a 50-mile snowmobile safari. Forests strobe past, a blur of snow-dappled trunks. For a while we track alongside the frozen Rane river, saved by conservationists to become the largest dam-free river in Sweden (they've been rewarded by the return of spawning salmon). Where the landscape opens, it simplifies into minimalist bands: unbroken snow, a charcoal smudge of pines along low hills, a vast pale sky. It's like a Christmas card painted by Rothko.</p> <p>The snowmobiles growl through a hoop mounted on the trail announcing that we have entered the Arctic Circle, just in time for lunch. In the silence afterwards it's impossible not be aware of the profound stillness, and a sense of infinite space, a balm for harried lives. “Magic-land,” Gejke says simply.</p> <p>This is wilderness as pure as it gets, you might think, until you learn that most of the forest here is plantation. Nevertheless, the number of small high-end tourism operators in Norrbotten County has increased over the past decade as they recognise the potential of a territory bigger than Portugal with only 255,000 inhabitants. In the Rane river area alone, there's Aurora, Sorbyn Lodge, Arctic Retreat and The Outpost. An hour west lie Treehotel and Arctic Bath. </p> <p>Industry is inherent to the scenery (Gejke compares it to way the Masai Mara has been shaped by cattle-grazing), but the relationship with forestry is not always easy. Since mechanisation in the 1960s, forest is more likely to be clear-cut than thinned. Felling can leave wide areas of bald, ugly hills. On a moose safari the next day, naturalist Jonas Palsson bemoans the fact that although there are more trees in Sweden than ever before, there is less old-growth forest. </p> <p>Small tourism operators might help rebalance the economy, but there are other changes afoot too. Powered by a glut of cheap, clean hydroelectricity plus almost limitless space, the region is in the throes of a “green” revolution. In 2024, H2GS will open a fossil fuel-free “green steel” plant in Boden at a cost of €2.25bn. Northvolt, founded by former Tesla chief product officer Peter Carlsson, recently launched a “gigafactory” at Skelleftea, making batteries for electric cars. Spain's Grupo Fertiberia has signed up for a €1bn green fertiliser site. Regional marketing platform Mind Dig estimates that €120bn has been invested and talks of 100,000 new jobs. Consider the infrastructure that requires. It's quite a shift for an Arctic fringe at civilisation's edge.</p>  <p><strong>For my penultimate day,</strong> I'd booked a free-flight balloon ride. The day dawns with the sun a hazy gold disk behind dense cloud, snowflakes drifting like dandelion seeds. To fly the balloon, you need the cloud base to be at least 500ft up. A nearby air force base is reporting 300ft. Bruce stares at the sky and sucks his teeth.</p> <p>Blue streaks have appeared by the time we snowmobile to the launch site on Gunnarsbytrasket lake. Helium rises at 400ft per 60 seconds. We fill and release a child's balloon; after 90 seconds it is still visible, drifting in a five-knot, north-north-west breeze. We're good to go.</p> <p>On a Swedish air force chart like marbled paper — all green forest and blue water — Bruce traces a finger along our expected flight path between two lakes. I say “expected” because no one really knows until you're up. “The beauty of balloon flying — that you have no control over your direction — is also the scary part,” he says.</p> <p>The basket is clipped on with carabiners and the balloon fills on the ground, rippling as if breathing while air is blown inside, until it lifts in a cascade of snow. This time I know what's coming but a hot-air balloon in this giddying white space still looks mad.</p> <p>Bruce runs final checks, delivers a landing briefing (bend your knees, don't evacuate until instructed). “Enjoy the flight,” he says happily. Then the burners blast, the basket drags sideways across the snow and we're away, snowmobile tracks and birch trees shrinking as we rise — 200ft, 500ft and finally our cruising altitude of 1,000ft. </p> <p>The in-flight entertainment is astonishing. As objects below shrink, the landscape grows. Scattered villages drift past in clearings. Hills peel to reveal more hills, each ridge a little more faint until they assume the gestural quality of a watercolour. Ice crystals drift, making the air itself sparkle.</p> <p>It's a magical ride. At one point we skim low over forest where two moose lumber through deep snow. Later we soar up a bank of trees, birch tips twanging on the basket, to crest a ridge that plummets suddenly. It's like the footage they capture with drones, except that you're living it.</p> <p>The wind backs west, unbroken forest lies ahead, and too soon Bruce lowers us gently into a snowbank. We've been up for 40 minutes. I'd swear it was only 10. It crosses my mind that Arctic ballooning isn't hairy-chested at all. Rather it's a way to understand this place; its scale, its silence, its understated beauty.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: James Stewart 2022 'Up, up and away on an Arctic balloon ride' FT.com 16 March.
