  "title": "United Airlines' order is 'significant win' for Boeing; Order also underscores optimism about long-haul air travel",
  "text": "<p>See also: After too little, too much, there are 'Goldilocks' conditions for air travel in 2023</p><p>\"The (United Airlines) order is a significant win for Boeing,\" with United contributing 13% of 787 deliveries through 2029 and 11% of Max deliveries, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Tuesday. For United, it is a \"necessary major widebody fleet refresh,\" Kahyaoglu said.</p><p>Widebody or twin-aisle jets offer airlines the opportunity to offer tiered services, with an eye for the more profitable and less discounted first- and business-class seats. Newer planes are also fuel efficient, an important consideration amid jet-fuel increases.</p><p>\"The order helps with investor confidence on the strength of the widebody recovery,\" Ken Herbert with RBC said in a note.</p><p>Don't miss: Southwest sees 'strong' bookings next year, vows to restore prepandemic route network</p><p>Herbert raised his price target on Boeing shares to $200, from $170, representing upside of around 7.5% over Boeing's Tuesday prices. Herbert kept the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.</p><p>\"While we do expect a positive investor reaction to the United order (and potentially other upcoming orders) the focus for investors remains on execution,\" the analyst said.</p><p>Boeing is focused on raising production rates in its commercial business amid \"continued\" supply-chain challenges, Herbert said. \" The order activity supports our view that the risk for (Boeing) remains on the supply side, with commercial demand remaining strong.\"</p><p>United announced its \"United Next\" plan in June 2021, promising to say goodbye to most of its cramped, older regional jets and replace them with fuel-efficient, amenity-laden jets that can carry more people â€” and turn more profits.</p><p>Earlier last year, the airline made a splash by planning the return of commercial supersonic flights.</p><p>Wall Street turned more optimistic about air-travel prospects in 2023, after the pandemic hampered air travel in 2020 and airlines scrambled to meet pent-up demand with less capacity.</p><p>Shares of Boeing have outperformed the broader market this year, down about 7.5% compared with losses of around 15% for the S&amp;P 500 index.
