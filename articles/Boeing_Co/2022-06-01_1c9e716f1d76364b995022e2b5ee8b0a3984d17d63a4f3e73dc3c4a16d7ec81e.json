  "text": "<p>The FT seems to be dumping on Boeing for little reason, with a harsh analysis piece (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d20df8e-aad9-4968-815a-113193bcd312\">Inside Business</a>, May 19) plus the letter by John Tippler (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b76a2c72-b4e8-4681-afae-edbc89e74b03\">May 25</a>), who saw a wing fall off a B-17 about 80 years ago.</p> <p>Have you ignored the B-17 and B-29s that helped win the second world war, the B-47 and B-52s that were important during the cold war, the 707 and 747s that started the surge in global travel? And how many of you and your readers have enjoyed safe air trips in later Boeing models?</p> <p>Plus the boost to European economy by Boeing spurring a copycat in Airbus, a state-subsidised rival.</p> <p>I have no vested interest in Boeing but your attack seems unfair to a company with such a great history.</p> <p><strong>Phillip Hawley</strong> <br><em>La Jolla, CA, US</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Dumping on Boeing ignores its great history' FT.com 1 June.
