  "title": "New Ways to Create Retirement Income and Make Your 401(k) Pay Off Like a Pension Plan; Edelman Financial Engines and other financial firms are finding creative ways to build steady income streams for retirees",
  "text": "<p>Today, more than 80% of employers offer retirement-income options, up from 50% in 2018, according to investment-consulting firm Callan LLC. In addition, a small but growing number of companies, including BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and State Street Corp., offer or are developing products that embed annuities in target-date funds, a type of investment that shifts from stocks to bonds as investors age.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is the best way to plan for retirement spending? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The latest development is from Edelman Financial Engines LLC, the 401(k) industry's largest provider of managed accounts. In a managed account, human advisers and computer algorithms manage a basket of investments for the individual for a fee, as opposed to individuals making their own investment decisions. On Thursday, the company launched a new service for workers age 55 and older, or within seven years of retirement, that will offer personalized advice built largely around creating income in retirement.</p><p>Behind the moves across the financial industry is a growing desire among employers and fund companies to entice older Americans to keep their money in their 401(k) rather than moving it to an individual retirement account at potentially another investment firm. Re-creating the reliability of a pension plan has been effective, say advisers and fund companies.</p><p>Employers benefit, too.</p><p>\"Large employers realize they are better off keeping retirees' assets in the plan from a bargaining-power perspective,\" in order to negotiate lower fees with asset managers and 401(k) record-keepers, said Jim Smith, head of workplace products and strategy at a unit of Morningstar Inc.</p><p>The new Edelman service, called Income Beyond Retirement, joins similar offerings from other managed-accounts providers including Morningstar and Fidelity Investments. All take into account a household's assets outside the 401(k) and offer retirement income planning that includes recommendations for Social Security claims. Some managed-account providers can incorporate annuities into portfolio recommendations, if the plan offers them.</p><p>Managed accounts are available in about half of 401(k) plans, according to research and consulting firm Cerulli Associates. They generally cost more than target-date funds, the all-in-one portfolios that hold about 38% of the total money in 401(k)-type plans, according to Vanguard Group.</p><p>Edelman, which charges up to 0.6% of an account balance annually for its managed-account service, is making Income Beyond Retirement available for no extra cost, said Christopher Jones, chief investment officer.</p><p>The offering comes more than a decade after Edelman began Income+, a service that aims to provide retirees a steady income. Available in about 350 401(k) plans, Income+ moves about 80% of an average 65-year-old retiree's 401(k) balance into bonds to generate a predictable payout throughout retirement. The other 20% goes into stocks to give the portfolio growth potential.</p><p>Income Beyond Retirement, in contrast, will allow retirees to invest more in stocks if they choose and vary their retirement income distributions as their needs change. Account owners can use the online program alone or with a company-employed adviser, who is legally obligated to act in a client's best financial interest.</p><p>\"A large fraction of those going through the transition from working to retirement want to talk to someone,\" said Mr. Jones.</p><p>So far, about 25 companies, including Boeing Co., Equifax Inc. and Milliken &amp; Co., have opted to make the Edelman offering available to employees.</p><p>The trend toward offering income-producing investments in 401(k)s is getting a boost from a law that went into effect in 2020 that makes it easier for 401(k) plans to offer annuities.</p><p>Shawn O'Brien, associate director of retirement at Cerulli, said the financial planning now being offered by managed-account firms is similar to what financial firms already offer those with about $500,000 to $1 million in assets. For those with higher net assets, financial advisers often offer extra services, such as insurance planning or access to alternative investments.</p><p>The fees many advisers charge are higher than those of managed accounts.</p><p>About 10% of 401(k) participants who use Vanguard Group as a 401(k) administrator are enrolled in a managed account run by either Edelman Financial Engines or Vanguard. The median age of people with such an account is 49, and their average account balance is about $200,000, Vanguard said.</p><p>Write to Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.com</p><p>New Ways to Create Retirement Income and Make Your 401(k) Pay Off Like a Pension Plan</p>",
