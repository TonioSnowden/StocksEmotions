  "title": "China Eastern Resumes Flights of Boeing 737 Model Involved in Crash; Airline says it is still inspecting 737-800 aircraft that were manufactured around the time as the plane involved in the disaster",
  "text": "<p>China Eastern said on Monday that while the airline's Boeing 737-800 planes have resumed operations, it is still inspecting and conducting assessments on a batch of the 737-800 aircraft that were manufactured around the same time as the plane that had crashed.</p><p>China Eastern's grounding of the planes was an emergency measure to run system tests on each of the 737-800 aircraft to examine airworthiness data, a representative from the airline said. The company is also conducting flight tests for 737-800 planes, the representative said.</p><p>The resumption in the 737-800's use comes even though investigators haven't finished their probe of the crash, which left no survivors and was China's worst aviation disaster since 1994. The airline had previously grounded its entire fleet of the aircraft following the March 21 crash, a decision affecting around 220 in-service aircraft across the airline group, according to aviation consulting firm Cirium.</p><p>China still hasn't resumed commercial flights of the Boeing 737 MAX more than two years after the aircraft was grounded after two fatal crashes.</p><p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China has said it would conclude a preliminary report 30 days after the crash, which would fall this week.</p><p>U.S. investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, along with technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing Co., were given approval to participate in the investigation.</p><p>The NTSB said on April 2 its team had departed for China, with investigators following similar Covid-19 safety protocols to those used during the Beijing Olympics, allowing them to begin work immediately and avoid quarantine.</p><p>Within a week of the crash, investigators discovered both black boxes onboard the aircraft. Authorities are using data recorded by the black boxes together with air-traffic control data and evidence collected on-site to conduct an investigation into the incident. It can take investigators months or more to determine the cause of a crash.</p><p>Aviation experts have been puzzled by the cause of the crash, which involved one of the fastest descents of a commercial aviation jetliner in history. The flight, MU5735, departed from Kunming in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan, plunged almost 22,000 feet in 72 seconds before slamming into a mountain while on its way to Guangzhou.</p><p>Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com</p><p>China Eastern Resumes Flights of Boeing 737 Model Involved in Crash</p>",
