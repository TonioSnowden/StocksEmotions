  "title": "Boeing Reports $3.3 Billion Loss  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>    Boeing Co. said its losses deepened in the third quarter as fresh problems with its defense business added to supply-chain and regulatory woes in its commercial-jet arm. </p><p>   The Arlington, Va., aerospace giant reported a loss of $3.3 billion, compared with a loss of $132 million in the third quarter last year. Its results were weighed down by $2.8 billion in charges related to programs including its troubled military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets. Revenue rose 4% from a year ago to $16 billion. </p><p>   The company said it generated $2.9 billion in free cash in the third quarter, keeping it on track to end the year with positive cash flow. </p><p>   The per-share of loss of $5.49 compared with a 19-cent deficit a year earlier. </p><p>   Boeing shares fell $12.86, or 8.8%, to $133.79 on Wednesday and are down 36% in the year to date. </p><p>   Jetliner deliveries have been slower than expected and the defense business continues to lose money. </p><p>   Chief Executive David Calhoun said the company was making strides in its turnaround effort but still faced challenges. </p><p>   The company has faced a series of engineering, manufacturing and regulatory problems since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, taking 346 lives. </p><p>   \"Turnarounds take time -- and we have more work to do -- but I am confident in our team and the actions we're taking for the future,\" he said in an internal message to employees Wednesday. </p><p>   The company's commercial-jet business has dealt with supply-chain disruptions, including for new engines, that have hindered deliveries of 737 jets. </p><p>   It also has faced regulatory hurdles with the latest versions of the 737, the shorter MAX 7 and longer MAX 10 models. Both have a year-end legal deadline to win certification by U.S. air-safety regulators. Without a congressional extension of that deadline, federal law may require Boeing to make costly and time-consuming overhauls to the airplanes' cockpits. </p><p>   Boeing's defense unit, which makes missiles and satellites as well as military aircraft, remains a drag on profit and cash. Rivals such as Lockheed Martin Corp. have reported higher quarterly earnings and launched large share buyback programs. </p><p>   The charges Boeing reported for the quarter stem from a series of fixed-price deals with the Pentagon it won after fierce contests. Programs, including a new training jet and a Navy drone, ran into design and cost overruns that left it nursing big losses on the contracts. </p><p>   Boeing on Wednesday said the defense unit charges were caused by increased manufacturing and supply-chain costs as well as technical challenges. </p><p>   The U.S. Air Force doesn't expect the KC-46A tanker to be fully ready until 2025. It announced an additional  18-month delay this month linked to completing and certifying the refueling system. The aircraft is flying and able to complete most missions, and Boeing continues to receive new orders for the jets. </p><p>   The two 747 jumbo jets being converted to serve as Air Force One have been delayed multiple times. </p><p>   Supplier challenges and shortages of workers with classified clearances added to Boeing's costs. Manufacturing and quality mishaps have contributed to problems with the program. </p><p>   Boeing's services arm is one of the few areas of profitable growth, mirroring those at rivals such as Raytheon Technologies Corp. as airlines have increased flying and bought more spare parts. </p><p>   Boeing said revenue from its commercial-jet arm rose 40% to $6.3 billion as it resumed deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner in late August. </p><p>   The company hadn't been able to deliver the wide-body jets, which are often used on long-haul international flights, for much of two years due to manufacturing and regulatory problems. The plane maker has benefited from resurgent demand for passenger jets as travel rebounds from the worst of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Alaska Air Group Inc. said it made its largest-ever commitment for new aircraft by exercising options to purchase 52 of Boeing's 737 MAX jets and securing rights to buy 105 more. </p><p></p>",
