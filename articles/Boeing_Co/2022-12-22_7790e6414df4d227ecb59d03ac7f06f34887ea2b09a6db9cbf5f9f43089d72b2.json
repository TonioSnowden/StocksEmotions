  "title": "Senate Tries to Get Omnibus Spending Bill Over Finish Line; Lawmakers in talks on amendment votes ahead of possible late night of voting",
  "text": "<p>The Senate could start voting on amendments later Wednesday, teeing up a late night or early morning of voting, even as they also attend an address to Congress in the evening by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Adding to the pressure, senators are looking to get out of town ahead of winter storms expected in coming days.</p><p>\"We're still working on an agreement to vote on amendments and pass the omnibus tonight,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday night. \"We aren't there yet, we're making progress.\" Once the Senate passes the measure, it would move to the House, which is expected to approve it quickly.</p><p>On Tuesday, congressional appropriators unveiled the wide-ranging spending bill for fiscal 2023 with sharp increases in military and domestic funding, with the aim to get it passed before the deadline and to go home before Christmas.</p><p>The bipartisan legislation cleared its first procedural hurdle on Tuesday, with a 70-25 vote to proceed to the bill. The bill needs 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate and a simple majority to pass. However, all senators must agree to give back debate time to hurry the process along.</p><p>The spending package drew objections from some Republicans in the Senate and House who said it was bloated and full of unnecessary spending. Critics said that leadership should have released the bill sooner rather than forcing lawmakers to vote after just days to review it.</p><p>\"They have the audacity to hold off on this thing deliberately by design, and release it in the early morning hours of Dec. 20 having scheduled a shutdown the day before Christmas Eve, and then tell us that it's somehow on us unless we eagerly jump onto it and read it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), who is opposed to the bill.</p><p>The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion the prior year. The overall discretionary price tag works out to about $1.65 trillion, compared with $1.5 trillion the prior fiscal year.</p><p>The bill, the product of months of behind-the-scenes haggling, carries an additional $44.9 billion in aid to help Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, $40.6 billion for disasters such as drought and hurricanes, as well as funds earmarked for projects in lawmakers' home districts. It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices, and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties expressed disappointment over items that weren't included and sought to amend the legislation. Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) is pushing to add in a bill that would increase compensation payments to thousands of 9/11 victims, spouses and their dependents who were excluded from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.</p><p>Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) was pushing for an amendment to the bill that would exclude earmarks, or projects requested by members of Congress for their states and districts. Other spending hawks sought to curtail the bill through changes to the legislation.</p><p>\"Amendments are being considered on both sides,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.). Generally last-minute amendments are unsuccessful.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Tries to Get Omnibus Spending Bill Over Finish Line</p>",
