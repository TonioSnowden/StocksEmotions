  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Chinese Jet Wins Key Certification",
  "text": "<p>In the meeting, Mr. Xi said the project shouldered the country's dreams and called for pooling national resources and strength to conquer core technologies, Xinhua reported.</p><p>The C919 project dates back to 2007, gathering momentum from a 2014 visit by Mr. Xi to Comac, the civil aviation group carved out of China's sprawling military-industrial complex. China would never be a true power, Mr. Xi declared then, until it built its own commercial airliner. A year later, Beijing launched its 10-year strategic \"Made in China 2025\" policy to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and increase domestic design and engineering capacity in high-tech industries such as semiconductors and aircraft manufacturing.</p><p>The self-designed and assembled airliner seats up to 168 passengers with a maximum range of about 3,450 miles -- putting it in the short- to medium-haul category of jets that are the workhorses of global aviation.</p><p>Comac will also need to secure a CAAC certificate to mass-produce the aircraft, and an \"airworthiness certificate\" for each jet. State-owned China Eastern Airlines Corp. will take delivery of the first C919 this year, Xinhua said. The airline is set to take delivery of four more of the aircraft in 2023, according to an earlier company announcement.</p><p>With a price tag of about $99 million, the C919 is cheaper than Airbus's A320neo jets that the airline bought in July at an average cost of around $128 million. Apart from pricing, factors for airlines when buying aircraft include their reliability and safety record, which take years to build, and operating costs.</p><p>With China Eastern Airlines and government-backed aircraft leasing companies committed as early buyers, the C919 is guaranteed a ready-made market, especially as its success is tied to national prestige as well as the reputation of the country's Communist Party rulers. The certification announcement comes as the party prepares to meet for a congress at which Mr. Xi is all but certain to secure a third term in power.</p><p>The scale of China's aircraft needs means Comac can cater to only a fraction of demand, with three state-owned Chinese airlines agreeing in July to buy almost 300 jets from Airbus for around $37 billion. The country's commercial fleet will double in size by 2041, with 8,485 new airplanes needed, Boeing said this year. Narrow-bodies would make up the bulk of the market, it said.</p><p>While years of work have seen China improve its ability to manufacture some components for the jet as well as to assemble the finished product, analysts say the C919 remains reliant on foreign suppliers for core parts. They include components that enable the plane to remain safely in the air -- including the engines and key flight and safety systems, making the project vulnerable to any sanctions from the U.S., which has previously targeted China's tech sector.</p><p>Comac will need at least a year to smooth out its mass production process for the C919, as well as to train crews, mechanics and build out other services for airlines, said Wang Yanan, a China-based aviation expert.</p><p>\"For the airlines operating the new aircraft, it could be a bumpy start,\" Mr. Wang said, but Comac should be aided by the fact that most of its suppliers are based in China.</p><p>Still, even with the active support of central government policy, and growing geopolitical tension between China and the West, most experts don't see the C919 taking a big slice of the domestic market in the next decade. The U.S. may have seen its national champion Boeing suffer as China has kept the Boeing 737 MAX grounded since March 2019, following two fatal crashes elsewhere, but state-owned airlines still turned to rival Airbus for their long-term fleet renewal.</p>",
