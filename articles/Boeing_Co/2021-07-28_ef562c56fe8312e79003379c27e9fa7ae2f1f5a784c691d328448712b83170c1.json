  "text": "<p>Boeing plans to cut 10,000 fewer jobs than it forecast during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic as the market recovery accelerates.</p> <p>The US aircraft manufacturer has about 140,000 employees at present and expects to stay at that level. Boeing said in October last year that it was aiming to reduce its staff from 160,000 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5c6625b-13bc-4af9-a242-d9c620f24956\">to 130,000</a> through lay-offs, voluntary departures and attrition as the Covid-19 crisis and travel restrictions devastated airlines' demand for new jets.</p> <p>“We're now seeing more stability in our staffing levels, as the commercial market recovery accelerates, our defence and government services business target growth opportunities, and we increase investments to further strengthen engineering,” chief executive David Calhoun said in a memo to employees.</p> <p>He added that the pace of the commercial market's recovery, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6b01d3e-e480-4706-ab33-34b69910058a\">trade relations with China</a> and Boeing's financial performance, would be the main factors in determining future employment levels.</p> <p>Calhoun said he expected China to allow the 737 to fly in the country by the end of 2021. China, a major market for Boeing, has yet to lift the grounding it imposed in March 2019 in the wake of two fatal crashes, although most others have done so. The move <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09024b14-6829-4e4e-84a9-3310afc5151b\">benefits China's own aircraft manufacturer, Comac,</a> and affords leverage in its relations with the US.</p> <p>Boeing plans to ramp up 737 production to 31 per month next year, from 16 a month currently, but if China withholds approval, the company will reconsider the rate ramp, Calhoun said. </p> <p>If the rate has to be cut, Boeing initially will absorb the blow to the supply chain by accepting components at the higher rate and building its inventory. </p> <p>“We put some margin into that,” he said. “In other words, we may have to take some risk ourselves.”</p> <p>The company also warned the commercial market recovery was likely to fluctuate. It depends on how the spread of the contagious Delta variant would affect Covid case rates and how quickly people are vaccinated against the virus.</p> <p>Boeing beat Wall Street expectations on earnings per share and revenue, posting its first quarterly profit since September 2019. Shares rose 6 per cent in pre-market trading.</p> <p>The company reported net income of $567m in the second quarter and 40 cents of core earnings per share. A year ago it lost $4.79 per share, and Wall Street analysts had forecast an 83 cent loss per share this quarter.</p> <p>The manufacturer brought in $17bn in revenue, compared with $16.6bn forecast by analysts, representing an increase of 44 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>Revenue was driven by improved commercial deliveries and demand for services. Boeing delivered 79 commercial aeroplanes during the quarter, the bulk of them 737 Maxes, since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1f08be2-c65c-4c39-ba48-37096be1fa5b\">manufacturing flaws</a> forced the company to stop delivering the wide-body 787 Dreamliner in May.</p> <p>Cost savings allowed the company to avoid posting a forward loss on the 787 programme, but the profit margin is “still near zero”, said interim chief financial officer David Dohnalek. </p> <p>Boeing's services business also added $4.1bn to the company's top line, a 17 per cent increase compared with the second quarter of 2020, as airlines resumed maintenance they did not need when they slashed schedules because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The company also shrank the outflow of free cash, which is cash from operations minus capital expenditures and is an important metric for investors. It reported an outflow of $705m, down from $5.6bn a year ago. The consensus estimate was for $3.7bn.</p> <p>“From the stock perspective, a shocking beat can only serve to the upside,” Baird analyst Peter Arment said in a note.</p><p>Source: Claire Bushey in Chicago 2021 'Boeing to cut 10,000 fewer jobs than forecast as recovery speeds up' FT.com 28 July.
