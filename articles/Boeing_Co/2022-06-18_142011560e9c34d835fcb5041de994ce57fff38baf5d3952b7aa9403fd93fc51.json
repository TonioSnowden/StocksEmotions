  "title": "REVIEW --- Masterpiece: When Design Takes Flight",
  "text": "<p>It takes the form of a mighty predatory bird, wings upraised and talons extended as if to seize its prey -- the departing passenger. The talons are actually buttresses and, like the roof they carry, are of smoothly curving concrete. Even before air travelers stepped beneath its projecting canopy, they had the sensation of graceful fluid motion, a sensation that continued uninterrupted through the curvilinear hall -- where the chili-pepper-red carpets of the interior offered a lively contrast with the monochrome hue of the exterior -- right up to the moment they stepped into their waiting aircraft at its far end.</p><p>With the bankruptcy of Trans World Airlines two decades ago, the Flight Center fell vacant. Narrowly escaping demolition, it reopened to the public in 2019, flawlessly restored and with elegant additions to the rear, as the TWA Hotel. One can now revel in its great spaces at leisure, and watch as they slowly change -- yet more fluid motion -- in the fading light of the day. And one can study the hotel's informative permanent exhibition on the terminal's remarkable history.</p><p>Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect best known for his soaring Gateway Arch in St. Louis, never faced a problem like the TWA project. While his academic and civic buildings stood proud and alone, the terminal faced a gallery of rivals. This was Terminal City, where 10 different airlines each built their own structures, furiously trying to distinguish themselves from their neighbors. And with little success: Most were essentially the same building, an extended horizontal block with a long glass wall facing the airport road. The TWA site was the most constricted -- at a point where the curved road sharpened to an acute angle. In fact, what seemed a liability was an asset.</p><p>Recognizing that traffic would approach his building head on, instead of obliquely, Saarinen realized that it did not have to be a flat plane but could have the three-dimensional richness of sculpture. And sculpture was his first love. He had studied it in Paris before turning to architecture, and his finest creations were themselves abstract sculptures. Such as his iconic Tulip Chair -- a single fluid shape that rose seamlessly from circular pedestal to tapered stem to flower-like seat.</p><p>As soon as he received the TWA commission in early 1956, Saarinen began studying the problem of circulation, and how to coordinate the movement of passengers, planes and luggage, all of which moved on different paths. Kornel Ringli's \"Designing TWA,\" the definitive monograph, paints an amusing portrait of Saarinen traveling with a stopwatch, obsessively tabulating how long it took a plane to taxi and to arrive at the gate, and for passengers to deplane and to collect their luggage. The miracle was that he could turn such arid data into visual poetry.</p><p>Saarinen claimed that the basic idea for the terminal came when he overturned his breakfast grapefruit, squashed it, and watched it rise into two distinct lobes. Intrigued by the idea of a form that would convey uplift in a single arresting shape, he started making models -- at first a grapefruit-size one and then ones so large he could crawl into them to study their rise and swell from every angle. At first there were eight buttresses, but this looked too much \"like a cockroach.\" In the end the whole 6,000-ton weight of the roof was brought to rest on just four thin-waisted buttresses.</p><p>Behind his back, Saarinen's engineers called the shape \"the flying brassiere.\" They could not understand why he insisted on placing raised ribs between the four lobes of the terminal, which required a thicker concrete shell. But for Saarinen, shape counted for everything: \"When the plane descends, I want the passengers to see those lines.\"</p><p>When the Boeing 707 passenger plane came into service in 1958, it launched the Jet Age, lowering both the price and the duration of air travel, in turn democratizing it. Saarinen recognized that the essence of the Jet Age was fluid, unimpeded movement, something best expressed in sculptural rather than architectural terms. The result was a seamless building without sharp transitions, neither in its paths of circulation nor its curved surfaces, where there is no more division between floor, walls and ceiling than in an oyster shell.</p><p>It is worth comparing Saarinen's building to that other great artifact of the Jet Age, the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado, which sported the biggest tailfins ever part of an object not meant to fly. Today it looks like the relic of a lost civilization, while Saarinen's building, though equally flightless, seems to have glided in this morning. The TWA Flight Center is perhaps the world's finest example of an inhabitable sculpture. And whatever it looks like -- bird of prey, squashed grapefruit, flying brassiere -- the one thing it does not look is old.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lewis teaches architectural history at Williams and reviews architecture for the Journal.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
