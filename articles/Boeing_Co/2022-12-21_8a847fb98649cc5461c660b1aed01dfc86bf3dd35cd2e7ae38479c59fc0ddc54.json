  "text": "<p>    Boeing Co. would get a reprieve from a regulatory deadline related to safety features on two new 737 MAX models under a provision included in an omnibus spending bill lawmakers unveiled Tuesday. </p><p>   The plane maker has said it might cancel the two new jets without a reprieve from a Dec. 27 deadline. Current federal law would require the new jets approved for service after that date to feature modern cockpit-alerting systems to help pilots resolve emergencies. </p><p>   The provision contained in the omnibus bill instead would require some safety enhancements, though short of what current law would require, on all 737 MAX jets to be made pending certification by U.S. air-safety regulators. </p><p>   The House and Senate are expected to vote on the legislation before the current lame-duck Congress finishes its session. The Dec. 27 deadline was imposed by a 2020 law aimed at making new aircraft safer after two MAX jets crashed, taking 346 lives. </p><p>   Boeing's earlier push to get lawmakers to attach a MAX waiver to a defense bill faltered. Without a reprieve from Congress, the latest 737 MAX jets face an unclear path. The Federal Aviation Administration had said it would stop evaluating Boeing's submissions related to the jets' current cockpit-alerting systems \"in accordance with our congressional mandate.\" The jets need FAA certification before they can fly with passengers. </p><p></p>",
