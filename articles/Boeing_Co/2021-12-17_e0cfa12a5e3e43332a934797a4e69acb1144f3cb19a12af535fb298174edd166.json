  "title": "Business News:  Airbus Wins Over Two Boeing Customers  ----  By Benjamin Katz",
  "text": "<p>   Airbus SE won deals to sell Dutch carrier KLM and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. scores of single-aisle jets, prying away two of Boeing's most loyal customers. </p><p>   Air France-KLM Group placed an order for up to 160 of Airbus's A320neo family of jets to replace aging Boeing jets at both KLM and its discount unit, Transavia. Qantas said it had agreed to buy 40 single-aisle, or narrow-body, jets from Airbus with purchase rights for another 94 jets over the next 10 years as it phases out older Boeing jets. Each carrier currently operates single-aisle jets exclusively manufactured by Boeing. </p><p>   \"We are very proud to be awarded this decision and to be part of the future of these iconic airlines,\" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said following the Air France-KLM announcement. </p><p>   The orders mark two major losses for Boeing, as the U.S. plane maker tries to rebuild its order backlog for the 737 MAX after the aircraft's long grounding following two fatal crashes. </p><p>   \"We respect our customers' decisions,\" a spokeswoman for Boeing said. \"These airlines are valued Boeing customers, and we will continue to partner closely with them to support their fleet and services requirements.\" </p><p>   Boeing's sales of the MAX had started to pick up this year after customers canceled hundreds of orders in the wake of the MAX crisis. Through the end of November, Boeing has secured 692 gross orders for the aircraft, following its recertification and its subsequent return to the skies toward the end of last year. </p><p>   Airbus had booked 542 orders for its rival A320neo in the same period, most of which have been for the European manufacturer's bigger A321 variant. </p><p>   But amid the grounding, and the pandemic, Airbus has built a sizable market-share lead in the segment. This summer, Airbus commanded a 68% share of total net orders for the two narrow-body jets, according to company figures. That compared with a 58-42 percentage split in favor of the A320neo at the end of 2018, before the MAX's grounding following two fatal crashes. </p><p>   The recovery in air traffic this year has been led by airlines operating predominantly on short-haul and domestic routes, turning the market for narrow-body jets into a critical battleground between Boeing and Airbus. Even before the pandemic, the smaller jets were the most popular offerings for both plane makers. </p><p>   Airbus is on track to retain its crown as the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker at the end of the year. </p><p>   Boeing is waiting for China to give the signoff that will allow airlines to return the MAX to their fleets and allow Boeing to restart handing over the aircraft to Chinese customers. </p><p></p>",
