  "text": "<p>“When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions!” said Claudius in <em>Hamlet</em> — a most relevant thought for aerospace and defence company Boeing to nurse at a time when the company appears to be both homeless and clueless (“Boeing accused of heading in wrong direction with move to Virginia HQ”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9df9d699-f49b-4151-8c4f-36cc488b17ac\">Report</a>, May 18; and “Ryanair chief claims Boeing managers ‘not up to the job'”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fd4a355-3665-4b56-a14f-712a6bf9d503\">Report</a>, May 17).</p> <p>Boeing is abandoning Chicago for a new headquarters near Washington, DC, in Arlington, Virginia at a time when there are a litany of problems facing the company's civil aviation division. A return to the aerospace group's spiritual home in Seattle might have sent a powerful message to customers and employees alike — a declaration that Boeing means to address its many challenges while it attempts to emerge from the 737 Max crisis and other setbacks on civil and military programmes that have dented customer and investor confidence. </p> <p>A board is a team, not a bystander, nor a corporate body frozen by groupthink. A company that ought to celebrate the engineering culture which made it a great name in aerospace is now focusing its attentions on government relations rather addressing its myriad delivery problems and building back confidence with its customers. </p> <p>It would seem that Boeing's board has subordinated common sense and chosen to be frozen by the glare of big government, which is likely to yield nothing more than scorn and reproach.</p> <p><strong>Professor Randall Peterson</strong> <br><em>London Business School <br>London NW1, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Why Boeing is looking homeless and clueless' FT.com 23 May.
