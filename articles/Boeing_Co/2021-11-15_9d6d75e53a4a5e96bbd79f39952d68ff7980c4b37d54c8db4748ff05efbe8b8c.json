  "text": "<p>Despite price pressures that have lingered longer than many investors expected, major indexes are still close to record highs. Companies that have reported earnings so far have broadly beaten analysts' expectations, supporting stock prices. Higher inflation has also suppressed the returns on government bonds, a main alternative to stocks.</p><p>\"People were quite worried about third-quarter earnings, but we've come through it very strongly,\" said Edward Smith, co-chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Rathbone Investment Management.</p><p>Advance Auto Parts and Lucid Group are slated to post earnings after the market closes.</p><p>In premarket trading, Dollar Tree added 6% after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has a stake of at least $1.8 billion in the discount retailer and plans to push it to act to boost its share price. CyrusOne shares rose 4.7% after The Wall Street Journal said the data-center operator was nearing a deal to be sold to a private-equity buyer that could value it at more than $10 billion.</p><p>Boeing shares added more than 3% premarket after the company said over the weekend that it had received new orders for its converted freighters.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.555% from 1.583% Friday.
