  "text": "<p>Joe Biden said Vladimir Putin would would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c83b28c-f66a-40b7-8891-580cee99ce21\">“pay the price”</a> for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine while praising the resistance shown by Ukrainians and the west's unity in the face of Europe's worst security crisis since the second world war. </p> <p>The US president said the Russian “dictator” had badly miscalculated the west's resolve as he announced tougher measures to isolate Russia further from the global economy, including shutting off its flights from US airspace.</p> <p>“When the history of this era is written, Putin's war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger,” Biden said a State of the Union address that was applauded by lawmakers from both sides of Congress.</p> <p>The first section of the speech was dedicated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine but Biden spent the rest of the time <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/269f909b-31b5-4f5f-883c-212767a4e494\">touting his domestic policies</a> ahead of the November midterm elections.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Kharkiv a Russian missile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86c8c97e-c6f3-4a5f-96e1-770ffb1887d9\">struck a police headquarters</a> this morning as the aerial bombardment of Ukraine's second largest city continued. The regional governor said at least 21 people had been killed and 112 wounded over the past 24 hours.</p> <p>In Kyiv, residential areas in the east and west of the city were shelled overnight as a full-scale siege of Ukraine's two biggest cities now appeared to be under way.</p> <p>The human cost of the war is growing rapidly. According to the UN, 660,000 people have already fled Ukraine as the number of civilian casualties grows and Europe faces its biggest refugee crisis this century.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Energy: </strong>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil markets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc93a656-5305-4642-9bc5-6922e33faa06\">surged to more than $112 a barrel</a> and European natural gas prices hit an all-time high.

(Fitch Ratings)</p> <h1>What else we're reading </h1> <p><strong>Political risks upturn commodity markets</strong> The Russian invasion of Ukraine has pushed up the prices of everything from oil to wheat and aluminium and highlighted the threat of raw materials becoming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf0212cf-21f3-4520-ae5f-136ce3f78afc\">a foreign policy weapon</a>. And the political risks keep mounting.</p> <p><strong>Will Japan bet on esport? </strong>Gambling in Japan is legal only for a select group of activities.
