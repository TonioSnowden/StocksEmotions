  "text": "<p>Shares in the European plane maker initially rose Thursday but ended the day down 1.3%, after it released encouraging financial results for the final quarter. Operating earnings were 11% above the median analyst estimate. Free cash flow, which is more important for aerospace firms, was almost twice as high as expected for the quarter, and amounted to 3.5 billion euros, equivalent to $4 billion, for 2021. That echoes a better-than-expected cash performance at Boeing.</p><p>Yet Airbus stock edged down as European trading got under way. The broader travel sector came under pressure amid fresh jitters about a potential war in Ukraine, but it may also have to do with the company's somewhat underwhelming guidance. Targets for 2022 include flat free cash flow and the delivery of 720 commercial aircraft.</p><p>While these aren't bad numbers, some investors were expecting more. Airbus managed to surpass its 2021 goal of 600 planes by 11 units, and was delivering 860 planes before the pandemic. Executives sounded cautious when addressing analysts Thursday.</p><p>\"We think it's not going to be easy,\" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said. \"I would not bet, if I were you, on significantly more than 720.\"</p><p>Prudence could end up paying off.</p><p>Airbus previously surprised the aviation industry by suggesting it wanted to build as many as 75 jets a month from its A320 family by 2025, compared with 45 now and 60 before the Covid-19 crisis. That led some aerospace suppliers to warn about the dangers of overproduction. Indeed, plans by Boeing and Airbus seem set to flood the market with planes when competition with secondhand planes parked during the pandemic is likely to be intense, potentially pressuring profit margins for all involved.</p><p>The plane maker confirmed Thursday that the ramp-up is on course to hit monthly rates of 65 by the summer of next year, and reiterated that market demand could potentially support 70 or 75 planes beyond that. However, there appeared to be more caution around this guidance too, with Mr. Faury emphasizing that decisions pertaining to 2024 and 2025 are still being assessed in conjunction with suppliers.</p><p>Ambitious mid-decade targets might be best avoided, since a lot of uncertainty remains around long-haul travel, supply bottlenecks and commodity prices. Airbus said that it has now managed to place the roughly 100 planes it has accumulated as inventory during the pandemic, but they won't be delivered until a year or two from now.</p><p>Conversely, 2022 could also be the year when the world finally moves on from Covid-19. That should bring catalysts to propel the stock higher, as long as the bars are easy to clear.</p><p>The 3.5 billion euro cash flow guidance for 2022 seems designed to be beaten, given that the operating earnings outlook is a much higher 5.5 billion euros and that Airbus should start receiving substantial predelivery payments from airlines, many of which were deferred in 2021. The company has restored dividends and, as Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie points out, higher interest rates may have eased the firm's pension obligations, paving the way for returning more profit to investors.</p><p>If the market again starts looking for ways to play the travel recovery, Airbus is in a position to take off.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
