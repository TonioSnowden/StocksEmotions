  "text": "<p>Figures from <strong>Heathrow</strong> out this morning show just how dismal 2021 was for the aviation industry (if there was any doubt).</p> <p>The UK's flagship airport welcomed fewer passengers last year than in the first year of the pandemic, down 12.3 per cent overall. At least 600,000 Heathrow passengers cancelled their travel plans in December due to Omicron, the airport said, blaming “swiftly imposed government travel restrictions”. </p> <p>Predictably, the airport wants the government to remove all testing for fully-vaccinated passengers “and to adopt a playbook for any future variants of concern that is more predictable, limits additional measures only to passengers from high-risk destinations and allows quarantine at home instead of in a hotel”. </p> <p>There was “significant doubt” over the speed of recovery in the industry, Heathrow said. “The aviation industry will only fully recover when [travel restrictions] are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be reimposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away,” said chief executive John Holland-Kaye. </p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>At the other end of the UK business spectrum is recruiter <strong>Robert Walters</strong>, which has been the beneficiary of a “fierce competition for talent” as well as higher wages. It said profits for the year would be ahead of expectations after a record December performance. Fees for the quarter were up 33 per cent — and as much as 48 per cent in Asia Pacific. Long may the boom last. </p> <p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> will review competition concerns in wholesale data markets, launching two market studies and gathering further information to investigate access to wholesale data. One market study will look whether complex contracts for benchmarks and indices stop switching, while the other will examine high charges for credit ratings data. The first study is due to start this summer; the second will begin before the end of the year. </p> <p>Cyber security group <strong>Darktrace</strong> upgraded its earnings guidance for the year, after a better than expected start to its financial year. Darktrace said that in the six months to December, there had been “significant improvement” in annualised recurring revenue (ARR) churn and net retention rates. The company said it now expects annual revenue growth of 42-44 per cent rather than 37-39 per cent, and adjusted ebitda margin of 3-6 per cent rather than 2-5 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Games Workshop</strong> reported a slight fall in pre-tax profits, down £3.4m to £88.2m, because of foreign exchange shifts, shipping costs and higher staff pay. But the previous year was a record for the hobbyist. </p> <p>And finally online retailer <strong>Very</strong> reported Christmas sales up 22 per cent on two years ago — though they were down 2.6 per cent on the previous year, when lockdowns drove customers online. </p> <p>Also out today are updates from insurer <strong>Phoenix Group</strong>, wealth manager <strong>Rathbones</strong> and student housing group <strong>Unite</strong>.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Airbus</strong> retained its crown as the world's largest aeroplane maker, beating Boeing for the third year in a row, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdbcd101-096c-4d51-aa61-24c082786727\">Sylvia Pfeifer reports</a>. Airbus delivered 611 revenue-generating aircraft in 2021; by the end of November, Boeing had delivered 302. But Boeing looks set to win the race for orders, securing 829 gross sales (excluding cancellations) to Airbus's 771. </p> <p><strong>Google</strong> is making a last-ditch effort to change the EU's incoming laws on Big Tech, Javier Espinoza reports from Brussels. A flurry of advertising, emails and targeted social media posts aimed at politicians and officials has popped up in recent weeks, with a step up in direct lobbying by Google and several trade associations that the search engine funds. Javier has more details <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c7527bc-7ab4-41cd-ba94-3145208da9c3\">here</a>. </p> <p>Private equity group <strong>KKR </strong>has appointed a former senior executive at asset manager <strong>BlackRock</strong> as its new chief operating officer. <strong>Ryan Stork</strong> served as BlackRock's deputy operating chief between 2019 and 2021. He joins KKR on a salary of $300,000, but the real attraction is the 400,000 restricted stocks, worth $27.7m at KKR's latest share price but worth $56m if KKR's share price hits $140 a share for more than 20 consecutive days by April 2027.
