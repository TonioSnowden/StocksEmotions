  "title": "Lockheed Scraps Aerojet  Deal Amid Antitrust Suit  ----  By Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   Lockheed Martin Corp. on Sunday said it had scrapped plans to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. after federal antitrust overseers last month sued to block the proposed $4.4 billion deal. </p><p>   Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense company by sales, had hoped to add Aerojet expertise in building rocket motors for its own missile and space systems. The proposed deal drew fire from the Federal Trade Commission and rivals who believed the combination could hinder competition. </p><p>   Lockheed Martin announced plans to buy Aerojet in December 2020. The deal followed unsuccessful efforts by Aerojet to buy a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. that launches military satellites. That triggered broader interest in acquiring Aerojet, including from private-equity firms, according to regulatory filings. </p><p>   The closing of the proposed Lockheed-Aerojet deal was pushed back several times, especially after FTC officials raised concerns. </p><p>   A lawsuit filed last month by the FTC to block the deal saw Lockheed ditch the tie-up Sunday, a decision the company said was made in the wider interest of shareholders. </p><p>   \"Our planned acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne would have benefited the entire industry through greater efficiency, speed and significant cost reductions for the U.S. government,\" Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Jim Taiclet said. </p><p>   Based in El Segundo, Calif., Aerojet is the only large, independent U.S. producer of engines for rockets and missiles. The FTC alleged that allowing Lockheed to buy Aerojet would give the defense company the ability to deny other defense contractors access to critical components needed to build competing missiles and space systems. </p><p>   \"We are confident in our future performance with an impressive backlog that is more than three times the size of our annual sales and a strong macroeconomic environment underpinning our portfolio,\" said Aerojet Rocketdyne. </p><p>   An FTC spokeswoman had no comment. The commission's four current commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, all voted for the lawsuit. </p><p>   It is the second deal to fall apart in recent days amid an FTC antitrust challenge. Nvidia Corp. and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. this month abandoned a blockbuster deal for the U.S. semiconductor maker to acquire chip-design specialist Arm, a transaction the commission challenged in December, again on a unanimous vote. </p><p>   Aerojet makes rocket boosters for missile-defense systems such as Lockheed's own Thaad program. Aerojet also works on programs such as the replacement of land-based nuclear missiles led by Northrop Grumman Corp., and the Boeing-led Commercial Crew space taxi and Space Launch System rocket. </p><p>   Lockheed is one of Aerojet's biggest suppliers, and the companies had said that after a merger they could continue to supply rocket motors that Aerojet provided to other companies such as Boeing Co. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. </p><p>   Lockheed and Aerojet also said that Lockheed's ownership could boost investment in areas such as hypersonic missiles, which fly at more than five times the speed of sound, to challenge the increasing capabilities of China and Russia, which have concerned Pentagon leaders. </p><p>   Raytheon and others said they were worried about how such pledges would be implemented. Boeing in 2019 dropped out of a bid to provide new land-based nuclear missiles for the U.S., citing a perceived advantage by Northrop Grumman after the latter in 2017 agreed to buy Orbital ATK Inc., another rocket- motor maker. </p><p>   Lockheed's plan to buy Aerojet had faced opposition from some defense contractors concerned about the future availability of the rocket motors. </p><p>   The companies had offered a series of guarantees to continue supplying Aerojet equipment to other defense contractors but said these were deemed insufficient by the FTC. </p><p>   The commission argued the deal would harm rival defense contractors and lead to unacceptable consolidation in markets critical to national security and defense. </p><p>   The FTC said it had consulted the Pentagon widely on the impact of the proposed deal. The Defense Department's views were redacted in a public version of the commission's lawsuit. The Pentagon didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Antitrust authorities four years ago cleared a similar defense-industry deal involving two other military contractors. The FTC has since taken a tougher stance on transactions involving vertical integration of companies and their suppliers, at times with notable bipartisan support, including in this case. </p><p></p>",
