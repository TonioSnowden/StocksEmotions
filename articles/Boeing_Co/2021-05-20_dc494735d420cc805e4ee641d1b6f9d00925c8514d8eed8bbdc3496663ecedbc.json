  "title": "Business News:  Discount Airline Looks to Buy  Used Planes -- at a Discount  ----  By Kristin Broughton",
  "text": "<p>   Sun Country Airlines Holdings Inc. plans to spend a large chunk of the proceeds from its recent public listing on expanding its fleet, taking advantage of low prices and a glut of planes for sale amid the pandemic. </p><p>   The Minneapolis-based discount airline, which offers vacation flights to warm-weather destinations such as California, Mexico and the Caribbean, raised about $235 million in an initial public offering in March. Founded in 1983, it was acquired three years ago by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc., which still owns about 70% of shares following the IPO. Sun Country on Monday launched a secondary offering, which could decrease Apollo's stake to around 60% if the transaction closes as planned, according to a spokeswoman. </p><p>   Sun Country only buys used planes, a strategy that allows the company to expand at a low cost, said Dave Davis, the company's chief financial officer. The airline currently owns 31 passenger planes and wants to increase that figure to about 50 by 2023. Sun Country has agreements in place to purchase three additional planes, according to the company. </p><p>   Sale prices for used aircraft have declined over the past year as airlines sold planes due to Covid-19, Mr. Davis said. \"It's a good time for us to grow, because we can get a lot of aircraft at really, really attractive prices,\" he said. </p><p>   Prices have dropped by about 20% compared with pre-pandemic levels, Mr. Davis added. </p><p>   Sun Country, which flies Boeing Co.'s 737-800 planes, will likely pay around $15 million for each aircraft, said Hunter Keay, an equity analyst covering airlines at investment research firm Wolfe Research. </p><p>   Sun Country plans to consider financing its aircraft purchases in addition to using proceeds from its IPO, it said. </p><p>   A key reason for the drop in prices is the increase in supply as companies sell off older planes because of bankruptcy filings, accelerated aircraft retirement or fleet replacement, among other reasons, executives said. </p><p>   Sun Country expects leisure travel to rebound as Covid-19 cases continue to decline. Revenue from scheduled passenger service fell 52% during the quarter ended March 31, to $54.6 million. </p><p></p>",
