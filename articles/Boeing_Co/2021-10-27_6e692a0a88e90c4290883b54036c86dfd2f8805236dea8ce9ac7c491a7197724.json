  "text": "<p>Travel is up in the air again. This time it's good news for Boeing. The US aerospace group burnt through cash flow of just <a href=\"https://investors.boeing.com/investors/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Boeing-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">$507m</a> during the third quarter, compared with negative free cash flow of $5bn in the same period a year ago. An increase in commercial aeroplane deliveries and demand for aircraft maintenance services have also helped the company to narrow its losses. </p> <p>These both bring a welcome change. Over the past two years, Boeing has lurched from one crisis to another. Its 737 Max airliners were grounded following two fatal crashes. Its wide-body 787 was also hit by production issues followed by the collapse in air travel during the pandemic.</p> <p>Though Boeing still has a long way to go before it can reclaim its former glory, its shares price shows plenty of optimism. After a one-third rally in its price over the past year, the stock now trades at 35 times 2022 earnings. Arch-rival Airbus has a multiple of just 21 times.</p> <p>Boeing executives have a tendency to talk up its prospects. Take its bullish outlook for aircraft demand. Forecasts that the aerospace market will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a4eec2-2af0-4c90-aa84-96f9019bd302#comments-anchor\">worth $9tn</a> over the next decade certainly catch the eye. But to benefit, Boeing will need to first make and deliver the planes.</p> <p>Yet Boeing continues to be dogged by manufacturing issues. Deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner remain on hold after production flaws were found. Boeing cannot say when they will resume. Supply chain constraints have not helped. Issues with the 787 are expected to result in approximately $1bn of “abnormal costs”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then there is China, a large buyer of 737 Max aircraft. Regulators there still have not approved the plane to fly again. Boeing thinks this could happen by the year's end. But this could underestimate the fickleness of Beijing's watchdogs.</p> <p>Boeing does have the advantage of a big military business to fall back on. But this is not enough to distract from the scale of its production challenges.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Boeing: aerospace group still faces headwinds' FT.com 27 October.
