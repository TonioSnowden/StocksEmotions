  "text": "<p>   Stocks jumped, continuing a tumultuous week for markets driven by uncertainty about the potential impact of the Omicron variant on public health and the economy. </p><p>   Equities rose, with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average more than recouping Wednesday's losses. Oil prices and bond yields rose. Investors already confronting rising inflation are also evaluating the likelihood that Omicron could spur changes in government or monetary policy, which has led to pronounced volatility in recent sessions. </p><p>   \"You have a demand disruption story on one hand -- Omicron -- and a monetary tightening issue with the Fed, so people are trying to figure out which way is up,\" said Austin Graff, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager of the TrueShares Low Volatility Equity Income ETF. He is bullish on energy and financial companies. </p><p>   The Dow industrials added 617.75 points, or 1.8%, to 34639.79, the largest one-day point gain since early November. The S&amp;P 500 rose 64.06 points, or 1.4%, to 4577.10, with all 11 of its sectors rising. The Nasdaq Composite gained 127.27 points, or 0.8%, to 15381.32. </p><p>   Markets have bounced around this week in reaction to pandemic headlines. On Thursday, traders focused on comments from the World Health Organization's chief scientist suggesting vaccines were likely to still offer some protection. </p><p>   Stocks lost ground Wednesday, when the first Omicron case was identified in the U.S. Some investors are waiting to adjust their portfolios until more information about the variant is available. </p><p>   Shares of Vir Biotechnology fell $1.03, or 2.2%, to $45.94. The biotech firm and partner GlaxoSmithKline said its Covid-19 antibody drug was effective against the Omicron variant in early laboratory studies. </p><p>    Dollar General shares fell $6.98, or 3.1%, to $215.81 after the retailer said profit fell in the third quarter and the company cut its full-year guidance for same-store sales. Grocery-store operator Kroger climbed $4.44, or 11%, to $44.65 after it raised its full-year guidance. Boeing climbed $14.19, or 7.5%, to $202.38 after China's aviation authority issued a directive on the 737 MAX, bringing the plane a step closer to returning to Chinese skies. </p><p>    Grab Holdings shares fell $2.26, or 21%, to $8.75 after opening higher on their first day of trading in New York. The Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery company completed a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. </p><p>    Alaska Air, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines added more than 6%. </p><p>   Weekly jobless claims rose to 222,000, lower than economists had expected, as employers held on to workers in a tight labor market. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.447%, snapping a two-day losing streak. </p><p>   Global oil benchmark Brent crude ended the day higher, gaining 80 cents a barrel, or 1.2%, to $69.67. OPEC and its allies said they would proceed with their planned production increases in January. </p><p>   Bitcoin extended losses into a third consecutive day. At 5 p.m. Thursday, the cryptocurrency traded at $56,904.50, down 0.4%. </p><p>   Overseas, the Turkish lira fell 1.4% to trade at 13.5 lira to the dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named a loyalist as the country's new finance minister. </p><p>   The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.2%. Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma jumped 21% on reports that biotech firm CSL may acquire it. </p><p>   Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was down 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.4%, Dow Jones futures were down 0.3% and Nasdaq futures were down 0.4%. </p><p></p>",
