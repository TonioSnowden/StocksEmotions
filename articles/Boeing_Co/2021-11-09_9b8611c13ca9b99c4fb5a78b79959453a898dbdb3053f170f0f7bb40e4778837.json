  "title": "General Electric to Split Into Three Public Companies; Once mighty American manufacturer will split off healthcare and then power businesses",
  "text": "<p>The move is the culmination of a yearslong process of shrinking the company. GE has already sold off its locomotive and home appliances business. It spun off its oil and gas business operations. It has also sold most of its once massive financial services arm, which hobbled the company after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>What remains today are three businessesâ€”aviation, healthcare and power. The company will now spin them off into separate publicly traded companies.</p><p>GE said it is spinning off GE Healthcare, which makes MRIs and other hospital equipment, in early 2023, with GE expecting to retain a stake of 19.9%. In 2020, the unit had about $17 billion in revenue.</p><p>It plans to combine its power unit and renewable energy unit, which make turbines for power plants and wind farms, respectively, and spin off that operation in early 2024. Those units together had about $33 billion in revenue in 2020.</p><p>That would leave behind a GE focused on making jet engines. The unit, a key supplier to Boeing Co., has been hard hit by the pandemic and had about $22 billion revenue in 2020.</p><p>GE shares rose 8.8% in premarket trading.</p><p>Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com</p><p>General Electric to Split Into Three Public Companies</p>",
