  "title": "China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 Crashes in China With 132 People Aboard; Rescue teams sent to scene of the downed plane in southern China",
  "text": "<p>Rescue teams have been sent to the area, according to state media reports. The aircraft was a 737-800 and not a Boeing 737 MAX, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.</p><p>Video footage circulated by state media showed a plume of gray smoke emerging from the crash site and what appeared to be a wing fragment lying along the side of a mountain trail with the Chinese characters for \"China Eastern\" partly visible.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the regulator said. If all aboard are confirmed dead, it would mark China's deadliest crash in nearly three decades.</p><p>The aircraft, which first flew in June 2015, had climbed to an altitude of 29,100 feet about 50 minutes into the flight where it was cruising at a speed of around 455 knots, or 524 miles an hour, according to Flightradar24 data. About 12 minutes later, at 2:20 p.m. local time, its nose suddenly angled toward the ground.</p><p>The jet then plummeted from the sky reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 ft a minute, or more than 350 miles an hour. It initially fell to an altitude of 7,425 feet when it briefly managed to gain about 1,200 ft in altitude before again diving toward the mountain, the data shows. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 ft, less than 2 minutes after entering the dive.</p><p>China's leader Xi Jinping said he was shocked by the accident and ordered a search-and-rescue mission, China's state broadcaster China Central Television reported. Relatives of some of the passengers had arrived at Guangzhou's Baiyun airport, where they were awaiting news, according to state media. The People's Liberation Army was helping in the rescue efforts, state media said.</p><p>China Eastern said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday that the plane was part of the fleet under its subsidiary based in southwestern China's Yunnan province, of which Kunming is the capital.</p><p>\"The company sends deep condolences to the passengers and crew members lost in the crash,\" it said, without specifying the death toll. The company's website switched to black and white on Monday in a sign of mourning.</p><p>CCTV, citing a China Eastern source, reported that the airline has grounded all of its 737-800 aircrafts. As of 2019, the most recent year for which the company provides data, China Eastern owned or leased 233 Boeing 737-800sâ€”accounting for more than a third of its narrow-body fleet.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman said the company was aware of initial media reports and was working to gather more information.</p><p>The 737 NG family of jets, of which the 737-800 is the most popular, has one of the best safety records in commercial aviation, with fatal accidents in which the aircraft is damaged beyond repair occurring at a relatively low rate of 0.09 per million departures over almost 25 years in operation, according to a safety study of aircraft incidents through 2020 published by Boeing in September last year.</p><p>The newer 737 MAX by comparison, had such accidents at a rate of 7.12 per million flights, with two tragic crashes occurring soon after the aircraft entered service. In China, Boeing's 737 MAX hasn't resumed commercial flying, although in December, the CAAC issued a key safety approval that brought the aircraft a step closer to resuming passenger service in the country.</p><p>Of the roughly 4,200 737-800s currently in service world-wide, 1,177 are in China, according to Cirium, an aviation data consulting firm. The aircraft type was last involved in a fatal accident in August 2020 when an Air India Express jet broke in two after overshooting the runway, killing 21 people on board including the jet's two pilots.</p><p>\"Once they're at cruising altitude, generally aircraft don't crash. Most accidents occur on the landing and takeoff phase of flight,\" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety and insurance at Ascend by Cirium. \"It happens, but compared to landings and takeoffs, it's rare.\"</p><p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was aware of the crash. \"The agency is ready to assist in investigation efforts if asked,\" it said.</p><p>Typically in the event of a crash of Boeing planes abroad, the National Transportation Safety Board is invited to participate in the investigation as the official U.S. representative, with the FAA providing technical support. Boeing and the engine supplier generally would also provide technical assistance to investigators.</p><p>China dramatically improved its air safety record after a series of fatal airplane crashes in the 1990s. In 1994, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M operated by China Northwest Airlines, which has since merged with China Eastern, crashed on its way from the city of Xi'an to Guangzhou, killing all 160 people aboard.</p><p>The most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline happened in August 2010, when a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA and operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people onboard.</p><p>The last time a large number of Chinese nationals were killed in a plane crash was in 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing off the coast off Western Australia with 152 Chinese passengers aboard.</p><p>China Eastern, based in Shanghai, had gone more than 17 years without a fatal accident before Monday. A member of the SkyTeam alliance that also includes Delta Air Lines Inc., it carries 130 million passengers a year and has a 6 out of 7 rating on airlineratings.com.</p><p>Employees at Wuzhou City Beichen Mining Co., which mines ceramic clay in Guangxi's Teng County, where the crash was reported, heard the sound of an explosion on Monday afternoon and rushed to check the mine's surveillance footage, according to manager Liao Wenhui. The footage, which later spread widely on Chinese social media, showed a large object plunging vertically into the nearby mountains on Monday afternoon.</p><p>\"It was only after the news broke that they realized what the camera had captured could be an image of the plane,\" Mr. Liao said.</p><p>Write to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com, Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com and Wenxin Fan at Wenxin.Fan@wsj.com</p><p>China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 Crashes in China With 132 People Aboard</p>",
