  "text": "<p>Ryanair expects to return to pre-pandemic passenger numbers this winter, as Europe's largest airline banks on a “very strong recovery” in travel.</p> <p>The low-cost carrier has launched 14 new routes from London for this winter and will slash the prices of its flights to encourage passengers to step back on board.</p> <p>“The recovery has been very strong,” said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. He claimed that “no airline has recovered as quickly as we have” after estimating that Ryanair carried just over 10.5m customers in August.</p> <p>He expected the airline to sustain those numbers in September and October, with the launch of new routes from Stansted and Luton airports to locations including Grenoble, Turin, Naples and Helsinki, which will help to create 500 new jobs. </p> <p>Between November to March, O'Leary expected Ryanair to hit pre-pandemic passenger levels on a monthly basis. Monthly numbers are currently running at 85 per cent of pre-Covid levels.</p> <p>The airline is then expected to exceed its annual pre-pandemic level of about 150m travellers in the year to March 2023. </p> <p>Ryanair is planning an aggressive expansion: it will receive 55 Boeing 737 Max aircraft this winter and the same number each year until 2025. Its fleet will expand to 600 aircraft by the end of the 2026 financial year, up from more than 450.</p> <p>Jet2, another UK low-cost carrier, also showed increasing confidence in the recovery in air travel as it unveiled a deal to buy dozens of Airbus A321 NEO aircraft to meet expected growth and to refresh its fleet.</p> <p>The order is for 36 planes worth $4.9bn — although the Leeds-based group said it negotiated significant discounts — that will be delivered between 2023 and 2028. Jet2 has the option to extend the deal to 60 aircraft.</p> <p>However O'Leary predicted that it would take until the summer of next year for prices to return to normal levels. “There's a lot of pent-up demand there,” he said. “The pent-up demand will take advantage of low pricing, pricing will then begin to work its way back up to pre-pandemic levels.” </p> <p>He added that the UK's traffic light system was holding back more travellers from going abroad because of the uncertainty. “The UK is lagging behind,” he told the Financial Times. “The traffic light system serves no purpose any more.”</p> <p>The Irish airline has emerged from the pandemic in a relatively robust position because of its lower cost base as well as the collapse or financial problems of rivals such as Thomas Cook and TAP Air Portugal. </p> <p>O'Leary estimated that Europe would have 20 per cent less short-haul flight capacity as a result of the pandemic devastation on the airline industry. He added that Ryanair was not encountering staffing problems for pilots and cabin crew as some of its rivals were. </p> <p>In response to reports that British Airways was considering replacing its short-haul operations with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb0d11c7-18ba-4e1b-8c0a-4b420935fe72\">low-cost ones at Gatwick</a>, O'Leary said it was “the very definition of insanity” and that “no legacy airline has ever managed” to succeed in producing a successful low-cost airline.</p> <p>O'Leary said Ryanair was in talks with Boeing to buy its 737 Max 10 jets for delivery after its current arrangement expired, but there was a “meaningful gap” between the aircraft manufacturer and the airline on price.</p> <p>He said disruption on transatlantic flights as EU ministers reinstate travel restrictions on the US would benefit short-haul travel volumes but keep prices depressed.</p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey 2021 'Ryanair predicts return to pre-pandemic passenger numbers this winter' FT.com 31 August.
