  "title": "Judge's Ruling on 737 MAX Victims Puts Boeing Settlement in Limbo; Broader view of victims' rights could figure in how DOJ prosecutes, settles white-collar crime cases",
  "text": "<p>The consequence of that breach, according to U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, is that the families can continue to challenge Boeing's settlement, which spared the company from an indictment. Boeing admitted that two employees misled the Federal Aviation Administration about the workings of the 737 MAX's automated flight-control system, which was largely blamed for pushing the aircraft into fatal nosedives in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019.</p><p>Judge O'Connor, of the U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, hasn't yet ruled on what should happen next, but the deal is now in limbo. The families have argued that he has the authority to rescind what they have called Boeing's immunity from prosecution, forcing the DOJ's hand to redo the deal with their input. The Justice Department, Boeing and the families also could appeal the judge's decisions.</p><p>\"The judge is sending a signal…how someone is considered a victim is much broader than how you, DOJ, are defining it,\" said Michael Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who is chairman of Cole Schotz P.C.'s white-collar practice. \"The DOJ is going to have to be mindful of that in the future. It gives victims greater leverage—not only in oversight, but input, into settlements.\"</p><p>The families have challenged prosecutors' failure to notify them about the settlement—also known as a deferred-prosecution agreement—under which Boeing paid $2.5 billion, admitted its employees' wrongdoing and agreed to serve a sort of probationary sentence. If the company complies with the law for 3½ years, the charges will be dropped.</p><p>The families have argued the deal misallocated blame at Boeing. The problem with the 737 MAX's development wasn't \"limited to the conduct of a few rogue employees,\" they argued in court filings. Prosecutors charged Boeing's former chief technical pilot, who was acquitted of fraud after a trial that lasted less than a week.</p><p>At a court hearing in May, federal prosecutor Jerrob Duffy said the government found \"extremely limited\" evidence of criminal intent confined to a couple of employees.</p><p>Federal judges typically interpret their authority over deferred-prosecution agreements narrowly, according to Brandon Garrett, a professor at Duke University School of Law. Judge O'Connor could reject the settlement, but he couldn't by himself rewrite its terms, Mr. Garrett said.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who met with the families in January, declined to comment on the ruling Monday, citing the continuing litigation. The Justice Department at that time apologized for not meeting with the families before finalizing the settlement in January 2021.</p><p>Judge O'Connor's ruling that the Justice Department failed to properly notify victims' families about how it would prosecute Boeing could have consequences for other white-collar criminal cases. It could mean, for instance, that prosecutors have wider duties to confer with people affected by fraud than previously thought.</p><p>That could make it much harder for the Justice Department to resolve cases, Mr. Weinstein said. \"Now DOJ has to factor in what victims want as well,\" he said. \"DOJ and victims are looking for very different things in a resolution.\"</p><p>The DOJ had argued that air-safety regulators were the victims of Boeing's effort to avoid stricter and more expensive training requirements for its 737 MAX jets, not the 346 people who died in the two crashes.</p><p>Prosecutors last year charged Boeing with defrauding the FAA and stopped short of alleging the company's wrongdoing caused the crashes. However, Judge O' Connor connected those events, writing that the tragedy was \"a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Boeing's conspiracy to defraud the United States.\"</p><p>Under the judge's reasoning, broader consultations could be necessary in other cases where companies are alleged to have harmed people but were charged with defrauding the government, such as through Medicare fraud, according to former prosecutors.</p><p>As part of the new guidelines issued last week, Justice Department officials said they would notify victims about deferred-prosecution and nonprosecution deals before resolving cases. They also updated their policies to account for newer types of fraud, including ransomware attacks or cyber-intrusion crimes that result in losses for victims.</p><p>Even before announcing the new guidelines, the department said it would pay greater attention to victims when negotiating settlements with corporations. An official overseeing the DOJ's fraud section, which handled the Boeing case, said in March that prosecutors would delay finalizing some settlements to give prospective victims more time to come forward.</p><p>That stance was reflected in payouts agreed to in a fraud and money-laundering case involving Credit Suisse Group AG. In that case, prosecutors worked with Credit Suisse's lawyers in advance of a settlement to identify the victims of the bank's crimes and create a methodology for awarding them restitution. A federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., approved the agreement in July, ordering Credit Suisse to pay $22.6 million in restitution to money managers including AllianceBernstein Holding LP and Franklin Templeton.</p><p>Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com, Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com and Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com</p><p>Judge's Ruling on 737 MAX Victims Puts Boeing Settlement in Limbo</p>",
