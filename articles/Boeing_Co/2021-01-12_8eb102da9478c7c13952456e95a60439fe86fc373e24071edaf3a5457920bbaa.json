  "title": "World News: Divers Struggle to Find Indonesian Jet's Black Boxes",
  "text": "<p>Searchers are struggling to find and reach the devices that are critical to uncovering how and why the plane -- a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 that Sriwijaya Air says was in good condition before the flight -- went down minutes after it took off from the capital, Jakarta, on Saturday, carrying 62 people.</p><p>Both the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders -- the so-called black boxes -- are critical to understanding what occurred aboard SJ182 before the crash. Flight-data recorders typically collect information ranging from basic speed and altitude to flight-control inputs by the crew, while voice recorders capture sounds and conversations from the cockpit. Together, they can help investigators determine the accident's cause.</p><p>\"We hope we can have an idea of what happened in the flight,\" said Nurcahyo Utomo, head of aviation investigations for Indonesia's national transport safety committee. \"That's basically what we expect from these black boxes.\"</p><p>It isn't unusual for the search for black boxes to take time after a plane crashes into the sea. Authorities said on Sunday that they detected pings from the boxes -- an emergency feature intended to help recover the devices after an accident. Divers dispatched to seek out the recorders were equipped with direction finders to pinpoint their location more precisely, the chief of the country's search-and-rescue agency, Bagus Puruhito, said.</p><p>The devices are designed to withstand harsh conditions. Black boxes from an Air France jet that crashed in 2009 were found nearly two years later at a depth of almost 12,900 feet. After a Lion Air jet crashed in 2018, also in the Java Sea, authorities found the memory unit from one of the plane's two black boxes within days of the accident that killed 189 people. But it took 2 1/2 months to retrieve the cockpit-voice recorder.</p><p>The Boeing aircraft involved in the 2018 accident was the 737 MAX, the newest version of the company's single-aisle jet family, which was grounded nearly two yearsago following the Indonesia crash and another one in Ethiopia in 2019. The Sriwijaya Air jet that plunged into the water Saturday is an older model that doesn't use the flight-control system largely blamed in the two 737 MAX crashes.</p><p>Among the questions investigators have is why the aircraft made an unexpected shift in direction shortly after taking off, flying northwest, which prompted air-traffic control to ask the plane to report its direction. The aircraft disappeared from radar seconds later.</p>",
