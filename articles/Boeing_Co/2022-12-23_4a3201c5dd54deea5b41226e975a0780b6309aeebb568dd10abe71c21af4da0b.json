  "text": "<p>\n  The $1.65 trillion omnibus spending bill, which would fund the government through September, includes a range of provisions of potential significance to companies and executives: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Antitrust efforts could get a boost at the federal and state levels. Fees would rise for merger filings, raising an estimated $190 million and increasing funding available for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division. In addition, state attorneys general would be better able to keep their cases in the courts where they were filed. Currently, defendants can seek to have the cases consolidated with others, potentially in more favorable venues. Other antitrust measures targeting tech companies didn't make the proposal. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The bill slows a Securities and Exchange Commission effort to impose more transparency on fees and performance of private equity and hedge funds. It requires the SEC to redo a 100-plus-page economic analysis in an early 2022 proposal, so it \"adequately considers the disparate impact on emerging minority and women-owned asset management firms.\" That would delay the SEC's rule-making. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The Food and Drug Administration gets new powers to oversee baby formula and cosmetics, and to try to ensure that drugs granted a speedy approval undergo further testing to confirm they work. The law also makes the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into a Senate-confirmed position. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The National Labor Relations Board gets a funding increase of about $25 million, raising its allotment to almost $300 million and marking the first increase in nine years. The NLRB Union has argued that the agency has been understaffed after almost a decade of flat funding. There is a catch: The NLRB wouldn't be able to use the new funds for electronic voting in union elections and must continue to use paper ballots, a rider that has been in place since the 2012 budget. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Boeing Co. got a reprieve on a Dec. 27 deadline, giving the aircraft maker more time to get federal approvals for two new versions of its 737 MAX airplane. Meanwhile, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which counts Lockheed Martin Corp. as its prime contractor, got an extra $1.8 billion in funding after cost overruns threatened to cut the Pentagon's latest order by 19 planes. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The National Aeronautics and Space Administration receives funds to award a contract for a second spacecraft capable of landing astronauts on the moon as part of the agency's Artemis exploration program, a spokeswoman said. At least two teams of aerospace companies -- one is led by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC and another that includes Northrop Grumman Corp. -- recently submitted bids to NASA to develop the vehicle. In 2021, the space agency decided to issue one lander contract, awarding it then to Elon Musk's SpaceX. That sparked a protest and lawsuit from Blue Origin, and Mr. Bezos wrote an open letter to NASA offering to cut costs on its first bid. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Retirees could postpone mandatory withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts until they are 73 -- or 75 after 2033 -- instead of 72 under current rules. Other provisions would require many new retirement plans to auto-enroll workers after 2025 and make it easier for employers to include emergency savings accounts inside 401(k) plans. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The bill would cancel sales of about 140 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve mandated by Congress between 2024 and 2027. The Energy Department last week moved to start refilling the reserves after drawdowns of 180 million barrels this year meant to tame elevated gasoline prices. The agency hopes to buy about 60 million barrels on the open market. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The legislation makes it easier for the president to release heating oil from federal reserves in the event of a regional shortage. Heating oil prices have been at the highest levels in years in the Northeast, and governors have asked Washington for help. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The Federal Aviation Administration gets additional funding to hire air-traffic controllers, part of a plan the agency has already laid out to reduce delays. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Companies based in China and Hong Kong and trading on U.S. stock exchanges would have two years to provide audits to U.S. regulatory authorities, instead of three. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- In a disappointment for cannabis companies, the spending bill didn't include the SAFE Banking Act, which would make it easier for such businesses to open checking accounts and get business loans. </p><p></p>",
