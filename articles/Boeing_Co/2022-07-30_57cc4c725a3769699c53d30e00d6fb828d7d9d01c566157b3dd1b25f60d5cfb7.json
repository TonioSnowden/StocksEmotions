  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Boeing  Clears  Hurdle on  Dreamliner  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. air-safety regulators signed off on a Boeing Co. plan aimed at addressing problems with the 787 Dreamliner, a major step before the company restarts deliveries of the aircraft, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The first 787 delivery is expected to occur within days, one of the people familiar with the mattersaid. Resuming deliveries would relieve financial pressure on the plane maker, which needs to hand over Dreamliners to generate much-needed cash. </p><p>   The Federal Aviation Administration has approved Boeing's plan for dealing with problems and carrying out fixes for the planes, but would still need to clear each 787 delivery. The company still has to submit paperwork for the first planned delivery to the regulator, said the person. </p><p>   Boeing hasn't been able to deliver Dreamliners for much of the past two years because of a series of production defects that drew increased scrutiny by its own engineers and regulators at the FAA. </p><p>   The aerospace giant said it had about 120 of undelivered Dreamliners -- which analysts estimate are together valued at more than $25 billion -- in its inventory at the end of June. </p><p>   The freeze has hobbled Boeing's cash flow, with just 14 aircraft delivered since the start of 2021. The impact has rippled across the supply chain as monthly production has fallen to a handful from a peak of 14. </p><p>   The FAA launched a broad review of Boeing's 787 production in late 2020, and earlier this year increased scrutiny by deciding to have its inspectors sign off on each Dreamliner delivery individually. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
