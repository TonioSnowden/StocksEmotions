  "title": "U.N. Report Detailing Belarus Diversion of Ryanair Flight Raises Fresh Questions; Minsk didn't give ICAO team vital information to support its claim of a terrorist bomb threat against flight carrying a wanted dissident, who was arrested",
  "text": "<p>Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary and leaders of European countries have accused Belarus of fabricating the bomb scare to illegally force the plane to land in Minsk because they knew dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich was onboard. The Boeing 737, carrying 126 passengers, was en route from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, when Belarus controllers told the pilots they had received word of a bomb aboard.</p><p>Lithuania and Poland, where the plane was registered, announced criminal probes of the events and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May it was cooperating with European counterparts because U.S. citizens were on the flight.</p><p>Evidence presented by Belarus in the spring to support its claim of a bomb threat has been dismissed by the Irish airline and many governments. Belarus's arrest of Mr. Pratasevich and actions surrounding the flight prompted the European Union to ban flights from Belarus and increase sanctions on the country.</p><p>The 36 ICAO members that sit on its governing council will meet on Jan. 31 to decide on further actions by the organization in response to the report's findings, the U.N. body said Monday. The council will also assess a complaint from Belarus that restrictions and sanctions placed on it following the incident were unlawful.</p><p>Of the report's findings, among the most notable is that Minsk air controllers told the Ryanair pilots that several airports had received the bomb threat. The report then documents that on the Sunday of the flight, no other airport was aware of having received a bomb threat, and they only found the emails days or weeks later.</p><p>A conclusion likely to be drawn by European governments is that Belarus knew other airports had received the threat because it was sent from Belarus, and not from the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, as Belarus said. Hamas has denied involvement.</p><p>The report provides the most detailed account yet of what transpired on May 23.</p><p>During the flight, shortly after Minsk air controllers informed the Ryanair crew of the bomb threat, the pilots asked where the threat came from. The controller told them that \"airport security staff… informed they received email.\" Pressed by the crew whether the security staff were in Greece or Lithuania, the controller replied, \"…this email was shared to …several airports.\"</p><p>Investigators said they were unable to establish how the Minsk air-traffic controller knew the email had been sent to other airports.</p><p>Belarus authorities say the email was received at a generic \"info@airport.by\" address of Minsk Airport that is not monitored on weekends. They told ICAO investigators it was flagged to security staff on duty by software that scans for threatening wording, and the security staff forwarded the threat to controllers within minutes.</p><p>The speedy response reported by Belarus to ICAO contrasts sharply to responses at three other airports along the plane's flight path that also received the email.</p><p>An identical email was delivered simultaneously to the Lithuanian airport authority's \"info\" email box but was only discovered the next morning, when the workweek began, according to the report. Another email, sent to the \"comment\" inbox of the airport in Sofia, Bulgaria, was discovered on that Tuesday by public relations staff.</p><p>Romanian authorities, acting on a request from investigators, two weeks later informed investigators that they also had received the threat email at the same time on May 23, in a \"contact\" mailbox.</p><p>Belarus authorities said they received two emails containing identical information about the bomb threat, the first sent at 9:25 UTC, before Minsk air-traffic control contacted the Ryanair aircraft to inform it of the threat, and a second one received at 9:56 UTC, after contact had already been made.</p><p>While Belarus provided copies of both emails, it didn't provide logs of the email server or the files containing the messages in their original format, which would have substantiated their authenticity. Belarus authorities said those files had been erased in line with their data-retention policy.</p><p>ICAO investigators said they were only able to confirm that the second email had been received based on information from the sender's email server based in Switzerland, adding that \"the receipt of the first email is crucial to explain the basis for the communication of the bomb threat by Minsk… to the flight crew.\"</p><p>Belarus didn't provide ICAO with requested information including phone records that would have provided a timeline for how information about the initial bomb threat was received and communicated between Minsk airport and air-traffic control. The Belarus Department of Aviation declined to submit details including the time-stamps and duration of calls between staff, citing legal protections in the Belarus constitution that protects the confidentiality of private citizens' telecommunication records.</p><p>Video footage from cameras at the aircraft parking stand and inside the terminal, which would have shown the disembarkation and processing of the passengers, including Mr. Pratasevich, were also not provided. Belarus authorities said the records weren't available due to the length of time that had elapsed since the incident.</p><p>Investigators said they weren't provided with a \"satisfactory rationale\" as to why the records had not been preserved in light of ongoing criminal and other investigations related to the incident.</p><p>The report also said it was unable to meet with or interview the air-traffic controller who had contacted the Ryanair flight because the employee had failed to return to work after his summer vacation and that Belarus authorities were unaware of his current whereabouts or any means to contact him.</p><p>Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com and Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com</p><p>U.N.
