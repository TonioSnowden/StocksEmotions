  "text": "<p>Airbus has secured a multibillion-dollar order for 255 single-aisle jets from veteran airline investor Bill Franke, a deal that underlines the plane-maker's forecast that the industry is poised to rebound strongly from the pandemic.</p> <p>The deal sealed at the Dubai Airshow on Sunday packages together A321neo aircraft for delivery across a stable of ultra-low-cost airlines backed by Franke's Indigo Partners, including Europe's Wizz Air and Frontier in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>The order is a sign that low-cost, short-haul airlines are rapidly rebounding from the impact of the pandemic, and comes&#xa0;as Franke is positioning his airlines to capitalise on the industry-wide disruption. </p> <p>“This order reaffirms our portfolio airlines' commitment to consistent growth&#xa0;through&#xa0;the next decade,” he said. </p> <p>The US private equity executive is considered to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9b7a98c-9dc6-426c-a828-839c0b13038d\">most successful</a> aviation investors in history. He has bought stakes in a clutch of low-cost airlines and spurred growth by cutting costs and focusing on expanding markets such as eastern Europe. </p> <p>Wizz Air, which will receive 102 aircraft, has promised to use the pandemic to expand across Europe and beyond. It made an unsuccessful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d5a82-c548-4f5a-aa06-3ad250855e72\">bid</a> for British rival easyJet this year.</p> <p>Rival low-cost carrier Ryanair signalled its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c32696e-56fc-43a5-b3d4-49daa169bcbd\">own ambitions</a> with an order from Boeing during the depths of the aviation crisis last December, and is expecting delivery of more than 200 aircraft in the coming years. </p> <p>The Wizz order includes 27 A321XLR, longer-range aircraft capable of reaching the Middle East from western Europe, following Wizz's&#xa0;launch of an Abu Dhabi-based joint venture earlier this year. </p> <p>Frontier will receive 91 new aircraft, while Latin American carriers Volaris and JetSmart will get 39 and 23 planes respectively. </p> <p>Neither Airbus nor Indigo released details on pricing. </p> <p>Airbus this weekend said it expected industry&#xa0;growth to be driven by a combination of airlines upgrading older, inefficient aircraft and the soaring demand for air cargo.</p> <p>The European plane maker forecast demand for 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft, 15,250 of these as replacements for ageing planes, by 2040.</p> <p>Airbus' forecast is less than 1 per cent lower than its previous one issued in 2019 before the pandemic, underlining its optimism that the industry is back on track.</p> <p>As the aviation industry struggles to find a quick way to decarbonise, newer aircraft offer a way to reduce carbon emissions on a per passenger basis. </p> <p>“The world is expecting more sustainable flying and this will be made possible in the short-term by the introduction of most modern aeroplanes,” said Christian Scherer, chief commercial officer at Airbus. </p> <p>“As economies and air transport mature, we see demand increasingly driven by replacement rather than growth,” he said. </p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis and Sylvia Pfeifer  2021 'Airbus wins large order from veteran low-cost airline investor Franke' FT.com 14 November.
