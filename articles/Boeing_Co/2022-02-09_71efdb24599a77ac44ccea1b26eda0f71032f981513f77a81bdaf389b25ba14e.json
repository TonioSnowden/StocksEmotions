  "text": "<p>The Americans last year filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the alleged technology transfer. They then appealed to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, which reviews deals on national-security grounds, and told the panel that Icon's technology has possible military applications.</p><p>In recent weeks, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Cfius was reviewing the deal, the sparring parties launched a series of attacks against each other.</p><p>Kirk Hawkins, a co-founder of Icon who is among the American investors fighting the Chinese investors, issued a statement to several media outlets citing a previously confidential Pentagon program looking at turning Icon's planes into unmanned aerial vehicles. That is why, he said, the U.S. government should stop the technology transfer by the Chinese shareholders. Icon's Chinese backer is Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment Co., a government-backed firm known as PDSTI.</p><p>\"It is about protecting a U.S. company from nefarious investment practices\" by China, said Mr. Hawkins, who remains on Icon's board after it ousted him as chief executive.</p><p>Icon, whose board is controlled by PDSTI, shot back in a statement to the Journal, saying its planes are unsuitable for military use and alleging Mr. Hawkins is motivated by self-interest, not national security concerns. Icon also released documents to the Journal, including one it says is a strategy document emailed by Mr. Hawkins in March 2020 outlining a plan to threaten to take the case to Cfius if PDSTI didn't buy him out of Icon.</p><p>Asked about that and another document supplied by Icon, Mr. Hawkins said that he and other American shareholders came to see that PDSTI was intent on expropriating Icon's technology. He said PDSTI offered him and other minority shareholders a buyout if they helped support a Cfius approval. They declined, he said, and decided to \"contact Cfius to ask for help.\" Neither Mr. Hawkins nor the lawyer representing him and the other American shareholders would elaborate.</p><p>PDSTI, in a filing in the lawsuit, makes reference to an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the dispute with the American investors. It has also said its investment saved Icon from collapse.</p><p>The public fight is unusual in the middle of a review by Cfius, said lawyers who specialize in such cases. The panel conducts its investment-screening behind closed doors and can recommend that the president block or unwind deals.</p><p>\"You're definitely playing with fire reporting a transaction to Cfius as an investor in the company,\" said John Kabealo, founder of Washington, D.C., firm Kabealo Law, which isn't involved in the Icon case.</p><p>While companies facing scrutiny aren't legally prohibited from discussing the process, most don't, to avoid publicizing internal information or aggravating the panel, said the lawyers who deal with Cfius cases. Disgruntled employees, industry rivals and would-be investors cut out of a deal sometimes approach the panel to try to quash a transaction, but active investors usually don't, the lawyers said.</p><p>The Treasury Department, which leads the interagency panel, declined to comment on the Icon deal. The FBI is also conducting a separate investigation into possible criminal violations related to the deal and the alleged technology transfer, as the Journal reported last month, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Icon was founded in 2006 by Mr. Hawkins, a former Air Force pilot, and by a former product-design lecturer at Stanford University. The company generated buzz for its sole product, the A5, a carbon-fiber plane capable of takeoffs and landings on water and land. Phil Condit, a former chief executive officer of Boeing Co., joined the board, though he later resigned, and is still an investor.</p><p>PDSTI's investment in Icon started out small in 2015, but by 2017, it had amassed its current nearly 47% stake, according to filings to Cfius and in the separate Delaware lawsuit by the American shareholder group, which includes Mr. Condit. Soon after, the American group said, the Chinese company began installing board members and executives and laying plans to transfer Icon's technology to China.</p><p>As the dispute spilled out in recent weeks, Icon has painted a different picture. An Icon spokesman said allegations that PDSTI had nefariously seized control are disingenuous. The spokesman pointed to a slide presentation that Icon says Mr. Hawkins made to PDSTI on a trip to Shanghai in 2017. The presentation urged PDSTI to pour more money into Icon to realize Mr. Hawkins's vision of turning the company into the \"Tesla / Apple of Aircraft,\" according to a copy of the presentation reviewed by Journal.</p><p>The second bullet point in Mr. Hawkins's alleged presentation reads: \"Change of Control. Future of ICON in PDSTI Hands.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Rebecca Elliott contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
