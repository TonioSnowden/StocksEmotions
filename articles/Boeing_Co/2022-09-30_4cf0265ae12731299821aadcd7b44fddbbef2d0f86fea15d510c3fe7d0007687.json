  "title": "China's Challenger to Boeing and Airbus Clears Major Hurdle; The C919 jet obtained a 'type certificate,' a big step for Beijing's aviation ambitions—and a reality check for how far they still have to go",
  "text": "<p>That marks a major step toward delivering jets to customers. According to CAAC regulations, the type certificate is the first in a series of three required before the aircraft can start carrying passengers, on top of a few more evaluations.</p><p>The first delivery is set for this year, Xinhua said.</p><p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the C919 team on Friday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to Xinhua. Mr. Xi said the project shoulders the country's dream and called for pooling national resources and strength to conquer core technologies.</p><p>The latest C919 certification marks a big step forward in Beijing's ambitions to challenge the duopoly of Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, but also a reality check for how far it still has to go to close the yawning gulf between them.</p><p>The Chinese-designed and assembled airliner seats up to 168 passengers and has a maximum range of about 3,450 miles—putting it in the short-to-medium-haul category, among the workhorses of global aviation.</p><p>China Eastern Airlines Corp. will take delivery of the first C919 this year, and four more in 2023, according to a company announcement. The C919 is priced at about $99 million, less than the average cost of around $128 million for the Airbus A320neo jets that the airline bought in July. Besides pricing, key factors for airlines when buying aircraft include reliability, safety record—which take years to build—and operating costs.</p><p>More to come.</p><p>Write to Rachel Liang at rachel.liang@wsj.com</p><p>China's Challenger to Boeing and Airbus Clears Major Hurdle</p>",
