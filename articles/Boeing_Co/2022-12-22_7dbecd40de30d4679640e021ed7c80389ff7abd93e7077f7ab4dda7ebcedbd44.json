  "title": "Omnibus Spending Bill Is Held Up by Title 42 Border Fight; Republicans seek amendment vote as weekend deadline nears for funding government",
  "text": "<p>Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) said he was demanding a vote on preserving Title 42 at a simple- majority threshold as a condition for allowing votes on the omnibus bill to proceed. Quick action will depend on whether all 100 senators can agree to forgo the debate time built into Senate procedures and proceed to a final vote, giving senators leverage to negotiate for amendment votes.</p><p>\"Title 42 is the one thing standing between us and utter chaos,\" Mr. Lee said on Fox News. He predicted that such an amendment would pass and warned Democrats: \"If they don't give us an up-or-down vote, this is going to be very difficult for them and will cost them the omnibus.\"</p><p>The policy, first rolled out by the Trump administration, is believed to have acted as a deterrent for some migrants seeking asylum because they could be turned back even if they asked for protection, and some border cities have seen surges of migrants in anticipation of Title 42's end.</p><p>Earlier in the evening, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said lawmakers were working on an agreement to vote on amendments and pass the omnibus bill by late Wednesday, but the standoff put that goal in doubt. Once the Senate passes the measure, it would move to the House, which had been expected to approve it quickly.</p><p>A Senate Democratic leadership aide said that the Title 42 amendment would pass the evenly divided Senate if offered at a 50-vote threshold and that its passage would act as a poison pill that would kill the omnibus bill in the House.</p><p>On Tuesday, congressional appropriators unveiled the wide-ranging spending bill for fiscal 2023 with sharp increases in military and domestic funding, with the aim to get it passed before the deadline and to go home before Christmas.</p><p>The bipartisan legislation cleared its first procedural hurdle on Tuesday, with a 70-25 vote to proceed to the bill. The bill needs 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate and a simple majority to pass. All senators must agree to give back debate time to hurry the process along.</p><p>The spending package drew objections from some Republicans in the Senate and House who said it was bloated and full of unnecessary spending. Critics said that the leadership should have released the bill sooner rather than forcing lawmakers to vote after just days to review it.</p><p>The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion in the prior year. The overall discretionary price tag works out to about $1.65 trillion, compared with $1.5 trillion the prior fiscal year.</p><p>The bill, the product of months of behind the scenes haggling, carries an additional $44.9 billion in aid to help Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, $40.6 billion for disasters such as drought and hurricanes, and funds earmarked for projects in lawmakers' home districts. It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices, and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties expressed disappointment over items that weren't included and sought to amend the legislation. Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) is pushing to add in a bill that would increase compensation payments to thousands of 9/11 victims, spouses and their dependents who were excluded from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.</p><p>Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) was pushing for an amendment to the bill that would exclude earmarks, or projects requested by members of Congress for their states and districts. Other spending hawks sought to curtail the bill through changes to the legislation.</p><p>\"Amendments are being considered on both sides,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.). Generally last-minute amendments are unsuccessful.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Omnibus Spending Bill Is Held Up by Title 42 Border Fight</p>",
