  "title": "United Airlines Orders 100 Boeing Dreamliners; The 787 order is worth an estimated $30 billion, before customary discounts",
  "text": "<p>United's order, which also includes 100 new 737 MAX jets, comes after Boeing has struggled in recent years with delivery delays, production defects and tussles with lawmakers and regulators. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun portrayed the deal as a sign of confidence and faith in the plane manufacturer.</p><p>\"Today is huge,\" Mr. Calhoun said Tuesday at Boeing's 787 factory in North Charleston, S.C., in front of new planes painted in United's livery.</p><p>The Dreamliner deal, worth $30 billion in confirmed orders before customary discounts, also is a victory for Boeing over Airbus SE, its European rival. Both manufacturers competed for the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Dreamliners vary in size but carry an average list price of $300 million, according to Boeing's most recently publicly available data. United said the terms of its agreement allow it to choose among the three Dreamliner variants.</p><p>United and Boeing didn't disclose details about how much United will pay. Deliveries of the Dreamliners United ordered are set to begin in 2024. Ascend by Cirium, an aviation consultancy, estimated the value of the deal, including the MAX jets, at about $19 billion in current economic conditions, not including any escalation for inflation.</p><p>United said about 100 of the new wide-bodies will replace decades-old Boeing 767 and 777 jets, which executives said will help reduce maintenance and fuel costs, resulting in a more fuel-efficient and profitable fleet.</p><p>The airline is also betting that long-haul international flying, which still hasn't fully recovered in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, will rebound.</p><p>United has been ambitious in restoring international routes and pushing into new markets as pandemic-era travel restrictions have receded. United CEO Scott Kirby said the deal would give United a headstart in expanding globally as airlines emerge from the pandemic. \"International is going to be really, really strong in the years to come,\" he said.</p><p>Dreamliners are popular among airlines for their fuel efficiency and ability to make new direct routes profitable, bypassing the need to connect cities via a central hub.</p><p>United shares closed 6.9% lower at $41.17, while Boeing edged up 0.5% to $187.13. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported United was close to a deal to order dozens of the Dreamliners.</p><p>The Dreamliner faced a string of manufacturing and regulatory issues that froze deliveries for nearly two years, frustrating customers including United. Boeing last summer resumed handing over new Dreamliners to customers, but still had about 115 undelivered 787s in its inventory as of the end of the third quarter, according to a securities filing. Mr. Kirby said Boeing's recent regulatory issues have resulted in better quality controls.</p><p>Both Airbus and Boeing have been dealing with delivery delays as supply chains continue to reel from major production cuts at the onset of the pandemic. Getting new planes from either manufacturer has become a challenge for airlines, constraining their growth amid revitalized appetite for travel.</p><p>United already flies the Dreamliner, and said that expanding its 787 fleet was an easier option than introducing a new aircraft type into its operations, allowing it to avoid retraining pilots as it works to bring aboard thousands of new aviators and grow the airline.</p><p>Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said that worked against Airbus.</p><p>\"This is not the result of a competition, but rather a fleet optimization around a fleet type that was already in the franchise, the 787s,\" he said in an interview. United still has an order for Airbus A350s on its books, but said it doesn't expect those deliveries to start until 2030 at the earliest.</p><p>In addition, United is also doubling down on Boeing's 737 MAX jets, building on plans it announced in 2021 to add more new, fuel-efficient jets to its fleet as part of a multiyear expansion effort. United's deal with Boeing will add 100 additional 737 MAX jets to its fleet. The purchase includes new confirmed orders as well as the exercise of previously obtained options.</p><p>Of the new 737s, 80 of those planes are slated to be the longer MAX 10 variants. United Chief Financial Officer Gerry Laderman said the airline wanted to secure its spots for new MAX deliveries as far out as 2027 and 2028.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What does the deal with United mean for Boeing's future? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The MAX 10 faces an uncertain future, however. Boeing has said it may cancel the jet without congressional action to grant it and a smaller new 737 model, the MAX 7, a waiver from a looming Dec. 27 deadline related to regulatory requirements. After that date, the jets will be required by law to feature modern cockpit-alerting systems to help pilots resolve emergencies.</p><p>The deadline was imposed by a 2020 law enacted after two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. The accidents took 346 lives, and federal lawmakers responded with legislation aimed at making new aircraft safer. Boeing executives thought they had ample time to get the new 737 models approved for passenger service by the deadline, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected.</p><p>Federal lawmakers declined to include a 737 MAX waiver in a defense bill earlier this month. Boeing is now focused on seeking a reprieve to be included in a possible spending bill before the current Congress winds down its session and Republicans take over the House next year.</p><p>United's Mr. Kirby said he is confident lawmakers would grant a waiver. But if they don't, he said United would instead order more already flying MAX 9 jets and buy more planes from Airbus. He declined to specify how many Boeing orders United might cancel without a waiver.</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at andrew.tangel@wsj.com</p><p>United Airlines Orders 100 Boeing Dreamliners</p>",
