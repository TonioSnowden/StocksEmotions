  "title": "Business News: Boeing Invests $450 Million More in Air-Taxi Venture",
  "text": "<p>Rivals Airbus SE and Embraer SA are developing electric air taxis, alongside other startups that attracted interest and investment from airlines, private jet operators and aircraft leasing companies.</p><p>Wisk was formed in 2019 through a venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk Corp., an electric aircraft maker co-founded by Mr. Page. Wisk is developing an aircraft seating three to four passengers that can take off and land vertically, flying autonomously.</p><p>Details on the latest version that Wisk intends to operate commercially -- and which likely will be larger -- are due to be disclosed later this year, according to Boeing.</p><p>Rivals like Joby Aviation Inc. and Vertical Aerospace Group Ltd. are developing piloted, taxi-style aircraft that would later transition to autonomous flight, as executives expect regulators to first certify aircraft with flight crew.</p><p>Boeing didn't provide a timeline for when the Wisk vehicle might enter service but said it would be after rivals with piloted aircraft.</p><p>\"Autonomy has to be done from the very beginning,\" said Marc Allen, Boeing's chief strategy officer. \"The extra time that will take to certify is the trade-off.\"</p><p>After closing its venture capital arm last year, Boeing, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday, is focusing its air-taxi efforts on Wisk.</p>",
