  "text": "<p>\n  By Matt Murray </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Good Morning. In today's edition, silver futures slip after settling at an eight-year high, Republicans propose $618 billion Covid-19 stimulus plan, China's top diplomat warns the U.S. against meddling in Xinjiang, and the full-faced ski mask makes a pandemic comeback. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Silver futures settled an eight-year high in New York on Monday, the latest work by a loosely knit group of speculators who congregate on social-media platforms including Reddit's WallStreetBets. Many of the stocks popular with the Reddit community declined Monday. GameStop fell 31% even as the broader U.S. market recovered some ground. The Dow industrials rose 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite 2.5%. </p><p>\n  In global trading today, Asian markets rose, European shares and U.S. stock futures were higher and silver futures slipped. </p><p>\n  -- Robinhood, which blocked trading of some volatile stocks last week after a clearinghouse asked for $3 billion to back up the trades, raised $2.4 billion from investors. The brokerage eased some trading restrictions after the infusion. </p><p>\n  -- Former Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg plans to raise $200 million for a special-purpose acquisition company targeting companies in space, defense and other industries. </p><p>\n  -- Even a single share of GameStop doesn't come without risk. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Amazon and Google are expected to report quarterly records today, driven by online holiday shopping </p><p>\n  Wall Street expects Amazon to post more than $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time after the bell today, days after Apple hit that financial milestone. Analysts forecast Google parent Alphabet to show record revenue in the fourth quarter, as online holiday spending likely drove an acceleration in digital-advertising purchases from the search giant. </p><p>\n  -- Amazon's plans for its new headquarters feature an outdoor theme, a sign that big tech companies are getting more creative with office space rather than abandoning it. </p><p>\n  -- Google agreed to pay more than $3.8 million to resolve a case of hiring and pay discrimination. </p><p>\n  -- Ford plans to use Google's Android operating system to power its vehicle display screens starting in 2023. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A major winter storm blanketed parts of the mid-Atlantic in up to 2 feet of snow Monday, delaying Covid-19 vaccinations and testing across the region. The slow-moving storm, which is expected to continue dumping snow into Wednesday, along with forecasts for a frigid February are boosting natural-gas prices. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A group of Senate Republicans outlined their roughly $618 billion coronavirus-relief offer to President Biden on Monday, as Democrats began a process that would allow them to pass Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion plan along party lines. Democrats have rejected attempts to shrink or split up Mr. Biden's proposal, which offers more money for households than the Republican alternative. </p><p>\n  -- The U.S. reached a $230 million deal with Australian diagnostics company Ellume to produce 8.5 million at-home, over-the-counter Covid-19 tests. </p><p>\n  -- The U.S. economy is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of this year, the CBO projects, but economic activity will remain below its potential until 2025. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The pandemic is wearing on essential employees who have continued working to provide for others </p><p>\n  In March, when Americans were just starting to adjust to a locked-down world, WSJ interviewed essential workers. The same group, which includes a subway operator and a home-health aide, expressed a mix of frustration, exhaustion and determination in recent interviews. Most still see the importance of what they do, and some have seized on the demand for services like home deliveries to boost their incomes. Others have stopped working, partly out of fear of getting infected. Others have no choice but to keep going and feel lucky they still have jobs. </p><p>\n  -- Delivery services are fighting to gain market share while facing increased pressure to lower commission fees and provide more protection to their workers. (▶️Video) </p><p>\n  -- Some of the largest fire departments are having trouble convincing their workers to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The haven that Turkey once represented to ethnic Uighurs fleeing China is starting to unravel </p><p>\n  Police raids and a looming extradition treaty come as Turkey seeks to boost ties with China -- a welcome investor and lender -- sparking fears that Ankara could deport Uighurs at the behest of Beijing. </p><p>\n  China's top diplomat warned the U.S. against meddling in Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong, as he attempted to steer a delicate bilateral relationship toward areas of cooperation. </p><p>\n  In other world news... </p><p>\n  -- President Biden said the U.S. would hold the leaders of the Myanmar coup accountable, but the U.S. has limited leverage. </p><p>\n  -- The Biden administration reversed a last-minute decision by former President Donald Trump to lift aluminum tariffs on the United Arab Emirates. </p><p>\n  -- Iran tested a new rocket on Monday with improved technology that could be used in its missile program. </p><pre>\n </pre><p></p>",
