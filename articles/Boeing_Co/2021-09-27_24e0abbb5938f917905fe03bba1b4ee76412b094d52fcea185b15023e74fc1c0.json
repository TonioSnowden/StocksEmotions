  "text": "<p>What are major indexes doing?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA traded up 149 points, or 0.4%, at 34,947, and had hit a intraday peak at 35,061.12 .</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was down 3 points, or 0.1%, to around 4,451.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP retreated 0.4%, or 63 points, to reach 14,984, but had been as low as 14,864.96 earlier Monday.</p><p>The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT soared 1.6% to 2,284.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow rose 33 points, or 0.1%, to 34798, the S&amp;P 500 increased 7 points, or 0.15%, to 4455, while the Nasdaq dropped 5 points, or 0.03%, to 15048.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>A move in yields was serving as catalyst for stocks Monday, with a renewed selloff for the benchmark 10-year Treasury pushing its rate briefly back above 1.5% for the first time since late June, according to FactSet. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Rising yields can increase the discount rate for tech-related stocks and highly valued sectors, while helping to boost shares of financials whose business models benefit from higher longer-end rates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS shares advanced 2.3%, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETFXLF rose 1.4%.</p><p>An energy crisis sweeping the globe was another catalyst for equities on Monday. Power shortages led to forced factory production cuts in China, while in the U.K., a shortage of truck drivers led to hoarding and declining inventories at gas stations.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their oil-price forecast to $90 a barrel, citing the impact of what it said was the most bullish hurricane in U.S. history on supply. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE jumped 3.5% as oil prices continued to press higher.</p><p>Energy disruptions have highlighted what's been a growing issue for the global economy, namely that supply hasn't recovered as fast as demand in a variety of markets. Costco Wholesale COST last week said it imposed limits on purchases of toilet paper and water.</p><p>Orders for durable goods surged 1.8% in August largely thanks to more demand for Boeing jetliners, but continued supply shortages held back auto makers and remained a drag on the U.S. economic recovery.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, in a speech Monday morning, said he was more worried that the economy wouldn't produce enough inflation rather than run too hot.</p><p>New York Fed President John Williams said he doesn't expect the recent surge in inflation to last, predicting it will fall to around 2% next year, but also said a reduction in the central bank's massive $120 billion in monthly bond purchases may be soon warranted.</p><p>Read: Fed Williams predicts U.S. inflation rate will cool to 2% in 2022</p><p>Investors also were keeping an eye on Europe. “The lack of a clear winner in Germany's election combined with a new batch of speeches from most central bankers may slow the rally down,” said Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades, in a note. “In addition, investors' eyes are cautiously monitoring the situation in China where both the energy and liquidity crises are worsening, increasing worries of a knock-on impact on other economies.”</p><p>In public health news, chief executive of Pfizer Inc. PFE said the company is expecting to submit data from late-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in 5- to 11-year-old children to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within days, raising hopes that another key patient group will soon be eligible for shots.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Swedish electric car maker Polestar Performance AB said Monday it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Gores Guggenheim Inc.GGPI&#xa0;in a deal with an implied enterprise value of about $20 billion.
