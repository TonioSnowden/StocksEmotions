  "text": "<p>   The bankrupt Air Force One supplier GDC Technics LLC has won court approval to borrow up to $800,000 in emergency financing and use cash pledged as collateral, despite objections by the company's former partner, Boeing Co. </p><p>   Judge Craig A. Gargotta of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Antonio said during a hearing that he would sign an order authorizing GDC to access up to an additional $300,000 in bankruptcy financing from Mazav Management LLC, an indirect owner of GDC through GDC's parent Oriole Aviation LLC. </p><p>   It is GDC's \"intent not to borrow any more money than absolutely needed,\" the company's bankruptcy lawyer, Jason Rudd, said. </p><p></p>",
