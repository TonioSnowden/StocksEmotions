  "title": "U.S. Lawmakers Make Surprise Taiwan Visit to Signal Support Against China; Trip draws angry response from Beijing, as Washington warns it against any attempt to change the island democracy's status quo",
  "text": "<p>\"We are going to start making China pay a greater price for what they are doing all over the world. The support for Putin must come with a price,\" Mr. Graham told Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen during a meeting in Taipei, adding: \"To abandon Taiwan would be to abandon democracy and freedom.\"</p><p>Sens. Graham and Menendez were joined by Sens. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), and Rep. Ronny Jackson (R., Tex.). Mr. Menendez was the sole Democrat. The six men arrived in Taipei on Thursday evening aboard a Boeing C-40C operated by the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>In addition to Ms. Tsai, the Congressional delegation met with Taiwan's Defense Minister and other senior officials.</p><p>The congressional trip comes as Washington seeks to reassure Taiwan of its support, while warning Beijing against any attempts to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait with military action.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has turned a spotlight on how Washington would respond in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, a democratically-governed island that China's Communist Party has never ruled but claims as part of its territory and has vowed to win control over, by force if necessary.</p><p>A spokesman for China's military, the People's Liberation Army, said in a statement Friday that the U.S. delegation had sent a \"serious wrong signal\" to Taiwan, warning against what it described as external interference in support of Taiwanese separatists.</p><p>A social-media post published by the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command said destroyers, bomber and fighters engaged in a joint combat exercise and readiness patrol on Friday.</p><p>Beijing has ratcheted up its military activity around Taiwan in recent years, sending warplanes into Taiwan's vicinity on a near-daily basis as diplomatic ties between Washington and Taipei have strengthened.</p><p>\"They are very unhappy that we are here, but that did not dissuade us from coming and it won't dissuade us in the future in supporting Taiwan,\" Mr. Menendez told Ms. Tsai on Friday in Taipei, noting Beijing's recent protests.</p><p>Using language anathema to Beijing, Mr. Menendez pointedly referred to Taiwan as a country, describing it as \"a country of global significance, of global consequence, of global impact.\"</p><p>The bipartisan delegation's trip to Taipei came as U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. was seeking to prevent a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan.</p><p>\"We are going to take every step we possibly can to ensure that never happens,\" Mr. Sullivan said at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. on Thursday.</p><p>Earlier this month, the State Department notified Congress that it had agreed to sell $95 million in equipment, training and other services to support the island's Patriot Air Defense System, the second such deal the White House has pushed through this year. China condemned the move.</p><p>This week's Congressional visit to Taiwan represents the latest of a string of such delegations during the Biden administration, in addition to another in March led by Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p>Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) was slated to visit Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter. That trip, however, was scrapped at the last minute after Mrs. Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>Reports of Mrs. Pelosi's planned trip had drawn ire from China's Foreign Ministry, which said it raised objections to the U.S. and warned of retaliatory measures.</p><p>A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi said last week that a planned trip to Asia had been postponed. It couldn't be determined if new plans were being drafted. Mrs. Pelosi has since tested negative for Covid-19 and is no longer isolating.</p><p>Any visit to Taiwan by Mrs. Pelosi would make her the highest-ranking sitting U.S. lawmaker to visit the island since then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled to Taipei in 1997 and met with then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.</p><p>Write to Joyu Wang at joyu.wang@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Lawmakers Make Surprise Taiwan Visit to Signal Support Against China</p>",
