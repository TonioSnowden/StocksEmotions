  "text": "<p>Claims Fall Slightly</p><p>New applications for unemployment assistance fell in the week ended Dec. 26, a sign of modest improvement during a holiday period clouded with uncertainty around impending changes to benefit payments.</p><p>Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits from regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, declined by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p><p>That marked a second consecutive decline from the three-month high recorded earlier in December, when virus cases were surging and more jurisdictions were bringing back economic restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>Last week's level remains higher than any recorded before 2020, although it is down sharply from a peak of nearly seven million in late March.</p><p>The four-week average of claims, which smooths volatile data, rose to the highest level since early October.</p><p>Weekly jobless claims figures can also be volatile during holiday periods because of challenges with seasonal adjustment.</p><p>\"Holiday noise and uncertainty about extensions of benefits may have held down claims last week,\" Oxford Economics economist Nancy Vanden Houten said.</p><p>She said claims remain at historically high levels, and there is a risk they could rise in the coming weeks in response to the program extensions and supplemental payments.</p><p>Other data suggest the broader economic recovery may be slowing. Household spending declined 0.4% in November, marking its first retreat in seven months, and household income fell 1.1%, according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>New- and existing-home sales declined in November from the previous month.</p><p>-- Kim Mackrael</p><p>---</p><p>TRADE</p><p>France, Germany Hit</p><p>With Wine Tariffs</p><p>The Trump administration said it would target more French and German wine and spirits with 25% tariffs starting Jan. 12, in the latest escalation in a tit-for-tat tariff fight related to a longstanding dispute over commercial-jetliner subsidies.</p><p>Among the new levies, the U.S. will for the first time apply the 25% levies on wines from France and Germany that exceed 14% alcohol, which had previously been exempt, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. had seen a surge in these higher-alcohol wines, typically from Spain and France, after wines with 14% alcohol or less were hit with tariffs last year.</p><p>Washington imposed 25% tariffs on wine from France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. in October 2019 in retaliation for subsidies they made to the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE, arguing they hurt Boeing Co.</p><p>Other items that will be subject to new tariffs are premium cognacs that cost $38 per liter and higher, and some aircraft manufacturing parts, both from France and Germany. High-alcohol wine from Spain and the U.K. weren't added to the latest list.</p><p>The U.S. and the EU have been in a long-running dispute over what each claim are unfair government subsidies to commercial-aircraft manufacturers: Airbus in Europe and Boeing in the U.S.</p><p>The battle has played out recently in tit-for-tat tariffs on consumer products.</p><p>-- Yuka Hayashi</p><p>---</p><p>PHILADELPHIA</p><p>Federal Buildings</p><p>Are Vandalized</p><p>Six people were arrested after a group vandalized several federal buildings in Philadelphia's Center City on New Year's Eve, police said.</p><p>Officers spotted about 50 people, all dressed in black, at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday at the historic U.S. Customs House, where windows were smashed, police said. Three arrests were made there and three suspects in that vandalism were arrested elsewhere later.</p><p>Vandals then hit the Federal Detention Center, where anti-police and anti-prison graffiti were scrawled, police said. A nearby sheriff's van was also defaced and several windows broken.</p><p>\"During a search incident to the arrest, they recovered numerous Molotov cocktails and some other devices which haven't been identified,\" Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Mike Cram said. Police were searching for more suspects.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
