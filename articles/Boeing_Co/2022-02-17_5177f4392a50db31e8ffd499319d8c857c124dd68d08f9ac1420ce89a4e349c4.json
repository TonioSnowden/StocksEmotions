  "text": "<p>Twice during the sorrowful documentary <em>Downfall: The Case Against Boeing</em> are moments that might have come from a corporate promo. In the first, tranquil scenes of departure lounges remind us of the scale of the miracle by which mass air travel grew so safe as to actually become dull. Later, the film maps the history of the business that made that possible: Boeing, one-time American paragon, its flawless reputation reflected in a long tradition of collective responsibility. “An excellent company,” one former employee says sadly.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two recent disasters involving the then newly launched Boeing 737 MAX laid waste to that. The film details how and why. The crash of the October 2018 Lion Air flight from Jakarta is re-enacted as if watching a flight simulator: enough to convey what it must have been like for the pilots to feel a 160,000-pound plane apparently demand its own descent into the Java Sea. The six-minute journey of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 the following March has the feel of a recurring nightmare. But nightmares are usually inexplicable. Director Rory Kennedy —&#xa0;working with producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer — is deft enough with insight and detail that even those who followed the news story will leave with fresh understanding.&#xa0;</p> <p>In January 2021 Boeing agreed to pay $2.5bn in fines and compensation to avoid criminal prosecution. Kennedy lets us be the judge, tracing events with clear outrage but a steady, diligent eye. The physical cause of the disasters proves almost fable-like. A complacent business sends a cheaply tweaked old design to compete with a fitter rival in Airbus, a shortcut requiring new, unproven onboard technology. That money-saver was, in the phrase of one insider, a “monster” in waiting.</p> <p>But it didn't end up in the air by accident. The crux of Kennedy's film is the abandonment of safety as absolute priority that once defined Boeing. The business story behind that can feel an inch simplified (while the role of the FAA feels underplayed). Still, the sudden, stark elevation of shareholder value above all is robustly spotlit, giving rise to a spivvish culture of concealment that would, as is said, have disgraced a manufacturer of washing machines. The film does not lose sight of the fact the real tragedy was the 346 lives lost on the two flights. Yet it also makes a powerful account of how even an excellent company can rot from the inside out.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Netflix from February 18</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Downfall: The Case Against Boeing — the how and why of recent disasters' FT.com 17 February.
