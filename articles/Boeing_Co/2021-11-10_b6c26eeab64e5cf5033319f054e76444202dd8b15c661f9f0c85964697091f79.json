  "title": "GE Breakup Bets on Flying Revival; Aviation company emerging from deals plays market-leading role in supplying jet engines to industry recovering from the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>The jet-engine-making business is also GE's most profitable, generating cash that the company as a stand-alone could direct toward other deals in commercial aerospace, defense and space, analysts said.</p><p>GE and its partners are the largest makers of engines for commercial jetliners and thousands of military aircraft. GE's plan to create a stand-alone aviation company follows a binge of deal making among competitors in recent years, as other industrial companies have spent billions of dollars to expand their aerospace and defense operations.</p><p>Executives have said they are betting on a return to the pre-pandemic travel trends that drove a decadelong supercycle of airlines buying new Boeing Co. and Airbus SE jets and engines.</p><p>\"We power two-thirds of commercial flights, illustrating how impactful this business is today and to the future of flight,\" GE Chief Executive Larry Culp said on an investor call Tuesday.</p><p>Analysts valued GE's aerospace unit at around $100 billion before the pandemic, and have said the division could recover to that level. \"It's a massive business, hugely important to the aviation industry and is near bottom of cycle,\" said analysts at Melius Research in a client note. The whole company is currently valued at around $120 billion.</p><p>General Electric Through the Years: The Decline of an American Powerhouse</p><p>Over the next several years, GE plans to spin off its energy and healthcare arms, after having already sold off businesses ranging from household appliances to lightbulbs, as well as its sprawling financial-services operation.</p><p>Mr. Culp plans to head the surviving company making jet engines and other aircraft parts, GE said. Given that the unit already has the largest customer base and highest margins in the aircraft-engine business, analysts don't expect the GE split-up to improve the competitive position of the aviation segment. They said the biggest benefit may be reducing corporate bureaucracy, allowing GE to prepare for improving demand.</p><p>The airline industry is still recovering from pandemic-driven travel restrictions that the International Air Transport Association, a trade group, has estimated will generate losses of $200 billion from 2020 to 2022. Global passenger traffic in September was still down 53% from pre-pandemic levels, according to IATA.</p><p>The downturn hit GE and the rest of the industry hard after a period of rapid growth. GE Aviation's annual sales totaled $33 billion in 2019, doubling over the preceding decade, but dropped by one-third to $22 billion last year as travel restrictions grounded almost half the world's fleet. Analysts expect revenues to rebound to around $28 billion this year, even though airline traffic isn't likely to recover until 2025, according to IATA and airlines.</p><p>Aviation is one of the longest-cycle industries, with aircraft lasting 25 years or more. Engines, rebuilt with spares that the manufacturers have said are the most profitable part of the business, can last 40 years. GE and its longtime partner, France's Safran SA, recently extended by a decade their CFM International engine joint venture until 2050.</p><p>CFM is the exclusive provider of engines for the Boeing 737 MAX and has a big share powering the bestselling Airbus A320neo range of workhorse jetliners. GE and its partners' market share is three times that of Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Raytheon Technologies Corp. unit that is its closest rival in the sector, according to Jefferies. Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is a distant third.</p><p>Developing new engines can cost as much as $5 billion, and manufacturers have said they are usually sold at break even or even a loss. Profits are made on sales of spare parts when they come in for repairs.</p><p>When programs turn profitable, they generate a lot of cash. In the past, much was redirected to other parts of GE, said analysts. That would change with a stand-alone GE aviation business. \"GE is already the dominant engine manufacturer,\" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, sector analyst at Jefferies. After the breakup, she said, \"cash will go towards deals.\"</p><p>GE's rivals have been pursuing their own deals. Three years ago, United Technologies Corp. undertook a split-up, spinning off its elevator and ventilation businesses. The remaining company, a producer of nose-to-tail parts for airplanes, subsequently merged with Raytheon Co. to create Raytheon Technologies Corp., combining commercial aircraft business with defense products such as missiles. Executives have said the diversification can help shield sales during downturns in the airline industry.</p><p>Other industrial conglomerates already active in aerospace have taken advantage of a brief dip in valuations to focus more on the industry. Parker-Hannifin Corp. recently prevailed over a rival bid from TransDigm Group Inc. with an $8.8 billion agreed deal for U.K.-based Meggitt PLC, a maker of aircraft wheels and parts.</p><p>GE is smaller in defense than some peers, with military sales accounting for a quarter of revenue last year compared with more than 50% at Raytheon. GE's military engines and services unit brought in $4.6 billion in sales last year, which analysts said is a useful bulwark against the depressed commercial business. The company cites providing engines for the Boeing T-7A trainer jet and F-15EX fighter as one area of growth.</p><p>GE said engines for the Lockheed Martin CH-53K transport chopper and the Army's huge helicopter replacement program are also growth opportunities. Potential future deals could include some combination with parts of Northrop Grumman Corp. or Boeing's defense arm, says Ms. Kahyaoglu.</p><p>GE is also smaller than rivals in sales to the fast-growing space sector. Though GE was responsible for the launch systems on the Apollo program and boasted a stand-alone space division, its focus now is on special materials for satellites and spacecraft.</p><p>\"Everybody is buying space,\" said Stephen Perry, managing director of Janes Capital Partners, a boutique investment bank.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>GE Breakup Bets on Flying Revival</p>",
