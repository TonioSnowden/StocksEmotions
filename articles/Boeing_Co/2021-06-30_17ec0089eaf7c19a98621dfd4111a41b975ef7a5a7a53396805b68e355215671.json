  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Even as tourists fill U.S. planes again, business travelers have been slow to return to their old habits. Airlines may be willing to spend heavily to speed things up. </p><p>\n  On Tuesday, United Airlines announced its largest aircraft order ever. On top of 50 Boeing 737 MAX-8 jets, it will buy 150 Boeing 737 MAX-10 and 70 Airbus A321neo planes -- elongated models that can carry more people. </p><p>\n  For both major aircraft makers, this offers further evidence that the Covid-19 crisis is mostly over, at least when it comes to narrow-body planes. Though there is arguably a glut of jets, fuel makes up more than one-third of airlines' operating costs, so they are always in the market for newer, more efficient models -- as long as the price is right. For Boeing, the order is a welcome sign that the MAX is no exception to this rule. </p><p>\n  However, plane makers aren't the only ones looking to reignite demand for their products. This big order by United -- a company that lost $7 billion last year -- shows that legacy airlines won't wait for high-margin premium fliers to show up. </p><p>\n  United will increase its premium seating by 75% in North American departures, compared with a 30% rise in overall capacity, and replace 200 single-class regional planes with bigger models with business cabins. The carrier said a retrofit of its mainline narrow-body fleet to include entertainment in every seat, larger overhead bins and fast wireless internet. These are bold moves and not just because tablets and smartphones make the returns on investing in back-seat screens uncertain. Business travel is down 60% from pre-Covid levels, United Chief Executive Scott Kirby said Tuesday, and some analysts expect videoconferencing to take a permanent 15% bite out of the market. Such forecasts may not account for how much airlines will spend to prevent this. </p><p>\n  The profitability of full-service airlines' hub-and-spoke business models depends on corporate travelers paying up for more comfortable cabins. While the pandemic forced them to experiment with point-to-point routes taking low-margin customers to sunny spots, the bread and butter of companies like United and Delta Air Lines and American Airlines is defending their market share at large business centers like Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas. </p><p>\n  Delta took the lead in investing in premium products before Covid-19, and remains the U.S. carrier most focused on its hubs even during the crisis. United needs to fight back, especially since budget operators like Southwest want to use the weakness of the traditional players to gain market share in premium flying. The gap between premium and economy fares has narrowed since 2018. </p><p>\n  It may be that the end result of Covid-19 is lower premium margins. Analysts are predicting airlines won't make up the shortfall in capital expenditures caused by the pandemic, but executives may end up having to spend more than expected to keep deploying larger jets. Financially weaker airlines could be worse off if they can't invest enough. Citi Research analysts find that American's earnings are the most exposed to fluctuations in global business travel. Many white-collar workers have little reason to leave home right now. United could be starting a cutthroat battle to give them one. </p><p></p>",
