  "title": "China Sets Boeing 737 MAX Directive for Flight Resumption; Regulator instructs airlines on aircraft fixes but doesn't say when the plane could return to the Chinese skies",
  "text": "<p>\"After conducting sufficient assessment, CAAC considers the corrective actions are adequate to address this unsafe condition,\" the CAAC said.</p><p>China's move comes about a year after U.S. regulators cleared the 737 MAX to resume service. China is one of a small number of countries including Russia and Indonesia that haven't recertified the plane, according to Boeing. That is hampering the U.S. plane maker's efforts to clear a backlog of more than 300 undelivered aircraft, the company has said.</p><p>\"The CAAC's decision is an important milestone toward safely returning the 737 MAX to service in China,\" said Paul Lewis, a Boeing spokesman.</p><p>Boeing's shares rose as much as around 4% in premarket trading.</p><p>Chinese airlines have around 100 MAX jets, with hundreds more on order from Boeing and aircraft leasing companies. The Chinese government orders most of its jets centrally and distributes them to airlines, which also rent aircraft. There have been no new deals for Boeing jets since late 2017.</p><p>Boeing executives have said the company is counting on the resumption of MAX services in China to underpin plans to boost monthly production of the aircraft to 31 next year from around 20 at present.</p><p>Boeing 737 MAX airplanes were grounded world-wide after hundreds of people died in two accidents: involving Lion Air in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines in 2019. The CAAC said in the directive that investigations revealed both crashes were caused after flight crew lost control during manual flight.</p><p>More Aviation News</p><p>See the latest posts on air travel, selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* FAA Chief Steve Dickson Takes On Fight Over 5G and Aviation Safety</p><p>* The Return of Commercial Supersonic Flights May Face a Sound Barrier</p><p>* Private Flying Takes Off, Boosting Demand for Business Jets</p><p>Write to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>China Sets Boeing 737 MAX Directive for Flight Resumption</p>",
