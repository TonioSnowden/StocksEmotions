  "title": "Soft Opening for Hong Kong's New Runway Shows City's Risk of Hard Landing; Long-awaited airport expansion is at the heart of plans to add aviation to global hub credentials",
  "text": "<p>Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.'s Boeing 747-400F freighter was the first to use the runway at the world's biggest air cargo hub, touching down from Shanghai's Pudong Airport at 8:27 a.m. local time.</p><p>At the time when the proposal was approved, the runway was the most expensive infrastructure project to be approved after the former British colony's 1997 return to Chinese rule. The 4,150-yard-long runway, built on 1,600 acres of land reclaimed from the South China Sea, was designed to roughly double passenger and cargo capacity at the airport when it is fully operational. The runway is also at the center of a logistics and transportation infrastructure revamp aiming to lock Hong Kong more tightly into the manufacturing heartland of southern China and to create tens of thousands of jobs in industries ranging from retail and entertainment to aircraft leasing and engineering, according government forecasts extending to 2030.</p><p>Instead, Hong Kong International Airport today hosts just 30% of the number of flights it did in 2019, the year before the pandemic erupted from China. In the first five months of this year, the number of passengers going through the airport jumped 84.5% to 547,000 from a year earlier. Still, that's a far cry from the 31.5 million it reported for the five months that ended in May 2019—the same month a three-day job fair hosted by the city's airport authority could offer about 4,000 positions at more than 40 airport-related companies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong this year regained its crown as the world's busiest air-cargo hub, though with 8% lower volume as the war in Ukraine compounded the continued impact from supply chain disruptions caused by lockdowns and other Covid control measures in China.</p><p>China is alone among major economies in sticking to a policy of trying to deny the Covid-19 virus a foothold through strict border controls, along with stringent lockdowns and quarantining anyone who tests positive. Hong Kong's leaders—including John Lee, who took over as chief executive from Carrie Lam on July 1—are caught between Beijing's party line and the demands of businesses to open up and live with the virus.</p><p>\"I'm conscious of the need for Hong Kong to remain open and convenient to travelers. But it is also important that we address the risk at the same time so that we will maintain a good balance,\" Mr. Lee said on Wednesday, repeating a pledge to ease the travel restrictions that have spurred thousands of skilled workers—Chinese as well as expatriates—to leave the city.</p><p>Hours before the runway opened, the city's government shelved a controversial flight ban policy that punished airlines for carrying passengers who later tested positive for Covid—after imposing more than 100 such penalties this year. The rule created chaos for travelers, with many stranded in transit as the last leg of their journey to Hong Kong was canceled.</p><p>While Mr. Lee has raised the possibility of cutting compulsory hotel quarantine to five days from seven, that is five days more than Singapore, London, New York or Frankfurt require. The longer restrictions are in place, the more likely companies that have stuck it out in Hong Kong will finally bite the bullet and go elsewhere.</p><p>A number of airlines, for example, are considering moving their main regional hubs, said Andrew Yuen, a transportation economist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Aviation Policy and Research Center. Whether the government lifts restrictions before they do so will determine if the city can hang on to its international aviation hub status, Mr. Yuen said.</p><p>\"It will be very difficult to get them to come back,\" he said.</p><p>Until Thursday, a flight route would be suspended if more than five travelers or 5% of its passengers tested positive with the virus. The requirement for aircrew to undergo hotel quarantine for three days also means airlines are unable to serve as many transit passengers as they would have liked.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, Hong Kong's aviation sector faced strong competition from local rivals in the Pearl River Delta. Between 2011 and 2015, on average, 70% of passengers flying from Hong Kong were headed to destinations also offered by airports in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macau, according to a Hang Seng Management College report.</p><p>To be sure, Hong Kong's government may still have some breathing room to win back the confidence of expatriates whose focus is more often on the city's attractive lifestyle and generous compensation packages than the machinations of local politics. It is helped, too, by the difficulties faced by airports and carriers in countries that have already abandoned Covid controls. British Airways this week slashed 10,000 more flights from its schedule, citing difficulties in hiring skilled employees to cope with surging post-pandemic demand for travel.</p><p>Nor was Friday's runway debut ever likely to expose new evidence of weakness in Hong Kong's aviation sector. Billed as an \"operation familiarization\" exercise, the third runway's opening coincides with the closure of one of the airport's two others for reconfiguration. The entire three-runway system is due to come online at the same time as an extended second terminal and advanced baggage handling system in 2024.</p><p>Write to Selina Cheng at selina.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>Soft Opening for Hong Kong's New Runway Shows City's Risk of Hard Landing</p>",
