  "text": "<p>The Eastern Airlines flight was flying between Kunming and Guangzhou on Monday when the airline lost contact with it, the CAAC said. The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the regulator said. The flight number was MU5735, according to state media.</p><p>The jet, which first flew in June 2015, was traveling at 457 knots, or 536 miles an hour, at an altitude of 29,100 feet at 2:19 p.m. local time when it went into a steep decline, according to Flightradar24 tracking data. The jet, while maintaining its speed, then fell more than 25,000 feet in less than three minutes to an altitude of just 3,225 feet when tracking data ended, according to Flightradar24.</p><p>The 737-800 has been involved in 22 hull loss incidents since entering into service in 1998, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which is run by the Flight Safety Foundation, an independent safety advocacy group. The aircraft type was last involved in a fatal accident in August 2020 when an Air India Express jet broke in two after overrunning the end of a runway, killing 21 people on board including the jet's two pilots.</p><p>The 737 MAX, which was grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes, is a new version of the 737 model that crashed Monday. In China, Boeing's 737 MAX hasn't resumed commercial flying, although in December, the country's civil aviation regulator issued a key safety approval that brought the aircraft a step closer to resuming passenger service there.</p><p>China Eastern reposted a screenshot of the news reported by state media on its official account on Weibo, a social media platform, without commenting further. A Boeing spokesman said the company was aware of initial media reports and was working to gather more information.</p><p>A video circulating on social media that was picked up by China National Emergency Broadcasting appeared to show a component of a plane on the ground in the vicinity of the crash.</p><p>China has improved its air safety record in recent years after a series of fatal plane crashes in the 1990s that involved local airlines.</p><p>The most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline was in August 2010, when a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA that was operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people aboard.</p><p>Based in Shanghai, China Eastern hasn't had a fatal accident for more than 17 years. In November 2004, one of its planes crashed in the city of Baotou, killing all 53 people aboard and two on the ground, according to a Xinhua report of the crash.</p><p>China Eastern is one of the 19 members of the SkyTeam alliance that also includes Delta Air Lines Inc. Carrying 130 million passengers a year, it has a six out of seven rating on airlineratings.com.</p><p>China Eastern's website on Monday appeared in black and white.</p><p>Wenxin Fan contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com and Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com</p><p>China Eastern Plane Carrying More Than 130 People Crashes</p>",
