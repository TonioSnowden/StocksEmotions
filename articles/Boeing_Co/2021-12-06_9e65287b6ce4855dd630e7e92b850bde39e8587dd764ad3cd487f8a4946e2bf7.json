  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA surged 750 points, or 2.2%, to 35,329, powered by strong point gains in UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, Home Depot Inc.HD and Boeing Co.BA</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was trading 70 points, or 1.5%, higher at 4,608.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was up by 172 points, or 1.1%, at 15,257 after touching an early intraday nadir at 14,931.61.</p><p>The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT was trading up 56 points, or 2.6%, at about 2,215, heading for its best day since Nov. 1 when it rose 2.65%.</p><p>Last week, the Dow fell 0.9%, the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.6%. Meanwhile, the The Russell 2000 last week fell into correction, commonly defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent peak.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Investors shifted into risk-on mode on Monday, shrugging off uncertainty about the virus and concerns about the Federal Reserve's policy path, even as strategists expected volatility to remain in force. Airline and cruise-ship stocks, such as United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and Carnival Corp. CCL, jumped amid encouraging comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci on the outlook of the omicron variant over the weekend. The popular exchange-traded fund U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, which contains some of those names, and is often used to reflect reopening sentiment tied to COVID, was up 7.2%.Read: Fed is widely seen backing a faster taper next week</p><p>On Sunday, Fauci told CNN's “State of the Union” that early reports about the spread of the omicron variant of coronavirus suggest it might be less severe than initially feared, but that “we have really got to be careful” when comparing it to the delta wave. Reports from South Africa show that while the virus is rapidly spreading, hospitalizations aren't.“Reports of the omicron symptoms being less severe are boosting risk appetite, but it's too soon to get carried away,” wrote Craig Erlam, a London-based senior market analyst for OANDA Corp. “I expect extreme caution to remain until the data gives us cause for more optimism.”</p><p>In a pre-emptive strike to control the virus, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced new rules on Monday in which all private-sector employers will have to mandate vaccinations for their workers, starting later this month. Under new mandates for indoor dining, entertainment and gyms, two shots will be required for people over 12. One shot will be required for children aged 5 to 11, de Blasio said.</p><p>Meanwhile, traders continued to react to the implications of jobs for November, which showed slowing growth but a steep decline in unemployment, as they prepare for Friday's release of consumer price data.
