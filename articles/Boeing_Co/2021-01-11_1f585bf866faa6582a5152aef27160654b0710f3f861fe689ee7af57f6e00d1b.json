  "title": "World News: Indonesia Closes In on Crashed Jet's Data --- After debris, remains are found; officials say they think they know black boxes' location",
  "text": "<p>Crews using helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and search-and-rescue ships spent the day looking for and retrieving debris from the Boeing 737-500 that went down minutes after taking off from the capital, Jakarta, on Saturday afternoon. Authorities have also found human body parts and expect to use DNA testing to identify the victims, a Jakarta police spokesman said.</p><p>The plane, which was on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Indonesia's Borneo island, was delayed before it took off Saturday afternoon because of inclement weather. Shortly after it was airborne, it made an unexpected turn, flying northwest, prompting air-traffic control to ask the plane to report its direction, the transportation ministry said. Seconds later, the aircraft disappeared from the radar, at 2:40 p.m. local time.</p><p>Authorities began search operations near a series of islands on the outskirts of Jakarta called Kepulauan Seribu, or Thousand Islands. They homed in on the area near Laki Island where the waters appeared of an unusual color and flow, potentially indicating an oil spill and burned fuselage connected to the crash, an air-force official, Henri Alfiandi, said in a televised interview on Sunday.</p><p>Diving teams discovered debris with the same colors as the plane as well as life vests about 75 feet below the water's surface, said Hadi Tjahjanto, Indonesia's military chief. The sign for aisle 21 of the plane was also recovered, showing seats D, E and F, according to a photograph shared by Julius Widjojono, the navy's spokesman.</p><p>Indonesia's national transportation safety committee, which is investigating the crash, sent a ship with technology that can detect underwater objects. The ship also had technology that could read signals to help locate black box cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, the committee head said. \"Hopefully it's not too long before we can recover them,\" Mr. Tjahjono said.</p><p>Finding black boxes is often challenging after a plane crashes into the sea, and searches can take weeks or years. The recorders are considered crucial to determining the cause of accidents.</p><p>Sriwijaya Air Chief Executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena on Saturday said the aircraft was in good condition when it made the flight. It was 26 years old. It isn't the 737 MAX, the newest version of the company's single-aisle jet family, which had been grounded nearly two years ago following two deadly crashes.</p><p>A relatively small number of Boeing 737-500s remain in operation around the world. Since 1993, there have been four other fatal crashes among the total of nearly 400 such jets Boeing delivered around the globe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, a database associated with the nonprofit Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>The crash renews scrutiny of Indonesia's air-safety record, which over roughly the past two decades experienced dramatic ups and downs amid steadily climbing traffic. In 2007, after a spate of deadly crashes, Indonesia and leaders of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the air-safety arm of the United Nations, signed what they described as a \"groundbreaking declaration.\" In it the government pledged to boost funding and increase oversight personnel to swiftly enhance safety.</p><p>However, the next few years saw a string of serious jetliner and turboprop crashes across Indonesia, including planes careening off runways, flying into mountains and landing on taxiways. At various times, both U.S. and European aviation authorities restricted incoming flights of carriers based in the country.</p><p>---</p><p>Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.</p>",
