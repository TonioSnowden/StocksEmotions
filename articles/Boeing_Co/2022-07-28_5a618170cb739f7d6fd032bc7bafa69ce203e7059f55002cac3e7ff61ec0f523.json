  "text": "<p>\"We do believe we're in the middle of a momentum shift,\" Chief Executive David Calhoun said in a call with analysts Wednesday.</p><p>Boeing shares closed up 0.1% at $156.09.</p><p>Production of the 737 MAX has reached 31 planes a month, up from 16 a year ago, as it deals with supply-chain challenges such as engine shortages that are also affecting rival Airbus SE, which also reported earnings Wednesday. Boeing has said it stepped up 737 deliveries in June.</p><p>Airbus cut its aircraft delivery guidance for this year and slowed production plans, citing delays in its supply chain that are holding back the European planemaker's aggressive ramp-up targets.</p><p>Executives said Wednesday Boeing appeared on the verge of receiving regulatory approval to resume deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner. A series of production issues has kept the plane maker from handing over that jet to customers for much of the last two years, leaving it with more than $25 billion of the aircraft in inventory.</p><p>A rebound in air travel has fueled airlines' continued demand for new aircraft, which Mr. Calhoun said hasn't slowed. \"While we understand the sort of recession fears that are growing out there, so far it has not impacted the aviation industry or our customers,\" Mr. Calhoun said.</p><p>In the latest quarter, profit fell to $160 million, or 32 cents a share, down from $567 million, or $1, a year earlier.</p><p>The adjusted per-share loss of 37 cents, which excludes pension charges, fell short of the 13-cent loss consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Sales fell 2% to $16.7 billion, with analysts expecting $17.6 billion.</p><p>Results of Boeing's defense business continued to be weighed down by around $400 million in charges during the quarter. This included $93 million on its Starliner space capsule. Boeing successfully launched the Starliner in May, but it has incurred higher costs after earlier failed attempts to launch and dock with the International Space Station. It also took a $147 million charge on its MQ-25 refueling drone as costs rose to meet requirements set by the U.S. Navy.</p><p>Boeing faces a possible strike at three of its defense plants from Aug. 1 after workers rejected a new contract, which Mr. Calhoun said on CNBC could disrupt deliveries.</p><p>The company said it had positive operating cash flow in the second quarter. It reiterated the target of generating surplus cash for the full year.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, Boeing has dealt with production and regulatory problems that have impeded a recovery from two crises: a nearly two-year grounding of its 737 MAX after two fatal crashes, in 2018 and 2019, and the pandemic's hit to demand for new aircraft.</p><p>A year ago, Mr. Calhoun expressed optimism, telling analysts in July 2021: \"We are turning a corner, and the recovery is gaining momentum.\"</p><p>More recently, Mr. Calhoun has said this year would mark a turning point. \"I can't measure it week by week or month by month or even quarter by quarter, but I know the year is going to be substantially better,\" he said at a June analyst event.</p><p>Mr. Calhoun said Wednesday he couldn't predict when Boeing would be in a position to increase its 737 MAX production rates, citing supply constraints as a barrier to ramping up. \"If I thought I had an engine supply, I'd do it today,\" he said.</p><p>Boeing has had to slow production of its narrow-body aircraft this year due to supply bottlenecks, and getting stored MAX jets out of inventory has taken longer than the company anticipated. Scores of the planes have been in storage since the MAX grounding. Many of the MAX jets are bound for customers in China, which hasn't allowed the aircraft to return to service in the country.</p><p>After previously saying it expected to deliver about 500 of 737 MAX jets by the end of the year, Boeing finance chief Brian West on Wednesday said the company now estimates it will deliver closer to 400 of the aircraft by the end of 2022. As of June 30, the company had handed over 181 of the aircraft to customers.</p><p>Airbus will deliver 700 aircraft this year, 20 fewer than it had initially planned, it said Wednesday. Airbus has been producing its A320 narrow-body family at a monthly rate of about 50, with a goal of reaching 75 by 2025. It said production would increase more slowly through 2023. Production of the A320 will now reach a rate of 65 a month in early 2024, about six months behind schedule. The A320 compete with Boeing's 737 MAX.</p><p>\"We are late on the trajectory we had given to ourselves,\" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on a call with reporters, citing the supply chain challenges.</p><p>One of the biggest bottlenecks has been the supply of engines, with both CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co. and France's Safran SA, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of Raytheon Technologies Corp. -- the two engine providers for the A320 -- running behind schedule. The delays have led Airbus to produce and store 26 so-called gliders, ready-built aircraft waiting for turbines, as at the end of June. Mr. Faury said he expects that backlog to clear by the end of the year.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
