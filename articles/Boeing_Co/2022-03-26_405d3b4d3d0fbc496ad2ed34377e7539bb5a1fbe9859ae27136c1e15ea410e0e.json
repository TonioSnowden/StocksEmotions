  "text": "<p>As acting FAA chief, Mr. Nolen will confront a host of aviation challenges, including maintaining airline safety as carriers increase operations to meet surging demand, approving deliveries of Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner amid various production lapses and assisting Chinese authorities' investigation of a recent crash of a U.S.-made plane in that country.</p><p>The FAA's announcement that Mr. Nolen will take on the administrator job on an interim basis confirmed earlier reporting by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The FAA said Saturday the Biden administration is conducting a search for a nominee who would lead the agency on a permanent basis, a position that carries a five-year term and must be confirmed by the Senate. </p><p>The current administrator, Mr. Dickson, was appointed to the role by then-President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate in 2019.</p><p>\"Billy Nolen has extensive expertise in aviation,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.</p><p>The FAA said the agency's deputy administrator, Bradley Mims, will take on an expanded role during the interim period, focusing on workforce issues and airports.</p><p>Mr. Nolen, or whoever eventually wins Senate confirmation as FAA administrator, would take the controls of an air-safety agency trying to emerge from the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. The accidents, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, took 346 lives and prompted regulatory, congressional and criminal investigations.</p><p>The MAX crashes exposed breakdowns in how the FAA approved a flight-control system later blamed for sending the jets into fatal nosedives. The FAA has been working to implement a new law governing how regulators approve new aircraft as safe for passengers. </p><p>The agency also has initiatives under way related to electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft, drones and space launches. </p><p>Mr. Nolen served tours of duty in the U.S. Army as an airplane and helicopter pilot and safety officer, in addition to his professional aviation experience, according to the FAA.</p><p>Mr. Dickson, the current administrator of the air-safety agency, is a pilot and former Delta Air Lines Inc. executive. In February, he said he would step down March 31, citing personal reasons for the planned departure. </p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>FAA Names Safety Chief Billy Nolen as Acting Leader</p>",
