  "title": "The Surprise Winners From Biden's $2 Trillion Spending Bill: Wall Street and Tobacco Companies; Tobacco companies, banks and private-equity firms are among winners, although package still includes increased levies",
  "text": "<p>Lobbyists for private equity killed a $14 billion tax increase after an advocacy campaign that helped persuade Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) that it would harm business in her state.</p><p>Tobacco companies and convenience stores scaled back a nearly $100 billion tax increase on nicotine products after convincing key Democrats that the new taxes would fall heavily on low-income Americans. The bill that passed the House raises nicotine taxes by about $9 billion over a decade, largely affecting the vaping industry.</p><p>Wall Street firms defeated efforts by progressive Democrats to impose a new tax on financial transactions by arguing it would hurt the economic recovery.</p><p>While the roughly $2 trillion spending bill still includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on businesses, the wins by many lobbies show the continued influence of business in Washington despite growing ranks of progressives in the Democratic Party.</p><p>\"The pro-corporate strain is still strong within the party,\" said Adam Jentleson, who worked as a senior strategist to Harry Reid when the Nevada Democrat was Senate majority leader. \"The pro-worker side continues to gain strength, but the pro-corporate side has the power,\" he said.</p><p>The changes that companies made to Mr. Biden's domestic-policy legislation came after a surge in lobbying this year.</p><p>Companies and interest groups spent a record total of $903 million on lobbying in the most recent quarter ending Sept. 30, according to an analysis of public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization tracking the amount of money in politics. That was an almost 5% increase over lobbying spending during the same period in the final year of Mr. Trump's presidency.</p><p>The lobbying industry usually gets a boost when Democrats gain power in government as companies step up efforts to block new taxes and regulations.</p><p>This year lobbying has been especially pitched as businesses worry about hostile legislation from progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.)</p><p>Business groups aren't the only ones who scored wins.</p><p>Lobbyists for organized labor secured priorities, including a tax change allowing members to deduct a portion of their union dues. The United Auto Workers also benefits from a provision that gives consumers a bigger tax credit on electric vehicles built by union members.</p><p>Trial lawyers got language that permits them to deduct certain expenses for cases taken on a contingency basis in the year in which the costs were incurred.</p><p>There was a smattering of other industry-specific wins. Home Depot Inc. and other retailers got an extension of tax incentives for purchases of energy-efficient appliances and other home products, and local newspapers and television stations secured a refundable payroll tax credit to hire and retain more journalists.</p><p>The legislation includes much of Mr. Biden's domestic agenda, such as measures aimed at slowing global warming and strengthening the social safety net. After passing the House, the legislation now goes to the Senate for consideration.</p><p>Democratic leaders seek to fund much of the new spending with increased taxes on businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. and other oil-and-gas companies, U.S. multinationals such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., and companies that buy back shares of their own stock.</p><p>One provision raises funds from some for-profit prison companies, such as GEO Group Inc., by subjecting their earnings to taxes.</p><p>Some big pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc. could see profits curtailed because of a measure that allows Medicare to negotiate the prices of some of the prescription drugs it buys for seniors. The impact of the provision is limited to drug companies whose products have been on the market for years.</p><p>Suzanne Clark, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the bill improved for industry, citing the business lobby's defeat of Mr. Biden's plans to increase taxes on corporate profits and capital gains.</p><p>The Chamber continued to oppose the bill. On Thursday, it announced a new round of advertisements calling on Congress to defeat it because of concerns that the new spending could fuel inflation.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest winner in the House bill was private equity.</p><p>For years, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and others have complained that private-equity managers at firms such as Blackstone Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc. pay tax at the long-term capital-gains rate, rather than the higher rate applied to individual income.</p><p>When Mr. Biden took office, private equity knew it had a target on its back. It launched a lobbying effort to convince a few dozen centrist Democrats that increased taxes for private equity would lower the amount of money invested in small businesses and real-estate development in their states.</p><p>One focus of the effort was Ms. Sinema. The centrist Democratic senator has wielded outsize influence over Mr. Biden's agenda because Democratic leaders must win united Democratic support to overcome the opposition of all 50 Republican senators.</p><p>Using advanced digital tactics, lobbyists identified a small circle of Ms. Sinema's political advisers, staff and campaign donors and purchased advertisements on their Twitter and Facebook pages that repeated the argument that increasing private-equity taxes would hurt investment and jobs in Arizona, according to information reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>\"As of 2020, 86% of private equity investments went to small businesses,\" said one of the social-media ads funded by the industry's trade association, the American Investment Council. \"Private Equity is directly supporting 138 small businesses in Arizona.\"</p><p>Lobbyists for private-equity firms said they worked with business leaders in Arizona to write opinion pieces for local media outlets to catch Ms. Sinema's attention.</p><p>\"Raising taxes on individuals and small businesses who contribute funds or sweat equity to a project will diminish the incentive to take on risk,\" said a piece by Suzanne Kinney, the president of the Arizona chapter of a commercial real-estate development association.</p><p>In October, the National Venture Capital Association, which is the lobbying group for venture-capital firms, published a study concluding that the tax change would harm investment funds run by women and minorities. That would \"risk a reversal in the gains that are being made toward increasing diversity among the investor community,\" said the study.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think U.S. corporations pay too much or too little in taxes? Join the conversation below.</p><p>It identified Arizona as one of 10 states that would be hurt the most from the tax change. Lobbyists shared their findings with Ms. Sinema.</p><p>The chief tax writer in the House, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), had been advancing the House's version of Mr. Biden's bill that included the $14 billion tax increase affecting private equity.</p><p>Mr. Neal moved the bill through the Ways and Means Committee and prepared for a vote by the full House.</p><p>A few weeks ago House Democratic leaders dropped the private-equity tax measure from Mr. Biden's bill.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office agreed not to include any tax increases in the final version of the House bill that didn't have the support of all Democratic senators.</p><p>When the new private-equity tax was raised with Ms. Sinema, she objected.</p><p>Write to Brody Mullins at brody.mullins@wsj.com and Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com</p><p>The Surprise Winners From Biden's $2 Trillion Spending Bill: Wall Street and Tobacco Companies</p>",
