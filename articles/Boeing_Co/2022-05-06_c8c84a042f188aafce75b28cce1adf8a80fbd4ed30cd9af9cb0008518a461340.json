  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics today shows the US added 428,000 jobs in April, matching the revised figure in March. The unemployment rate was steady at 3.6 per cent, similar to the level in February 2020 before the first coronavirus wave hit the country.</p> <p>However, the persistence of a tight labour market and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f068499-ce61-4626-88a9-de3b38a74dcf\">high inflation pose concerns</a> for the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve. This week, the US central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points for the first time since 2000 — to a target range of between 0.75 and 1 per cent — to curb rising prices. Inflation in the US is currently running at a 40-year high.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5766cdb7-7399-4552-9884-d3fd3339fb0d\">US stocks fell on Friday</a>, extending sharp losses from the previous session, as signs of a tightening jobs market compounded inflation worries. European shares also declined, with the regional Stoxx 600 index losing almost 2 per cent, putting it on track to end the week more than 4 per cent down. London's FTSE 100 lost 1.3 per cent and Germany's Xetra Dax also fell 1.3 per cent.</p> <p>The Nasdaq Composite, comprised of many of the largest US technology companies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ba254c-74e3-4e33-903d-98813264ed4c\">closed down 5 per cent</a> yesterday, in its biggest one-day decline since 2020. The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index also declined on Thursday with a 3.5 per cent loss.</p> <p>As the world continues to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine is exacerbating inflationary problems. Central banks are faced with the risk that controlling rising prices could lead to economic decline.</p> <p>The Bank of England warned yesterday that the UK economy was heading towards a recession and inflation would hit 10 per cent this year, as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5001ffb8-96d6-4e1a-a9dc-5ad4470930c7\">lifted the interest rate to 1 per cent</a>, the country's highest level since 2009.</p> <p>With UK prices likely to rise at their fastest rate in more than 40 years as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f147a22e-0ce4-4659-b463-3fa1828e264a\">sustained double-digit inflation</a> becomes possible for the first time since the 1970s, the BoE — which is celebrating 25 years of independence this week — faces challenges that it has not encountered in the past quarter of a century, writes economics editor Chris Giles.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Ukraine urges Médecins Sans Frontières to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d13be0-9efd-4577-bf71-c71ce3e14c20#post-93cb3f3c-ee36-4858-83dd-6b99bf53ce74\">evacuate wounded from Azovstal steel plant</a></p></li>  <li><p>Glass Lewis advises Amazon shareholders to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d13be0-9efd-4577-bf71-c71ce3e14c20#post-bdef9a7d-f7fb-4745-a978-89b6d3bf7054\">vote against pay policy</a></p></li>  <li><p>German industry suffers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d13be0-9efd-4577-bf71-c71ce3e14c20#post-8388f4b3-4ccb-49b2-abbb-c4447a5cb56f\">biggest drop in output</a> since start of pandemic</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d13be0-9efd-4577-bf71-c71ce3e14c20\"><em>visit our&#xa0;live blog</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>China's president <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> has reaffirmed his commitment to the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d762b8-a9d3-4208-adec-9e57c0fb75d2\">controversial zero-Covid strategy</a>, warning against “any slackening” in the effort and vowing to crack down on criticism of the policy despite signs of damage to the economy.</p> <p><strong>US homebuyers</strong> are stretching their budgets to buy new homes and rushing to strike deals to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ce4a288-c829-4a44-8522-c92961f1bb8a\">avoid higher mortgage financing costs</a>, according to the latest industry data.

Operating profit tumbled 38 per cent to €437mn in the first quarter as the company was hit by the economic fallout from China's strict Covid policies.</p> <p>Australia's biggest investment bank <strong>Macquarie Group</strong> profited from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/052d64b3-6c6c-4ce0-be80-b5b539e4e454\">volatility on global commodity markets</a> and record dealmaking, driving full-year net profit up 56 per cent from the previous year to a record high of A$4.7bn ($3.3bn).</p> <p><strong>British Airways</strong> has been forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3e3757c-90a0-4c39-ab21-0526a584be22\">cut flight schedules further</a> as it struggles to hire staff quickly enough to meet renewed demand for travel after culling nearly 10,000 jobs during the pandemic, raising concerns that the carrier could miss out on a bumper summer for European airlines.</p> <p>France has warmly welcomed <strong>Binance's</strong> bid to put down roots in one of Europe's top financial centres, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/141408bb-3833-43c5-853b-a68d4fdaa330\">drawing a deep divide</a> with watchdogs in the UK that rejected the crypto giant. Binance this week received a nod from French financial regulators, a move that clears the way for the crypto exchange to establish a significant presence in the G7 nation that could also help the company unlock access to other jurisdictions across Europe.</p> <p><strong>Boeing</strong> will move its headquarters to the Washington, DC area from Chicago, bringing the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8230637e-7bab-4b71-9e7b-3870fdc31885\">closer to federal lawmakers and rival defence contractors</a>. The move comes during a tumultuous period for the company, which has been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jet in 2018 and 2019 as well as the discovery of flaws in its 787 Dreamliner.</p> <h1>Science round-up</h1> <p>The true total global pandemic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb593801-eec5-4496-a647-e00ccbc3e336\">death toll was about 15mn</a> by the end of 2021, based on an analysis of excess mortality, said the <strong>World Health Organization</strong>. Ten countries, including India, the US and Russia, accounted for about two-thirds of the total excess deaths in a two-year period.</p> <p>“We have found that the global death toll is higher for men than for women”, splitting 57 per cent to 43 per cent, said Dr William Msemburi, an official in the WHO's department of data and analytics. The excess deaths were also concentrated in older people, with 82 per cent of deaths estimated to have occurred in the over-60s. The data highlights the need for better health systems and continued development of treatments and vaccines.</p> <p>US drugmaker <strong>Moderna</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48bf4ba7-c112-476f-a671-586cf5729f58\">developing an Omicron jab</a> to be released in the autumn, aiming for those in the northern hemisphere to get boosted in October.
