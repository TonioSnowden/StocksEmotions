  "text": "<p>Mr. Isaacman could be heard saying shortly after touchdown that it was a \"heck of a ride\" and that things were \"just getting started.\" Boats moved toward the capsule following the landing, according to the live stream.</p><p>In a tweet Saturday evening, Mr. Musk congratulated the mission.</p><p>The Inspiration4 mission broke ground for a private human space flight, marking the first occasion that a crew of people who weren't government astronauts traveled to orbit on a company's spaceship. Previous tourists who traveled that deep into space had to purchase seats on Russian government rockets.</p><p>Related Feature</p><p>* SpaceX and the Civilian Travel Era: How Elon Musk Created Inspiration4</p><p>The mission marked other firsts as well. Ms. Arceneaux, who is 29, was the youngest American and woman to travel to space, according to a spokesman. Dr. Proctor, designated as the pilot for the trip, was the first Black woman to serve in that role.</p><p>SpaceX took the crew to the deepest orbit that Americans have been to since 2009, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration last repaired the Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p>Mr. Musk's company launched the crew toward orbit Wednesday evening. The mission used a space vehicle SpaceX has also tapped to take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station: a Crew Dragon capsule stacked on top of one of its Falcon 9 rockets.</p><p>During their trip to orbit with SpaceX, crew members held video calls with children at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the recipient of its charitable funds; conducted scientific experiments; and floated around while taking in views of Earth. On Friday, they appeared on video at the New York Stock Exchange at the close of trading. Meals on board included pasta Bolognese, lamb and cold pizza.</p><p>\"Sorry it was cold! Dragon will have a food warmer &amp; free wifi next time,\" Mr. Musk said in a tweet about the latter item.</p><p>Private space trips are one part of a commercial space industry that also includes rocket-launch startups and venture-backed companies focused on refueling satellites, as well as larger aerospace companies with decades of experience building space vehicles for government clients.</p><p>SpaceX isn't alone in seeing opportunity in tourist visits to space. This summer, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., founded by Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC completed high-profile trips to the edge of space with their founders on board. Boeing Co. has said seats on future missions on its Starliner capsule, which has yet to carry people to space, could be bought by tourists.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's next for commercial space exploration? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Executives have said SpaceX has a backlog of commercial trips booked and that it wants to conduct at least six such missions a year.</p><p>It might take years before more people are able to access space, because of the costs of such trips and relatively limited capacity. Virgin Galactic said in August it would charge consumers at least $450,000 a seat for its flights, while Blue Origin sold for about $30 million a seat on its rocket that took Mr. Bezos to space.</p><p>Space tourism might generate close to $4 billion in annual revenue by 2030, according to an estimate from UBS. Access to space will broaden when the equivalent of plane loads of people are able to travel there, said Myles Walton, a UBS analyst.</p><p>Mr. Isaacman, the chief executive of Shift4 Payments Inc. who paid for Inspiration4, hasn't said how much he paid for the trip but has said it was less than the amount the mission aims to raise for charity, which is $200 million.</p><p>The mission is a \"very, very small steppingstone in the bigger dream of making space accessible to everyone,\" Mr. Isaacman said in an interview before the takeoff.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>SpaceX Returns Private Astronauts to Earth After Three Days in Orbit</p>",
