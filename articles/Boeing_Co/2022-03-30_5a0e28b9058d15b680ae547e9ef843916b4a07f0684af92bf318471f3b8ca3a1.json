  "text": "<p>   Crash investigators from the U.S. are hoping to travel within a matter of days to China to help with the investigation into the crash of a China Eastern Airlines Corp. plane that killed all 132 people on board. </p><p>   Chinese authorities issued visas for investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, along with technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration, and Boeing Co., the NTSB said Tuesday. </p><p>   While China is leading the investigation, under international-aviation rules, U.S. representatives are allowed to participate in part because the plane involved in the crash -- a Boeing 737-800 -- was made in the U.S. </p><p>   The safety board said it hoped the U.S. team will leave this week. The NTSB has already appointed a senior official to lead its team and has been in touch with the Chinese investigator-in-charge, a spokesman said earlier. </p><p>   The crash on March 21 of the China Eastern plane caused it to disintegrate when it nosedived into a mountain in southern China, scattering debris across a wide area of heavily wooded and rugged terrain. </p><p>   On Sunday, a team of firefighters found the aircraft's flight-data recorder buried several feet underground roughly 130 feet from where the plane crashed in southern China's Guangxi autonomous region, officials said. </p><p>   That device, along with a cockpit-voice recorder that search teams found last week, should help investigators determine why the aircraft crashed, flight-safety experts have said. </p><p>   Flight-data recorders track details about flights, including airspeed and the position of the wing flaps. Cockpit-voice recorders typically keep a rolling two-hour record of the sounds in the cockpit. </p><p>   In addition to the recorders, investigators have said more than 33,000 pieces of debris from the crash have been found. </p><p>   Overseas travelers entering China are required to quarantine themselves for at least two weeks, with many cities adopting an additional period of a week or longer of isolation at home or government facilities. </p><p>   Investigators in China have said all 132 people on board the plane died, making it the country's worst air disaster since 1994. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Yoko Kubota contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
