  "title": "Lawmakers Boost Military, Domestic Spending in $1.65 Trillion Omnibus Bill; Package, which includes $44.9 billion for Ukraine and NATO allies, must be passed by Congress this week",
  "text": "<p>The bill, the product of months of behind-the-scenes haggling, also carries an additional $44.9 billion in aid to help Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, $40.6 billion for disasters such as drought and hurricanes, as well as funds earmarked for projects in lawmakers' home districts. It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices, and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane.</p><p>The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion from the prior year. The overall discretionary price tag works out to about $1.65 trillion, compared with $1.5 trillion the prior fiscal year.</p><p>Congress must pass the spending package through both chambers before the expiration of an interim funding bill that runs through Dec. 23. Because of the delays built into the Senate's process, quick enactment will depend on whether all 100 senators can agree to forgo debate time and proceed to a final vote. The Senate is expected to vote first, followed by the House, where leaders have told lawmakers to expect a vote late Wednesday at the earliest.</p><p>The bill will require support of at least 10 Republicans in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation to advance. Many House Republicans have urged their Senate colleagues to reject the package and push talks into next year, when the GOP will control the House. But Republican senators have largely coalesced behind the plan.</p><p>The Biden administration said it supports the legislation.</p><p>\"Our bipartisan, bicameral, omnibus appropriations bill directly invests in providing relief from the burden of inflation on the American people,\" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D., Vt.). \"The choice is clear: We can either do our jobs and fund the government, or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path forward.\"</p><p>Senate Republicans said that the increases in military spending represented GOP victories, claiming that the deal broke a yearslong bargain to ensure parity between increases in defense and nondefense spending. That is because inflation as measured by the consumer-price index is up 7.1% from a year earlier, and while the defense-spending increase exceeded that level, the nondefense discretionary spending increase fell short of the inflation rate.</p><p>\"Since day one, I have insisted on increasing defense funding well above the president's request without similar increases in wasteful liberal nondefense spending,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"This process was far from perfect, but ultimately it allowed Republican redlines to be adhered to and because of that I will urge my colleagues to support this package.\"</p><p>The bill incorporates the Senate's version of the Electoral Count Reform Act, bipartisan legislation that overhauls an 1887 law governing how Congress counts and ratifies presidential elector votes. The bill was written in response to efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to try to overturn the 2020 election results. It would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial only, and that the vice president's role is limited to counting the votes publicly.</p><p>It would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors from one House member and one senator to one-fifth of both chambers, and establish a fast-tracked judicial review of disputes related to states' elector certificates, including a three-judge panel with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Left out of the package were several initiatives pushed by lawmakers outside the spending negotiations. The bill didn't expand the child tax credit for low-income families, as some Democrats wanted, or reinstate the immediate deduction of research costs incurred by businesses, as some Republicans and companies sought.</p><p>A provision that would have offered green cards to evacuated Afghans in the U.S., known as the Afghan Adjustment Act, wasn't included. But lawmakers did include an extension of the special immigrant visa program for Afghans who worked alongside the American military through 2024.</p><p>The spending package kept annual funding for the Internal Revenue Service essentially flat, removing annual funding for technology improvements and forcing the agency to cover higher salaries and other inflationary increases within the same nominal dollar amount in its main divisions.</p><p>Republicans had sought cuts to the IRS budget, complaining that Democrats already made the tax agency flush after approving $80 billion in the climate, healthcare and tax legislation that Mr. Biden signed in August. The less the IRS gets each year, the more that $80 billion will be used to backfill routine costs instead of IRS expansion.</p><p>Democrats highlighted the inclusion of $5 billion in mandatory funding for a toxic-exposures fund to cover healthcare for about two-dozen health conditions that the Department of Veterans Affairs now considers automatically related to military service, including diseases related to exposure to burn pits in combat zones. That was well above the $1.4 billion that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would be needed this year.</p><p>The bill also would ban the downloading of TikTok on government-issued smartphones and other devices, expanding to all government devices a ban currently imposed by the Pentagon and some other U.S. agencies. A separate bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent earlier this month but had not been brought up in the House. The legislation comes amid widening concerns over the Chinese-owned video app's security risks for the U.S.</p><p>One provision in the 4,155-page legislation gives Boeing more time to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane without significant cockpit overhauls. The Dec. 27 deadline had been set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without an extension, Boeing said in a securities filing that it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. Orders for the planes are valued at tens of billions of dollars in revenue. Boeing declined to comment.</p><p>House Republican leaders have urged their rank-and-file members to oppose the package arguing that negotiations should be pushed into next year, when GOP control of the chamber will give it more leverage. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is leading the opposition as he seeks to cajole members to support his bid to be elected House speaker next year.</p><p>But because a majority of Democrats can pass the bill without Republican support, much of the focus is on the Senate. Top Senate Republicans are calling for passage, saying that they limited nondefense spending on domestic programs through their negotiations. The main question is whether Senate Republicans opposed to the bill will exercise their power to slow down the voting beyond Dec. 23, the last day of government funding.</p><p>\"I object to a budget that nobody will see to the very end, thousands of pages long, created by a few people basically in secret,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) told reporters on Monday night, referring to the closed-door negotiations over the spending bill. \"I see no value to this process. We're ruining the country.\"</p><p>Eliza Collins, Michelle Hackman, Katy Stech Ferek, Richard Rubin and John D.
