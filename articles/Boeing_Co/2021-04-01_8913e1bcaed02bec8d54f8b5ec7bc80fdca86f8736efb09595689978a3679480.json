  "text": "<p>\n  RUSSIA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Imprisoned Navalny </p><p>\n  Begins Hunger Strike </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has begun a hunger strike to protest a lack of treatment for what he describes as a debilitating health issue he has suffered since being imprisoned in February, the latest standoff between Russian authorities and the protest leader. </p><p>\n  The opposition politician's announcement comes as his followers are working to rally support for new protests after street demonstrations earlier this year were called off in the face of police violence and the detention of thousands countrywide. </p><p>\n  Mr. Navalny, who is over 6 feet tall, said he suffered a pinched nerve because of cramped conditions in police wagons, jail cells and the cages reserved for defendants in criminal cases in Russia. The country's main prison facilities authority said his health is stable and satisfactory and that he has received all necessary medical assistance. Mr. Navalny says he has been offered ibuprofen to relieve the pain. </p><p>\n  -- Thomas Grove </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CHINA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Consumers Boost </p><p>\n  Economic Recovery </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  China's economic recovery picked up a surprising amount of steam in March, boosted by strong domestic consumption and unquenchable foreign demand for Chinese-made goods. </p><p>\n  The country's official manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of factory activity, hit a three-month high of 51.9 in March, topping February's reading of 50.6 with the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. </p><p>\n  More encouraging for China's leaders -- who have been eager to rebalance the economy toward consumer spending after a year in which manufacturing drove the recovery -- a parallel gauge of services and the construction industry jumped even more in March, suggesting a broadening of consumer activity. </p><p>\n  The official nonmanufacturing PMI surged to 56.3 from February's 51.4 reading, the statistics bureau said Wednesday. </p><p>\n  -- Jonathan Cheng </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  INDONESIA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Recorder Is Found in </p><p>\n  Sriwijaya Air Crash </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Indonesian navy divers recovered the cockpit voice recorder of a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in January, killing all 62 people on board, officials said Wednesday. </p><p>\n  Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said divers retrieved the cockpit recorder Tuesday night, near where the flight data recorder was recovered three days after the accident. </p><p>\n  The device could help investigators determine what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the ocean in heavy rain shortly after it took off from Jakarta on Jan. 9. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NIGER </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Attempted Coup </p><p>\n  By Military Thwarted </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Niger's security forces thwarted an attempted military coup at the West African country's presidential palace overnight just two days before the newly elected president is to be sworn in to office in a peaceful transfer of power, the government said. </p><p>\n  The coup attempt raises fear of more violence coinciding with newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum's inauguration on Friday. Already his administration faces unprecedented threats from Islamic extremists near its troubled border with Mali. </p><p>\n  Several people have been arrested in connection with the coup attempt while others linked to the events are being sought, a government spokesman said. </p><p>\n  The overnight crackle of gunfire in the neighborhood near the palace immediately prompted concerns of a coup attempt given that Niger has a long history of the military seizing power by force since its independence from France in 1960. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
