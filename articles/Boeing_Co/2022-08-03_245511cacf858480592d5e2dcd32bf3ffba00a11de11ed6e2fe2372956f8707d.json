The new three-year contract offers new workers an $8,000 lump-sum payment and scraps earlier plans to cut company contributions to employees' 401(k) savings plans.</p><p>Boeing said it welcomed the outcome of the vote.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com </p><p>Boeing's St. Louis-Area Workers Accept New Contract, Drop Strike Plan</p>",
