  "text": "<p>JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.â€”NASA plans to take another shot at launching its massive rocket on Saturday after pulling the plug on an attempt earlier in the week because of technical challenges.</p><p>Weather conditions are expected to be 60% favorable for blastoff, as a two-hour flight window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET, officials said Friday. The launch director for the mission Saturday morning gave teams handling the effort the green light to fuel up and attempt the flight.</p><p>After years of delays and cost overruns, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is poised Saturday to try to ignite the Space Launch System rocket and launch the crewless Artemis I mission from a pad at the Kennedy site. Artemis is the name of NASA's program to return astronauts to the moon, where no person has visited since 1972, and eventually to develop a long-term presence there and push on to Mars.</p><p>For Artemis I, the SLS rocket would power the uncrewed Orion spacecraft toward a lunar orbit. Later, the capsule on that vehicle would return to Earth as part of a critical test of its heat shield.</p><p>NASA scrubbed Monday's attempt after encountering a series of challenges during countdown. In particular, the agency decided it needed more time to analyze data related to a problem that emerged during a cooling procedure for the SLS rocket's four engines.</p><p>While auto-racing drivers warm up engines on their cars before competing, NASA needs to chill the engines on the SLS rocket to around minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit to condition them for takeoff. During the attempt on Monday, one of the four engines wasn't getting as cold as the other three, though none of them cooled down to the right temperatures, officials said during briefings this week.</p><p>NASA officials said on Thursday that a temperature sensor delivered faulty data about the engine in question, even though sufficient quantities of ultracold liquid hydrogen used for the cool-down procedure were flowing into the engines.</p><p>\"We know we had a bad sensor. That was our challenge,\" said John Honeycutt, the agency's manager for the SLS program.</p><p>Photos: NASA's Artemis I Moon Launch</p><p>During the countdown on Saturday, teams planned to start the engine-cooling effort around 8 a.m. in order to help them verify the engines were in shape for a potential liftoff, officials said.</p><p>However, NASA missed that start time Saturday as it dealt with a hydrogen leak that emerged during fueling, said Derrol Nail, the agency's commentator on its livestream. The SLS rocket uses super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants and filling its enormous tanks with them is a challenge. The liquid-hydrogen tank was less than 10% full as of 8:45 a.m. ET.</p><p>Blastoff on Saturday would start a roughly 37-day mission if all goes well, with the Orion capsule returning to splash down in the Pacific Ocean around Oct. 11. If the mission is delayed Saturday, NASA could try again to launch Monday or Tuesday. After that, the agency would need to roll the vehicle back to a storage building at Kennedy and wouldn't be able to attempt a launch until Sept. 19.</p><p>Postponing flights wasn't uncommon during previous agency launch campaigns over the years, such as when NASA operated the space shuttle, which last flew in 2011. Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator and a former astronaut, said a shuttle flight he was on was pushed off four times before it flew. He has said NASA won't try to loft the SLS rocket for the Artemis I mission until it is ready.</p><p>After the first Artemis mission, NASA plans one more test flight using SLS and Orion before it looks to use the vehicles to set up the first moon landing in decades. That is a relatively small number of missions, according to some former leaders at the space agency.</p><p>\"NASA's testing cadence is not what any engineer would prefer to have,\" said Michael Griffin, a former NASA administrator. \"The reason is if NASA has a major failure, unlike the case for commercial operators, NASA will be subject to intense criticism, congressional investigations and the likely firing of the administrator. Few people are willing to risk that.\"</p><p>For the second Artemis mission, slated for 2024, NASA plans to launch astronauts on board Orion into lunar orbit using a SLS rocket, but they wouldn't try to touch down.</p><p>One year after that, the agency would use another SLS rocket and Orion ship to take astronauts back to orbiting the moon, where they would board a SpaceX Starship lander that the Elon Musk-led company is developing to take two astronauts to the lunar surface.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think is the future of lunar exploration? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The different elements of the SLS rockets are jettisoned after use, though an increasing number of components and systems on Orion will be reused as Artemis missions take place, according to Lockheed Martin Corp., the ship's main developer.</p><p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for SpaceX, is developing its Starship spacecraft, and the booster that would blast it off, to be fully reusable. SpaceX's rocket system hasn't flown an orbital test yet.</p><p>NASA relied on Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and other aerospace companies to develop different parts of the SLS rocket. The agency and main contractors have said they are pushing to reduce costs and streamline operations for Artemis. The first four Artemis flights are expected to cost $4.1 billion each, NASA's inspector general has said.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>NASA Tries Again to Launch Artemis I Moon Mission</p>",
