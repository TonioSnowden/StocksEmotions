  "text": "<p>Richard Branson's first cruise ship will finally set sail this week after three false starts, a 17-month delay and “a significant amount of money” poured into the business by investors.</p> <p>Scarlet Lady will depart with just over a third of its full capacity on three and four-night cruises from Portsmouth in the UK. It was originally intended to launch from Miami last April for itineraries to the Virgin's private resort in the Bahamas, but the company's plans were brought to an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ff5129-6817-4a19-af02-1316f8defe52\">abrupt standstill </a>by the pandemic.</p> <p>As part of the Virgin Group founder's strategy to shake up the cruise industry and attract a younger audience, the €600m Scarlet Lady features immersive theatre, a tattoo parlour and a “sexologist” on its adult-only trips.</p> <p>A second ship, Valiant Lady, which was scheduled to launch last May, will start sailing out of Barcelona from next spring.</p> <p>“It's a great time to launch because if you think about it, there is incredible pent-up demand. The number one thing people miss is a vacation,” said Tom McAlpin, Virgin Voyages' chief executive.</p> <p>As with the majority of the cruise industry, which agreed a voluntary pause in operations in the early months of the crisis after several deadly outbreaks of coronavirus on ships, Virgin was forced to make “tough decisions”, he added.</p> <p>All of the group's 2,000 employees were either put on furlough or went down to four-day weeks and took a month's unpaid leave. Senior executives had their pay cut by a fifth. Around 85 per cent of the Scarlet Lady's crew have returned to work with the brand but the remainder were laid off.</p> <p>Virgin's majority shareholder, the US private equity firm Bain Capital, as well as Branson's Virgin Group and four other investors, had to inject “a significant amount of money” into the business, McAlpin said. The sum was not disclosed.</p> <p>Boston-based Bain also bailed out Branson's Virgin Australia airline in November in a $3.5bn deal, according to PitchBook data, and through its credit arm has financed new Boeing aircraft for Virgin Atlantic.</p> <p>According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, who run a regular survey of travel agents in the US, the cruise sector's largest market, bookings have recovered in recent months and prices “are holding up well”.</p> <p>But, the analysts warned, resumption of cruising was slow given the continuing changes to health protocols from different government authorities and the industry could face oversupply as new orders outstripped the number of ships being sent for scrap.</p> <p>They expected that around 60 per cent of the 270-strong global cruise fleet would be sailing by the end of this year.</p> <p>McAlpin said he estimated that all of the industry's ships would be sailing again by the end of 2022. Virgin plans to launch two further ships from its $160m home port in Miami before the end of 2023 and employ another 6,000 to 7,000 staff in the next three years.</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock 2021 'Virgin cruise ship set for debut after investors keep it afloat' FT.com 1 August.
