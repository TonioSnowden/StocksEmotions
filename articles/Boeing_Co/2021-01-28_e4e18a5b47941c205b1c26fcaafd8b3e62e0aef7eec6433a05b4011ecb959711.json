  "title": "Boeing's Biggest Loss Reflects Pandemic Toll",
  "text": "<p>The delay leaves Boeing even more reliant on its defense business and other troubled commercial-aircraft programs to reverse heavy losses, as the pandemic has sapped demand for new planes. Executives said Wednesday they didn't expect Boeing would stop bleeding cash until next year.</p><p>\"2020 was a year like no other,\" Chief Executive David Calhoun said on an investor call. \"Our world, our industry, our business and our communities were facing unprecedented challenges -- and we're still in the midst of it.\"</p><p>Mr. Calhoun, who took over as CEO a year ago, began his tenure facing the MAX crisis, then the largest in Boeing's history. As the company struggled to restore public confidence, the pandemic quickly became another all-consuming crisis that has forced Mr. Calhoun to slash production and cut tens of thousands of jobs.</p><p>Now he is managing a smaller company trying to overcome its past missteps while keeping up with fierce competition from its European rival Airbus SE. Boeing scrapped plans last year for a new jet, and Mr. Calhoun said Wednesday the company was in no rush to launch a fresh aircraft.</p><p>With production of the 747 jumbo ending next year, the 777X will become Boeing's biggest plane when it enters service as soon as late 2023.</p><p>Government travel restrictions have made it tougher for airlines to fill big planes. Boeing has just 309 orders for the 777X, most from Middle East carriers such as Emirates Airline that bought them at the height of the industry's boom several years ago. No U.S. airlines have ordered the plane.</p><p>Boeing said the 777X, which seats up to about 400 passengers, has also been held back by heightened regulatory scrutiny. This follows lapses certifying the 737 MAX. The company lost almost $12 billion last year as total jetliner deliveries more than halved, with airlines taking thousands of planes out of service and canceling orders for hundreds more.</p><p>Boeing has been plagued by a series of botched jetliner and military programs that more than halved its market value over the past two years. That was even before the pandemic halted a decadelong boom in aircraft sales, prompting the company's plans to shed 31,000 jobs by the end of 2021.</p><p>The $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X reflects lower expected profits over the life of the wide-body plane.</p><p>The plane maker's shares fell nearly 4% on Wednesday.</p><p>Boeing's fourth-quarter loss of $8.44 billion pushed its annual deficit to $11.94 billion. Revenue for the year slipped 24% to $58.2 billion, leaving the industry bellwether as the fourth-largest aerospace and defense company world-wide by sales after Raytheon Technologies Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Airbus.</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing expects jetliner revenue to increase this year as airlines take more 737 MAX jets, with 787 deliveries resuming by March from a backlog of about 80 that underwent inspections.</p><p>Global regulators had grounded the MAX for nearly two years after two crashes killed 346 people, but the U.S. approved it for passenger flights again in November. European regulators approved on Wednesday the aircraft to resume commercial flights, and Boeing expects it to be cleared to fly in all markets by midyear. Boeing restarted MAX deliveries in December from a backlog of 450 finished planes.</p><p>The company burned through $18.4 billion in cash last year. Boeing has said it doesn't expect to be cash-flow positive until next year. It still has orders for more than 4,000 planes, but its backlog of deals shrank by a quarter to $282 billion. Boeing reported a per share loss of $14.65 for the latest quarter, far worse than analysts expected because of the 777X charge. It included a previously announced $744 million charge as part of a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department related to the MAX.</p><p>---</p><p>Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.</p>",
