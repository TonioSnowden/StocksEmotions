  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Qatar Airways Calls Airbus  Too Close With Regulator  ----  By Benjamin Katz",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Qatar Airways Ltd. accused Airbus SE of being too close to its safety regulator in a multibillion-dollar legal dispute over paint chipping on the body and wings of one of its flagship aircraft. </p><p>   The airline made the accusation Friday in a statement to a London court as part of a case in which it claims that surface-paint issues on its fleet of A350s present a safety risk. Qatar Airways has grounded 29 aircraft over the issue, reducing its capacity as it prepares for a surge in travel to Doha for soccer's 2022 FIFA World Cup, which starts this month. </p><p>   Qatar Airways is suing Airbus for damages partly based on the impact on its operations from not being able to use the aircraft. Airbus on Friday said the tally had reached approximately $2 billion and was \"continuing to increase on a daily basis.\" </p><p>   At the heart of the dispute is peeling and cracking paint on some of its A350s. Qatar Airways says this exposes the copper mesh underneath that is designed to protect the planes from lightning strikes. Airbus has acknowledged the degradation but says the issue is only cosmetic and not a risk to safety -- a position its regulator, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, has agreed with in its own independent assessments. </p><p>   In written statements to London's High Court on Friday, ahead of a trial scheduled to start in June, Qatar Airways said \"Airbus was able to exert influence over EASA at the highest level\" in regards to the paint issue. </p><p>   The airline gave examples of several instances that it said undermined the independence of the regulator, which -- similar to the Federal Aviation Administration's relationship with Boeing Co. -- oversees the certification and airworthiness of all Airbus aircraft. </p><p>   Qatar Airways said that documents disclosed by Airbus in the court hearings showed that the plane maker had helped EASA by providing it with a \"line to take\" when communicating on the paint issue to other airline customers. </p><p>   EASA said the agency had coordinated with Airbus on communications \"to a limited extent only to ensure technical accuracy.\" </p><p>   Qatar Airways also accused EASA of failing to independently verify information provided by Airbus, of not following up on a safety concern it had raised with the plane maker and having two employees involved in the assessment of the A350's airworthiness who were previously two longtime Airbus employees. </p><p>   EASA said Airbus had never refused to provide technical information relevant to the regulator's safety assessments. </p><p>   In its court submission Friday, Airbus said that Qatar Airways' allegations were \"based entirely on unsubstantiated speculation and innuendo about Airbus' relationship with EASA.\" </p><p>   An Airbus spokesman added that the company had followed \"all relevant procedures which includes the involvement of the EASA which is entirely normal and proper as the governing civil aviation authority.\" </p><p>   Airbus has argued against Qatar Airways' claims that the paint issue is safety related, which is core to the  dispute. The plane maker has also challenged the decision by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority to instruct the grounding of the affected aircraft. </p><p>   The QCAA didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p></p>",
