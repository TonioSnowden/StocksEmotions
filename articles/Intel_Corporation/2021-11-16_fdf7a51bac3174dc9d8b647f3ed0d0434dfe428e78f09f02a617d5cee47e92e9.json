  "title": "Strap Yourself In: Inflation Isn't Going Away; An aging workforce and trade in retreat—such price pressures won't soon disappear.",
  "text": "<p>Wages also increased at their fastest pace in decades, but not enough to compensate for rising prices, reducing real wages by 1.1%. Not surprisingly, Americans' expectations for inflation over the next year hit a record 5.7% in October.</p><p>As recently as the end of August, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was still arguing that the rise in inflation affected a \"relatively narrow group of goods and services,\" a stance he has since abandoned. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, senior administration economists and Mr. Powell continue to insist that the current inflation spike will be \"transitory.\" The date things will return to normal keeps getting pushed back.</p><p>Mr. Powell and others may be right, but the evidence against their position is accumulating. Most U.S. firms are reporting limited consumer resistance to price hikes. Households have built up more than $2 trillion in saving thanks to government transfers and less spending during the pandemic. For upper-income households, the \"wealth effect\" is boosting their demand for goods and services.</p><p>Economists old enough to remember the 1970s point out that the decade's wage-price spiral was spurred by automatic cost-of-living wage increases, which have all but disappeared. They may be making a comeback. John Deere's latest offer to its striking workers includes an automatic cost-of-living adjustment, and other companies could follow suit to compete for workers.</p><p>Two of the factors most often blamed for disruptions that lead to price hikes—shortages of computer chips and the snarled supply chain—won't abate as quickly as policy makers hope. The chairman of Intel has predicted that global demand for chips will exceed supply well into 2023. In the interim, auto makers will continue to compete with the electronics industry for scarce supplies. Many auto companies are responding by cutting back on lower-cost, lower-margin models in favor of more-expensive ones—not a winning formula for reducing inflation.</p><p>Problems with the supply chain run deeper. Even if the Biden administration succeeds in getting the nation's ports to operate around the clock, other choke points, such as overwhelmed railroads and the shortage of warehouse space, will continue to slow the delivery of goods. Worse, a wave of retirements and resignations has produced a shortage of about 80,000 truck drivers.</p><p>Most fundamentally, the forces that produced four decades of declining interest rates and low inflation have halted. The U.S. labor force, which grew by 1.6% annually in the 1980s and 1.3% in the 1990s, is projected to grow by only 0.5% a year in the current decade. Politics continues to stymie the immigration reforms needed to plug the gap.</p><p>With an aging population at home and throughout the industrialized world—including in China—slow labor-force growth will exert persistent upward pressure on wages. As the elderly spend a portion of their savings and transfer the remainder to their children and grandchildren, consumer demand will increase. Absent faster increases in productivity, more inflation than we've seen during the past 40 years is likely.</p><p>Open trade and global supply chains are on the decline. Intensifying competition between the U.S. and China and the populist revolt against economic liberalization help explain this shift. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of globalized systems. Business leaders will give more weight to resilience, at some cost to efficiency. To reduce risk, some production will move to the U.S. or friendly countries closer to home, adding to upward pressures on labor and other costs.</p><p>In the very long term, the fight to slow climate change could reduce energy costs, but this seems unlikely during the next two decades. Although coal has enormous negative effects on the environment, it is comparatively cheap, and the shift toward electric vehicles won't happen fast enough to reduce demand for gasoline any time soon.</p><p>In considering the next steps, the Biden administration and the Fed should give much more weight to the evidence that emerging inflationary pressures are structural—not temporary.</p><p>Strap Yourself In: Inflation Isn't Going Away</p>",
