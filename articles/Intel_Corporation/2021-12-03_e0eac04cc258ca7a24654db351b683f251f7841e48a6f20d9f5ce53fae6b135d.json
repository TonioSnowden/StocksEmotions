  "title": "Adobe stock stumbles toward worst day in 20 months as DocuSign fears spark ‘knee-jerk reaction'",
  "text": "<p>DocuSign DOCU Chief Executive Dan Springer acknowledged Thursday that while his electronic-signature company saw “accelerated growth” for six quarters amid the pandemic, customers have gone back to “more normalized buying patterns.” As a result, DocuSign delivered a downbeat bookings outlook, sending its shares cratering 40%.</p><p>Some of that investor fear seems to be transferring over to Adobe ADBE, which also offers contract-management software and allows for the collection of e-signatures. Adobe's stock is off 9.4% in Friday afternoon trading and on pace to log its steepest single-day percentage drop since March 16, 2020, when it lost 14.8%. Adobe is pacing S&amp;P 500 SPX laggards Friday.</p><p>The decline in Adobe shares struck Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives as a “DOCU-related selloff” as DocuSign's report served as a “a barometer that the WFH tailwinds are now abating and could be a headwind for Adobe,” he told MarketWatch. “The DOCU print was a shocker and this is a knee-jerk reaction.”</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?

The company highlighted its e-signature technology in its prior earnings report, as Chief Financial Officer John Murphy noted that “third-quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included adoption of Sign in Acrobat driven by the increased need to collaborate in a hybrid work environment.”</p><p>While other at-home stocks took a hit on disappointing outlooks earlier in the course of the pandemic, DocuSign initially appeared more resilient. Its stock hit an all-time high in September and was up 165% since March 2020 as of Thursday's close. Now the company will need to “show that it can generate, not just fulfill, demand on a regular basis,” according to an Evercore analyst.</p><p>FactSet, MarketWatchAdobe has a more diversified business than DocuSign. While the company sells contract-related software, it has a variety of other offerings including subscriptions to creative programs like Photoshop. Adobe's Document Cloud accounted for about 13% of the company's overall revenue in its last-reported quarter.</p><p>Shares of Adobe were up 86% since March 2020 as of Thursday's close.</p>",
