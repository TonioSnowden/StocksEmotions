  "text": "<p>So then, goodbye. Whatever else unfolds in <em>No Time To Die</em>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22a0f9b4-9864-4322-8328-5b78bfecd892\">much-delayed</a> new James Bond film, we go in knowing it will be the last to star Daniel Craig. An elegiac mood hangs over the movie — one much concerned with legacies, evolutions, parents, children, the ends of eras. </p> <p>It also cuts another way —&#xa0;the film often has the berserker energy of an office leaving party turned all-nighter. Is no one safe? Barely have the lights gone down before we are forced to think the unthinkable, a <em>ka-boom</em> when we least expect it almost bringing an end to Bond altogether. It is not the last surprise package.</p> <p>Of course, the film has had more to deal with yet than the exit of its leading man. “No Time To Die”, the single by Billie Eilish, was released on February 13 2020, the day after London's first case of what had just been designated as Covid-19. Only now does her shivery torch song actually get to accompany the opening titles. </p> <p>Nineteen months is a long time for a martini to sit unserved. The worry would be a film that now tastes lukewarm and dusty. Not a bit of it, it turns out, at least in part through a masterstroke of accidental chutzpah — the plot hinged on the escape of a terrible contagion, a world-ending biohazard. Not even Covid is so big it cannot be scaled up by Bond.</p> <p>What the real pandemic did, of course, was raise the stakes for a series already bearing unfeasible weight. Every film-maker craves a sense of occasion, but with cinema owners warning of bankruptcy without Bond to play, for producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson it must have approached too much of a good thing. A heretical thought — what if the film turned out to be a dog?</p> <p><em>No Time To Die</em> is not a dog. But the last Bond movie, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eec8fbde-7809-11e5-933d-efcdc3c11c89\"><em>Spectre</em></a>, was. Here, that makes everyone's job more challenging. A few select threads are picked up —&#xa0;notably Léa Seydoux's self-contained Madeleine Swann, with whom Bond at the beginning is in love. </p> <p>Mostly, though, a change of tack is demanded. Ever since Craig took the role in 2005, his project has been reinvention —&#xa0;creating a Bond fit for the 21st century. Now it is easy to mock his fusion of scowling trauma and luxury branding. At the time, it was badly needed. But <em>Spectre</em> —&#xa0;given the usual five-star reviews, actually a po-faced drag —&#xa0;was surely the end of that road. Where next?</p> <p>Here is where —&#xa0;the anti-<em>Spectre</em>. The script has been polished hard, given rhythm and singularity by writers including Phoebe Waller-Bridge of <em>Fleabag</em> fame. But much of the kudos belongs to director Cary Joji Fukunaga. As the British public are finding out, it takes skill to drive a juggernaut. Fukunaga reverses out of the dead end of <em>Spectre</em>, then does wheelies. His trick is to take everything the other Craig movies muted and crank them to 11. </p> <p>Darkness bubbles up —&#xa0;a key early scene plays like a slasher movie. But there is Hollywood heartache too — and a giddy sense of madcap. Craig makes his line deliveries loose and playful (“but then it all went <em>wronggg</em>,” he mugs.) A sequence in a Havana fleshpot with Monroe-ish Ana de Armas —&#xa0;also his co-star in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c58dafc6-1125-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae\"><em>Knives Out</em></a> —&#xa0;is an insta-classic blast of weird, gleeful, deadly screwball. Only the actors know if they were having fun. The crucial thing is — at last — it looks like it. </p> <p>Still, even now the marriage of old and new can feel tense. (“The infrastructure goes back to the 1950s,” Ben Whishaw's Q drily warns of an unsafe location.) The action is well mounted —&#xa0;a motorbike stunt in Puglia has the nonchalant brilliance of a good card trick —&#xa0;but a little has to go a long way in two hours and 43 minutes. </p> <p>And that oldest dependable of all —&#xa0;the Bond villain — is the weak link for the second film running. Rami Malek's Noh-mask-wearing Safin promises an improvement on poor Christoph Waltz, the sockless Blofeld of <em>Spectre</em>. Safin's lair is certainly quite something, a bravura nod back to the genius of late production designer Ken Adam. But the actor himself is lispingly clichéd, his visual signature — facial scarring — a retread of <em>Skyfall</em>'s Javier Bardem <em>and</em> a dated touch for a series eager to move with the times.</p> <p>Elsewhere, modernity is a flawless fit. In place of conquests and playmates, Bond is now surrounded on all sides by capable women, at least two of whom make clear —&#xa0;matter-of-factly — that they have no plans to sleep with a wrecked old spook with one functional knee. Aside from De Armas, Lashana Lynch is terrific as the young MI6 hotshot with whom Bond is left to jostle; Seydoux makes for a powerful riff on Jean-Luc Godard's '60s adage that all a movie needs is a girl and a gun. That implied they each also needed a man. Not Seydoux and her pistol. No wonder 007 is smitten. </p> <p>And Craig too seems finally content. Openly uneasy with so much about being Bond, the star has appeared to be leaving ever since he arrived (while, like the Queen, actually staying long enough for heirs to grow old waiting). Now, though, his long experiment to test how much reality a weary spy saga can take has produced the best film of that 16-year assignment — and at the perfect moment to do so. </p> <p>For Craig, the balancing act is over. For the rest of us, while <em>No Time To Die</em> is a much superior film to <em>Spectre</em>, it leaves us — triumphantly — with the same question. Where next?</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p>‘<em>No Time to Die' is in UK cinemas from September 30 and US cinemas from October 8</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'No Time to Die — Daniel Craig's Bond swansong is best of his reign' FT.com 29 September.
