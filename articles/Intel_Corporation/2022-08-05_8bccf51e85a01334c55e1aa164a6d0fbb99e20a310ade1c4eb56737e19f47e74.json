  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>Didi Chuxing <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5396f19c-af43-4f8f-8849-26a8218ac9fb\">is braced for further punishment</a> from Chinese regulators, after the ride-hailing group became a high-profile target of Beijing's crackdown on the country's tech giants, four Didi staff told the FT.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>SoftBank sells down its Alibaba stake</p></li>  <li><p>Tiger Global holds out hope</p></li>  <li><p>A lawyer faces his own day in court</p></li> </ul> <h1>The end of an era: SoftBank sells down Alibaba</h1> <p>Here's how you could've figured out that<strong> SoftBank </strong>had quietly sold more than a third of its <strong>Alibaba</strong> stake this year. </p> <ol>  <li><p>Find the names of the obscure Cayman Islands entities SoftBank uses (in this case, the apparently Arthurian legend-themed Gawain II 2022 Holdings Limited, Valiant I 2022 Holdings Limited and Valiant II 2022 Holdings Limited). </p></li>  <li><p>Get in touch with <strong>The Washington Service</strong>. The data group sends someone to the Securities and Exchange Commission every week to photocopy all new Form 144 filings that have been sent in by snail mail. Ask them to send you copies of the Alibaba-linked ones.</p></li>  <li><p>Get yourself up to speed with the workings of the “prepaid forward sale contracts” in SoftBank's Alibaba filings (essentially, they let SoftBank raise cash immediately but retain the option to hold on to the shares).&#xa0;</p></li> </ol> <p>It's almost as if SoftBank didn't want to immediately draw attention to the fact that it was cashing out chunks of its best-ever investment at multiyear lows, to raise $22bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the FT's Ryan McMorrow and Kana Inagaki and<strong> Wharton</strong> professor <strong>Daniel Taylor </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca7e1885-055c-43e8-8d2f-96ee5715cf0a\">have done the work</a>. </p> <p>Altogether, SoftBank has now sold more than half of its Alibaba holdings through these forward sales — which could shrink its stake in the company below the threshold for keeping its board seat. </p> <p>This is symbolically and financially significant for the Japanese conglomerate. Its Alibaba investment has been its golden goose since SoftBank's founder <strong>Masayoshi Son </strong>led a $20mn funding round for <strong>Jack Ma</strong>'s ecommerce start-up more than two decades ago. </p> <p>The huge returns on that investment enabled all of SoftBank's subsequent adventures. The billionaire duo have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a9847dc-180a-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">remained friends</a>. </p> <p>So why sell now? </p> <p>SoftBank is under financial pressure and Alibaba is its only liquid asset.</p> <p>Dozens of investments from SoftBank's first Vision Fund have slumped as tech stocks sold off. Its second Vision Fund, which failed to attract outside money, has invested in more than 200 start-ups, mostly at the dizziest peaks of the cycle. </p> <p>Some analysts fear Vision Fund II's losses could be as severe as the 60 per cent drops that high-growth tech stocks have seen, according to this <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-tech-downturn-startups-losses-vision-fund-masayoshi-son-11659456842\">Wall Street Journal deep-dive</a> on SoftBank's predicament. </p> <p>In May, Son promised investors he would play “defence” after announcing a $27bn investment loss for the Vision Fund during the previous business year.</p> <p>This being SoftBank, it has turned to financial engineering for solutions. Since 2020 it has raised $30bn from forward sales of Alibaba and has funnelled some of that money into Vision Fund II. </p> <p>SoftBank had separately pledged 164mn Alibaba shares as collateral for $6bn of loans at the end of March. As Alibaba's share price has tumbled over the past two years, SoftBank has been forced to repay billions of dollars in loans collateralised by the share block.</p> <p>The FT estimates that, when you combine the derivative deals and the pledging of shares, SoftBank may have in total leveraged more than 80 per cent of its Alibaba holdings. </p> <p>It's not clear what SoftBank will do with the $22bn. Will it plough that cash into more highly speculative investments? Deleverage its balance sheet? </p> <p>Either way, Son is hopeful that the next Alibaba-style success story is around the corner. Asked by a shareholder in June how many of its 475 portfolio companies had the potential for such greatness, he said one to three. </p> <p>Then he added: “But one or two, if they become such a success, then that's going to give us a return for everything.”</p> <h1>Tiger Global gets a swimming lesson</h1> <p>For investors hoping to stay afloat in today's volatile stock market, knowing how to swim is crucial. </p> <p>At <strong>Chase</strong> <strong>Coleman</strong>'s <strong>Tiger</strong> <strong>Global</strong> that meant having 23-time Olympic gold medallist <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Phelps</strong> offer life lessons from the swimming pool to the beleaguered fund this summer.</p> <p>“One of the messages we have consistently heard from Michael and other high performers over the years is that the path to long-term success is rarely linear,” recounted Tiger of the pep talk, in a letter to investors.</p> <p>Tiger offered a masterpiece in hedge fund speak when explaining why it had lost billions of dollars this year amid a 50 per cent plunge in its flagship fund, which was launched by Coleman in 2001 after he cut his teeth at <strong>Julian</strong> <strong>Robertson</strong>'s <strong>Tiger</strong> <strong>Management</strong>. </p> <p>“Setbacks and losses are part of the deal,” continued Tiger of the Phelpsian wisdom it acquired, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87347d49-390d-408b-9059-2e5a42b5787c\">according to a quarterly letter</a> obtained by DD's Antoine Gara. “The ability to persevere through them and use them as fuel for future wins is part of what differentiates the all-time greats.”</p> <p>Swimming lessons aside, Tiger diagnosed what went wrong in 2022 by blaming inflation.</p> <p>In the past, it brushed off fears of inflation because it believed technological change was “deflationary”. The concept worked during a decade-long bull market as its heavy exposure to tech stocks made it among the best-performing funds in the world. </p> <p>Surging inflation and a hawkish <strong>Federal Reserve </strong>this year caught the fund unprepared. </p> <p>The results have been gruesome. </p> <p>In addition to the halving of its flagship fund, Tiger's long-only strategy has declined over 60 per cent through to the end of July and a hybrid fund mixing public and private investments has declined about 35 per cent. </p> <p>As Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a34b080c-7f58-4864-8f3a-19bc585a6e56\">notes</a>, Tiger has found some refuge in private investments not subject to the spotlight of public markets.</p> <p>Though Tiger admitted to mistakes, it won't change its stripes. </p> <p>“[W]e believe the same approach we applied in those first 20 years — with improvements and additional perspective from new battle scars — will recover losses and generate the long-term, superior performance that is our mission and expectation.”</p> <p>Stocks may be sinking, but hope floats.</p> <h1>A ‘colossally stupid' decision gets its day in court</h1> <p>There are certain do's and don'ts when it comes to lawyering. One clear no-no is telling your client to destroy evidence when told to preserve it by a judge. </p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7950c4ef-c035-4d84-b1a4-22498b2ecd5e\">that's exactly what</a> former <strong>Jones Day</strong> partner <strong>Raymond McKeeve </strong>was found in contempt of court for on Wednesday. McKeeve deliberately thwarted a search order obtained by <strong>Ocado</strong> as part of a corporate espionage probe, a UK High Court judge ruled.</p> <p>McKeeve had been advising<strong> Today Development Partners</strong>, set up by Ocado co-founder <strong>Jonathan Faiman</strong>. The supermarket group had accused Faiman and another former Ocado employee <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a4a4ff2-3a0a-4165-9f24-d248147d44d2\">of stealing its confidential information</a> to set up a rival venture, in a dispute that was settled last year.</p> <p>As part of the spat, Ocado secured a search order designed to preserve evidence, which covered electronic data held on a phone and messaging app used by Today. Before it could be searched, McKeeve told Today's IT manager to “burn” the app, a decision the judge called a “spontaneous act of colossal stupidity”.&#xa0;</p> <p>McKeeve said he was trying to protect his wife<strong> Belinda de Lucy</strong>, a former MEP for the Brexit party, whose name Today had been using as a pseudonym to protect the identity of a former Ocado employee who was on gardening leave.</p> <p>Justice <strong>Adam Johnson</strong> said McKeeve's regret seemed “entirely genuine”. But judges are not keen on those who flout their orders (as UK business tycoon<strong> Frederick Barclay</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da7e29bc-bd5f-4864-ac70-aebbe708c655\">learned last week</a>), and contempt can result in jail time. McKeeve will be hoping that a “colossally stupid” decision doesn't have colossally serious consequences. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Pimco</strong>, the $2tn California-based bond fund manager, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/632f9e69-21a8-4f15-9f47-13c7a5351a4f\">has hired</a> former Federal Reserve vice-chair <strong>Richard Clarida </strong>as global economic adviser and managing director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has appointed <strong>Isaac Davies</strong> as treasurer for the bank's Europe operations, based in Dublin. He was previously North Asia treasurer at <strong>Bank of America</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Morrison Foerster</strong> has elected<strong> Kelley Howes</strong> as partner.
