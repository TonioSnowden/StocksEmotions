  "text": "<p>Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said delays in the rollout of a new chip family for data centers and continued supply-chain troubles compounded the PC weakness.</p><p>The results were \"below our expectations, below what we committed to our shareholders,\" he said, adding \"we're quite disappointed by that.\"</p><p>The semiconductor titan had a net loss of $454 million.</p><p>Higher interest rates and inflation have hit consumers' pocketbooks around the world, and the return to in-person work has softened demand for PCs that people bought in droves over the past two years to facilitate remote work and distance schooling.</p><p>The division that houses Intel's PC chips reported a 25% fall in revenue to $7.7 billion, and sales at its data-center-chip division fell 16% to $4.6 billion.</p><p>PC customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in a decade, Mr. Gelsinger said in a call with analysts. PC makers typically reduce inventory levels of chips when they are expecting lower sales.</p><p>The chip maker said revenue in the current quarter should be $15 billion to $16 billion. Wall Street had been expecting sales of more than $18 billion. For the full year, Intel now expects sales of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from $76 billion.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said the sharp fall in consumer appetite would probably ease the global chip shortage that has persisted for two years.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
