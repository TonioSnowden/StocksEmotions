  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Twitter shares jumped 8 per cent after Hindenburg Research — best known as a short seller — said it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbfb24a7-fbf1-48a4-b638-f6a8c0b72683\">built “a significant” stake</a> in the social media company that is in a legal battle with Elon Musk.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Twitter using Musk's tweets against him</p></li>  <li><p>A look inside Celsius</p></li>  <li><p>India takes on a former Elliott fund manager</p></li> </ul> <h1>The highlight of the Twitter lawsuit? Musk's tweets</h1> <p>“Never tweet” is, ironically, one of the most recognised <strong>Twitter</strong> memes.</p> <p>In the case of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, it's just good advice. </p> <p>Twitter has armed itself with the billionaire's own tweets in its fight to force Musk to honour his agreement to buy the company at the original price of $52.40 per share. Scroll through the 62-page complaint, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b99b98ed-9952-4b4f-ba46-24f863a33af2\">filed on Tuesday</a>, and you'll see several screenshots of his posts. </p> <p>The point, of course, is to portray Musk as being in flagrant disregard of the merger agreement. </p> <p>Twitter's lawyers are seeking to prove that Musk isn't attempting to walk away because of the bot issue, as he claims. They say it has more to do with how the market has turned against him, his wealth has fallen significantly — though let's not forget he's still the richest person in the world — and the deal no longer serves his interests. </p> <p>DD's Sujeet Indap and the FT's Hannah Murphy set out the various arguments made by Twitter in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1e69394-9eba-4f38-bf50-2fbf542b0f01\">this analysis</a>. </p> <p>The lawsuit also reveals several other interesting details about the deal. For example, Twitter was relieved that Musk had retained Bob Swan, the former Intel chief executive, as an adviser on the transaction. But they later learnt, via a text message, that the billionaire had dumped Swan in late June. </p> <p>After “secretly” building a 9.1 per cent stake in Twitter — Musk didn't disclose his position to the regulator when he was required to — he gave <strong>Parag Agrawal</strong>, the company's chief executive, and <strong>Bret Taylor</strong>, its board chair, three options: he would join the company's board, take over the business or start a competitor.</p> <p>Musk was offered, and accepted, a board seat but days later changed his mind. Then came the unsolicited bid for Twitter, accompanied by a threat&#xa0; to “reconsider my position as a shareholder” if his offer wasn't accepted.</p> <p>The lawsuit contends that the bot issue is a poor excuse for abandoning the deal. After all, Musk repeatedly said he wanted to buy Twitter to solve the bot issue. </p> <p>Chancellor<strong> Kathaleen McCormick</strong>, the judge that will hear the case, previously ruled in favour of <strong>DecoPac</strong> <strong>Holdings</strong> as it forced private equity firm <strong>Kohlberg &amp; Co</strong> to complete a March 2020 buyout. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Rossman</strong>, a <strong>Quinn</strong> <strong>Emanuel </strong>lawyer who represented the victors in that case, is now advising Musk. </p> <p>None of which has stopped Musk tweeting. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he wrote on Twitter: “Oh the irony lol.” Indeed. </p> <h1>How Celsius went into meltdown</h1> <p>A month ago, cryptocurrency lender <strong>Celsius</strong> <strong>Network</strong> became one of the first shoes to drop in a credit crisis that has engulfed the industry.</p> <p>It froze the funds of hundreds of thousands of customers who had deposited their crypto with Celsius to earn eye-popping interest rates as high as 18 per cent.</p> <p>The $3bn company counted investor <strong>Laurence</strong> <strong>Tosi</strong>'s <strong>WestCap</strong>, and <strong>CDPQ</strong>, Canada's second-largest pension fund, among its backers. At its peak last year, Celsius managed $25bn worth of crypto.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10600233.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Since halting withdrawals, Celsius has said little about its financial position or the fate of its customers' savings as regulators begin to circle. It has so far been able to avoid bankruptcy.</p> <p>Now, our FT colleagues Kadhim Shubber and Joshua Oliver <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fa06516-119b-4722-946b-944e38b02f45\">have written a deep dive</a> into the problems at Celsius, finding evidence the company had taken big risks with its customers' funds, mismanaged its breakneck growth and likely now has a hole in its balance sheet, possibly as large as $2bn.</p> <p>Among their findings are internal Celsius documents showing that the company's co-founders sold some $40mn worth of sales of Celsius' native token, while Celsius' compliance department issued warnings about poor oversight, weak controls and the possible misrepresentation of financial information.</p> <p>The story raises awkward questions for WestCap and CDPQ. When they led a $750mn funding round last year, they boasted about the due diligence they had done. “We are very careful . . . our due diligence process is very serious,” CDPQ <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b379157c-93ae-4e28-8bf0-9f777811efd3\">told the FT</a> at the time. These days they're declining to comment.</p> <p>Celsius too is saying little. The company has been unwinding positions in the world of decentralised finance, or DeFi. It recently brought on new restructuring lawyers from <strong>Kirkland</strong> <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>Ellis</strong>. This week, the Vermont state regulator warned that Celsius was “deeply insolvent”.</p> <p>It's a far cry from Celsius' happier days, when its founders were mocking <strong>Warren</strong> <strong>Buffett</strong>, portraying themselves as heirs to <strong>Robin Hood</strong>, and claiming to be “safer than most banks”.</p> <h1>India's $1.3bn political gamble</h1> <p>Former <strong>Elliott Management</strong> fund manager <strong>Jay</strong> <strong>Newman</strong>, best known for extracting $2.4bn from the Argentine government in a 15-year creditor battle, could be facing his toughest test yet in India.</p> <p>Newman<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0eb70a27-1878-4a26-a8ad-95fcc191b0f0\"> cut short his retirement</a>, during which he'd<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Undermoney-Jay-Newman/dp/1982156023\"> written a thriller</a>, to advise the shareholders of a Bangalore-based satellite company called <strong>Devas</strong> <strong>Multimedia</strong>.</p> <p>Devas had signed a contract with an Indian government firm called <strong>Antrix</strong> back in 2005 to develop broadband, but in 2011 Antrix cancelled the contract. Devas has subsequently won a series of tribunal decisions, awarding it a hefty $1.3bn, which India refuses to pay.</p> <p>The dispute is already spilling over into courts around the world. Devas shareholders have tried to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1c4cbbc-bddc-4051-9c3a-44ee575d3a1e\"> seize revenues</a> from <strong>Air</strong> <strong>India</strong> and a property in Paris's upmarket 16th arrondissement (incidentally the same one that<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac0e2c3d-e50c-418e-a43a-5a8ca2c803ad\"> Cairn Energy froze</a> last year during its dispute with New Delhi).</p> <p>In<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50374dd2-b0b7-4e5c-af1a-5025b85bfdf6\"> the latest instalment</a> of the saga, the FT's Laurence Fletcher and Benjamin Parkin reveal how Devas executives had met in secret with prime minister <strong>Narendra</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>'s national security adviser to hash out a provisional settlement of hundreds of millions of dollars. But suddenly, without explanation, the Indian government walked away.</p> <p>While it has settled its disputes with <strong>Cairn</strong> (now <strong>Capricorn</strong> <strong>Energy</strong>) and <strong>Vodafone</strong>, Modi's government appears to be taking a political gamble with Devas, branding the original 2005 deal a “fraud of the [opposition] Congress [party], by the Congress, for the Congress” and vowing it would “no way” settle “with frauds”.</p> <p>With neither side appearing ready to back down, Newman may not get time to write another novel anytime soon.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Barr</strong>, a former dean of public policy at the <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Michigan</strong>, has been confirmed as the <strong>Federal</strong> <strong>Reserve's</strong> <strong>vice-chair of supervision</strong>, filling a crucial oversight role for large financial institutions at the US central bank.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>L Catterton </strong>has appointed <strong>Shahab</strong> <strong>Rashid</strong> as managing partner and co-head of its new private credit business as the $33bn in assets private equity firm expands into debt investments.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Family feud</strong> After decades of disagreement between sibling heirs of a luxury cruise company, the Lefebvre d'Ovidio brothers <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-13/italian-cruise-billionaire-mired-in-family-feud-over-his-fortune?sref=fLR6XBbO\">are gearing up</a> for a final episode of their family feud that will take place in Bologna, Bloomberg reports. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Ukraine's secret weapon</strong> AeroVironment, a little known US contractor run by a “nerdy group of misfits”, has gained prominence after its “kamikaze” drones became an emblem of the Ukrainian resistance.
