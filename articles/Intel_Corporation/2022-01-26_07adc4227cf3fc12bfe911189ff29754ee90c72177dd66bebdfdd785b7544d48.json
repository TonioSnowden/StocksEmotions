  "text": "<p>Stocks have been rocked in recent days by expectations that the Fed will embark on a series of rate increases this year to temper heightened inflation. The prospect of a shrinking balance sheet and higher rates has prompted some to sell risky assets, including shares of technology companies that promise future returns, and cryptocurrencies. Investors are also monitoring rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have drawn the focus of NATO allies.</p><p>Economists expect the Fed to confirm expectations that it will start raising rates in March when it releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET. Traders in interest-rate futures markets are betting that the Fed will increase rates four or five times this year, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"Today the focus is going to be on the Fed,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"It's more about the tone of the press conference. People may have an expectation that given the market turmoil and the geopolitical tensions the Fed may tone down its rhetoric.\"</p><p>The VIX, a measure of expected volatility that is sometimes dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, ticked down 2.6 points to 28.6. The gauge rose this week as stock markets fell.</p><p>Results season continues, and earnings are due ahead of the market open from big-name companies including AT&amp;T, Abbott Laboratories and Boeing. Tesla and Intel are slated to report after markets close.</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Texas Instruments gained 4.4% after the company reported a higher revenue. Microsoft shares rose 4.2% after the software giant said its earnings continued to grow as its cloud-services business stayed strong.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note crept up to 1.789% Wednesday from 1.784% Tuesday. Yields move inversely to prices.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 jumped 1.9%, with the biggest gains in the travel and leisure sector. Stock indexes in Asia closed mixed. China's Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi each declined 0.4%.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value rose 3.5% from its 5 p.m. ET level Tuesday to $37,895. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has recently sagged alongside broader markets, shedding nearly half its value from its November peak.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise After a Rocky Week as Fed Rates Call Looms</p>",
