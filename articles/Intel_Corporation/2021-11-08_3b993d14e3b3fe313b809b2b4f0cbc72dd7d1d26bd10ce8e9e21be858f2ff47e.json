  "text": "<p>The Future of Everything covers the innovation and technology transforming the way we live, work and play, with monthly issues on education, money, cities and more. This month is Transportation, online starting Nov. 3 and in print Nov 10.</p><p>A Motorcycle That's Above it All</p><p>The Speeder is a futuristic-looking flying motorcycle created by Ventura, Calif.-based Jetpack Aviation. Though some elements are still in development, the vertical take-off-and-landing aircraft will have jet turbine engines that provide vertical thrust. Once in the air, the engines would tilt backward and the aircraft would fly on small wings powered by net-zero-carbon fuel. Two recreational models, priced starting at $385,000 each, are available for preorder. One reaches speeds of over 150 mph, and flies for nearly an hour at more than 15,000 feet; an ultralight version that doesn't require a pilot's license to operate is limited to 60 mph by federal regulations and flies for 15 minutes. The company hopes to make them available in 2023. A faster, heavy-duty model intended for military and rescue missions is also in development. Within 10 years, the recreational Speeder could be automated and used for public transportation in cities, with rooftops repurposed for parking, says CEO David Mayman.</p><p>Smarter, Safer Wheelchairs</p><p>Between 65% and 80% of wheelchair users injure themselves each year with tips or falls, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. LUCI, an accessory that mounts on power wheelchairs, uses stereovision, infrared, ultrasonic and radar sensors, and Intel Corp.'s RealSense cameras to map the chair's surroundings so it can better navigate curbs, obstacles and tipping scenarios. It offers audible anti-tipping alerts, low-battery alerts, automated speed control and location monitors for users and caregivers in case of tips. Available since February for $8,445, LUCI has prevented over 10,000 accidents, says co-founder Barry Dean.</p><p>Next year, Mr. Dean and his engineer brother, Jered Dean, plan to launch additional products that automatically unload pressure to shift the user's weight and prevent pressure sores. The team is working with the Colorado Smart Cities Alliance to map the accessibility of \"forgotten spaces\" like sidewalks and alleys. \"This type of information not only gives wheelchair users more independence, but can be applicable to delivery bots or parents with a stroller,\" Jered Dean says.</p><p>Manual wheelchairs are also getting upgrades. U.K.-based Phoenix Instinct is set to debut in 2023 a smart wheelchair that adjusts its center of gravity when the chair is on a slope and slows down. And Toyota Motor Corp. is developing a device that attaches to a chair's leg rests and will stop or slow to avoid obstacles, reducing stress on a user's arms.</p><p>Scoot Along in Style</p><p>Segway's latest crack at urban mobility is the S-Pod, an electric-powered, egg-shaped armchair on wheels. Aimed at an older demographic, the self-balancing device can travel 43 miles at speeds of up to 24 mph on a single charge. Riders navigate using a joystick. Segway first plans to roll out S-Pods at airports, shopping malls, theme parks and corporate campuses as early as next year. Autonomous versions for city use are years away.</p><p>Toyota's C+walk, a three-wheeled standing electric scooter developed for the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, went on sale in October in Japan for around $3,000. The company is developing a seated version for commercial use that will have three speed settings that max out at 4 mph, spokesman Aaron Fowles says. Both models are intended for pedestrian-friendly zones.</p><p>Float on the Air</p><p>Will a hoverboard that effortlessly floats above the ground ever be reality? Lexus and a team of magnetic-levitation scientists spent 18 months developing a prototype called the Slide. The board contains blocks of a superconductive metal alloy cooled to -197 degrees Celsius (-322.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by reservoirs of liquid nitrogen inside the board. The team constructed a hoverpark with a magnetic track beneath the surface. When a superconductor is cooled and placed in a magnetic field, an interaction known as the Meissner effect repels the force of gravity and allows the board to levitate. Placed above the track, the Slide hovered about an inch off the ground. When the liquid nitrogen runs out, the superconductors warm and the hoverboard drops to the ground. Lexus developed the technology for an advertising campaign around innovation, and it was ridden by a professional skateboarder. It wasn't intended for commercial use, says Mr. Fowles.</p><p>Better Electric Motorbikes</p><p>With lighter, longer lasting batteries, electric motorbikes are starting to get more practical and accessible, promising a widespread, emissions-free alternative for urban commuters. The Xubaka, a two-seater with vintage-cool design from France's Sodium Cycles, weighs 132 pounds, including the battery, and can hit 50 mph. A passive regeneration system recovers up to 14% of the battery power while braking, and a rear seat can be replaced with utility-oriented accessories, making it more of a cargo scooter. It was launched in Europe in January with prices starting at $6,870.</p><p>Italian brand Piaggio this summer unveiled a lighter, cheaper version of its electric Vespa called the Piaggio One. Priced at $3,100 in Europe, the bike doesn't require a motorcycle license to operate because it tops out at 28 mph.</p><p>Swedish electric bike company CAKE's first city bike, the Makka, starts at $3,800. Available for preorder for early 2022 deliveries in the U.S. and Europe, it has customizable features like bicycle bags, racks and an additional passenger seat. Weighing just over 140 pounds, the moped reaches 28 mph with a range of up to 30 miles a charge. CAKE has also introduced a $4,200 version that is compatible with Polestar 2 electric cars. The bike mounts to a rear rack, plugs into the car and charges as customers drive the highway. When they arrive in the city, customers can complete the last mile on their e-bike.</p><p>Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com</p><p>Flying Motorcycles, Better E-Bikes and More Personal Transportation to Come</p>",
