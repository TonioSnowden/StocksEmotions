  "title": "Technology:  Chip Shortage Puts Focus  On Texas Instruments  ----  By Yang Jie",
  "text": "<p>   In the digital age, some of the most sought-after devices are analog semiconductors -- including ones made by 91-year-old Texas Instruments Inc., the company known to consumers for calculators that have been around since the 1970s. </p><p>   Technology executives say this year's supply-chain bottlenecks, which have hit parts for everything from iPhones to Ford F-150s, are particularly acute in chips that don't shuffle zeros and ones. Analog chips treat incoming information about temperature, sound and electrical current more like a human would, on a scale with many gradations. </p><p>   Among the biggest analog chip makers is Dallas-based Texas Instruments, founded in 1930. Students and engineers know TI for its hand-held calculators, which it still makes. But its $170 billion market capitalization is built on its dominance in analog chips, where it holds 17% to 20% of the world market this year, according to Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce. </p><p>   While makers of sophisticated digital chips such as Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. get most of the spotlight, a lack of analog chips costing a few dollars apiece can hold up supply chains for products with tens of billions of dollars in sales. </p><p>    Samson Hu, co-chief executive of Taiwan-based laptop maker Asustek Computer Inc., recently lamented that his factory assembly lines were getting disrupted by a shortage of analog chips managing battery use or amplifying sound effects. </p><p>   \"The uncertainty, as we have observed, lies with a certain big American IDM company, \" Mr. Hu said in November on an earnings call. He didn't name the company, but industry officials said that based on Mr. Hu's description of the company's products, he was talking about Texas Instruments. A spokeswoman for Asustek declined to comment, and representatives for Texas Instruments didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Hu said he expected supply from the American company to remain tight until its capacity expansion next year. TI has said a new $6 billion factory is set to open in Richardson, Texas, in the second half of 2022. </p><p>    Apple Inc.'s chief executive, Tim Cook, talked in an October earnings call about the sales opportunities Apple is losing because parts shortages mean it can't make enough iPhones and other devices. </p><p>   Besides Texas Instruments, major analog-chip makers include Analog Devices Inc. of Wilmington, Mass., and two European companies, Infineon Technologies AG and STMicroelectronics NV. </p><p>   Industry executives and analysts say TI's problems in meeting demand resemble those of other companies but that it tends to get more attention because of its leading position. </p><p>   Texas Instruments says it is doing its best to serve customers and acknowledges that some aren't getting everything they want. \"Clearly, we're well below where we want to be\" in inventory, said Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi in an October earnings call. </p><p>   The company has new capacity in the works that it says will require tens of billions of dollars in investment, with construction starting next year on two factories in Sherman, Texas. </p><p>   Yet analog-chip makers have been cautious about expanding because of the industry's history of booms and busts. Texas Instruments executives have said they want to be disciplined in addressing customer demand. </p><p></p>",
