  "text": "<p>* Snap shares plummeted 20% premarket. The social-media company said it expects growth to slow in the current quarter because of recent changes to Apple's App Store privacy rules.</p><p>* Other big names in social media were dragged down as well. Facebook fell 3.8% premarket, and Twitter shed 3.9%.</p><p>* Intel shares dropped 10% premarket. The semiconductor company disappointed investors even as it posted stronger third-quarter earnings, as component shortages weighed on computer shipments and China's crackdown on gaming hurt server-chip sales.</p><p>* American Express shares nudged up 1.4% ahead of the bell. The credit-card company topped earnings and revenue estimates as it benefited from an acceleration in spending and saw further recovery in the travel and entertainment categories.</p><p>* Honeywell shed 0.8%. The industrial conglomerate lowered its sales guidance for the year due to supply-chain constraints and the ongoing effects of what it described as a \"macro-challenged environment.\"</p><p>* Zoom Video Communications gained 2.7%. The stock got a ratings upgrade from JPMorgan.</p><p>* Mattel shot 6.7% higher. The toy maker raised its full-year sales outlook after posting better than expected third-quarter results, with strong sales continuing for key brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels.</p><p>* Whirlpool slid 2.4% after the appliance maker's chief executive said shortages of dishwashers and refrigerators are likely to stretch well into next year, as supply-chain problems constrain production and consumer demand remains strong.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* A key measure of investors' inflation expectations has climbed in recent weeks, adding fuel to concerns about lasting pressures on consumer prices.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>DWAC, Snap, Intel, Mattel: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
