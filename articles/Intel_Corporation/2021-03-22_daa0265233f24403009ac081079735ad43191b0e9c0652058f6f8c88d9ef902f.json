  "text": "<p>A couple of years ago, Daniel Price, who helped organise the first G20 leaders' summit, made a persuasive argument in the pages of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/02/world-leaders-should-act-avoid-digital-crisis-before-its-too-late/\">Washington Post</a>. </p> <p>Tech is moving faster than governments, he said, and world leaders should act before a crisis blows up in the digital economy. </p> <p>He called for a new global body, a ‘data and technology board', to advise governments on making tech policy. It would mirror the Financial Stability Board set up after the financial crisis, he said. </p> <p>Fast forward two years, and Mastercard, Visa, IBM, Qualcomm, SoftBank and others are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28891b9d-a301-40e6-8acc-59728ac8fcd8\">repeating the call</a>. <br><br>They are asking the G7 to set up a forum to set some internationally agreed principles for the use of tech, starting with cyber security, cross-border data transfers and AI. </p> <p>It is a neat idea. Global co-operation on using AI, or to set the rules of engagement for cyber security and cyberwarfare, would be welcome. </p> <p>But it is also easy to see why the companies are so keen on it. There is a good chance that a global forum would be captured by industry, and used to push less inconvenient rules than those being drawn up by the national regulators that are currently circling Big Tech.</p> <p>The FSB and the Basel III regulatory framework succeeded because the financial services industry was reeling from a crisis, its leaders scared that they had blown up the world. Without the same impetus, it is not clear that another talking shop would carry enough weight to have a similar impact. </p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>Deliveroo prices</strong> </p> <p>Deliveroo<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22314a4b-5647-48b2-991c-d70639f7ccda\"> said</a> it would sell 384m shares in next week's IPO at between £3.90 and £4.60 each, valuing it at £8.2bn at the midpoint of the range. If it hits the top of the range, the meal delivery app would be London's biggest IPO for a decade, both by capital raised and market cap, since Glencore in 2011. </p> <p><strong>Airbnb mobilises its local hosts</strong><br><br>Those local homeowners turning up at planning meetings to have their say about Airbnb? Perhaps they are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1afb3173-444a-47fa-99ec-554779dde236\">not as independent as they seem</a>. Researchers at Manchester university found that the company helps them with political and media training, and suggestions for which hearings to show up to. </p> <p><strong>Delays to the EU's tech regulations? </strong><br><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e08efbb-dd96-4bea-8260-01502aaf1bd7\">reshaping of Europe's tech regulations</a>, in the form of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, is being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43e5b142-a3ef-4779-aaf0-0f9cc027a896\">hampered by squabbles </a>between groups in the European parliament. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner hoping to push through the rules by spring 2022, told MEPs: “Now's the moment — as Bowie might have put it — when you can be heroes.” </p> <p><strong>Tsinghua Unigroup chased by bondholders</strong><br><br>China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21d70ba3-f3c7-4f2a-b311-c5850d0d1af6\">chip champion is being chased</a> by its international bondholders after defaulting on a domestic bond. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft Office</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4\">Microsoft</a> is planning to start reopening its Redmond and Seattle, Washington-based headquarters from March 29, according to the Verge. The software giant originally started&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164522/microsoft-coronavirus-response-comment-employees-memo-work-from-home\">encouraging employees to work from home</a>&#xa0;more than a year ago and the company's main US offices have remained closed for months as a result. </p> <h2>Tech week ahead</h2> <p><em><strong>Tuesday:</strong> </em>Intel's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51f63b07-aeb8-4961-9ce9-c1f7a4e326f0\">new chief executive Pat Gelsinger </a>is going to lay out his vision for the US chip giant. Analysts will be hoping for some answers on how Intel can catch up with the technical prowess of the contract chipmaker TSMC, and how it will make its next generation of PC and server chips. </p> <p>In Asia, China's search engine Baidu will start trading in Hong Kong, after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e74d8f51-df67-4644-8b6c-07e96446260c\">raising $3.1 billion in a “homecoming” secondary listing</a>. Bilibili, the video sharing platform, is also expected to set the price for its secondary listing in Hong Kong. </p> <p><em><strong>Wednesday:</strong></em>&#xa0;Tencent posts its full-year results, as worries continue that the gaming and messaging giant will come under more regulatory pressure. </p> <p><em><strong>Thursday:</strong></em>&#xa0;Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey are back in Washington, this time for a congressional hearing about social media's “role in promoting extremism and misinformation”. Elsewhere in DC, the Senate finance committee is exploring the impact of digital tax proposals on US jobs. </p> <h2>Tech tools — Speak to Captain Kirk </h2> <p>Now 90, the actor William Shatner has created an interactive conversational video so that his friends, family and fans can interact with him for ever, or as the company puts it: “Beyond the limitations of time and space.”</p> <p>“This is for all my children and all my children's children and all my children's loved ones and all the loved ones of the loved ones,” said Shatner. “That's my gift to you down through time.” </p> <p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/527120911\">Here</a> he is in action. </p><p>Source: Malcolm Moore in London 2021 'Tech tries to win friends and influence people' FT.com 22 March.
