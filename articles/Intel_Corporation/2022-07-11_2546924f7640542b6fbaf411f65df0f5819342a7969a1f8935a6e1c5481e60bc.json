  "title": "PC shipments plunging, consumer demand 'at risk of perishing in the long term,' analysis finds; China COVID shutdowns, supply chain problems, recession fears all contribute to 15.3% decline in second-quarter shipments, with Apple and HP suffering the biggest declines",
  "text": "<p>\"Fears over a recession continue to mount and weaken demand across segments,\" Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobile Device Trackers unit, said in a statement.</p><p>\"Consumer demand for PCs has weakened in the near term and is at risk of perishing in the long term as consumers become more cautious about their spending and once again grow accustomed to computing across device types such as phones and tablets,\" Ubrani said. \"Meanwhile, commercial demand has been more robust although it has also declined as businesses delay purchases.\"</p><p>This year's second-quarter sales are similar to those at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when volumes for the second quarter of 2020 were 74.3 million, IDC said. PC sales boomed during the first two years of the pandemic as consumers and businesses stocked up to work from home and use videoconferencing software such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM that taxed older computers.</p><p>From April: The pandemic PC boom is over, but its legacy will live on</p><p>China's Lenovo Group Ltd. HK:992 led the pack in shipments, according to IDC tabulations, with shipments declining 12.1% to 17.5 million units, as HP shipments dropped 27.6% to 13.5 million units.</p><p>Dell Technologies Inc.'s DELL shipments declined 5.3% to 13.2 million units, while Acer Inc.'s TW:2353 shipments dropped 19.2% to 5 million units.</p><p>Apple and Asustek Computer Inc. TW:2357 tied for a \"statistical\" fifth place, IDC said, with Apple shipments dropping 22.5% to 4.8 million units, and Asustek shipments declining 4.6% to 4.7 million units.</p><p>See also: Mac renaissance shows Apple winning 'in a market where everyone counted them out'</p><p>And there don't seem to be any signs of improvement, Citi Research analyst Christopher Danley said in a Monday note.</p><p>While June notebook shipments were up 31% month-over-month, that was below his expectation of a 40% rise.</p><p>\"We expect PC demand to continue to decline throughout 2022 in to 2023,\" Danley said. The analyst reiterated his neutral ratings both on Intel Corp. INTC and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD although Intel appears more at risk when it comes to a PC downturn.</p><p>Danley said that while AMD derives about 35% of its revenue from the PC industry, 90% of Intel's sales come from PC and server segments.</p><p>PC shipments plunging, consumer demand 'at risk of perishing in the long term,' analysis finds</p>",
