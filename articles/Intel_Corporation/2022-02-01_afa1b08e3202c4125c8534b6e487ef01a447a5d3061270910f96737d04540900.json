  "title": "AMD stock rallies nearly 10% after earnings, revenue, outlook blow past Street view",
  "text": "<p>AMD AMD shares soared 9% after hours, following a 2.2% gain in the regular session to close at $116.78.</p><p>AMD reported fourth-quarter net income of $974 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $1.78 billion, or $1.45 a share, in the year-ago period. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reported earnings of 92 cents a share, compared with 52 cents a share in the year-ago period.</p><p>Revenue rose to $4.83 billion from $3.24 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share on revenue of $4.52 billion, after AMD projected between $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.</p><p>“Each of our businesses performed extremely well, with data center revenue doubling year-over-year driven by growing adoption of AMD EPYC processors across cloud and enterprise customers,” said AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su in a statement. “We expect another year of significant growth in 2022 as we ramp our current portfolio and launch our next generation of PC, gaming and data center products.”</p><p>Gross margins came in at 50% for the fourth quarter, up from 45% in the year ago quarter, and 48% for the third quarter. The 50% margin milestone is significant for AMD as larger rival Intel Corp. INTC has been dealing with shrinking margins, which executives have assured would stay “comfortably above 50%,” or in the 52% to 53% range for the year.</p><p>Sales from enterprise, embedded and semi-custom chips — the unit that includes data-center and gaming-console revenue — rose to $2.24 billion, compared with $1.28 billion a year ago. Analysts had forecast $2.1 billion.</p><p>In AMD's computing and graphics segment, the company reported second-quarter sales of $2.58 billion, up from $1.96 billion last year, compared with analyst expectations of $2.42 billion.</p><p>AMD said it expects first-quarter revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, while analysts had forecast $4.35 billion.</p><p>For 2022, AMD forecast gross margins of 51% for the year and said it expects about about $21.5 billion, a 31% gain from 2021's $16.43 billion. Analysts had forecast $16.13 billion for 2021 and $19.29 billion for 2022.</p><p>Last quarter, AMD had raised its full-year sales guidance — as it has in every quarterly earnings report so far this year — for growth of about 65% year-over-year.</p><p>Recently, AMD received conditional regulatory approval from Chinese regulators for its $35 billion deal to acquire Xilinx Inc. XLNX even more significant. AMD disclosed late last year it expected the deal to close this quarter.</p><p>At the close, AMD shares remained firmly in bear market territory, 29% off their closing high of $161.91 set on Nov. 29, but have still gained 32% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX is up 16% over that time, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 20%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has gained 6.5%.</p>",
