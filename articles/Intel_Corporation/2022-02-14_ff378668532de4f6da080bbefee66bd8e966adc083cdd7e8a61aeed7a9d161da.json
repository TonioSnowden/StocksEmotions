  "text": "<p>U.S.-traded shares of Tower TSEMIL:TSEM soared 50% after hours, following a 2% decline in the regular session to close at $33.13. At Monday's close, the company had a market capitalization of $3.54 billion, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Read: Semiconductor sales top half a trillion dollars for the first time, and are expected to keep growing</p><p>The company, which makes a wide variety of chips ranging from those catering to the consumer, industrial, automotive and mobile markets, has manufacturing facilities —- called “fabs” in industry parlance — in Migdal Haemek, Israel; Agrate, Italy, Newport Beach, Calif.; and San Antonio, Texas, according to Tower's website.</p><p>Tower also owns a 51% stake in TPSCo. with Nuvoton Technology Corp. TW:4919 having a 49% stake. That partnership has three fabs in Japan that specialize in integrated circuits, more than 750 million of which have gone to the auto industry, according to Tower.</p><p>Intel has pledged to build out its manufacturing capacity, earmarking up to $28 billion for 2022 back in October, and recently said it will spend more than $20 billion to build a “mega-site” fab in Ohio, as well as $20 billion for sites in Arizona. The move to build capacity has met with concern from analysts because Intel's spending is punishing the company's gross margins.</p>",
