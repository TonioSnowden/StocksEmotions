  "title": "Earnings  Reports  To Test  Rally  ----  By Karen Langley",
  "text": "<p>   Companies reporting results in coming weeks are under heightened pressure to spell out how their performance in 2021 is likely to justify share-price gains notched during an epic stock-market rally. </p><p>   A first round of big-bank results late last week highlighted the challenge. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported a record quarterly profit and there were bright spots at Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Still, shares of all three declined, with Wells and Citigroup each dropping more than 6%. </p><p>   Corporate executives face rising investor expectations going into the fourth-quarter earnings season that the economic outlook would soon brighten despite an accelerating toll from the coronavirus. Bank shares had climbed more than 10% for 2021 heading into Friday's trading. </p><p>   \"Whether they had a good quarter or not, it's all about what's next,\" said Kimberly Woody, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, which manages $1.9 billion. \"Good future news has been priced into this market.\" </p><p>   That is a big change from recent months. During the S&amp;P 500's roughly 70% rise from last March's intraday low, investors had deemed soft earnings acceptable. That was because they expect a sharp rebound this year -- and had priced shares accordingly. </p><p>   Companies whose projections fall short can expect to be punished, analysts said. </p><p>   Valuations show how investors have raised the bar for companies. Members of the S&amp;P 500 traded last Thursday at 22.65 times their projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. </p><p>   That is above a five-year average of 17.84 times. And it is even though analysts estimate profits for companies in the benchmark index fell 13% for 2020 as a whole, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Dozens of big companies are scheduled to report this week, including transportation firm J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., health-care giant UnitedHealth Group Inc., oil-field services company Halliburton Co. and semiconductor maker Intel Corp. </p><p>   Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are projected to have fallen 6.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, a sharp improvement from the second quarter's 32% collapse but not the kind of performance that typically inspires stock-market records. Profit estimates have crept higher since the quarter began, and some investors expect the current forecasts are a low bar that companies will clear. </p><p>   Purchasers of stocks are counting on more than a year's worth of earnings, and many investors say the market has advanced despite the damage of 2020 because of a widely held belief that vaccines will help put the pandemic in the past, allowing business to recover. </p><p>   That is despite troubling signs about how the pandemic has recently weighed on the economy: Employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, ending seven months of job growth, and U.S. retail sales fell in December for a third consecutive month. </p><p>   Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to return to year-over-year growth in the first quarter, rising 17%, and then to climb 46% in the second quarter. And economists have raised their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in light of vaccinations and the potential for additional aid from Washington for households and businesses. </p><p></p>",
