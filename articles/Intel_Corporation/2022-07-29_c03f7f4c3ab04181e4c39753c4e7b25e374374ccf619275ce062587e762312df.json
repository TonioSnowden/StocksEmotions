  "title": "Technology:  Intel Logs  Loss, Cuts  Forecast as  Sales Fall  ----  By Asa Fitch",
  "text": "<p>   Chip maker Intel Corp. reported a surprise quarterly loss and cut its full-year outlook, reflecting a slump in personal-computer purchases and product delays. </p><p>   Intel on Thursday said sales in the second quarter fell 22% to $15.3 billion, its biggest revenue drop in more than a decade. The company blamed a rapid decline in economic activity as it forecast a 10% decline in overall PC sales this year. </p><p>   Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said delays in the rollout of a new chip family for data centers and continued supply-chain troubles compounded the PC weakness. </p><p>   The results were \"below our expectations, below what we committed to our shareholders,\" he said, adding \"we're quite disappointed by that.\" </p><p>   The semiconductor titan had a net loss of $454 million. </p><p>   Higher interest rates and inflation have hit consumers' pocketbooks around the world, and the return to in-person work has softened demand for PCs that people bought in droves over the past two years to facilitate remote work and distance schooling. </p><p>   The division that houses Intel's PC chips reported a 25% fall in revenue to $7.7 billion, and sales at its data-center-chip division fell 16% to $4.6 billion. </p><p>   PC customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in a decade, Mr. Gelsinger said in a call with analysts. PC makers typically reduce inventory levels of chips when they are expecting lower sales. </p><p>   The chip maker said revenue in the current quarter should be $15 billion to $16 billion. Wall Street had been expecting sales of more than $18 billion. For the full year, Intel now expects sales of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from $76 billion. </p><p>   Mr. Gelsinger said the sharp fall in consumer appetite would probably ease the global chip shortage that has persisted for two years. </p><p></p>",
