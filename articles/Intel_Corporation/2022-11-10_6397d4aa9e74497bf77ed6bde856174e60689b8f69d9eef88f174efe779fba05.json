  "title": "Brookfield Seeks to Expand Role as Capital Provider to Large Companies; The firm has collected $33 billion in investment capital since June as it looks for more deals like its Intel financing agreement",
  "text": "<p>Brookfield executives reviewed some of the details of the Intel deal Thursday during an earnings conference call with analysts. In August, Brookfield agreed to fund 49% of the expected $30 billion cost of expanding Intel's semiconductor operations in Chandler, Ariz., with the company covering the rest.</p><p>\"This is just one chip manufacturing facility and the trends towards deglobalization may result in similar opportunities going forward,\" Brookfield Chief Executive Bruce Flatt said on the call.</p><p>Brookfield's global presence, available capital and operating expertise also make the firm an attractive partner for companies seeking to expand as market volatility makes deal financing more difficult, Mr. Flatt said. As an example, he cited Brookfield's recent acquisition, along with infrastructure-focused DigitalBridge Group Inc., of a 51% stake in Deutsche Telekom AG's telecommunications tower business for roughly â‚¬6.6 billion, or about $6.61 billion.</p><p>\"Our recently announced partnerships are hopefully only the beginning of what we want to accomplish,\" Mr. Flatt said, referring to investments such as the Deutsche Telekom and Intel deals.</p><p>Brookfield ended the third quarter with about $125 billion in deployable capital, including $88 billion of uncalled fund commitments, or \"dry powder,\" to invest across all its strategies. In total, the firm manages $762 billion across real estate, infrastructure, clean-energy, private-equity and credit strategies</p><p>The firm said it had raised roughly $21 billion for its fifth flagship infrastructure fund and $8.4 billion for its sixth main private-equity fund. Brookfield also said it has raised $2.8 billion so far for a new infrastructure-debt fund and $1 billion for a supercore-infrastructure vehicle focused on low-risk assets, among other ongoing fundraising efforts.</p><p>\"We remain on track to deliver our best fundraising year ever,\" Nicholas Goodman, the firm's chief financial officer, said on the call.</p><p>Brookfield's third-quarter net income plunged 74% to $716 million, or 24 cents per share, while revenue climbed nearly 22% to $2.42 billion, compared with a year ago. The drop in net earnings reflected a decrease in asset valuations as well as higher interest payments, according to the firm.</p><p>Brookfield posted a 9.7% increase in distributable earnings to $1.36 billion for the period compared with the same quarter a year ago. Fee-related earnings rose 18% to $531 million.</p><p>Mr. Flatt also updated the firm's progress on a plan to split itself into two separate entities, creating Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. as a separate publicly traded business. After shareholders approved the move in a meeting on Wednesday, Brookfield expects to complete the separation before the end of this year, Mr. Flatt said.</p><p>The plan calls for Brookfield to spin off 25% of shares in its asset-management businesses to investors while retaining the remaining interest and includes a distribution of $20 billion to shareholders. The separated entity will manage the firm's assets.</p><p>Brookfield's stock jumped 8.6% Thursday to close at 59.56 Canadian dollars per share in Toronto.</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
