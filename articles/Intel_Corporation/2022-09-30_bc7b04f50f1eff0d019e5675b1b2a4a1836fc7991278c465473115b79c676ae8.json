  "title": "Intel files for Mobileye IPO, creating a share structure that will keep the chipmaker in control; Automotive-tech business files for offering with annual revenue of more than $1 billion",
  "text": "<p>Intel executiveswere targeting mid-2022 as of late last year, and filed confidentially with the SEC in March for the IPO of its self-driving-car unit, but the IPO market has been dry amid a decline for stocks, especially those that went public in a 2021 rush.</p><p>Mobileye plans to trade Class A shares of common stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol \"MBLY,\" the same symbol the company had before Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion in cash. While selling shares in Mobileye, Intel will retain official control of the company, keeping class B shares that carry 10 votes apiece while selling class A shares that have only one vote.</p><p>Mobileye also plans to have four Intel-affiliated members on its board, including Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger serving as chairman of Mobileye's board.</p><p>Intel will also get paid from the offering: Mobileye issued Intel a dividend note for $3.5 billion, and expects to pay that off with proceeds from the sale, according to the filing; there was an initial payment of $336 million, leaving more than $3 billion still owed to Intel. Earlier reporting suggested Intel would seek a $30 billion valuation for Mobileye in the IPO, though the initial filing Friday did not include targeted prices for the shares.</p><p>The filing did include financial information, though: Mobileye reported revenue of $1.39 billion in 2021, well ahead of Nvidia Corp. NVDA, which reported fiscal-year revenue of $566 million in auto chip sales in January. Mobileye reported a loss of $70 million last year, compared with a $196 million loss in 2020 and $328 million in 2019. Revenue in the first half of this year hit $854 million, growing 41% in the second quarter from the year before.</p><p>The filing lists a whopping 24 underwriters for the deal including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Evercore ISI, Barclays, Citigroup, and B of A Securities.</p><p>Shares of Intel were up 0.5% after hours Friday, following a 2.3% decline in the regular session to close at $25.77.</p><p>Intel files for Mobileye IPO, creating a share structure that will keep the chipmaker in control</p>",
