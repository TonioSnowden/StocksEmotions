  "title": "Micron Shares Slump on Muted Sales Forecast; Memory-chip maker feels the pinch from consumer-spending weakness after two red-hot years",
  "text": "<p>Micron, which makes data-storage and memory chips for computers and smartphones, had enjoyed a major upswing in sales and profit during the pandemic, benefiting from surging demand for electronics amid the work-from-home shift. But personal-computer and smartphone sales are on the decline this year, and consumer-spending growth cooled in the U.S. in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p><p>Micron said sales rose 16% to $8.64 billion and its profit grew 51% to $2.63 billion in its latest fiscal quarter. But the company also said it expects sales for its current quarter to be only around $7.2 billion, lower than the $9.15 billion analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated. Earnings per share are expected at around $1.52, also lower than Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>The company's shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading.</p><p>Computing demand has been hit by high inflation, rising interest rates and shakier consumer spending this year, following two red-hot years unlike any period the industry has seen. Tech companies with ties to PCs—Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. among them—have adjusted plansand are slowing some hiring. HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. are grappling with slower sales of low-cost laptops that had boomed during the pandemic.</p><p>Shipments of PCs are expected to fall by 9.5% this year, research firm Gartner Inc. said Thursday, while projecting smartphone shipments to retreat 5.8%.</p><p>In a presentation, Mr. Mehrotra said Micron was expecting more-muted supply in memory capacity and that it would use existing inventory to satisfy some coming market demand. As a result, the company also expects to reduce its spending plan on chip-making capacity expansion for the next fiscal year, he said, which will now decline from this year's level.</p><p>Mr. Mehrotra also said the company faces supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures.</p><p>The company also is seeing signs of strength, though. Mr. Mehrotra said sales of chips to big data centers increased more than 50% in the third fiscal quarter, and revenue from the automotive sector set a record amid a shift toward electric vehicles that need more computing power than their gas-powered counterparts.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>Micron Shares Slump on Muted Sales Forecast</p>",
