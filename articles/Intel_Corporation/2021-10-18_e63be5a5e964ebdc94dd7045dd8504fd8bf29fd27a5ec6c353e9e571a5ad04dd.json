Paradoxically these aerial shows of strength suggest the Chinese may not be serious adversaries.</p> <p>Unless it is flown with extreme professionalism and stealth, a warplane generates electronic signals of use to an enemy. Repeated flights of up to 50 aircraft would generate a startling cornucopia of signals intelligence for any observer. Pressure on Taiwan has the unintended effect of briefing any would-be enemy and their allies with extensive knowledge of the Chinese air force and all its modus operandi.</p> <p>Surely, it would be of more concern if the Chinese did not show their hand in such a comprehensive and revealing way and remained completely passive.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Aylen</strong><br><em>Salford, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: China's Taiwan incursions could be an intel windfall' FT.com 18 October.
