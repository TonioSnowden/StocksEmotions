  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  U.S. Alters Rules for Sharing Intel  ---  White House modifies  guidance for Pentagon,  spy agencies on  sending data to Kyiv  ----  By Warren P. Strobel and Michael R. Gordon",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The White House last week modified existing guidance for the Pentagon and U.S. spy agencies on sending intelligence data to the Ukrainian government to clear the way of any bureaucratic roadblocks to information sharing, a senior Biden administration official said. </p><p>   That change followed complaints from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that President Biden's administration wasn't sharing real-time targeting data that would enable Ukraine's military to strike back at Russian armored formations bombarding and attempting to envelop its major cities. </p><p>   \"We're adjusting as circumstances warrant, and we'll continue to ensure that operators have flexibility to share intelligence as the conflict evolves,\" a U.S. intelligence official said of the change, declining to provide additional details. </p><p>   The U.S. has been sharing battlefield intelligence with Ukraine to help the Kyiv-based government defend itself against Russia's invasion, while being careful to avoid becoming directly embroiled in the conflict itself, other U.S. officials said. </p><p>   The intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which isn't a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is part of broader Biden policy of support for Kyiv that includes billions in military assistance, diplomatic support and joining U.S. allies in harsh sanctions on Russia. </p><p>   It extends a preinvasion initiative of releasing more intelligence than Washington has previously provided to allies in Europe and to the public to spotlight the Kremlin's military movements. </p><p>   In the days leading up to the invasion, the Biden administration warned repeatedly that an attack was imminent, though it didn't provide details on why it believed Russia was preparing military action. According to an American official, one of the reasons the U.S. grew so certain of Moscow's plan for an invasion was intelligence showing the Russian military had begun to fuel its missiles, a sign they were about to be deployed. </p><p>   It couldn't be determined, however, if that specific detail was provided to the Ukrainians. </p><p>   U.S. officials said the classified information now streaming across secure communications portals includes detailed, tactical data on Russian troop movements that is designed to help Ukraine formulate a military response. They declined to be more specific, citing the classified nature of the exchange. </p><p>   One U.S. official said the intelligence data first must be scrubbed to remove clues about how it was collected, leading to delays in sharing it with the Ukrainians. </p><p>   Rep. Adam Smith (D., Wash.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said last week that the Pentagon wasn't sharing \"real-time targeting\" information with the Ukrainians because doing so would make the U.S. a participant in the war. \"So the Pentagon is really struggling and walking that very fine line,\" he said on MSNBC. </p><p>   Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told National Public Radio \"We are sending them intelligence. But we have lawyers delaying the process at way, way too many steps. And we shouldn't be letting technicalities get in the way of helping the Ukrainians fight back.\" </p><p>   U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter disputed those characterizations. They said one of the major impediments to sharing classified material with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government is concerns about Russian moles in Ukraine's security services. </p><p>   \"We are sharing intelligence with Ukrainians as quickly as possible,\" Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a recent TV interview. \"We also have to realize, unfortunately, many of the Ukrainian services have been penetrated by the Russians over many years, so we have to protect our sources and methods.\" </p><p>   Those counterintelligence concerns, officials said, can mean delays in transmitting newly acquired intelligence to Ukraine, while it is sanitized to ensure Russian operatives don't learn the details of American intelligence-gathering methods. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Gordon Lubold and Nancy A.
