  "title": "SK Chief Just Wants Everyone to Be Happy; Chey Tae-won is on a mission to reframe the South Korean conglomerate as a kinder, greener citizen of the world",
  "text": "<p>Many of SK's investments have focused on the U.S., where the company is building two lithium-ion battery factories to serve automotive clients like Ford Motor Co. The company's SK Hynix unit last year reached a roughly $9 billion deal to buy Intel Corp.'s memory-chip business.</p><p>SK has partly outgrown its roots as a chaebol, the term for the family-controlled conglomerates like LG and Samsung that helped drive South Korea's postwar recovery. Launched in 1953 as Sunkyong Textile, SK's sales swelled to 82 trillion won, equivalent to about $69 billion, in 2020 as its business lines diversified. Mr. Chey said investors should now think of the conglomerate as a more global company.</p><p>But SK remains a family business. Mr. Chey is the third member of his family to serve as the group's chairman and continued to oversee the business from prison after a 2013 criminal conviction for misappropriating company funds. He was pardoned in 2015 by South Korea's then-president and returned to the board the next year.</p><p>Under Mr. Chey the Seoul-based group has made \"happiness\" its watchword, seeking a softer edge in a business culture plagued by overwork that some critics consider unproductive. He also introduced the group's corporate logo—which he calls \"wings of happiness\"—to underscore that goal.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts from an interview between Mr. Chey and The Wall Street Journal:</p><p>WSJ: What's the origin story of the SK Management System?</p><p>Mr. Chey: We are really serious about people's happiness. It's not just our employees' happiness but also the stakeholders' happiness. We've been studying what we call social value. We developed a double-bottom line accounting system.</p><p>WSJ: So what is that second bottom line?</p><p>Mr. Chey: Two different things: ESG goals and the contribution to the economy, like how much tax we pay and how much wage we give to society and employees. We don't have the standard yet. Somebody has to come up with the standard for how we can measure this social value.</p><p>WSJ: How did the happiness measurement idea come into being?</p><p>Mr. Chey: Everybody's final purpose is happiness, right? The company you just work for, people really love that they have more money, but that was kind of a part of the happiness. This is our goal. We have to make people happy.</p><p>WSJ: Are there experts in this field that you brought in to help advise you?</p><p>Mr. Chey: That's our biggest challenge actually. We don't have benchmarks, so in this concept, we have to develop our own things. The first time we just surveyed employees about happiness conditions today. The average score is 65 to 70. But some events make the happiness score drop.</p><p>WSJ: What kind of events?</p><p>Mr. Chey: It's various things. The stock dropped. Fires or an accident—negative surprises. But we found that even though there's bad news, if we communicate the right way, that actually has impacted people's happiness score.</p><p>WSJ: With your plans to invest in the U.S., are you building new chip fabrication plants or mostly putting it into research?</p><p>Mr. Chey: We don't have plans yet. We have a so-called precondition study. It's a huge market, but the problem is the workforce and the cost. You do have a lot of software engineers, but you don't have that many technical engineers for the production. So making a fab, it's a whole other challenge.</p><p>WSJ: Your partnership with Ford, is that something that's done at the group level where you met with the heads of that business?</p><p>Mr. Chey: Ford needed some battery-supply partner. This battery business is not just for sale to everybody. The battery has to specify which type of motor it is powering. And so without any contract, we cannot manufacture.</p><p>We've been in this business for almost 20 years. We go for the big ones for the electric vehicle. We put in a lot of money and R&amp;D effort to the battery. It's still losing money. The capex numbers are enormous. Sometimes I'm really scared about those numbers. That's why we have to make some joint venture with the original equipment manufacturer. That's the one way to actually save some capex.</p><p>WSJ: I'm curious how your partnership with Ford came together.</p><p>Mr. Chey: Well, we've been doing business together so many years that I think that both companies have some trust. We didn't actually expect that the market would reward the investment, but things just go \"boom,\" and then everybody wants to have the electric vehicle.</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>SK Chief Just Wants Everyone to Be Happy</p>",
