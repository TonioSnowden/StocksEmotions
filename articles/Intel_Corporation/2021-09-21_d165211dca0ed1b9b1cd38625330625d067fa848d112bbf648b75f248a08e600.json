  "text": "<p>Chief information officers who helped spearhead their companies' digital transformations during the Covid-19 pandemic are now preparing for the next wave: A world of in-office, remote and hybrid work.</p><p>To succeed in this new world, technology executives are partnering with talent-facing leaders, including chief people officers, to ensure that not just the technology is in place but also the policies and procedures for an inclusive and immersive work environment for those who continue to work remotely either part or full time, according to a panel of CIOs speaking Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's CIO Network summit.</p><p>\"What was most interesting to me is that during the pandemic, CIOs had to partner much more with the chief people officers than we had in the past, because culture mattered and hybrid management of employees mattered,\" said Adam Stanley, CIO and chief digital officer at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, one of the world's largest commercial real-estate firms. </p><p>Peloton CIO Shobhana Ahluwalia during the CIO Network Summit. PHOTO: The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Stanley said CIOs during the pandemic found themselves having more strategic conversations with management and being asked to gauge the impact that remote and hybrid work was having on employees.</p><p>\"Suddenly, we were being asked questions around things like: How much were managers talking to their employees? And how much interaction were we seeing? And how do you measure productivity of people working at home?\" Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>And those questions aren't going to go away. Intel Corp. has recognized that today's workforce is never fully going back to the office and that it needs to accommodate the different types of work people are doing and from where and when they are doing it, said Archana Deskus, the chip maker's CIO.</p><p>CIOs need to ensure that employees working remotely have the same immersive experience during, say, a virtual white-boarding session, as those in the office, Ms. Deskus said. And the solutions involve more than just technology.</p><p>\"It's about the culture change,\" said Shobhana Ahluwalia, CIO at exercise equipment maker Peloton Interactive Inc. Forward-thinking companies have their CIOs and human resources teams creating the policies and training programs to support hybrid environments as well as deploying the technology that makes it easy for people to work wherever they are, she said.</p><p>In many ways maintaining digital-transformation momentum comes down to technology leaders being better business leaders and anticipating the needs of the whole organization. \"You have to really think about all of those interactions that you do. And re-architect your processes, re-architect the way you work together. And really think about what it would mean if someone is permanently remote,\" Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>Write to John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.com</p><p>CIOs Seek Partners in Hybrid Workplace Push</p>",
