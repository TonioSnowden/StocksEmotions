  "title": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's Re-Election Overcame Attacks From Democrats and Trump; 'Reports of my political death,' governor says, were 'greatly exaggerated'",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Kemp defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by a larger margin than in their first contest in 2018. In May, Mr. Kemp trounced a Trump-backed challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, in a primary vote. Two years ago, political observers declared his career over after Mr. Trump lost to President Biden in Georgia and Mr. Kemp was accused by the former president of not doing enough to reverse that outcome—even though he had no legal means to do so.</p><p>Mr. Kemp told supporters at his victory party Tuesday night, \"It looks like the reports of my political death have been greatly exaggerated.\"</p><p>Election Updates</p><p>* Live Results</p><p>* Latest News</p><p>* How Different Groups Voted</p><p>Mr. Kemp, 59, not only won his race, it appears every other statewide Republican candidate rode to victory on his coattails, with one notable exception: Senate candidate Herschel Walker. Mr. Trump endorsed the former football player who Wednesday was headed for a December runoff against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.</p><p>\"Being a good Christian, I believe in resurrection,\" said Rusty Paul, the former longtime chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. \"And I think that's what we just saw here.\"</p><p>Four years ago, Mr. Kemp won by about 55,000 votes out of about 3.9 million cast in an acrimonious contest with Ms. Abrams, who never formally conceded but acknowledged days after the election that Mr. Kemp would become governor. She accused Mr. Kemp of suppressing minority votes and later a voting-rights group she founded filed a federal lawsuit on those grounds. A federal judge ruled against the suit's claims this year.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Kemp won by about 300,000 votes out of 3.9 million cast, according to the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, which oversees elections. Ms. Abrams contacted him to concede before the Associated Press called the race. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Mr. Kemp said he appreciated her call, which he described as \"very cordial, very short.\"</p><p>In November 2020, Mr. Trump lost Georgia by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast, a defeat he rejected, claiming fraud. Recounts, investigations and court challenges found no widespread fraud, but Mr. Trump and his supporters pressed Mr. Kemp and other state officials to overturn the results. Mr. Kemp didn't do so.</p><p>Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Kemp, a onetime ally, tweeting that he \"should resign from office. He's an obstructionist who refuses to admit we won Georgia, BIG!\" Mr. Trump then backed Mr. Perdue to unseat Mr. Kemp, an effort that failed. On Wednesday, Mr. Kemp said Mr. Trump had not called him to congratulate him.</p><p>\"I haven't heard from him,\" he said.</p><p>Republican state Sen. Larry Walker III, a Kemp supporter, said he was impressed with the governor's \"intestinal fortitude to withstand all the withering attacks\" from both Democrats and pro-Trump Republicans.</p><p>Throughout his campaign, Mr. Kemp focused on criticizing Ms. Abrams and President Biden, whom he blamed for high inflation. He never attacked Mr. Trump but blasted Mr. Perdue and other critics in the state.</p><p>He stressed on the campaign trail that Georgia's economy thrived even during much of the pandemic, in part because of his decision—criticized by Ms. Abrams, Mr. Trump and others at the time—to allow businesses to reopen after Covid-19 lockdowns much earlier than other states. He also focused on issues like combating crime and reopening schools. He supported several key positions popular with conservatives, including expanding gun rights, restricting abortion and limiting what he described as divisive ideologies he said were being taught in some schools.</p><p>\"They have run a pitch-perfect, textbook campaign,\" said Kevin McLaughlin, former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mr. Kemp's decision to avoid publicly criticizing Mr. Trump disarmed many pro-Trump voters over time. His attacks on Ms. Abrams and President Biden also helped, Mr. McLaughlin said.</p><p>\"His public posturing on Trump is great. He's not acrimonious with him—he's like, 'I like Trump, I just disagree with him on this,'\" Mr. McLaughlin added.</p><p>Ms. Abrams's narrow loss in 2018, the closest a Democratic gubernatorial candidate had come to winning in the state in years, stemmed in part from an extensive get-out-the-vote effort in Democratic areas of the state. After that race, Mr. Kemp's campaign team sought to replicate that with a similar effort in GOP areas, such as Atlanta's outer suburbs and rural parts of the state.</p><p>How People Voted</p><p>Results of survey of about 115,000 registered voters</p><p>\"Their ground intel in Georgia was incredible,\" said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and former chief of staff to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). \"It's the best governor's campaign in the country, and they've been flawless in their execution…. Most people had assumed that Kemp was going to be in a really tough spot getting through a primary in that campaign, and people thought this was going to be a dogfight in the general.\"</p><p>Seth Clark, a Democratic activist who has helped run several statewide campaigns in Georgia, said Ms. Abrams's loss was \"incredibly predictable,\" because her campaign focused on raising money around the country instead of trying to reach real Georgia residents and address their concerns.</p><p>\"This is what we were worried about,\" said Mr. Clark, who is mayor pro tem of Macon-Bibb County, a Democratic-led area south of Atlanta. \"Good fundraising does not always equal\" victory.</p><p>\"A lot of people wrote me off,\" Mr. Kemp said, adding he \"focused on the support of the people who could vote for me,\" ranging from Mr. Trump's supporters to minority voters who didn't normally vote Republican.</p><p>\"There was a certain wing of the party that was mad at me, but they also had been lied to,\" he said.</p><p>Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com</p><p>Georgia Gov.
