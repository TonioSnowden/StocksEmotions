  "text": "<p>   Intel was the biggest early investor in EUV, committing more than $4 billion to it in 2012. But it was slower than its main rivals in adopting the technology, and skeptical about whether it would work. Eventually, Intel calculated it was a surer bet to try to improve existing ways of handling lithography. </p><p>   TSMC worked with ASML Holding NV, the only company now able to produce machines that etch chips with EUV lithography, and vaulted ahead. Peter Wennink, the Dutch company's chief executive, said that Mr. Chang took TSMC all-in on their partnership about five years ago with just a few words over tea in his Taiwan office. Mr. Chang retired in 2018. </p><p>   With EUV, TSMC became one of two companies, with Samsung, to make the most advanced chips with the smallest transistors possible, used in the world's top smartphones. </p><p>   Intel is accelerating a shift toward EUV under its new CEO, Pat Gelsinger. </p><p>   As TSMC became more dominant, it grew harder to maintain its role as a neutral party in the industry, especially as tensions rose between the U.S. and China, two of its most important markets. </p><p>   In response to growing U.S. pressure on China, TSMC suspended orders from Huawei Technologies Co., once its largest Chinese customer, last year and committed to building a $12 billion factory in Arizona. The Trump administration promised to help secure $3 billion in incentives, according to two people familiar with the situation, but funding hasn't been allocated so far. </p><p>   While TSMC's Arizona factory will help increase chip production on U.S. soil, it won't catapult the U.S. to the technological edge. The factory is expected to produce what's known as 5-nanometer technology chips by the time it's running in 2024. At that point, the cutting edge is projected to be 3-nanometer technology. Those chips will be made by TSMC in Taiwan. </p><p>   With microcontrollers for auto makers, TSMC has been privately frustrated by the industry's insistence that it give priority to its orders, people familiar with the matter said. Auto makers curtailed their own orders last year as the pandemic started. By the time demand snapped back, TSMC had committed capacity elsewhere. </p><p>   Analysts say TSMC has little incentive to reallocate production. The less lucrative auto chips make up only around 4% of its revenues. </p><p>   As German auto makers began furloughing workers and slashing production late last year with chip shortages deepening, they lobbied the German government to pressure Taiwan. Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, wrote a letter to Taiwanese officials urging them to ensure TSMC expanded supply and warning that the chip shortage could derail the global economic recovery. </p><p>   Mr. Altmaier recently told a meeting of foreign correspondents in Berlin that talks were continuing, but declined to share details. </p><p>   In May, luxury car maker Audi furloughed around 10,000 workers as it idled production of some of its bestselling models at two factories. </p><p>   Dimitris Dotis, the Audi brand specialist at Audi Tysons Corner dealership in Virginia, summed up the situation to customers. \"Almost all microchips that go into all new vehicles including Audi come from TSMC in Taiwan,\" he wrote. \"They expect bottlenecks in the supply chain to last through 2022.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   William Boston, Bojan Pancevski and Ben Foldy contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
