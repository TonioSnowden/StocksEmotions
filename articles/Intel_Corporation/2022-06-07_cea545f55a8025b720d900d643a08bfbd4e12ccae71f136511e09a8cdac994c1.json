  "text": "<p>WSJ: What is the aim of the new law?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: The idea is working with the private sector, identifying key stakeholders in this space, we would create a safe space at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency where the agency and the companies would work together in real time as they address these incidents.</p><p>That was important for a number of reasons. We wanted to be able to look at case studies of how bad actors were actually infiltrating information networks. We wanted to get a sense of how we could use our expertise to thwart future incidents. And we wanted to back away from the knee-jerk reaction of actually paying ransoms.</p><p>WSJ: The FBI and Justice Department have both said they oppose this law because, in their view, it could damage their ability to conduct investigations. DOJ and CISA have somewhat different mandates, different motivations. DOJ is an investigative agency whereas CISA's mandate is to protect critical infrastructure. How do you respond to those concerns?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: The Biden administration has called for an all-of-government response to the cyber incidents that threaten our national security, that threaten our business sector, that threaten the livelihoods of most Americans. CISA has done what they need to do, the government is doing what they need to do, to really drive down private-sector risks that pose a risk to all of us. We don't necessarily agree on language, but that doesn't mean that we can't address conflicts if they arise. </p><p>Rep. Yvette Clarke says 'the government is doing what they need to do, to really drive down private-sector risks.' PHOTO: The Wall Street Journal</p><p>WSJ: Other agencies have rolled out rules and proposed regulations mandating reporting regimes of their own. Last year, the TSA proposed rules regarding pipelines and railways to report significant cyber incidents. This year, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed rules about publicly traded companies reporting material incidents to that agency. Do we need all of these independent reporting structures?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: The Biden administration is looking for a whole-of-government approach. However, it's going to be really important that each of our federal agencies see CISA as the lead agency and work very closely with them. CISA has the authorities to really take the lead in this space.</p><p>WSJ: Since you head the subcommittee that provides oversight of CISA, the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Innovation Subcommittee, how do you see the agency's future?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: I and my colleagues see CISA growing from strength to strength as we become engaged with critical infrastructure and emerging technologies. They have to build the workforce, they have to build the expertise to manage a growing portfolio of means by which we protect the homeland, infrastructure, the communities we all reside in. CISA will manage a $1 billion grant program that will help municipalities, localities and states stand up a more robust cybersecurity posture and infrastructure.</p><p>There's a lot of competition out there for the expertise that is required both in the private sector and in the public sector. So, building a cybersecurity workforce is something that we know is really important. Government can in no way, shape or form compensate the workforce to the same level as the private sector. But we need to be able to make sure that we have all eyes on what's taking place in the ever-expanding world of cyber.</p><p>WSJ: What's on your legislative wish list?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: We've got a pretty robust foundation. However, there are so many other spaces in which we have to have eyes and situational awareness, whether that is industrial control or operational technology, quantum computing, emerging technologies in that space, or election systems and disinformation. We intend to have a number of hearings this month to really drill down and get more intel on how we can provide CISA with the authorities it needs to address all of those areas that remain vulnerable.</p><p>AUDIENCE QUESTION: What do you think about sharing intelligence gathered from disclosures back to the private sector after removing identifying attributes to help the private sector defend itself better?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: CISA will be a great repository of best practices, of case studies. It's important that it's a two-way street, that we're able to get information about incidents and disseminate it to the various sectors so that they can defend the private sectors where most of our infrastructure and our IT is located. Without their knowledge and cooperation and collaboration, there's a gap. And that's where the bad actors will flourish. So, that's absolutely an imperative.</p><p>Write to reports@wsj.com</p><p>How Congress Can Help Prevent Cyberattacks</p>",
