  "title": "Democrats Press Message of Abortion Access in Tight Gubernatorial Races; Republican candidates in some states say they welcome the chance to push for tighter restrictions if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade",
  "text": "<p>The drive is coming largely from Democrats in states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, and in the mid-Atlantic state of Pennsylvania. They are pitching themselves as a last line of defense against Republican state lawmakers if Roe v. Wade is overturned and issues surrounding abortion rights and restrictions are effectively kicked to the states to resolve. Democratic candidates view abortion rights as a potential galvanizing issue at a moment when other forces are producing headwinds.</p><p>Republican candidates throughout the region have said they welcome the chance to restrict abortion if the high court overturns Roe v. Wade, which has appeared possible since a draft opinion of such a decision was leaked in May. Republicans in states including Ohio have been preparing new measures to restrict abortion in anticipation of a high-court ruling.</p><p>\"Roe is on the ballot,\" Nan Whaley, the Democratic candidate for governor of Ohio, said to a room full of women at a wine bar in the affluent Hyde Park neighborhood of Cincinnati during a recent campaign event. \"This has now become a voting issue, not just a court issue anymore.\"</p><p>Republicans in races across the country largely have strong support heading into election season, and they stand to benefit from voter frustration over inflation and high gas prices, according to recent polling.</p><p>At the same time, polls have shown that many Midwest voters support abortion rights. A 2020 poll by Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, found that more than half of some 4,000 likely voters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin believed that abortion should be always or mostly legal, compared with about 36% in each state who said it should be always or mostly illegal.</p><p>Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace who conducted the poll, said abortion gives Democrats an opportunity to win votes among suburban and rural women who typically vote Republican but believe abortion should be legal.</p><p>Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have Republican primaries in August to decide who will challenge each state's Democratic incumbent. All three incumbents are already highlighting that abortion rights could be at stake in November.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think abortion rights will influence voters in coming elections? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"When I said I'd fight like hell for abortion rights, I meant it,\" said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, after filing a lawsuit challenging a 1931 law banning abortion that could be revived if Roe v. Wade falls. Ms. Whitmer also directed state officials not to cooperate with other states seeking to prosecute women for seeking an abortion if Roe is overturned.</p><p>At a debate in May, Republican contenders looking to challenge Gov. Whitmer, a Democrat, said they supported banning abortion. Some said there should be exceptions for rape or incest.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, has called abortion his top campaign issue.</p><p>The Republican candidate, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a retired Army colonel, has said he would sign a bill to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which he introduced to the state legislature, and stop state funding to Planned Parenthood.</p><p>\"There is no greater issue in our generation than a right to life,\" Mr. Mastriano says in a video posted to his campaign website.</p><p>A Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll of 792 registered voters in April found that 14% of Pennsylvania voters said abortion should be illegal under any circumstances, compared with 31% who said it should be legal under any circumstances. Some 54% said it should be legal under certain circumstances.</p><p>In Ohio, abortion is the second-most important issue for voters in the Ohio governor's race, behind the economy, according to the results of a poll released Tuesday by Suffolk University and the Cincinnati Enquirer. Fifty-three percent of some 500 likely voters surveyed for the poll said they want the Ohio legislature to protect abortion rights.</p><p>Ms. Whaley, the former mayor of Dayton, is trailing Republican Gov. Mike DeWine by 15 points, according to the poll. Nearly a third of voters surveyed said they didn't know who she is.</p><p>On the campaign trail, abortion rights have become a significant talking point for Ms. Whaley. At the Cincinnati campaign event, she reminded attendees that Gov. DeWine supports a bill to make abortion illegal without exceptions for rape or incest, and that he previously signed another measure to ban abortion after six weeks. That law has been stayed by a federal judge in Cincinnati who said it violated women's constitutional rights.</p><p>Gov. DeWine, meanwhile, is known across the state from his long career in Ohio politics, and he has a big fundraising edge. He is primarily campaigning on the state's strong economy and touting projects like Intel Corp.'s plan to build a $20 billion chip-manufacturing plant outside Columbus.</p><p>He has said he would sign a Republican-backed bill introduced this year that would ban abortions without exceptions for rape or incest. The bill would allow doctors to defend themselves from criminal charges if they performed an abortion to prevent the death or serious injury of the pregnant person. If passed, the bill would take effect if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Mr. DeWine's campaign, said Ms. Whaley's longtime support for abortion rights wasn't in line with the majority of Ohio voters. \"She's far more left and extreme on a plethora of issues,\" Ms. McLaughlin said.</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com</p><p>Democrats Press Message of Abortion Access in Tight Gubernatorial Races</p>",
