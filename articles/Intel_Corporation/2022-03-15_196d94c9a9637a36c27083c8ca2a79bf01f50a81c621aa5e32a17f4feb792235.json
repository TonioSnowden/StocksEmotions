  "title": "AI Chip Startups Pull In Funding as They Navigate Supply Constraints; Companies secured an estimated $9.9 billion in venture capital last year, triple the total funding in 2020",
  "text": "<p>Together, these startups secured an estimated $9.9 billion in venture capital across 170 deals last year, more than triple the total funding for AI chip startups in 2020, according to market-research firm PitchBook Data Inc. They include global startups building AI chips, intelligent sensors and devices, and algorithms designed to optimize AI and machine-learning models, the firm said.</p><p>Gartner Inc. said more than 50 companies are making chips specifically for AI. It expects sales of chips designed to execute AI tasks to reach $44.3 billion this year and $76.8 billion by 2025.</p><p>For now, most AI chip startups are running on investor capital, rather than sales, and as such are shielded from broader market forces, said Shane Rau, research vice president for computing semiconductors at International Data Corp.</p><p>While the use of AI across the board is growing fast—from virtual assistants to warehouse robots—many of these applications continue to use the same general-purpose chips found in everyday computer electronics. Beyond that, much of the AI market is dominated by graphics processors, originally designed for gaming.</p><p>The performance of purpose-built AI chips is a big improvement over graphics chips in terms of the speed and number of calculations they can execute, said Andrew Feldman, chief executive and co-founder of AI chip maker Cerebras Systems Inc.—whose latest chip, the WSE-2, covers the entire surface of an eight-inch silicon wafer.</p><p>Cerebras says the WSE-2 is more than 50 times larger and contains 2.55 trillion more transistors than the second-largest chip on the market, significantly increasing performance. \"This type of gain is extraordinarily rare in the computer industry, where gains are generally measured in a few percentages,\" Mr. Feldman said.</p><p>\"It's not just the sector itself, it's the ideas and people behind the best AI chip startups that make this appealing,\" said Dave Munichiello, general partner at Alphabet Inc.'s venture-capital arm GV, formerly Google Ventures.</p><p>Mr. Munichiello led GV's 2018 investment in four-year-old AI chip maker SambaNova Systems Inc.</p><p>Semiconductor giants like Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are racing to catch up with a surge in demand for semiconductors of all kinds during the Covid-19 pandemic. All told, global chip sales rose 25% last year from 2020 to a record $583.5 billion, according to research firm Gartner.</p><p>Coupled with ongoing global supply-chain disruptions—which were compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine—most large chip makers are now working through production backlogs that may take years to clear, industry leaders say.</p><p>AI chip startups tend to deal with a smaller customer base and more predictable demand. As such, they were able to gather stores of supplies ahead of raw-material shortages, without the need to secure the massive quantities required by their bigger rivals.</p><p>That advanced sourcing includes substrates—the housing on which the circuitry of chips sit—which are in especially short supply, \"and therefore costly,\" said David Yoffie, a former member of Intel's board of directors who teaches at Harvard Business School. The price of silicon wafers used to make semiconductors is also rising, with costs projected to jump this year between 5% to 15% on average, depending on chip type, according to Dale Gai, a Taiwan-based research director for semiconductors at Counterpoint Research, a tech-market researcher.</p><p>\"Substrates have been a problem very recently, but we secured supply very early and have stock in house,\" said Rodrigo Liang, SambaNova's co-founder and chief executive.</p><p>SambaNova, based in Palo Alto, Calif., counts GV and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 as investors. In November, the company built a supercomputer system for Budapest's OTP Bank. The system runs on chips designed to handle advanced AI-powered language models trained to automate banking services for Hungarian speakers.</p><p>Still, backlogs at larger chip manufacturers can result in capacity constraints for smaller firms, which rely on production time at contract semiconductor foundries to assemble their chips, said Brendan Burke, a senior analyst at PitchBook. Foundries tend to give preferential treatment to large incumbent chip designers, even delaying or canceling orders from smaller firms when times get tight, Mr. Burke said.</p><p>Adrian Mendes, chief operating officer at AI chip startup Groq Inc., said lead times at semiconductor foundries are currently being pushed out to eight to 12 months, more than twice as long as in spring 2021. Groq, founded in 2016, makes chips for software applications in the financial-services sector, for data centers and for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>To cope, Mr. Mendes said the Mountain View, Calif., company has started placing orders for delivery in 2023. \"It's never a situation where you can't get capacity,\" he said. \"We simply need to predict demand and products well in advance. If we get our orders in, they deliver.\"</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p><p>AI Chip Startups Pull In Funding as They Navigate Supply Constraints</p>",
