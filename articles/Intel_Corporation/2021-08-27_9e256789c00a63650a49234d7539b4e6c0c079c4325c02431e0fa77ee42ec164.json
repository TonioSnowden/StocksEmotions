  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>A UK local council provided one of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ed2c2ee-c13a-4758-9c80-37fcb87665b4\">largest-ever loans</a> of more than £150m to the billionaire founder of online retailer <strong>THG</strong>, <strong>Matt Moulding</strong>, after he purchased a swath of the group's properties ahead of its £5bn stock market flotation.</p> <h2>Digital media dealmaking makes the front page</h2> <p>Six years ago, the German publishing group <strong>Axel Springer</strong> lost out on a deal to buy the Financial Times from<strong> Pearson</strong>, its owner of 58 years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e95338-3127-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d\">it was beaten</a> by Japanese media group <strong>Nikkei</strong>, Axel Springer's bid for the FT signalled an important shift in its strategy: to expand its international presence in the English language market.&#xa0;</p> <p>The publisher of Germany's <strong>Die Welt</strong> and<strong> Bild </strong>has made big moves in English media since then.</p> <p>That same year, it paid $343m for digital media group <strong>Business Insider</strong>. A year later it opened an office in New York to make a series of venture capital-like bets on a variety of up-and-coming social media-friendly properties, including <a href=\"https://www.axelspringer.com/en/press-releases/axel-springer-expands-us-presence-with-establishment-of-headquarters-in-new-york-city\">minority interests</a> in <strong>Thrillist</strong> and <strong>NowThis</strong>. More recently it also took a controlling stake in newsletter start-up <strong>Morning Brew</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Thursday Axel Springer placed its biggest bet since it failed to win over “the pink ‘un” as it announced the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d28eda6-ef5c-4326-ad0d-7b20f26b9132\">takeover</a> of Washington-based news site <strong>Politico</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The companies didn't disclose the terms of the deal, but two people familiar with the transaction told DD's Ortenca Aliaj and Kaye Wiggins it was valued at a staggering more than $1bn — an impressive valuation for a news outlet started less than 15 years ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rationale: big-name media assets don't come up for sale all that often, so it's worth paying up for them when they do. Axel Springer will be hoping for synergies and cost savings that will make it worthwhile.&#xa0;</p> <p>Already in a 50/50 venture with Politico for a Europe-focused version of its website, Axel Springer will also gain the remaining 50 per cent of Politico Europe as well as the technology news site <strong>Protocol</strong>.</p> <p>This might make it more difficult for Axel Springer to go after <strong>Axios</strong>, one of the businesses chief executive<strong> Mathias Döpfner</strong> had his eye on, which was launched by a group of former Politico journalists.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Much of the firepower behind the Berlin-based group's dealmaking comes from US private equity group <strong>KKR</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72981ca4-8cd5-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972\">became its largest shareholder</a> in June 2019. The company's subsequent decision to delist has allowed the group to accelerate investments in digital media <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8e6f706-8d16-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972\">without scrutiny from shareholders</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>As Axel Springer shook hands on Thursday, another media group was making a deal of its own. <strong>Forbes </strong>agreed to go public via a merger with <strong>Magnum Opus Acquisition</strong>, a special purpose acquisition company run by a former portfolio manager at <strong>Steve Cohen</strong>'s <strong>Point72 Asset Management</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal, which values Forbes at $630m, will see the company go public more than a century after it published its first magazine in 1917.</p> <p>It follows similar announcements by <strong>BuzzFeed</strong>, which recently agreed to go public via a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13d2013f-e872-4311-a4b8-cfeafedcc413\">Spac deal</a> at a $1.5bn valuation. Other digital media groups, including <strong>Vice</strong>, have also been considering a Spac route to public markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>For years, troubled digital media companies were reluctant to make the first move in what was likely to be a chain of deals. It's now clear that the digital media M&amp;A dance is in full swing, and we should expect more roll-ups as nobody wants to be the last one standing alone.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The $54bn takeover facing obstacles on three continents&#xa0;</h2> <p>When it rains, it pours.&#xa0;</p> <p>US chipmaker <strong>Nvidia</strong> has been busy trying to convince regulators in the UK that its planned $54bn acquisition of British chipmaker <strong>Arm</strong> isn't anti-competitive, but they're having none of it.</p> <p>In fact, the UK's <strong>Competition and Markets Authority</strong> raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6033ee95-96cd-4c5b-b84a-196bf573f5a7\">“serious competition concerns”</a> over the deal, as Nvidia tries to convince regulators around the world, including in China and the US.</p> <p>Brussels has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/08fac465-71bf-4f9e-8ee0-11dd37943326\">emerged as the latest battlefront</a>. Nvidia is set to file the deal as early as September 6, once EU officials return from their summer breaks, people familiar with the move tell DD's Javier Espinoza and the FT's Kate Beioley.</p> <p>After the company notifies it of the transaction, the EU has 25 working days to figure out whether it merits a deeper probe.</p> <p>It won't be an easy fight. The EU is likely to open an in-depth investigation into concerns that the transaction stifles innovation and harms rivals.</p> <p>But even if the US company can win the hearts and minds of EU competition authorities, it will still have to get past multiple hurdles in the UK, where the government worries the transaction could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6033ee95-96cd-4c5b-b84a-196bf573f5a7\">undermine national security</a> in addition to the CMA's competition concerns.</p> <p>Nvidia's chief executive <strong>Jensen Huang</strong>, who told the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480\">earlier this month</a> that the drawn-out discussions with regulators were “pushing out the timetable” beyond its original 18-month timeline, could face an even longer wait.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tom Montag</strong> and <strong>Anne Finucane</strong>, two of the central figures in<strong> Bank of America</strong>'s recovery from the 2008-09 financial crisis, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/6bf312c9-69d5-45ea-ad8f-d71b15da530f\">are stepping down</a> at the end of the year. Finucane, the bank's vice-chair, is one of the most senior women on Wall Street while Montag holds the titles of chief operating officer and president of global banking and markets.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Lordstown Motors </strong>has appointed <strong>Daniel Ninivaggi </strong>as chief executive to replace Steve Burns, the company's founder, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/262690d0-ad60-4488-9e90-e96a465267ab\">who resigned in June</a>. Ninivaggi, who previously led <strong>Icahn Enterprises</strong>, joins as the electric vehicle maker faces probes by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e3835cd-b445-4a26-b3ec-62ced12536f6\">US regulators</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/589dad7d-9bd7-454b-84d5-ff97cd3c2422\">federal prosecutors</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Intel Corporation</strong> has appointed <strong>Bruce Andrews</strong> as corporate vice-president and chief government affairs officer. He joins from<strong> SoftBank</strong>, where he was senior vice-president and a managing partner.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Biased boardrooms </strong>Corporate Japan is under pressure to increase opportunities for women.
