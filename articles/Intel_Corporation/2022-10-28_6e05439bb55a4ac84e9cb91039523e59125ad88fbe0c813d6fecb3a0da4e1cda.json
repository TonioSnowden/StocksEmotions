The end is in sight,\" Conger said.</p><p>See: Market expectations start to shift in direction of slower pace of rate hikes by Fed</p><p>The September core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation pressures — came in roughly in line with economists expectations, while a more modest 1.2% gain in private wages and salariesin the third quarter was interpreted as a sign that wage growth may have finally peaked, according to Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>See: GDP looked great for the U.S. economy, but it really wasn't</p><p>Investors have digested a batch of disappointing numbers from some of America's largest tech companies this week, which helped to sully the overall quality of S&amp;P 500 earnings this quarter.</p><p>On Thursday night, Amazon.com AMZN joined Microsoft Corp.
