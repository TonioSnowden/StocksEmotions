  "text": "<p>The release of Samsung 's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong , from prison earlier this month -- a parole the Justice Ministry attributed in part to \"economic factors\" -- has raised expectations of bolder moves from the company. Mr. Lee's supporters argue that Samsung failed to make big strategic decisions and delayed investments while competitors charged ahead amid a historic chip shortage that has elevated semiconductors to the top of national agendas.</p><p>One key decision awaiting Mr. Lee's approval is the location of a planned Samsung Electronics Co . semiconductor plant in the U.S. The $17 billion chip factory will be a key part of the Korean company's bid to compete in the foundry business -- making chips under contract for the companies that design them. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . currently dominates the foundry business, and Samsung faces new competition from Intel Corp ., which recently announced plans to get back into the business of making chips for others.</p><p>Samsung has been considering sites in Texas, New York and Arizona since at least January.</p><p>TSMC plans to plow $100 billion into extra chip capacity over the next three years. Intel 's planned spending is lower, though it is exploring a deal to buy GlobalFoundries Inc . for around $30 billion, The Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p>On Tuesday, Samsung reiterated that it would pursue mergers and acquisitions to \"solidify technology and market leadership.\" Samsung Electronics , which has more than $80 billion in net cash, hasn't sprung for a major acquisition in roughly four years. But on its second-quarter earnings call last month, the company said it would seek one within three years, citing artificial intelligence, 5G mobile networks and automotive tech as potential target areas.</p><p>Though Samsung didn't break down the new investment plan by business division, a large part of the spending is likely earmarked for crown jewel Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest maker of memory chips and a major player in the global chip-foundry business.</p><p>The South Korean conglomerate will also push to expand its contract drug-manufacturing business led by Samsung Biologics Co . and its biosimilars-development business led by Samsung Bioepis Co .</p><p>The company has produced biologic drugs for some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co . and Roche Holding Ltd .</p><p>In May, Samsung Biologics signed a deal to provide fill-and-finish packaging for hundreds of millions of doses of Moderna Inc .'s Covid-19 vaccine. It is working to add drug-substance-manufacturing capacity for messenger-RNA vaccines, and would need to expand the arrangement with Moderna or strike new ones with other pharmaceutical companies to gain a bigger foothold, industry analysts say.</p><p>On Tuesday, Samsung also pointed to batteries as a target for investment. Samsung SDI Co ., in its earnings call last month, said it planned to enter the U.S. electric-vehicle battery market, but didn't say when. The company is scouting a number of U.S. sites for a battery plant, including Illinois, a Samsung SDI spokesman said.</p>",
