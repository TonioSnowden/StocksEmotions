  "title": "Intel CEO Gelsinger's reaps near-$180 million windfall from ‘significant magnitude' of new-hire awards",
  "text": "<p>He started the year as VMware Inc.'s VMW chief executive officer, where he took in total compensation of $16.5 million during the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, 2021.</p><p>Then Gelsinger was named Intel Corp.'s INTC CEO, effective Feb. 15.</p><p>In Intel's 2021 proxy statement filed early Wednesday, the semiconductor giant said Gelsinger's total compensation for the year was $178.6 million, basically for ten-and-a-half months of work.</p><p>The compensation included $1.10 million in salary, a $1.75 million sign-on bonus, $5.1 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation, option awards valued at $29.1 million and stock awards valued at $140.4 million.</p><p>There was also $401,600 in “All Other Compensation,” which included $257,100 in residential security and $48,700 in company-provided transportation, and $685,000 in the change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings.</p><p>Don't miss: Intel stock surges after company moves to replace CEO Swan with VMware chief.</p><p>“In providing Mr. Gelsinger new-hire equity awards of significant magnitude, the [Compensation] Committee took action to hire the best leader possible for Intel during a critical period, and to provide him with sufficient incentive to join Intel and forfeit approximately $50 million in equity awards from his prior employer,” the Compensation Committee explained to shareholders.</p><p>Robert Swan, who Gelsinger took the reins from on Feb. 15, received total compensation of $605,300 in 2021, including $156,300 in salary and $449,000 in all other compensation.</p><p>To put Gelsinger's compensation last year in some perspective, after Swan was named CEO on Jan. 31, 2019, following seven months as interim CEO, he received total 2019 compensation of $66.9 million, including $1.2 million in salary, $3.7 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation and stock awards valued at $61.7 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel's stock didn't do too well last year, but Gelsinger may be starting to show his value to shareholders this year.</p><p>Intel's stock gained 3.4% in 2021, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX powered up 41.2%, rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD soared 56.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA climbed 18.7%.</p><p>Year to date, however, Intel shares have slipped 0.1%, while the SOX has dropped 11.1%, AMD's stock has shed 17.2% and the Dow has slipped 3.1%.</p><p>VMware's stock dropped 17.4% last year, but has gained 0.3% so far this year.</p><p>For 2022, Intel's Compensation Committee targets total compensation for Gelsinger at about $26.3 million, which would put him in the 50th percentile of Intel's peer group for CEO compensation.</p>",
