  "text": "<p>Cobham, the private-equity backed UK aerospace and defence group, has launched a £2.6bn takeover bid for listed peer Ultra Electronics. </p> <p>Ultra said that Cobham, which was bought last year by US buyout fund Advent International, had pitched its offer at £35 per share in cash with shareholders also entitled to the interim dividend of 16.2p apiece. The price represents a 42 per cent premium to Ultra's closing value on Thursday and a 63.1 per cent premium to the undisturbed price. </p> <p>“Having considered the proposal, the board has indicated to Cobham that it is at a value the board would be minded to recommend to Ultra shareholders, subject to consideration and satisfactory resolution of other terms and arrangements, including the establishment of safeguards for the interests of Ultra's stakeholder groups,” Ultra said. “In relation to this, Cobham has indicated to the board that it is minded to offer the UK government appropriate undertakings in respect of national security.”</p> <p>Cobham had said last month it was considering a bid for Ultra&#xa0;to create a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd0367d-2679-4476-beb3-b870a511952e\">global defence electronics champion</a>”. Ultra had fired back with a strongly-worded statement saying it had received no proposal&#xa0;from its suitor.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> said in a first-quarter trading update that its European and African divisions had returned to growth. The telecoms group reported a 3.3 per cent improvement in service revenue for the quarter ended June, which was better than analysts had expected but included a one-off gain of 1 percentage point related to last year's Covid-19 disruption. Vodafone said it remained on track to match full-year guidance. </p> <p><strong>NatWest</strong> said it had agreed a deal to sell parts of its Ulster Bank division to Permanent TSB as part of a winding down of operations in Ireland. The lender said it will transfer approximately 25 branches and €7.6bn of gross performing loans, mostly relating to non-tracker mortgages.</p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong> said it had made an encouraging start to the year, with first quarter group sales up 6.3 per cent versus two years ago thanks to the introduction of new products and continued marketing investment. The maker of Mr Kipling cakes and Sharwood's cooking sauces said that for the year ending March&#xa0;it now expected to deliver an adjusted pre-tax profit at the top end of expectations.</p> <p><strong>Beazley</strong> left guidance unchanged and released $95.7m previously set aside for claims after swinging into profit at the half-year stage. The Lloyd's of London insurer posted a $167.3m interim pre-tax profit versus a $13.8m loss a year ago. Management said it would wait for the year end to decide on when to restart dividends.</p> <p><strong>Hotel Chocolat</strong> said it had raised £40m with an overnight placing of new shares at 355p apiece. The retailer said the fundraising, which was equivalent to about 9 per cent of its existing share capital, “will be utilised to fund capital investment to increase long-term sales capacity and capitalise on anticipated future growth.” The stock closed on Thursday at 360p.</p> <p><strong>Brewin Dolphin</strong> reported quarterly net inflows of £700m in the quarter ended June. The wealth manager said total funds rose 6.5 per cent to a record high of £56bn.</p> <p>Fashion label <strong>Ted Baker</strong> said it has chosen a new global headquarters in London's Fitzrovia district. The office, to be rebranded Gorgeous Brown Building, has been leased from Westminster City Council and will be at a lower rent than its longstanding headquarters in King's Cross, known as Ugly Brown Building, that Ted Baker sold and leased back last year. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>The European Central Bank</strong>'s decision to become more tolerant of inflation before raising interest rates has&#xa0;sparked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b329cbe7-1d93-41f5-8812-297f0e03de58\">immediate criticism</a>&#xa0;from some of its more hawkish policymakers in an indication of the divisions within the central bank over when to scale back bond-buying. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, complained that the ECB's new conditions were too aggressive and increased the risk of inflation surging above its target.</p> <p><strong>Mike Lynch</strong> can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b31f5667-5ebc-4f0e-9770-20bb69105bcb\">be&#xa0;extradited</a> to the US, a London judge ruled yesterday in a case seen as a test of British courts' willingness to block business executives' removal. The billionaire founder of software company Autonomy has been charged in the US with 17 counts of conspiracy and fraud relating to Hewlett-Packard's purchase of Autonomy for $11bn in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Intel</strong>'s chief executive said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb9cc57-9cec-4526-b6f9-110ef32b6bfe\">more consolidation</a> was needed in the chip manufacturing industry, days after a report that the US chipmaker was in talks to buy GlobalFoundries for $30bn. “We just view that smaller players won't be able to keep up,” Pat Gelsinger said. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Tom Braithwate</strong> <br>Parent company Unilever cannot distance itself from Ben &amp; Jerry's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f89ac04-5a08-4297-9b6f-90d739211277\">stop selling ice cream</a> in the occupied Palestinian territories. Brand independence is an illusion, so Unilever should either defend the policy or change it.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f60fa3f6-ff3e-4012-8bd4-e483a3cb1eb0\">jettisoning of industry for innovation</a> makes sense. But there are still signs that something has been lost in the UK's strategic reshuffle.&#xa0;The proliferation of government bodies and initiatives risks a scattering of small budgets that then fail to make an impact.</p> <p><strong>City Insider</strong> <br>A takeover approach in London's junior market with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e0b5a00-5e49-4ae5-9712-6ca69924f4ad\">a very familiar cast</a>, an experiment in cash-free shopping at Wm Morrison, and a self-confessed curmudgeon on the importance of being earnest. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Cobham launches £2.6bn bid for rival Ultra Electronics' FT.com 23 July.
