  "text": "<p>Business isn't great for semiconductor-manufacturing gear right now -- or at least it isn't going to be. Chip makers are pulling back on their capital-spending plans quickly as their own businesses get hit by slumping demand in key markets such as PCs and smartphones.</p><p>This might seem like an odd time for a company like ASML to rev up its production plans. At an analyst meeting on Friday, the company projected its own annual capital expenditures would hit 1.5 billion euros, equivalent to $1.55 billion, by 2025 -- a 50% jump from the target it gave a year ago. The spending is intended to fund a significant increase in production capacity. ASML now plans to produce about 90 units of its high-end EUV lithography tools in 2025, 50% more than it expects to produce next year.</p><p>That EUV projection is particularly noteworthy given how difficult the machines are to make. EUV refers to the extreme ultraviolet light used to power the lasers that etch circuitry into chips. The circuitry made by EUV machines allows chip makers to produce smaller processors that consume less energy -- a key to allowing semiconductor companies to continue to advance their designs as principles such as Moore's Law hit physical limitations. But ASML has natural limitations of its own: The lenses for its EUV machines come from a single supplier and can take 12 months to produce.</p><p>A radical boost in production capacity, therefore, doesn't come easily or without risk in the highly cyclical market for chip-making gear. But ASML has some big advantages: It is the world's only producer of EUV lithography tools, and those tools are vital for chip makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel and Samsung to remain competitive at the so-called leading edge of manufacturing. Even chip makers that are reducing capital expenditures elsewhere are unlikely to cancel their ASML orders for fear of being sent to the back of the line. The company's backlog now totals 38 billion euros, or nearly two years of revenue at its current run rate.</p><p>ASML also told analysts on its earnings call last month that new export restrictions that limit the sale of advanced chip-making gear to China will have minimal impact, as the company has \"more than sufficient demand for these systems elsewhere globally as demand continues to exceed supply.\" In fact, the growing politicization of the chip business could even help the company as the U.S. and Europe invest in building up domestic chip-making capacity.</p><p>Wall Street therefore sees ASML's leap of faith as low-risk. In a report Monday, Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research said ASML is one of the few companies \"with the visibility and competitive position required to be able to confidently issue such an outlook.\" Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna upgraded the stock to a positive rating on Monday, saying that ASML's long lead times can \"overcome the looming '23 recession.\" Through Monday, ASML's Dutch-listed shares had jumped 20% since the company issued its updated long-term outlook Thursday, breaking the stock out of a pattern that up to then had mirrored the 37% decline of the broad-er PHLX Semiconductor Index.</p><p>This is one chip stock worth seeing the light on.</p>",
