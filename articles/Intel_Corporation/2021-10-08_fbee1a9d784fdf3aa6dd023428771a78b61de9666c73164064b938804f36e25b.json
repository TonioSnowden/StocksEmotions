  "title": "Seven Women Making an Impact on Either Side of the Fundraising Aisle; Some of the honorees in this year's Women to Watch list have careers that span a range of roles and investor types, including global fundraising teams at private-equity firms, consulting firms, asset managers and even sovereign-wealth funds",
  "text": "<p>Grit, persistence and patience make a good investor relations professional, according to Sarah Smith, who rejoined Advent International Corp. in 2011 as part of the firm's limited partner services group, handling fundraising and investor relations in North America and Latin America. Before that, Ms. Smith worked as an associate focused on investing in consumer and retail sectors. During her time at Advent, Ms. Smith has worked across seven fundraising initiatives that raised over $50 billion, including the firm's first technology-focused fund in 2019. The role sheds insight on different perspectives of the business, according to Ms. Smith. \"It's really fun to kind of see all angles of the business,\" she said. \"You really get a really interesting bird's-eye view of what happened.\" In the decade since she joined the team, regulatory and deal complexities have increased, and investors demand more detail, more granular reporting. \"I've worked hard at building a skill set and developing relationships both within the firm but also with our investors and my peers, so that I can understand how the industry's evolving, understand the needs of our investors, be that conduit and that mouthpiece internally, to say that this is what's happening out there,\" Ms. Smith said.</p><p>Sheila Ryan, Partner, Cambridge Associates</p><p>Sheila Ryan credits experience and exposure to various private-markets asset classes for her success as an investor. Before joining Cambridge Associates in 2007, Ms. Ryan worked at Intel Capital, the venture-capital investment arm of Intel Corp. Before that, she spent 12 years on the trading floor at Salomon Brothers Inc. advising institutional clients on their fixed-income, asset-backed and derivatives portfolios. Cambridge Associates provided her the opportunity to \"take all that history and put it to work across asset classes and really leverage that experience,\" Ms. Ryan said. Almost 50% of the diligence she conducts on potential managers is based on qualitative analysis. \"You can get a spreadsheet with numbers, and anyone can slice and dice the numbers. It's the qualitative stuff that's harder and where I think experience comes into play,\" Ms. Ryan said. For Ms. Ryan, alignment of interest among various members of the firm is critical and she even interviews people who left the firm to find out why they left. \"Sometimes, they'll be transparent with us and sometimes they won't, but we get a lot on the culture and stability of the firm,\" Ms. Ryan said. Her first activity every morning: working out on her Peloton. \"It flushes out the toxins and stress and is so cathartic,\" she said.</p><p>Gina Lee Peyton, Partner and Head of Capital Formation, Castlelake</p><p>Since she joined Castlelake in 2017, Gina Lee Peyton has helped the firm nearly double its assets under management to roughly $20.2 billion. She has been instrumental in helping the Minneapolis-based firm grow its limited-partner relationships, including in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Ms. Peyton said she was able to grow professionally partly thanks to the varied roles she has held, including in the placement world where she began her career with Merrill Lynch and in the fund-of-funds world at Pantheon Ventures. \"That's reflective of the industry,\" she said. \"You have the ability to find different pockets as you change and evolve as a professional.\" Ms. Peyton has been active in networking and team building both within Castlelake itself and across the industry. She has expanded the firm's capital formation team from five to 16 professionals, including seven women, according to her nomination. In 2020, she also launched the Twin Cities chapter of the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN), a networking organization for women in the private-equity industry. Networks like PEWIN play an important role in helping professionals work together toward commonly held goals or initiatives that are important to the industry even in an atmosphere of health competition, according to Ms. Peyton. \"It's no longer taboo to see two competitors sitting side by side deep in conversation,\" she said.</p><p>Heidi Miskin, Head of Funds and Co-investments, Americas, GIC Private Ltd.</p><p>Collaboration, harnessing diversity and having a learner's mind-set are qualities that make a good investor, according to Heidi Miskin, who has spent close to 17 years at GIC Private Ltd. and was promoted to her new role in June. When Ms. Miskin joined GIC's funds and co-investments group, the New York team comprised two people, and since then has grown to 12 people, with women making up more than 50% of her team. According to Ms. Miskin, for long-term partnership-focused investors like GIC, it is \"imperative that we are open-minded and also super up-to-date about what's going on not only in the market today, but also the possibilities of what might emerge in the future and potential disruptive trends.\" As a mom to a nine-year-old, Ms. Miskin doesn't have too much free time but loves to cook and tries to come up with creative cooking recipes to spend time with her daughter. A favorite: a vegan lasagna they both put together.</p><p>Shavonne Correia, Head of Investor Relations and Marketing, KPS Capital Partners</p><p>Shavonne Correia is a \"professional's professional,\" says KPS Capital Partners' co-founder and Managing Partner Michael Psaros. Ms. Correia, who spearheads New York-based KPS's investor relations efforts, was critical in helping the firm round up a quick $7 billion for its two most recent funds, which closed in the fall of 2019 in a four-week period, according to Mr. Psaros. \"She has a deft touch with our investors world-wide,\" he said. \"She has established a personal relationship with substantially all of our investors in 26 countries.\" Before Ms. Correia joined KPS in 2016, she was a vice president at Pantheon Ventures. In addition to her investor relations work at KPS, she shepherds the firm's summer fellowship with Heartland Capital Strategies, a partnership focused on the responsible investment labor capital strategies movement. She also actively supports Seizing Every Opportunity, a program focused on education and career advancement for young people from underserved communities. A mother of two and an avid runner, Ms. Correia has completed 17 marathons.</p><p>Elizabeth \"Beezer\" Clarkson, Partner, Sapphire Ventures</p><p>Elizabeth \"Beezer\" Clarkson leads Sapphire Partners, an evergreen fund investment vehicle of Sapphire Ventures that she helped establish in 2012 to support venture-capital funds across the globe. In her nomination, her colleagues said Ms. Clarkson has spent more than 20 years striving to \"help create the venture world she wishes was there when she first started out,\" by remaining open to new voices at the table and democratizing access to venture. Ms. Clarkson began her career in the global infrastructure group at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and has held a variety of direct and indirect venture roles throughout her career, including managing the day-to-day operations of the Draper Fisher Jurvetson Global Network before joining Sapphire. In 2016, she spearheaded the launch of OpenLP, a platform that includes articles, podcasts and videos from entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, limited partners and others to promote greater understanding of issues that are important to the venture community. Jill Richardson, senior marketing manager at Sapphire, said Ms. Clarkson's humility and ability to connect with many different types of people have endeared her to both her colleagues and other investors. \"She's a really great communicator, relatable without pretense or putting on airs,\" she said. \"It's part of the reason she's so effective and so respected.\"</p><p>Shanna O'Reilly, Senior Managing Director, Co-Head, Private Investments, Wellington Management</p><p>Shanna O'Reilly has spent almost 17 years at Wellington Management, and in 2014 spearheaded the formation of the private-equity platform. She credits her persistence and willingness to get into details for getting the opportunity to build and grow the firm's private investments business, which accounts for over $4.5 billion committed capital across four funds and 115 portfolio companies. \"I truly believe that if you put enough hard work and energy into something, you can, in most cases, be successful. I also am not afraid to take risks and challenge the status quo,\" Ms. O'Reilly said. Her favorite conversations are about how she can help colleagues at Wellington. \"I really like the one-on-one interactions, the conversations around how I can help, whether it's as a coach, a good listener, an advice giver, or someone to challenge or debate their thinking to make them better at what they do,\" she said. Ms. O'Reilly's hobbies are linked to what her two young children like, and this summer \"has been a summer of trying to reconnect with friends and family after being isolated or separated from them,\" she added.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com and Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
