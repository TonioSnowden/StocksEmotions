  "text": "<p>Intel says it is planning to seek a separate stock market listing for Mobileye, its driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle unit, as it looks to shore up its battered stock price under chief executive Pat Gelsinger.</p> <p>The US chipmaker said the listing would “unlock value” for its shareholders, but that it would retain majority control of the division, which has been a small but fast-growing part of its expanding range of chip businesses in recent years.</p> <p>The decision followed a steady slide in Intel's shares in recent months, bucking a strong rally among its rivals, as Wall Street has lost confidence in Gelsinger's ability to mount a turnround for its core PC and server chip businesses.</p> <p>Intel's shares jumped 8 per cent on the Mobileye news in after-market trading on Monday. They ended formal trading earlier in the day about 25 per cent below the high point they hit soon after Gelsinger <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51f63b07-aeb8-4961-9ce9-c1f7a4e326f0\">took the top job</a> this year.</p> <p>Intel paid $15bn for Mobileye in 2017 as part of a race to diversify into newer markets for chips. The acquisition was seen at the time as expensive for a group with less than $400m of revenue in its latest financial year at the time. </p> <p>However, the soaring valuations of fast-growing tech companies have since eclipsed that deal. Self-driving car businesses Waymo and Cruise have each been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0dd4302-c69f-42b6-8a37-549ce113a885\">valued at more than $30bn</a> despite having no meaningful revenue.</p> <p>Mobileye, one of Israel's biggest tech successes, has been recognised as an early leader in developing sophisticated crash-avoidance systems used by a host of prominent carmakers. </p> <p>It played an instrumental role in helping Tesla establish Autopilot, but ended the relationship in 2016 as Tesla began <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb75ffd-44eb-4ae3-8bca-ae830fa52111\">pushing the envelope on safety</a> and marketing the product as more of a driverless solution than Mobileye believed it was.</p> <p>Industry sources have said Mobileye's core technology did not have a clear lead over its rivals but it was skilled at establishing relationships with big carmakers.</p> <p>Among Mobileye's strengths is its two-track approach to developing autonomous driving. It has long been a leading supplier of driver-assist systems at scale, earning revenue and industry clout from shipping automotive-grade products. </p> <p>But at the same time, Mobileye has also taken a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46ff4fe4-0ae6-4f68-902c-3fd14d294d72\">“moonshot” approach</a> of developing fully autonomous robotaxis to compete with Waymo and Cruise.</p> <p>On Monday, Intel said Mobileye's revenue would grow more than 40 per cent for the whole of 2021. The business generated $1bn in revenues in the first nine months of the year and operating income of $361m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Intel said it expected to carry out an initial public offering of Mobileye shares in mid-2022, though a final decision has not been made and will depend partly on market conditions. It added that it had “no intention of spinning off or otherwise divesting its majority ownership interest”.</p><p>Source: Richard Waters and Patrick McGee in San Francisco 2021 'Intel plans separate listing for Mobileye autonomous driving unit' FT.com 7 December.
