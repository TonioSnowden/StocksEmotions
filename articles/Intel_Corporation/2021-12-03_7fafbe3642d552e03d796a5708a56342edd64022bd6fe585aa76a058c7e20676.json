  "title": "U.S. adds disappointing 210,000 jobs in November in face of severe labor shortage",
  "text": "<p>The increase in hiring — the smallest in a year — was way below Wall Street's expectations. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 573,000 new jobs.</p><p>“Consistent with low jobless claims and record-low layoff announcements, labor shortages are only worsening,” said senior economist Sal Guatieri of BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>The U.S. jobless rate, meanwhile, fell to 4.2% from 4.6% and touched a new pandemic low. Economists say the official rate likely underestimates the true level of unemployment by a few percentage points, however.</p><p>In another encouraging sign, the size of the labor force grew substantially. Some 594,000 people rejoined the labor force in November, based on a separate survey of households</p><p>The so-called rate of participation rose two ticks to 61.8% and reached the highest level since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>The household survey also showed a much larger 1.14 million people found work in November, but it's a more volatile number than the poll of businesses from which the government derives the official increase in employment.</p><p>Want intel on all the news moving markets each day?Sign up for our daily Need to Know newsletter.</p><p>Read: Jobless claims jump 28,000 to 222,000, but big ups and downs around Thanksgiving raise questions</p><p>Businesses have sought to cope with a labor-market shortage by increasing pay and benefits. Hourly pay rose sharply again last month and wages have climbed 4.8% in the past year. The last time wages rose that rapidly before the pandemic was in the early 1980s.</p><p>Big picture: Businesses still can't attract workers fast enough to meet their needs.</p><p>At the current pace of hiring, employment levels in the U.S. might not return to pre-crisis trends for two years — or more. The longer the labor shortage persists, the longer it will take for the U.S economy to make a full recovery.</p><p>What's the holdup?</p><p>An unusually higher number of people retired during the pandemic and millions more are still too anxious to return to work. They fear exposure to the coronavirus or worry they might have to stay home to care for their kids, especially if new strains of the coronavirus emerge and shut down schools again.</p><p>The increase in the size of the labor force in November was good news, but it remains to be seen if the uptrend is sustained.</p><p>What they are saying? “This report is a tale of two surveys,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America&#xa0;at the Indeed Hiring Lab.</p><p>“The household survey shows accelerating employment gains, workers returning to the labor force, and low levels of involuntary part-time work,” he said. “The payroll survey shows a significant deceleration in job growth, particularly in Covid-affected sectors.”</p><p>Read:U.S. consumer confidence sinks to 9-month low on inflation and Covid worries</p><p>Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&amp;P500 SPX were set to open higher in Friday trades. Markets extended gains after the report.</p>",
