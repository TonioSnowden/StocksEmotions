  "title": "Binance Hires Ex-FBI Agent  To Head Up Investigations  ----  By Vicky Ge Huang",
  "text": "<p>   The U.S. arm of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has hired former FBI agent BJ Kang as its first head of investigations. </p><p>   In his new role, Mr. Kang will work closely with law enforcement, regulators and other crypto companies, Binance.US said. The company said it would build Binance.US's own \"investigations infrastructure\" to identify and mitigate crypto-related criminal activities on the platform. </p><p>   Mr. Kang, known for high-profile investigations of some of the biggest insider-trading cases on Wall Street, could lend credibility to the exchange as it faces probes from federal authorities. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have launched probes into several crypto companies. </p><p>   During Mr. Kang's 20 years investigating financial crimes at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he led investigations into insider-trading cases against Galleon Fund then-chief Raj Rajaratnam and Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. Mr. Kang joined Binance.US after retiring from the FBI. </p><p>   The digital-asset market has seen a significant reversal in prices this year and several once-highflying crypto startups plunged into bankruptcy, prompting government officials to call for tougher oversight. </p><p>   Over the past year, Binance.US has increased the head count of its legal, compliance and risk operations by 145%, with more than 20% of the company's staff serving in these roles. </p><p>   Brian Shroder, chief executive of Binance.US, said the team's budget, which has tripled over the past year, is in the millions of dollars. The company hired Sidney Majalya in December from Intel Corp. as its first chief risk officer and Tammy Weinrib in February from Societe Generaleas its chief compliance officer. </p><p>   \"As we continue to expand and grow, we wanted to put more resources into keeping the platform safe,\" Mr. Shroder said in an interview. \"We wanted to put our best foot forward in terms of helping to police not only our platform but kind of the broader crypto ecosystem.\" </p><p>   Mr. Kang most recently served in the FBI's Washington Field Office cybercrime squad, investigating international insider-trading schemes, cyber-enabled money laundering, cyber extortion and hackers targeting crypto and financial firms, among others. </p><p>   \"Close coordination between the crypto industry and relevant law enforcement agencies to identify and punish bad actors is required to increase trust and enable the crypto ecosystem to continue to grow,\" Mr. Kang said in a statement. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Dave Michaels contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
