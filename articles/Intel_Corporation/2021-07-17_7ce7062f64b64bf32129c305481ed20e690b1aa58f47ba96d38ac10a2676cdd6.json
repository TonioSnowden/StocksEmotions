  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Adventure & Travel -- Journal Concierge / An Insider's Guide:  Key West  ---  To get past the tourist kitsch of Florida's fabled  playground, follow the advice of these in-the-know locals  ----  By David Farley",
  "text": "<p>\n  Located at the end of Florida's 113-mile Overseas Highway, Key West inspires unabashed revelry, even in the steamy summer. Maybe that's because, as one of the southernmost points in the contiguous U.S., it feels more Caribbean than continental. Or perhaps it's because raucous, sun-bleached bars flank Duval Street, its main drag. But don't dismiss this city of around 24,000 as a party town. Countless writers have yielded to its tropical magnetism over the years -- Ernest Hemingway stayed for a decade, and Tennessee Williams, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens all spent time here. Stevens once complained that his frequent winter escape was becoming \"furiously literary.\" Here, we ask four locals, including one noted scribe, for their favorite aspects. The intel they share goes beyond frozen daiquiris and Papa Hemingway look-alike contests to reveal hidden beaches, hole-in-the-wall coffee shops, and three contenders for the \"best\" vantage point from which to watch the sun set. Which wins? Go judge for yourself. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  THE AUTHOR </p><p>\n  Judy Blume </p><p>\n  Author and co-founder of Books &amp; Books at the Studios of Key West </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  SERVE AND VOLLEY / Salute!
