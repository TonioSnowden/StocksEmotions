Intel had forecast margins of 53.5% for the fourth quarter, and Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger assured analysts that margins would remain “comfortably above 50%”</p><p>Last quarter, Intel caught the ire of many analysts who were concerned the company's aggressive capital buildout plans would weigh too heavily on profit margins. Those pressured margins appear to have pushed the company's earnings forecast below Wall Street expectations. Intel forecast GAAP gross margins of 49%, and non-GAAP margins of 52% for the first quarter.</p><p>For the first quarter, Intel forecast revenue of about $18.3 billion, and GAAP earnings of 70 cents a share and non-GAAP earnings of 80 cents a share.

Zinsner, who officially started last week, is the former CFO of Micron Technology Inc. MU.</p><p>Read:The pandemic PC boom gave personal computers their biggest year in nearly a decade</p><p>Wednesday's earnings report comes on the heels of a report earlier in the day that Intel won its appeal against a $1.2 billion EU antitrust fine.</p><p>Late Tuesday, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN kicked off earnings season for U.S. chip makers, reporting quarterly results and an outlook that topped Wall Street expectations.</p><p>Earlier in the month, Intel said at CES it was releasing its “Alchemist” Arc ray-tracing graphics chip to compete with the likes of Nvidia Corp.
