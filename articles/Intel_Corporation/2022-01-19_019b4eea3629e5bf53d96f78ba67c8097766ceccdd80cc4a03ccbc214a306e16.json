If Pioneer hasn't consummated a business combination on or before Dec. 15 and seeks to redeem its public shares, Acorns will be required to pay the company $15 million by Dec. 22, provided that Pioneer doesn't “withdraw that determination,” according to the filing.</p><p>The companies had agreed to merge last May in a deal that valued Acorns at $2.2 billion. Acorns runs a fintech platform with checking, retirement, and investment accounts and lets people round up the spare change from their spending to use on investments.</p><p>Pioneer's stock gained 4.0% to close at $10.40 on May 27, 2021 after the merger was originally announced. Since then, it has lost 4.7% to trade below where it closed prior to the merger announcement, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 9.3% over the same time.</p>",
