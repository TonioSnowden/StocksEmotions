The home retailer was removed from Wedbush's “Best Ideas” list, replaced with Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. DKS Williams-Sonoma shares sank 7.2% in Wednesday trading.</p><p>Analysts said the company's same-store sales have slowed since the company last reported quarterly earnings and cited a New York Post report that the company laid off many seasonal customer service and logistics employees before Christmas, which is earlier than usual. They also noted higher promotions year-over-year in December.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma's portfolio of brands includes the namesake chain, Pottery Barn and West Elm.</p><p>“While furniture and home furnishings category sales remained robust through November based on Census Bureau data, sales likely slowed in December due to the rise of the Omicron variant and as many shoppers pulled holiday buying forward due to news headlines warning of supply shortages,” analysts wrote.</p><p>“Williams-Sonoma should be advantaged by its strong brands and its omnichannel platform but is not immune to these category-wide pressures.”</p><p>Wayfair stock has fallen 29.6% over the last year. Williams-Sonoma has rallied 44.1%. And the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 25.4% for the period.</p>",
