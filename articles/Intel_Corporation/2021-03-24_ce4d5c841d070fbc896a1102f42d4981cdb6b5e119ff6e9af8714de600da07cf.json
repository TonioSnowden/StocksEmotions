  "text": "<p><em>Hi everyone, Mercedes here in Singapore. The big news this week comes from a US company — Intel — but it will have huge implications for Asia and some of the region's biggest companies, including TSMC and Samsung. Shares in both companies fell in Asia trading despite Intel's pledge to be open to partnering and “co-opetition”. Don't miss James's take on China's climb up the patent league tables. Finally, a Japanese company is cleaning up space junk — the first-ever commercial orbital clean-up mission.</em> </p> <h2>The Big Story</h2> <p>Intel has laid down the gauntlet to Asian competitors TSMC and Samsung. The US group will spend $20bn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/987b5761-6b59-48f3-8f52-52a4fb84264e\">build two semiconductor factories</a> in Arizona, part of a multiyear strategy unveiled by newly-appointed chief executive Pat Gelsinger that puts to bed any rumours Intel would withdraw from manufacturing after falling behind its rivals. <br><br>The new “fabs” are expected to begin production in 2024. Building will start this year, creating 3,000 construction jobs. Once completed, the fabs will create at least 3,000 “permanent high-tech, high-wage jobs” and about 15,000 local long-term jobs, according to Intel.</p> <p><strong>Key implications:</strong> Intel's entry into the foundry segment is a challenge to its Asian rivals. Shares in both Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung fell after the news broke. Intel plans to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Intel-challenges-Taiwan-s-TSMC-in-chip-foundry-business\">ramp up production capacity</a> and win over Apple and other important global clients from its competitors.</p> <p>But Intel said it would be more open to what it called “co-opetition”, or finding ways to partner with — and outsource to — traditional rivals including TSMC and Samsung. Management said that as well as outsourcing, Intel was also launching a service to make computer chips for other companies. </p> <p><strong>Upshot: </strong>Intel's move comes amid a global chip shortage that is causing havoc in multiple industries, creating an opportunity. “Intel is in [a] unique position to rise to the occasion and meet this growing demand,” Gelsinger&#xa0;said. </p> <p><em>For more, don't miss today's </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\"><em>FT Big Read</em></a><em> on TSMC — the most important company few people have heard of.</em> </p> <h2>Mercedes' top 10</h2> <ol>  <li><p>Alibaba's international AliExpress app, aimed at boosting overseas sales, is starting to gain <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/Alibaba-makes-growing-impression-in-Europe-with-livestreaming\">traction</a> in <strong>Europe</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Japan</strong>'s messaging app Line has <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Line-cuts-off-access-from-China-to-protect-personal-data-in-Japan\">cut off</a> <strong>China</strong>'s access to user data in the wake of disclosures that affiliates had been able to see Japanese users' information. </p></li>  <li><p>Are <strong>China</strong>'s walled tech gardens crumbling?

In 2020, awards of technology patents to Chinese companies from the European Patent Office rose 10 per cent, more than for the companies of any other country.</p> <p>In patent applications to the EPO, China's growth also leads.&#xa0;On this trajectory, it could challenge Germany and Japan to rank second to the US in seven years, in terms of annual patent applications to the EPO.</p> <p>A similar dynamic is under way at the World Intellectual Property Organization, a UN agency, where Huawei is the leading corporate applicant for patents and two-thirds of applications came from Asian companies last year.</p> <p>But just as China ascends to the commanding heights of global innovation,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67970305-4f33-4a5f-a797-23336b7ee6af\">growing concerns</a>&#xa0;over data privacy within networked devices threatens to stymie sales of its technology around the world. From installations of “smart city” technology in the west to 5G telecoms equipment and a multitude of other devices, suspicion clings to Chinese products. If this deepens, it could rip the world of tech apart.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>— James</em></p> <h2>Art of the deal</h2> <p><strong>Baidu</strong>, known as China's answer to <strong>Google</strong>, was betting on its $3.1bn secondary listing in Hong Kong as a symbol of its revival. But the big debut <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89c20dea-56f6-422c-8dd9-598fc93af303\">fizzled on Tuesday</a> — much like its stagnating search business. </p> <p>To be fair, Baidu is not an isolated case. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-20/ipo-mania-fizzles-in-hong-kong-as-mega-first-day-pops-disappear\">Almost one-third</a> of IPOs raising more than $100m posted losses on their first day of trading this year in Hong Kong, nearly double the rate in 2020. But a flat debut is still well below the 160 per cent first-day surge of short video app <strong>Kuaishou</strong> last month. </p> <p>Baidu has been expanding into businesses including electric vehicles, cloud services, AI and video streaming in a bid to increase revenues. But the company has — like many other Chinese tech giants — come under scrutiny from mainland regulators, which issued the group with a fine in March. Analysts said Baidu's outlook remained promising but investors at least are clearly more excited by other technology companies.</p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>Right after we published last week, Chinese ecommerce group <strong>Pinduoduo</strong> announced <strong>Colin Huang</strong>, its highflying and secretive founder, had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94a39cee-fc41-44c7-9abe-a79ffa30ab96\">unexpectedly quit</a>. </p> <p>Under Huang, Pinduoduo went from a discount ecommerce app five years ago to a more than $200bn force, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Alibaba-s-grip-on-e-commerce-pried-loose-by-rivals-and-regulators\">taking a sledgehammer</a> to rival <strong>Alibaba</strong>'s iron grip on Chinese online consumption. Pinduoduo has become a “youth entering adolescence”, Huang said upon announcing his departure, adding he would make way for a new generation of the leaders. But the company's rapid growth has been powered by cheap deals and it remains heavily in the red. It has appointed <strong>Chen Lei</strong> as its new chair. </p> <p>But what of Huang? His presence will still loom over the company. The 41-year old, whom Chinese media call “mysterious”, remains the largest shareholder in Pinduoduo. Huang said he would turn over his voting rights to the board and would not sell any shares for three years while he pursued interests in life sciences. </p> <h2>Smart data</h2> <p>China's president <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> is determined to unshackle the country from foreign-made computer chips. But the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21d70ba3-f3c7-4f2a-b311-c5850d0d1af6\">corporate debt woes</a> of <strong>Tsinghua Unigroup</strong>, a national chip champion, illustrate the struggle faced by companies and local governments alike to achieve that vision. </p> <p>Tsinghua defaulted on a domestically issued bond in November and its problems threaten to embroil a clutch of China's most important chip companies, which it either owns or has stakes in <em>(see chart)</em>. Nor are the group's issues unique. Another mainland chip company executive said: “So far, there is no possibility of profiting. It is very difficult to maintain cash flow. I don't know how long we will last.”</p><p>Source: Mercedes Ruehl and James Kynge 2021 'Intel lays down challenge to Asian rivals TSMC and Samsung' FT.com 24 March.
