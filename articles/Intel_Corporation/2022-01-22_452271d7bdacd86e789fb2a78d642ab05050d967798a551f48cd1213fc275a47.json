  "title": "Intel to Invest $20 Billion To Produce Chips in Ohio",
  "text": "<p>Intel will make some of its most cutting-edge processors at the new site, Mr. Gelsinger said in an interview. Planning for the first two factories will start immediately, with construction expected to begin late in 2022, he said, and production expected to come online in 2025. The company also pledged $100 million toward partnerships with educational institutions to build a pipeline of talent and bolster research programs in the region.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said the semiconductor industry, which just topped $500 billion in combined annual sales, is expected to double by the end of the decade. \"My intention as CEO is to grow our share of that growing market. So I have to be investing and expanding our capacity faster than doubling,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said supply gaps could persist into next year and potentially even into 2024, though they show some signs of easing in the coming months.</p><p>Intel shares closed unchanged at $52.04 in Friday trading amid a market selloff.</p><p>The White House said Friday that Intel's investment plan augmented U.S. efforts to strengthen domestic chip-making. Governments, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, have become concerned with securing their semiconductor supply after years in which manufacturing has gravitated to lower-cost countries in Asia. The chip drought during the pandemic has amplified those worries.</p><p>\"The Covid-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on the fragility in the global semiconductor-supply chain,\" the White House said.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger's move is the latest step in his push to revive the company's fortunes by restoring its position as a cutting-edge chip designer and becoming a leading chip manufacturer, including for other companies. In 2020, graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp. overtook Intel as the U.S.'s most valuable semiconductor company. Samsung Electronics Co. last year overtook Intel as the biggest chip maker by quarterly revenue. Analysts expect the South Korean company to hold on to that position when both report earnings in the coming week.</p><p>Last year, Intel said it planned big investments in chip making in Arizona and New Mexico and a roughly $95 billion commitment to European manufacturing.</p><p>The facility in Ohio is expected to create 3,000 permanent jobs at the new site, the company said. The project is expected to create an additional 7,000 construction jobs and tens of thousands of support jobs. Time magazine earlier reported on Intel's Ohio investment.</p><p>The Ohio location, Mr. Gelsinger said, beat out roughly 40 other sites across the country to win the business. The region landed Intel's investment, in part, by offering infrastructure upgrades, a massive space with room for expansion and other incentives, he said.</p><p>Ohio Lieutenant Gov. Jon Husted said that to secure Intel's investment the state offered tax breaks linked to job creation and infrastructure spending, including for site construction.</p><p>\"We will get a return on our investment,\" the Republican said. The state estimates Intel's facility will add $2.8 billion to the annual gross state product.</p><p>To land the chip plants and reduce the risk of future supply-chain disruptions on their domestic industries, the U.S. and European governments are devising massive subsidy packages. Congress has been working to pass legislation to support chip-company investments in the U.S.</p><p>Last year, the Senate approved $52 billion in funding to support semiconductor research and production, though the legislation needs to make its way through the House. The White House and Democrats are trying to revive momentum for passage of the legislation that includes the chip funding after it slowed amid partisan wrangling.</p><p>---</p><p>Alex Leary contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
