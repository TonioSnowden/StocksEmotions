  "text": "<p>Emmanuel Macron defused popular rage during the yellow vest protests in 2019 with the “grand national debate” that convened citizens, trade unions and politicians to a series of public meetings to discuss everything from the cost of living to tax fairness.</p> <p>Now the French president is trying to repeat the trick by creating a new talking shop aimed at jolting his second term to life after losing his parliamentary majority in June. That political setback, as well as a looming economic downturn and energy crisis, have emboldened his opponents who cast him as a lame duck leader unable to deliver on campaign promises to achieve full employment and raise the retirement age. </p> <p>To seize back momentum, Macron will on Thursday hold the first meeting of his <em>Conseil National de la Refondation, </em>or National Council for Refoundation, featuring about 50 local and national politicians, activists, experts and other stakeholders. </p> <p>In his invitation to the day-long event, Macron pledged to work with “all who want to set aside political squabbling” and to take the “actions needed to protect the French, and ensure their independence and progress”.</p> <p>Its agenda will include the biggest problems facing France as defined by the Elysée — climate change, an ageing population, and revamping health and education systems among others. &#xa0;</p> <p>The president said the CNR, whose name is a nod to the <em>Conseil National de la Résistance</em> created by an exiled General Charles de Gaulle to prepare to rebuild France after the second world war, was not “a new institution but rather a new way of working” for the long term.</p> <p>But as this is not the first time Macron has promised to govern in a more consensual manner, his opponents are sceptical.</p> <p>Unlike de Gaulle's CNR that rallied a swath of the population, Macron's event has been boycotted by many, including Gérard Larcher, head of the Senate from the conservative <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/44d18f5b-5a56-4971-99c7-d744038017f8\">Les Républicains</a>, and four of the big labour unions. Leftwing parties also dismissed the event a “gimmick” from Macron, while Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National warned against it being used to avoid parliamentary debate. </p> <p>Regardless of the outcome of the CNR, even some in Macron's camp are worried that the government has seemed adrift since losing its majority. </p> <p>“There is no vision and little momentum so far in the second term,” said one former adviser. “Macron seems to be stuck in the firefighting mode of managing crises.”</p> <p>Elected at age 39 in 2017 on promises to strengthen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b8021b3-ab0d-4bdf-afb2-c65a3706ed87\">France's economy</a> and renew its political class, Macron's reformist zeal foundered when the yellow vest protests exploded over a proposed fuel tax. His momentum was further stymied by the coronavirus pandemic, which was followed by the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>In April, he saw off far-right rival Le Pen to win re-election — a feat not managed by his two predecessors — only to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/822d003c-028e-4a6b-9e10-97f809ca4f7b\">lose</a> his parliamentary majority two months later. </p> <p>Since then, the government's work has slowed. Although it managed to pass a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5177ce3-83e2-4c4c-bc6c-ccb6383dd75b\">July package</a> aimed at combating inflation, it delayed the opening of the next session to October instead of the usual September start to prepare for an expected restive parliament. </p> <p>Macron was unusually quiet during the summer, allowing his new prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9de47f0c-cf3d-4ea4-b9d9-aefc484f770d\">Élisabeth Borne</a> to lead the anti-inflation drive. When he resurfaced last month, he delivered an uncharacteristically downbeat message that soaring temperatures, drought and an energy crunch showed how the carefree “age of abundance” was over. </p> <p>Soon after, he called on French households and businesses to reduce their energy consumption to avoid “more coercive measures or rationing”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Beyond handling the energy crisis, the government has delayed other promised initiatives, such as a draft law to tighten immigration controls. There is no sign of the once flagship but unpopular retirement reform, although ministers say it is still on the cards. </p> <p>Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist at Sciences Po university, said Macron's approval rating had slipped to 39 per cent, five points lower than in March and lower than those of his prime minister Borne. “People see him as someone who is good at managing a crisis, but on his project to reform France they are less convinced,” he said. </p> <p>The newly strengthened opposition led by the far-left and the far-right parties have no plans to co-operate to help the government legislate, raising the spectre of deadlock. Street protests against the cost of living are also planned.</p> <p>But his allies dispute the idea that Macron's agenda would founder. “In the president's mind every crisis is an opportunity,” said Marc Ferracci, a newly elected MP for Macron's Renaissance party. “The war, the energy crunch, climate change, it all gives him political capital to keep doing reforms.”</p> <p>Gilles Le Gendre, a Renaissance MP elected in 2017, was more circumspect, noting that Macron's rivals were already focused on the battle to succeed him in 2027. </p> <p>“The political landscape is very flammable, which does not lend itself to legislating on difficult issues,” he said. “Perhaps the CNR can help build consensus but only if it does not turn into another top-down presidential project.”</p><p>Source: Leila Abboud in Paris 2022 'Macron convenes French ‘national council' in bid to reboot second term' FT.com 8 September.
