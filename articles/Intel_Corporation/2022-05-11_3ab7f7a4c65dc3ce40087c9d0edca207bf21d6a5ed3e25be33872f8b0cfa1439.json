  "text": "<p>Rana Foroohar reckons that what ails the world trading system are obsessions with efficiency and liberalising trade for its own sake (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38595c58-535e-49fe-8696-d9150de2b074\">Opinion</a>, May 9). Apparently, endorsing the views of US trade representative Katherine Tai, we need a new balance between international trade and domestic policy, presumably to give governments a freer hand. Evidence belies such talking points. </p> <p>First, an important source of disruption to cross-border supply chains now and early in the pandemic were government-imposed export curbs. These are permitted under World Trade Organization rules precisely because values other than efficiency can be used to justify temporary trade restrictions. We all pay a price for these lax WTO rules. Peer-reviewed World Bank research showed that bans on food exports during 2008-11 raised global food prices by 13 per cent and wheat prices by 30 per cent. </p> <p>Second, even where there are WTO rules, they are often more honoured in the breach. The Global Trade Alert's tally of US awards of corporate subsidies since the 2008 global financial crisis stands at 6,070. To give just one example: this January saw the US state of Ohio offer Intel $2.1bn in incentives. </p> <p>Quite frankly, given this extensive discrimination against foreign economies and the billions lavished on American firms, if US officials haven't been able to assuage domestic interests fearful of trade, then they only have themselves to blame. This is the reality the Biden administration, and other WTO members should address. The world's trade problems don't start in Geneva, they end there. </p> <p><strong>Simon J Evenett</strong> <br><em>Professor of International Trade and Economic Development<br>University of St Gallen <br>St Gallen, Switzerland</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: WTO is end, not start of the world's trade problems' FT.com 11 May.
