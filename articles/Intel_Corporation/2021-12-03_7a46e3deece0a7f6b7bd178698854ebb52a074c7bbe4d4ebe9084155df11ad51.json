  "title": "Nio, Alibaba lead losses for U.S.-listed stocks of Chinese companies after Didi delisting news",
  "text": "<p>Alibaba's BABA ADRs dropped more than 8%, looking to end the week off 16%.</p><p>Didi late Thursday said it would start delisting on the NYSE “immediately” and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong. That decision comes after Didi raised $4.4 billion in an initial public offering in June. Didi was caught between simmering pressures from the Chinese government as well as U.S. regulators on U.S.-listed Chinese companies.</p><p>The news came as “no surprise,” said David Trainer, the chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs. The company “was and remains a terribly overvalued business.”</p><p>China does not want the U.S. to own any strategic assets, and the U.S. cannot allow companies that will not share their financials publicly to trade on U.S. exchanges, he said.</p><p>“Didi and many other major Chinese stocks are not likely to last in the U.S. for much longer,” Trainer said.</p><p>Other major U.S.-listed Chinese companies seeing significant stock drops on Friday included e-commerce Pinduoduo Inc. PDD and gaming company NetEase Inc. NTES</p><p>Their drops also came amid broad weakness in the U.S. stock market after a weaker-than-expected November jobs report. </p><p>Subscribe: Want intel on all the news moving markets?
