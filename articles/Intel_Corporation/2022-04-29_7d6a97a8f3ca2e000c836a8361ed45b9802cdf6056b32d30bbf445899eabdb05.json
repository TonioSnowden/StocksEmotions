  "title": "Business News: Intel CEO Sees Chip Shortage Lasting",
  "text": "<p>Intel said Thursday that first-quarter sales fell almost 7% to $18.35 billion, missing Wall Street expectations. Intel generated net income of $8.1 billion.</p><p>Consumer demand for lower-end PCs was particularly slow, Mr. Gelsinger said, even though corporate demand for computers remained strong.</p><p>Inflationary pressures have also affected PC demand, leading computer-makers to reduce their inventories, Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said in a call with analysts. The division that handles chips for PCs saw sales falling 13% to $9.3 billion.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said the global chip shortage he had previously forecast would stretch into 2023 is now likely to last even longer as chip makers struggle to buy enough manufacturing equipment and to boost production to meet demand.</p><p>\"We believe the shortage will last into 2024 now,\" he said. \"In part, that's a supply statement because we have seen that equipment shortages are really impinging the ability of the industry overall to ramp supply at the pace we earlier thought.\"</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said, however, that those challenges wouldn't derail the manufacturing expansion he is spearheading, which includes major new factories in the U.S. and Europe over coming years.</p><p>The company also gave more-muted sales guidance for the second quarter against a backdrop of slower PC sales and uncertainty around the effects of Covid-19 lockdowns in China and Russia's war on Ukraine on broader economic sentiment. If the Chinese lockdowns persist or spread, there could be a more material impact on the outlook, Mr. Zinsner said.</p><p>Intel shares closed up 3.6% Thursday and fell about 4% in late trading after posting its quarterly earnings.</p><p>The semiconductor industry has faced a turbulent period of booming demand during which it has struggled to keep pace. Chip companies have also wrestled with a flurry of disruptions and global supply-chain snarls.</p><p>Dallas-based chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. issued a lower-than-expected revenue forecast in its financial results Tuesday because of uncertainty in China and Europe. Mobile-phone chip maker Qualcomm Inc. exceeded Wall Street expectations with its results Wednesday.</p><p>Despite the chip shortage, industry executives expect annual chip sales globally to double to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Intel is little more than a year into a transformation under Mr. Gelsinger, who took over last year with a mandate to recapture the company's lead in chip-manufacturing technology, which it lost years ago to competitors in Asia.</p><p>Intel has for decades been America's dominant chip maker, commanding a huge market share in chips that power desktops and laptops as well as servers in data centers owned by businesses, governments and internet companies. But Intel has lost some of its gusto in recent years, stumbling to build smaller and faster chips and allowing contract chip makers in Taiwan and South Korea to surpass it.</p><p>Intel provided the first detailed quarterly earnings report on its new contract chip-making venture. Sales for those activities came in at $283 million from what would have been $103 million in the year-ago period. The business lost $31 million at an operating level in the most recent quarter.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
