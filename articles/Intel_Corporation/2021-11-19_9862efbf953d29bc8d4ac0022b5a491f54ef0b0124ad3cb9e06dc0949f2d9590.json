  "text": "<h2>Metro Bank: future shock</h2> <p>It may have been left on the shelf, but Metro Bank still has a vision. Shortly before private equity group Carlyle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/893fcbb2-268c-44a3-aa47-338d29bfcb5d\">pulled out of takeover talks</a> this week, the London-listed lender published a report by behavioural futurist William Higham to advertise its rebranding as Britain's community bank.</p> <p>Higham, who set up a prognosticating consultancy in 2002 after a decade spent doing PR for musicians such as Michael Jackson and Shed Seven, <a href=\"https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/research/back-to-the-future/\">sketches out a future</a> for Britain's high streets that features micro-hospitals, 3D printing studios for arts and crafts, delivery by drone, community currencies and a return of bartering. The report reimagines the bank branch as the gathering point in an artificial intelligence-assisted village, where geotracking and facial recognition technology mean everyone knows your name.</p> <p>Metro is not the first bank to seek out Higham's predictive powers. In 2010, HSBC commissioned <a href=\"http://nextbigthingblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/british-firms-primed-for-great-business.html\">The Great British Business Report</a> from his Next Big Thing consultancy as part of a small business lending promotion. Its conclusions mostly related to how innovation and adaptability would keep Britain relevant on the world stage. Events the report failed to foretell included the resignations of HSBC chair Stephen Green and chief executive Michael Geoghegan a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05960337-35fb-3b4d-9565-b78d360df954\">few months later</a>.</p> <h2>Numis: return to sender</h2> <p>A spat between THG and Numis over an email the investment bank sent to institutional clients is said to have pitted Numis against a former colleague.</p> <p>As first revealed by <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/investment-bank-numis-reports-itself-to-watchdog-after-retracting-memo-about-thg-irregularities-12470950\">Sky News</a>, Numis last week sent, then retracted, an email making reference to “some irregularities in accounting” at Matthew Moulding's ecommerce group. A follow-up explained that Numis “had not identified, and does not believe, THG to have any accounting irregularities”, saying the terminology used “does not represent the views of Numis' research or the views of our research analysts”. </p> <p>According to insiders, the first email was sent by a junior on the sales team who had joined less than a month earlier. The new starter had misinterpreted the already published opinions of lead analyst Simon Bowler around probable sum-of-the-parts values and the potential for Ingenuity, THG's technology outsourcing division, to disappoint, they said. Numis voluntarily reported itself to the Financial Conduct Authority and began a review of safety checks around its non-research client communications. </p> <p>Among those to push for contrition from Numis was Iain McDonald, THG's longest serving non-executive director, according to a person familiar with the companies. McDonald was a retail and ecommerce analyst at Numis between 2002 and 2007, whose dedication to the firm was such that he once owned a NUM1S personalised car number plate. His technology and ecommerce advisory firm, Belerion Capital, remains a Numis client and was on the distribution list for the fateful email. </p> <p>Numis said in a statement that it had “apologised publicly for our error” after its memo “contained some inaccuracies”. THG declined to comment. </p> <h2>Google: never say never be evil</h2> <p>When running a global surveillance network, it's advisable to avoid associations with fictional supervillains. Unfortunate then for Google Cloud's Head of Fintech to accidentally claim credit for the international crime and terrorist organisation that features in the James Bond franchise.</p> <p>“I'm really proud with what we achieved back in 2019 with Spectre,” said Derek Freel to a panel at this week's Fintech Talents Festival in the City of London. He meant to say Sycamore, the quantum computing chip developed by Google's AI division, and quickly corrected himself. “I just saw the James Bond film, which I highly recommend,” he explained.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Metro Bank imagines a brighter future as takeover talks stall' FT.com 19 November.
