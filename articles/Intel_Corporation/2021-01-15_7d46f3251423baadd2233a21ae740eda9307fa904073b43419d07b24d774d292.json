  "title": "Heard on the Street:  TSMC Sailed Through  2020 in Ship Shape  ----  By Jacky Wong",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It's good to be king, particularly when other kingdoms are struggling. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, is benefiting from surging demand, struggling rivals and top-notch technology. And it's betting big on the future to keep that edge. </p><p>\n  TSMC just logged another bumper quarter: Net profit for the three months ended in December rose 23% from a year earlier. That brought full-year profit to a record $17.6 billion, a 50% increase from 2019. </p><p>\n  Strong demand helped TSMC, which makes chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. Stay-at-home demand led to a boom in personal computers and servers used in data centers. Also, 5G smartphones and base stations added to chip demand. </p><p>\n  TSMC sailed smoothly through the Trump administration's ban on Huawei, previously an important customer. China accounted for only 6% of TSMC's revenue last quarter, compared with 22% a year earlier. Orders from Apple and Taiwanese chip company MediaTek, which supplies many Chinese phone makers, probably helped to offset the blow. </p><p>\n  The sudden jump in demand led to tight supply for chips throughout the year. Shortages forced some car makers to delay production. TSMC's revenue from the automotive sector grew 27% last quarter, though the segment accounted for only 3% of its revenue. The supply constraints helped TSMC: The company managed to expand its net profit margin last quarter by 2.9 percentage points compared with a year earlier. </p><p>\n  The chip shortage means a record year of investment ahead for TSMC as well. It expects $25 billion to $28 billion in capital spending this year, a 45% to 62% increase from 2020. Semiconductor-equipment makers like ASML Holding will benefit. </p><p>\n  Those investments mean TSMC is confident about its future. One potential new customer could be Intel, which is considering outsourcing some of its production in the most-chip-advanced nodes. Bernstein estimates capturing 20% of Intel's production needs could boost TSMC's revenue 8%. But even if Intel decides against outsourcing, TSMC could benefit from AMD's rising market share, says Bernstein. AMD, a TSMC customer, has been eroding Intel's market share in CPUs. </p><p>\n  TSMC's shares are trading at 29 times forward earnings, after gaining 79% since the beginning of 2020. That might seem pricey, but the company is spending a lot of cash to maintain its technological edge -- add in growing demand and the struggles of competitors, and that premium valuation looks a bit less hard to swallow. </p><p></p>",
