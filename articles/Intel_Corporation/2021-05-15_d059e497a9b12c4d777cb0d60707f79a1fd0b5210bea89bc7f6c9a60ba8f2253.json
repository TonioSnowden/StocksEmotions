  "title": "U.S. News: Hacking Group to Shut Down",
  "text": "<p>DarkSide has told associates it has lost access to the infrastructure it uses to run its operation and would be closing, citing disruption from a law-enforcement agency and pressure from the U.S., according to security firms FireEye and Intel 471.</p><p>DarkSide didn't respond to requests to comment earlier in the week made through its website before it was shut down.</p><p>It isn't uncommon for ransomware groups such as DarkSide to disband, only to pop up later under a different name. It couldn't be determined if the U.S. had any role in DarkSide's claimed disruption or if the disruption was authentic. It is also possible DarkSide plans to close and reopen under another name.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be surprised if DarkSide has just said, 'It is way too hot,' and they decided to pull the pin on themselves,\" said Winston Krone, the chief research officer with Kivu Consulting Inc., a company that helps victims respond to ransomware incidents.</p><p>The FBI didn't respond to a request to comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.</p><p>Colonial Pipeline Co., the operator of a critical gasoline pipeline to the Eastern U.S., became a DarkSide victim this week and paid close to $5 million to the hackers, according to people familiar with the matter. The company shut down the pipeline May 7 and restarted it Wednesday.</p><p>A European subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. said Friday it was hit by a cyberattack. The company told Reuters it believed DarkSide was behind the attack.</p><p>President Biden on Thursday said his administration was \"in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks\" and would \"pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate,\" though he didn't elaborate. Asked if he would rule out whether the U.S. would respond with cyber operations, Mr. Biden replied \"no.\"</p><p>Some former U.S. officials said they wouldn't be surprised if DarkSide's computer infrastructure was seized or taken offline by U.S. authorities, and said that Moscow may have tacitly endorsed such an operation.</p><p>\"Historically, significant Russian cyber attacks have had some element of government direction,\" said Sumon Dantiki, a former senior FBI official who specializes in cybersecurity issues at the law firm King &amp; Spalding. \"In contrast, this appears to be an attack on critical infrastructure by a criminal group with the Russian government left to deal with the fallout.\"</p><p>In less than a year, DarkSide had gone from a relative unknown in the growing criminal enterprise of ransomware to one of the biggest and most consequential operators, security researchers say. The group has grown by recruiting \"affiliates\" -- hackers who will penetrate online networks of businesses or public institutions -- with whom it works to disrupt operations. The group splits the ransom money with such affiliates, taking a percentage of the funds, security researchers say.</p><p>DarkSide's criminal efforts brought in at least $60 million in the first seven months of operation, with $46 million of it coming in the first quarter of 2021, according to blockchain research firm Chainalysis Inc. Because Chainalysis has an incomplete picture of all of DarkSide's activities, the ransomware gang's total haul was likely larger, the company said.</p><p>The Colonial pipeline hack marked another major financial score for DarkSide, albeit one that drew significant scrutiny and would have made it difficult to collect payments, according to security researchers</p><p>The shutdown may create challenges for companies who are trying to recover from an infection of the DarkSide ransomware. DarkSide encrypts the contents of victims' computers, making them unusable. But the hackers are promising to provide decryption software at some time in the future, according to their statement.</p>",
