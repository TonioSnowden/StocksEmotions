  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3,989.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIAwas up 69 points, or 0.2%, at 33,819.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite fell 50 points, or 0.5%, at 11,275.</p><p>Stocks rose sharply late last week, with the Nasdaq Composite advancing 9.4% to cement its biggest weekly advance since at least March, while the S&amp;P 500 clinched its best such performance since June.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks were softer heading into Monday afternoon on a choppy day for markets as investors waited to see if last week's rally, inspired by softer than anticipated October inflation data, might still have some more room to run.</p><p>Signs of cooling inflation in Thursday's consumer prices data bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may not need to continue raising borrowing costs at such an aggressive pace.</p><p>The data helped to drive the S&amp;P 500 up 6.5% on Thursday and Friday, the biggest two-day bounce since April 2020, as \"investors far from being positioned for good inflation, and [better] China COVID news, [were] caught with massive amounts of cash on the sidelines,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, pointed out in a note to clients that the inflation report wasn't the only factor that helped set up stocks and other risk-sensitive assets for a rebound.</p><p>\"Impressive levels of European gas storage due to the weather, very short positioning in US equities, mid-terms being out the way, positive seasonals, less event risk in the Russian/Ukraine war, and now softer U.S. inflation than expected are all helping,\" Reid said.</p><p>Also helping the rebound was a sharp rally in some of the worst-hit technology stocks as investors welcomed signs that they may be reining in their profligate spending. Meta was up 1.2% META as it cuts its staff count.</p><p>Looking ahead, technical strategists see the next key resistance level for stocks at 4,100.</p><p>\"The market gapped up cleanly and ferociously through that 3900 level. Now its next test is looming: the 200-day moving average and that downtrend line tracing the previous sequence of highs,\" said Callum Thomas at ChartStorm.</p><p>\"We know the narrative [cooler CPI] that helped it breakout, [it] makes me wonder what story we might tell once its reaches resistance…markets have a habit of finding excuses to do what they are technically ready to do!\" Thomas added.</p><p>Government bond markets were closed Friday for Veterans Day holiday, but government bonds have since resumed trading, with the yield on the 10-year note up 7 basis points at 3.890%.</p><p>Still, stock investors have plenty to be optimistic amount thanks to rhetoric from Fed officials. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard sent stocks higher around midday after she said that the Fed has demonstrated sufficient resolve in its battle against inflation andit may be appropriate 'soon' to step down to a slower pace of interest rate hikes.</p><p>But over the weekend, Fed Gov. Chris Wallersaid investors should \"take a deep breath\"and not put too much stock in a single data point, noting that the end of the rate-hiking cycle is still a ways off.</p><p>\"The burst of euphoria which erupted over U.S. markets and spread more widely at the end of last week is ebbing away after fresh warnings that the fight against inflation is still a hard slog yet to be won,\" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in a morning note.</p><p>\"This latest reminder comes from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, who said at a conference in Sydney that the endpoint to rate increases is likely 'ways off'. The message is coming loud and clear from the Fed – investors should hold their horses when it comes to expectations of looser monetary policy,\" Streeter added.</p><p>Single-market movers</p><p>* Semiconductor stocks are rebounding a bit on Monday. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH is up modestly. Intel Corp. is up 1.3%.</p><p>* Moderna Inc. is up 5.2% after announcing both of its new COVID-19 boostersproduced a better antibody response against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants in a Phase 2/3 clinical than the company's original booster.</p><p>* Chinese tech names are up sharply on more news about COVID-19 restrictions waning. the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB is up more than 2.5%, while shares of Baidu Inc. BIDU and JD.com JDare also up sharply, among other Chinese megacap tech names like Alibaba BABA.</p><p>* Amazon.com Inc. stock slipped after a report suggesting it intends to lay offabout 10,000 corporate and technology workers as economic conditions continue to hit Big Tech.</p><p>U.S. stocks retreat as 'peak inflation' rally stalls</p>",
