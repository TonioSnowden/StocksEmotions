  "text": "<p>Intel issued a downbeat revenue and earnings forecast for the current quarter as coronavirus pandemic lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine combined to hit the outlook for PC sales.</p> <p>The news, which wiped 5 per cent from Intel's share price in after-market trading, came as investors have been looking for clues about whether the surge in demand in the broader chip industry has been starting to weaken. </p> <p>Texas Instruments, one of the most diversified large chipmakers, trimmed its growth forecast this week on concern that some Chinese customers would be forced to suspend operations. </p> <p>Intel, the biggest US chipmaker by revenue, said it expected revenue of $18bn in the three months to the end of June, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $18.4bn. Pro forma earnings are expected to be 70 cents, it added, lower than the market's forecast of 83 cents.</p> <p>However, Intel stuck to its revenue guidance for the year as a whole and Pat Gelsinger, chief executive, said it had “executed well” against the turnround strategy he put in place last year.</p> <p>For the first quarter of the year, Intel reported&#xa0;revenue of $18.4bn, down 7 per cent from a year before, as sales in its PC chip division fell 13 per cent to $9.3bn. Pro forma earnings per share fell 35 per cent on the revenue contraction, to 87 cents. </p> <p>Wall Street had been expecting revenue of $18.3bn and earnings per share of 80 cents.</p> <p>Global PC sales slipped nearly 7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to research firm Gartner, mainly on a drop in demand for lower-priced Chromebooks, which were in high demand during the pandemic.</p><p>Source: Richard Waters in San Francisco 2022 'Intel downbeat as Ukraine war and China lockdowns threaten PC sales' FT.com 28 April.
