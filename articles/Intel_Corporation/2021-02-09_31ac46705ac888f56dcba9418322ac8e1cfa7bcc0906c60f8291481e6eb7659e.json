  "text": "<p>Eli Lilly's chief financial officer has been forced to step down after an internal investigation had revealed “consensual though inappropriate personal communications” with some Lilly employees.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US drugmaker said the probe had been sparked by allegations that Josh Smiley had an “inappropriate personal relationship” with an employee.&#xa0;</p> <p>Smiley, who has been chief financial officer since 2018, will be replaced by Anat Ashkenazi, a senior vice-president who has been controller and chief financial officer of Lilly research laboratories since 2016.&#xa0;</p> <p>David Ricks, Lilly's chief executive, said the company's core values were “integrity, excellence and respect for people”. </p> <p>“We expect all employees to live these values, and we expect exemplary conduct from our executives at all times,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. </p> <p>Lilly said Smiley's conduct was not related to financial controls or statements. He will be available to help with the transition to his successor. Shares in Lilly were flat in pre-market trading in New York.</p> <p>The resignation is the latest sign that large corporations are taking a stricter approach to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4247c24-0147-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47\">relationships at work</a>. The #MeToo movement initially focused on sexual harassment, including illegal acts like Harvey Weinstein was<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d093489e-529e-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"> found guilty</a> of in February 2002. </p> <p>But now many businesses have taken a view that executives should not have office relationships, fearing they are, or could be interpreted as, an abuse of power.</p> <p>Former chief executives of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5006fa50-ff00-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47\">McDonalds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/512b07f6-7553-11e8-aa31-31da4279a601\">Intel</a>, and a former executive at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5700b316-1763-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">BlackRock</a>, were among those who have stepped down after it was discovered they had consensual personal relationships. In 2018, more leaders were removed for ethical lapses than poor business performance, according to a PwC survey of 2,500 companies. </p> <p>Ashkenazi said the company had a “high degree of confidence” in its short and long term outlook. Eli Lilly beat expectations in the fourth quarter, boosted by demand for diabetes and cancer drugs, as well as sales of its Covid-19 antibody treatment. </p> <p>“I look forward to building on this excellent foundation, working closely with Dave and the rest of our talented Lilly team to drive our strategy forward and helping create shareholder value in the years ahead,” she said.</p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in New York 2021 'Eli Lilly CFO steps down after ‘inappropriate' communications' FT.com 9 February.
