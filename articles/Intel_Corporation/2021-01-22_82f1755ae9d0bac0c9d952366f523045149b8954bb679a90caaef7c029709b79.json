  "text": "<p>   The departure of Bob Swan as CEO of Intel (\"Intel's Board Ousts CEO,\" Page One, Jan. 14) should not be a surprise to anybody who understands technology companies. The leader must be a technologist, no matter how bright any other candidate might be. </p><p>   I experienced a similar situation when Intel's Andy Grove decided to retire from day-to-day operations. I refused even to be considered, as my training didn't give me the necessary ability to make the right decisions for the technical future of the company. </p><p>   Intel needs to regain technical leadership, or at least technical parity with TSMC and Samsung -- and the Chinese. Anything that gets in the way of that needs to be pushed aside. Having a board of directors with almost no technologists is wrong and needs changing. </p><p>   In my day, Samsung was used as a contract manufacturer for older chips and was way behind technologically. Intel needs to focus its energy to get back to those days and everything else will follow. </p><p>   Larry Hootnick </p><p>   Watermill, N.Y. </p><p></p>",
