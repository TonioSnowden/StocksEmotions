  "title": "World News:  South Korean Company Gets  Chip-Restriction Exemption  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn",
  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- South Korean memory-chip maker SK Hynix Inc. received a one-year exemption from new U.S. restrictions blocking exports of advanced chips and related equipment to China, a sign of Washington's willingness to offer reprieves that help minimize potential disruption to global semiconductor production. </p><p>   The new rules, which the Commerce Department unveiled on Friday, add new license requirements for advanced semiconductors and chip-making equipment destined for a facility in China. </p><p>   The U.S. has been working to get allies on board with the restrictions and consider enacting similar ones themselves. The rules had appeared to carve out at least one concession to some of those allies: The Commerce Department would review applications for certain exports to U.S. and U.S.-allied facilities operating in China on a case-by-case basis. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned facilities would face a presumption of denial. </p><p>   The timeline for the granting of the licenses wasn't immediately shared, spreading confusion and concern across the semiconductor industry and helping trigger stock-market falls earlier this week for major chip players. </p><p>   On Wednesday, SK Hynix became the first chip maker with production sites in China to publicly acknowledge having received a temporary exemption from the U.S. requirements. </p><p>   SK Hynix said it received a letter from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security that ensures the company can supply its China-based facilities with the equipment and items needed for one year without meeting additional licensing requirements. That allows SK Hynix to continue its memory-chip production in China. The South Korean company didn't specify when the one-year exemption ends. </p><p>   The Commerce Department said the new export-control rule was just released on Friday and that its Bureau of Industry and Security was \"undertaking a vigorous outreach effort to educate those impacted by it, work to implement it, and ensure compliance with it.\" </p><p>   The department said it couldn't comment on company-specific actions, but noted the rules allow for temporary license extensions \"to mitigate supply chain concerns without undermining national security and foreign-policy interests.\" </p><p>   But one critic of the new controls raised concerns that exemptions could undermine the intent of the new rule. </p><p>   \"If Commerce won't limit the opportunities for foreign companies to earn revenue from China sales, it will never do so for American companies,\" said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. \"All these license requirements are just paperwork -- sales to China will only see a brief pause.\" </p><p>   SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory-chip maker by revenue, operates production facilities in the Chinese city of Wuxi. Output there accounts for about 13% of the world's total production capacity for DRAM, one of two major types of memory chips that go in smartphones, PCs and other devices, according to TrendForce, a Taiwan-based market-research firm. </p><p>   SK Hynix also owns Intel Corp.'s NAND flash-memory-chip factories in Dalian through a deal struck two years ago, though the operational transfer is continuing and is expected to be finished in 2025. SK Hynix said its Chinese facilities were exempted but didnt name any facility. Later on Wednesday, Intel said that it received an exemption to continue operating at the Dalian factory. </p><p>   China ranks among the world's biggest markets for semiconductor sales and chip-making equipment. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   John D.
