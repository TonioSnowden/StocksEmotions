  "text": "<p><strong>One big invitation to start: </strong>Join <strong>Elon Musk </strong>and the FT's Peter Campbell today at 6pm GMT/ 1:00pm EST for a keynote discussion and audience Q&amp;A session as part of the FT's Future of the Car summit. <a href=\"https://car.live.ft.com/page/1880197/register-now?reference=ftcuratednewsletters&amp;utm_source=emh&amp;utm_medium=ftcuratednewsletters&amp;utm_campaign=2022PFTFutureoftheCar\">Register here</a> to attend digitally or in-person at The Brewery, London. </p> <p>(DD will be watching to see if the <strong>Tesla </strong>CEO will open up about his mega-deal to buy Twitter, which short seller <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong> has bet will be repriced. More on that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea6016c5-7503-45e2-baf4-493a1ea0ef1f?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">from Alphaville</a>.) </p> <p><strong>And one scoop to start:</strong> <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28877985-a308-4d7b-8b8d-55165a4b7e51\">pulled out of settlement negotiations</a> with <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>'s <strong>GFG Alliance</strong>, forcing the start of insolvency hearings in a UK court on Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the process.</p> <h2>A cloud hangs over private equity dealmakers in LA</h2> <p>The private equity industry has a decidedly bearish outlook for everything . . . except the private equity industry.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebefa5d6-c0a3-4589-8e7a-389d24eed4fe\">Such was the mood</a> at last week's <strong>Milken Global Conference</strong> in Beverly Hills. Dealmakers such as <strong>Apollo</strong> <strong>Global</strong>'s <strong>Marc</strong> <strong>Rowan</strong> said surging inflation, slowing growth and an aggressive <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> would end a decade of near-uninterrupted buoyancy in financial markets. </p> <p>The private equity chief was not alone in his pessimism. </p> <p>“We are coming out of the mother of all happy hours with negative interest rates and massive public spending supporting the economy and reducing risk,” said <strong>Mathieu</strong> <strong>Chabran</strong>, co-founder of <strong>Tikehau</strong> <strong>Capital</strong>. “Now we are all dealing with a massive hangover.”</p> <p>The grim outlooks were unequivocal. Relying on ever-rising stock market multiples to drive profits is over, while financing conditions are also tightening. </p> <p>“It has an early innings feel of a repricing of credit risk,” added <strong>Todd</strong> <strong>Lemkin</strong>, chief investment officer of <strong>Canyon</strong> <strong>Partners</strong>. “The party seems like it will stop, or pause, at least for a little bit.”</p> <p>The current predicament stems from events few could have modelled, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its effect on food and energy prices. Regardless, the issues are not easily solvable.</p> <p>But of course, private equity is not in the business of doom and gloom — particularly when sponsorship fees for the Milken festivities can cost $20,000, or more.</p> <p>Ask any industry chief about their own firm, and they'll tell you that boom times are here to stay.</p> <p>A procession of private equity dealmakers characterised their returns as being better than ever versus public market benchmarks, and were bracing for enormous flows of new cash from retail investors seeking higher returns than their low-fee index funds. </p> <p>“Given the indexation of public markets, we are seeing the alternative firms dramatically expand in size and scale,” said Rowan.</p> <p>It may be wishful thinking. </p> <p>After all, as one prominent dealmaker noted, there are more than a dozen private equity firms trying to close new fundraisings of $15bn or more. Institutional investors have marked down their public portfolios, but not their private equity holdings — making them more overweight to alternatives than ever. It means the money pouring into the private funds could slow to a trickle. </p> <p>Worse, the imbalance also raises the spectre that much of the industry's current “outperformance” is due for its own markdown.</p> <p>The conference named after <strong>Michael Milken</strong>, who popularised the junk bond in the 1980s at<strong> Drexel Burnham Lambert</strong>, served as a reunion for many of the buyout billionaires who can trace their fortunes back to the junk bond powerhouse.</p> <p>It has also morphed into a fundraising bonanza for private equity groups and a sales opportunity for their bankers, who fought fiercely for tables at the <strong>Beverly</strong> <strong>Hilton</strong> and <strong>Waldorf</strong> <strong>Astoria</strong> to host meetings, or held court in their hotel suites. </p> <p>Perhaps the only dealmaker without a sales pitch at Milken was Apollo co-founder <strong>Leon Black</strong>. </p> <p>The private equity group's former chief arrived at 7am on Monday morning to hear his protégé Rowan speak, and was later spotted enjoying a sandwich poolside with<strong> Nelson Peltz</strong>, the billionaire activist investor he once financed as a Drexel banker. </p> <h2>An M&amp;A spree fit for a billionaire</h2> <p>Who's the busiest employee at billionaire tycoon <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>'s <strong>Reliance Industries</strong>? DD can only assume it is the corporate communications staffer who drafts the deals press releases.</p> <p>That's because Reliance has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7859d08d-c3e0-4531-a01e-510abd6b8284\">on a dealmaking tear</a>, making 10 investments and acquisitions worth nearly $1bn altogether in the first quarter of this year as he vies to take on <strong>Gautam Adani</strong>, the billionaire industrialist with one of the country's largest renewables portfolios, who <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/gautam-s-adani/?sref=OziMsGoK\">recently unseated</a> Ambani as Asia's richest man.</p> <p>The M&amp;A blitz is keeping in pace with the $2.3bn the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate spent on deals in 2021.</p> <p>Reliance is following in the footsteps of many fossil fuel legacy companies and diversifying into renewable energy. But Ambani is also intent on growing Reliance's<strong> Retail </strong>and <strong>Jio</strong> technology businesses, and this quarter struck deals for companies ranging from fashion to phone lock-screens.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9774212.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>DD readers will remember the years Reliance burnt cash in an effort to make Jio India's biggest telecoms company, only to prove its doubters wrong and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f1fe4d6-e4e0-11e7-a685-5634466a6915\">upturn the entire industry</a>.</p> <p>It's little wonder then that Reliance now enjoys “absolute carte blanche” from investors “not really paying attention to return ratios in the short term”, as one analyst told the FT's Chloe Cornish.</p> <p>Will investors keep up their support? It has not all been rosy for India's biggest-listed company recently. Reliance had to call off a $3.4bn offer for <strong>Future Retail</strong>, the source of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd628dfe-1e20-45cf-ba6e-950a11ae9e4c\">clash with <strong>Amazon</strong></a>. Results on Friday showed the company's relentless growth continuing, but at a pace which missed analysts' expectations — shares shed 3 per cent in Monday's trading.</p> <p>Yet the M&amp;A press releases may keep coming: the company is plotting a joint bid for <strong>Boots </strong>with private equity group <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, as the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0603d48d-c008-4a76-9d78-74aa72dd0bb3\">revealed</a> last month.</p> <h2>The battle to unseat Arm China's renegade chief</h2> <p>In June 2020, the board of UK chip designer<strong> Arm</strong>'s China joint venture voted to fire its pugnacious chief executive <strong>Allen Wu</strong> because of “conflicts of interest” relating to his <strong>Alphatecture</strong> investment fund.</p> <p>Nearly two years later, the rogue CEO is still refusing to surrender.</p> <p>Wu, who entered the top job in 2018 shortly after the unit's UK parent sold a 51 per cent interest in the Chinese subsidiary to a consortium of local financial investors and Arm partners, has stubbornly clung to power in part by remaining Arm China's legal representative, complicating efforts to force him out under a centuries-old Chinese system.</p> <p>Chinese officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04267443-9b39-4ce3-a7da-65a726fddfdc\">finally agreed</a> to his removal last month, making way for government adviser <strong>Liu Renchen</strong>, Beijing's draft pick for his successor who has spent the last decade helping China gain access to foreign technology and now runs state-backed <strong>Shenzhen Qingyan Technology Transfer Co</strong>.</p> <p>But the transition from power has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48baeb67-2d3c-41c3-8645-e89ac69a985a\">anything but smooth</a>, the FT's Ryan McMorrow and Anna Gross report.</p> <p>Wu's security team first denied the new CEO entry into Arm China's offices, requiring police intervention, then with the office lost, Wu told employees to work from home until further notice, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the events. Control of the IT system means Wu has also blocked emails from the new Arm-backed leadership telling staff to turn on him. </p> <p>The stand-off ended after police descended on Arm's 24th-floor offices in Shenzhen and hauled away two of Wu's guards, but the renegade boss's presence is still known. Wu still holds court over the unit's main offices in Shanghai, where employees are working from home under a Covid-19 lockdown, and last month, 430 Arm China employees signed an open letter backing Wu.</p> <p>Arm finally made some headway on Friday with the defection of the IT head to its side, enabling the UK company to communicate with employees.</p> <p>Gaining control over the renegade Chinese unit will be crucial to plans being drawn up by Arm's owner, Japan's<strong> SoftBank</strong>, to list the UK's biggest technology company in New York.</p> <p>Yet the power struggle rages on. “[Wu] has a team of creative lawyers searching for ways to keep him in power,” said a person close to the board. He may not be able to keep them on Arm China's payroll for long.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Vodafone </strong>has appointed former <strong>Arm </strong>CEO <strong>Simon Segars</strong> and <strong>France Télévisions</strong> president <strong>Delphine Cunci </strong>as non-executive advisers in the face of pressure for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/658e0a26-3f85-4a41-9a0a-2d0379dd974d\">management refresh</a> by activist fund <strong>Cevian Capital.</strong></p></li>  <li><p><strong>Peter Brooks-Johnson</strong>, the chief executive of<strong> Rightmove</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaceeda3-946c-45b7-b242-a5ac208edf89\">is stepping down</a> after more than 16 years at the UK property portal.</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity firm<strong> Astorg</strong> has named former<strong> Natixis Investment Managers </strong>CEO <strong>Jean Raby</strong> as a partner of business development.</p></li>  <li><p>Online home ownership company <strong>Better</strong> has appointed <strong>Harit Talwar </strong>as chair.
