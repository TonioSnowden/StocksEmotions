  "text": "<p>Very true. Watchdogs are jumping in to hand the auto industry regulations and strong guidance (including from the United Nations, of all places) for cyber and privacy matters, creating compliance issues for a sector that didn't have to worry much about such topics not too long ago.</p><p>Read more below...</p><p>Double Down on Protection Against Triple Threat Extortion</p><p>Cybercriminals have a new tactic: triple extortion. This debilitating combination of ransomware, the exposure of stolen data, and DDoS attacks is something all organizations need to prepare for.</p><p>Watch Video</p><p>A U.S. group that coordinates cybersecurity information-sharing in the auto industry is setting up an outpost in Europe to help companies communicate about vulnerabilities and risks. The new European branch of the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center could also relay relevant threat details anonymously with members in the U.S., said Martin Emele, the Auto-ISAC's regional director for Europe.</p><p>The group met last month online to dissect new cyber regulations from the United Nations and European Union, with speakers from Robert Bosch GmbH, Panasonic Corp., BMW AG and Volvo Group among others.</p><p>The global semiconductor shortage has strained the automotive supply chain this year, but a cybersecurity flaw could complicate auto production as well as distribution and sales, depending on when in the cycle it is discovered. Components for car parts are often used by multiple suppliers, meaning a cyber issue could ripple rapidly and broadly.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Advent, Permira near deal to buy McAfee for more than $10 billion. A deal, which would value the cybersecurity company at around $25 a share, could be announced by Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are ongoing and could still fall apart, the people said.</p><p>McAfee, founded in the 1980s, has a complex history. The company returned to the public markets in October 2020 and is part-owned by private-equity firms TPG and Thoma Bravo LP and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. Intel Corp. bought McAfee in 2011 as part of a strategy to move the chip-making giant's technology beyond computers. Intel sold a majority stake in 2017 to TPG, with Thoma Bravo investing then too. Intel still owns a small stake.</p><p>McAfee's shares had risen modestly since the IPO before jumping roughly 20% to close at $25.46 on Friday on news of the potential deal, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg. (WSJ)</p><p>$2.2 Trillion</p><p>Value of mergers in the U.S. so far this year, which is more than double the amount at this time in 2020, according to Dealogic. Security has been particularly hot as more people work remotely and several high-profile breaches affecting consumers and businesses underscored its importance. (WSJ)</p><p>When companies discuss a merger or acquisition, officers get email and other communications from counterparts they might not normally talk to and they exchange data typically kept more private. It's a sensitive period and hackers know it.</p><p>The FBI last week warned that ransomware actors are targeting victims during such financial events. Between March and July 2020, at least three public companies in the U.S. were attacked with ransomware during M&amp;A negotiations, the FBI said.</p><p>Here are some of the FBI's recommendations for protection:</p><p>Back up critical data offline.</p><p>Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external storage device.</p><p>Secure back-ups and ensure data isn't accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the original data resides.</p><p>Use two-factor authentication for user login credentials.</p><p>Use authenticator apps rather than email, as actors may be in control of victim email accounts. And don't click on unsolicited attachments or links in emails.</p><p>Avoid public WiFi.</p><p>â€” Kim S. Nash</p><p>Countdown: Four Senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio, pictured, added an amendment to must-pass defense legislation that would require federal agencies and critical infrastructure companies to report cyberattacks within 72 hours. (ZDNet)</p><p>The amendment, also supported by Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia and Gary Peters of Michigan, says the 72-hour deadline doesn't apply in every case. In a ransomware situation, organizations would have to report the incident within 24 hours of paying a ransom.</p><p>The amendment would also make the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, the primary federal body to respond to attacks on federal civilian networks.</p><p>$50 Billion</p><p>The amount allocated for making infrastructure more resilient to cyberattacks and natural disasters in the $1 trillion public-works bill.</p><p>Oversight Concern. Shareholders of SolarWinds Corp. are suing the networking company's board, accusing current and former directors of knowing about and failing to oversee cybersecurity weaknesses before the attack, discovered in 2020, that spread corrupted software to customers' systems. A SolarWinds representative said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation.
