  "text": "<p>The company posted net income of $4.74 billion, or $1.11 a share, roughly flat with the $4.72 billion, or $1.11 a share, that it reported in the year-earlier quarter. On an adjusted basis, Verizon VZ earned $1.31 a share, up from $1.21 a share a year prior, whereas analysts tracked by FactSet were projecting $1.28 a share.</p><p>Verizon's revenue dropped to $34.1 billion from $34.7 billion, matching the FactSet consensus that called for $34.1 billion.</p><p>Consumer wireless service revenue rose to $14.6 billion in the fourth quarter, marking a 7.7% increase over the year-earlier total. Verizon said the rise captured “ongoing step-ups to unlimited and premium unlimited plans” as well as contributions from its acquisition of Tracfone that closed late last year.</p><p>For the full year, Verizon expects organic service and other revenue growth of about 3%. On a reported basis, including the impact of the company's sale of Verizon Media and its ownership of TracFone, the company anticipates organic service and other revenue growth of 1% to 1.5%.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?

Excluding the impact of its TracFone acquisition, Verizon expects wireless service revenue to increase at least 3%.</p><p>The company models adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.55 for the full year. Analysts tracked by FactSet were projecting $5.36 a share.</p><p>Starting in 2022, the company plans to exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions in its adjusted EPS metric. In 2021, intangible amortization had a roughly 11-cent negative impact on adjusted EPS, and Verizon estimates an impact of roughly 17 cents to 19 cents for 2022.</p><p>The report comes after Verizon and peer AT&amp;T Inc. agreed to limit 5G near some airports amid a dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration. Verizon also was absent from the list of winning bidders on a recent 5G spectrum auction held by the Federal Communications Commission; Verizon had been the largest bidder at the prior major auction, which commanded higher spending.</p><p>Verizon are up 0.7% on a three-month basis, while the SPDR Communication Services Select Sector XLC exchange-traded fund&#xa0;has declined 9.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA&#xa0;has dipped 3.9%.</p>",
