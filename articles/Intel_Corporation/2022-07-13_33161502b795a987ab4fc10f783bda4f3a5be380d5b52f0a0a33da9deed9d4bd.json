  "title": "Twitter's Lawsuit Against Elon Musk: The Main Points; The suit is a rebuttal to complaints by Mr. Musk, and Twitter's lawyers also made a number of accusations of their own",
  "text": "<p>After months of public criticism by Elon Musk against Twitter Inc., the social-media company fired back forcefully on Tuesday with a lawsuit seeking to enforce the billionaire's deal to buy it for $44 billion.</p><p>The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, is by far the fullest rebuttal by Twitter to complaints by Mr. Musk that culminated in his lawyer telling the company on Friday that he intended to abandon the deal he had struck with Twitter's board 74 days earlier. Twitter's lawyers also made a number of accusations of their own about how Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., behaved before and after the deal was struck on April 25.</p><p>Below is a summary of some of the key points Twitter's lawyers lay out in the lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Musk and his legal team didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday. In Friday's letter, his lawyer wrote that Twitter was \"in material breach of multiple provisions\" of the deal and appeared to have made \"false and misleading representations\" when entering into the agreement.</p><p>Who Is Telling the Truth about Fake Accounts?</p><p>Mr. Musk has said wanted to acquire Twitter in part to tackle the presence of spam and fake accounts on the platform. In a statement announcing the merger, he said he would prioritize \"defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\"</p><p>The issue has now become the central reason he has given for trying to walk away from the deal. Mr. Musk has expressed doubt about Twitter's longstanding estimate that less than 5% of monetizable daily active users are spam or false accounts. His lawyer's letter Friday said \"Mr. Musk has reason to believe that the true number of false or spam accounts on Twitter's platform is substantially higher than the amount of less than 5% represented by Twitter in its SEC filings.\"</p><p>Twitter's lawsuit says Mr. Musk made his offer without seeking any explanation regarding its estimates of spam or false accounts.</p><p>From the outset of this extraordinary post-signing information exchange process, Musk accused Twitter of \"lax\" methodologies for calculating spam or false accounts. Knowing that his actions risked harm to Twitter and its stockholders, wreaked havoc on the trading price of Twitter's stock, and could have serious consequences for the deal, Musk leveled serious charges, both publicly and through lawyer letters, that Twitter had misled its investors and customers. But Musk exhibited little interest in understanding Twitter's process for estimating spam accounts that went into the company's disclosures.</p><p>Twitter says that when it \"nonetheless bent over backwards\" to address Mr. Musk's requests, he \"resorted to false assertions that it had not.\" In a June 20 letter, the complaint says:</p><p>Twitter noted that Musk, while continuing to accuse Twitter of misrepresenting its spam or false account estimate, had offered not a single fact to support the accusation. And Twitter observed that defendants' \"increasingly irrelevant, unsupportable, and voluminous information requests\" appeared directed not at consummating the merger but rather the opposite: trying to avoid the merger.</p><p>Who Had Say on Personnel Decisions?</p><p>In Friday's letter, Mr. Musk's lawyer said that Twitter had failed to uphold its obligations in the deal to obtain the tycoon's consent before \"deviating from its obligation to conduct its business in the ordinary course and 'preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization.'\" The letter pointed to a hiring freeze implemented in May along with the departure of two top executives, as well as Twitter's decision last week to lay of 30% of its talent acquisition team.</p><p>Twitter's lawsuit disputes those contentions on several fronts. For one, it says Mr. Musk had no right to review such decisions:</p><p>Twitter specifically negotiated for the right to terminate employees, including executives, without first having to obtain Musk's consent. Musk had notice back in early May of many of the actions about which he now complains for the first time. He did not object then or at any point prior to his purported termination notice on July 8, because there was no violation.</p><p>The suit also argues that the decisions Twitter made \"aligned with Musk's own stated priorities,\" referring in part to conversations he had with Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal:</p><p>Days after signing, on April 28, 2022, Musk texted Twitter's board chair to say his \"biggest concern is headcount and expense growth.\" In a meeting with Twitter management on May 6, 2022, Musk again asserted that the company's headcount was high and encouraged management to consider ways to cut costs. Musk repeated these themes in conversations with Agrawal and Segal throughout May and June. On June 16, Musk held a virtual meeting with Twitter employees. Asked what he was \"thinking about layoffs at Twitter,\" Musk responded that \"costs exceed the revenue,\" \"so there would have to be some rationalization of headcount and expenses.\" In his final conversation with Segal before purporting to terminate, Musk expressed his concern about Twitter's expenses and asked why Twitter was not considering more aggressive cost cutting.</p><p>Hello, It's Twitter. Is Anybody There?</p><p>In its filing, Twitter describes frustration over what it viewed as the lack of any clear point of contact on Mr. Musk's side to hammer out details for part of the time they were working to implement the merger agreement.</p><p>The social-media company said in the filing that, for some time after the deal was inked, it interacted with Bob Swan, the former Intel Corp. CEO, who represented Mr. Musk with an eye to securing financing on the deal. Twitter said it was in touch with Mr. Swan as late as June 20 to arrange a retention program to keep key employees from jumping ship during the transition period.</p><p>But Twitter's suit says it never got a response from Mr. Musk's side:</p><p>Twitter's concern deepened when, on June 23, 2022, Musk texted Twitter management to say that he had asked Swan \"to depart the deal proceedings, as we are not on the same wavelength.\"</p><p>Twitter says it tried to find out who had replaced Mr. Swan:</p><p>Over the ensuing days, Twitter's repeated requests for a contact in lieu of Swan generated no response.</p><p>Eventually Mr. Musk responded to Twitter's CFO, the suit says:</p><p>On June 30, 2022, Musk informed Segal that replacement team member (and long-time Musk confidant) Antonio Gracias would be taking over the financing effort that Swan had helmed. But Gracias never appeared.</p><p>Mr. Swan and Mr. Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners and a former Tesla board member, didn't respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Musk's Tweets About Twitter</p><p>Mr. Musk, in the merger agreement, agreed not to disparage Twitter or its representatives after criticizing the platform ahead of the deal. In the lawsuit, Twitter claims Mr. Musk violated those and other commitments he made to Twitter.</p><p>To spell out its case, Twitter cited the Tesla CEO's numerous tweets about the deal as evidence. Among them: Mr. Musk's assertion made in a tweet that the deal was \"temporarily on hold.\"</p><p>Musk had no basis for asserting that the deal was \"on hold\" based on this longstanding disclosure. Twitter's deal counsel called Musk's deal counsel. Two hours after the \"on hold\" Tweet was published, Musk belatedly Tweeted that he was still \"committed\" to the deal.</p><p>Early on May 13, 2022, in advance of a diligence meeting that had been scheduled to discuss the data Twitter had provided, Musk Tweeted without any advance notice to the company that the \"Twitter deal [is] temporarily on hold\" until the company showed him proof for its estimate that less than 5% of Twitter accounts are spam or false.</p><p>Twitter said Mr. Musk didn't take seriously a confidentiality agreement, citing a May 14 tweet.</p><p>The next day, he boasted publicly that he had violated his non-disclosure obligations;</p><p>Mr. Musk urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to probe Twitter:</p><p>In yet another breach of his non-disparagement obligation and efforts covenants, Musk encouraged the SEC to investigate the accuracy of Twitter's disclosures;</p><p>Money Matters</p><p>The financial picture for Mr. Musk and for the proposed deal has deteriorated since Mr. Musk started buying Twitter's stock in January, in the run-up to his takeover effort.</p><p>Shares in Tesla, which account for most of Mr. Musk's wealth, are down sharply from the all-time high they hit in November, and the outlook has darkened for Twitter and other social-media companies that rely on digital advertising.</p><p>Mr. Musk initially planned to finance the takeover in part through $12.5 billion from margin loans backed by more than $62.5 billion worth of Tesla shares that he owns. He subsequently reworked the financing plan to eliminate that borrowing, pledging more equity financing instead.</p><p>Musk remains personally responsible for $33.5 billion of the approximately $44 billion required to complete the transaction.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, has said he doesn't care \"at all\" about the economics of buying Twitter.</p><p>Twitter's suit argues that Mr. Musk's attempt to withdraw from his agreement, in fact, flows from the changing economic situation:</p><p>Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders. This is in keeping with the tactics Musk has deployed against Twitter and its stockholders since earlier this year, when he started amassing an undisclosed stake in the company and continued to grow his position without required notification. It tracks the disdain he has shown for the company that one would have expected Musk, as its would-be steward, to protect. Since signing the merger agreement, Musk has repeatedly disparaged Twitter and the deal, creating business risk for Twitter and downward pressure on its share price.</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter's Lawsuit Against Elon Musk: The Main Points</p>",
