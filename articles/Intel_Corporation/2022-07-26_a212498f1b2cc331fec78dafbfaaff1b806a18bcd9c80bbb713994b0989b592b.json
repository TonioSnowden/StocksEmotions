  "text": "<p>A $280 billion package of subsidies and research funding to boost U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors and advanced technology is on track to pass Congress.</p><p>The legislation is a result of more than a year of negotiations in the House and Senate. It both appropriates money now to encourage companies to manufacture high-tech products in the U.S., and then directs Congress to spend more money later on items like scientific research.</p><p>A final Senate vote is expected later this week after the legislation drew bipartisan backing, and the bill must be approved by the House, where it needs a simple majority to pass. The bill has been dubbed the Chips and Science Act by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). The Chips part stands for \"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors,\" and the science part adds money for high-tech research. The bill is the end result of separate Senate and House efforts called USICA and Competes, respectively.</p><p>As with many bills that are set to become law, the 1,054-page legislation also has some unrelated items that are jumping onboard. The bill reauthorizes the country's space program and appropriates $20 million to protect Supreme Court justices and their families after recent threats.</p><p>The legislation isn't paid for with a tax increase or other revenue. Lawmakers have said this is a matter of national security, which justifies the additional deficit spending.</p><p>How will the bill encourage companies to develop technology in the U.S.?</p><p>The legislation is set to give semiconductor companies $52.7 billion to encourage them to develop and research semiconductors and chips in the U.S. Already, several companies including Intel Corp. have announced plans to build plants in the U.S., on the condition that this legislation passes.</p><p>Right now, most chips are built abroad, which backers of this legislation say opens the U.S. up to security risks and supply-chain delays. The fund is for technology companies to build, expand or modernize facilities, as well as continue exploration and testing.</p><p>The bill also creates a 25% investment tax credit for companies that invest in semiconductor manufacturing to further incentivize U.S. companies.</p><p>Are there limits in how the companies can use the funds?</p><p>Yes. Recipients of funds from the bill are banned from using the money for stock buybacks or from paying dividends or making other capital distributions. Chinese military entities are also banned from participating in the programs authorized under this legislation.</p><p>It would prevent companies from using subsidies if they also are building or expanding advanced semiconductor manufacturing plants in China or other potentially unfriendly countries.</p><p>Photos: There Aren't Enough Chipsâ€”Why Are They So Hard to Make?</p><p>What else does the legislation authorize?</p><p>The legislation authorizes roughly $200 billion in science and technology research funding for coming years. The directive on research is broad, related to technology from robotics to high-performance computing to semiconductors.</p><p>The money will be spread across many government agencies for research. The largest portion, $81 billion, will go to the National Science Foundation. The legislation creates a Directorate of Technology and Innovation, and other positions, to oversee the spending and programs created by the bill, including the establishment of university technology centers, award scholarships and fellowships to develop the science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.</p><p>How does the research money address diversity in science?</p><p>There are several provisions in the legislation that encourage or require diversity. For example, it would create a Senate-confirmed diversity officer for the National Science Foundation. It directs money to be spent at minority-serving universities and also calls on the NSF to improve science, technology, engineering, and math education in rural communities.</p><p>It also puts a focus on STEM education from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. The legislation directs the National Science Foundation to invest in elementary education programs focused on science and technology, in part to expand the future workforce in the U.S. of people who can work in high-tech industries.</p><p>What restrictions are there on the research money?</p><p>The bill would ban universities with education partnerships with China known as Confucius Institutes from receiving research funds, though there is an ability for the university to receive a waiver if they can meet requirements showing the university has full managerial authority over the institute. Several of these organizations have closed in recent years after scrutiny and worries about national security risks.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What outstanding questions do you have about the new chips bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Will this bill help put a woman on the moon?</p><p>Potentially. The legislation reauthorizes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. The bill instructs the space program to focus on a program known as the Artemis Moon Program, which has a goal of putting people back on the moon. It specifically says to put the first woman and a person of color on the moon. It also extends authorization for the International Space Station through 2030 and says the U.S. should prioritize research required to bring Americans to Mars.</p><p>Why is there money to protect Supreme Court justices in the bill?</p><p>To move the chips bill, lawmakers added it to legislation that had already passed the House. The bill provides about $20 million for security for Supreme Court justices, a response to the threats that they have faced at their homes and in public.</p><p>By attaching the chips and science legislation to the Supreme Court funding, lawmakers could cut down on some procedural time. It also helped the Supreme Court funding pass, given the chips act had momentum from senators to get through Congress. Now, the package goes back to the House.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>What's in the Semiconductor Chips Bill That Congress Is Set to Approve?</p>",
