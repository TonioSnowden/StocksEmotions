  "text": "<p>Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5734058a-e5b5-46e7-8ae2-8a60eda9be7d\">has sued</a> the US National Archives and the congressional committee investigating his involvement in the January 6 siege on the Capitol in an attempt to block the release of his presidential records.</p> <p>The former president filed the lawsuit with the US district court for the District of Columbia yesterday, claiming that nearly 50 documents relating to his presidency could be withheld under “executive privilege”.</p> <p>The lawsuit marks the latest legal scuffle between Trump and House Democrats and sets the stage for yet another courtroom battle for the former president.</p> <p>In the filing, Trump accused the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack of “harass[ing]” him and “senior members” of his administration by “sending an illegal, unfounded and overbroad request to the archivist of the United States”.</p> <p>Trump is not the only official refusing to co-operate with the January 6 committee. Steve Bannon, his former strategist, has rejected a congressional subpoena to provide evidence to the committee, which is expected to meet on Tuesday to consider whether to hold him in criminal contempt.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.</em> <em>Here is the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
