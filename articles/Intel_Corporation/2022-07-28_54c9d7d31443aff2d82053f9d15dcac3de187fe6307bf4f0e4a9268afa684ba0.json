  "title": "Intel Posts Sharp Drop in Sales, Issues Muted Outlook; Revenue decline is the chip maker's biggest in more than a decade",
  "text": "<p>Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said delays in the rollout of a new chip family for data centers and continued supply-chain troubles compounded the PC weakness.</p><p>The results were \"below our expectations, below what we committed to our shareholders,\" he said, adding \"we're quite disappointed by that.\"</p><p>The semiconductor titan posted a net loss of $454 million, compared with a profit of $5.75 billion in the year-earlier quarter.</p><p>Higher interest rates and inflation have hit consumers' pocketbooks around the world, and the return to in-person work has softened demand for PCs that people bought in droves over the past two years to facilitate remote work and distance schooling.</p><p>The Intel division that houses the company's PC chips reported a 25% fall in revenue to $7.7 billion, and its data-center-chip division said sales fell 16% to $4.6 billion.</p><p>The chip-making company said revenue in the current quarter is likely to total $15 billion to $16 billion. Wall Street was expecting sales of more than $18 billion. For the full year, it now expects sales of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from $76 billion. The company maintained its free-cash outlook for the year.</p><p>Intel shares sank more than 10% in after-hours trading following the results.</p><p>The largest U.S. chip maker by sales is having to grapple with other market disruptions. Consumer spending cooled in May in the U.S., according to the most recent government data, and an economic slowdown has been under way since the start of the year. Europe's growth forecast for this year has slowed amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Chinese growth has been hindered by Covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p>PHOTOS: There Aren't Enough Chips - Why Are They So Hard to Make? </p><p>https://www.wsj.com/story/there-arent-enough-chips-why-are-they-so-hard-to-make-3e29c7e0</p><p>PHOTOS: There Aren't Enough Chips - Why Are They So Hard to Make?. PHOTO: Caitlin Ochs for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said the fall in consumer spending would probably ease the global chip shortage that has persisted for two years, though he maintained an earlier forecast that the supply-demand mismatch would stretch into 2024.</p><p>Chip makers less directly exposed to fluctuations in consumer demand have reported stronger results in recent quarters. Pent-up demand for cars, coupled with a shift toward electric vehicles that gobble up more semiconductors than their gas-powered counterparts, helped boost earnings at car-chip maker NXP Semiconductors NV this week. Texas Instruments Inc. on Tuesday also reported results above Wall Street estimates. Alongside their automotive businesses, both companies sell to industrial customers who have been less hard-hit by consumer weakness.</p><p>Intel executives had warned that the second quarter wasn't shaping up as strongly as they initially expected. Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said in June that headwinds for the business were \"much worse than what we had anticipated coming into the quarter.\"</p><p>Sales in Intel's datacenter business fell because of inventory reductions, lower pricing and competitive pressure, the company said. Its perennial rival in central processing unit sales, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has gained significant market share in server chips in recent quarters.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said the company would grow more slowly than the rest of the datacenter chip market for the next year or two.</p><p>The turmoil comes as Intel is trying to remake itself under Mr. Gelsinger. Since taking the reins last year, Mr. Gelsinger has set an ambitious course for Intel to regain a technology edge on other chip producers that surpassed it in the race to make the fastest chips with the smallest transistors.</p><p>He's also trying to turn the company into a major contract chip maker, producing semiconductors for others. That business, which recently signed up Taiwanese smartphone-chip maker MediaTek Inc. as a customer, aims to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. in an arena where Intel in the past has struggled to gain a foothold.</p><p>A centerpiece of that strategy is a campaign to expand Intel's manufacturing footprint, with help from governments around the world that increasingly see chip-making as a national-security priority. Intel plans to open new chip-making plants in Arizona, Ohio and Germany.</p><p>The chip maker is aiming to help finance its factory-building ambitions by bringing in outside investors, Mr. Zinsner said Thursday, adding that the company was still firming up the investment structure. The outside investors—infrastructure investment specialists such as Brookfield Asset Management Inc. or Blackstone Inc.—would have noncontrolling but potentially significant equity stakes, he said.</p><p>\"The bigger picture there is we are in a capital-intensive phase of our turnaround,\" Mr. Gelsinger said. He added that the strategy was about finding ways to leverage other pools of capital to invest aggressively but maintain a healthy balance sheet.</p><p>In the U.S., the company also is banking on government incentives to lighten the financial load of that expansion, including money from a $52 billion industry investment bill that passed in the Senate on Wednesday. Intel has said the pace and scale of its Ohio project is contingent on federal incentives, and it delayed a groundbreaking ceremony set for this month as the funding legislation remained in limbo.</p><p>The House on Thursday joined the Senate in approving the spending plan that now goes to President Biden, who is expected to sign it into law.</p><p>Intel now plans to go ahead with a groundbreaking ceremony at the Ohio plant, Mr. Gelsinger said. \"We'll be throwing a party in Ohio soon,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Posts Sharp Drop in Sales, Issues Muted Outlook</p>",
