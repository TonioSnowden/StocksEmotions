  "title": "PayPal stock heads for longest losing streak on record; analyst says it's ‘overly punished'",
  "text": "<p>The stock PYPL is off 1.2% in afternoon trading, and were down 16.3% over a nine-session span. If the stock finishes the day in negative territory, it would notch its longest losing streak on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>While fintech shares more generally have been swept up in the recent market rout that's punished high-growth names, some of PayPal's pain is “self-inflicted,” according to Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev. He mentioned PayPal's reported interest in a Pinterest Inc. PINS acquisition last October, which prompted some questions about the company's ability to hit user-growth targets on its own. (PayPal later said it was not pursuing a Pinterest deal at the time.)</p><p>Read: Fintech's ugly month of losses may offer a ‘fantastic opportunity' to bargain hunt, say analysts</p><p>PayPal also delivered a disappointing outlook in its most recent quarterly report last November. The company is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 1, after the closing bell.</p><p>But Dolev argued that PayPal shares, which have been cut almost in half from their all-time intraday high of $310.16 reached in July, are being “undeservedly punished” by the market—at least partially. He thinks that investors are hammering the company for “poor e-commerce checkout trends,” but he's more optimistic, citing an expanding and favorable spread of total-payment-volume growth versus 2019 levels, relative to Visa Inc.'s V e-commerce volumes.</p><p>Other financial-technology stocks took hits Tuesday, including restaurant-software provider Toast Inc. TOST (down 6.0%), buy-now pay-later operator Affirm Holdings Inc. AFRM (down 3.5%), and bill-payment software maker Bill.com Holdings Inc. BILL (down 3.4%). Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX lost 0.8%.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?

Shares of American Express Co. AXP are up more than 9% after the company topped earnings expectations on the back of record card spending and gave a rosier long-term outlook than it had previously offered.</p>",
