  "title": "Bausch  Prices  IPO at  Low End  Of Target  ----  By Corrie Driebusch",
  "text": "<p>   Bausch + Lomb Corp. priced its IPO at $18 a share Thursday, falling short of expectations as it became the first big company in months to try going public into a turbulent stock market. </p><p>   Bausch Health Cos., the parent company, raised $630 million in the offering. It had been aiming to raise as much as $840 million and sell the stock at $21 to $24 a share, according to a regulatory filing. </p><p>   The debut of the eye-care company, a spinoff of Bausch Health Cos., is being watched closely as a bellwether for the IPO market, which has been virtually shut down since stocks started falling earlier this year. </p><p>   It is the first big initial public offering since private-equity firm TPG Inc. went public in mid-January. </p><p>   After a record year in 2021, traditional IPOs have raised less than $3.3 billion in 2022, the slowest start since 2016, according to Dealogic. </p><p>   Bausch is a fitting test case for the IPO market, which provides a crucial spigot of cash and visibility to startups and Wall Street alike. The company is profitable and a well-established name. </p><p>   \"It's a real critical week for the IPO market,\" said Jeff Zell, senior research analyst at IPO Boutique. </p><p>   With so few IPOs so far this year, \"it's extremely important that this one not only gets out on the right foot but trades steady in the aftermarket,\" he said. </p><p>   Among those who will be watching closely are others on the IPO runway. </p><p>   Fund managers say they have met this year with executives at companies including Intel Corp.'s $50 billion-or-more self-driving car unit Mobileye and Steinway Musical Instruments Holdings Inc., which have said they are pursuing IPOs. </p><p>   Other companies considering listings this year include ServiceTitan Inc. and Quick Quack Car Wash Holdings LLC, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   It doesn't help that markets have whipsawed lately, with the technology-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite up more than 3% Wednesday and down 5% Thursday. </p><p>   The index has moved at least 1% in either direction in 11 of the past 13 trading sessions. </p><p>   Traditionally, volatility has been considered the most crucial indicator for the IPO market. </p><p>   When a company launches its IPO, the management team and its advisers spend several days on a roadshow, meeting with fund managers to entice them to buy the stock. A volatile market, with little visibility into the next day let alone week, makes that tricky. </p><p>   There has been another, less well-appreciated factor gumming up the gears of the new-issue market, bankers say. </p><p>   Correlation between individual stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has risen dramatically in recent months as fears that rising interest rates could spark a recession lead to across-the-board selling. </p><p>   That makes it harder for stock pickers and makes IPOs less attractive, some analysts say. </p><p>   Fund managers expect outperformance from IPOs, and if stocks are nearly all moving in unison, the odds of achieving that become longer. </p><p>   Over the three months before technology stocks started falling in December on inflation and interest-rate fears, the average stock moved in the same direction as the S&amp;P 500 39% of the time, according to Ned Davis Research. Since then, that has jumped to 61%. </p><p></p>",
