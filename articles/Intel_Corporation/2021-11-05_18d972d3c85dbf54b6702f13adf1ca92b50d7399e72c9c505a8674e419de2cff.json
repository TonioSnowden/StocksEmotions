  "title": "Advent, Permira Near Deal to Buy McAfee for More Than $10 Billion; A deal for the security-software company could be announced by Monday; talks are ongoing",
  "text": "<p>McAfee, which returned to the public markets in October 2020, is part-owned by private-equity firms TPG and Thoma Bravo LP and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. Intel Corp. bought McAfee in 2011 as part of a strategyto move the chip-making giant's technology beyond computers. Intel sold a majority stake in 2017 to TPG, with Thoma Bravo investing then too. Intel still owns a small stake.</p><p>McAfee's shares had risen modestly since the IPO before jumping roughly 20% to close at $25.46 on Friday on news of the potential deal, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg.</p><p>John McAfee founded the business in the 1980s. He left the company in 1994 and later moved to Belize. Mr. McAfee made headlines in 2012 after he fled to Guatemala to avoid police seeking to question him in connection with the suspected murder of his neighbor. Mr. McAfee, who maintained his innocence, was eventually deported to the U.S., and Belize declined to request his extradition. He died in a Spanish jail in 2021 and at the time of his death planned to appeal an extradition order to the U.S. in connection with federal tax-evasion charges.</p><p>Deal making has been booming, with companies striking $2.2 trillion worth of mergers in the U.S. so far this year, more than double the amount at this time in 2020, according to Dealogic. Much of the activity has come from private-equity firms, which have been putting record amounts of money to work, especially in the technology sector, which got a boost from increased demand during the pandemic. Software companies in particular have become magnets for buyout firms, with their steady and predictable cash flows.</p><p>Security has been particularly hot as more people work remotely and several high-profile breaches affecting both consumers and businesses underscored its importance. Earlier this year, NortonLifeLock Inc. agreed to buy cybersecurity firm Avast PLC for more than $8 billion and Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy RiskIQ, a small company founded in 2009 that helps companies track their vulnerability to digital threats.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com, Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com</p><p>Advent, Permira Near Deal to Buy McAfee for More Than $10 Billion</p>",
