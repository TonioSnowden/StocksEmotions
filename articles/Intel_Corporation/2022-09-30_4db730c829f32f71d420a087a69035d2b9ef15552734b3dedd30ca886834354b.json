  "title": "Intel Drives Forward With Mobileye Self-Driving Car Unit's IPO Plans; Listing plans come during a difficult year for the IPO market",
  "text": "<p>Sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have sent shock waves through the stock market, putting the IPO market on pace for its worst year in decades.</p><p>Intel acquired Israeli company Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has previously said the listing Mobileye would give the unit a higher profile and ability to attract more business. Intel, he said, doesn't need the money Mobileye's public listing would generate.</p><p>Another company pressing ahead with IPO plans, Instacart Inc., said it doesn't plan to raise much capital in the public offering.</p><p>Intel will retain a large stake in Mobileye, including all of the Class B shares the Mobileye plans to issue, according to the filing. Each Class B share will have voting rights equivalent to 10 Class A shares.</p><p>Mobileye, with around 3,100 employees, said it had revenue of $854 million for the first six months of its fiscal year, up 21% from the year-earlier period. The company had a loss of $67 million, it said in the disclosure.</p><p>Amnon Shashua, the founder and chief executive of Mobileye, said in the filing that he supported the sale to Intel \"to accelerate Mobileye's transition from a world leader in driver assistance systems to a leading enabler in the evolution of autonomous driving solutions. Together we accomplished that goal. Now it is time for the next chapter.\"</p><p>Mobileye said it expected its driver-assistance systems to be deployed in 266 million vehicles in 2030 based purely on agreements it had in hand around midyear.</p><p>Chip companies more widely are betting that the auto sector, which is embracing more semiconductors as vehicles add features such as enhanced driver-assistance technology. Qualcomm Inc. Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala this month said the company expects to grow automotive revenue to around $4 billion in about four years from $1.3 billion estimated for the current fiscal year. The figure should reach around $9 billion early next decade, he said.</p><p>Mobileye said it applied to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol MBLY.</p><p>The push to move forward on the IPO comes at a difficult time for Intel. The company's earnings have been under pressure from a slump in the PC and smartphone market.</p><p>Intel also is investing heavily to expand its chip-production capacity, with more than $100 billion in investment plans announced since Mr. Gelsinger took the top job early in 2021. Intel last month struck an unusual $30 billion funding partnership with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. to help finance its factory-expansion ambitions.</p><p>Write to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Drives Forward With Mobileye Self-Driving Car Unit's IPO Plans</p>",
