The end is in sight,\" Conger said.</p><p>The so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation pressures — came in roughly in line with economists expectations, while a more modest 1.2% gain in private wages and salaries in the third quarter was interpreted as a sign that wage growth may have finally peaked, according to Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>See: GDP looked great for the U.S. economy, but it really wasn't</p><p>Corporate earnings remained front-of-mind for investors this week, although disappointing numbers from some of America's largest tech companies helped to sully the overall quality of S&amp;P 500 earnings this quarter.</p><p>Last night, Amazon.com AMZN joined Microsoft Corp.

META by publishing disappointing earnings for the quarter that ended Sept. 30.</p><p>Shares of Amazon fell 11% in premarket trading after e-commerce giant, which dominates the consumer-discretionary sector, predicted slower holiday sales and profit while also reporting slower growth in its key cloud-computing business.</p><p>Opinion: The cloud boom has hit its stormiest moment yet, and it is costing investors billions</p><p>Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said investors were unnerved by Amazon's guidance cut.</p><p>\"The outlook for Q4 was what terrified investors with the retailer guidance operating income in the range $0-4 billion vs est. $4.7 billion and revenue of $140-148 billion vs est. $155.5 billion,\" he said.</p><p>One notable exception to the downbeat earnings news this week was Apple Inc. AAPL , which proved a bright spot after the iPhone maker's revenue and earnings topped forecasts, helped by record back-to-school sales of Macs. Shares were up nearly 0.9% in premarket trading.</p><p>Also on the economic data calendar, the final reading of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for October and five-year inflation expectations — also closely watched by the Fed — are due at 10 a.m. Eastern, alongside pending home sales for September.</p><p>Higher Treasury yields added to the headwinds facing stocks on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up 7.5 basis points to 4.017%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rose 3.2 basis points to 4.371%.
