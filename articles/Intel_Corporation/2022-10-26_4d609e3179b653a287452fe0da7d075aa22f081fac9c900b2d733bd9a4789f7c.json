  "text": "<p>Intel paid $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye in 2017, and was reportedly aiming for a valuation as high as $50 billion when originally planning this IPO, but instead will settle for a basic valuation of roughly $16.7 billion. After a record year with more than 1,000 offerings in 2021, the IPO market has largely dried up in 2022.</p><p>Read: Mobileye IPO: 5 things to know about the Intel autonomous-driving spinoff</p><p>Underwriting banks — Intel listed two dozen underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley MS— have access to an additional 6.15 million shares for overallotments, which could push the total raised higher than $1 billion and make Mobileye the second-largest offering of the year. Only two offerings thus far this year have raised at least $1 billion — private-equity firm TPG Inc. TPG raised exactly $1 billion in January, and American International Group Inc. AIG spinoff Corebridge Financial Inc. CRBG raised at least $1.68 billion in September.</p><p>Intel will receive the bulk of the proceeds of the offering — after promising to make sure that Mobileye has $1 billion in cash and equivalents, the chip maker will take the rest of the proceeds for its own coffers. Wells Fargo analysts calculated that Mobileye will need about $225 million to hit that level, leaving at least $736 million for Intel before fees and other costs.</p><p>Intel will also maintain control of the company after spinning it off, keeping class B shares that will convey 10 votes for each share while selling class A shares that convey one vote per share. Intel will retain more than 99% of the voting power and nearly 94% of the economic ownership of the company, and the Mobileye board is expected to include four members with ties to Intel, including Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger serving as chairman of the board.</p><p>Read also: Intel files for Mobileye IPO, creating a share structure that will keep the chipmaker in control</p><p>Mobileye will continue to be led by founder Amnon Shashua, who served as chief executive before Intel acquired the company and stayed at the helm while it was part of the Silicon Valley chip maker. Shashua founded Mobileye in 1999 and turned it into a pioneer in the field of automated-driving technology and one of Israel's most prominent tech companies.</p><p>Mobileye filed for the initial public offeringat the end of September, when executives were still reportedly hoping for a $30 billion valuation.</p><p>Mobileye prices IPO above targeted range to raise nearly $1 billion, and most of it will go to Intel</p>",
