  "text": "<p>Two recent Indian deals involving venture-capital-backed startups show what the country can offer investors.

In the first eight months of 2021, companies have announced mergers and acquisitions worth more than $1.8 trillion in the U.S. and more than $3.6 trillion globally, according to data provider Dealogic.
