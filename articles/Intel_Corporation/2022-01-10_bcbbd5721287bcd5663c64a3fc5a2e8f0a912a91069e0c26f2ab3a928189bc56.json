  "title": "Intel Recruits Micron Executive as Next Finance Chief; David Zinsner will join the chip maker, as Intel said the head of its client computing group is leaving at the end of the month",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Bryant has had a high-profile run at Intel, a company he joined in 1992. He presented Intel products at this month's CES technology show in Las Vegas. He is leaving for a new opportunity, Intel said.</p><p>The chip company tapped Michelle Johnston Holthaus, its executive vice president and general manager of the sales, marketing and communications group, as his successor. The group she will now oversee generated $30.38 billion in revenue in the nine months ended Sept. 25, 2021 and netted $40.06 billion in 2020.</p><p>The personnel changes come about a year after Intel said Pat Gelsinger would take over as chief executive after a series of missteps by the company. Mr. Gelsinger has since tried to fast-track Intel's turnaround, including with a commitment to invest heavily in chip manufacturing and a pledge to return the company to a position of producing the world's best chips.</p><p>Ms. Johnston Holthaus will transition to her new role in the coming months and Intel will search for a new person to head its sales, marketing and communications team.</p><p>Mr. Zinsner, Micron's finance chief, will join Intel next Monday. He had been with memory-chip maker Micron since February 2018. Before that, he was the president and chief operating officer of 5G specialist Affirmed Networks, which Microsoft Corp. acquired in 2020. He also served as the senior vice president of finance and CFO at both Analog Devices Inc. and Intersil Corp.</p><p>Micron said Monday that it has launched a search for its next finance chief and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana has assumed the additional role of interim CFO.</p><p>Intel previously said CFO George Davis planned to retire in May but will remain with the company in an advisory capacity.</p><p>Write to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Recruits Micron Executive as Next Finance Chief</p>",
