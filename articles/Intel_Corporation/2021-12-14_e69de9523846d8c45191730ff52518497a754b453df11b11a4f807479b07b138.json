  "title": "Dell's New Laptop Is Repairable, Reusable, Low-Carbon—and Not for Sale; Laptop maker says its latest circular-economy prototype cuts greenhouse-gas emissions roughly in half compared with a recent model",
  "text": "<p>Dell said Tuesday it is testing new materials, designs and manufacturing processes in a prototype laptop, called Concept Luna, with input from chip maker Intel Corp. Dell says the prototype laptop results in roughly half the greenhouse-gas emissions of its late-2019 Latitude 7300 Anniversary Edition, which was the company's most sustainable laptop when work on the concept began. The motherboard is a quarter of the size, and disassembling, repairing and reassembling key components takes around 18 minutes versus 105, Dell says.</p><p>The company's product teams are already considering the ideas, but it will take years for features to find their way into its electronics. A modular keyboard design, for instance, could be used in existing product lines in two or three years, according to Page Motes, head of global sustainability at Dell.</p><p>More companies are espousing the idea of circularity—decoupling growth from new resource consumption through recycling, reuse and repair. Examples include IKEA's furniture buyback program and Royal Philips NV refurbishing medical equipment for resale. Apple Inc. said this year it would launch a self-repair program for newer iPhones in early 2022.</p><p>It is an uphill struggle. Waste from electrical equipment is increasing around 3% a year and a large majority of it doesn't get recycled, according to WEEE Forum, a nonprofit group.</p><p>\"E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world,\" Ms. Motes said.</p><p>One big challenge for companies is a lack of agreed-upon standards for circularity that would enable companies to report on their progress in a comparable way, Ms. Motes said. Dell is part of the Circular Electronics Partnership, a group of companies working to develop standards.</p><p>Another hurdle is behavior. Ms. Motes said companies need to create a cycle, with enough customers returning old products to provide a stream of raw material for new or refurbished electronics.</p><p>\"There are too many people having a lot of devices sitting in a drawer,\" Ms. Motes said. \"They are having a hard time letting go of the unit itself, much less any pieces, parts.\" She said Dell is researching and testing ways of changing people's habits around disposing of old tech.</p><p>Ms. Motes said circularity is an easier pitch for corporate customers because they see the potential for it to help them achieve their environmental goals.</p><p>\"Our customers are getting very, very interested in how we are proceeding in this area,\" she said. \"We feel the pressure and we know we've got to continue to perform.\"</p><p>According to technology consulting firm Accenture PLC, the circular economy could generate $4.5 trillion of additional economic output by 2030. For Dell, the benefits include the potential to reduce costs and generate revenue through reused materials, Ms. Motes said.</p><p>To date, Dell says it has recovered more than 2.3 billion pounds of used electronics and made over 100 million pounds of recycled parts. It also charges corporate clients to recycle and resell their out-of-use technology.</p><p>The company plans to select circular materials and processes that can be scaled at the same cost or less than noncircular alternatives, Ms. Motes said.</p><p>The circularity \"Nirvana,\" Ms. Motes said, would rely upon traceability and data collection far beyond what exists. Companies such as Dell are still figuring out how a fully circular business model could be achieved, and what it would look like in practice, she said.</p><p>In that situation, \"you know where that material came from, you know where it is going, you know when it is coming back and you know generally what's going to happen with it,\" she said. \"For a circular business to be effective, you have to know where you are in that cycle in any given time, which is incredibly complex. But it is hard to say you're circular if you can't have data to show it.\"</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Dell's New Laptop Is Repairable, Reusable, Low-Carbon—and Not for Sale</p>",
