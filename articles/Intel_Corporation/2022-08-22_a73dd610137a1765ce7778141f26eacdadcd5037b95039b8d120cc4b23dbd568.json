  "text": "<p>Though the media are aghast at the prospect of Giorgia Meloni becoming Italy's next prime minister, the parliamentary elections on September 25 will reinforce the hallowed principle of popular sovereignty — the proposition that the ultimate authority of the state resides with the people (“The new face of the radical right is on display in Italy”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2a52e4b-d320-4b9e-9d9d-7d6136d1f278\">Opinion</a>, August 19). </p> <p>As modern polities go, the “seed of Aeneas” is a serious republic with a sophisticated, well-educated electorate.</p> <p>And the notion that Italians cannot be entrusted to elect their own leaders — a belief held by more than a few in Brussels — is as repugnant as it is anti-democratic. </p> <p>Yes, Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia party (Brothers of Italy) is decidedly rightwing, but the party's fealty to Atlanticism, a market economy and the EU remains rock-solid. Moreover, unlike her coalition partner Matteo Salvini, whose Lega Nord began as a secessionist northern movement, the Brothers of Italy is genuinely nationalistic. Whereas the Lega's founder, Umberto Bossi, was once convicted for insulting the Italian flag, Meloni fervently embraces the tricolore.</p> <p>As for the spectre of Il Duce, Meloni is no modern-day Mussolini. Despite the commentariat's rhetoric about a resurgence of the blackshirt ethos, there are no squadristi anywhere on the Italian peninsula. </p> <p>Fascism in Italy has long since been cast into the ash-heap of history. Indeed, as Ben Hall notes “it would be a stretch to say the Brothers are a fascist party”.</p> <p>More importantly, a victory for Meloni's coalition might prove a game-changer in Italian politics. Should her rightwing alliance secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority, Meloni and co. could bring about the creation of a directly elected presidency via a constitutional amendment.</p> <p>Plus, if she ascends to Palazzo Chigi, Meloni would be the Italian republic's first female premier, underscoring a major feminist triumph.</p> <p><strong>Rosario A.
