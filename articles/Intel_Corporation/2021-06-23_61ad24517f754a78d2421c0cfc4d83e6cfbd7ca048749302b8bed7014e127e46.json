She has written <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd10b02b-0857-44eb-9d1f-5a029d4ed5e1\">a global history</a> of remarkable depth, imagination and insight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0674244214?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0674244214\"><strong>The Horde</strong></a><strong>: How the Mongols Changed the World</strong><br>by Marie Favereau, <em>The Belknap Press £23.95/$29.95</em></p> <p>In medieval European times, the Mongols ruled a vast area of the Eurasian landmass stretching as far to the west as modern Ukraine. Favereau, a French specialist on nomadic empires, achieves the exceptional feat of writing about this era in a way that is accessible to general readers as well as scholarly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0300245645?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0300245645\"><strong>The Volga</strong></a><strong>: A History of Russia's Greatest River</strong><br>by Janet M Hartley, <em>Yale University Press £25</em></p> <p>Hartley's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc1dc365-3a5f-4cf2-8b9c-37a25397b9ff\">study of the Volga</a>, the river that symbolises Russian identity, is a worthy companion to her 2014 book <em>Siberia: A History of the People</em>. She is particularly good on the way that Russians and non-Russians interacted in the centuries after Ivan the Terrible's conquest of Kazan and Astrakhan in the 1550s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0691182655?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0691182655\"><strong>The Spectre of War</strong></a><strong>: International Communism and the Origins of World War II</strong><br>by Jonathan Haslam, <em>Princeton University Press £30/$35</em></p> <p>Anyone interested in global tensions in the interwar period will learn much from the latest book by Haslam, a Princeton University historian. He draws on a lifetime of expertise on the Soviet Union and Russian foreign policy to explain how fear of communism permeated international relations after 1917.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0197525792?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0197525792\"><strong>The Movement</strong></a><strong>: The African American Struggle for Civil Rights</strong><br>by Thomas C Holt, <em>Oxford University Press £14.99</em></p> <p>The Republican party's efforts at voter suppression since the 2020 US presidential election give a special resonance to Holt's book on the civil rights movement of the mid 20th century. It is a concise, lucid and well-balanced account by one of America's best historians of the topic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0750996226?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0750996226\"><strong>Blood and Iron</strong></a><strong>: The Rise and Fall of the German Empire 1871-1918</strong><br>by Katja Hoyer, <em>The History Press £14.99</em></p> <p>The themes of political fragility, social cleavages and pervasive militarism give a convincing coherence to Hoyer's tightly written <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b257bb76-aa06-49d6-b98a-521fd8819e2e\">narrative of German history</a> between 1871 and 1918. She is rightly sceptical of the once fashionable idea that Germany was on a “special path” that distinguished its development from that of Britain, France or the US.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786330997?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1786330997\"><strong>The Anglo-Saxons</strong></a><strong>: A History of the Beginnings of England</strong><br>by Marc Morris, <em>Hutchinson £25</em></p> <p>The foundations of the English state and identity were laid in the seven centuries between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the Norman Conquest of 1066. Morris avoids the mythmaking that once marred histories of this period and composes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c623818d-0470-4edf-9e9c-8961200b39e9\">a lively narrative</a> that is perceptive and well-researched.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1509546596?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1509546596\"><strong>The Scent of Empires</strong></a><strong>: Chanel No 5 and Red Moscow</strong><br>by Karl Schlögel, translated by Jessica Spengler, <em>Polity £20</em></p> <p>Fragrant perfumes are not odours one normally associates with the defunct Soviet Union. Schlögel, a German historian best known for <em>Moscow 1937</em>, a brilliant study of life under Joseph Stalin's Great Terror, has broken unusual ground by writing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9da7f175-63e8-49ce-804c-27618fc3d735\">a comparative history</a> of Soviet and French perfume-making.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1784741000?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1784741000\"><strong>Napoleon</strong></a><strong>: A Life in Gardens and Shadows</strong><br>by Ruth Scurr, <em>Chatto &amp; Windus £30</em></p> <p>Exactly 200 years after his death, it might seem an impossible challenge to write something new about Napoleon Bonaparte, but Scurr has managed it. The Cambridge historian examines the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dae7b6c2-bde8-4ca3-be77-ad8053299bdb\">French emperor's interest in the natural world</a> in a book that is stimulating and highly original.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/024130086X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=024130086X\"><strong>The Partition</strong></a><strong>: Ireland Divided, 1885-1925</strong><br>by Charles Townshend, <em>Allen Lane £25</em></p> <p>The Brexit referendum campaign of 2016 and subsequent controversies over Northern Ireland's status illustrate how political struggles on the British mainland risk dividing and destabilising the province. Townshend, a leading scholar of modern Irish history, has written <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c64d1fba-96c5-406c-8d70-221c6aa1617b\">an authoritative study</a> of the origins of Ireland's partition.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Tony Barber 2021 'Summer books of 2021: History' FT.com 23 June.
