  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Heard on the Street:  Intel Puts a Price on  Its Leap of Faith  ---  The chip maker marks 2025 as its comeback year,  but first comes a sharp rise in capital spending  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Intel Corp. had two basic questions to answer at its long-awaited analyst meeting Thursday: How bad? And for how long? </p><p>\n  A hint about the first one came in the chip maker's third-quarter report nearly four months ago, when Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger warned that Intel's gross margins would fall into the 51%-53% range as the company races to catch up its manufacturing technology while also building a new foundry business that makes chips designed by other companies. </p><p>\n  Thursday's meeting shed more light on the matter as Intel projected a substantial increase in its capital spending levels over the next few years and said free cash flow would drop into negative territory this year. For context, Intel hasn't burned cash over the course of a fiscal year since at least 1990, which is as far back as data compiled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence goes. </p><p>\n  As far as duration, Intel expects to climb out of its \"investment phase\" by 2025. That is when the company expects both spending to moderate and annual revenue to be growing in the low-double-digit range. The latter would be an impressive achievement given the 6% annual revenue growth averaged over the past five years. </p><p>\n  The near-term outlook won't come as much of a shock. Wall Street already was projecting a sharp drop in gross margins and free cash flow through 2024, along with sharply elevated capital spending, according to consensus projections from FactSet. </p><p>\n  And Intel's timing is at least good, with geopolitical instability and the global chip shortage creating a ripe opportunity for an American chip maker looking to expand domestic production capacity. Mr. Gelsinger and Intel's new chief financial officer, David Zinsner, both spent Thursday's meeting discussing the company's \"smart capital\" strategy, in which spending is at least partially offset by government subsidies and customers willing to pay early to lock in production capacity. Other chip companies are cashing in on the same trend. GlobalFoundries, a contract chip maker Intel reportedly tried to buy last year, said in its fourth-quarter call last week that it has secured more than $3.2 billion in long-term customer agreements. </p><p>\n  Intel has still set an ambitious task for itself, with little precedent. The company's position as one of the world's largest producers of a key technology product that is very hard to make gives the business a lot of resilience. The stock fetches just 14 times forward earnings, though -- a 35% discount to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- precisely because investors are unsure if Intel can claw back its highly profitable technological edge. The odds are good that it can, but investors will have to settle in for a long wait to find out. </p><p></p>",
