  "text": "<p>“And the prize for outstanding contribution to network security goes to . . . Mr White Hat”</p> <p>The hacker who stole more than $600m in cryptocurrencies this month continued to earn plaudits from his victim on Tuesday, as Poly Network <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1786cb08-54d3-46f0-b2ae-cca6704b8495\">mounted a charm offensive </a>to recover the $235m in crypto assets he is still holding.</p> <p>Poly called on Mr White Hat to transfer the “keys” — or alphanumeric strings — to the account holding the other tokens “as soon as possible”. It offered a handful of sweeteners, including the opportunity for the hacker to become its chief security adviser and renewed an offer to provide a bounty totalling half a million dollars. </p> <p>The hacker has claimed to be an ethical attacker — a so-called “white hat” who looks for weaknesses in computer networks to improve them, rather than being motivated by money. In case you missed it, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee970452-02de-4d66-84a1-f2b1345f57d1\">read our weekend account</a> of this crypto caper. </p> <p>“We are grateful for Mr White Hat's outstanding contribution to Poly Network's security enhancements,” Poly said on Tuesday. The decentralised finance (DeFi) project now has control back of about $330m of the stolen assets, while stablecoin operator Tether has frozen $33m worth pending a legal process.</p> <p>Meanwhile, wireless operator T-Mobile has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d72327f8-a7f4-4aa9-9d8c-d81cf3de40f3\">personal information of almost 50m</a> current and former customers has been “stolen” in what it described as a “highly sophisticated cyber attack” on its systems.</p> <p>“Unauthorised individuals” accessed data including names, birth dates, social security numbers and drivers' licence information on 7.8m existing customers and more than 40m former or prospective customers, the carrier said.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Google's new AI search tool</strong><br>Google recently flipped the switch on a powerful new search tool — a large-scale AI model known as MUM that can act like a virtual research assistant as it sifts the web for solutions to complex questions. But, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a78997a7-ad25-40b9-b723-55db143e26db\">as Richard Waters reports</a>, critics warn it could “internalise” search traffic and keep internet users locked in a Google universe.</p> <p><strong>2. Netflix's fresh European challengers</strong><br>Comcast and ViacomCBS have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0499c17-af48-488e-b789-7a68d27f95f7\">joined forces to take on Netflix</a> and other streaming services in several European countries, with plans to launch a new video on-demand platform on the continent. The subscription service, to be named SkyShowtime, will unite content from the US companies' brands including Paramount, Universal and Nickelodeon.</p> <p><strong>3. Tencent bucks crackdown</strong><br>Tencent warned investors that more regulatory changes would impact China's tech sector, as it reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f337e55-b1e8-4f28-a4e4-173c6e315667\">a jump in second-quarter profits</a>, bucking expectations that the social media, gaming and fintech group would already be damaged by the moves. Net profit rose 29 per cent year on year to Rmb42.6bn ($6.6bn), well ahead of analysts' estimates of about Rmb34bn.</p> <p><strong>4. Covid and lack of chips cripple manufacturing</strong><br>Covid-19 is disrupting plans by Apple, Google, Amazon and others to shift production from China to Vietnam, according to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/COVID-slows-Apple-and-Google-production-shift-away-from-China\">this exclusive</a>&#xa0;in Nikkei Asia reported by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea40a67f-eb2a-40a4-ab7a-d26095a413e6\">today's #techAsia newsletter</a>. Meanwhile, China's largest private carmaker Geely Auto is the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae4d6fc3-31bc-49fa-a097-493e2fe67bef\"> latest industry player to warn</a> of continued “uncertainty” around production because of chip supply shortages.<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5fc6c9-ca2b-496c-9783-b47bf060769d\"> Kathrin Hille comments</a> for Global Insight that only Huawei is suffering among Chinese tech companies from the US barring access to semiconductors.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>5. Remittance fintechs herald payments revolution&#xa0;<br></strong>Fintech start-ups are finally getting traction in their&#xa0;mission to disrupt banking. Remittances, smaller cross-border payments between individuals, have been an excellent entry point, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f11b38b-54d6-451c-ba4b-48843efa329d\">according to our Big Read</a>.
