  "text": "<p>The deal discussions, which picked up pace in recent days, come roughly six months after computing pioneer Dell Technologies Inc. spun off its 81% equity stake in VMware.</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported on the talks.</p><p>VMware has a strong position in the market for \"hybrid\" cloud, where large companies mix public cloud services like those of Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. with their own private networks.</p><p>Broadcom, a semiconductor powerhouse built largely through acquisitions, has been on the hunt for a deal to beef up its presence in the corporate-software market.</p><p>It came close to buying the closely held software company SAS Institute Inc. last year before SAS's founders had a change of heart.</p><p>Its first big foray into software was its roughly $19 billion acquisition of CA Technologies in 2018.</p><p>The demand for cloud computing, which enables customers to rent computing horsepower rather than invest in their own, has exploded in recent years.</p><p>Startups and other businesses that couldn't support in-house IT departments were among the earliest cloud adopters, but now companies across nearly every industry rely on cloud services.</p><p>Dell completed the spinoff of its VMware stake in November. VMware shareholders, including Dell, got an $11.5 billion cash dividend. Dell used the funds to pay down debt and said the deal positioned it to grow in new markets.</p><p>Michael Dell, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive, remained chairman of VMware.</p><p>VMware is roughly a year into a new regime after company veteran Raghu Raghuram took over following the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, who left to run Intel Corp.</p><p>VMware is set to report earnings Thursday, while Broadcom is set to report earnings next week.</p><p>A market downturn that has sent stock prices lower has made it harder to strike deals and finance them.</p><p>Deal volume is down roughly 25% so far this year compared with last year, according to Dealogic.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.'s roughly $75 billion acquisition of videogame heavyweight Activision Blizzard Inc. registers as the largest of 2022 so far.</p>",
