  "text": "<p>   What's the latest? Your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>   Gossip, the thread of whispered conversation and conjecture that once flowed through the workplace, has dwindled in our new network of home offices and half-empty headquarters. Detached from many of our work friends, forced to type out most of our thoughts, we're finding that gossiping feels risky, weird and hard. </p><p>   Serendipitous run-ins with colleagues from other departments by the coffee machine -- Did you hear what happened in sales? Did you know she's leaving? -- have been replaced by formal Zooms with little time for chitchat. Hybrid work schedules mean even when we're in the office, many others aren't. Stuck on calls with the same five teammates, sometimes it feels like there's simply no new information to be had. </p><p>   \"We already know what everybody has to say,\" says Joe Labianca, a management professor at the University of Kentucky's Gatton College of Business and Economics. </p><p>   The rosy and righteous among us might say good riddance. And surely at some employers there's now less drama, and more time for whatever we were hired to do. But there's a lot we miss. In a recent survey of 504 employees and business owners by law firm Seyfarth Shaw, the top thing people reported longing for after a year of remote work was \"in-person and 'grown-up' workplace conversations.\" </p><p>   \"We need to do it,\" says Dr. Labianca, who studies gossip, which researchers define as two people speaking evaluatively about someone who's not there. Dr. Labianca expands the concept to include rumors, like the threat of layoffs. </p><p>   It gets a bad rap, but gossip can relay positive news, like when you pass along that a co-worker crushed it at a presentation. It also provides stress relief and intellectual stimulation, helps us gain influence and fosters interpersonal intimacy. </p><p>   \"You hear the surface story and then you learn what the real story was, and that's the gossip,\" says Gawain Kripke, an advocacy and policy consultant in Washington, D.C. Such chatter has helped the 53-year-old connect the dots on everything from why a vendor landed a contract to colleagues' career ambitions. Back in the office, body language was usually a crucial part of the exchange, key to establishing trust. </p><p>   Now it's fair to wonder whether your co-worker is grimacing or smirking under that mask as you spill the tea. Those trickling back to the office say the vibe is just different these days. How does one share a particularly juicy tidbit discreetly while abiding by social distancing? </p><p>   \"You're not leaning in to whisper about something,\" says Rachel Lee, who started commuting back into the nonprofit where she works in the Seattle area four days a week last fall. Before the pandemic, colleagues from all different departments would come to chitchat during their breaks. Gathering context about things like past restructurings calmed her anxieties. </p><p>   Now, Ms. Lee can go a half day without seeing anyone. She often feels as if she's going into meetings without really knowing how others in the organization feel about proposals and projects. </p><p>   Gossip is an early-warning system, says Nancy Halpern, a New York City-based leadership consultant who helps executives navigate office politics. The verbal undercurrent also serves to counter any overly upbeat or sanitized formal corporate communications coming from on high. </p><p>   \"People suspect that in the C-Suite or in the senior offices they're making plans that impact other peoples' lives that they don't really know about,\" Ms. Halpern says. \"Gossip is a counterinsurgency.\" </p><p>   Information can flow in the other direction, too. As a CEO, Julie Peck has found that folks aren't exactly plopping down in front of her desk, spilling their feelings. She's long relied on a handful of tapped-in people at the companies she's led to bring her that intel. At a business she ran in Houston, it was a longtime executive assistant. </p><p>   \"Everybody trusted her with their deepest, darkest secrets,\" Ms. Peck says. It was the executive assistant who absorbed feedback from the rest of the staff and then divulged the upshot to Ms. Peck: People feared her. The feedback spurred Ms. Peck to bake cookies for the staff and host employee roundtables, where she developed a more casual, close rapport with workers. </p><p>   Now leading Vcheck Global, a due diligence and background-investigation company that's been working remotely during the pandemic, Ms. Peck sometimes sees shoots of her old in-person gossip networks sprouting up on Slack channels. </p><p>   Others have forged new one-on-one connections in this strange, unifying moment, and managed to gossip via phone or screen -- sometimes even finding it easier than back in the office. </p><p>   Of course, workers broadcast gossip digitally at their own peril. Robyn Pickering, a geochemistry lecturer at a Cape Town, South Africa university, has been invited to private chat rooms on Zoom calls that aim to mimic the gossipy postmeeting debrief that would often bubble up as folks walked out of a conference room. But the threat of accidentally dropping a juicy private message into the public chat box looms. </p><p>   \"It's terrifying to me,\" she says. </p><p>   Known for keeping a stash of chocolate cookies and tissues in her office for tete-a-tetes, she misses the camaraderie with colleagues and students. And yet it took a pandemic for her to realize how much time all the conversations were taking. As a single parent to two young children, she's been shocked by how much she's gotten done at home. </p><p>   \"I was actually very productive,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
