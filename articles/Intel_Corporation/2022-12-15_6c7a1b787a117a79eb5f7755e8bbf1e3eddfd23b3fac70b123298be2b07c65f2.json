  "text": "<p>Hello, everyone! This is Cheng Ting-Fang from Taipei. I just got back from a reporting trip to Arizona, where the world's biggest chipmaker announced it is tripling its investment in the Grand Canyon State.</p> <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is building a $40bn chip plant in northern Phoenix, in part as a response to concerns over chip supply chain vulnerability.</p> <p>I experienced my own supply chain issues during the trip. When I tried to buy a MacBook charger at a local BestBuy (I had forgotten to bring mine), it took me five minutes just to find someone who could point me in the right direction, and another 10 minutes to find a shop assistant with the key to open the case containing the chargers and cables. In Taipei, this all would have taken less than five minutes.</p> <p>In the meantime, my luggage was stuck in Seattle, where I had changed flights to Phoenix. The airline explained it was “short of hands,” making it difficult to transfer baggage for flights with a short connection window.</p> <p>Like electronics retailers and airlines, chipmakers are struggling to fill vacancies as they expand production in the US. For Bertrand Loy, CEO of chip material maker Entegris, the issue of hiring can even determine where his company builds new factories. “We have to make sure we have access to talent,” Loy told Nikkei Asia.</p> <p>A labour crunch is just one of the challenges the tech industry has grappled with in 2022. The war in Ukraine, global inflation and China's zero-Covid policies are others.</p> <p>At the start of the year, most tech companies were upbeat in their outlook, even as they raced to secure chips amid an unprecedented shortage. But after a volatile 12 months, the watchword for the industry in 2023 is “uncertainty.”</p> <p>“Doing business is no longer just doing business. You have to consider politics, you have to take the geopolitical environment into account,” a tech industry executive told Nikkei Asia. “It's totally different than in the past and adds challenges to making any business decision.”</p> <p><em>This is the final #techAsia newsletter of 2022. We will be back with our first edition of 2023 on January 5. Have a safe and happy holiday season!</em></p> <h2>Samsung's strength</h2> <p>Apple has a reputation for precision supply chain management, but the iPhone maker might be able to learn a thing or two from Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest smartphone maker by shipments, Nikkei's Norio Matsumoto writes.</p> <p>An exclusive teardown of Samsung's latest model, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 foldable smartphone, done by Nikkei and Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, reveals that the South Korean giant uses about<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Electronics/Samsung-foldable-smartphone-teardown-reveals-50-local-parts?\"> 50 per cent local content</a> in its phones.</p> <p>The teardown underscored Samsung's prowess in components — it makes the memory chips and OLED displays used in Fold 4, while compatriot LG Energy Solution provides the batteries.</p> <p>While Apple and other manufacturers are diversifying their supply chains to minimise geopolitical risks, Samsung is benefiting from its strong domestic procurement, which ensures stable supplies of parts and helps keep costs down. According to the teardown, the cost of components for the Fold 4 is just 40 per cent of its selling price, beating Apple's latest iPhone in this key profitability metric.</p> <h2>Growth after zero-Covid</h2> <p>Beijing's streets are deserted this week as omicron charges around the country following a sharp reversal in China's zero-Covid policy. Behind closed doors, consumers are logging on to the food delivery app Meituan and bargain shopping platform Pinduoduo to secure essentials, write the Financial Times' Eleanor Olcott, Nian Liu and Ryan McMorrow.</p> <p>The two groups<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/073444d9-990e-47ef-95c9-645819dcf54c\"> have benefited</a> from China's pursuit of zero-Covid, as people stayed home rather than venture out into public spaces or brave the tangled web of restrictions on domestic travel. Combined, the two companies raked in Rmb11.8bn ($1.7bn) in profit during the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>Meituan and Pinduoduo also increased sales by 28 per cent and 65 per cent year on year, respectively, beating the country's tech giants. During the same period, Tencent's revenues declined while Alibaba's grew by just 3 per cent.</p> <p>But as China sheds its pandemic-era restrictions, both groups are trying to secure future revenue streams: Meituan through its travel and Yelp-like restaurant directory service and Pinduoduo through Temu, a Shein-like fast fashion app targeting western shoppers.</p> <p>Neither company is likely to maintain the same breakneck growth but they plan to reinvest the profits that emerged during the lockdowns to secure their future in new post-pandemic ventures.</p> <h2>A heated issue</h2> <p>South Korea's semiconductor industry is like rice, according to South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol. Like the staple food, it is essential for the country's survival.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/South-Korea-s-chip-ambitions-threaten-big-environmental-toll\">local communities</a> are concerned about survival of a different kind, writes Steven Borowiec for Nikkei Asia. Manufacturing semiconductors requires huge amounts of water to clean wafers and cool machinery. This water must be thoroughly treated before it is released to remove various chemicals and heavy metals.</p> <p>Farmers and fishermen in Pyeongtaek, near the site of Samsung's — and the world's — largest chip plant say they are worried about the environmental impact of this waste water. The sheer volumes involved, they say, mean even treated water can lead to dangerous build-ups of chemicals. By 2030, an estimated 1mn tons of wastewater from chip factories will be released into the public waterways of Pyeongtaek.</p> <h2>Comeback combo</h2> <p>Japan has big plans to reclaim its place in the global chipmaking world. Rapidus, a company set up with support from the government and top companies such as Toyota, NEC and Sony, aims to produce ultra-advanced 2-nanometer chips by 2027.</p> <p>Now it has recruited an international ally in the form of IBM to help achieve that <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Japan-recruits-IBM-to-regain-lost-decade-in-semiconductor-tech\">chip renaissance</a>, Nikkei Asia's Ryosuke Eguchi. The US company and its Japanese peers were once among the world's leaders in semiconductor technologies, but they gradually dropped out of chip manufacturing as they struggled to keep up the massive investments needed to stay competitive.</p> <p>IBM, which exited chip manufacturing in 2014 but retained its chip design capability, developed a prototype 2-nm chip last year using a new architecture. Under the deal with Rapidus, the Japanese company will license this technology to develop and mass produce chips.</p> <p>The smaller the nanometre size, the more advanced and powerful those chips are. The global chip leaders — Samsung, Intel and TSMC — all aim to produce 2-nm chips by 2025. Catching up with them, Rapidus President Atsuyoshi Koike acknowledged, will be a challenge: “It won't be easy to make up for 10 to 20 years' worth of delays,” Koike said.</p> <h2>Suggested reads</h2> <ol>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/257b39c4-f146-41ae-af75-dfea955ff462?\">Export controls hit China's access to Arm's leading-edge chip designs </a>(FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Data-curbs-from-Vietnam-to-Indonesia-to-hit-trade-by-up-to-9-study\">Data curbs from Vietnam to Indonesia to hit trade by up to 9%: study</a> (Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/India-s-Mahindra-plans-1.2bn-plant-to-accelerate-EV-push\">India's Mahindra plans $1.2bn plant to accelerate EV push</a> (Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7aabf066-1cc7-4eee-a963-f863bdbbb08c\">US to add Chinese chipmaker to trade blacklist</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/China-targets-likes-in-deepening-crackdown-on-online-dissent\">China targets ‘likes' in deepening crackdown on online dissent </a>(Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89710723-8d41-4b36-87da-d84f2fe12dfd\">SoftBank-backed Paytm launches $103mn share buyback plan </a>(FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd5c19b7-6b55-4788-92b6-55e04a11d717\">Japanese tech leaders warn Beijing will ride out US chip sanctions</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Asia-s-development-banks-must-set-standards-for-smart-technologies\">Asia's development banks must set standards for smart technologies </a>(Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4eaedee4-5267-4e3a-b9da-5d2bb6f356ee\">China hits back at US chip sanctions with WTO dispute</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-security-law/Hong-Kong-condemns-Google-s-handling-of-protest-anthem\">Hong Kong condemns Google's handling of protest anthem </a>(Nikkei Asia)</p></li> </ol> <p><em>#techAsia is co-ordinated by Nikkei Asia's Katherine Creel in Tokyo, with assistance from the FT tech desk in London.<br>&#xa0;</em><br><em>Sign up </em><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/member/register/newsletter/?utm_campaign=GL_techAsia&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=NA_newsletter&amp;utm_content=article_link&amp;del_type=5&amp;pub_date=20220512160000&amp;seq_num=__SEQ__&amp;si=__MERGE__user_id__MERGE__\"><em>here</em></a><em> at Nikkei Asia to receive #techAsia each week.
