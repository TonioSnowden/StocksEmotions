  "text": "<p>What did benchmarks do?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA climbed 422.67 points, or 1.2%, to close at 34,988.84, after gaining as much as 482 points at its session high.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 69.40 points, or 1.6%, to end at 4,471.07.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 348.84 points, or 2.5%, to finish at 14,139.76.</p><p>All three benchmarks finished higher for the first time in four sessions.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow fell 172 points, or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP fell fractionally.</p><p>What drove markets?</p><p>Stocks rose onTuesday as investors read recent developments in Western Russia as indication of a de-escalation in animosities, even as U.S. President Joe Biden cautioned that an attack by Russia of Ukraine was still seen as imminent.</p><p>Following a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow was ready for talks with the U.S. and NATO on limits on missile deployments and military transparency. Earlier Interfax reported the Russian Defense Ministry as saying that units of the southern and western districts are returning to base after completing military exercises.</p><p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow's calls for continued diplomacy were cause for a measure of optimism, “but so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” Reuters reported.</p><p>“The Kremlin's February 15 decision to pull back a few Russian troops andto offer more talks with NATO does not change the fact that their troopscontinue to mass around Ukraine on three sides, including from Belarus, aRussian ally,” said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a note Tuesday.</p><p>Read:Biden urges Russia to ‘choose diplomacy' over Ukraine as he calls invasion still possible</p><p>NATO penalties could be “significant” should Putin go ahead with an invasion, Christopher said, citing the potential for sanctions that might aim to isolate Russia's economy.</p><p>“There is little direct trade between Russia and the world outside of Europe, so both the sanctions on Russia and damage to sentiment likely will fall squarely on the European economies,” said Christopher. “Our conviction is that any Russian invasion should favor U.S. equities and a broad-based commodity exposure.”</p><p>Read:‘Take advantage of this pullback,' says Morgan Stanley executive who sees buying opportunities amid Russia-Ukraine tension</p><p>While markets breathed a sigh of relief over the potential easing of geopolitical belligerence, investors still have been digesting the likelihood of a series of interest rates rises by the Federal Reserve, likely starting in March, to combat inflation, which has risen to a 40-year high.</p><p>The latest update on U.S. inflation at the producer level did nothing to quell worries. The January producer-price index showed a 1% monthly rise, double the 0.5% increase expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The increase in wholesale prices over the past year, slowed a tick to 9.7% from 9.8%, which was the biggest advance in the index since it was configured in 2009, and one of the fastest rates since the early 1980s.</p><p>“Investors have been looking for some signs of easing, but early stage price pressures [are] gaining further momentum and likely to exacerbate near-term market volatility,” said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, in emailed comments.</p><p>In other data, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index edged up to 3.1 in February, after a surprise negative 0.7 reading in January. Economists had expected a stronger rebound to a reading of 10, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Need to Know: This is what it will take to drive the S&amp;P 500 beyond 5,000 this year, say global fund managers</p><p>The “repricing of central bank expectations is the key driver of a good deal of the recent volatility,” said Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer of Credit Suisse. “The geopolitical tensions, however, namely the escalation of tensions between NATO and Ukraine on the one side and Russia on the other, are less predictable, complicated and more difficult to price for markets.”</p><p>An armed conflict could lead global stock markets to drop more than 10%, he said.</p><p>Read:What a Russian invasion of Ukraine would mean for markets as Biden warns Putin of ‘severe costs'</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Marriott International Inc.
