However, the Senate is not due to reconvene until Tuesday, a day before the inauguration of Joe Biden. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, has signalled he will not reconvene the upper chamber early, setting the stage for an impeachment trial in the early days of the new Biden administration. </p> <p>Democrats, who will assume control of the Senate on January 20, need a significant number of Republican senators to abandon the president in the trial to reach the two-thirds majority required to convict Mr Trump. </p> <p>Mr McConnell, who has privately clashed with Mr Trump in private over the past four years but rarely rebuked him in public, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d8cc87-6166-4808-8508-c064fe9332ef\">held open the possibility</a> that he would vote to convict the president in an impeachment trial.</p> <p>Meanwhile, concerns of extremist attacks at Mr Biden's inauguration led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb6e209a-d0f3-4b76-9d88-70bd92dc4976\">dramatic tightening of security</a> in Washington DC.
