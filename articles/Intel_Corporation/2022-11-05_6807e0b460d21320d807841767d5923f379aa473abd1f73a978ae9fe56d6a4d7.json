  "text": "<p>Pfizer predicts a pipeline of promising drugs will inject new life into its sales. The drug company raised its revenue projection for the year, even as overall demand for its Covid-19 shot declines. Sales fell 5.8% in the third quarter due to an 87% drop in its vaccine sales outside the U.S. Pfizer said. Over the next 18 months, Pfizer expects to receive regulatory approvals for new products or additional indications for existing products, including a vaccine for a common respiratory virus and a treatment for the hair loss condition known as alopecia. Pfizer shares increased 3.1% Tuesday.</p><p>UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>UBER +12%</p><p>Uber is picking up speed. The ride-hailing giant announced revenue and adjusted earnings gains as its customers spent more on rides and food delivery. Despite inflation and recession concerns, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is still seeing strong demand for rides even from its customers in lower-income groups. Meanwhile, growth has cooled in recent quarters for the company's food-delivery arm, Uber Eats, which saw surging business during the pandemic as Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions limited in-person dining. Uber shares soared 12% Tuesday.</p><p>QUALCOMM INC.</p><p>QCOM -7.7%</p><p>Demand for semiconductor chips is powering down. That was the message from Qualcomm as the mobile-phone chip supplier gave a bleaker-than-expected sales outlook while slashing its smartphone shipment forecast. Other chip makers are also pulling back. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. predicted a further drop in sales, while Intel Corp. is cutting costs and beginning targeted layoffs. Qualcomm shares fell 7.7% Thursday.</p><p>PARAMOUNT GLOBAL</p><p>PARA -12%</p><p>Tom Cruise couldn't save Paramount's bottom line. The media company on Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter profit on higher costs. Paramount added 4.6 million subscribers to its namesake streaming service Paramount+, and its film business saw a 48% jump in revenue as \"Top Gun: Maverick\" continued its theater run and was released digitally. But its traditional TV offerings saw a 5% decline in revenue. Increases in political advertising spending failed to counteract a decline in viewers and the effects of a stronger dollar. Paramount shares plunged 12% Wednesday.</p><p>ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.</p><p>HOOD +8.2%</p><p>Robinhood is showing it can dodge some arrows. The online brokerage posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, cutting losses after a steep drop in expenses helped offset declining revenue and lower user numbers. Robinhood's September monthly active user count fell 35% from a year ago, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2020. Robinhood is struggling to keep the investors it signed up earlier in the pandemic. The company is also paring expenses, and has made two rounds of layoffs this year. Robinhood shares gained 8.2% Thursday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -3.1%</p><p>The outlook for the tech industry got bleaker. Amazon.com said it will freeze hiring for months across its corporate workforce. Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. and payments company Stripe Inc. both announced major layoffs. Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green said the company would cut 13% of staff, and Stripe outlined layoffs that will target 14% of staff. The stream of news came as the Federal Reserve has moved again to raise interest rates to combat inflation, signaling greater risk of a recession. Amazon shares declined 3.1% Thursday.</p><p>STARBUCKS CORP.</p><p>SBUX +8.5%</p><p>Starbucks is staying hot. The coffee giant said its sales hit a record in its most recent quarter, as consumers maintained their appetite for its drinks despite higher menu prices. What cut its profits was a planned multimillion-dollar investment in new cafe equipment and higher wages, a revamp designed partly to resolve frustrations among baristas. Interim CEO Howard Schultz said Starbucks's investments are beginning to pay off, with employee retention and speed of service improving. Starbucks shares rose 8.5% Friday.</p>",
