  "title": "Intel's New Compliance Chief Navigates Geopolitics, Supply-Chain Shift; Carol Tate was appointed CCO this year. The chip maker faces a period of political tension and an increasingly challenging economic environment.",
  "text": "<p>Intel in the third quarter posted a 20% drop in sales and lowered its full-year outlook. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger in October said the company was beginning to make targeted job cuts, although he wouldn't specify how many.</p><p>The company this year announced plans to build new chip plants in Ohio, Germany and elsewhere, as part of its strategy to downsize its manufacturing footprint in Asia by as much as 30% by the end of the decade. The approach comes as the U.S. government has taken several steps to try to maintain America's technological edge over China, including by placing stricter restrictions on semiconductor-industry exports. Lawmakers in July also passed the Chips and Science Act, which extends nearly $53 billion in subsidies for research and development and to build or expand chip plants in the U.S.</p><p>\"We are at the center of the U.S. regaining technology leadership, and providing balance in domestic manufacturing,\" Ms. Tate said. \"It's an exciting time to lead a global team with a company that's at the center of those things.\"</p><p>Ms. Tate spoke with Risk &amp; Compliance Journal about the supply-chain shift, layoffs and other topics. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>WSJ: What role does compliance play when it comes to these massive geopolitical pressures around the chip industry?</p><p>Ms. Tate: We partner with Intel's international trade group, particularly around export controls and sanctions. The critical role that we play in that partnership relates to how our technology is being used in the marketplaceâ€”from how we design products to when they're actually in the marketplace, looking at how third parties use them.</p><p>The geopolitical environment in which we find ourselves means that we, from a compliance perspective, really need to be keenly focused on how what we do in one part of the world may affect what we do or say or what our business operations are in another part of the world.</p><p>WSJ: How does Intel go about making sure its technology is being used in a way that aligns with the company's values?</p><p>Ms. Tate: One of the things that we maintain is a public-facing global human-rights principles policy. In 2019, we augmented that policy with respect to product responsibility. The policy says that where we become aware of a third party that is using Intel products to violate human rights, we will restrict or terminate business with that third party until such time that we have high confidence that that's not the case.</p><p>The way in which we've been implementing that is by talking to our customers about their compliance programs, about how they're mitigating the risk of Intel products being used in ways that they allegedly harm or interfere with human rights. At times, we've been very successful at helping customers or some multinational corporations in evolving and maturing their compliance programs with respect to product responsibility.</p><p>WSJ: What does Intel do to manage third-party risks, including bribery, human rights and ESG, without duplicating efforts across the company?</p><p>Ms. Tate: We collaborate extensively with supply chain-oriented organizations, including the Responsible Business Alliance and its responsible minerals initiative. Leveraging and really dialing up and dialing into those alliances and relationships and memberships has been a critical part of the evolution of how we think about compliance in that respect.</p><p>Also, data. Using data within any company is always challenging. You have lots of systems, many of which don't talk to one another, and we're no different. But leveraging data within the company to get smarter about identifying potential issues before they become problems has been an area of focus.</p><p>WSJ: Can you give us an example of how you're using data in the supply-chain area?</p><p>Ms. Tate: One example of a way in which we've used data and artificial intelligence is a tool that was created in the past couple of years within our company. We refer to it as CRIS [compliance risk intelligence system]. It's still nascent, but it's one of the innovative, creative tools that's been developed in order to help identify the potential corruption risks associated with high-risk transactions.</p><p>I specifically mention that tool because it brings in data from a number of different sources within the company and looks at over 20 risk factors. It really has a yield that allows us to look at not only an overarching sales transaction for potential corruption risks, but also specific elements of that sales transaction that might seem problematic. It allows us to pinpoint much more quickly in the life cycle of any deal potential issues that we can then go review.</p><p>WSJ: How are the layoffs affecting the compliance function and how have you adapted to this challenge?</p><p>Ms. Tate: We're certainly, like many other companies, going through this very challenging time and finding ways to be more efficient and more effective. That includes cost-cutting and that impacts employees.</p><p>When the dust settles, compliance will be looking at how these cost-cutting measures have impacted our governance structure. We will be looking at who has changed roles, what roles are no longer here, what decisions have been made in terms of how we will service our clients, and ultimately how all of that impacts our risk profile.</p><p>Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com</p><p>Intel's New Compliance Chief Navigates Geopolitics, Supply-Chain Shift</p>",
