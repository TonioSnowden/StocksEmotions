  "text": "<p>   SINGAPORE -- Intel Corp. removed references to the Chinese region of Xinjiang from an open letter it sent suppliers last month, after the contents of the note sparked a social-media uproar in China and led the U.S. semiconductor company to apologize to the Chinese public. </p><p>   In mid-December, Intel published a letter to its global suppliers on its website, calling on its business partners to avoid sourcing from the northwestern Chinese region, where the Chinese government has conducted a campaign of forcible assimilation against ethnic Muslim minorities. </p><p>   Within days, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company was denounced by Chinese social-media users and state-run media for cutting business dealings with the region, while one of its China brand ambassadors pulled out in protest. The chip maker apologized on Dec. 23 on its Chinese social-media accounts, adding that the letter was written to comply with U.S. law and didn't represent its position on Xinjiang. </p><p>   A Wall Street Journal check of the same webpage and supplier letter on Jan. 10 found that the company had erased any reference to Xinjiang there. Previously, Intel had written in the letter viewed on Dec 23: \"Our investors and customers have inquired whether Intel purchases goods or services from the Xinjiang region of China. Multiple governments have imposed restrictions on products sourced from the Xinjiang region. Therefore, Intel is required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.\" The Jan. 10 version didn't carry that wording. </p><p>   Intel said on Monday that the company had \"recently issued a statement in China to address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network.\" Intel said in Monday's statement that it would continue to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where it operates. </p><p>   The move drew a rebuke from Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) \"If companies like Intel continue to obscure the facts about U.S. law just to appease the Chinese Communist Party then they should be ineligible for any funding under the CHIPS Act,\" he said in reference to legislation to provide funding for the semiconductor industry in the U.S. </p><p>   Intel declined to comment on the senator's statement. </p><p></p>",
