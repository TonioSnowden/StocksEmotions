  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Gains-Tax Talk Hits Stocks  ----  By Joe Wallace and Amber Burton",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks dropped on news reports that President Biden is considering nearly doubling capital-gains taxes on the wealthy. </p><p>   Mr. Biden plans a capital- gains tax increase to as high as 39.6% on the wealthiest Americans, an increase from the current 20%, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. </p><p>   Major indexes wavered between small gains and losses for much of the session before tumbling on the headlines. The S&amp;P 500 fell 38.44 points, or 0.9%, to 4134.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 321.41 points, or 0.9%, to 33815.90. The Nasdaq Composite slid 131.81 points, or 0.9%, to 13818.41. </p><p>   All 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 traded lower on the report. Technology and other growth stocks were some of the biggest losers. Shares of Micron Technology, Twitter and Western Digital dropped more than 4%. </p><p>   The planned tax increase is far from a surprise, but the fall in stocks was a knee-jerk reaction, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at PrudentialFinancial. </p><p>   \"Even though this is not a surprise -- the expectation that capital gains would be taxed at a higher rate -- it becomes more immediate and there's a hitch in the market,\" she said. \"This isn't new. It has not been a question of if or when, it has just been 'how much?'\" </p><p>   Elsewhere, investors continued to parse through another batch of earnings reports and data on the labor market. Many investors remain upbeat about the outlook for stocks but are growing concerned that a surge in coronavirus cases globally could delay plans to reopen economic activity. </p><p>   \"It wouldn't take much news for [investors] to start ripping up their reopening playbook,\" said Christopher Jeffery, head of inflation and rates strategy at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \"The market has gone from a world of not questioning it to starting to question it,\" he said, adding that his team is following the rise in cases in Michigan closely. </p><p>   Earnings season continues apace. </p><p>   Shares of Equifax jumped $28.78, or 15%, to $221.41 after the credit-reporting firm late Wednesday raised financial projections for the year and said it expects to buy back more than $100 million in stock. </p><p>   Blackstone Group shares climbed $2.65, or 3.3%, to $82.96 after the private-equity firm swung to a record profit of $1.75 billion in the first quarter. </p><p>   Snap and Intel were among the companies to report earning results after markets closed. </p><p>   Snap reported a jump in sales and a narrower quarterly loss as the social-media platform gained more users, helping shares jump nearly 5% after hours. </p><p>   Conversely, Intel reported lower quarterly sales and revenue. The tech company's stock fell 2% in after-hours trading despite raising its outlook for the year. </p><p>   Some investors are wary of the results to come later this year. \"We're just going to have to see [what happens] when you take away the stimulus and the cash payments,\" said Kimberly Woody, a senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. \"We're kind of on a sugar high.\" </p><p>   On the economic front, worker filings for jobless claims reached another Covid-19 low of 547,000 last week. The decline is a sign the labor market is strengthening. </p><p>   Jason Borbora-Sheen, multiasset portfolio manager at Ninety One, expects the broad stock market to trend sideways or decline over the next few months. \"Things have become quite overbought,\" he said. </p><p>   One of the two funds Mr. Borbora-Sheen manages has bought put options to protect against downward moves in stocks. Puts are contracts that pay out if the underlying asset falls below a certain price. </p><p>   Overseas, shares of tech and utility companies led the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.7%. </p><p>   Shares of Credit Suisse Group fell 2.1% after the Swiss lender said it would issue new shares after losses from Archegos Capital Management wiped out a strong first quarter. </p><p>   Renault shares dropped 1.3% after the French car maker said revenue fell in the first quarter. </p><p>   The European Central Bank left its key interest rates and bond-buying programs unchanged, seeking to maintain support for governments and companies through a new round of coronavirus infections and restrictions. </p><p>   In Asia, chemical and pharmaceutical stocks helped Japan's Nikkei 225 climb 2.4%. At midday Friday, the Nikkei lost 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1%. S&amp;P futures were up 0.2%. </p><p></p>",
