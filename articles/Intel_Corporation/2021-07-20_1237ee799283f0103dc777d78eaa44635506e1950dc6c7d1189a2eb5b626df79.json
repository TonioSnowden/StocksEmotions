  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: former <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> chief <strong>Leon Black</strong> has forcefully rejected claims that he raped and harassed a young Russian model, branding the woman's lawsuit “a work of fiction”, and contending that text messages and audio recordings show that he has “become the victim of a criminal extortion scheme”. Read the full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1a0cef-f25c-42bd-ae12-ac4dfb6971d7\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Apparently, Bill Ackman can't do whatever he wants</h2> <p><strong>Bill Ackman</strong> had big plans for his blank-cheque company.&#xa0;</p> <p>As DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c356c4-c60f-4dcb-b642-9386003c1615\">explained</a> last month, they involved an extremely complex and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d77d9883-6b01-4458-9180-8579aa4d346f\">unique deal</a> in which his Spac<strong> Pershing Square Tontine Holdings</strong> would pay $4bn for a 10 per cent stake in <strong>Universal Music</strong>, home to artists including <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> and <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> had other ideas.&#xa0;</p> <p>The regulator has raised concerns about the deal, including how it was structured, forcing Ackman's special purpose acquisition company to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e819d8c9-2f0f-43f5-a652-1dd216da31f1\">abandon</a> its investment in the music group owned by <strong>Vivendi</strong>, the French media conglomerate controlled by billionaire <strong>Vincent Bolloré</strong>.</p> <p>The complicated transaction, announced in June, also came with two further opportunities for PSTH shareholders to participate in Ackman-led deals.&#xa0;</p> <p>One was through the existing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d77d9883-6b01-4458-9180-8579aa4d346f\">Spac structure</a>, to which $1.6bn of cash would be added from Ackman's hedge fund <strong>Pershing Square</strong>, and the other through a Sparc — a special purpose acquisition rights company — that doesn't require investors to put up cash beforehand. It was hailed as the Spac 2.0.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now Ackman is back to square one after the SEC ultimately decided that the transaction wouldn't meet <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong> rules for a Spac.</p> <p>For anyone that has been following the SEC's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">crackdown</a> on the Spac market, it probably doesn't come as much of a surprise.&#xa0;</p> <p>The arrival of <strong>Gary Gensler</strong>, President Joe Biden's pick to lead the regulator, has led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/491606db-9307-40b6-8f2a-62c352d954fd\">greater scrutiny</a> of Spac transactions as seen recently with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/589dad7d-9bd7-454b-84d5-ff97cd3c2422\"><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/491606db-9307-40b6-8f2a-62c352d954fd\"><strong>Momentus</strong></a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, Ackman's frustration with the SEC is clear to see. In an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/bill-ackman-still-sees-a-massive-economic-boom-despite-the-delta-variant-says-rates-to-rebound.html\">interview</a> with CNBC television on Monday morning, he said the regulator had put a “dagger in the heart of the transaction” and unhappy investors should complain to the commission.&#xa0;</p> <p>All isn't lost, however. Ackman's hedge fund will now acquire a $2bn stake in Universal with the option to buy the other half by September. If Ackaman's as convinced of the company's huge upside as he says he is, Pershing will now have greater exposure to Universal than it ever would have through the Spac transaction.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ackman has 18 months to find a new target for the Spac. That means more waiting for his legions of<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1400691878283071493\"> “Tontards”</a>. The odds of that happening now are slimmer, too.&#xa0;</p> <p>Aside from having less time, shell companies have again fallen out of favour with businesses and he's back to looking for an elephant transaction with $4bn in the pot.&#xa0;</p> <p>If he doesn't get one, shareholders get their money back plus interest, and the worst thing that will have happened is Ackman having his ego bruised. For now, Ackman needs take to Swift's advice and just “shake it off”.</p> <h2>The Italian luxury dynasty suiting up for a Spac debut</h2> <p>The last time the Financial Times sat down with <strong>Gildo Zegna</strong>, head of the Italian luxury group <strong>Ermenegildo Zegna</strong>, he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de5969a4-1a72-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af\">told us</a> he had no intentions of taking the business his grandfather founded in 1910 public.&#xa0;</p> <p>One pandemic and more than a year and a half later, the 65-year-old chief executive has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c729cad3-b28a-41eb-890c-0b3a9112c4af\">reversed course</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ermenegildo Zegna has agreed to go public by combining with a US Spac launched by the European private equity group<strong> Investindustrial</strong> and chaired by former <strong>UBS</strong> chief<strong> Sergio Ermotti</strong>. The deal values Ermenegildo Zegna at a rich enterprise value of $3.2bn.</p> <p>It will allow the family to take some $546m of the funds raised from the Spac deal, net of fees, off the table. The family will retain 62 per cent of the combined company.&#xa0;</p> <p>A further $250m raised will be used to invest in Ermenegildo Zegna's menswear business, building on its<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a962ae6-aabf-11e8-89a1-e5de165fa619\"> $500m purchase</a> of the US luxury suit maker <strong>Thom Browne</strong> in 2018.</p> <p>One explanation for Zegna's change of heart can be interpreted from its financial performance, which begins on page 54 of its <a href=\"https://www.zegnagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ERMENEGILDO-ZEGNA-GROUP-INVESTOR-PRESENTATION.pdf\">investor presentation</a>, and shows a business hurt badly by the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Revenues dropped 23 per cent to €1bn in 2020 from the year before, while the company swung to a net loss of €45m from a profit of €38m.</p> <p>“We could have remained independent for another 100 years. But the moment is appropriate and the world has changed a lot, and luxury has become very challenging,” Zegna told DD.</p> <p>Diversifying its wardrobe is critical, as Ermenegildo Zegna <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc090e84-c9ff-11e7-ab18-7a9fb7d6163e\">strives to tailor</a> its menswear collections to an ever-evolving concept of modern masculinity. Posing a further challenge, as the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f8c2e9-671a-4db7-8b68-779357126448?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">notes</a>, is the fact that formal attire is falling out of fashion.&#xa0;</p> <p>The tie-up also connects two influential Italian families: Investindustrial is founded and run by the private equity tycoon <strong>Andrea Bonomi</strong>, a descendant of one of the country's prominent industrial families. He used funds from his own family and the billionaire <strong>Benetton</strong> clan to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5edfd9e0-556a-11e1-9d95-00144feabdc0\">launch</a> his Luxembourg-based buyout group.</p> <p>As for its future leadership, Bonomi maintains that keeping a Zegna at the helm would be the “right thing” as the business enters the public sphere, but that it comes down to merit in the end.</p> <p>Rather than succession, the Zegna clan has more pressing concerns: shares in the Investindustrial Spac dropped 3.3 per cent to below $10 on news of the deal.</p> <h2>What we learnt from US bank earnings</h2> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7227667-6c48-4019-af3f-02ebdc1161cb\">we told you</a> how two of Wall Street's biggest players, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, scored big on revenue from dealmaking as a slowdown in trading meant less money to be made from their more traditional revenue streams.</p> <p>Now Morgan Stanley has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/816b165a-b891-4638-8ae6-fa272d0fca4c\">entered the mix</a>, becoming the latest US lender to use bumper investment banking fees to pick up some of the slack amid declining revenues from stocks and bonds trading.</p> <p>The bank gleaned $2.4bn of investment banking revenues in the second quarter, 15.8 per cent higher than a year ago and above analyst expectations of $2.06bn. Meanwhile, quarterly trading revenues fell by 20 per cent from the previous year, as a 45 per cent slide in trading bonds and other fixed-income instruments offset a modest 8 per cent uptick in equities revenues.</p> <p>Although its investment banking gains failed to outperform JPM and Goldman, Morgan Stanley posted a strong performance from its wealth management unit, which could prove useful as Wall Street embarks on a gold rush in China to strike it big on the country's ballooning household <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfa56fcc-e345-4c17-b988-b1194b3d9ab5\">wealth</a>.</p> <p>This earnings season also taught us <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37945600-b2ca-4739-8c79-d3f6cbb83ceb\">another thing</a>: the threat from new <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-stimulus-fintech-analysis/analysis-digital-banks-gain-u-s-customers-during-pandemic-thanks-to-early-deposits-idUSKBN29I1H6\">fintech rivals</a> has never been more pervasive, as banks increase their spending on pay and technology to retain their ranks and ward off outside competitors.</p> <p>Costs at the top US banks jumped more than $6.6bn in the most recent quarter, with JPM, Goldman, Morgan Stanley,<strong> Bank of America</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong> all reporting expense increases between 7 to 14 per cent.</p> <p>Not to mention the latest trend in private equity, where buyout firms are circumventing big banks and finding new sources of financing, including direct lenders and their very own credit departments.
