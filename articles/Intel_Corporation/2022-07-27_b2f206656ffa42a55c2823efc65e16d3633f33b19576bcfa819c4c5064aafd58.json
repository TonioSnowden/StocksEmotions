  "text": "<p>Peron, in an interview, said one reason for this year's decline for semiconductor stocks was that they had had a good, long run, stretching valuations. \"Semiconductors are cyclical,\" he said. In his role, Peron and his team provide advice to many portfolio managers, including those of the Janus Henderson Technology and Innovation Fund JATIX.</p><p>One of the biggest players, Intel Corp. INTC, will publish second-quarter results on July 28 after the market close. Here's a preview.</p><p>This space is very much in play, with the Senate just passing a bill that includes $52.7 billion in subsidy for the semiconductor industry. The bill passes to the House of Representatives which may follow suit this week. President Joe Biden has expressed support for the bill.</p><p>Cheaper than the S&amp;P 500</p><p>The stock-market benchmark for this corner of the technology sector is the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, which is made up of 30 stocks of U.S.-listed makers of computer chips and related manufacturing equipment and is tracked by the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX.

Let's dig further into the semiconductor space.</p><p>Screening semiconductor stocks</p><p>For a broad screen of semiconductor stocks, we began with the SOXX 30 but then added companies in the S&amp;P Composite 1500 Index XX:SP1500 (made up of the S&amp;P 500 SPX, the S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap Index MID and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index SML) in the \"Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment\" Global Industrial Classification Standard (GICS) industry group.</p><p>We looked within the S&amp;P Composite 1500 because it screens-out newer companies that haven't achieved consistent profitability. Standard &amp; Poor's criteria for initial inclusion in the index includes positive earnings for the most recent quarter and for the sum of the most recent four quarters.</p><p>Our initial group included 56 companies, which we narrowed to the 37 for which consensus sales estimates were available through 2024 among at least five analysts polled by FactSet. We used calendar-year estimates — some of the companies have fiscal years that don't match the calendar.</p><p>Here are the 15 companies are expected to achieve the highest sales CAGR from 2022 through 2024: </p><p> Company                                           Ticker   Projected sales CAGR   Forward P/E   Forward P/E as of Dec. 31, 2021   Market cap ($mil)  Wolfspeed Inc                                     WOLF     36.8%                  347.7         N/A                               $9,414  First Solar Inc.
