  "title": "Nvidia Warns of Sales Shortfall as Gaming Revenue Drops; Sales warning is latest sign of slackening demand for computer chips",
  "text": "<p>It was also below Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting total revenue of $8.12 billion and gaming revenue of $3.09 billion.</p><p>Chief Executive Jensen Huang said gaming revenue declined significantly as the quarter progressed and the company is adjusting prices and inventory levels in response.</p><p>\"As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory,\" he said.</p><p>Nvidia shares fell 8% in morning trading on Monday. The stock has retreated more than 38% this year.</p><p>The warning came after Advanced Micro Devices Inc. CEO Lisa Su last week said graphics chips prized by PC gamers fell in the second quarter, reflecting pressure on consumer spending from the current economic slowdown. Nvidia graphics cards are also used in cryptocurrency mining. Those activities have slowed down sharply amid a drop in digital currencies.</p><p>Chip companies broadly have been facing softening demand in consumer-facing electronics after the pandemic fueled the sales of devices such as laptops. Smartphone sales also have eased in recent months.</p><p>Intel Corp. late last month spooked investors when it reported a surprise quarterly loss, a 22% drop in quarterly sales and cut its full-year sales outlook as PC sales fell. Mobile-phone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc., in its quarterly earnings last month, said it expects 650 million to 700 million 5G smartphones to be shipped this year, down from an earlier forecast of more than 750 million units.</p><p>Nvidia has prospered in recent years from the rapid growth in artificial intelligence calculations where its graphics processors excel. The company's sales rose strongly through the pandemic; it last reported a quarterly sales decline in 2019.</p><p>Nvidia has been dialing back hiring as it braces for a slowdown in both crypto mining and videogames.</p><p>On Monday, it said it is slowing growth of operating expenses and managing profits for the near term. It said it would continue plans for stock buybacks.</p><p>Revenue from Nvidia's data-center business, projected to be up 61% from a year ago, fell short of internal expectations due to supply-chain problems.</p><p>Nvidia also said it would post more than $1.3 billion charges for inventory and related reserves based on reduced expectations of future demand. Those reflect long-term purchase commitments it made during a time of severe component shortages and its current expectation of continuing macroeconomic uncertainty.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com and Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Nvidia Warns of Sales Shortfall as Gaming Revenue Drops</p>",
