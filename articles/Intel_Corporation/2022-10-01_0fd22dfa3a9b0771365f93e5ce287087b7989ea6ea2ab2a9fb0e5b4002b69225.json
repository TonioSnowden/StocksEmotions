  "text": "<p><strong>London</strong> On Tuesday this week, Dame Shirley Bassey — the only singer to record three James Bond theme songs — will take to the stage of the Royal Albert Hall for a special concert marking the 60th anniversary of 007's first film appearance. </p> <p><em>Dr No</em> premiered on October 5 1962, and although reviews were mixed (“somehow the poor chap almost always manages to seem slightly silly” wrote Time), the film spawned one of cinema's most enduring and profitable series. Other events to mark the anniversary include a weekend of screenings at the British Film Institute, an auction of memorabilia at Christie's and the launch of a range of special whiskies from Macallan. </p> <p>Since its inception, the franchise has involved numerous commercial tie-ups, from car, drinks and watchmakers to perfumers, toy manufacturers and even a sock retailer using the line “for your feet only”. However the anniversary brings one genuine first: Eon, the production company behind the movies, has partnered with the London and New York-based travel company Black Tomato to launch a collection of “immersive” Bond-inspired trips. While many other companies have sold holidays on the back of 007 movies, these will be the first itineraries created with Eon's input and the help of location scouts who worked on the productions.</p> <p>“It's more than just replicating scenes from Bond; instead, it's about crafting an immersive experience and a narrative that takes travellers into the heart of the James Bond world and celebrates the amazing locations filmed in the last 60 years,” says Ali James, Eon's spokesperson for the project and a location manager on the “Day of the Dead” opening sequence of <em>Spectre</em>.</p> <p>Full details of the trips will be announced next year, but the first will be a journey across Europe, starting in London and lasting about 12 days. Experiences along the way include visiting the Château de Chantilly, featured prominently in <em>A View to a Kill </em>(1985) as the lavish estate of villain Max Zorin, where guests will get a behind the scenes tour of the racehorse training centre before riding through the Chantilly Forest. </p> <p>In Italy, guests will water ski along the Lake Como shoreline — taking inspiration from James Bond in <em>Licence to Kill </em>(1989) — before jumping aboard a private seaplane to fly over Bellagio, Varenna, and Villa La Gaeta, the lakeside home of Spectre agent Mr White in <em>Casino Royale</em> (2006). Only 60 of the packages will be available for each itinerary; prices have yet to be set. <a href=\"http://www.blacktomato.com/james-bond\"><em>blacktomato.com/james-bond</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Tom Robbins 2022 'Shortcuts: on holiday with James Bond' FT.com 1 October.
