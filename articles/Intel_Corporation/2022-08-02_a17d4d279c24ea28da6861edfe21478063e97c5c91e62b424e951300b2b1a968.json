Those chips are used as accelerators in data centers to boost computing power and improve power efficiency in existing physical spaces.</p><p>\"We delivered our eighth straight quarter of record revenue based on our strong execution and expanded product portfolio,\" said Lisa Su, AMD Chief Executive, in a statement. \"Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year, led by higher sales of our data-center and embedded products. We see continued growth in the back half of the year highlighted by our next generation 5nm product shipments and supported by our diversified business model.\"</p><p>Shares fell 4% after hours, following a 2.6% rise to finish the regular session at $99.29.</p><p>Adjusted gross margins came in at 54% for the second quarter, up from the 48% in the year-ago and first quarter.

At that time, Wall Street analysts had a consensus $19.29 billion.</p><p>Last week, Intel Corp. INTC reported dismal results and cu t its outlook for the year, logging a 16% drop in data-center sales to $4.6 billion, and Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger reminding analysts he expects Intel data-center sales to grow slower than the overall market.</p><p>Read: The pandemic PC boom is over, but its legacy will live on</p><p>Back in June, AMD said at its analyst day it expects average annual revenue growth of about 20% over the next three to four years.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, AMD stock has declined 8%. Over the same period, the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX has fallen 11%, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has declined 6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has dropped 15%.</p><p>Elsewhere in the chip sector, Texas Instruments Inc.'s TXN results and outlook topped Wall Street estimates at the time, while Qualcomm Inc.'s QCOM outlook fell short because of weakening handset sales.</p><p>Chip industry supplier Lam Research Corp. LRCX topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter and forecast an outlook that was mostly above consensus, while rival KLA Corp. KLAC issued an outlook range that was partly below Wall Street estimates at the time.
