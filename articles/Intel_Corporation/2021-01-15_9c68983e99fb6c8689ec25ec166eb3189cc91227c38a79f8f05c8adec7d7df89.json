  "text": "<p>There is no quick fix to the situation, either. Adding new chip-making machinery can be expensive and slow, and some of the deepest supply problems are taking place with older production lines that are less lucrative for manufacturers.</p><p>\"In the whole semiconductor industry there is very little [spare] capacity right now -- everything is doing well,\" said Risto Puhakka, president of VLSIresearch, an industry-analysis firm.</p><p>Suppliers as diverse as graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp., America's largest semiconductor company by value, and NXP Semiconductors NV, a Dutch supplier of automotive, industrial and communications chips, are being affected by supply crunches.</p><p>Demand for laptops has skyrocketed, and remote work during the Covid-19 era has increased appetite for cloud-computing services and the data centers behind them. On top of that, a surge in demand for chips that go into new 5G phones has put a squeeze on manufacturing capacity, chip companies say. And U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. led competitors to try to steal market share.</p><p>Ford Motor Co. said it was going to idle a factory in Kentucky this week because of chip shortages that have also led some competitors to change production plans. In the face of the shortages, General Motors Co. last month asked suppliers to stockpile a year's worth of chips.</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, said Thursday it was working with the car industry to address critical shortages. Chief Executive C.C. Wei also said TSMC's customers are likely to boost chip inventory to protect against future bottlenecks. The manufacturer said it was boosting capital investments by at least 47% this year from 2020 amid surging demand.</p><p>It has been a newsy period for chip makers. Intel Corp. this week ousted its chief executive, Bob Swan, after product delays, and mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm Inc. added to a deal-making frenzy.</p><p>Chip customers usually place bulk orders well ahead of time, but fulfillment has been taking much longer than usual. Lead times across the industry have risen to six months, from eight to 10 weeks before the pandemic, said Elsie Neoh, a commodity manager at electronic-components distributor Fusion Worldwide.</p><p>The surge in demand is expected to boost sales for contract chip makers that account for a major share of the world's semiconductors. Sales are expected to grow 6% this year, reaching a record high, according to Taipei-based analysis firm TrendForce. TSMC is running at about 90% of capacity for its most advanced chips, TrendForce said last month.</p><p>Globalfoundries Inc., a major U.S.-based contract chip maker, is doubling its capital investment this year compared with 2020 to boost capacity, said Mike Hogan, the company's senior vice president overseeing automotive and industrial chip making.</p><p>Where the broader chip-industry shortages are being felt most acutely, in many cases, isn't at the cutting edge of technology, but rather those products using older and cheaper processes that aren't as lucrative for manufacturers, analysts and industry executives say.</p><p>Chip makers have invested in production lines that churn out more modern, higher-margin chips, but they haven't kept pace with capacity increases to satisfy still-growing demand for products built on an older standard of silicon wafers, they said.</p><p>The chip industry is warning that the situation won't be resolved for some time. Bruce Kim, chief executive of SurplusGlobal, a South Korean broker of used semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, said most contract chip makers using older-generation silicon wafers were fully booked until the end of this year. The chip shortage, he said, would likely last through the end of 2022.</p><p>The impact on the car industry, which was hit by a supply slump and plants idled by Covid-19 early in the pandemic, has been particularly pronounced.</p><p>NXP, a chip supplier to the automotive industry, told customers in November it saw a \"severe shortage\" of chips and said it would raise prices on all its products. Microchip Technology Inc. Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said Tuesday at an auto forum that the company's bookings and backlog were at all-time highs, but that it was facing capacity constraints that would continue well into this year.</p><p>Lead times on some products were 40 weeks or more, he said, adding that Microchip had been driven to raise prices.</p><p>---</p><p>Chieko Tsuneoka, Raffaele Huang, Ben Foldy and Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.</p>",
