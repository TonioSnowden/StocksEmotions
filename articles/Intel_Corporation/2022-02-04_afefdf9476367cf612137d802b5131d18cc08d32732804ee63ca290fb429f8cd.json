  "text": "<p>US President Joe Biden seized on an unexpected surge in employment last month to tout the resilience of the US recovery and reboot flagging public confidence in his handling of the economy. </p> <p>“America's job machine is going stronger than ever,” Biden said from the White House on Friday after data showed the US economy added 467,000 jobs last month despite the surge of Omicron. “[It's] fuelling a strong recovery and opportunity for hardworking women and men all across this great country. America is back to work.” </p> <p>The surprise increase in payrolls defied predictions by economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who had projected job gains of 150,000. </p> <p>In addition to the jump in payrolls in January, there were large upward revisions to data from previous months, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics undercounting the number of jobs created by roughly 700,000 in November and December. </p> <p>The monthly revisions of 398,000 for November and 311,000 for December were each greater than the largest single upward revision posted in April 1981, on a seasonally adjusted basis. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1125070.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The strong data, which also showed wage growth rising more than predicted, will come as a relief for a White House that had warned jobs growth might be temporarily hit by the jump in Covid-19 infections. It will fuel expectations that the Federal Reserve will move more aggressively than planned to tighten monetary policy to stamp out inflation.</p> <p>The unemployment rate climbed to 4 per cent despite the strong gains, from 3.9 per cent previously. </p> <p>US government bonds sold off sharply after Friday's jobs report, pushing Treasury yields to their highest level since the start of the pandemic. The decline in the price of the debt, which moves inversely to yields, also increases pressure on the central bank to fight inflation.</p> <p>The biggest rises occurred in shorter-dated maturities, suggesting investors were betting that this would give the Fed more ammunition to raise interest rates. The 30-year real rate rose above zero for the first time since June 2020. </p> <p>The BLS data on Friday was collected during the worst of the Omicron surge in the US, which fuelled a record-setting number of Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and fatalities.</p> <p>The White House has touted the robust labour market recovery as one of Biden's most important accomplishments in his first year in office, which has otherwise been beset by legislative setbacks. </p> <p>Despite signing into law a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a large fiscal stimulus bill, his landmark $1.75tn Build Back Better spending package has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aad74276-bafd-4090-ab2a-6000ed4a1187\">stalled in Congress</a>. </p> <p>But Biden on Friday touted recent announcements by Intel and General Motors to open manufacturing plants in industrial states such as Ohio and Michigan as evidence that his plans were working. “These announcements are the drumbeat of a job resurgence, unlike anything we've seen in our history — and it didn't happen by chance,” he said. </p> <p>Before the winter wave of coronavirus infections, employers were struggling to fill their ranks, as concerns about catching the virus and childcare issues deterred many people from participating in the workforce. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4450c59-f2a6-49ff-acb5-257a55f141cd\">number of job openings</a> has swelled as a result, with more than 10mn reported in the final month of 2021. That translates to 1.7 job openings for every unemployed worker, the highest since the US government began collecting data two decades ago.</p> <p>Some workers have sought to capitalise on the demand for new hires and have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/857bdeba-b61b-4012-ab82-3c9eb19506df\">left their jobs</a> in search of higher-paying roles. A total of 4.3mn Americans quit in December, just shy of November's 4.5mn record. </p> <p>US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ca4b68d-9df4-45a3-ae7b-09bfd9cc58b7\">labour costs</a> have, in turn, surged, as employers raised wages and sweetened benefits to compete for talent. Hourly earnings rose 5.7 per cent last month compared with a year earlier, and 0.7 per cent compared with December, a larger jump than expected. </p> <p>The Fed is charting a course towards its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c556a131-951d-4283-9e10-36becf77579f\">first interest rate increase</a> since 2018 at its next policy meeting in March.</p> <p>Elevated inflation has compelled the central bank to scale back its monetary policy support far more quickly than planned. Top officials have also left the door open to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f6fae25-de70-4977-aeb7-271fa3af5bc3\">more aggressive string</a> of interest rate rises this year or even raising rates by half a percentage point, as opposed to the quarter-point increases that had become the norm.</p> <p>After Friday's data, the number of interest rate increases priced in by the futures market rose to more than five by the end of 2022.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Adam Samson </em></p><p>Source: James Politi in Washington and Colby Smith and Kate Duguid in New York  2022 'Joe Biden declares jobs recovery ‘stronger than ever' after robust report' FT.com 4 February.
