  "text": "<p>The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that McAfee was nearing a deal to sell itself to a group including Advent and Permira for more than $10 billion or around $25 a share, citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p>McAfee said Monday the purchase price represents a premium of about 22.6% over its closing share price of $21.21 on Thursday. Shares closed Friday up 20% to $25.46. Including debt, the deal is valued at $14 billion.</p><p>Based in San Jose, Calif., McAfee makes software that protects users against computer viruses, malware and other online threats. The company's products are used in 182 countries across more than 600 million devices, according to its website.</p><p>McAfee returned to public markets in October 2020. It is part-owned by private-equity firms TPG and Thoma Bravo LP and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC.</p><p>Intel Corp. bought McAfee in 2011 as part of a strategy to move the chipmaker's technology beyond computers. Intel sold a majority stake in 2017 to TPG, with Thoma Bravo investing then too. Intel still owns a small stake.</p><p>Upon completion of the deal, McAfee said it would be a privately held company and would continue as a pure-play consumer cybersecurity company following the sale of McAfee's Enterprise business to private-equity firm Symphony Technology Group for $4 billion, which closed on July 27.</p><p>McAfee said it expects the deal to close in the first half of 2022. Intel and funds affiliated with TPG agreed to vote their shares in favor of the deal.</p><p>McAfee to Sell Itself to a Private-Equity-Led Group</p>",
