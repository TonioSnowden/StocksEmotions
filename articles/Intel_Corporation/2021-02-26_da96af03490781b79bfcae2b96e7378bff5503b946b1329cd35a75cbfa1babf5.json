  "title": "AT&T to Split Off Its Pay-TV Business",
  "text": "<p>The deal values the new company at $16.25 billion with about $6.4 billion of debt. That is well below the $49 billion -- about $66 billion including debt -- that the Dallas company paid to buy international satellite operator DirecTV in 2015. AT&amp;T recently struck $15.5 billion off the value of the unit, reflecting the service's dimmer prospects.</p><p>AT&amp;T said it would get about $7.8 billion in cash from the transaction to help pay down debts. Those proceeds include $5.8 billion that the new company will borrow from banks and pay back to AT&amp;T.</p><p>AT&amp;T will be able to stop including results from its U.S. video operations in its consolidated financial reports. The telecom company also agreed to cover up to $2.5 billion in losses tied to DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package.</p><p>Bidders including TPG and its rival Apollo Global Management Inc. had been jockeying for the business since The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the sale process in August.</p><p>AT&amp;T shares fell 75 cents, or 2.6%, to $28.63 on Thursday.</p><p>AT&amp;T bought DirecTV near the peak of the pay-TV market, before cord-cutting upended the sector. Netflix Inc. had about 75 million subscribers world-wide, far below the more than 200 million subscribers it serves today. Cheap channel bundles costing $30 a month or less hadn't yet pierced the market.</p><p>TPG has experience with pay-TV investments. In November it said it would sell Astound Broadband, the operator of cable brands including RCN, for $8.1 billion, including debt. Its media and entertainment investments include Spotify Technology SA, talent agency CAA and payroll-services company Entertainment Partners.</p><p>The buyout firm also has a history of carving assets out of big corporations and joining with their owners to improve them. In 2016, TPG bought a 51% stake in cybersecurity-software provider McAfee LLC from Intel Corp., and in 2018 it took a stake in Allogene Therapeutics Inc., then a unit of drugmaker Pfizer Inc.</p><p>TPG's investment in DirecTV will come in the form of senior preferred equity with a 10% cash coupon.</p><p>AT&amp;T bought DirecTV more than five years ago and merged the business with its smaller cable-like TV service, turning the cellphone carrier into the country's biggest pay-TV purveyor overnight. It also saddled the company with a mountain of debt that grew larger after its purchase of entertainment producer Time Warner Inc. in 2018.</p><p>The two megadeals allowed AT&amp;T to rival cable giant Comcast Corp. and its NBCUniversal division. But the business came together near the cusp of a \"cord-cutting\" trend that prompted millions of people in the U.S. to cancel their satellite and cable-TV service.</p><p>AT&amp;T lost seven million domestic pay-TV subscribers over the past two years. Comcast lost about two million such customers over the same period. Dish Network Corp., DirecTV's satellite-TV rival, shed roughly one million subscribers.</p><p>The melting satellite business and the debt amassed to acquire it has weighed on AT&amp;T's stock in recent years. Activist hedge fund Elliott Management challenged the company to cast off unneeded business units and buy back stock, among other recommendations. The company launched a formal sale process for the video unit after longtime AT&amp;T executive John Stankey became chief executive in June.</p><p>Transferring some of the pay-TV unit's debt helps AT&amp;T whittle down its obligations, which could increase in the coming months after the carrier agreed to spend $23.4 billion on wireless spectrum licenses. A net debt load listed above $180 billion after the Time Warner transaction recently stood around $148 billion.</p><p>Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday told clients that the spectrum splurge could pressure AT&amp;T's credit rating, which sits two steps above junk territory. In a brief note Thursday, Moody's called the DirecTV deal \"moderately credit positive\" because it would produce cash to help cover the spectrum costs.</p><p>AT&amp;T's entertainment strategy now rests on the success of HBO Max, a streaming service built atop the premium cable channel's brand. The service launched in May 2020, entering a crowded field of similar services from Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co., among others.</p><p>HBO Max initially struggled to draw its existing customer base away from subscriptions provided through partnerships with cable-TV providers and device makers. Growth improved near the end of 2020 after executives forged deals with companies like Amazon and Roku Inc.</p><p>The service also gained a flood of sign-ups by showing new film releases from its sister studio Warner Bros. online the same day they arrived in theaters.</p><p>Mr. Stankey said the move, which upended a Hollywood model in place for decades, was a temporary answer to the box-office disruption the coronavirus pandemic caused. HBO Max counted 17 million activated accounts at the end of December.</p>",
