  "title": "Qualcomm Buys Chip Startup for $1.4 Billion",
  "text": "<p>Nuvia's expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency -- characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority.</p><p>The San Diego chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia's staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit before Nuvia.</p><p>\"The Nuvia team are proven innovators,\" said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm's president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopf as chief executive at midyear.</p><p>A wave of deal making across the U.S. semiconductor landscape is transforming the industry amid strong demand for laptops, videogames and data centers. That demand has sent shares in some companies surging, helping them gain financial muscle to do deals.</p><p>Nvidia Corp., whose shares more than doubled last year, has overtaken Intel Corp. as America's highest-valued chip company. The graphics-chip maker agreed last year to pay $40 billion for Arm Holdings, the British designer of mobile-phone chips backed by SoftBank Group Corp., in what would be the industry's biggest deal if it goes through.</p><p>Nuvia's CPUs -- and Qualcomm's chips, which power hundreds of millions of mobile phones -- are based on Arm technology.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has said it plans to buy rival chip maker Xilinx Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $35 billion. Those proposed tie-ups landed after Analog Devices Inc. in July agreed to pay more than $20 billion for Maxim Integrated Products Inc.</p><p>Qualcomm's stock has risen about 70% over the past year, fueled in part by growing demand for superfast 5G phones.</p><p>The deal, which requires federal regulatory approval in the U.S., is a pivot for Nuvia, which began in 2019 as a stealth startup working on CPUs for computer servers that it expected would challenge market leaders Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. The company raised $240 million in its second funding round in September and was expecting to start testing its first silicon chips this year.</p>",
