  "text": "<p>The massive social network dropped its Reddit Recap 2021 this week, which rounds up the most popular posts, topics and conversations on its platform over the past year. And cryptocurrency was hands down the most popular topic on Reddit in 2021, with people mentioning “crypto” 6.6 million times. There are also more than 500 cryptocurrency communities on Reddit, and the five most popular ones this year were&#xa0;r/dogecoin,&#xa0;r/superstonk,&#xa0;r/cryptocurrency,&#xa0;r/amcstock, and&#xa0;r/bitcoin.</p><p>The Most Viewed Topics of 2021 on Reddit</p><p>Cryptocurrency</p><p>Gaming</p><p>Sports</p><p>Weddings</p><p>Health and Fitness</p><p>Food and Drink</p><p>Movies and Television</p><p>Cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin DOGEUSD, Ethereum ETHUSD and Shiba Inu also topped Google's 2021 Year in Search, which the Alphabet-owned GOOGL search engine released this week. “Dogecoin” and “Ethereum price” landed in the top 10 most-Googled news stories of the past year, both in the U.S. and across the globe. And the top two “Where to buy” Google searches were “Where to buy Dogecoin?” and&#xa0;“Where to buy Shiba coin?”</p><p>Read more:Google's 2021 Year in Search: AMC and GME stocks, Dogecoin, stimulus checks and shortages dominated queries</p><p>Whats's more, a recent Rover.com survey found that&#xa0;pet owners are actually naming their dogs “Doge” and their cats “Bitcoin.”</p><p>And a group of crypto investors named ConstitionDAO tried making history last month by crowdfunding more than $40 million to bid on a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution. Alas, it lost out to Citadel founder Ken Griffin, who spent $43.2 million on the historic document.&#xa0;</p><p>Reddit notes that the rise of these retail and crypto investors looking to game the system has had real-world impact, such as the GameStop GME short squeeze in January. Maybe. The year-end Reddit report credits redditors with being “catalysts for real-world change” over the past year.</p><p>Want intel on all the news moving markets each day?&#xa0;Sign up for our daily Need to Know newsletter.&#xa0;</p><p>“From&#xa0;r/wallstreetbets&#xa0;and the&#xa0;crash of the One Simple Wish website, to the&#xa0;Battle of the Joshes, in 2021, the most notable moments on Reddit were when redditors took their comments, comradery, conversations, and more from URL to IRL,” Reddit staff wrote in a blog post.&#xa0;</p><p>Reddit's year-end review notes that users created 366 million posts over the past year, which was a 19% increase year over year. And as of Nov. 9, 2021, Reddit drew more than 2.3 billion total comments and 46 billion upvotes; aka when users show their approval for a post by clicking an “up” arrow, which pushes the post toward the top of the site so that more people can see it.</p><p>The three most upvoted Reddit posts of the year came from the retail investors on the WallStreetBets, and the Superstonk page (which describes itself as discussing GameStop stock specifically) saw a 917K% increase in subscribers year over year.&#xa0;</p><p>Those eager to learn more about the sometimes volatile world of meme stocks can check out MarketWatch's&#xa0;MemeMoney column&#xa0;and&#xa0;weekly MemeMarkets videos on YouTube.

The number of “idlers” (aka members) in this community for “those who want to end work, are curious about ending work, want to get the most out of a work-free life, want more information on antiwork ideas and want personal help with their own jobs/work-related struggles” spiked 279% this year.</p><p>This video highlights the “oddities and commodities” discussed on Reddit this year, such as meme stocks like AMC AMC and GameStop, supply chain issues, the billionaire space race and the breakout Netflix NFLX hit “Squid Game.”&#xa0;</p><p>Check out the full Reddit recap here.</p>",
