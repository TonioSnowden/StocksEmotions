  "text": "<p>Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger set a goal for the company to reach double-digit revenue growth in three to four years, as he detailed the financial ambitions of his turnaround plan for the semiconductor giant.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger, now just over a year in the CEO role, on Thursday said top-line growth this year would be \"moderate\" and start to pick up next year. Around 2025 or 2026, sales should increase 10% to 12% a year and remain at a double-digit pace going forward.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger has set a multifaceted, multiyear plan to revive Intel's fortunes. The company ceded the title of most valuable U.S. chip company to Nvidia Corp. in 2020 and that of biggest chip company by revenue to Samsung Electronics Co. last year. He's moving to restore the company's ability to design some of the most powerful chips and build a massive semiconductor production arm. Intel has committed to more than $100 billion in chip-plant investments over the past year, including last month's announcement to build a new production site in Ohio.</p><p>And this week the company said it planned to purchase Israeli chip company Tower Semiconductor Ltd. The turnaround effort, Mr. Gelsinger has said, is roughly a five-year assignment.</p><p>\"We are a bit ahead of schedule,\" Mr. Gelsinger said at the investor day, while adding, \"We still have a lot of work to do.\"</p><p>Intel's stock closed down 1.37% at $47.57 Thursday and was little changed in after-hours trading, as the keynote presentation began.</p><p>The Intel boss has been bullish about the semiconductor industry's outlook amid booming demand that has led to shortages of some chips. The chip business is expected to roughly double by the end of the decade into a $1 trillion industry, Mr. Gelsinger and some of his counterparts have said.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger also has detailed plans to take the Mobileye self-driving-car unit public this year. Intel acquired the business in 2017 and expects to retain a stake in the business after its initial public offering.</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Intel CEO Sees Revenue Growth Gaining Pace Starting Next Year</p>",
