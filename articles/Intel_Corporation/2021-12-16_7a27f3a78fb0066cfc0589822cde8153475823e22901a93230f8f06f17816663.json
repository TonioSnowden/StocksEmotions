  "text": "<p>Retailers have urged consumers to get the items on their wish lists early due to supply-chain backlogs and other issues that could keep presents from reaching their destinations in time. Some analysts say shoppers have heeded that warning, driving up October retail sales numbers but pushing down the November tally.</p><p>GlobalData highlights the COVID-related changes to the 2020 holiday season, when fewer people gathered to celebrate and in-store shopping declined.</p><p>“This year, all of that changed and most shoppers reverted to old habits – visiting malls, buying things in preparation for gatherings, and treating themselves to bargains and deals,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData.</p><p>See:U.S. retail sales soften in November as consumers face high inflation</p><p>“The main change was in the timing of purchasing and spending, which was spread more evenly across November as opposed to being concentrated into the last week around Thanksgiving. In our view, it is also likely that a modest amount of December spending has been pulled into November as shoppers started their holiday purchasing earlier.”</p><p>Plante Moran Financial Advisors notes the decline versus retail sales in October, but highlights the 1% increase at bars and restaurants.</p><p>“The data suggests that consumers may have simply pulled much of their holiday shopping forward, getting a jump on the spending season.

However, it also signals that, come 2022, there could be a moderation in growth as bills come in and households look to balance their books.”</p><p>Also: Jack in the Box faced problems with the Qdoba acquisition, but analysts are more upbeat about Del Taco</p><p>The National Retail Federation is forecasting a record holiday shopping season, with sales reaching between $843.4 billion and $859 billion.</p><p>The SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF XRT has gained 40% for the year, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY is up 25%, and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 25.4% for the period.</p>",
