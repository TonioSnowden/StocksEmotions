  "title": "Bureaucrats to the Rescue; How many governments does it take to disrupt U.S. technology?",
  "text": "<p>The question for consumers is whether to trust some of the world's largest bureaucracies to solve this problem. The Journal's Yuka Hayashi reports from Pittsburgh:</p><p>One of the key outcomes of the meeting was to enhance cooperation on semiconductors to advance transparency and communication in their supply chains, the statement said. The two sides will together \"identify gaps, shared vulnerabilities, and opportunities\" to strengthen their respective domestic research, developing and manufacturing of semiconductors, it said...</p><p>Biden administration officials last week invited representatives of auto makers, technology companies and semiconductor producers, and pitched a program for companies to reveal more information about their supply chains to better understand the bottlenecks. Both the U.S. and EU plan to shore up domestic semiconductor production with government assistance.</p><p>This column understands that right now every political problem seems small next to Bernie Sanders' pending multitrillion-dollar assault on American markets. (And yes of course the Sanders plan includes meddling in auto supply chains among myriad other government interventions).</p><p>But inviting foreign bureaucrats as well as our own domestic 'crats to play a larger role in the U.S. chip industry can go wrong in so many ways.</p><p>Among the Europeans participating in the new U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council that met on Wednesday in Pittsburgh is European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis. Bloomberg reports:</p><p>Speaking ahead of the meeting, Dombrovskis said the council, referred to as TTC, was about joining forces with the U.S. on sensitive technologies to make sure that they don't end up in the wrong hands and protecting economies and companies from risky investments, as well as controlling sensitive technologies in the future.</p><p>So the European bureaucrats want to protect our economies from risky investments. Do they mean the kind of risky investments that created the U.S. semiconductor industry, not to mention the software and social media giants of Silicon Valley?</p><p>Europeans have been very well protected from the risk of creating such enterprises, though European bureaucrats specialize in pestering and frustrating the ones created elsewhere.</p><p>This brings us to another European leader participating in the Pittsburgh meeting, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Journal readers know her as perhaps the world'smost aggressive abuserof U.S. tech firms. Any help she will offer to American semiconductor companies is bound to make them smaller and poorer.</p><p>She won't be the only one doing harm, as measures to address temporary chip shortages give way to permanent policies on climate and other fascinations of the progressive left. Already it's clear that this new council will invite the participation of people who have no knowledge of—or stake in—American technological leadership. The group's official Wednesday statement reads in part:</p><p>The European Union and the United States welcome input from and dialogue with business, trade unions, consumer organizations, and environmental and other non-government organizations on the work of the Global Trade Challenges Working Group, including joint input from transatlantic groupings of stakeholders.</p><p>A global movement of \"stakeholders\" with no stake in the U.S. semiconductor industry!</p><p>Even if Ms. Vestager's regulatory dreams are not realized, this effort is bound to cost U.S. taxpayers a lot of money. A real live stakeholder in American technology is Cypress Semiconductor founder T.J. Rodgers, who warned in April:</p><p>President Biden says he is \"studying\" supply chains, but every knowledgeable person in the industry knows that politics and subsidies are irrelevant. The market players will fill this chip shortage before the Democrats and Republicans finish arguing about whose fault it is.</p><p>The U.S. has wasted money \"solving\" the chip problem before. In 1987 the Sematech consortium began spending $500 million in government funds that did zero for the industry. Due to the relentless pace of progress under bare-knuckle competition, Sematech's Austin, Texas, chip plant, was obsolescent when it opened. The layoffs started in 2002.</p><p>Before it all went south for the government-backed enterprise, it went south for chip customers. A Journal editorial in 1992 called Sematech \"a consortium of the industry's fat cats\" that yielded \"a costly price-rigging arrangement with the Japanese chip makers that mainly victimized America's world-beating computer makers and software designers and anyone who paid for their products.\"</p><p>As for today's calls for government intervention in chip production, Mr. Rodgers noted in April:</p><p>Semiconductor industry advocates argue that other countries will take market share if the U.S. government doesn't help. But the governments of Europe and mainland China have been throwing money at chip companies for decades, and neither has a highly competitive chip industry. China's biggest chip company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , or SMIC, is irrelevant compared with Taiwan's free-market foundries. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , TSMC, was founded and run by two veterans of Texas Instruments and competes on a research-and-development budget far smaller than Intel's . Former President Trump also dealt a near-fatal blow last year to SMIC by preventing the export of advanced U.S. semiconductor equipment to China.</p><p>It is true that America has slipped to a 12% market share in semiconductor manufacturing, but it doesn't follow that firms need government help not to slip further. Around 60 years after the commercialization of the integrated circuit, most chips have become commodities with little strategic value, and their manufacturing has been pushed offshore by relentless demand for lower cost.</p><p>These losses aren't dire. Silicon Valley's Intel, Advanced Microdevices and Nvidia make state-of-the-art processors; Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology manufactures advanced memories; and Wilmington, Mass.-based Analog Devices still dominates the market for analog chips. U.S. defense chips aren't dependent on foreign sources, and TSMC, the winner from Asia, is building a plant in Arizona. More important, the industry has moved into the software age, in which the code that drives the chip is usually more important than the chip itself. The U.S. dominates in software, as Google well knows.</p><p>There is no need to give taxpayers' money to some of the smartest and richest corporations in the world. Chip companies thrive in free markets and barely survive in controlled economies.</p><p>***</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Speaking of markets, Jason De Sena Trennert of Strategas Research reminds us that what goes down can also go up again. He writes in a note to clients:</p><p>Today marks the 40th anniversary of the start of the bull market in bonds. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield peaked at 15.84% on September 30, 1981.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>***</p><p>Bureaucrats to the Rescue</p>",
