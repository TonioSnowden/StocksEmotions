  "text": "<p>\"Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you're paying for the product. And do it now,\" he said.</p><p>Responding to the president later in the day on Twitter, Mr. Bezos wrote: \"Ouch. Inflation is far too important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this. It's either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics.\"</p><p>The White House on Sunday rejected Mr. Bezos's criticism.</p><p>\"Oil prices have dropped by about $15 [a barrel] over the past month, but prices at the pump have barely come down. That's not 'basic market dynamics.' It's a market that is failing the American consumer,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote on Twitter.</p><p>\"We obviously take great exception at the idea that this is somehow misdirection,\" John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said on Fox News. \"The president is working very very hard across many fronts to try to bring that price down,\" Mr. Kirby said.</p><p>Gas prices in the U.S. have reached record levels this year, and drivers are feeling the economic burden. The national average price for a gallon of regular gas was $4.81 as of Sunday, according to AAA, about $1.70 higher than it was a year ago.</p><p>Rising gasoline prices have become a significant challenge for the Biden administration. The president proposed last month that Congress suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes for three months, in hopes of alleviating the pain for U.S. drivers. But few lawmakers support the so-called gas tax holiday, which economists said would do little to ease prices anyway.</p><p>The president also has lobbied the Group of Sevencountries to impose a cap on Russian oil exports and has tapped the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p><p>Inflation hit 8.6% in May, marking its fastest pace since December 1981, the Labor Department reported last month.</p><p>Mr. Bezos has previously criticized Mr. Biden's handling of the economy, saying the president was wrong to attempt to tie the corporate tax structure to rising inflation. \"Mushing them together is just misdirection,\" Mr. Bezos tweeted.</p><p>Other business leaders and CEOs have expressed concern over the economy in recent months. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned of an economic \"hurricane\" brewing.</p><p>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk suggested in May that the economy was headed toward recession and announced last month that the electric auto maker planned to cut about 10% of its salaried jobs.</p><p>Asked at the time by reporters about Mr. Musk's dire economic assessment, the president pointed to plans by Ford Motor Co. and Intel Corp. to boost their hiring. \"Lots of luck on his trip to the moon,\" Mr. Biden said.</p><p>Bezos Criticizes Biden's Call for Gas Stations to Cut Prices</p>",
