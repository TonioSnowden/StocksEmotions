  "text": "<p>The sinking of the ship was a major boost for the Ukrainian military in its fight against Russia, whose warships in the Black Sea have been firing cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities.</p><p>The Moskva was about 60 nautical miles south of Odessa when it was hit, and its sinking resulted in a number of other Russian ships moving away from the coastline into the Black Sea, defense officials said.</p><p>U.S. officials later confirmed that the ship had been struck by two Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles. The Russian government has said that the ship had been damaged when ammunition exploded as a result of an accidental fire.</p><p>The 12,000-ton warship was believed to have had a crew of nearly 500 sailors. Independent Russian media have said dozens of sailors died as a result of the sinking. The Kremlin initially claimed the entire crew had been rescued but said late last month that one sailor died and 27 were missing.</p>",
