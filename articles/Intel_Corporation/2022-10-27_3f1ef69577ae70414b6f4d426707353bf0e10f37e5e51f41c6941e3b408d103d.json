  "text": "<p>   Shares of Mobileye Global Inc. rose 38% in their debut, providing a rare bright spot for an IPO market that is having its worst year in memory. </p><p>    Intel Corp.'s automated car-driving unit closed at $28.97, above its initial public offering price of $21 a share, giving Mobileye a valuation of roughly $23 billion. The stock opened on the Nasdaq Stock Market a little before midday Wednesday, trading under the symbol MBLY. </p><p>   The shares were sold late Tuesday at a price above the targeted range of $18 to $20 a share, though that had been lowered before the offering. Advisers to Mobileye were  aware of the perils facing U.S. IPOs given how choppy markets have been this year and priced the offering conservatively, according to people close to the deal. </p><p>   They also adjusted the offering, selling fewer shares than planned -- representing about 5% to 6% of those that will ultimately be outstanding. </p><p>   IPOs in the U.S. had raised $7.4 billion so far this year through Tuesday, putting 2022 on track to be the worst year for new issues in decades, according to Dealogic. </p><p>   Still, Intel and underwriters overseeing the deal were determined to move forward with the IPO, expected to be the last major listing of the year. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said the chip maker doesn't need the money the offering will generate -- more than $800 million -- and that listing Mobileye would give the self-driving-car unit a higher profile and attract more business. </p><p>   Founded in 1999 by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye developed technology that helped alert drivers to potential collisions with other cars or pedestrians. It first entered the stock market in a 2014 IPO that valued it at around $5 billion, making Mobileye the largest Israeli company to go public at the time. Three years later, Intel acquired the money-losing company for $15 billion. When The Wall Street Journal first reported late last year that Intel would spin off Mobileye in an IPO, the self-driving-car unit was expected to fetch a valuation north of $50 billion. </p><p>   \"Being in the public eye creates attention,\" said Mr. Shashua, the company's CEO, adding that because so few shares were sold in the IPO, the valuation at the time of the offering is \"beside the point.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Asa Fitch contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
