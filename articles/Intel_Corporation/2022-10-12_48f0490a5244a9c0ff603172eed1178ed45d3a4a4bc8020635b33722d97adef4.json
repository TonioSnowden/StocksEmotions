PHOTO: Caitlin Ochs for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The U.S. suppliers have paused support of already installed equipment at YMTC in recent days and temporarily halted installation of new tools, the people said. The suppliers are also temporarily pulling out their staff based at YMTC, the people said.</p><p>U.S. chip equipment manufacturers have dozens of employees stationed at YMTC's factory. They play a crucial role in operating the factory and developing its manufacturing capabilities, as they bring in expertise on highly technical chip production tools, people familiar with the situation said. If the halt is extended, customers such as YMTC face being cut off from upgrades, maintenance expertise and future technology they need to develop chips.</p><p>YMTC, KLA and Lam Research didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>While the moves might be temporary, they are immediate signs of business disruptions facing Chinese chip makers and U.S. technology suppliers as Washington escalates its efforts to stifle China's emerging semiconductor industry. The U.S. export control measures, which restrict companies sending chips and chip-making equipment to China, are some of the broadest the U.S. has enacted against China's semiconductor industry. They veer from previous actions that often targeted individual companies and a narrower subset of technology.</p><p>Asa Fitch contributed to this article.</p><p>Chip-Industry Developments, Selected by the Editors</p><p>* SK Hynix Gets One-Year Reprieve From U.S. Chip Restrictions on China</p><p>* Intel CEO Pushes to Further Separate Chip-Design, Production Arms</p><p>Write to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com and Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Suppliers Halt Operations at Top Chinese Memory Chip Maker</p>",
