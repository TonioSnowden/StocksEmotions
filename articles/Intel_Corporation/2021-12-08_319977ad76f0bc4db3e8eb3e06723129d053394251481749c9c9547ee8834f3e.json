Work from anywhere has become the new standard of work.'</p><p>—Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel Corp. on Covid-19 and returning to work</p><p>'I've been perplexed by the reaction to it.

They haven't fully appreciated the fact that China really is going to be the big kid on the block. If you're going to be the big kid on the block, then you really need to be pretty chill about things.'</p><p>-Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, on China's role in manufacturing Tesla vehicles and potential as a global economic force</p><p>'Because of the notion of diversification and the power of what's coming, I think it's important to invest in China.'</p><p>—Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio</p><p>'If Beijing were to decide to try to change the status quo unilaterally by force, it would be a very serious mistake.'</p><p>—Secretary of State Antony Blinken on China's attempts to reshape the global system</p><p>'We are going into a world that is more complex geostrategically.
