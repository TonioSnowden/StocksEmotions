  "title": "World News:  WHO Urges More Virus Research  ---  Team investigating  origins calls for second  phase of investigation  before evidence spoils  ----  By Jeremy Page in Beijing and Drew Hinshaw in Warsaw",
  "text": "<p>   Members of a World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of Covid-19 urged the United Nations agency's member states to mandate a second phase of research, warning that time was running out to examine blood samples and other important clues in China regarding when, how and where the pandemic started. </p><p>   The researchers also called for the U.S. to share with the WHO any intelligence supporting the hypothesis that the Covid-19 virus might have spilled from a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, saying they had already unsuccessfully asked Washington for that information. The first confirmed cases of Covid-19 emerged in Wuhan in December 2019. </p><p>   But in a broadcast Thursday, one of the team members suggested that any audit of Chinese laboratories should be done separately from the second phase of their research. Another expressed doubt that such an audit would reveal anything new. </p><p>   \"I think it's the challenge that proving a negative is just impossible,\" Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the team, said during the This Week in Virology podcast. \"We run the risk indeed of losing the momentum for the real work that needs to be done.\" Dr. Koopmans didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   On Wednesday, President Biden ordered a fresh U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, asking for a report in 90 days that he said should include specific questions for China. U.S. intelligence has focused on two scenarios -- whether the pandemic started as a result of human contact with infected animals, or a laboratory accident -- and the majority view is there is insufficient evidence to prove either one, Mr. Biden said. It was unclear if the podcast was recorded before the president's order. </p><p>   The presidential order came a day after China told a meeting of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, that its portion of the origin-tracing study was finished and the focus should turn to other countries. </p><p>   Beijing has also denied a report in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday about a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that three researchers from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology became sufficiently ill in November 2019 to seek hospital care. </p><p>   U.S. officials have debated the strength of that evidence, which didn't draw any conclusions on what caused the lab workers' sickness. </p><p>   \"The evidence right now, well, for the lab side, it's political: It's from an intel agency that's not been shown. That's not scientific,\" said team member and zoologist Peter Daszak. \"It's not something that you can really reasonably launch a major audit of.\" </p><p>   Dr. Daszak heads the New York-based nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, which has worked for years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, on research into coronaviruses in bats. He has long dismissed the possibility of a lab leak. He didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Dr. Koopmans said in the podcast, \"We have continued to say: Well, if you have evidence then maybe share it confidentially with WHO, and then we can have a look. But without any real evidence that you can look at, then you're stuck, it's a gridlock.\" </p><p>   The WHO-led team visited the WIV during a trip to Wuhan in January and February and concluded in a joint report with Chinese experts in March that a lab leak was \"extremely unlikely.\" But the team was unable to view raw data or original lab, safety and other records, according to team members. </p><p>   On the same day the report was released, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a fuller investigation of the lab-leak hypothesis, saying he was ready to deploy specialist experts. </p><p>   Since then, a growing number of prominent scientists have backed that call. At the World Health Assembly on Tuesday, the European Union called for a deeper probe of all major hypotheses, including a lab accident and another idea, floated by China, that the virus could have been transmitted to humans via frozen food. </p><p>   \"Now everything is stalling, and I think this is really devastating,\" Thea Fischer, a Danish epidemiologist on the team, said on the podcast. </p><p>   In the absence of any new evidence pointing to a lab accident, she said, the investigation should focus on the main hypothesis -- that the virus spilled naturally from animals to humans, outside a laboratory. </p><p>   One key part of the second phase, she said, would be doing antibody tests on samples in blood banks in Wuhan and elsewhere in China. She said a Wuhan blood bank that normally destroyed samples after two years had committed not to do so until the antibody tests were done. </p><p>   \"Elsewhere, it will be destroyed after two years,\" she said. \"So it's really like the clock is ticking.\" </p><p>   She suggested that any laboratory audit should be done separately from the second phase of research. </p><p></p>",
