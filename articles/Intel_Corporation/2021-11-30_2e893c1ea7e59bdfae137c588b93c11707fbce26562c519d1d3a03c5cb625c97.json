  "text": "<p>So far, the emergence of the variant hasn't had an impact on the business, in terms of cancelations or customer-service interactions calls, Mr. Pedan said.</p><p>Since the pandemic started, Kasa has established resiliency measures that should help it respond if demand from tourists and business visitors drops, Mr. Pedan said.</p><p>It has a bigger team focused on monitoring regulatory changes, such as mask and vaccine requirements. The company has ways to adjust its marketing strategy to target a different type of traveler, such as traveling nurses. And Kasa has already adjusted most of its contracts with building owners to be based on revenue-share, so that if it can't fill its rooms it isn't bound to pay a high fixed cost, according to the CEO.</p><p>That being said, \"we'd prefer a world where the world is traveling,\" Mr. Pedan said.</p><p>Even before word of Omicron spread, business travel and international travel were still way down from pre-pandemic levels in the U.S. But Kasa's revenue per room in October, the last full month of data, was 9% higher than it was two years ago, Mr. Pedan said. Near-term and medium-term demand for the typically slow winter travel season was also exceeding expectations, he said.</p><p>\"Folks are pretty tired of battening down the hatches and are seeking reasons to say yes rather than to say no [to travel], even in the context of the new variant,\" Mr. Pedan said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Discovering their inner entrepreneur. The pandemic has unleashed a historic burst in entrepreneurship and self-employment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are striking out on their own as consultants, retailers and small-business owners, Josh Mitchell and Kathryn Dill report for The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The move helps explain the ongoing shake-up in the world of work, with more people looking for flexibility, anxious about Covid exposure, upset about vaccine mandates or simply disenchanted with pre-pandemic office life. It is also aggravating labor shortages in some industries and adding pressure on companies to revamp their employment policies.</p><p>The number of unincorporated self-employed workers has risen by 500,000 since the start of the pandemic, Labor Department data show, to 9.44 million. That is the highest total since the financial-crisis year 2008, except for this summer. The total amounts to an increase of 6% in the self-employed, while the overall U.S. employment total remains nearly 3% lower than before the pandemic.</p><p>$17.6 Billion</p><p>The amount Nissan Motor Co. said it plans to spend over the next five years as it adds 20 new battery-powered vehicles to its lineup.
