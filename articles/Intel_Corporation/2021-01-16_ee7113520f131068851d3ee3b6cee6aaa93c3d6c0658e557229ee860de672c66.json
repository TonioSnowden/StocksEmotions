  "text": "<p>That means we weren't able to touch and feel the innovations like in years past -- although we did get some stuff sent to our homes. Still, it hasn't stopped us from bringing you the craziest, coolest and kookiest gadgets we could find.</p><p>Vuzix Next-Generation Smart Glasses</p><p>We've heard the future promised over and over: a sleek pair of augmented-reality glasses that ideally don't resemble ski goggles. Vuzix's new specs sure look like that promise. The prescription-ready glasses have two tiny projectors that use micro-LED technology to display digital information in front of you. An Android-based operating system, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will allow it to run apps that you control via gestures. The company hasn't revealed much more, but given Vuzix's focus on enterprise, we aren't expecting consumer-friendly pricing. Available later this year; vuzix.com</p><p>MyQ Pet Portal</p><p>Who let the dog out? Finally, there's a high-tech answer: this self-opening pet door for indoor-outdoor cats and dogs. We've seen lots of gadgets that allow humans to interact with their pets remotely, including automated feeders, pet cams and laser pointers. At last, there's a Wi-Fi-enabled door with a built-in camera and two-way audio, controllable through an app. A Bluetooth sensor attached to your pet's collar can also open the door at close range. Embedded safety sensors mean fuzzy friends won't get stuck upon exit or re-entry. Doors come in different materials and require professional installation. Available for preorder now and shipping this spring for $2,999 to $4,500; myqpetportal.com</p><p>FallCall Detect Smartwatch App</p><p>Some models of the Apple Watch can already tell when the wearer falls. FallCall's app improves on the feature by distinguishing between high- and low-impact tumbles and can summon emergency services for the former. A low-impact spill alerts predesignated contacts. The app's best feature is that it even works on models without Apple's own fall detection. A version for Android watches is in the works as well. Available in App Store on Jan. 31; smartfalldetection.com</p><p>Asus 14-inch ZenBook Duo</p><p>Yeah, yeah -- another year, another idea for how a laptop should have another screen. Yet the Asus ScreenPad Plus's tilting second display, which sits right above the top half of the keyboard, appears to be quite useful. Its software makes it easier to multitask, move windows up and down and customize the second screen with specific tools. The 14-inch Windows 10 laptop, powered by the latest Intel processors, also comes with a stylus for sketching and taking notes. Available later this month, starting at $1,000; asus.com</p><p>ColdSnap Rapid-Freezing Machine</p><p>A home soft-serve ice-cream dispenser is . . . the future? We went through a few phases of thought when confronted with the ColdSnap: Sure, the company's Keurig-style business model is a way to hook customers, maybe even into a dreaded subscription. But while there are a million ways to make coffee easily at home, ice cream is harder to just whip up. Besides, the environmental argument is hard to beat: Why freeze ice cream at the start -- and use energy to keep it frozen through the whole distribution chain -- when you can just freeze it for 60 to 90 seconds right before serving? Oh, and the device also does margaritas. We look forward to reviewing this. Available this year for around $500; coldsnap.com</p><p>Filo Tata Pad and Tata Band</p><p>Filo's Tata Pad and Tata Band address a problem parents don't even want to imagine: accidentally leaving their baby or toddler in the car. You can choose either the pad (which sits on the car-seat cushion) or the band (which wraps around the seat belt). Both are equipped with sensors and Bluetooth to communicate with a smartphone app. If a child is still in the seat but the phone isn't nearby, the device sends a notification and sounds an alarm. Available in the fall, each for around $60; getmytata.com</p><p>Toto Wellness Toilet</p><p>Mark our words: At-home poop analysis is the future. Toto's Wellness internet-connected toilet concept includes sensors in the fixture's plumbing that can examine fecal matter and offer insights on nutrition and even recipes through a mobile app. So if you're not eating enough fiber, for example, Toto can encourage you to stock up on beans and lentils. The toilet's seat also measures vital information through the skin on your legs, such as heart rate. Potentially available in the coming years, price TBD; totousa.com</p><p>Samsung Bot Handy and JetBot 90 AI+</p><p>Never again will you be scolded for putting the forks in the dishwasher the wrong way. Instead, point the finger at Samsung's Bot Handy. The rolling robot looks straight out of the Jetsons' house, cruising around to pick up and put away objects. Advanced AI allows it to decide how much force to use to grasp objects made of different materials, says Samsung. Bot Handy is very much in the development stage. What is due this year: the JetBot 90 AI+, Samsung's newest autonomous vacuum, which has a camera to avoid obstacles and keep an eye on your house when you're out. Pricing TBD; samsung.com</p>",
