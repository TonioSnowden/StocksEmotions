Now it is an asset class,” he said. “There are no permanent friends or permanent enemies any more.”</p> <p>The much-feared Apollo is now often the first or second financing call for a competitor looking to buy a publicly traded company. Would-be competitors find their best chance to buy or sell assets comes from each other. Collaboration is also the quickest way to grow assets and lucrative management fees, or realise profits ahead of another fundraising. </p> <p>Since Rowan's comments, DD has been looking for the perfect example of how these new social cues work.</p> <p><strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong> and <strong>Permira</strong>'s $10bn takeover of software group <strong>Zendesk</strong> in June was mostly unremarkable. The company sells “customer service software and sales CRM”.</p> <p>But it was a culmination of a web of complex relationships built over the past decade between firms that has led to tens of billions of dollars in activity, massive windfalls and the deployment of enormous amounts of capital.</p> <p>Antoine's feature sketches it all out in great detail, including new information such as <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s initial consideration of participating in a consortium that was looking to source an equity cheque totalling more than $10bn.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10855326.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Zendesk is just a small example within a systematic change in finance, which is pulling an ever-greater share of activity to private markets.</p> <p>With banks mostly sidelined from financing markets due to hung loans, initial public offerings frozen, and corporations hesitant to strike deals, it's private equity firms that are driving activity.</p> <p>The industry's share of M&amp;A has never been higher. A string of deals — each worth about $10bn — have now been struck without the use of banks. Billions more in liquidity has been realised by PE sellers without the need for public markets.</p> <p>With increased power comes regulation. The biggest M&amp;A story of the year, broken by the DD's James Fontanella-Khan and the FT's Stefania Palma, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f4cc882-1444-4ea3-8a31-c382364aace1\">is a more hostile approach</a> taken to private equity deals by regulators such as the <strong>US Department of Justice </strong>and<strong> Federal Trade Commission</strong>.</p> <p>Outside threats like regulation underscore that the new bonds and increased power of private equity firms are yet to be fully tested by challenges such as a deep recession.</p> <h1>The British law firms trying to crack America</h1> <p>DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57de05b8-adfc-45a7-8acb-dd5250d6121a\">has explained</a> over the past few years how US law firms have been raiding British talent as they edge in on UK law firms' territory. Backed by a stronger dollar, a larger domestic market and a nonstop work ethic, firms like <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> and<strong> Latham &amp; Watkins </strong>are becoming features of the UK market, not sideshows. </p> <p>But what about the UK firms that have tried to go the other way?</p> <p>London's “magic circle” (a group of prestigious firms including <strong>Clifford Chance</strong>, <strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer </strong>and <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong>) have mostly failed to make their mark on the world's biggest and most profitable legal market, despite entering New York as early as the 1970s.&#xa0;</p> <p>They're now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b987678-bc32-4d78-a71b-1a1a3b592ace\">staging an expensive push</a> to compete with America's most powerful law firms on their own turf, including by breaking pay ceilings to lure star partners and moving into the west coast to target Silicon Valley clients, the FT's Kate Beioley reports.</p> <p>Freshfields hired<strong> Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</strong> deals star <strong>Ethan Klingsberg </strong>in 2019 for a reputed $10mn a year — far higher than its previous pay rules would allow. Allen &amp; Overy has launched four new offices since the start of 2021, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and hired 40 US partners in the past two and a half years. </p> <p>The potential prize is huge. Although the “magic circle” dominates in Europe, being a truly global heavyweight means cracking the US, too. They're making headway: Allen &amp; Overy boosted its share of US revenue from 9 to 13 per cent between its 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years. Freshfields has scored a spot on notable deals for<strong> Google </strong>and<strong> AstraZeneca</strong>.</p> <p>But the path to US domination is fraught with risks. In the US, deep ties to private equity groups mean outfits such as Kirkland are able to hand partners far higher sums than magic circle profits and pay structures allow. </p> <p>US hopefuls Clifford Chance, Allen &amp; Overy, Freshfields and Linklaters have all made changes to the “lockstep” remuneration model that has for decades dictated partners' pay based on time served, rather than performance.</p> <p>In 2020, Allen &amp; Overy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c27f14e0-03f6-4c5c-9988-0cc8dac93016\">extended the range of “equity points”</a> (aka profit entitlements) that could be awarded to star lawyers from its previous range of 20 to 50 equity points. Those points, then worth about £45,000, paired with the firm's extension of its bonus pool improved its American hiring prospects. </p> <p>But weakening those rules to splash the cash is no guarantee that star hires will stick around, and offering outsized pay deals in one country risks aggravating partners in another. </p> <p>Long-term growth will depend on whether the magic circle can boost profit and productivity too, something US law firms are renowned for. In the words of Clifford Chance's former managing partner <strong>Tony Williams</strong>: “They're making good progress, but they're not yet transforming the market.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h1>Capital markets lawyers kick their feet up</h1> <p>As a near two-year marathon of IPOs, blank-cheque deals and megamergers slows, capital markets lawyers are <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3bBi9Dm\">experiencing an unfamiliar sensation</a>: free time.</p> <p>Many lawyers are finally finding time to walk down the aisle after putting off wedding plans during the rush of listings in 2020 and 2021, <strong>Skadden Arps</strong>'s global head of capital markets <strong>David Goldschmidt</strong> told the FT.</p> <p>Staff at <strong>Paul Weiss</strong>, <strong>Fried Frank</strong> and Skadden, who were told they can work remotely for three or four weeks over August, may be settling into vacation rentals for dips in the pool over the lunch breaks they'll actually use.</p> <p>The industry remains hopeful that the markets hangover will eventually subside. <strong>Peter Giacchi</strong>, who runs <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>' floor trading team at The New York Stock Exchange, said more clarity on interest rate rises from the <strong>Federal Reserve </strong>next month could open a short window for listings before November's US midterm elections.</p> <p>Grocery delivery app <strong>Instacart</strong> and <strong>Mobileye</strong>, the self-driving car unit of chipmaker <strong>Intel</strong>, are expected to be first out of the gate.</p> <p>But the tentative listings do little to help firms' current cash crunch.</p> <p>The cheap-money era has left many companies with enough cash to keep them out of the red for now, meaning fewer restructurings and corporate collapses to tide law firms over until the IPO market picks back up.</p> <p>Not everyone is losing out. The IPO drought could trigger an increase in structured deals such as pre-IPO convertible notes that can be used to raise capital without accepting a lower valuation through a traditional equity raise, said several bankers, setting private markets dealmakers up for a win.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer </strong>has hired private credit lawyer <strong>Lisa Stevens</strong> as a restructuring partner in London. She joins from Kirkland &amp; Ellis.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati </strong>has hired <strong>Joseph Slights III</strong>, a former vice-chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, as a member of its corporate governance practice in Wilmington, Delaware.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>White &amp; Case </strong>has hired M&amp;A lawyer <strong>Di Yu </strong>as a partner in London. She joins from law firm <strong>Slaughter and May</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Rough seas ahead </strong>Carpet king Geoff Wilding managed to turn £20,000 into superyacht money through a controversial derivatives bet with the 120-year-old flooring group he chairs.
