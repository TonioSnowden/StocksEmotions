  "title": "Companies Make EEOC Diversity Disclosures Public Amid Investor Pressure; Companies are required to report workplace diversity information to the government, and most of the S&P 100 are now voluntarily making it public",
  "text": "<p>Some investors are pushing companies to make their disclosures public.</p><p>\"You already have the data, you're already tracking it, so now we want to see it so that we can actually assess for ourselves what the company's journey is,\" said Gwen Le Berre, director of responsible investing at Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC. \"The only thing we are asking for is a higher level of transparency.\"</p><p>Investors say the standardized forms—called EEO-1 reports—display comparisons between companies, show year-over-year progress, and may provide more detailed or reliable information than voluntary disclosures, which vary between companies and industries.</p><p>Disclosing EEO-1 data is becoming the norm for the largest public companies. Some 78 companies in the S&amp;P 100 market index disclosed EEO-1 representation data as of August, up from 20 last year, according to corporate accountability nonprofit As You Sow.</p><p>Disclosure rose rapidly as businesses came under pressure to improve their stance on racial-justice issues amid protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last year. Institutions including the New York City comptroller's office, which manages some $266 billion in retirement funds for city employees, and investment firm Calvert Research &amp; Management Inc., which manages around $36 billion and is owned by Morgan Stanley, last year called for companies to make the data public.</p><p>Fewer smaller companies disclose the data. Just Capital, a not-for-profit that tracks how corporations treat workers, said 6.4% of the 928 companies it tracked in the Russell 1000 market index disclosed an EEO-1 report as of January 2021. Parametric, which has around $410 billion under management, in August started asking 50 companies in the S&amp;P 500 in which it is invested to disclose EEO-1 data, Ms. Le Berre said.</p><p>EEO-1 forms aren't a perfect window into workplace diversity. Although they indicate which categories of people do different kinds of work, they haven't historically included pay data. In 2016, the EEOC voted to collect data for 2017 and 2018 showing how many workers in different job types and diversity categories fell into different salary bands, creating a separate disclosure. But future collection of that data would require another vote.</p><p>Some companies say their own diversity disclosures are more informative because the worker categories on the EEO-1 form don't reflect the nuances of their business or industry. The disclosures also don't include information about workers outside the U.S. EEOC spokeswoman Christine Nazer said the commission encourages voluntary disclosure where it can help improve diversity and inclusion, but said the data doesn't always give a full picture.</p><p>Intel Corp. has been disclosing EEO-1 representation data since 2002, and in 2019 released associated pay data for 2017 and 2018. It later published 2019 pay data in the same format even though the EEOC hasn't required companies to report that year.</p><p>\"Disclosing information can be an intimidating process,\" said Dawn Jones, the chip maker's diversity chief. \"We open ourselves up to being critiqued.\"</p><p>But Ms. Jones said public disclosure created accountability. In 2019, Intel said it reached \"gender pay equity\" globally and maintained \"race and ethnicity pay equity\" in the U.S. The company defines this as closing the gap between the average pay of employees of different genders or ethnicities, where data is available, in the same or similar roles after accounting for factors such as performance and tenure.</p><p>Many recent investor resolutions related to workplace diversity have included calls for the disclosure of EEO-1 reports. Investors withdrew some 25 such resolutions this year after reaching agreements with companies, according to the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute.</p><p>Three resolutions made it to shareholder ballots.</p><p>Of the three, the only resolution that didn't gain majority support was at cable company Charter Communications Inc., where nearly 41% of shareholders supported the proposal, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute. A Charter spokesperson declined to comment beyond what the company's board argued, which was that EEO-1 data is limited and does a poor job of accounting for company or industry-specific roles and inaccurately measures its diversity progress, among other reasons.</p><p>Union Pacific Corp. in August published the last three years of its EEO-1 representation data after a resolution won more than 86% support from shareholders. The railroad operator's board had opposed the resolution, saying the diversity information it provides every quarter is \"more comprehensive in that it covers a greater portion of our workforce and our D&amp;I efforts than the EEO-1 report does,\" among other reasons.</p><p>Union Pacific's quarterly update puts nonwhite ethnicities in a catchall minority category and doesn't show the gender makeup of people in different ethnic groups. Union Pacific's most recent EEO-1 report gave more detail, showing that Black and Hispanic people held about 5.4% and 4.9%, respectively, of senior and midlevel management roles across a workforce of 34,199 at the end of 2020. Black and Hispanic people made up around 13% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. population in 2019, according to the U.S. census.</p><p>\"We appreciate hearing from shareholders and value their feedback, which is why we published the data for 2018, 2019 and 2020,\" a Union Pacific spokeswoman said.</p><p>The board of Kevlar maker DuPont de Nemours Inc. opposed a proposal asking for EEO-1 disclosure that won nearly 84% of support from shareholders in late April, but a DuPont spokesperson said the company now plans to publish its 2020 EEO-1 data in October after consulting with investors and other stakeholders.</p><p>Ms. Le Berre of money manager Parametric said some companies are worried that disclosing EEO-1 data would make them look bad. But she said transparency can help win over investors.</p><p>\"I hate the idea of companies thinking that investors are going to judge them at this point on where they are in the journey, because what we really want to see is transparency and progress over time,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Companies Make EEOC Diversity Disclosures Public Amid Investor Pressure</p>",
