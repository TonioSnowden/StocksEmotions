  "text": "<p>Nvidia said Wednesday that sales for the third quarter rose 50% to $7.1 billion, generating net income of $2.46 billion. The figures surpassed Wall Street expectations, with analysts surveyed by FactSet estimating the company would bring in $6.8 billion in revenue and $2.27 billion in net income. Revenue was buoyed by record gaming sales of $3.2 billion, up 42% from the year-ago period.</p><p>Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company fell 3.1% to $292.61. They rose more than 2% in aftermarket trading following the results.</p><p>The strong results come in the face of a global semiconductor shortage that has dented sales of a diverse range of products, including gaming consoles and cars. Wait times for some types of processors are reaching record lengths and buyers are hoarding products. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said he thinks the shortage could last into 2023.</p><p>Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang also has been pushing the company into new markets, with increasing business providing chips for cars at a time vehicles use more processors. The company this year also said it would offer central processing units for data centers in a challenge to Intel.</p><p>Nvidia last year agreed to buy chip-design specialist Arm Holdings for around $40 billion in a deal that would further expand its reach. The deal still awaits regulatory approval and has drawn opposition from customers of U.K.-based Arm. The British government this week extended a probe into the deal, citing what it said were \"significant competition concerns.\" Nvidia has defended its planned purchase and said it wouldn't stifle competition.</p><p>Mr. Huang now has his sights set onthe so-called metaverse, a loosely defined group of online realms where users playing as avatars can hang out and participate in immersive experiences with others. Nvidia is offering software called Omniverse Enterprise that offers collaboration and simulation tools such as the ability to create interactive artificial-intelligence avatars. The company has billed the set of tools as foundational to creating and connecting virtual worlds and customers can gain access to them on a subscription basis. Mr. Huang has said he thinks the metaverse economy has the potential to be bigger than the current one.</p><p>Nvidia on Wednesday said it expects $7.4 billion in sales for the current quarter, beating forecasts.</p><p>Nvidia Posts Record Revenue as Videogaming Sales Soar</p>",
