  "title": "Biden Plan to Combat Inflation with U.S. Manufacturing Faces Skepticism; While supply-chain disruptions contributed to pandemic price increases, economists say low-cost foreign goods helped keep costs down for decades",
  "text": "<p>Some economists and analysts are skeptical that a Biden administration push to increase domestic manufacturing will have the White House's intended effect of meaningfully taming inflation.</p><p>Administration officials have said that increasing domestic manufacturing would insulate the U.S. from the kinds of global supply disruptions that occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic and helped fuel inflation, which is at a 40-year high of near 8%, and is poised to see more upward pressure tied to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p>Offshore production, however, contributed to the moderate price increases Americans broadly saw for decades prior to the pandemic, economists said. From 1990 to 2019, average annual inflation was 2.4%, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index.</p><p>Chad Syverson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, said companies moved production of certain manufactured goods to countries where labor and other costs are lower.</p><p>\"That in turn has been passed on in the form of lower prices to consumers,\" Mr. Syverson said.</p><p>\"If it already were the case that it's massively cheaper to produce that stuff here rather than offshore, they would have already moved production back,\" he added. \"There are reasons why you might want to reshore, but short-run price effects are not anywhere near the top of the list.\"</p><p>The White House is rolling out several policies aimed at increasing domestic manufacturing. While combating inflation is a goal, President Biden has placed an emphasis on bolstering U.S. manufacturing since early in his tenure.</p><p>The White House said last month that Mr. Biden would authorize the use of the Defense Production Act to support domestic production of materials used for electric vehicles and other clean-energy technology. The administration recently finalized a rule tightening regulations surrounding the federal government's purchases of items produced or manufactured in the U.S. The White House is also pushing Congress to settle on a bipartisan compromise on legislation aimed at shoring up domestic supply chains, particularly for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and boosting U.S. competitiveness with China and other nations.</p><p>Sameera Fazili, deputy director at the White House National Economic Council, said that the administration's efforts had the potential to have an impact on inflation in the short term by signaling to the private sector that there will be a favorable policy environment for domestic manufacturing.</p><p>\"When you send a signal, the private sector can more quickly deploy its investments,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Fazili said the White House is taking a nuanced approach to the industries its domestic-manufacturing push is targeting.</p><p>\"The answer to every resiliency problem is not necessarily ramping up domestic production,\" Ms. Fazili said. \"But you have certain cases like semiconductors where it's very clear that micro shocks, given the structure of the supply chain, can have macro implications\" for inflation.</p><p>A global semiconductor shortage during the pandemic contributed to higher prices for items such as vehicles and some consumer electronics.</p><p>The shortage has prompted the administration to especially focus on messaging around expanding the domestic semiconductor industry's capacity, highlighting recent announcements by companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. to build new chip-production facilities in the U.S. Those companies have said operations at the new sites won't come online until 2024 and 2025, respectively.</p><p>\"It takes a long time for [semiconductor] companies to expand their capacity, to build new plants or to add new production lines,\" said Chad Bown, an economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>Mr. Bown said the factors that led to the semiconductor shortage were related to pandemic-specific circumstances—including strong demand for chips as consumers clamored for items such as electronics—and not the level of U.S production specifically.</p><p>\"It's not clear to me that even if we had more fabrication of semiconductors in the United States that we would be really in any different situation than we are today,\" Mr. Bown said.</p><p>Mr. Bown said the administration's efforts to promote domestic semiconductor production would likely do more to address national-security concerns and geographic diversification of supply chains, rather than help cool inflation.</p><p>Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters this week that increasing domestic semiconductor production would be important for addressing economic vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy stemming from an overreliance on foreign-produced chips.</p><p>\"The risks are profound,\" Mr. Deese said.</p><p>More broadly, the U.S. trade deficit in 2021 hit a record high, a sign of a continued heavy reliance on imports from China and other countries.</p><p>Scott Paul, president of the advocacy group Alliance for American Manufacturing, said some companies are accounting for political and trade tensions as they consider the costs of producing goods in places like China.</p><p>\"I do think that the cost calculus has changed when you do a total accounting of the cost of production, and I think that will influence some, not all, decisions,\" he said.</p><p>Increasing domestic manufacturing capacity could address supply-chain bottlenecks, while ultimately boosting some Americans' purchasing power by creating jobs, Mr. Paul added.</p><p>The U.S. economy added 365,000 manufacturing jobs in 2021, according to Labor Department data, and the sector saw modest gains following the 2007-2009 recession. Still, in the past decade, less than 10% of U.S. jobs were in the manufacturing industry, compared with roughly a third at the end of World War II. Technological advancements and automation have also contributed to manufacturing's declining share of overall U.S. employment, economists said.</p><p>Within days of taking office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order aimed at strengthening rules around the federal government's procurement of American-made products. The administration recently finalized those Buy American rules, which will lift the domestic-content threshold for products for federal procurement to 75% by 2029 from 55% previously, among other measures.</p><p>Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the administration's efforts to link their policy push on U.S. manufacturing to fighting inflation reflected an \"attempt to recast pre-existing policies.\"</p><p>\"The administration's Buy America policies, some of their reshoring policies, it's notable that those were their policies back before anyone was talking about this inflationary boom.\"</p><p>Ms. Fazili said the administration had always considered the potential for various benefits tied to increased domestic production: \"It's not an argument of convenience.\"</p><p>Write to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Plan to Combat Inflation with U.S. Manufacturing Faces Skepticism</p>",
