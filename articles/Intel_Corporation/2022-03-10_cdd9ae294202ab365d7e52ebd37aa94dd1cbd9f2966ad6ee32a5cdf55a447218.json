  "text": "<p>Q Madam Vice President, each day we can see death and unimaginable suffering of the Ukraine people caused by decisions made by Vladimir Putin. My question is: Will the U.S. support an international investigation into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine? And can you see any political future for Putin?</p><p>(As interpreted.) This is also the question to the Polish President.</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay, I'll go.</p><p>PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to himself.)</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You go this time, please. (Laughs.)</p><p>Q (Inaudible) I will start with Madam Vice President.</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: (Laughs.) Okay.</p><p>PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to Vice President Harris.)</p><p>Q Thank you. I appreciate that. (Laughter.)</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Not at all. I — we are very clear: The NATO Alliance is stronger and Russia is weaker because of what Putin has done. That is very clear to us.</p><p>And when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation. The U.N. has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary.</p><p>Sometimes there are awkward moments when one is not quite sure whose turn it is to speak, but the amused tone from the vice president continued later in the press conference:</p><p>Q Thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President. I wanted to ask you about some reporting that my colleague here in Poland noticed. He recently spoke with the mayor of the largest border town, who told him that the refugee system is essentially not set up for this, that it will collapse. It's an improvised system that can work for maybe two weeks, but not indefinitely. And I'm wondering what the United States is going to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure. And relatedly, is the United States willing to make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees?</p><p>And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to specifically accept more refugees.</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay. (Laughs.) A friend in need is a friend indeed. (Laughter.)</p><p>PRESIDENT DUDA: Okay. I'll go first. Okay, so this time — (as interpreted) — Madam, the situation is very complex. This is what I was saying today and I discussed this at length with Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. I said, in a very blunt way, that today we are seeing a refugee crisis.</p><p>President Duda continued to describe a massive human tragedy that given its volume could completely overwhelm his country and create a \"refugee disaster\". The Journal's Drew Hinshaw and Ian Lovett report today from Warsaw:</p><p>Local governments can't buy beds fast enough. Poles who offer to host refugees get more than 100 emails from newcomers looking for a place to sleep, often full of details of their ordeal. The flood of people has raised Poland's population for the first time since 1987...</p><p>Two Ukrainians enter Poland every three seconds. The 1.4 million people who have arrived in Poland would create the country's second-largest city. By next week, they will likely surpass Warsaw, the country's biggest city, Polish officials expect.</p><p>At the press conference, President Duda noted that he had told Vice President Harris that Poland needs immediate financial and material assistance as well as technical assistance because it lacks experience in managing such an enormous flow of migrants. He added:</p><p>Furthermore, we discussed the refugees from Ukraine who have got relatives and families in the United States, and who would be willing — at least for the time when the war is still waging, they would like to visit those families, to stay with their families in the United States, and to wait there until the war is over and then come back to their homes.</p><p>I asked to speed up and simplify the procedures for such people — the consular procedures to be simplified for those people who would like to leave for the United States, to give the opportunity to these people to see their families as soon as possible, to be reunited with their families, to help them to survive this time.</p><p>When it was her turn to speak again, fortunately Ms. Harris did not laugh at the idea, but she also made no commitment, offering vague assurances of help and noting only assistance for Ukrainians who were already in the U.S.:</p><p>You probably know that we have made a decision as it relates to TPS — the Temporary Protected Status. So for Ukrainians that are in the United States whose visa may expire or has expired: If they were in the United States before — I believe it's March; I don't have the exact date — they will be able to stay; they won't be required to leave, even though their visa has expired because, of course, we would not send them back to what is a warzone.</p><p>The vice president should immediately seek the president's approval to welcome refugees from the war zone, especially those who already have family ties to the U.S. And let's not assume their moves should be temporary. Stuart Anderson reminds us today of another refugee from another invasion by Russian troops who came to settle with family in America. After the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, Andrew Grove, then known as Andras Grof, set off on his journey:</p><p>With the help of a family friend, Grove made his escape. He took a long train ride and trekked over land through a dozen villages, evading Russian patrols before reaching Austria.</p><p>In Vienna, thousands of Hungarians stood in line at the U.S. consulate and at refugee organizations. At the consulate, he gave the names of an aunt and uncle, Lenke and Lajos, who lived in New York City. He interviewed with a representative of the International Rescue Committee but found out days later his name was not on the list for acceptance to the U.S.</p><p>After being rejected, Grove did something remarkable: He didn't take \"no\" for an answer. What followed raises the question of whether refugees who gain admission to other countries are, to an extent, \"self-selected\" for characteristics such as fortitude and risk-taking. In other words, are refugees who are resettled in the United States and western countries the most resilient even among a group of resilient displaced people?</p><p>Grove ran to a school where he heard a different group of International Rescue Committee staff were conducting interviews. \"I swiped the sweat off my face with my hands and, still panting, started talking in English as fast as I could,\" writes Grove. \"I explained that I had been interviewed yesterday, that I was not selected, but that I really, really wanted to go to the United States. One of the interviewers asked me why. I told him I had relatives in New York City who would take me in, that I was a chemistry student, and I thought I would become a good chemist, and that I belonged in the United States.</p><p>\"The words poured out, not eloquently or coherently, but I talked and talked as if I could overwhelm their objections by the sheer volume of my words. I almost didn't dare to stop talking, but finally I ran out of things to say. I stood there, panting slightly still sweating profusely. The students looked at each other and smiled, then one said, 'Okay, you can go to the United States.' I was speechless. I couldn't believe my good fortune. I wanted to hug every one of the young men sitting on the other side of the long table.\"</p><p>The good fortune was America's. Grove died in 2016 but not before an immensely productive career culminating with a long tenure as CEO of Intel.</p><p>The next Andrew Grove might be crossing the border into Poland right now. But even if we don't land another Grove, with more than 11 million open positions in the U.S. right now we're bound to find some helpful hands. Given the hell they've just endured, can you imagine a more grateful group of employees?</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>***</p><p>Welcome Ukrainians</p>",
