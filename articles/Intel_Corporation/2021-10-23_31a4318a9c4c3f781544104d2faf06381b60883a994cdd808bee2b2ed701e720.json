  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Intel Looks to the Future By Delivering the Bad News Now --- The chip maker's early warning of shrinking margins allows it to focus on its revival, but the road ahead looks difficult",
  "text": "<p>The chip-making giant said late Thursday that it expects annual gross margins to fall into the 51%-53% range for the next two to three years, a substantial comedown. Intel's gross margins have typically been above the 60% mark over the past decade. The company has been pursuing an expensive turnaround plan, seeking to catch up to its rivals in the most advanced production processes and open a foundry business to make chips designed by other companies.</p><p>The announcement came during the company's call to discuss its third-quarter results, which were also unimpressive. Intel's data-center segment posted 10% sales growth but missed Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and operating profit. Sales on the company's PC side contracted after seven straight quarters of gains. Intel is facing the same constraints as other chip makers in shortages of key supplies, while its PC-producing customers are held down by their own component shortages plus cooling demand. Intel shares fell 12% Friday, their first trading session after the results and call, to close at $49.46, their lowest price of the year.</p><p>The revised margin projection wasn't a major surprise. Many analysts had been anticipating a gross-margin decline as part of the company's turnaround plan, with some even projecting a drop below the 50% mark -- which Intel hasn't seen in 20 years. But most were expecting the company to give those details at an analyst meeting scheduled for next month. However, with a search under way to replace retiring George Davis as chief financial officer, Intel said Thursday that it has decided to delay that meeting until February, so it delivered the bad news early. That postponement will give whoever takes over the job an opportunity to participate in the company's planning process -- and avoid having to drop a bomb so early in their tenure.</p><p>Intel will still have plenty of tough questions to address when the time comes. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said Wednesday he believes Intel's nascent foundry business can eventually have a \"very similar margin structure to the leader in this business today\" -- meaning Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. But TSMC has typically commanded lower gross margins than Intel, averaging just below 50% over the past five years.</p><p>And the cost for chip makers to stay competitive will keep rising. TSMC affirmed in its own third-quarter report earlier this month that it intends to have about $30 billion in capital expenditure this year compared with Intel's projected range of $18 billion to $19 billion. Memory-chip maker Micron announced new long-term investment plans this past week that also represent a substantial step up relative to its history.</p><p>U.S. chip makers remain hopeful for direct government support. Mr. Gelsinger said that moving the analyst meeting back will also give the company \"a better view of the government investments from which we expect to benefit.\" Ultimately, though, Intel will have to convince investors that it has the technical chops to regain pole position. Without that, checks from Uncle Sam will only go so far.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
