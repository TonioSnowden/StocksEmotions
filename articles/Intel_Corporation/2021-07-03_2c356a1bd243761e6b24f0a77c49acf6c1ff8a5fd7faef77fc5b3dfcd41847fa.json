  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking -- Pro Move / Intel From An Ex-Line Cook: Baked, Not Fried. Still Fierce --- These Korean-style chicken wings emerge from the oven so shatteringly crisp, you'd swear they came straight from a fryer. Yet the cleanup is so much kinder.",
  "text": "<p>The chicken-wing recipe below manages to mimic the magical crunch of Korean fried chicken as well as the nooks and crannies that so capably capture a sauce, minus the film of fryer grease that clings to every surface -- even, seemingly, to the air. And it all comes down to a few small but powerful moves.</p><p>First, you toss the wings in a dry brine of baking powder, salt, black pepper, corn starch, and onion and garlic powders. Then you let the chicken rest overnight in the refrigerator on a wire rack atop a baking sheet. You want the surface of those wings dry for optimal crisping, so leave them uncovered; the moisture drawn out by the salt in the brine will gradually evaporate. The baking powder raises the pH level, which does wonders for browning. And as the chicken brines, the baking powder and the protein-infused juices extracted from the chicken combine to create a coating that bubbles during cooking. Tiny pockets of carbon dioxide trapped within the browning crust translate to a crackle so intense you would naturally assume it was produced by a fryer, not an oven.</p><p>I love the efficiency of this recipe. No need to transfer the brined wings to another cooking vessel: The same wire rack they rest on becomes a boon during baking, facilitating the flow of air and heat around the chicken for even crisping. (If you're working with a conventional oven as opposed to the convection kind, it's important to keep flipping the wings to get the full effect.)</p><p>I favor a tangy sauce inspired by a recipe my sister developed. Given a thorough tossing, these wings possess the structural integrity to maintain their crunch while drinking it up. Even leftovers remain impressively crispy after a day or two. And as any fried-chicken aficionado will attest, you always want to make a batch big enough to ensure there will be some left to eat straight from the fridge.</p><p>---</p><p>Baked Korean Fried Chicken</p><p>Air-drying the wings in a dry brine made with baking powder helps to mimic the crisping effects of frying, but in the oven -- without the stress, mess and bubbling oil.</p><p>Total Time: 9 1/4 hours (includes overnight brining)</p><p>Serves: 6-8</p><p>For the chicken:</p><p>3 1/2 pounds chicken wings, separated into drumettes and flats</p><p>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p><p>2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</p><p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p><p>1/4 cup corn starch</p><p>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</p><p>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</p><p>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</p><p>For the sauce:</p><p>1 1/2 tablespoons neutral oil such as grapeseed oil</p><p>4 garlic cloves, grated</p><p>1 1/2-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated</p><p>1/2 cup corn syrup</p><p>1/4 cup soy sauce</p><p>1 tablespoon white vinegar</p><p>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</p><p>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</p><p>2 teaspoons gochujang</p><p>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</p><p>For the garnish (optional):</p><p>2 scallions, thinly sliced</p><p>Thinly sliced pickled jalapenos or fresh red chiles</p><p>1. Pat chicken wings completely dry and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together baking powder, salt, black pepper, corn starch, onion powder and garlic powder. Add chicken wings and toss to coat thoroughly and evenly all over. Gently press coating onto each chicken wing to ensure it sticks. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set a baking rack on top of the baking sheet. Transfer chicken wings to prepared rack/baking sheet and set in refrigerator, uncovered, to dry-brine for at least 8 hours or overnight.</p><p>2. When you're ready to cook, preheat oven to 450 degrees. Keeping rack-baking sheet setup intact, transfer wings to oven and bake for 20 minutes. Flip wings and return to oven to bake, flipping wings twice more during baking, until deeply golden brown all over, about 35 minutes more. Remove chicken from oven and let rest about 5 minutes before tossing with sauce.</p><p>3. Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic has slightly crisped, about 5 minutes. Add corn syrup, soy sauce, white vinegar and yellow mustard, and bring to a simmer. Add brown sugar and gochujang, and stir to combine. Continue cooking until sugar completely dissolves, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.</p><p>4. In a large bowl, combine chicken, sesame seeds and sauce, and toss to coat. Garnish with scallions, if using, and toss again. Add pickled jalapenos, if using, and toss once more.</p>",
