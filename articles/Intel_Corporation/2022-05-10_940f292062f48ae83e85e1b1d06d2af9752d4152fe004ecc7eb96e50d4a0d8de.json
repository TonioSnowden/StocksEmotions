  "title": "Three Friends' Chats  Fed the Steele Dossier  ---  The report of supposed Trump-Kremlin ties  often echoed pals' gossip and hearsay  ----  By Alan Cullison and Aruna Viswanatha",
  "text": "<p>   Hours after the publication in early 2017 of a dossier claiming President-elect Donald Trump conspired with Russia to steer the U.S. election, a public relations executive in Washington tapped out an email to a client whose company was cited in the document, cast as a villain. </p><p>   \"I'm hoping that this is exposed as fake news,\" Charles Dolan Jr. wrote. \"I will check with some folks in the intel world to see if they know who produced this.\" The dossier, published by BuzzFeed News, used code names to conceal its sources. Some were close to Kremlin corridors of power, it said. </p><p>   The dossier proceeded to rivet the U.S. political class, win credibility within the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cast a shadow over the first two years of the Trump presidency and cost millions of dollars for investigations and lawsuits, only to eventually be mostly discredited. One reason was where much of the dossier's information came from -- anything but Kremlin insiders. </p><p>   Instead, a Wall Street Journal review found, many of the dossier's key details originated with a few people gossiping after they had been brought together over a minor corporate publicity contract. </p><p>   The dossier's author, former British spy Christopher Steele , relied mainly on a Washington researcher to gather information. According to FBI notes of an interview with that researcher, Igor Danchenko, he said he wasn't comfortable with the assignment and some of his sources were old friends -- one a former schoolmate -- whose information Mr. Steele exaggerated. </p><p>   It wasn't until last November that prosecutors identified a man they pinpoint as one of Mr. Danchenko's most important sources. Based on an indictment of Mr. Danchenko for lying to the FBI about whom he'd talked to, one of his key sources was none other than Mr. Dolan, the PR executive who tried to reassure a client. </p><p>   The indictment says Mr. Danchenko relied on \"PR Executive-1\" for what became a dossier note about upheaval on Mr. Trump's campaign staff. The indictment also suggests that Mr. Danchenko drew on PR Executive-1 -- since confirmed to be Mr. Dolan -- for part of the dossier's most lurid allegation, that Russian agents once secretly videotaped prostitutes cavorting in Mr. Trump's Moscow hotel room. </p><p>   Mr. Trump has denied that ever happened, and denied other allegations in the dossier as well. Special Counsel Robert Mueller included no evidence of such a hotel episode in the lengthy report of his investigation of Russian election meddling. </p><p>   Mr. Danchenko has pleaded not guilty to lying to the FBI, and his attorney didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Dolan declined to comment, saying through an attorney it would be inappropriate to speak as long as Mr. Danchenko faces charges. Mr. Steele, who has said the dossier was meant as raw intelligence and never intended for public consumption, didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   How someone like a Washington PR operative could be conflated with a Trump or Kremlin insider goes to the heart of the story behind the dossier. It is one that can be told in greater detail today thanks to particulars of the Danchenko indictment and documents associated with Mr. Dolan's work, as well as to interviews with acquaintances of Mr. Dolan and Mr. Danchenko, which provided the basis for the reporting. </p><p>   Couched in the language of conspiracy and professional spycraft, the dossier quickly became the lexicon of opposition to Mr. Trump, and was devoured by a country hungry for information about a Kremlin effort to influence elections that was real. But the dossier was wrong in nearly all its salient details, and the way it was compiled was far more random, haphazard and amateurish than anyone knew. </p><p>   U.S. government investigations found some evidence that the Trump campaign held furtive meetings with Russians involved in influencing the elections. Mr. Mueller charged dozens of Russian entities and individuals with engaging in a two-pronged attack of disinformation and hacked computers, and described in his report repeated contacts between Russia-linked entities and Trump campaign advisers that happened at around the same time. </p><p>   But Mr. Mueller reported no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia's military intelligence apparatus as it hacked into the email of the Democratic National Committee. The dossier took real events, such as the visit of a Trump adviser to Moscow, and expounded on them by describing meetings with high-level Kremlin officials for which no corroborating evidence surfaced. </p><p>   While investigations and court battles have peeled back many origins of the dossier's claims, any trial of Mr. Danchenko could provide further insight. The special counsel looking into the FBI's handling of the Russia probe, John Durham, continues to investigate. One remaining riddle is whether the dossier's misinformation was purely careless or might have included disinformation sown by the Kremlin itself. </p><p>   By spring 2016, Mr. Danchenko and Mr. Dolan moved in the same social and business circles in Washington, where both worked as consultants. As the presidential campaign gathered steam, they and a third friend overseas, Olga Galkina, spent hours trading the sort of gossip and purported inside knowledge that greases the skids of commercial deals and social interactions in political circles. </p><p>   Mr. Danchenko passed some of this chatter on to his boss, Mr. Steele. In short order, versions of it appeared in the dossier, which Mr. Steele filed in a series of dated memos through the rest of 2016. </p><p>   Mr. Danchenko told the FBI of other people he also spoke to in gathering information for Mr. Steele. Many of his details, however, came through this route, the Journal's review shows. </p><p>   What brought Mr. Danchenko, Mr. Dolan and Ms. Galkina together was a marketing campaign -- funded by the Dolan client whose company was cited in the dossier. </p><p>   He was Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian internet entrepreneur living in Cyprus, who decided in early 2016 to launch a U.S. marketing campaign to burnish the image of his cloud server company. </p><p>   A computer-science prodigy from the Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk, Mr. Gubarev founded his first company at age 24 and a decade later formed a new one, Servers.com, which he hoped would leapfrog competitors with state-of-the-art hardware and a global VPN system. </p><p>   He hired Ms. Galkina, also Russian-born, as his press secretary and in early 2016 sent her to Washington to seek someone to promote his business in the U.S. In D.C. Ms. Galkina sought help from Mr. Danchenko, with whom she once attended an elite school in the Russian city of Perm. </p><p>   Mr. Danchenko had spent most of his professional life in the U.S., including years as a researcher for the Brookings Institution. By 2016 he was doing research for Mr. Steele. </p><p>   When Ms. Galkina asked him to suggest a publicist for her employer, Mr. Danchenko emailed his former boss at Brookings, Fiona Hill. \"I have an URGENT small favour to ask you,\" Mr. Danchenko wrote, saying a \"very good old friend of 25 years\" was seeking help from a public relations firm with Russia experience and would be in Washington the next week. </p><p>   Ms. Hill, who later became a top National Security Council Russia expert -- and later still a witness at Mr. Trump's first impeachment hearings -- forwarded the email to Mr. Dolan, the PR executive. After Ms. Galkina arrived in Washington, Mr. Danchenko took her shopping and to a restaurant, say FBI notes of a later interview with the researcher. </p><p>   Mr. Dolan, who goes by Chuck, had spent much of his career in Democratic politics, as a Virginia state chairman in former President Bill Clinton's two presidential campaigns and an adviser on Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire. By 2016 he was working for KGlobal, a communications firm with Republican ties that was trying to develop its international business. </p><p>   It hired him in part for his Russia expertise, say former colleagues. In a previous job, Mr. Dolan represented the Kremlin in a publicity push, including organizing meetings between President Vladimir Putin and Western journalists and experts, giving him access to some high Russian officials. Former colleagues at KGlobal, which didn't respond to requests for comment, said he regaled them with tales of his doings in Russia, such as getting through a police stop by showing a badge indicating he was in the country at Kremlin invitation. </p><p>   Mr. Dolan and Ms. Galkina discussed a marketing campaign for her employer. \"I was very impressed with the level of your professionalism and skills,\" Ms. Galkina emailed Mr. Dolan after she returned to Cyprus. \"For me it was like a 3rd grader from the math school to see the professor from MIT.\" </p><p>   Mr. Gubarev's company flew Mr. Dolan and two KGlobal colleagues to Cyprus in July 2016 and put them up at the Four Seasons hotel so they could deliver a sales pitch, Mr. Gubarev said. With Mr. Trump clinching the Republican nomination in the U.S., the talk in Cyprus wandered into politics. The Danchenko indictment says Mr. Dolan brought Ms. Galina a book by Mrs. Clinton he inscribed \"To my good friend Olga, A Great Democrat.\" Mr. Dolan signed a three-month contract to help Servers.com with \"message development\" and outreach in the U.S. for $25,000 a month. </p><p>   Mr. Danchenko's work for Mr. Steele, which had mostly involved business intelligence, also took a turn toward politics. Mr. Steele, a former agent in Russia for the British intelligence agency MI-6, asked Mr. Danchenko to work on a new assignment Mr. Steele had accepted: to look for compromising material on Mr. Trump in Russia. </p><p>   The assignment came from Fusion GPS, a Washington firm that does investigations for private clients. Republicans opposed to Mr. Trump's bid for the GOP nomination initially hired Fusion, but by this time it was employed by Perkins Coie, a law firm representing Mrs. Clinton's primary campaign and the Democratic National Committee. </p><p></p>",
