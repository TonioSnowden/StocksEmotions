  "title": "When the Chips Are Down, Congress Should Support the Semiconductor Industry; Proposed grants would help consumers and strengthen the economy and U.S. national security.",
  "text": "<p>The pandemic supply-chain shock exposed a problem that had been mounting for years. The U.S. share of global chip manufacturing has declined to 12% from 37% in 1990. South Korea and Taiwan, notably, have spent years actively investing in their own chip manufacturing, creating an uneven playing field for U.S. chip makers that harms our economy and global competitiveness.</p><p>Take the automotive industry. Because of chip shortages, workers at some manufacturing plants have been idled for weeks at a time. Consumers, too, have struggled to find new vehicles, including environmentally friendly electric ones. Some autos today entail more than 1,000 chips each, a number that will increase as cars become more electrified, connected and autonomous.</p><p>The consumer-electronics industry also faces unprecedented disruption. As Covid-19 boosted the need for laptops, PCs, smartphones and other smart devices, manufacturers struggled to procure chips to meet demand. When medical providers turned to online appointments rather than office visits, some patients found webcams out of stock. As our need for technology in professional and social settings increases, so does the nation's need for domestic manufacturing capabilities to prevent disruption.</p><p>Less visible but no less important is the strain the chip shortage puts on our healthcare system. During the pandemic, the shortage of chip-dependent ventilators revealed vulnerabilities in our ability to keep Americans healthy. But the need for chips extends to other technologies patients rely on, including pacemakers, blood-pressure monitors, insulin pumps and defibrillators. If we fail to create reliable access to semiconductors, we will be less able to provide modern medicines to our most vulnerable populations.</p><p>Semiconductors are also critical to national defense. In its 2020 Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress, the Defense Department noted the risks posed by our increasing reliance on foreign technology, such as advanced machine tools, photonic and optical systems, and advanced displays. The report also cited the risk of concentrated semiconductor development and manufacturing in a few East Asian countries.</p><p>The global chip shortage not only endangers our access to essential technology. It also risks eating into Americans' wages in the form of reduced hours and higher consumer prices.</p><p>Fortunately, a solution is within reach. As soon as this week, the Senate will hold a vote on funding the Chips Act, which would provide $52.2 billion in grants to the U.S. semiconductor industry. In addition to boosting production of leading-edge and legacy chips, the act would help level the playing field with global competitors. Without intervention, shortages of chips—including the legacy chips widely used in the auto, medical-device and defense industries—are expected to persist as investment in the U.S. stalls. This legislation is vital to many American industries, including ours, that have dealt with significant disruptions.</p><p>We, along with Messrs. Martha and Taiclet, urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to move quickly to address this crisis. By funding the Chips Act, Congress will help consumers, protect patients and strengthen the American economy and national security.</p><p>Mr. Farley is CEO of Ford Motor Co. Mr. Gelsinger is CEO of Intel.</p><p>When the Chips Are Down, Congress Should Support the Semiconductor Industry</p>",
