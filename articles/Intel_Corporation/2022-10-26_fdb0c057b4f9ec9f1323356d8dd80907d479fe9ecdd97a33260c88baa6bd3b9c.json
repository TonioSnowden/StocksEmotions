  "text": "<p>While Texas Instruments topped Wall Street expectations for the quarter in its report late Tuesday,the company's forecast proved to be a disappointment as the Dallas-based chipmaker highlighted it was plowing forward with its capital buildout.</p><p>Late Tuesday, the company forecast fourth-quarter earnings between $1.83 and $2.11 a share on revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion, down from last year's fourth-quarter earnings of $2.27 a share on revenue of $4.83 billion. Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast consensus earnings of $2.23 a share on revenue of $4.94 billion. By Wednesday morning, the Street consensus had fallen to $2.01 a share on revenue of $4.66 billion.</p><p>Of the 31 analysts who cover Texas Instruments, 11 have buy-grade ratings, 17 have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings. Of those, 13 lowered their price targets, while two raised theirs, resulting in an average price target of $173, down from a previous $180.54, according to FactSet data.</p><p>In a note titled, \"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who has a market perform rating and a $145 price target, said it appears as if the last chip segment hit by the two-year pandemic-driven semiconductor shortage is beginning to catch up with the rest of the sector.</p><p>\"Analog has been one of the last bastions of support in the semi industry recently; apparently those days are done as the macro situation catches up and industrial (along with other end markets) now starts to roll (and Texas Instruments, with less of a channel than many of their competitors, may be a clearer read as to what is actually going on at the customer level),\" Rasgon said.</p><p>Read: Chip stocks could suffer worst year ever as effects of shortage-turned-glut spread</p><p>\"And while automotive remains strong, one has to wonder how long that will last as well (and we continue to see risk stockpiling and overshipment risk within that industry),\" according to the Bernstein analyst.</p><p>\"At this point though it remains a bit early to tell what the characteristics of this one will look like,\" Rasgon said. \"We still like the company fundamentally, but with the downcycle just beginning it feels too early to call the bottom.\"</p><p>In a note titled, \"The Times They Are A-Changin',\" Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, who has an inline rating and a $170 price target, noted this is the first time Texas Instruments revenues have trended negative for the first time in 10 quarters, and that the \"correction\" has arrived with auto the company's only segment expected to grow in the December-ended quarter.</p><p>\"The key questions from here â€” the magnitude and duration of the coming correction (management did not indicate, only seeing cancellations/adjustments to backlog),\" Muse said.</p><p>Also related to auto chips: Mobileye prices IPO above targeted range to raise nearly $1 billion, and most of it will go to Intel</p><p>Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a positive rating and a $195 price target, said he believes \"management is likely embedding a degree of conservatism in the guide.\"</p><p>\"Cancellations were also up during the quarter as customers 'worked to align backlog to their needs,'\" Rolland said. \"While most end-markets appear to be slipping, management was careful to highlight strength in automotive, which we believe could be a lone area of strength in 2023.\"</p><p>Texas Instruments still ranks as one of the best-performing chip stocks year-to-date, with a 16% loss, compared with a 39% drop by the SOX chip index, and a 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Read: PC market in 'steepest' fall since data started being collected in mid-1990s, analysts agree</p><p>Earlychip-related earnings last week proved to be strongerthan expected, kicking off with an upbeat note on an otherwise tenuous earnings season that had been prefaced by a number of warnings.</p><p>Chipmaking-equipment manufacturer KLA Corp. KLAC reports earnings after the bell Wednesday, and then Intel Corp. INTC reports Thursday after the close. Another large supplier to the auto industry, NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, is scheduled to report earnings Oct. 31.</p><p>Texas Instruments stock lags as it appears auto sales are now sole driver of analog chip segment</p>",
