  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 650 points, or 2.2%, to 29,273, near the session low of 29,238.49.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX dropped 104 points, or 2.8%, to 3,639.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 410 points, or 3.7%, to 10,663.</p><p>Stocks were on track for back-to-back losses, trimming weekly gains, but still on pace for their best weekly gains in about a month, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Read: Will the stock market be open on Columbus Day?</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks slumped after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate declined to 3.5% from an August reading of 3.7%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3%.</p><p>\"It's a reflection that people have re-entered the mindset that the Fed is going to be raising rates at a rapid clip, probably for longer than what they might have suspected at the start of the week,\" said Robert Pavlik, a senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, by phone.</p><p>Pavlik expects the Fed to keep tightening financial conditions to try to head off inflation. \"But once we turn the corner, and the economy slows down, the Fed probably will be more aggressive in cutting rates on the way down.\"</p><p>The data underlined the labor market's role in the inflation battle, said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, in a note.</p><p>\"If unemployment remains low, employers will increase wages to attract talent, creating more disposable income. Increased purchasing power will then lead to increased demand for goods and services, spiking prices and potentially causing the Fed to raise rates even more.\"</p><p>In addition, the Fed has been \"draining liquidity from the system at a remarkable pace,\" wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, in a Friday client note, while pointing to an astounding $1.3 trillion decline in the central bank's balance sheet since the December 2021 peak.</p><p>Pavlik at Dakota Wealth said he anticipates the Fed will start slowing interest rate hikes by mid-next year, which likely means continued pressure for the stock market, particularly with a backdrop of big oil-price CL00 gains this week after global crude producers voted to cut monthly production and with the U.S. dollar's DXY surge this year against a basket of rival currencies.</p><p>The energy component of the S&amp;P 500 was one of a few corners of the stock-market in the green on Friday, bolstered by U.S. crude oil prices that climbed to about $92 a barrel. In exchange-traded funds, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE also was up 0.8%.</p><p>New York Fed President John Williams said Friday that benchmark interest rates likely need to hit 4.5% over time. The Fed's policy rate nowsits in a 3%-3.25% range, but up from a zero-0.25% range a year ago.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was near 3.88% Friday, a key metric used to gauge the affordability of credit for businesses, household and the economy.</p><p>Read: Bond markets facing historic losses grow anxious of Fed that 'isn't blinking yet'</p><p>Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller late on Thursday said he didn't expect the jobs report to change anyone's thinking at the central bank.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Twitter Inc. TWTR shares were again in focus Friday after a judge delayed a looming trial between the company and Elon Musk to allow the Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO more time to close his $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform.</p><p>* Besides the jobs report, investors weighed a profit warning from microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, which said the PC market weakened significantly during the quarter. AMD shares fell 12.9%, and rivals including Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Intel Corp. INTC were also lower.</p><p>* U.S. cannabis stocks fell Friday, with the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF MSOS down 5.4%, following steep gains earlier in the week after President Joe Biden said the U.S. would consider de-scheduling cannabis from its current position as a Schedule 1 narcotic under federal law.</p><p>â€”Steven Goldstein contributed reporting to this article</p><p>Dow tumbles 650 points after strong jobs report, but stocks still on pace to snap 3-week losing streak</p>",
