A trough is likely to come only when unemployment rates are close to peaking, which could be a year or so from now, \" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management.</p><p>\"Broad diversification, active tactical asset allocation and disciplined downside risk management will be key to navigate the bumpy road ahead,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, equity investors appear to have decided that the latest Federal Reserve minutes, released on Wednesday, contained little to be concerned about.</p><p>Attention will now turn to a speech on Thursday from St Louis Fed president James Bullard, and Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for fresh clues to the Fed's policy trajectory. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 5 basis points at 2.967%.</p><p>In Europe, Germany's Dax 40 DX:DAX recovered some more ground, adding 1.6%, and the FTSE 100 UK:UKXin London climbed 1.2 per cent after UK media said prime minister Boris Johnson would resign.</p><p>In Asia, the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP rose 0.3% despite lingering concerns about Beijing's zero-COVID 19 policy.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>Crude oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate CL.1 , easing 0.4% to $98.15 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark lost nearly $10 over the previous two sessions amid worries about slowing global demand. WTI surged to more than $130 a barrel in early March after Russia invaded Ukraine, as traders feared sanctions on Moscow would crimp supply.</p><p>The dollar index DXY was down 0.2% to 106.85. The DXY on Wednesday breached 107, its highest level in 19 years as worries about the European economy and political turmoil in the U.K. pressured the euro and sterling.</p><p>Gold GC00 rose 0.4% to $1,743 an ounce and silver added 0.5% to $19.27 an ounce. Both precious metals have been hit of late by the stronger buck, but this has left the grey metal relatively cheap versus its fellow bullion.</p><p>\"The mint ratio, which is the ratio between the two precious metals, is now around 90, whereas you would normally expect it to stay between 50 and 80 by historical averages,\" noted Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced by 0.5% to $20505, but still down nearly 70% from its record high, as traders warily eye recent turmoil in the crypto sector.</p><p>Wall Street eyes fourth day of gains with tech set to lead again</p>",
