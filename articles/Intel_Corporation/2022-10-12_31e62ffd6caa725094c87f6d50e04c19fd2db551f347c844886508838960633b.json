  "text": "<p>A question that's going around is what breaks next as central banks across the globe keep raising interest rates in a bid to get runaway inflation under control. \"The place to look for breaking things are wherever there's leverage, and wherever we have artificial market structure maintained by the authorities,\" said John Ricciardi, head of global asset allocation at Deuterium Capital Management and a long-time industry veteran.</p><p>One place to look: Japan, where the yen USDJPY has declined in value by 27% against the dollar this year while the Bank of Japan keeps rates at zero. \"One thing that could break, and it's something we discussed internally, is the ability of the Japanese to maintain a zero interest rate policy,\" he told MarketWatch in an interview.</p><p>Betting that Japanese interest rates would rise is a classic \"widowmaker\" trade in that it hasn't succeeded in decades, and its unwinding would boost the beleaguered Japanese currency.</p><p>Another place to look is Europe, where the European Central Bank is trying to keep sovereign spreads in the eurozone anchored but periphery CDS, in Greece and Italy, are widening. \"Should this continue, it won't be just the euro — which is kind of helpful that it goes down — but it will be in interest rates and interest rate differentials,\" he said.</p><p>Ricciardi is the lead manager of the Deuterium Global Dynamic Allocation Fund, where investments are primarily dictated by its model of the global economy, with inputs for central bank policy, market valuation and price trends.</p><p>That fund is anticipating a rough fourth quarter both for U.S. stocks and commodities, forecasting consumer spending will finally turn, industrial output will decelerate, and earnings growth expectations to ratchet down. The firm is expecting the fastest fall in U.S. consumption and retail sales since the 2008 financial crisis, as workers react to falling incomes adjusted for inflation.</p><p>\"You see it in the drop in the savings rate, you see it in their maxed-out credit cards,\" says Ricciardi. With mortgage rates surging, refinancing isn't an avenue that consumers can turn, either. \"The big damage is still to come in the equity market for the next month or couple of months,\" he said.</p><p>Ricciardi notes that this year, bonds sold off first, then non U.S. currencies, before stocks starting swooning. He said it'll probably reverse in that order as well, when either the Federal Reserve will pivot or the labor market will turn — but that won't be until next year.</p><p>He referenced the 1985 Plaza Accord, when global central banks got together and took orchestrated action to lower the dollar. \"I don't know if something like that would ever be on the table, but I could certainly see that the moment of a Fed pivot, that the authorities in one way or another would come together to find a way to ease the pressures on global liquidity from the appreciating dollar.\"</p><p>The market</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX has dropped for five straight sessions, and, technically, the Nasdaq Composite COMP entered a bear market on Tuesday. But things are looking up on Wednesday, with stock futures ES00 NQ00 higher, and the dollar DXY slightly weaker. The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 3.95%.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Producer prices rose 0.4% in September, which was more than forecast, to take the year-over-year rate to 8.5%, the Labor Department reported.
