  "text": "<p>King Charles III <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/067a9c1f-ce8f-437f-8816-09f04fbe6466\">is preparing to address the nation</a> for the first time as head of state following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, after seven decades on the throne.</p> <p>The new King will travel from Balmoral, the royal estate in Scotland, to London and is expected to hold an audience with Liz Truss, who became prime minister just three days ago. He will then make a televised address at 6pm.</p> <p>The death of the Queen at 96 — announced by Buckingham Palace yesterday evening — has left the UK in mourning but reflecting on a life of duty in which she bound the country together through momentous change.</p> <p>The official period of mourning will last until seven days after the funeral, Buckingham Palace said today. It did not confirm the date of the funeral. </p> <p>Parliament will gather at noon today for a 10-hour session for MPs to pay their respects to the Queen while bells will toll at St Paul's Cathedral, Windsor Castle and Westminster Abbey.</p> <p>A ceremonial bell at Windsor Castle will toll 96 times, once for each year of the Queen's life — and a 96-gun salute will be fired in Hyde Park.</p> <p>Crowds gathered outside the Queen's residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, leaving flowers and tributes. World leaders paid their respects to the longest serving monarch in British history. </p> <p>In America, there was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5bacc8b-ca4d-484c-93f1-e082d628597f\">a rare outbreak of bipartisanship in Washington</a> and an unusual hush on Wall Street when the news of Queen Elizabeth II's death was announced.</p> <p>King Charles III's formal accession to the throne and proclamation as monarch will take place tomorrow, when parliament will sit for senior MPs to swear an oath of allegiance.</p> <p>The new King said that the death of his mother was a moment of “the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family”.</p> <p><em>Our live blog will keep you up to date with </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24929fff-4aad-446d-ac26-64af89e86478\"><em>the latest developments</em></a><em> as they are announced.</em></p> <h2>Read and watch more: </h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Obituary:</strong> The Queen became <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c9df38-7b92-4a81-9cd6-1f93dfc749ea\">a symbol of continuity and unity</a> in an ever-changing political landscape.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>King Charles III</strong> The Queen's eldest son, 73, has become the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2782c51-ad2b-4256-bf79-1ef6eae0f00b\">oldest monarch to accede to the throne</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Inside Politics:</strong> The Queen was a canny political operator, writes Stephen Bush in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fb11fc2-7884-40af-a6e9-e68382f07c3f\">his appreciation</a> of her majesty.</p></li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/a3d56d6d-db7a-4963-8cf5-ca434c54fd27.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><em>What did Queen Elizabeth II mean to you?
