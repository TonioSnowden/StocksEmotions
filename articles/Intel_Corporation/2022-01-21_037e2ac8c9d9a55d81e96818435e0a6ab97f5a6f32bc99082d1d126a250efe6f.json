  "text": "<p>* Netflix plunged 19% premarket. The streaming giant said it expects to add a much smaller number of subscribers this quarter than it did a year ago as it adjusts to growing competition and lasting disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. The bad news seemed to rub off on streaming-device maker Roku, which shed 4.9% premarket.</p><p>* Peloton powered 6.4% higher premarket, but that only makes up a bit of Thursday's 24% drop. The company is reviewing the size of its workforce and resetting production levels as it adapts to more seasonal demand for its exercise equipment.</p><p>* Intel nudged down 0.1%. The company plans to invest at least $20 billion in new chip-making capacity in Ohio.</p><p>* CSX fell 1.4%, though the railroad operator is projecting that shipping volume will rise faster than GDP this year and reported a slight earnings beat.</p><p>* Ally Financial shares slipped 3% premarket after it reported lower earnings per share during the recent quarter from a year prior.</p><p>* Huntington Bancshares ticked down 1.1% after it also reported an earnings drop.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Europe's tech scene has struggled to emerge from the shadows of giants in the U.S. and Asia, but friendly local policies and a global overflow of investment capital are now giving the region a gusher of cash.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Bitcoin, Netflix, Peloton, Coinbase: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
