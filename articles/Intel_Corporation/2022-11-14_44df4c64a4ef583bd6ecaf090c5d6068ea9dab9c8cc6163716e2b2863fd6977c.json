  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 163 points, or 0.5%, at 33,912.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX advanced 10 points, or 0.3%, to 4,003.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite fell 5 points, or less than 0.3%, to 11,319.</p><p>Stocks rose sharply late last week, with the Nasdaq Composite advancing 9.4% in two days to cement its biggest weekly advance since at least March, while the S&amp;P 500 clinched its best such performance since June.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Dow industrials were higher Monday afternoon on a choppy day for markets as investors waited to see if last week's rally, inspired by softer-than-anticipated October inflation data, might still have some more room to run.</p><p>Signs of cooling inflation in Thursday's consumer prices data bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may not need to continue raising borrowing costs at such an aggressive pace. The Fed's No. 2 official, Lael Brainard, seemed to confirm as much, by telling Bloomberg in an interview that it may be appropriate soon for policy makers to slow down their current pace of rate hikes.</p><p>\"We have to take a look at what the market has done over the last couple of weeks,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA Corp. \"Equities have clearly stabilized and it's all because of expectations that the Fed is about to end its tightening cycle after February.\"</p><p>\"Now we are at a weird stage where investors need to see inflation soften, which means you are not going to see strong positioning until we get the next inflation report,\" Moya said via phone. \"That's going to make it a choppy environment for stocks until there's further clarity if the Fed is done with raising rates or will have to continue. Officials need to see labor-market weakness and we are finally getting signs of that, too.\"</p><p>Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank DB, and others point out in a note to clients that the inflation report wasn't the only factor that helped set up stocks and other risk-sensitive assets for a rebound.</p><p>\"Impressive levels of European gas storage due to the weather, very short positioning in US equities, mid-terms being out the way, positive seasonals, less event risk in the Russian/Ukraine war, and now softer U.S. inflation than expected are all helping,\" Reid said.</p><p>Also helping the rebound was a rally in some of the worst-hit technology stocks as investors welcomed signs that they may be reining in their profligate spending. Meta Platforms META, for example, was up 1.9% as it cuts its staff count.</p><p>Looking ahead, technical strategists see the next key resistance level for the S&amp;P 500 at 4,100.</p><p>\"The market gapped up cleanly and ferociously through that 3900 level. Now its next test is looming: the 200-day moving average and that downtrend line tracing the previous sequence of highs,\" said Callum Thomas at ChartStorm.</p><p>\"We know the narrative [cooler CPI] that helped it breakout, [it] makes me wonder what story we might tell once its reaches resistance…markets have a habit of finding excuses to do what they are technically ready to do!\" Thomas added.</p><p>Government bond markets resumed trading on Monday, after being closed Friday for the Veterans Day holiday, with the yield on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up 6 basis points at 3.88%.</p><p>Over the weekend, Fed Gov. Christopher Waller said financial markets seem to have overreacted to the softer-than-expected October consumer price inflation data last week, and that \"we've got a ways to go.\"</p><p>\"The burst of euphoria which erupted over U.S. markets and spread more widely at the end of last week is ebbing away after fresh warnings that the fight against inflation is still a hard slog yet to be won,\" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in a note.</p><p>See:Stock-market rally despite FTX blowup, Facebook-parent's layoffs, says investors may be whistling past recession's graveyard</p><p>Single-market movers</p><p>* Semiconductor stocks are rebounding a bit on Monday. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH was up 0.3%. Intel Corp. INTC was up 1%.</p><p>* Moderna Inc. announced both of its new Covid-19 boostersproduced a better antibody response against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants in a Phase 2/3 clinical than the company's original booster. Moderna shares MRNA rose 6.8%.</p><p>* Chinese tech names were up sharply on more news about Covid-19 restrictions waning. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB was up 2.1%, while shares of Baidu Inc. BIDU and JD.com JD were also up, among other Chinese megacap tech names like Alibaba BABA.</p><p>* Amazon.com Inc. stock AMZN slipped 1.6% after the New York Times reported that the company intends to lay offabout 10,000 corporate and technology workers as economic conditions continue to hit Big Tech.</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow climbs, S&amp;P 500 reclaims 4,000 mark as investors evaluate peak-inflation narrative</p>",
