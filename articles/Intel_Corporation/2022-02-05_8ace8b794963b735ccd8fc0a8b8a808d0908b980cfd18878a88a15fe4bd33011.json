Clifford</p><p>The Impossible City: A Hong Kong Memoir</p><p>By Karen Cheung</p><p>In the Camps</p><p>By Darren Byler</p><p>The opening of the Winter Olympics puts \"sportswashing\" on global display. The Chinese government has devoted vast resources to the Games, hoping that they will convey an open and appeal-ing image of China and distract attention from the country's totalitarian practices at home and threats abroad. Fortunately, new books about China offer a counter-narrative, detailing, among other matters, the attack on Hong Kong's freedoms and the assault on China's Uyghur minority.</p><p>Mark L. Clifford's \"Today Hong Kong, Tomorrow the World\" (St. Martin's, 306 pages, $29.99) captures how much has been wrested from Hong Kong's people -- a measure of how far Beijing is willing to go to destroy liberal institutions and democratic norms and ensure its tight lock on the power of the Chinese Communist Party. After Mao took over China, Hong Kong was a prosperous and free harbor for Chinese people, \"a haven, protected by the British rule of law and run by competent and largely hands-off administrators.\" When Britain handed the colony back to China in 1997 -- it was by then one of the world's most dynamic financial capitals -- it did so under the terms of an international treaty whose commitments Beijing has brazenly violated, especially in the past two years. Instead of respecting Hong Kong's autonomy, China has eliminated its freedoms, jailing leading pro-democracy politicians and journalists.</p><p>\"This tiny former British colony,\" Mr. Clifford writes, \"is a testing ground for attempts to limit the freedoms of open societies.\" What Beijing did to Hong Kong it could try anywhere, if unchecked. \"The Communist destruction of the territory's liberties marks the only time in contemporary history when a totalitarian government has destroyed a free society.\" The most recent crackdowns, Mr. Clifford notes, have \"shuttered a free press and ended free speech and freedom of assembly, and curtailed the right to be presumed innocent, the right to a jury trial, and the right to hold private property without the government arbitrarily seizing it.\"</p><p>A journalist and business executive in Hong Kong for nearly 30 years, Mr. Clifford became a human-rights activist after his experience on the board of directors of Next Digital, the publicly traded company that published Apple Daily, Hong Kong's leading pro-democracy news outlet. (Full disclosure: I served on Next Digital's board at the same time.) With no court order or court conviction, Apple Daily was driven out of business last year under the all-powerful National Security Law -- imposed in 2020 on Hong Kong and applying globally -- that treats dissent and other forms of free expression as subversion and collusion with foreign forces. Apple Daily's founder, Jimmy Lai, has been jailed since 2020. Mr. Lai's top journalist colleagues -- the \"Apple Daily 7\" -- are also denied bail and jailed.</p><p>When Apple Daily was under siege, Mr. Clifford witnessed the impact of the government's extralegal actions. He is haunted, he writes, by \"the memory of IT staff fleeing the building as the newspaper's last issue was being prepared, spooked by rumors that the police were coming again. Of staff members begging us to assure their safety after the building was raided (these workers are now in jail). Of an executive in tears, confessing he's been so broken by events that he considered suicide.\" Mr. Clifford aptly concludes by wondering whether \"Hong Kong can be both a global financial center and a city that holds political prisoners.\"</p><p>One mystery is why so many Hong Kong residents now in their 20s, who might otherwise have been indifferent or intimidated, took to the streets to protest the Chinese government's policies. The empty promises of greater self-rule and 50 years of \"one-country, two systems\" radicalized an entire generation, Karen Cheung asserts in \"The Impossible City: A Hong Kong Memoir\" (Random House, 319 pages, $28.99). Ms. Cheung -- who was a baby when her family moved to Hong Kong from the mainland and 4 years old when her adopted city returned to China -- describes her difficult upbringing, her studies at school and university, and her early assumption that she and her peers would have until 2047 -- the year when the treaty-dictated terms of Hong Kong's autonomy officially expire -- \"to construct our identity, not British anymore, and not quite China yet.\" But when the Chinese Communist Party insisted on \"patriotic\" education and forced extradition to the mainland for political offenses, \"it became clear that the promise of democracy would never materialize, that it was likely never intended to be kept.\"</p><p>Student-led protests included up to two million people, about a quarter of Hong Kong's residents -- the equivalent of 80 million Americans marching on Washington. The authorities responded with tear gas and bullets. Freewheeling Hong Kong is dead, Ms. Cheung writes: \"I don't know where to find the language to describe the grief I feel when I walk through the city and see phantoms of riot police spilling from the escalators of the malls and street corners, the gray smear of the crudely covered-up protest graffiti in the underpasses and tunnels, or the torn down 'democracy wall' at my alma mater.\"</p><p>Darren Byler is an scholar who, for a decade, has studied the Muslim Uyghur community and Beijing's use of the world's most advanced digital surveillance in Xinjiang, the western region where China's Uyghurs are native. He says that he personally knows 40 Uyghurs who have disappeared into the government camps there; they are among the 10%-20% of adult Uyghurs now detained by the Chinese government.</p><p>Among the persecuted figures whom Mr. Byler profiles in \"In the Camps\" (Columbia Global Reports, 159 pages, $15.99) is Vera Zhou, a Chinese-born member of the Hui Muslim group who went to high school near Portland, Ore., and who was a college junior when she was arrested in 2017 while visiting China -- the pretext was that she had used a virtual private network, or VPN, to access her University of Washington student email. For this she was sent to a prison described by her guards as a \"centralized controlled education training center.\" Muslims like Ms. Zhou are jailed for violating any of 75 cyber \"pre-crime\" offenses, including using a VPN to access the internet or installing the WhatsApp platform on their phone. These acts are declared to be signs of \"religious extremism.\" The Chinese government, Mr. Byler observes, can now apply the surveillance and biodata technology it has perfected in Xinjiang -- the work of \"the algorithm tinkerers, the face recognition designers, the DNA mappers\" -- anywhere it wishes.</p><p>Indeed, Hong Kong and Xinjiang are canaries in the mineshaft. As Mr. Clifford says in his own book: The Chinese Communist Party's \"pathological intolerance of dissent and the government-backed campaigns of intimidation, blacklisting, and violence are part of a totalitarian pattern,\" and this pattern is increasingly evident outside the country. China recently punished Australia for demanding an independent study of the origins of Covid-19 and Lithuania for opening a Taiwanese representative office. China has also forced businesses to kowtow to its demands, as we have seen in its dealings with Intel, HSBC bank, and the National Basketball Association.</p><p>To this list of collaborators, now add the International Olympic Committee and its corporate sponsors for failing to protect the world's athletes. Chinese authorities have warned Olympians that they are \"subject to certain punishment\" if they dare criticize China while in the country.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Crovitz, co-CEO of NewsGuard, is a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
