  "text": "<p>Samsung Electronics has flagged its first profit fall in nearly three years in a sign of the deepening industry downturn as demand for electronic devices fades.</p> <p>The world's largest memory chipmaker and smartphone producer on Friday estimated its operating profit for the three months to the end of September at Won10.8tn ($7.7bn), down 32 per cent from a year earlier.</p> <p>It was much lower than the Bloomberg estimate of Won12.1tn and marked the first decline in profits since 2020. Sales came in at Won76tn, up 3 per cent year on year. &#xa0;</p> <p>The weaker-than-expected profit guidance comes after US chipmaker Micron Technologies and Japan's Kioxia Holdings cut spending to counter a supply glut. Advanced Micro Devices, a US chipmaker, on Thursday cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by about $1.1bn from its August forecast. </p> <p>“The pace of falling demand for smartphones, PC and TVs is very fast because of the macroeconomic headwinds. And the pace of cutting chip orders is faster because of high inventories,” said Choi Do-yeon, an analyst at Shinhan Securities.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/18fac44d-7b87-4341-ab9b-b0cd8ccf498f\">Samsung</a> is not considering a memory chip production cut yet, an executive told reporters in the US earlier this week.</p> <p>The company's semiconductor business head Kyung Kye-hyun expects the memory market to remain sluggish until the end of next year. He recently told employees at an internal event that Samsung slashed its second-half chip sales guidance by 32 per cent from its April forecast, according to the Korea Economic Daily.</p> <p>The gloomy outlook has pushed Samsung shares about 30 per cent lower so far this year. But Morgan Stanley this week upgraded the semiconductor sector, driving up shares of Samsung and SK Hynix on expectations of a market rebound in the second half of next year.</p> <p>“The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/semiconductors\">semiconductor industry</a> has been rattled by the sudden inventory adjustment of customers amid growing anxiety over the economic outlook,” said Park Yuak, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. “Chip prices in the second half would be much lower than expected although the inventory adjustment is likely to be over by the first quarter of next year.” &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Geopolitical risks are another area of concern for chipmakers. Washington is expected to announce new restrictions against memory chipmakers in China on Friday in a bid to curb Beijing's technological advances.</p> <p>However, the move could impact the Chinese operations of South Korean companies, analysts said.</p> <p>Samsung has a Nand flash memory chip factory in the city of Xi'an while SK Hynix runs a Dram chip plant in Wuxi and a Nand plant in Dalian that it bought from Intel two years ago. </p> <p>The South Korean companies have recently announced a series of deals to build new factories in the US as part of President Joe Biden's Chips and Science Act.</p><p>Source: Song Jung-a in Seoul  2022 'Samsung hit by first profit fall in three years as global chip demand slows' FT.com 7 October.
