In response, AstraZeneca accelerated its analysis, which involved examining each additional case to see whether it was really Covid-19.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US trial rebuke was the latest controversy facing the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has also been locked in a bitter battle with the EU over accusations it had&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27221e59-e4ee-4c0a-b07a-a668a59978c6\">failed to meet supply targets</a>. </p> <p>Italy on Wednesday said it had&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48b28b7e-9161-47a4-9c37-cf89fea2bc12\">discovered a stockpile</a>&#xa0;of 29m AstraZeneca vaccine doses in a facility in the country, prompting the EU to say the group is “not even close” to delivering the 30m doses of the vaccine it promised the bloc.
