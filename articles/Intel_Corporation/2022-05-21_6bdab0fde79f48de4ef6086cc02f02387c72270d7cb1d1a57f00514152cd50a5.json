  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Who Won the  U.S.-China Trade War? -2-",
  "text": "<p>   Weighing whether China or the U.S. came out ahead in the trade war is an exercise in counting gains and losses. But some countries had nothing but wins; they started exporting to the U.S. goods that China once sold. \"Any time we impose tariffs on a single country, countries that can provide substitutes will ramp up,\" explains Dartmouth economic historian Douglas Irwin. </p><p>   Who won the U.S.-China trade war? In many respects, it's been Vietnam. </p><p>   According to calculations by Kearney, China shipped $50 billion less in manufactured goods to the U.S. in 2021 than it did in 2018, as tariffs increased the cost of Chinese imports. During that same time, Vietnam -- free from those U.S. tariffs -- increased its factory goods shipments to the U.S. by $50 billion. Looked at from another angle, exports of manufactured goods from 14 low-cost Asian nations, including China, tracked by Kearney, increased by $90 billion in 2021 compared with 2018. Vietnam accounted for about half that increase. </p><p>   Vietnam had become a manufacturing hub well before the trade war. Following the path pioneered by other export-heavy Asian countries, Vietnam welcomed foreign investment, improved its infrastructure and benefited from being close geographically to China and paying cheaper wages. </p><p>   Vietnam's early export successes were in labor-intensive industries like apparel and furniture, but it has now become a center for electronics manufacturing too, with big investments by Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. The U.S.-China trade war accelerated that change, say economists. </p><p>   \"Vietnam positioned itself well to take advantage of the crises that occurred,\" says Trinh Nguyen, a Natixis economist in Hong Kong. The trade war was one such crisis. </p><p>   Alex Shuford, the CEO of RHF Investments Inc., a furniture maker in Hickory, N.C., shifted his orders for leather couches to Vietnam from China after the tariffs made Chinese imports too expensive. During a recent scouting trip to Asia, he didn't bother to stop in China because prices there were still too high, and the country was going through another set of Covid lockdowns. \"Some years ago, we would have started in China,\" he says. </p><p>   Additional export revenue helped Vietnam to build up its industrial parks, ports and roads and attract higher-paying industries like electronics. According to Moody's Analytics, a market data firm, 46% of Vietnam's exports to the U.S. now consist of electrical machinery, three times the percentage as before the trade war. Lower-value textile and apparel shipments also increased but at a much slower rate. </p><p>   Over this period, America's trade deficit with Vietnam also exploded nearly threefold to $90 billion. During the Trump administration, that gap attracted the attention of Mr. Lighthizer, who launched two investigations into Vietnamese trade practices that could have resulted in tariffs. </p><p>   But the Biden administration, which sees Vietnam as a potential ally in its competition with China, ended both those probes. It now seeks Hanoi's participation in a pan-Asian trade effort it is launching: a win for Vietnam and a win for the U.S. </p><p>   Still, the changes have hardly left China out in the cold. Chinese manufacturers also rushed to set up operations in Vietnam. More than half the fresh exports from Vietnam to the U.S. during the trade war originated from Chinese-owned factories, estimates Patrick Van den Bossche, a Kearney partner. Since 2017, Chinese investment in Vietnam more than doubled to $1.9 billion in 2020. </p><p>   Luxshare Precision Industry Co., a supplier of components to Apple Inc. and other American companies, was one of many Chinese firms to cite U.S. tariffs as a reason to expand in Vietnam. In 2019, Luxshare announced it would build four factories in Vietnam. So far it has invested more than $3 billion there and plans to eventually shift one-third of its production to Vietnam. </p><p>   The trend worries officials in Luxshare's home base of Shenzhen, in southern China, which counts on high-technology firms for a big chunk of its tax revenues. \"Relocation of production capacity is a big issue for us,\" said a Shenzhen official. </p><p>   In yet another wrinkle in the trade war, Shenzhen is now focusing even more on domestic technology development to free itself from dependence on American suppliers. It is offering preferential tax, funding and other policies for entrepreneurs, along with generous grants to universities and other institutions to encourage them to team up with companies and pursue leading-edge technology -- the kinds of subsidies the U.S. had set out to dismantle. </p><p>   Mr. Chor, the Dartmouth economist who studied satellite images of China's nighttime sky for clues about the impact of the trade war, says that the debate over who won and who lost will continue. \"We'll be talking about this in 25 years' time and 50 years' time,\" he says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Wei is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal and Mr. Davis is a former Journal reporter.
