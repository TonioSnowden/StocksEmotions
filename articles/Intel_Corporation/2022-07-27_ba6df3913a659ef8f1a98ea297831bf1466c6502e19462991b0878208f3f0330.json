  "title": "Senate Approves $280 Billion Bill to Boost U.S. Chip Making, Technology; Bipartisan backers say measure is needed to counter China, while GOP foes say embrace of industrial policy amounts to corporate welfare",
  "text": "<p>The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 would spend $52.7 billion on direct financial assistance for the construction and expansion of semiconductor manufacturing facilities, as well as other programs. It adds $24 billion in tax incentives and other provisions.</p><p>It would also turbocharge federal spending on scientific research, reflecting concerns that without more investment the U.S. might struggle to maintain a technological edge.</p><p>\"It will mean more resilient American supply chains, so we are never so reliant on foreign countries for the critical technologies that we need,\" President Biden, a strong supporter of the bill, said in a statement.</p><p>The bill was approved 64-33, with 17 Republicans joining a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor. The House is set to vote Thursday, with passage also expected.</p><p>Opponents of the bill pushed to attach more strings to the funding and questioned the wisdom of a large subsidy to a profitable industry. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) called the package \"one of the grossest gifts to corporate America I've ever seen.\"</p><p>By favoring a particular industry—in this case semiconductor manufacturing—the U.S. is practicing the kind of so-called industrial policy it has long avoided. But supporters say the change is needed for the U.S. to stay competitive.</p><p>\"In the 1970s and '80s our companies could do just fine on their own,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in an interview this week. \"But in the 21st century, with countries like China and Germany investing heavily, we could sit back on the sidelines and who would lose out? American workers, American economic dominance and our national security.\"</p><p>The bill has been in the works for more than three years. Mr. Schumer said he first started discussing it in 2019 with Sen. Todd Young (R., Ind.) when the two were exercising in the Senate gym.</p><p>Companies that could tap the funding for U.S. expansions include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., GlobalFoundries Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Applied Materials Inc. and more.</p><p>A broad swath of business leaders applauded Wednesday's vote. The bill allocates $39 billion for semiconductor manufacturing, but also includes $11 billion to advance semiconductor manufacturing research and workforce training, and a $2 billion fund to more quickly translate laboratory advances into military and other applications.</p><p>\"Companies that make semiconductors and companies that use semiconductors represent almost the entirety of the corporate ecosystem in America,\" said Jason Oxman, president of the trade group Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Intel, as well as manufacturers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. Vice Chairman Gary Cohn had called for the legislation's approval on a call with reporters earlier in the week. \"We need to protect ourselves first as a country and make sure that we're in the chip manufacturing business,\" he said.</p><p>The Senate passed a version of its bill last year, but movement stalled until February when the House passed its version. The lower chamber added billions of dollars to combat climate change, as well as provisions on immigration and marijuana. Talks then stalled again, with lawmakers hung up for months on which provisions to jettison and which to include.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans, stressing the national-security worries of reliance on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Most of the chips aren't made in the U.S.</p><p>Senior Pentagon officials gave briefings on Capitol Hill about national-security concerns. White House officials coordinated the efforts of dozens of industry associations, holding sometimes weekly meetings.</p><p>Pressure on lawmakers ramped up in June when manufacturers like Intel and GlobalWafers, a Taiwan-based semiconductor silicon-wafer firm that had announced plans to build in Sherman, Texas, along with others, began saying their U.S. expansion plans hinged on passage.</p><p>At an early June meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room, congressional and administration staffers concluded it was time to narrow the bill's scope, said a White House official who attended.</p><p>Lawmakers stripped the bill of components they disagreed on, resulting in the skinnier Chips Act that dropped much of the House portion unrelated to semiconductors, but kept the research elements that lawmakers say will make the U.S. competitive long term.</p><p>During this week's Senate debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) accused Intel Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger of extorting lawmakers, pointing to the executive's assertion that his and other companies would likely invest in manufacturing facilities in Europe or Asia if the bill doesn't pass this summer.</p><p>\"I worry not only about this bill. I worry about the precedent,\" said Mr. Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. \"Any company who is prepared to go abroad, who has ignored the needs of the American people, will then say to the Congress, 'Hey, if you want us to stay here, you better give us a handout.'\"</p><p>Intel praised the Senate vote in a statement Wednesday. Mr. Gelsinger, in a recent op-ed he co-wrote with Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley published in The Wall Street Journal, said the legislation is necessary for the U.S. to \"help level the playing field with global competitors.\"</p><p>\"Without intervention, shortages of chips—including the legacy chips widely used in the auto, medical-device and defense industries—are expected to persist as investment in the U.S. stalls,\" Messrs. Gelsinger and Farley wrote.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) joined Mr. Sanders in blaming the U.S.'s brittle semiconductor supply chain on the industry's earlier decisions to move operations offshore. But Mr. Brown said he supports the bill because it promises jobs in his home state, where Intel is planning a chip-manufacturing facility. \"We're on the verge of a big win for Ohio,\" he said.</p><p>In January, Intel announced plans to build a plant in Ohio, dependent on the legislation passing.</p><p>If the bill is approved in the House, as expected, it will give Democrats an accomplishment to talk about in a year when much of Mr. Biden's agenda is stalled, though it could be years before new chip fabrication plants are built.</p><p>Sen. Raphael Warnock (D., Ga.), who is up for re-election, singled out a KIA Corp. auto factory in West Point, Ga., which has been forced to shut down operations multiple times due to the chip shortage. He said the bill will \"help lower costs, create Georgia jobs and ensure Georgia workers are ready to compete in a changing economy.\"</p><p>Many lawmakers also see hometown benefits in the bill's second component, which authorizes nearly $170 billion for technology research and development across several federal agencies during the next five years.</p><p>Chunks of that funding are expected to flow to rural states under new formulas for distributing research dollars. The legislation also directs the Commerce Department to create 20 \"regional technology hubs\" designed to create more tech jobs across the country.</p><p>The technology R&amp;D investments target fields including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, wireless communications and precision agriculture.</p><p>The National Science Foundation would oversee a new $20 billion directorate focused on accelerating the development of technologies critical to U.S. security, in addition to an increase to $61 billion for its core activities funding researchers at universities and elsewhere.</p><p>The Energy Department's Office of Science's five-year authorization would increase to about $50 billion to boost a series of programs focused on clean energy, nuclear physics and high-intensity lasers.</p><p>The bill also sets new long-term policies for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, instructing the space agency to prioritize the research required to bring Americans to Mars, as well as programs such as Artemis Moon, which could put the first woman and person of color on the moon.</p><p>Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Approves $280 Billion Bill to Boost U.S. Chip Making, Technology</p>",
