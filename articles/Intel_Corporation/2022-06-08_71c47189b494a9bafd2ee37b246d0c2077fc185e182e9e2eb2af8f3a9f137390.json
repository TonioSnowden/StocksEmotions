  "title": "Cybersecurity (A Special Report) --- How Congress Can Help Make Cyberattacks Less Likely: Rep. Yvette Clarke talks about the importance of regulators and companies working together",
  "text": "<p>REP. CLARKE: The idea is working with the private sector, identifying key stakeholders in this space, we would create a safe space at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency where the agency and the companies would work together in real time as they address these incidents.</p><p>WSJ: The FBI and Justice Department have both said they oppose this law because, in their view, it could damage their ability to conduct investigations. How do you respond to those concerns?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: We don't necessarily agree on language, but that doesn't mean that we can't address conflicts if they arise.</p><p>WSJ: Other agencies have rolled out rules and proposed regulations mandating reporting regimes of their own. Do we need all these independent reporting structures?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: The Biden administration is looking for a whole-of-government approach. However, it's going to be really important that each of our federal agencies see CISA as the lead agency and work very closely with them. CISA has the authorities to really take the lead in this space.</p><p>WSJ: Since you head the subcommittee that provides oversight of CISA, how do you see the agency's future?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: I and my colleagues see CISA growing from strength to strength as we become engaged with critical infrastructure and emerging technologies. They have to build the workforce, they have to build the expertise to manage a growing portfolio of means by which we protect the homeland, infrastructure, the communities we all reside in. CISA will manage a $1 billion grant program that will help municipalities, localities and states stand up a more robust cybersecurity posture and infrastructure.</p><p>WSJ: What's on your legislative wish list?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: We've got a pretty robust foundation. However, there are other spaces in which we have to have eyes and situational awareness, whether that is industrial control or operational technology, quantum computing, emerging technologies in that space, or election systems and disinformation. We intend to have a number of hearings to really drill down and get more intel on how we can provide CISA with the authorities it needs to address all of those areas that remain vulnerable.</p><p>AUDIENCE QUESTION: What do you think about sharing intelligence gathered from disclosures back to the private sector after removing identifying attributes to help the private sector defend itself better?</p><p>REP. CLARKE: CISA will be a great repository of best practices, of case studies. It's important that it's a two-way street, that we're able to get information about incidents and disseminate it to the various sectors so that they can defend the private sectors where most of our infrastructure and our IT is located. Without their knowledge and cooperation and collaboration, there's a gap. And that's where the bad actors will flourish.</p>",
