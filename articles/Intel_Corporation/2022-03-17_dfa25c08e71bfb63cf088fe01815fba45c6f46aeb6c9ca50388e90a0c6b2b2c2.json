  "title": "Is TikTok Helping or Hurting Our Skin? Skin-care influencers on the freewheeling social-media platform have unleashed a slew of trendy beauty routines. But do these treatments have any real benefit, or can some actually be harmful?",
  "text": "<p>In an episode this season of Euphoria, the HBO drama about high schoolers, popular-girl Cassie gets up at 4 a.m. to begin a long, manic beauty routine before school. \"She loved the ritual, the attention to detail,\" the narrator intones, as Cassie volleys among different tools and gadgets—under-eye gel masks, a vibrating sculpting bar, an ice roller, a face roller and others—in an increasingly frenzied state. Followers of TikTok skin-care content, or \"skinTok,\" might recognize certain products. Sydney Sweeney, the 24-year-old actor who plays Cassie, is a skinTok fan, and she developed much of Cassie's routine herself. Most of the tools Cassie uses in the scene are Sweeney's own.</p><p>On TikTok, videos hashtagged #skincare have more than 80 billion views. The offerings range from a guide to color-correcting mineral sunscreen for darker complexions (@dermbeautydoc) to a discussion of myths about controversial ingredients like petrolatum (@charlotteparler) to a how-to for using candy canes and conversation hearts to make face masks (@skincareryan). You'll find a dermatologist's reactions to pimple-popping videos (@dermdoctor) and experimental facials using ingredients like bologna slices, toilet paper and pumpkin pie for comedic effect (@yayayayoung).</p><p>Vi Lai (@whatsonvisface) entertains her nearly 1 million TikTok followers with sarcastic takedowns of hyped products and candid, humor-laced advice. In one video, about starting a skin-care routine when you're depressed and lazy, she recommends keeping your sunscreen by your bed; in another about tools, she says of jade rollers: \"[They're] only fun when you're high.\"</p><p>Hawaii-based Hyram Yarbro (@hyram), who has nearly 6.5 million followers, went from influencer to founder last year when he created his own skin-care line called Selfless. Part of his success may be that his posts hit what Evy Lyons, chief marketing officer of Traackr, an influencer marketing platform, considers the hallmarks of the most clickable content: creativity, emotion and education. But over-the-top content (see the aforementioned bologna facial) seems to do well too. \"Unfortunately, shock value sells really well on TikTok, so unsurprisingly there will be brands or creators who will take advantage of the algorithm to gain views,\" says Lai.</p><p>For content creators whose goal is to go viral there's an incentive to be wacky. \"There is no nuance on TikTok: Everything is presented in this intensely simplistic way…so it's either the best or it's horrible,\" says Ranella Hirsch, a Cambridge, Massachusetts dermatologist. \"Anyone can declare themselves an expert; you can say whatever you want, and your voice carries the same 30-second video as somebody who might hold a doctorate on the subject.\"</p><p>On TikTok it's hard to discern who has real credentials. That said, the platform has a number of licensed practitioners, a company spokesperson points out, like @dermdoctor, @208skindoc, @skinbydrazi and @dralexisstephens, who are educating about best practices and myth busting.</p><p>Skin-care hacks are viral gold. Some of them are benign, even redundant. For example, \"reverse skin care,\" which involves applying toner on top of moisturizer for a glowy effect, isn't doing much besides putting product on well-moisturized skin, says Hirsch. The same goes for the polyglutamic acid-and-foundation mash-up, which simply combines a hydrating serum with foundation for skin that looks juicy and plump. Skin icing and facial massage are perfectly lovely, says Hirsch, but they are oversold: They won't slow aging or reverse wrinkling, she says.</p><p>Slugging, or layering an occlusive moisturizer (most popularly Vaseline) over a nighttime serum or lighter-weight moisturizer, to seal it in like a \"gooey version of Saran Wrap,\" says Hirsch, is not new. She notes that Black women have been doing this for generations. One slugging mistake people on TikTok are making is layering over an active ingredient, like a retinoid. The occlusive can greatly increase the potency of the active ingredient, says Hirsch.</p><p>Other hacks are more precarious. Full-potency essential oils, for example, can cause irritation, particularly when not diluted. Sunscreen contouring, or using sunblock as a highlighter and letting the rest of the skin tan for a contoured effect, involves exposing skin to UV radiation. Then there's using personal lubricant as moisturizer. \"Lube, which [can have] stuff like spermicide and chlorhexidine, on your face, under your makeup for 14 hours, [that's] not what it's made for,\" says Hirsch.</p><p>TikTok users relying on buzzwords like toxic and harsh chemicals to prey on people's fears is another phenomenon that's troubling to Boise, Idaho dermatologist Dustin Portela. Otherwise known as @208skindoc, Portela is one of the many skin-care experts who joined TikTok to help debunk the plentiful misinformation going around. While he has plenty of clicky reaction videos, he also offers helpful intel about everything from biopsies to Vitamin C.</p><p>Doctors may cringe at TikTok content, but many brands are benefitting from all the social amplification. Drugstore stalwart CeraVe is one of the most frequently name-checked cleansers; the brand hashtag currently has more than 1.5 billion views. \"TikTok has created some exceptional buzz for CeraVe products,\" says Jaclyn Marrone, VP of marketing for the brand, adding that it's been particularly helpful in expanding awareness to a GenZ audience.</p><p>Nicola Kilner, CEO and co-founder of Deciem, the beauty company that includes affordable skin-care brand The Ordinary, says all the viral support has translated directly to sales: Deciem estimates that The Ordinary's AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution has featured in TikTok videos that have jointly received a total of 92.4 million views, and the solution has sold out at some retailer after viral posts on TikTok. \"More so than ever we hear a consumer's first introduction to a product is through a social influencer,\" says Kilner. And for some products, all it takes is one post: A single video by influencer @jadoregeorgia featuring the Inkey List's Succinic Acid Treatment has reached 7.1 million views. \"The virality of that post yielded a sell-through of four weeks' worth of product in just 10 days,\" says Colette Laxton, co-founder and CEO of the Inkey List.</p><p>Much of TikTok's appeal lies in the fact that it is unapologetically unfiltered, a departure from the polish of Instagram. \"Some of my most well-received TikToks are not skin care related or product driven. They're just videos of me sharing vulnerably about my mental health struggles,\" says Lai. But the skinTok tsunami makes it difficult to heed most dermatologists' main advice, which is to do less and use less. \"There is so much content on this app that you will find stuff to support any murky nonsense that you want,\" says Hirsch.</p><p>Is TikTok Helping or Hurting Our Skin?</p>",
