  "title": "Kioxia Is a Must-Have for Both Western Digital and Micron",
  "text": "<p>Memory-chip makers Micron and Western Digital are weighing bids to buy rival Kioxia, which could value the Japanese company at around $30 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. Kioxia, formerly Toshiba Memory, is the second-largest maker of NAND flash memory, used in storage, according to Trendforce.</p><p>Consolidation in the capital-intensive industry is inevitable. Total capital expenditure for the memory-chip business in 2020 amounted to $39.3 billion, more than a third of the total for the semiconductor industry, according to IC Insights. Spreading that enormous fixed investment over a larger volume helps lower costs. Fewer players in the industry means better pricing power and more disciplined spending.</p><p>Similar consolidation happened in another corner of the memory-chip market. In DRAM, used for processing, three companies -- Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron -- have nearly all of the market.</p><p>Toshiba, which owns 40% of Kioxia, gained 5% Thursday, but SK Hynix went up 6%, probably because a more consolidated market benefits everyone remaining.</p><p>SK Hynix's $9 billion purchase of Intel's NAND flash memory business announced in October kicked off the wave. The combination will transform SK Hynix into the second-largest supplier in the NAND market in 2020 -- the two together had 21% market share in 2020. That has put pressure on smaller players like Western Digital or Micron to pursue deals to expand their scale.</p><p>For Kioxia, the deal offers a price too good to refuse. The Japanese company failed to list its shares in Tokyo in September at a valuation of $16 billion. The company blamed the pandemic and stock-market volatility, but investors probably snubbed the deal because the valuation was seen as too high. Market sentiment has improved since then: Micron and SK Hynix both gained more than 60%. But Kioxia is likely worth much more as part of a rival's empire than it would be if it tried to list again as a stand-alone player.</p><p>Western Digital, which has a joint venture with Kioxia, looks like a natural buyer. But Micron, bigger and more financially sound, could potentially proffer a better bid. Micron's market value is five times that of Western Digital, and it is sitting on net cash and generates higher operating cash flow.</p><p>Assuming some sort of deal goes ahead, whoever fails to buy Kioxia would become the smallest player in the NAND flash industry, pitted against three much bigger players -- a precarious and probably untenable place to be.</p><p>An intense fight for the prize is all but guaranteed.</p>",
