  "title": "Royal Caribbean, Starbucks, Tyson Foods: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Royal Caribbean Group</p><p>Stocks were bolstered this past week by hopes that the new Omicron strain of Covid-19 will have a less-pronounced impact on travel and consumer confidence than first feared. Scientists and vaccine makers are still assessing the severity of Omicron and how well existing vaccines may work against it, but Wall Street traders have increased conviction another major economic shock isn't coming. Cruise lines were among the biggest winners, with Royal Caribbean Group jumping 8.2% Monday, and Carnival Corp. rising 8.1%.</p><p>Intel Corp.</p><p>Intel wants Mobileye to take the wheel. The semiconductor giant said late Monday it is planning to publicly list shares in its Mobileye self-driving-car unit next year, tapping into surging investor demand for companies betting on the future of transportation. The move could value Mobileye at north of $50 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, and Intel would retain a majority stake. Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for around $15 billion, and revenues have roughly tripled since then. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, who is working to revive his company's fortunes, said the offering would give Mobileye a higher profile and ability to attract more business. Intel shares rose 3.1% Tuesday.</p><p>American Airlines Group Inc.</p><p>The chief executive of American Airlines is handing in his wings. The company revealed Tuesday that CEO Doug Parker will step down next year, passing the controls over to Robert Isom. Mr. Parker was a champion of airline consolidation, engineering mergers that transformed the industry and built American into an industry giant. His career was bookended by crises: He took the helm at America West Airlines in 2001, just 10 days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Now he is departing as airlines try to move past the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Isom, who has long been American's heir apparent, has served as the company's president since 2016. Later in the week, the company said it would trim international flights next summer because of Boeing Co.'s delays in delivering new 787 Dreamliners. American shares fell 0.2% Tuesday.</p><p>Pfizer Inc.</p><p>Pfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech SE said a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests, boosting antibodies and providing significantly more protection than two doses do. Still, two doses may prove effective in preventing severe illness, they said Wednesday. The results were issued in a press release by the companies, and weren't peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal. On Thursday, U.S. health regulators cleared the Covid-19 booster from the two companies for use in 16- and 17-year-olds, widening eligibility as the worrisome Omicron variant spreads around the world. Pfizer shares fell 0.6% Wednesday.</p><p>Starbucks Corp.</p><p>Labor unrest is brewing in Buffalo, N.Y. Starbucks baristas there voted to form the first labor union at one of the coffee giant's U.S. cafes in its 50-year history. The workers said they would immediately push the company to bargain with them over pay and other matters. In separate elections at two other stores in the area, one voted against a union and results in the other weren't conclusive Thursday. The National Labor Relations Board said it will review challenges from both sides. Union leaders said they intended to challenge the results of the second store's vote against unionizing, citing ballot irregularities. In September, popular support for unions hit a high last documented in 1965, according to Gallup. Starbucks shares fell 0.8% Thursday.</p><p>Tyson Foods Inc.</p><p>Tyson is letting the robots into the henhouse. The Arkansas-based meat giant said Thursday it plans to spend about $1.3 billion to automate parts of its production lines over the next three years, as meatpackers struggle with a nationwide labor shortage that has left many processing plants understaffed this past year. Tyson, the biggest U.S. chicken producer, said it expects to save about $450 million by the end of its 2024 fiscal year from reduced labor costs and increased production from its automation plans. Covid-19 spread rapidly last year among meat-plant workers, deepening the industry's long-running difficulties keeping plants fully staffed. Over the summer, Tyson, which produces about one-fifth of the country's poultry, said 15% to 20% of plant workers weren't showing up on a typical workday, because of child-care needs and coronavirus-related issues. Tyson shares rose 0.3% Thursday.</p><p>General Motors Co.</p><p>GM is giving a jolt to Michigan's economy. The car maker plans to invest more than $3 billion in two electric-vehicle projects that will be located in its home state, The Wall Street Journal reported, a potential win for Michigan after a recent influx of auto projects into Southern states. One project would convert its Orion Assembly plant in suburban Detroit to serve as its hub for production of electric pickup trucks, potentially creating more than 1,500 jobs at the factory, which today is lightly used, the Journal reported. GM also has plans to build a battery-cell factory near one of its assembly plants in Lansing, Mich., that could create around 1,200 jobs. GM officials are in talks with local governments to secure tax abatements and other approvals for the projects. GM rose 6% Friday.</p><p>Write to Erik Holm at erik.holm@wsj.com</p><p>Royal Caribbean, Starbucks, Tyson Foods: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
