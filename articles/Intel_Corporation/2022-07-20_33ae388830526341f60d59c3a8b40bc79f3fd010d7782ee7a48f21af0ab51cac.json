  "title": "The Senate's Semiconductor Spending Trick; How a $76 billion bill became $250 billion. Hide the children.",
  "text": "<p>The $76 billion Chips version is wasteful enough since the pandemic computer-chip shortage is already easing amid slowing demand and new investments in capacity—including new factories in the U.S.</p><p>But politicians always want more, and the $250 billion version will help the U.S. compete against China only if you believe that the key to success is a larger federal bureaucracy and more political allocation of capital.</p><p>The National Science Foundation will get $81 billion over five years—nearly double its current budget. A Senate Commerce Committee backgrounder says some $20 billion of this will go for a new Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, with the rest earmarked for vague promises to \"grow basic research\" and \"build the STEM workforce\" and create \"broad-based research opportunities.\" When politicians say \"partnerships,\" they mean big government collaborating with big business.</p><p>The Commerce Department gets $11 billion, most of which it intends to plow into creating 20 new \"regional technology hubs,\" which will somehow expand \"U.S. innovation capacity.\" This is spread-the-money-around political pork. The National Institute of Standards and Technology gets some $10 billion to, among other non-urgent needs, \"promote competitiveness in international standards.\" The Energy Department will receive tens of billions for science and research, on top of what it already gets.</p><p>The 16 Republicans who voted to proceed aren't protesting, so presumably they were in on this game of break-the-filibuster-and-switch. This is political malpractice in addition to violating the GOP's claim to spending restraint. The GOP is making the case, and rightly so, that trillions in spending contributed to the inflation that is killing family budgets. Why give Democrats bipartisan cover on the link between inflation and spending with an election only four months away? Answer: They apparently don't believe their own advertising.</p><p>The Senate floor debate could bring further surprises, and almost none of them will be good. We can't wait to see how Intel and the other beneficiaries react when the politicians attach various strings on their investment decisions and corporate governance.</p><p>One hope is that enough Republicans will come to their political senses to defeat this on a vote for final passage. It's also possible that Democrats in the House could fail to pass this new version. The House narrowly passed its version of a Chips bill in February, and all but one Republican voted no.</p><p>But Democrats are aching for a pre-election victory, and so the skids may be greased. America's bipartisan political class at work.</p><p>The Senate's Semiconductor Spending Trick</p>",
