  "text": "<p>   A James Bond-inspired home under construction at Utah's Deer Valley Resort is asking $33.5 million. </p><p>   The mountaintop home in Park City will measure about 15,000 square feet, said the developer, Matt Alcone of Alcone Ventures. With floor-to-ceiling glass walls and a flat roof, the house will have a sleek, modern design inspired by a glass house seen in the 2015 James Bond film \"Spectre,\" Mr. Alcone said. </p><p>   The house is the most expensive home ever listed for sale at Deer Valley, according to listing agent Steve Jury of Keller Williams Park City. It is also among most expensive homes on the market in Utah, Mr. Jury said. </p><p>   At about 9,000 feet above sea level, the roughly 2-acre property overlooks Park City and the Wasatch Mountains. The home has access to Deer Valley ski trails as well as backcountry skiing, Mr. Alcone said, and sits in the middle of hiking and biking trails. The nearby Provo River is ideal for fly fishing, according to Mr. Jury. </p><p>   Mr. Alcone said he bought the land in two separate transactions in 2020, but declined to say how much he paid. He broke ground on the project last November and expects it to be finished by late 2023 or early 2024, he said. </p><p>   The house will have four bedrooms, all with private bathrooms and patios, as well as a media room and roughly 16 fireplaces, Mr. Alcone said. Intended as a multigenerational family retreat, the house will have an 11-person bunk room with two private bathrooms, two walk-in closets and a patio. </p><p>   Amenities will include a rooftop deck and a 44-foot-long heated outdoor lap pool. An office complex in the house will have a videoconference room, an executive office and a bathroom. Plans also call for a fitness center with a sauna, a steam room and a massage room that opens to the pool deck. The property will have a motor court and multiple garages, including one for ATVs and one for snowmobiles. But the home is still in the early stages of construction, he said, so the design can be modified at the buyer's request. </p><p>   The house will be constructed from hand-cut Montana Moss stone, he said, paired with reclaimed timber along the ceilings and walls to give it a warm feel. </p><p>   Mr. Alcone, who lives primarily in California, said real-estate development is a passion of his. He has built and sold homes in Hawaii and California, he said, and this is his first project in Utah. </p><p></p>",
