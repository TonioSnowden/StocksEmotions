  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>The European Commission today tables a number of proposals on how to curb energy price rises, increase joint purchases and fund bills for households and small businesses. </p> <p>One idea that will be part of the package is to redeploy cohesion funds from the previous EU budget. We will look at this draft proposal and what other measures are set to be presented in Strasbourg — a package aimed at placating as many capitals as possible. EU ambassadors in Luxembourg last night gave an overall thumbs up to what the commission described as a “heroic” package, but expect more agonising about the fine print in the coming days. </p> <p>Also in Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers said yesterday that they would back <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb688526-5d09-4c03-9a43-16ccd18d4728\">fresh sanctions on Iran </a>if Kyiv's allegations prove to be correct — namely that Russia used Iranian-made drones in Ukraine. And separately, the bloc's diplomatic service is exploring options on whether to cover the cost of Elon Musk's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73a4b1b8-b266-40f2-af66-ea9f69a40a7e\">Starlink technology</a> for Ukraine. </p> <p>We will also bring you the latest on the EU strategic autonomy front, with France and Germany having prevailed in defining even less cutting-edge microchip technology as worthy of subsidies.</p> <p>And we will look at why the bloc's Covid-19 vaccine purchase programme is turning into somewhat of a poisoned chalice for commission president Ursula von der Leyen.</p> <h2>Repower grab</h2> <p>Ursula von der Leyen is doing everything she can to prove that the commission will not be coming empty-handed to the energy summit being held on Thursday, write <em><strong>Sam Fleming and Alice Hancock in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>That means not only unveiling a complex array of proposals aimed at improving gas purchases and curbing energy prices, but also helping capitals root out extra money to cushion the impact of surging energy costs (up 40 per cent over the past year).&#xa0;</p> <p>Part of the energy package, due to be unveiled today, is the redeployment of up to €40bn in EU regional and structural funding. The money should be used to help shelter vulnerable households and SMEs from the energy price shock and to support short-time work schemes, according to plans seen by Europe Express.</p> <p>The scheme, spearheaded by cohesion and reforms commissioner Elisa Ferreira, would allow member states to shuffle around cohesion funding still being paid out <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/cohesion-fund/2014-2020#:~:text=The%20Cohesion%20Fund%20is%20aimed,and%20to%20promote%20sustainable%20development.\">under the previous EU budget</a> (2014-20), and boost co-financing rates. </p> <p>It mirrors an effort launched soon after the war started under which extra flexibility was found via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/care/\">so-called CARE scheme</a>, which made it easier for member states to use cohesion funding to pay for the millions of refugees who arrived from Ukraine in the EU. </p> <p>The more controversial elements in today's package, however, are likely to overshadow the financial solutions put forward ahead of Thursday's summit. </p> <p>Front and centre in that discussion will be the role of the commission in temporarily setting the maximum gas price on the Dutch exchange Title Transfer Facility, which is used as a benchmark for European gas prices. (We <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99343eef-2386-42e9-95a9-ec210bf49392\">wrote about it yesterday</a>). </p> <p>Italy and Greece last night demanded tougher language on the price cap, worrying that any further delays would only aggravate the crisis. Northern countries, such as Germany, insist on carefully studying the impact of such a market intervention before signing off on it. </p> <p>“We don't want to end up like the UK, doing something in spite of all warnings and then being punished by the markets,” said one EU diplomat.</p> <p>Other measures to be put forward today, for which support might be slightly easier to garner, are: </p> <ol>  <li><p>The establishment of a joint purchasing “tool” to aggregate demand for gas and co-ordinate buying</p></li>  <li><p>Measures to allow EU capitals to demand more gas consumption reductions from non-vulnerable consumers</p></li>  <li><p>A structure for member states to agree supply arrangements in the event that another EU country is cut off.</p></li> </ol> <h1>Chart du jour: Diversifying gas supplies</h1> <p>The need for member states to collaborate better when it comes to gas buying, rather than focusing on bilateral deals, is underscored today by new figures being released by the <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/national-energy-policy-responses-energy-crisis\">Bruegel think-tank</a>. Italy is the EU country that has enjoyed the greatest success securing fresh supplies, especially when compared with the gas deals struck by Germany.</p> <h2>Blunt-edge chips</h2> <p>Member states have reached a compromise in the debate about what constitutes cutting-edge technology that can be subsidised to boost Europe's “strategic autonomy”. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, France and Germany won the day, meaning that even older-generation technologies can still count as “first of a kind” and benefit from state aid, writes <em><strong>Javier Espinoza in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner, was clear earlier this year: Europe needs to boost its production of chips to move away from the reliance on Asia and other parts of the world. But not just any old “legacy” chips should be subsidised, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/speech_22_888\">she said in May</a>. Rather, state aid should be directed to cutting-edge, nano-technology.</p> <p>Her remarks came when she presented the so-called Chips Act, a €43bn investment plan aimed at boosting production of microchips to reduce the continent's reliance on the US and Asia.</p> <p>But febrile negotiations with Paris and Berlin have watered down that criterion, meaning that even older chips will now qualify for state aid, as long as they bring an “innovative element” to manufacturing or the final product, according to a draft text seen by Europe Express. (This would allow for state aid to flow to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f7e4a87-f0c4-469a-b0cf-7bb3570e31f4\">Intel chip fabs, mainly in Germany</a>, which are not cutting edge in an initial stage).</p> <p>The text explains that such innovation elements are in relation to the size of the microchips, the materials used or&#xa0;“approaches that lead to performance improvements in computing power”.</p> <p>EU officials familiar with the negotiations have sought to put a positive spin on the compromise: “There won't be a general support for every kind of chip. There needs to be an element of innovation.”</p> <p>The Chips Act is expected to be adopted before the end of the year but it has come under criticism. While Paris and Berlin may have won this round, other capitals continue to be unhappy with the compromise, with a coalition of countries, including Denmark and the Netherlands, having warned against Brussels being too protectionist and overstepping its powers in its attempt to secure the supply chain for this technology.</p> <h2>Vaxing problems</h2> <p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has hailed the EU's Covid-19&#xa0;vaccination programme as a great success. But it has also caused her some headaches, writes <em><strong>Andy Bounds in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>The latest is an inquiry by the independent <a href=\"https://www.eppo.europa.eu/en/news/ongoing-eppo-investigation-acquisition-covid-19-vaccines-eu\">European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO)</a> “into the acquisition of Covid-19 vaccines in the European Union”.</p> <p>EPPO's job is to investigate and prosecute fraud, corruption and misappropriation of EU funds in nearly all member states. EU institutions also fall under its remit. The office declined to give further details about this ongoing investigation.</p> <p>Responding to questions about the EPPO announcement, a commission spokesman said it had no knowledge of the probe and had not been contacted by the agency. </p> <p>The emergency procurement programme ensured access to doses for European citizens but at considerable cost. The commission struck advance purchase agreements with manufacturers to get a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe and at a given price. It used undisclosed amounts <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/public-health/eu-vaccines-strategy_en\">from a €2.7bn EU fund as downpayment</a>, to secure deliveries at a time when developed countries were in a bidding war for the scarce supplies. Member states then bought their own doses. Overall, Brussels signed €71bn of contracts for 4.6bn vaccine doses.</p> <p>The programme has already been criticised by other EU bodies, particularly the direct negotiations between von der Leyen and Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla in early 2021. They exchanged several text messages but the commission has declined to provide them as part of freedom of information requests. </p> <p>The European ombudsman, an independent watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/press-release/en/158303\">found the commission guilty </a>of maladministration in July for failing to look for the messages. The commission maintains that such messages are “ephemeral” and not public documents that must be retained. </p> <p>The European Court of Auditors, a financial watchdog, in September <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7410041b-777a-4ac4-a9e6-61d3a7c3d808\">also criticised the commission</a> for lacking transparency over vaccine contracts and refusing to provide any details about the discussions revolving around the contract for 1.8bn doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine signed in May 2021.</p> <p>Pfizer declined to comment on the EPPO investigation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the chair of the European parliament's special committee on the Covid pandemic has said it will ask the Pfizer CEO to appear before it. He had agreed to come in early October but pulled out, sending a colleague. “It is important that he comes to show accountability,” said Kathleen van Brempt, a Belgian socialist. </p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>European Commission tables energy price measures in Strasbourg</p></li>  <li><p>EU affairs ministers meet in Luxembourg</p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mending ties: </strong>The British public would back a pragmatic reset of relations with the EU and has little or no appetite for Liz Truss's post-Brexit deregulation agenda, according to a survey of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c583fe90-395c-42fe-8d82-1bcd0bebd57a\">British public attitudes</a> for the Tony Blair Institute.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>New PM: </strong>Ulf Kristersson will be named Sweden's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b28d03f-20fc-4d29-82c6-6adc0fabdc04\">new prime minister</a> today, the first rightwing politician in the country's modern history to take power because of the support of a far-right party. </p></li> </ul><p>Source: Valentina Pop 2022 'EU seeks to redeploy €40bn for help with energy bills' FT.com 18 October.
