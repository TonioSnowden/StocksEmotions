  "text": "<p>Twitter and Snap run far behind Facebook and Google in digital advertising revenues, but their quarterly results on Thursday suggested the two social media companies were finally achieving significant success with their sales growth initiatives.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98e48b00-0741-4608-9349-f656632a231e\">Hannah Murphy in San Francisco reports</a>, Twitter cited “revenue product improvements, strong sales execution and a broad increase in advertiser demand” as primary drivers of a 74 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to $1.19bn during the second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations.</p> <p>The company recently improved its targeting capabilities and made it simpler for smaller businesses to run campaigns. User engagement with adverts rose 32 per cent in the quarter.</p> <p>In an FT interview, chief financial officer Ned Segal said Twitter wanted to increase ecommerce, as Facebook and TikTok boost investment in the space. It plans to reintroduce a “buy” button on adverts in the future, he said, so that users could purchase directly on the platform without leaving. </p> <p>Other features being developed include tools for tipping or subscribing to content creators, in an attempt to grow engagement and diversify revenues beyond advertising.</p> <p>Snap also posted bumper quarterly results, with sales jumping 116 per cent year-over-year to $982m, well above analysts' expectations of an increase to $846.67m. It has also been building out its “social commerce” capabilities, focusing on using augmented reality to allow users to try out outfits online before purchasing.</p> <p>Snap's chief Evan Spiegel said more than 200m users now engage with augmented reality on Snapchat every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for the community. In May, Snap became the first leading US tech company to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/827c213f-fdd6-4307-8040-8aae8629a784\">unveil AR glasses</a>, and it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6416472c-fcad-4b1d-82c0-aa8fa9e8947c\">bought WaveOptics</a>, a UK-based maker of optical systems for AR headsets, that same month.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley analysts expect AR and other initiatives will enable Snap to compete better with the likes of Facebook and TikTok. “We continue to see Snap's emerging multiple use cases (Discover, Spotlight, AR Shopping, Games, Maps, Minis) leading to durable multiple year growth,” they said in a note on Friday.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. NHS's permissive sharing of patient data</strong><br>More than 40 companies, ranging from the world's largest management consultancies to pharmaceutical groups, have received years of detailed medical records from English hospitals,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f9f6f1f-e2d1-4646-b5ec-7d704e45149e\"> a Financial Times analysis </a>has found. At least 100 different NHS data sets have been shared, including details of every patient admitted, their diagnosis, treatment and any outpatient appointments, and narrower sets of data on emergency care, mental health, mortality, sexual health and maternity services.</p> <p><strong>2. Hedge funds back off Binance</strong><br>Several hedge funds have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cbd5704-42fd-4c9c-b0ab-8bca212b64b8\">backed away from trading</a> and other activities on Binance in response to the accelerating regulatory crackdown on the crypto exchange, increasing the strain on a group already cut off by a clutch of banks and payments companies. In other crypto concerns, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87d55cae-fe45-4041-961c-860f28e9a289\">Alphaville looks at </a>how some experts think cryptocurrencies will become more at risk to the ever increasing performance of quantum computers. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91342189-978f-4d44-9dcf-b993983f08f9\">Gillian Tett examines</a> how blockchain is shaking Swift and the global payments system.</p> <p><strong>3. Zomato delivers on IPO day</strong><br>The Indian food delivery company Zomato saw its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55f803f6-0c6e-4dba-afeb-d45d4307e013\">share price jump as much as 80 per cent </a>on its market debut in Mumbai on Friday, as it became the first of the latest wave of tech start-ups to go public there. Others, including the $16bn payments group Paytm, have been closely watching Zomato's IPO to judge market sentiment.</p> <p><strong>4. Lucid's Spac plans are far from clear</strong><br>The $24bn deal for Lucid Motors to go public <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/102b2b94-f64a-42f5-93ee-45841d54f576\">struggled to cross the finish line</a> after the blank cheque company merging with the electric vehicle start-up failed to put together enough support from retail investors at a crucial shareholder meeting. One proposal on Lucid's incorporation as a public company failed to gain sufficient backing from investors. </p> <p><strong>5. Intel chief not ruling out M&amp;A</strong><br>Intel's new chief executive Pat Gelsinger has given a strong hint that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb9cc57-9cec-4526-b6f9-110ef32b6bfe\">dealmaking will be part</a> of its efforts to strengthen its manufacturing base. He told an analyst call that more consolidation was needed in the chipmaking industry, as Intel reported&#xa0;surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings, thanks to the continued rebound in PC sales. The Silicon Valley company has been reported to be in talks to acquire its rival GlobalFoundries.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tech tools — Pitching tents and tech</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6876587-96c0-4c66-b575-215711c0d80b\">How To Spend It has a guide </a>on how to go camping with the latest gadgets. They include the LuminAID PackLite Power lantern that can be solar powered or charged by phone; the Goal Zero Sherpa 100AC portable power bank, which can recharge your laptop a couple of times over; and the Petzl IKO Core Headlamp, a phenomenally light, splashproof and rechargeable head torch with adjustable brightness up to 500 lumens.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Twitter and Snap's social commerce push' FT.com 23 July.
