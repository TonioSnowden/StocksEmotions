  "title": "5G (A Special Report) --- A Professor Brings 5G Technology to M.B.A.s: David Yoffie has students look for business opportunities that the wireless technology could bring",
  "text": "<p>The professor has spent nearly two decades studying communications technology while teaching at Harvard Business School. He also was on the board of Intel Corp. for 29 years, until 2018, and has been on the board of Taiwanese consumer-electronics company HTC Corp. for about 10 years. Most recently, he's been telling his M.B.A. students they need to learn about 5G to be prepared for the future of business.</p><p>\"When 4G emerged, I was on the board of Intel, and we had no idea what kinds of applications would be possible in a 4G world besides more speed,\" he says. \"If anyone said we'd have Uber or have hundreds of millions of people streaming videos on their phones because of 4G, we would have shaken our head and said 'Sure.'\"</p><p>Prof. Yoffie explains to students that companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Netflix Inc. were the biggest beneficiaries of 4G technology, not the wireless carriers themselves.</p><p>He teaches a case study that shows students the nuts and bolts of 5G technology. But unlike a normal HBS case study, which typically looks back at a past challenge facing an organization and puts the student in the role of the decision maker, this is more about what 5G is, how it works and how it's likely to evolve, he says.</p><p>His goal is to get his students to think of the new entrepreneurship opportunities that could emerge from this latest technology. \"What I tell my students is, this is your great opportunity,\" he says. \"What are things you can do that wouldn't be possible with 4G, what are things they can do to have an impact on the world?\"</p><p>The students often suggest new approaches to gaming, self-driving cars or other consumer-focused ventures, he says. Prof. Yoffie is personally excited about what 5G could mean for the emergence of edge computing, which allows information to be processed at the point it's collected rather than having to travel to central servers. Among other things, he says, that will foster the emergence of smart cities, where edge computing could enable, for instance, the development of systems that make the movement of vehicles and people around cities as efficient as possible by reacting immediately to current conditions. \"Just imagine the amount of data that you'd have to collect and do it all in real time,\" he says. \"You can't do it by sending it to centralized servers in North Carolina or wherever they go.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Thomas is a Wall Street Journal reporter based in New York.
