  "text": "<p>The various incarnations of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6b420f2-68df-465c-a785-f4be348d1eee\">James Bond</a> are some of the most referenced and celebrated in men's style – from Sean Connery's classically British looks to Roger Moore's 1970s Italian flair. As the long-awaited <em>No Time to Die</em> arrives on the big screen, we dissect the outfits and collaborations in Daniel Craig's final outing as 007. </p>  <p><strong>Massimo Alba</strong></p> <p>The Italian tailoring brand is behind Bond's sand-coloured corduroy suit, which he wears with a blue <a href=\"https://www.brunellocucinelli.com\">Brunello Cucinelli</a> button-down shirt. Craig himself is reportedly a customer of <a href=\"https://www.massimoalba.com\">Massimo Alba</a>, and a number of other pieces by the label appear in the film, including grey corduroy trousers and a needlecord duster.</p>  <p><strong>Connolly</strong></p> <p>Craig's practical worker's jacket – a short, lightweight “bomber” with pockets – comes courtesy of the heritage leather goods brand. He also wears an oatmeal Connolly shirt made in collaboration with Neapolitan maker <a href=\"https://www.finamore.it\">Finamore</a>, which the brand has worked with for more than 20 years.</p>  <p><strong>N.Peal</strong></p> <p><em>No Time to Die</em> costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb worked with the British cashmere <a href=\"https://www.npeal.com/\">brand</a> to create a navy army sweater for Daniel Craig's character, which he wears with cargo trousers and combat boots in the film. The collaboration also includes a round-neck cashmere T-shirt, created for Léa Seydoux's character Madeleine Swann.</p>  <p><strong>Tom Ford</strong></p> <p>While Sean Connery wore suits by British tailor Anthony Sinclair, Craig prefers the work of <a href=\"https://www.tomford.co.uk/\">Tom Ford</a>, which he has worn throughout his Bond films. In <em>No Time to Die,</em> he's seen in a navy tuxedo with black shawl lapels, which he stores in a <a href=\"https://www.bennettwinch.com/\">Bennett Winch</a> suit carrier, as well as a grey Prince of Wales check two-piece.</p>  <p><strong>Globe-Trotter</strong> </p> <p>The British luggage brand has a long association with the franchise – its hard cases appeared in both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eec8fbde-7809-11e5-933d-efcdc3c11c89\"><em>Spectre</em></a> and <em>Skyfall</em>. This time around, <a href=\"https://www.globe-trotter.com/\">Globe-Trotter</a> has created two ocean-green vulcanised fibreboard cases that are based on one Bond uses in the film. Moneypenny, on the other hand – played by Naomie Harris – uses luggage by <a href=\"https://www.michaelkors.co.uk/\">Michael Kors</a>, including the leather Bancroft satchel.</p>  <p><strong>Crockett &amp; Jones</strong></p> <p>The Northampton brand's Highbury style was first worn by Craig in <em>Skyfall</em>; this time he wears the black derby shoe as part of his tuxedo look. <a href=\"https://www.crockettandjones.com/\">Crockett &amp; Jones</a>' Molton chukka boot is his footwear of choice for stomping around a forest in <em>No Time to Die</em>.</p><p>Source: Jessica Beresford 2021 'How to dress like James Bond' FT.com 27 September.
