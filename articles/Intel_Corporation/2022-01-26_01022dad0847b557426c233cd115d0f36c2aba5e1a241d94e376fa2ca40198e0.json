  "text": "<p>Intel Corp.'s net income fell last quarter at a time of booming chip sales, highlighting how Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's efforts to revive the semiconductor giant's fortunes are a multiyear affair.</p><p>The chip company posted $20.5 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 3% from the year-ago period, in part reflecting the sale of its memory business. The company generated net income of $4.6 billion, down 21% year-over-year as Intel ramped up investments in new plants and products. Wall Street expected sales of $19.2 billion and net income of $3.2 billion.</p><p>The U.S. semiconductor giant is in a period of transition after falling behind rivals in chip making, and competitors have taken market share from it in some semiconductor categories. Mr. Gelsinger, who took over as CEO in February 2021, has been trying to reverse the decline and said in December that his turnaround plans could take five-plus years.</p><p>Intel shares fell more than 3% in after-hours trading. The stock closed Wednesday's regular trading session around 1% higher at $51.69, after it won a reprieve from a $1.2 billion fine by the European Union's antitrust regulator issued more than a decade ago.</p><p>The quarterly results come amid a sustained global chip shortage, brought on by booming demand during the pandemic for electronic goods and services and snarled supply lines. The chip drought has led to widespread disruptions, including forcing car makers lacking chips to idle plants and driving up prices for some electronic goods.</p><p>Intel over the past year has expanded the company's chip-making capabilities, both domestically and abroad. Most recently, it announced a $20 billion investment last week into new chip-making factories in Ohio, explaining that the semiconductor industry is expected to double from $500 billion in combined annual sales to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.</p><p>\"My intention as CEO is to grow our share of that growing market. So I have to be investing and expanding our capacity faster than doubling,\" Mr. Gelsinger said in an interview last week.</p><p>Intel in 2021 laid out big chip-making investments in Arizona and New Mexico and an approximate $95 billion commitment in Europe.</p><p>The company scored its legal victory in Europe on Wednesday when the EU's General Court in Luxembourg struck down much of a 2009 finding by the regulator that Intel had abused its dominant position by issuing loyalty rebates and payments that restricted rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from competing. The court said that the analysis carried out by the European Commission, the bloc's main antitrust regulator, was incomplete.</p><p>The judgment is a blow to the European Commission, which is seeking to expand its reach through new regulations and a reinterpretation of its existing powers.</p><p>Intel welcomed the outcome. The EU could appeal the outcome and said it was reviewing the judgment.</p><p>Kim Mackrael and Daniel Michaels contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Earnings Drop, Revenue Edges Higher</p>",
