  "text": "<p>Roku ROKU and Alphabet's GOOGGOOGL Google had been in heated negotiations about the future of YouTube and YouTube TV on the Roku platform. Roku had pulled the YouTube TV app from its channel store back in April after the companies failed to agree on terms for the online-cable service.</p><p>Now the companies appear to be on better footing, with a Roku spokesperson saying Wednesday that the two have “agreed to a multi-year extension for both&#xa0;YouTube&#xa0;and&#xa0;YouTube&#xa0;TV.” The arrangement is “a positive development for our shared customers, making both&#xa0;YouTube&#xa0;and&#xa0;YouTube&#xa0;TV available for all streamers on the&#xa0;Roku&#xa0;platform,” the spokesperson continued.</p><p>Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</p><p>Roku's stock was up 10.5% in Wednesday morning trading, while shares of Alphabet were off 0.5%.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?
