  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 315.50 points, or 1%, to close at 32,845.13, booking a third straight day of gains.</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX climbed 57.86 points, or 1.4%, to finish at 4,130.29, rising for a third consecutive day.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 228.09 points, or 1.9%, to end at 12,390.69, also scoring a three-day win streak.</p><p>For the week, the Dow gained 3%, the S&amp;P 500 rose 4.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 4.7%. For July, the Dow climbed 6.7%, the S&amp;P 500 jumped 9.1% and the Nasdaq surged 12.3%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>What drove markets?</p><p>The U.S. stock market closed out July with large monthly gains after a week packed with big-tech company earnings, the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, and economic data including the latest reading on inflation.</p><p>\"This was a big week of economic data and earnings,\" said Tom Mantione, a managing director with UBS Private Wealth Management, in a phone interview Friday. The market was positioned for \"bad news and so far this week they haven't gotten it,\" he said, adding that \"earnings so far this season have not been as bad as people anticipated.\"</p><p>Traders reacted favorably to results from tech giants Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com Inc, with Amazon AMZN surging 10.4% Friday while Apple gained 3.3%, according to FactSet data.</p><p>\"After the close [on Thursday] Apple and Amazon reported earnings on the stronger side of what we've seen for mega-caps so far, with both releases containing optimism around supply chains and consumer spending,\" said strategists at Deutsche Bank, in a note Friday.</p><p>See: Amazon stock jumps 14% as sales beat and AWS growth overcome a second straight quarterly loss</p><p>Also see: Apple says macro issues aren't hurting iPhone business as earnings top expectations</p><p>On the economic front, inflation data released Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that higher gasoline prices led the personal-consumption-expenditures price index up 1% in June, exceeding forecasts of 0.9%.</p><p>\"This inflation metric is for June and we know much has changed since then, especially gas prices so investors should put this inflation report into historical context,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in an emailed note Friday. \"Looking ahead, July inflation rates will ease a bit from the previous month as food and energy costs should wane in July.\"</p><p>Still, June inflation measured by the PCE index showed the cost of living over the past year climbed 6.8%, the highest rate since January 1982, in a sign that price pressures in the economy are still intense and unlikely to relent quickly.</p><p>See: U.S. inflation surges again and stays at 40-year high, key price gauge shows</p><p>\"The numbers today were another reminder that we can't just pretend that inflation isn't going to be the problem for a data dependent Fed,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.</p><p>But equity bulls continued to focus on better-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes that the Fed may become less aggressive raising interest rates as the economy slows. The central bank concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday with another rate hike of three quarters of a percentage point in an effort to curb soaring inflation.</p><p>\"Investors were geared up for a more aggressive tone\" from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and also had \"a lot of angst\" about this earnings season, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, by phone Friday. \"Market expectations were so depressed that a little bit of good news can go a long way.\"</p><p>Read: Was Fed's Powell dovish or not? 4 key takeaways from Wednesday's press conference.</p><p>With nearly half of companies having reported results for the second quarter, the S&amp;P 500 has so far seen a blended profits growth rate of 7.6%, with 76% beating profit forecasts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p><p>Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said the positive mood in global equities was partly due to Thursday's weaker than expected U.S. GDP numbers, which were seen reducing the pace of Fed rate hikes.</p><p>\"Yes bad news is good! [Fed chair] Powell did say the next hike will be data-dependent; will this be a leading indicator to a moderating Fed path or a selling opportunity into a bear rally?\" Innes added.</p><p>Stocks rallied in July, with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow each scoring their best month since November 2020 while the Nasdaq booked its biggest monthly gains since April 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq saw its best July ever, the S&amp;P 500 had its strongest July since 1939 and the Dow booked its best July performance since 2010.</p><p>But Americans are feeling gloomy. A final reading from the University of Michigan's July consumer sentiment gauge on Friday came in at 51.5, compared with the consensus 51.1. That's near an all-time low as consumers worry about the soaring cost of living.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>* Intel Corp. INTC shares dropped 8.6% after the company reported that its revenue in the second quarter declined by 22% compared with the same period last year.</p><p>* Chevron Corp. CVX and Exxon Mobil Corp.

London's FTSE 100 Index UK:UKX closed up 1.1% Friday for a weekly gain of 2% and a monthly rise of 3.5%.</p><p>* In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index CN:SHCOMP closed 0.9% lower Friday for a weekly decline of 0.5% and a monthly drop of 4.3%.
