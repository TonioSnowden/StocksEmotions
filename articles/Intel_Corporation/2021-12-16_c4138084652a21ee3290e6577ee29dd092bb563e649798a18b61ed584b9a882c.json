  "title": "AT&T's ‘clearer' story could give new life to beaten-down stock, analyst says in upgrade",
  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley's Simon Flannery upgraded AT&amp;T's stock T to overweight from equal-weight Thursday, citing several “important catalysts” in the first half of next year that could give new life to AT&amp;T's struggling stock, which has lost 24% over the past year as the S&amp;P 500 SPX has increased 27%.</p><p>AT&amp;T shares are up 3.6% in Thursday morning trading.</p><p>Flannery is upbeat about the impending closure of Discovery Inc.'s DISCAmerger with AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, which could take place by the middle of next year. Once that deal is complete, AT&amp;T will be left with “a much clearer and focused communications business,” he wrote.</p><p>Investors may come to better appreciate AT&amp;T's communications business after the WarnerMedia deal closes, according to Flannery. “We believe AT&amp;T's core communications business is undervalued and should re-rate as we get more clarity on the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction,” he wrote, meaning that the market could assign a higher multiple to this part of the business.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?

Additionally, executives could soon shed more light about how they will approach dividend policy after the WarnerMedia spinoff.</p><p>Flannery cheered AT&amp;T's “solid” financials and recent operating performance, highlighting the company's “industry-leading postpaid phone adds.” While a slowdown in overall wireless industry growth and emerging competitive threats “create clear downside risks” for the market, Flannery says those worries are already largely reflected in AT&amp;T's share price.</p><p>He cut his price target to $28 from $32 in conjunction with his upgrade, but he still thinks AT&amp;T's shares are undervalued: “At these levels we believe the stock is discounting an overly negative outlook; indeed less than one third of the covering analysts have a positive rating on the stock.”</p>",
