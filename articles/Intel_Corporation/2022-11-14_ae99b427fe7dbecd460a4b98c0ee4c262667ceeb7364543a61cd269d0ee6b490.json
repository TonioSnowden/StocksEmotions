  "title": "Oatly stock tumbles 12% as company's loss widens amid production snags at a U.S. plant and COVID lockdowns in Asia; Oat-milk maker to pivot to asset-light strategy as it works to scale up production to meet robust demand",
  "text": "<p>\"Third-quarter financial results were below our expectations, largely driven by COVID-19 restrictions in Asia, production challenges in the Americas, and continued foreign exchange headwinds,\" Chief Executive Toni Petersson said in a statement.</p><p>The company had a technical issue at a plant in Ogden, Utah, Petersson told analysts on the company's conference call. It believes these problems are transitory and that underlying demand for its products remains robust.</p><p>\"I am disappointed with our ability to translate this third-quarter gross profit margin and sequential EBITDA improvement due to our operational execution shortcomings,\" the executive said, according to a FactSet transcript.</p><p>See also: Salesforce, Beyond Meat, Meta, Twitter, Lyft, Intel, Snap, Robinhood. Here are the companies making major layoffs</p><p>The company had a net loss of $107.9 million, or 18 cents a share, in the quarter, wider than the loss of $41.2 million, or 7 cents a share, posted in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $183 million from $171.1 million a year ago.</p><p>The FactSet consensus was for a loss of 10 cents and revenue of $210 million.</p><p>The company is now expecting full-year revenue of $700 million to $720 million, well below the consensus of $793.20 million.</p><p>Read also: Beyond Meat shares slide after revenue warning, fresh job cuts â€” and exit for exec who allegedly bit a man's nose</p><p>Oatly is taking strategic measures to adapt its supply chain network and simplify its structure with the aim of using an asset-light approach to improving profitability. That's expected to greatly reduce capex going forward.</p><p>The company is also pursuing manufacturing partners to create a hybrid production network in certain regions. It expects to cut overhead and head count to cut up to 25% of costs related to group corporate functions and regional EMEA layers, seeking up to $50 million in annual savings by the first half of 2023.</p><p>For more: U.S. plant-based food market value reaches a high of $7.4 billion, but industry faces rough path to further growth</p><p>Mizuho said the numbers heighten liquidity concerns and are keeping it on the sidelines.</p><p>\"Macro pressures from COVID lockdowns in Asia and a weakening Europe backdrop are significant, and ongoing challenges ramping new Utah facility remain particularly concerning,\" John. J. Baumgartner, managing director of research, wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>\"A head count reorg and other efficiencies target $50 million of annualized savings by 1H23, but are more than outweighed by revenue and liquidity concerns.\"</p><p>Mizuho has a neutral rating on the stock and is sticking with its $3.50 price target.</p><p>But CFRA said it's sticking with its buy rating, while lowering its price target to $3.50 from $5.00.</p><p>\" While the Q3 results and outlook were clearly disappointing, the positive is OTLY does not seem to be having a demand issue. Instead, we believe sales growth is mostly tied to production capacity, which should step up in Q4 and 2023,\" said analyst Arun Sundaram.</p><p>He welcomed the company's \"major pivot\" to an asset-light model, which should accelerate the path to profitability, although \"it will likely have some implications on its long-term gross margin goal of at least 40%.\"</p><p>Oatly shares have fallen 76% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 16%.</p><p>Oatly stock tumbles 12% as company's loss widens amid production snags at a U.S. plant and COVID lockdowns in Asia</p>",
