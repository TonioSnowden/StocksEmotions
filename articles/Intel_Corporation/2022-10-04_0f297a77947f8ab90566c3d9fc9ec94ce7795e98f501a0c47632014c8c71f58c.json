  "title": "Tesla/Mobileye: driverless car chase is speeding up",
  "text": "<p>Driverless cars are appearing on US city roads. A technological fantasy is becoming a reality and rational optimism is replacing hype. Expectations for Intel's Mobileye spin-off have accordingly cooled. </p> <p>The autonomous driving business once had a mooted worth of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a5c21b0-0432-4c13-8680-ce490f2ac50e\">$50bn</a>. It is now expected to seek a valuation of about $30bn. Tesla has meanwhile acknowledged that its “Full Self-Driving” software rollout will be slowed by the need for regulatory approval. </p> <p>Advanced driver-assistance systems take control of driving functions such as emergency braking and maintaining speed. It is a stepping stone on the way to fully autonomous vehicles. </p> <p>Mobileye has developed cutting-edge chips and software for driverless cars. The bulk of 100mn vehicles with camera-based ADAS use Mobileye software, according to Guidehouse Insights. The company says another 266mn vehicles will deploy its systems by 2030.</p> <p>Intel bought the Israel-based company in 2017 for $15.3bn. Mobileye's growth has outpaced that of its parent company. But Mobileye accounted for only 3 per cent of group revenue in the past quarter and has done little to support Intel's falling valuation. It does not aid the chipmaker's efforts to improve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4cd31af-48e6-4492-bca4-b7da68926a1f\">manufacturing technology</a> to compete better with rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices. </p> <p>A listing will provide Intel with capital for expansion. It is shrewdly keeping majority ownership via shares with 10 times the voting rights of those it sells.</p> <p>At $30bn, lossmaking Mobileye would be valued at 22 times trailing revenue. On the same metric, Tesla is valued at 14 time. Mobileye sees the electric vehicle manufacturer as a rival in the consumer autonomous vehicle market.</p> <p>Tesla's valuation dipped slightly on disappointing delivery numbers in the past quarter. A total of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16456af8-4aff-4153-a6fe-cdfaecef81c3?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#comments-anchor\">343,830 vehicles</a> delivered was some 200,000 more than in the same quarter two years ago.</p> <p>Long-term plans for fleets of autonomous vehicles underpin valuations. These remain too nebulous to price precisely. But growing proof driverless cars are viable brings widescale robotaxi deployment closer too.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Tesla/Mobileye: driverless car chase is speeding up' FT.com 4 October.
