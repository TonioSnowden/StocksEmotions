  "title": "U.S. sues to block Nvidia merger with Arm, the largest semiconductor deal in history",
  "text": "<p>The FTC said in an announcement that Nvidia's NVDA “proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop their own competing chips.” Commissioners voted 4-0 to block the merger, and an administrative trial is set to begin in August 2022.</p><p>&#xa0;“Tomorrow's technologies depend on preserving today's competitive, cutting-edge chip markets,” FTC Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova said in a statement. “This proposed deal would distort Arm's incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia's rivals.”</p><p>Subscribe: Want intel on all the news moving markets?

JP:9984 has met with several headwinds since it was announced back in late 2020, and the company said in its last earnings report in mid-November it was working with the FTC to address concerns raised by the deal. The $40 billion deal, the largest in the history of the semiconductor sector, has also been targeted by European Union and U.K. regulators.</p><p>Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress confirmed to MarketWatch in August that if the deal was not completed by September 2022, SoftBank would get to keep a $1.25 billion down payment as a breakup fee.</p><p>Nvidia shares were up about 2% when the statement came out and closed up 2.2% at $321.26.</p>",
