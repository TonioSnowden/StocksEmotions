  "title": "Biden Avoids Some Battleground States in Midterms' Final Stretch; Facing low approval ratings and frustration over economy, president skips such high-profile states as Arizona, Nevada and Georgia",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden has made three trips to New York and two to Maryland—solidly Democratic states with some competitive races in November—but has visited Michigan and Wisconsin only once each. The only top presidential battleground he has visited repeatedly is Pennsylvania, his birthplace.</p><p>On Monday, he made another trip to New York for a private memorial service.</p><p>With more than half of Americans disapproving of Mr. Biden's job approval, according to a recent Wall Street Journal poll, his campaign strategy reflects the challenge facing an unpopular president in a midterm cycle, Democrats said. As some Democratic candidates keep their distance, he is focusing on official events to promote his agenda, policy speeches at the White House and fundraisers. The approach differs from that of former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, who both campaigned more during the first midterm election after they took the White House, but their parties still faced heavy losses.</p><p>\"The problem this cycle, in terms of where we are today and where we are headed, is that it's not clear what is safe anymore,\" said Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis. \"I'm not surprised he's not going to Arizona or Nevada. The question is—is he helping or hurting in Pennsylvania or New York? That part is not clear. I don't see many candidates clamoring for him to come.\"</p><p>Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who is running for Senate, recently told CBS News he wouldn't ask the president to campaign with him. \"I want to be the main face, the main messenger,\" he said. When Mr. Biden visited Ohio in early September to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel Corp.'s semiconductor facility, Mr. Ryan was in attendance, but he distanced himself from the president in interviews around the event. Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the Democratic candidate for Senate, skipped a Labor Day event with Mr. Biden in Milwaukee. Mr. Barnes didn't respond to a request for comment. He told local media at the time that his schedule was full.</p><p>Republicans said Mr. Biden's policies are a drag on his party. \"Biden can't step foot in a swing district without reminding voters of Democrat-caused inflation, surging crime and high gas prices,\" said Nathan Brand, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Democrats have argued that their legislative efforts, including the recent healthcare, climate and tax law, are popular.</p><p>Analysts from both parties say Republicans are likely to gain more than the net five seats needed to take the majority in the House, while control of the 50-50 Senate could fall to either party.</p><p>Mr. Biden said Saturday that he would be on the trail \"making the case that this is not a referendum, it's a choice, a fundamental choice, a choice between two very different visions for the country.\"</p><p>Allies noted that Mr. Biden has been clear that he will respect candidates' wishes when it comes to where he campaigns in person. In choosing where to dispatch Mr. Biden, the White House is balancing a variety of factors, such as where he can help Democratic candidates, whether an appearance in a state would help the entire ticket and how he might elevate a particular issue.</p><p>Mr. Biden will visit Florida on Tuesday for a Democratic National Committee rally in support of Senate nominee Rep. Val Demings and gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist, who trail Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis, respectively, in the GOP-leaning state. On Thursday, he will head to New Mexico to help Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who faces Republican Mark Ronchetti in her re-election bid.</p><p>The president also is expected to return to Pennsylvania on Nov. 5 with Mr. Obama on behalf of Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman, who is running against Republican Mehmet Oz in a tossup race. Mr. Biden will attend a rally the night before the election in Maryland.</p><p>Mr. Biden isn't expected to visit Arizona, Nevada or Georgia or make additional trips to Wisconsin or Michigan, people familiar with the plans said. Democrats close to the White House noted that he has been in Oregon and New York, where Democrats are in competitive governor's races, and pointed to his fundraising efforts.</p><p>\"He's on the road and he's raising a boatload of money for Democratic candidates,\" said Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser to the DNC.</p><p>Since Sept. 1, Mr. Biden has visited 14 states. He has held 17 fundraisers and has also given speeches from the White House or Washington, D.C., area to highlight issues of importance to Democrats, such as abortion and student debt.</p><p>During the same period in 2010, Mr. Obama visited 20 states and held 28 fundraisers. In 2018, Mr. Trump visited 25 states and held 18 fundraisers, according to data provided by former CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who tracks presidential data, and by Brendan Doherty, a professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p><p>Messrs. Trump and Obama each held a large number of political rallies as part of their efforts, which Mr. Biden hasn't done. Cristobal Alex, a former deputy cabinet secretary in the Biden White House, said those events weren't a requirement on the trail: \"President Biden won in 2020 with the largest turnout ever and there were no major rallies at the end of that election.\"</p><p>As a former vice president, Mr. Biden was an active surrogate for Democrats in 2018, traveling to 24 states in support of 65 candidates.</p><p>Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Avoids Some Battleground States in Midterms' Final Stretch</p>",
