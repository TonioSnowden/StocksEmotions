  "title": "Intel Prices Widely Anticipated IPO for Self-Driving Car Unit Mobileye; Company raises $861 million by selling 41 million shares, valuing it at roughly $17 billion",
  "text": "<p>The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Intel was expected to price the IPO at or above the top of its targeted range of $18 to $20 a share.</p><p>Pricing any IPO right now is tricky given the parlous state of the market. Sharp swings in major stock indexes as interest rates barrel higher have hammered the IPO market in 2022. IPOs in the U.S. had raised only $7.4 billion so far this year, putting 2022 on track to be the worst year for new issues in decades, according to Dealogic.</p><p>Technology companies broadly have been among the hardes-hit sectors over the past 12 months, with the Nasdaq Composite down 26% from this point last year compared with the S&amp;P 500's roughly 15% loss. Driverless-car technology was in hot demand several years ago, but that has also cooled. Mobileye in addition faces stiff competition, including from Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and Amazon.com Inc.'s Zoox.</p><p>Intel and its underwriters were determined to plow forward with the IPO, expected to be the last major listing of the year, with the chipmaker's Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger having said that Intel doesn't need the money that the Mobileye offering would generate. Listing Mobileye would give the self-driving car unit a higher profile and attract more business, he has said.</p><p>In order to get the deal done, Intel adjusted its offering, selling fewer shares than plannedâ€”representing only about 5% to 6% of those that will ultimately be outstanding. It also lined up what are known as cornerstone buyers for roughly 40% of the deal.</p><p>Executives and underwriters overseeing the deal are keen for the shares to trade well, so they were mindful of not pricing them too high.</p><p>Mobileye is set to start trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol MBLY.</p><p>Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@dowjones.com</p><p>Intel Prices Widely Anticipated IPO for Self-Driving Car Unit Mobileye</p>",
