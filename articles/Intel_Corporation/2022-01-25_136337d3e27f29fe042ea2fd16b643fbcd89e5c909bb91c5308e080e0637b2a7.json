  "title": "Nvidia stock falls after report says company could give up on Arm deal",
  "text": "<p>The semiconductor company has faced regulatory opposition to the $40 billion combination and has told partners that it doesn't expect that the deal will close, according to Bloomberg, which cites an unnamed source.</p><p>Additionally, SoftBank SFTBYJP:9984 is considering turning Arm public through an initial public offering assuming that the deal doesn't occur, per the Bloomberg report.</p><p>Shares of Nvidia NVDA were down nearly 4% premarket.</p><p>“We continue to hold the views expressed in detail in our latest regulatory filings—that this transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation,” an Nvidia spokesperson said.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission sued in December to block Nvidia's proposed Arm takeover and the U.K. opened an investigation into the national-security impacts of the deal earlier in 2021.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Nvidia's deal for ARM is dead — how long until CEO Jensen Huang admits it?</p><p>Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote following the Bloomberg report that he doubted investors would be surprised if the deal fell through given heavy pushback from regulators and customers.</p><p>“It feels safe to say that virtually no one in the investment community has expected it to close anyway,” he said in a note to clients.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?

The S&amp;P 500 SPX has dipped 3.4% over the past three months but risen 14.4% on a 12-month basis.</p>",
