  "text": "<p>The UK's <strong>Civil Aviation Authority</strong> has rejected <strong>Heathrow</strong>'s bid to raise landing fees by more than 90 per cent over the next five years — and the airport's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da61626-e6d4-441e-88e6-e2045d1e0f17\">attempt to recover</a> more than £2bn of pandemic-related losses. </p> <p>Heathrow had asked the CAA to increase the cap on charges per passenger to between £32 and £43. At the top end, that is close to double the £22 charged last year.</p> <p>The CAA has said in a consultation published this morning that the airport can't raise fees by that much. But they will still be going up, potentially quite significantly. </p> <p>The regulator has set out a “potential range” of airport charges per passenger of £24.50 to £34.40, up from £22 in 2020. The range will be narrowed after talks with Heathrow, airlines and other stakeholders in the next few months. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Gambling group <strong>888</strong> has warned that its decision to stop providing services in the Netherlands following policy changes by the local gambling regulator will hit profits. The “temporary closure” while 888 seeks a local licence will hit 2022 ebitda by around $10m, the company said. </p> <p>Payments group <strong>Wise</strong> said its “take rate” has fallen from 0.8 per cent a year ago to 0.74 per cent in its latest quarter as a result of cutting prices for customers. The group, which listed in July, said its expectations for revenue growth remained unchanged. It now expects gross margin to be 65-67 per cent up from 62 per cent last year. </p> <p>It is a bad time to be a price comparison site. Travel insurance revenues still haven't recovered to pre-pandemic levels. And now the energy price rises mean providers have removed tariffs from the market and switching has ground to a halt. But <strong>Moneysupermarket</strong> said this morning that nonetheless full-year ebitda would be in line with market expectations. </p> <p>Yesterday, the UK government intervened in the attempted takeover of British aerospace and defence group <strong>Meggitt</strong> by US rival Parker Hannifin on national security grounds. It has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24738530-8407-473a-b22d-c4066f72eb81\">referred the deal</a> for a formal investigation that is due to conclude by 18 March next year. The deal could still go ahead. </p> <p>And the planned sale of <strong>Asda's</strong> petrol stations to its owners' other company, EG Group, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f18a086-c73a-4555-bad3-85dcf609c2c7\">has collapsed</a>. That means that Asda will take on an extra £500m in debt since it can no longer count on cash from the sale of the forecourts. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>German media group <strong>Axel Springer </strong>has ousted the editor of Europe's largest newspaper Bild after accusing him of continuing to mix his “private and professional affairs” and giving false statements to the publisher's board, Olaf Storbeck reports. Julian&#xa0;Reichelt was alleged to have promoted his girlfriends and demoted them after their affairs ended. He was exonerated by an earlier investigation into alleged misconduct. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0159f7e-13cb-44a5-9771-d0eeb42b45f3\">His dismissal came</a> a day after the New York Times reported fresh details of that investigation. </p> <p><strong>Apple</strong> has cemented its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1889b563-1eef-431b-8b2f-74e52e007fbf\">break from Intel</a> with laptops powered by its own “Apple Silicon” chips. The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro notebooks both feature M1-Pro chips. </p> <p>And in further chip news, Chinese group <strong>Alibaba </strong>has unveiled its own in-house chip — this time for servers — built using infrastructure provided by UK semiconductor and software designer Arm. The chip, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7e72227-f396-4c4f-a824-b134e2dbe55c#post-cfa2e41b-1f3f-4c24-b28f-b72903840159\">which rivals the most advanced ones used in the west</a>, will be deployed in Alibaba's in-house servers at its data centres. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Sarah O'Connor</strong> turns her pen to vets in her employment column this week. She highlights that while, in the eyes of investors, the vet business is booming, burnt out vets and nurses are leaving the profession. “Every labour shortage of 2021 has its roots in deeper problems which have gone unresolved for years,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd9dc4ec-e793-4dcf-9926-1c61d32bb733\">she says</a>. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Heathrow faces setback over landing fee rises' FT.com 19 October.
