  "text": "<p>The wheels are coming off Toyota's so-far smooth ride through the global chip crisis, with the world's largest carmaker announcing on Thursday it would<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89bd676c-fc10-4a69-9b03-dc50ed3f441d\"> slash global production by 40 per cent </a>next month.</p> <p>The Japanese company reported a record quarterly profit only two weeks ago as it took advantage of US rivals' component shortages. Toyota was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/666210a5-b107-4daa-8c95-8a734c345339\">able to dip into a semiconductor stockpile</a> it had built up, helped by the proximity of local chip producer Renesas</p> <p>But now a combination of the chip shortage and Covid-19 <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Toyota-to-cut-global-production-by-40-in-September-on-ASEAN-outbreaks\">hitting production for component suppliers</a> in Vietnam and Malaysia has forced it to cut planned September production of 900,000 vehicles to 540,000. </p> <p>Its shares fell more than 4 per cent on the news and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ba8c1cd-75e7-4b6e-97fb-9242ca7b537c\">Alphaville speculates </a>that investors' fears about the brittleness of the global supply chain contributed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/103784f3-89e9-4f7a-bdc9-6d340345373b\">today's market falls</a>.</p> <p>In other chip news, Nvidia said overnight it was still “confident” of sealing its deal for semi designer Arm, but that delays in regulatory approvals are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480?\">likely to push out </a>the 18-month timetable for completion. There is speculation that this could prompt a rethink by owner SoftBank, which could opt for a stock market listing for Arm instead. Meanwhile, Nvidia's rival Intel has unveiled <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/press-kit-architecture-day-2021.html#gs.9blegl\">a new generation of chip architectures </a>today.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Facebook faces fresh antitrust complaint . . . </strong><br>The US Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2035020e-8594-4ae7-997b-9a194c8350bc\">refiled its antitrust complaint </a>against Facebook, doubling down on its accusations that it maintains monopoly power and uses a “buy or bury” strategy to neutralise competitors. Initially filed in December, the original lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in June who said it had “failed to plead enough facts”.</p> <p><strong>2 . . . but it's pressing ahead with a digital wallet</strong><br>David Marcus, the executive who spearheaded the social media group's move into digital currencies, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8512417-1fde-481a-b282-2f892e3c3b51\">Facebook is ready to launch</a> a digital wallet. In <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidmarcus/good-stablecoins-a-protocol-for-money-and-digital-wallets-the-formula-to-fix-our-broken-payment-f11f59fc92d7\">a memo on Wednesday</a>, Marcus said that Novi, a digital currency wallet that will be integrated into Facebook apps, had secured licences or regulatory approvals in “nearly every” US state.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>3. SEC sues Netflix engineers over insider trading</strong><br>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79ce8a38-002a-43a7-86cd-508c0221ca5a\">sued three former Netflix engineers </a>over insider trading, alleging they made more than $3m in profits by trading on subscriber numbers before they were released publicly.</p> <p><strong>4. Ex-SEC chair believes in blockchain</strong><br>Jay Clayton, the former SEC chair, has told us he believes both in the promise of blockchain technology and the need for more regulation for the crypto sector. He was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/293ed291-cdac-48a5-b405-6d85c2c05b7c\">speaking to the FT </a>as he joined the advisory board of digital asset infrastructure provider <strong>Fireblocks</strong>. Elsewhere, US cryptocurrency exchange <strong>Coinbase</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6be38be8-2589-4c82-9963-7bc631ff8155\">struck a deal</a> with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, betting the Japanese bank's vast customer base will help it secure a foothold in one of the world's centres for digital asset trading. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c7aa366-b0f6-4aea-9ce2-a39bae47e329\">Lex has been looking</a> at the <strong>Robinhood</strong> trading app's maiden results and says it has a long way to go for meaningful growth.</p> <p><strong>5. Gopuff raises $1bn, cuts workers' pay</strong><br>Less than a month after it secured $1bn in venture capital, delivery app Gopuff has slashed pay for many of its gig workers to rates that sometimes fall below minimum wage after accounting for expenses, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38ff871a-5066-4072-92fc-2ca6bd768806\">reports Dave Lee in San Francisco</a>.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;— the European start-up week</h2> <p>This week, Peter Thiel's investment fund Valar Ventures led a $263m funding round into the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/bitpanda-peter-thiel/\">crypto trading platform Bitpanda</a>, which valued the company at $4.1bn. It wasn't so much the size of the round that was remarkable, however. What was unusual was that the three founders&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/bitpanda-peter-thiel/\">still own 50 per cent of the company</a>&#xa0;at this late stage, making them near billionaires. It's a sign of the sheer amount of money flowing into European start-ups at the moment but also the continuing excitement around the crypto market.<br><br>On the same theme of people getting rich in tech, Sifted reported this week that London-based fintech&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/revolut-valuation-millionaires/\">Revolut has turned more than 70 ordinary employees into paper millionaires</a>&#xa0;from stock options in the $33bn company.

It allows workers to sit with colleagues, chat and collaborate using virtual whiteboards. “The idea is you go in, wherever you are, you can have your perfect set-up, people can stop in and collaborate quickly. But it's really great for focused work,” Zuckerberg — in avatar form — told reporters. “What we're trying to move towards is a world where a lot of what we do is in here . . . We think it's going to be a big use case for VR.”</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Toyota slashes as semis squeezed' FT.com 19 August.
