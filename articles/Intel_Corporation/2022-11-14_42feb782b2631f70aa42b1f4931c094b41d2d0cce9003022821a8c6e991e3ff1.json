Here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64d5e545-f571-48c2-b76d-6e13a69cedb3\">explainer</a> on what we've learned from last week's polls and here's commentator Megan Greene's take on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac6ebcf0-a03e-4a02-821b-a428eb659771\">what it means for investors</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>Jeff Bezos pledged to give away most of his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a1b87d8-696c-4259-b30a-e140e49bbfd4\">$124bn fortune</a> during his lifetime. The Amazon founder commented: “The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way. It's not easy.”</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df289921-1113-4aba-8016-ae64801b60ed\"><em>live blog</em></a></p>  <p>Good evening.</p> <p>Russia's aggression in Ukraine and tensions over Taiwan were the key issues as world leaders gathered for the <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/\">G20 summit</a> in Bali today, an event dubbed&#xa0;the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55428d56-fa9c-4c78-8f0e-59b34e094931\">first global summit of the second cold war</a>”.</p> <p>Ahead of tomorrow's formal meeting, US president Joe Biden — buoyed by favourable results in the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fdaab3f-cd0d-4062-b870-48ffb1fa3976\">midterms</a> — met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for three and a half hours in their first face-to-face meeting as leaders.</p> <p>After optimistic words about “keeping lines of communication open” and “managing our differences” in a post-meeting press conference, the White House said Biden had criticised China's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c94ff50c-b3cf-4f94-a76a-c521d7c9063c\">coercive and increasingly aggressive actions</a>” toward Taiwan. &#xa0;</p> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1221fae6-c5d0-4cc0-8e6b-227a041098d9\">visit to the island</a> this summer had provoked a strong reaction from Beijing, leading it to launch military exercises and suspend routine communications on issues such as climate change. </p> <p>The first and dominant item on the formal G20 agenda tomorrow however remains Russia's war in Ukraine, followed by a session on global health, with a third on digital issues. </p> <p>None of the G20 (comprising 19 states and the EU) sided with Russia to oppose a UN resolution condemning Moscow's attempted annexation of parts of Ukraine, but three members — China, India and South Africa — abstained. China says it is neutral on the conflict, but has backed Moscow's claim that the US-led expansion of Nato is what triggered the invasion. Conspicuous by his absence is Russian president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0be2143-48df-4501-9bfe-60d73be4a5b6\">Vladimir Putin</a>, who has sent foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in his place.</p> <p>Separately, CIA chief Bill Burns today warned Russia against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bcee5c1-99be-45fa-bea0-8ef10648b31c\">using nuclear weapons</a> in the first known in-person meeting between senior officials of the two countries since the invasion, while Nato said it would not pressure Ukraine into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fef2cfd-456b-431b-b2f9-1376808ed84a\">peace talks</a>, promising continued support for the country.</p> <p>The G20 meeting also presents a rare moment on the international stage for Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president and summit host. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c6acfb0-2a25-4b46-8fa4-a93794e2b7b1\">interview with the FT</a> last week, the head of the world's fourth most populous country expressed frustration that the G20 was being seen as a political forum, rather than the economic and development meeting originally intended. Judging by today's headlines, he's likely to remain disappointed.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p>The UK's fiscal watchdog estimates that government borrowing will be a much higher than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/133589fd-ba37-4963-9113-e1c47c28d4d7\">£100bn</a> as chancellor Jeremy Hunt prepares for his <strong>Autumn Statement</strong>, likely to feature news of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d86fdcc3-e14b-42d6-848b-3f7dd11f8140\">higher taxes for all</a> and an overhaul of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8471b33-21cf-470b-8302-e44323ee22df\">R&amp;D tax credits</a>. Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf says the Tories need to ditch their outmoded ideology and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51ea4356-1e86-4a95-848c-83c49e1af5d4\">raise taxes</a>. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4d9dffb-238d-47fe-b2db-d32c52c31e83\">five things to look out for</a> on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>Eurozone industrial production</strong> rose by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df289921-1113-4aba-8016-ae64801b60ed#post-c1957ed1-b7ee-4bd6-a6cc-c8a5b7119298\">more than expected</a> 0.9 per cent in September as supply chain problems eased. One analyst said companies might be bringing forward production to avoid energy supply disruptions this winter.</p> <p>The <strong>German government</strong> nationalised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df289921-1113-4aba-8016-ae64801b60ed#post-633faf5c-caff-4e7f-8a21-15aff58376b6\">Gazprom's German subsidiary</a> in a move it said was designed to safeguard the country's gas&#xa0;supply. The company's “over-indebtedness” had left it in danger of insolvency, the economy ministry said.</p> <p>Russian attacks have damaged much of <strong>Ukraine's energy infrastructure</strong>, and exacerbated an already dire financial situation for Kyiv, which says it needs $55bn in international assistance for next year. Businesses are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1162892a-0ec4-4a4b-bfc6-6290338f11d1\">clinging on in the darkness</a>. A Ukraine minister warned the state could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd52f059-9564-4b6c-9224-5328ee965d8f\">seize more corporate assets</a> to help the war effort.</p> <p>Our Big Read discusses the legal fallout from a <strong>mortgage time bomb</strong> that threatens to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19235a7a-36f1-41a4-b58f-6adfdea53220\">push Polish banks under</a> and do serious damage to the economy.</p> <h1>Need to know: Global economy</h1> <p>Another Big Read, published earlier today, looks at how <strong>North Korea</strong> has become a cyber crime superpower, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dec696d4-fd51-4cce-bbd9-1dee911eb4cd\">cryptocurrency theft</a>, which has become one of the regime's main sources of revenue. </p> <p>The <strong>global housing market</strong> is set for the broadest slowdown <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76e8b499-2381-463d-ac6d-9d3507f150c3\">since the financial crisis</a> as rising mortgage payments and a deepening cost of living crisis put paid to the pandemic-induced boom. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11600732.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>China's <strong>Singles Day</strong>, the world's biggest retail event, failed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4686280-b6a7-4569-848a-b410d0d04cc9\">lift the gloom</a> around the country's economy. Consumers and retailers remain nervous about Xi Jinping's zero-Covid policy as well as a crackdown on excess.</p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia </strong>is hoping a 50 per cent increase in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d4654f4-9db5-41a8-b595-dd397a51d29e\">phosphate fertiliser</a> production can help it become less dependent on oil revenues. The kingdom was emboldened at the COP27 conference last week as demand for oil from the west “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/489baf5e-b3b2-40ff-a13c-97ada97f75ef\">exposed hypocrisies</a>” on the use of fossil fuels.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> has started to demand more details from companies on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/403c5cec-c55c-4062-b4b5-d16434225b70\">impact of inflation</a> on their business. Shipping group FedEx and retailer Costco are among those with a letter from the SEC.</p> <p>As the “free money” era comes to an end, <strong>dealmaking</strong> is getting tougher, with overall global activity so far this year down a third on last year. For companies with solid balance sheets, however, the current environment makes it the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f22d5bf3-eefb-40dc-98c3-7a325a45b523\">perfect time to strike</a>. </p> <p>High energy prices are leading UK <strong>hospitality businesses</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df289921-1113-4aba-8016-ae64801b60ed#post-923d5917-a2d7-48de-9942-7324869a2556\">cut working hours</a>. The imminent World Cup, normally a boom for pubs showing live games, is unlikely to provide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/faf57611-65a0-426d-af81-fb23fbdd9c81\">much of a saviour</a> this time around.</p> <p>The head of the world's second-largest <strong>gold miner</strong> said the sector outlook was uncertain but played down fears of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21d20c63-381c-4a97-8a4a-47bb5e75a9b3\">price crash</a>. </p> <p>Unexpectedly downbeat financial forecasts from the likes of Qualcomm, AMD and Intel have highlighted how the US <strong>chipmaking boom</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f310389-781b-4ffa-9393-e841cb0e8450\">turned from boom to bust</a>. China's semiconductor industry meanwhile is still struggling to adapt to new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01bd6d72-1be7-4406-8867-17dff6cf7146\">US export controls</a> that limit its ability to obtain or make advanced chips.</p> <p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> is giving insurers “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3372e1a-d43c-403e-97e5-449b50d51b87\">godlike” powers</a> to make predictions on everything from natural disasters to brain disease, says the head of the company introducing Japan's firsts dementia prevention insurance.</p> <p><em>The FT invited readers to nominate European companies using new technology to meet the business challenges of 2022, from the Ukraine war to the climate crisis.
