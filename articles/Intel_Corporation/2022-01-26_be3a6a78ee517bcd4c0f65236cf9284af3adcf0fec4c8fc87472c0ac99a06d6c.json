  "text": "<p>How are stock index trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 327 points, or 1%, to 33,970.73, after earlier pushing as high as 34,815.67.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX shed 41,95 points, or 0.9%, to 4,315.40.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP lost 106.76 points, or 0.8%, to 13,432.54. Major indexes traded at or near session highs immediately after the Fed announcement.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow industrials fell 66.77 points, or 0.2%, to close at 34,297.73. The index saw a more than 800-point drop at its session low early Tuesday, followed by a rise in the afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 declined 53.68 points, or 1.2%, to end at 4,356.45 after a brief spell in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite&#xa0;dropped 315.83 points, or 2.3%, to finish at 13,539.29.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Stocks lost their grip on earlier gains Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve at its first meeting of 2022 opted not to increase benchmark interest rates yet, but signaled that monetary policy will soon tighten.</p><p>There was no commitment to a move the federal-funds rate higher at the central bank's next meeting in mid-March, but analysts said a move appears all but assured barring an unexpected shock. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said policy makers reached no decisions yet on the path of monetary support.</p><p>Instead, Fed officials will leave it to coming meetings to sort out how to “significantly reduce” the central bank's near $9 trillion balance sheet. That process is slated to start once rate increases have begun.</p><p>See:Fed ‘expects' it will soon be appropriate to raise interest-rates</p><p>“The Fed took a hammer out of its toolbox, and not a sledgehammer,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group, in a phone call. “While we might have some swoons and rallies in markets, I think Powell is playing by the playbook, which is incrementalization.”</p><p>Markets largely expect the Fed's first interest-rate hike will arrive in March. Investors also are eager for a clearer road map to tighter monetary policy, including specifics on how the Fed expects to shrink its near $9 trillion balance sheet.</p><p>“Big picture, we are still positive on the equity market,” said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager&#xa0;at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, in a phone call. “Usually, when the economy is this strong, the market tends to have good results.”</p><p>Powell, in an afternoon news conference, also said the omicron wave “continues to cause great hardship,” particularly for front-line workers, and that the economic outlooks remains “highly uncertain.”</p><p>Stocks have been whipsawed by recent volatility, driven by disappointment over corporate earnings so far this quarter, tension between Russia and NATO over Ukraine, COVID-19 worries and, most of all, apprehension over the Fed's path to fighting inflation pegged at 7%.</p><p>“This meeting matters, because it is the first of the year, and it sets the tone,” said Chris Dhanraj, managing principal of investments at CLA Wealth Advisory, in a phone interview. “The macro view of the world is that rates are rising, and that the Fed and President Biden are going after higher inflation prints.”</p><p>Read:Fed rate hikes loom: These 11 arguments will define ‘titanic' stock-market battle</p><p>Fears over tighter Fed policy have been reflected in the Nasdaq, down 14% this month. It fell into correction territory last week, down more than 10% from its record high in November. Dominated by interest-rate-sensitive growth stocks, the index has suffered blows from rising Treasury yields.</p><p>In other central bank action, the Bank of Canada on Wednesday held its rates steady at 0.25%, but said hikes will be coming this year to help it control high inflation. It also is considering letting maturing government bonds roll off its balance sheet.</p><p>U.S. data released Tuesday showed slippage in consumer confidence, on the back of rising prices and the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>Of the 100 S&amp;P 500 companies to already report fourth-quarter earnings, 17% missed analyst expectations, with 81% beating estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with 84% beating estimates in the past four quarters.</p><p>Investors are sifting through a fresh batch of earnings, with a busy after-hours calendar as well, as Tesla, Intel INTC, Whirlpool WHR and Xilinx XLNX are all due to report.</p><p>The standoff between Russia and Western powers continued, with concerns growing that Moscow is planning an imminent invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government warned Wednesday it would turn to “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands and continue “aggressive” policies.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Texas Instruments Inc. shares TXN rose 1.5% after the chip group's earnings topped Wall Street expectations. </p><p>AT&amp;T Inc.T stock fell 8.8% after the telecommunications giant topped earnings expectations.</p><p>Boeing Co.'s stock BA was last off 5.5% despite the aircraft maker reporting a much bigger-than-expected loss and hefty revenue miss.</p><p>Tesla Inc.TSLA stock edged lower, following a 7.8% drop from a three-day losing streak through Tuesday. Tesla will report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday.</p><p>Mattel Inc.MAT shares rose 3.7% after The Wall Street Journal reported, citing company executives, that the toy maker had won back the rights to produce toys based on film characters from rival Hasbro Inc. HAS. Shares of Hasbro were down 0.4%.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 4.7 basis points to 1.83%.
