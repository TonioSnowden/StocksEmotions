  "title": "Broadcom  Nears Deal  With Cloud  Company  VMware  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>    Broadcom Inc. is in advanced talks to buy VMware Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, setting the stage for what would be one of the year's biggest deals. </p><p>   The technology companies are discussing a cash-and-stock deal that could come soon, assuming the talks don't fall apart, the people said. VMware has a market value of $40 billion, while Broadcom's is around $222 billion. </p><p>   The deal discussions, which picked up pace in recent days, come roughly six months after computing pioneer Dell Technologies Inc. spun off its 81% equity stake in VMware. </p><p>   Bloomberg News earlier reported on the talks. </p><p>   VMware has a strong position in the market for \"hybrid\" cloud, where large companies mix public cloud services like those of Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. with their own private networks. </p><p>   Broadcom, a semiconductor powerhouse built largely through acquisitions, has been on the hunt for a deal to beef up its presence in the corporate-software market. </p><p>   It came close to buying the closely held software company SAS Institute Inc. last year before SAS's founders had a change of heart. </p><p>   Its first big foray into software was its roughly $19 billion acquisition of CA Technologies in 2018. </p><p>   The demand for cloud computing, which enables customers to rent computing horsepower rather than invest in their own, has exploded in recent years. </p><p>   Startups and other businesses that couldn't support in-house IT departments were among the earliest cloud adopters, but now companies across nearly every industry rely on cloud services. </p><p>   Dell completed the spinoff of its VMware stake in November. VMware shareholders, including Dell, got an $11.5 billion cash dividend. Dell used the funds to pay down debt and said the deal positioned it to grow in new markets. </p><p>   Michael Dell, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive, remained chairman of VMware. </p><p>   VMware is roughly a year into a new regime after company veteran Raghu Raghuram took over following the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, who left to run Intel Corp. </p><p>   VMware is set to report earnings Thursday, while Broadcom is set to report earnings next week. </p><p>   A market downturn that has sent stock prices lower has made it harder to strike deals and finance them. </p><p>   Deal volume is down roughly 25% so far this year compared with last year, according to Dealogic. </p><p>   Microsoft Corp.'s roughly $75 billion acquisition of videogame heavyweight Activision Blizzard Inc. registers as the largest of 2022 so far. </p><p></p>",
