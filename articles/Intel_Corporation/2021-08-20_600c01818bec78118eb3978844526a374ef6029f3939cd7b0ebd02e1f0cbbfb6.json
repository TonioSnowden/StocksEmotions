  "title": "Nvidia's Takeover of Arm Raises Competition Concerns, U.K. Regulator Says; U.S. firm's proposed $40 billion deal for British computer-chip designer faces further scrutiny",
  "text": "<p>Nvidia's acquisition of Arm would lead to a realistic prospect of less competition, a stifling of innovation and more expensive or lower-quality products, according to a summary of the regulator's report published Friday. The antitrust concerns were part of a broader report that also addressed national-security concerns, which the government didn't make public.</p><p>U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he was now considering asking the antitrust regulator to conduct a more-thorough investigation of the proposed merger. There is no timetable for that decision. The digital secretary could eventually decide whether to nix the merger or to approve it, with or without conditions.</p><p>An Nvidia spokesman said the company looked forward to addressing the antitrust regulator's \"initial views\" and resolving any concerns from the U.K. government. Nvidia's chief financial officer said earlier this week that while discussions with regulators were taking longer than they had initially expected, the company was confident that the deal would go through.</p><p>Based in Silicon Valley, Nvidia makes chips for videogaming, data centers and other businesses. It is now the largest U.S. semiconductor company by value after overtaking Intel Corp. by that measure. Last year Nvidia proposed buying Arm, a U.K.-based subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank Corp., that designs the basic blueprints for the chips in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.</p><p>Arm's business model has been to license its chip blueprints for modest licensing fees and partner with as many customers as possible. While Nvidia has said it supports keeping this open business model, its competitors have been skeptical.</p><p>The U.K. antitrust regulator said in the report summary published Friday that it received many concerns over the merger from Nvidia's and Arm's customers and competitors. It said that if Nvidia and Arm merged, the combined company would have incentive to restrict access to Arm's products to benefit Nvidia, among other issues.</p><p>The regulator said that Nvidia proposed solutions to address its concerns, but believed that they wouldn't be effective.</p><p>Several Nvidia rivals have raised concerns about the deal. They argue that Arm has been a successful business, becoming a leader in many sectors of chip-design from mobile phones to data centers, in large part by working with different chip-making partners. Having one chip maker buy Arm would jeopardize that role it plays in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com</p><p>The Nvidia-Arm Saga</p><p>* Nvidia's $40 Billion Deal for Arm Faces U.K. National-Security Probe (April 19)</p><p>* Highflying Nvidia's Deal for Arm Signals Loftier Chip Ambition (Sept. 13, 2020)</p><p>* What Are Nvidia and Arm?
