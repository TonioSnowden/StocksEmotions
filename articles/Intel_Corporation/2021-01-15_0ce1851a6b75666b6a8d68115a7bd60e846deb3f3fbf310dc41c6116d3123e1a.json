  "title": "TSMC to Increase Chip Spending --- Capital expenditures to rise to between $25 billion and $28 billion this year",
  "text": "<p>\"It's a monster number,\" said Brett Simpson, partner at London-based technology research firm Arete Research. \"That's a signal about how they think about the economic recovery and also the confidence they have in their long-term growth.\"</p><p>TSMC also reported record quarterly revenue and net profit Thursday, bolstered by high demand from 5G phones as well as the expanding use of electronics required for remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Net profit increased to 142.77 billion New Taiwan dollars, the equivalent of US$5.1 billion, up 23% from a year earlier, and exceeded expectations from analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence for NT$136.69 billion.</p><p>Mr. Simpson said TSMC's announcement on its investment plans may help alleviate concerns about insufficient semiconductor supplies.</p><p>As auto and electronics manufacturers have sought more chips, suppliers have reached the limits on current production capacity, leading some companies to pour money into expansion. TSMC said its emphasis on capital spending will be necessary to capture growth opportunities from major trends such as 5G and more intensive computing hardware.</p><p>As a result of the shortage, consumers could see more expensive or delayed goods such as laptops or cars. A dearth of supply has hamstrung auto makers, which need such parts to power functions from brakes to emissions controls.</p><p>TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said the company expects high-performance computing to overtake smartphones and become the main growth driver for the next several years. While the pandemic has helped boost chip demand, the company expects that to continue through Covid-19 vaccine rollouts in part because customers have started trying to ensure supply security through higher inventory.</p><p>For the current quarter, TSMC said it expects to post between $12.7 billion and $13 billion in revenue. The company's January-March 2020 revenue was $10.3 billion.</p><p>TSMC produces advanced semiconductors for many companies designing chips including Apple, Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Intel Corp. is in talks with TSMC to further outsource production of some of its advanced chips, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Wednesday, Intel said its chief executive, Bob Swan, would be replaced after the company fell behind competitors.</p><p>Another major contract chip maker, U.S.-based Globalfoundries Inc., is doubling its capital investment this year from 2020 to boost capacity, said Mike Hogan, the company's senior vice president overseeing automotive and industrial chip making.</p><p>Last year, TSMC announced plans to open a $12 billion fabrication plant in Arizona. During Thursday's call, Mr. Liu said the company would still target to build it up to that scale, but further progress would depend on economics and local government support.</p><p>The company also plans to continue expanding capacity at its Nanjing plant in eastern China, though the share of revenue from Chinese customers dropped in the fourth quarter. China accounted for 6% of TSMC's revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 22% in the third quarter. In July, TSMC said it would no longer ship wafers to Huawei Technologies Co. after Sept. 14 due to the U.S. trade restrictions that limit use of American semiconductor-production equipment for the Chinese tech giant.</p>",
