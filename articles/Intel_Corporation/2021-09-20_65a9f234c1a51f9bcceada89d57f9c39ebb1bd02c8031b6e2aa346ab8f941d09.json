  "title": "VC Daily: Diverging Deal and Exit Value Could Spell Market Trouble, Preqin Says",
  "text": "<p>Through the first eight months of this year, North American venture funds have logged a combined $238 billion in exits, writes the Preqin senior writer Charlie McGrath. Last year saw $246 billion.</p><p>Through early September, venture capitalists committed $284 billion to startups, which is nearly $100 billion more than for all of 2020. As capital invested into startups continues to rise above exit value, the market could slow down as the value of what one could sell for diverges from capital committed to a startup, Mr. McGrath wrote.</p><p>Between roughly 2013 and midway through 2019, the amount invested into startups was larger than total exit value, according to the post, but they largely moved in tandem. Currently, the two figures are diverging.</p><p>\"Exit activity may still be far above historical norms, but it's cooling off, and meanwhile deal values have escalated sharply, which could catch up with and temper hopes of future outperformance,\" Mr. McGrath wrote.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>New fundraise. Addition LP, a venture firm launched by former Tiger Global Management investor Lee Fixel in 2019, is raising its third fund, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports, citing people familiar with the situation.</p><p>Mr. Fixel had raised one of the largest debut funds in venture capital history when he collected $1.28 billion for Addition One LP last year. He quickly followed with Addition Two LP of the same size, according to a regulatory filing. Mr. Fixel is now raising as much or more for the third fund, the people said. A representative of Addition declined to comment.</p><p>While Addition is a very young firm, it has already seen one of its companies go public. Montevideo, Uruguay-based payments company dLocal, which Addition backed in a financing last year that valued the company at $1.2 billion, went public in June and is now trading at a market capitalization of more than $18 billion.</p><p>Ginkgo Bioworks Goes Public After Closing SPAC Merger</p><p>Shares of synthetic-biology company Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings Inc. rose on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, following the closing of its merger with a blank-check company, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Boston-based Ginkgo on Friday completed a merger with Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp. and started trading under the ticker symbol DNA. Ginkgo shares opened at $11.15 apiece and ended regular trading at $12.18. Ginkgo raised more than $1.6 billion through the transaction, which valued the company at $15 billion.
