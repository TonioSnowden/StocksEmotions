  "text": "<p>   At GlobalFoundries, Mr. Caulfield said the firm plans to invest $1.4 billion to expand capacity at existing facilities this year, and will likely double that next year. Some of his customers have pledged investment capital to secure future capacity, accounting for 30% of the company's capital expenditure this year, he said. Before the pandemic, the number was zero. </p><p>   At Intel, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said the company would make some of its production capacity available to produce chips in particular short supply and needed by auto-component makers. Supply could start improving in six to nine months, Mr. Gelsinger said in an interview. </p><p>    Guy Eristoff, chief strategy officer at Israel-headquartered foundry Tower Semiconductor Ltd., said chip production can be sped up to 3.5 times the usual time in rare cases by sorting production lines so that high-priority chips pass through quickly. Some equipment can be operated for longer before going into preventive maintenance, though this can come at the cost of lower yields. </p><p>   Altogether, these measures mean some chips can be churned out in 30 to 40 days from the usual 120 days, Mr. Eristoff said. But doing so increases overall production times for other chips. The tweaks can at best increase a fab's production capacity by 5% and be sustained for only up to six months. </p><p>   \"There are all sorts of little things you can play with,\" said Mr. Eristoff. \"But without buying more equipment, you cannot, in a sustained manner, run that much more than you are running right now.\" </p><p>   Suppliers are wary that the surge in demand may not last, with panicked buyers increasing order volumes or placing orders with multiple companies. San Jose, Calif.-based Broadcom Inc., one of the world's leading chip companies, is trying to ensure orders coming in reflect actual demand. It recently reminded investors that it doesn't allow customers to cancel chip orders to deter some buyers from making purchase commitments out of fear of shortages. </p><p>   \"We see customers accelerating their bookings for early deliveries and attempting to build buffers and creating the demand-supply imbalance,\" CEO Hock Tan told investors. The company is nearly 90% booked for the year. </p><p>    Auto makers are among the buyers that have felt the shortage most acutely, as cars need more semiconductors than ever before. Electronics made up more than 40% of a car's total cost in 2017, doubling from that in 2007, according to consulting firm Deloitte. </p><p>   Their use is expected to grow, along with costs. German auto-chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it expects the cost of chips in autonomous vehicles to jump to about $1,200 by 2030 from about $170 currently required for \"Level 2\" vehicles, or partly automated cars. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Robert Wall in San Francisco contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
