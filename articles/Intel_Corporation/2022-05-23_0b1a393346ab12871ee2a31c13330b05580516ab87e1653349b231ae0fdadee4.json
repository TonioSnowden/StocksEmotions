  "title": "Nvidia's data-center sales likely to eclipse gaming — that might not be a good thing; Nvidia earnings preview: Data-center sales have overtaken gaming in only one previous quarter, but a drop-off from earlier in the pandemic may be a bigger reason than surging server-chip sales",
  "text": "<p>Analysts expect gaming sales of $3.46 billion. Last quarter, Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, forecast accelerated data-center growth into the first quarter, following a fourth quarter where data-center sales surged 71% year-over year to a record $3.26 billion.</p><p>Read: </p><p>Why semiconductor stocks are 'almost uninvestable' despite record earnings amid a global shortage</p><p>So far, earnings season has shown strong gains for server chips. Intel Corp. INTC doubled down on its full-year outlook as data-center revenue improved 22% to $6 billion, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD posted its first $5 billion-plus quarter and guided for its first $6 billion-plus period. </p><p>Data center makes up a \"low 20s-percent\" of AMD's enterprise, embedded and semi-custom chips unit — which includes data-center and gaming-console revenue. It surged 88% to $2.5 billion from a year ago. Sales will become more transparent as the company will finally start breaking out data-center sales in its own segment.</p><p>While AMD and Nvidia fight for shares in server CPUs, Nvidia dominates in its role as an accelerant for data centers. Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating and a $370 price target on Nvidia, says the chip maker \"dominates Dedicated Accelerator instances with approximately 80% share\" of data-center sales.</p><p>Read:</p><p>The end of one-chip wonders: Why Nvidia, Intel and AMD's valuations have experienced massive upheaval</p><p>Following results from Intel, AMD and others, Evercore analyst C.J. Muse, who has an overweight rating and a $300 price target on Nvidia, said that data-center products are facing \"robust demand trends which are expected to drive very strong growth over the next few quarters.\" Demand, however, has hardly seemed to be a problem; rather, supply difficulties and ever-increasing roadblocks are the issues. </p><p>Investors will be looking for any problems similar to Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, which reported its earnings this past week.Cisco — which has an April-ending quarter like Nvidia — noted that it was broadsided after Chinese authorities locked down Shanghai starting on March 27, and threw a monkey wrench into Cisco's ability to get components. As a result, Cisco issued a poor outlook and shares saw their worst day in more than a decade.</p><p>What to expect</p><p>Earnings: Of 39 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Nvidia on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of $1.30 a share, up from 92 cents a share reported a year ago and the $1.19 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter. All figures are adjusted for last year's 4-for-1 stock split.</p><p>Revenue: Wall Street expects revenue of $8.12 billion from Nvidia, according to 36 analysts polled by FactSet. That's up from the $5.66 billion Nvidia reported in the year-ago quarter and $7.28 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter. In its last earnings report, Nvidia forecast $7.94 billion to $8.26 billion.</p><p>Stock movement: Over Nvidia's first, or April-ending, quarter, shares dropped 25%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX fell 17% over that period. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX shed 8.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP dropped 13%. On Nov. 29, Nvidia's stock closed at an all-time high of $333.76, and has since dropped 50%.</p><p>Nvidia has topped analyst estimates for earnings consistently over the past five years and has beaten Street revenue estimates for 12 consecutive quarters. Shares did fall 7.6% the day after last quarter's report, despite the earnings beat. Generally, the stock's movement has been mixed amid the string of beats.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, who has an outperform rating and a $300 price target, said Nvidia will likely solidify its data-center leadership as its new H100 chip ramps up in the third quarter. </p><p>\"Demand continues to outpace supply, though constraints should ease into 2H,\" Shafer said. \"Nextgen Ada Lovelace performance gaming GPU is expected in 3Q. Our long-term thesis remains intact as NVDA's core leading gaming and AI accelerator franchises remain positioned for outsize structural growth.\"</p><p>Read:</p><p>Chips may be sold out for 2022 thanks to shortage, but investors are worried about the end of the party</p><p>Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson, who has a neutral rating and a $190 price target, said any downside for Nvidia \"is necessarily predominantly tied to gaming revenues.\"</p><p>\"For gaming, falling secondary market prices and improved availability in retail are among the signals that GPU demand is finally slowing,\" Bryson said. \"While such a result makes sense, particularly with the velocity of Ethereum hashing adds declining, the specific impact to Nvidia is hard to quantify given numerous variables.\"</p><p>Read:</p><p>Nvidia seeks to lead gold rush into the metaverse with new AI tools</p><p>Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a positive rating and a $320 price target, agreed in a Wednesday note that \"any significant beat and raise may be capped by gaming headwinds.\"</p><p>\"For gaming, we note the retail premiums above MSRP for Nvidia cards has declined precipitously from a high of +130% in mid-2021 to +78% in January and just 23% today,\" Rolland said. \"Coincident with these price declines, we have also witnessed a significant restocking, with all major card families now available at retailers.\"</p><p>Of the 45 analysts who cover Nvidia, 37 have buy ratings, seven have hold ratings, and one has a sell rating, with the stock trading at 48% of the average price target of $319.95.</p><p>Nvidia's data-center sales likely to eclipse gaming — that might not be a good thing</p>",
