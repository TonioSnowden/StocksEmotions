  "text": "<p>A string of losses last week led the S&amp;P 500 to register its worst weekly performance since February. Thomas Lee, head of research at FundStrat Global Advisors, said investors had been unusually glum amid last week's pullback. But he said this week brings brighter tidings for investors, which should help pull stocks out of their recent ditch, including the start of the first major in-person financial conference, SALT in New York this week, a new consumer confidence report and a possible rollover in Covid-19 cases.</p><p>\"Even if there is technical damage to equities, I am in the camp that we see a strong September rally,\" Mr. Lee said in a note to clients.</p><p>Analysts added that some stocks are also getting a boost from U.S. lawmakers' push this month with a proposed $3.5 trillion legislation for additional spending on healthcare, education and climate.</p><p>On Monday, UnitedHealth Group led the Dow higher, gaining 3% to make it the biggest point contributor to the price-weighted benchmark. Boeing followed, rising 2.2%, Intel Corp. added 2%.</p><p>Energy stocks were among the sectors helping to keep the S&amp;P 500 in positive territory. Oil and gas stocks were up almost 4% in recent trading after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted stronger demand next year amid ongoing oil supply disruptions.</p><p>Energy companiesMarathon Oil, APA andOccidental Petroleum all led the S&amp;P 500, rising at least 6.6% in recent trading. Brent crude, the international benchmark in energy markets, advanced 0.8% to $73.51 a barrel.</p><p>Meme stock GameStop was up 6.1% and AMC Entertainment rose 4.3%. Bitcoin traded below $45,000, slipping 0.7% from its 5 p.m. ET level on Friday. Last week, it rose above $52,500.</p><p>Money managers already have an eye on Tuesday as they wait to assess if fresh data shows that inflation remains elevated, and how that may impact the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 1.320% from 1.340% on Friday.</p><p>The current level of yields is signaling that bond investors see higher inflation levels as transitory, according to Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco.</p><p>\"There is not enough inflationary pressure to really feel a reassessment of nominal growth over the long term,\" she said. \"I do believe that the bulls have a little more ammunition than the bears: fiscal support still remains on tap, activity indicators are strong,\" saidGregory Perdon, chief investment officer ofArbuthnot Latham. \"Risk is still on.\"</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Michael Wursthorn at michael.wursthorn@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Hugs Flatline While Dow Rallies</p>",
