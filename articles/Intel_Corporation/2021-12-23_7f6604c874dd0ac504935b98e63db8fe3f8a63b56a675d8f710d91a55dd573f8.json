  "text": "<p><em>No Bryce tomorrow I'm afraid — this is the last City Bulletin of the year. I'll be back with you on January 4. Whether you're taking a break or trying to get deals done before year-end, I hope you escape infection over the festive period.</em></p> <p><strong>Flutter Entertainment</strong> is having a festive flutter on Italy (sorry). </p> <p>The FTSE 100 gambling group, which owns Paddy Power, Betfair and US sports betting brand FanDuel, is buying Italy's leading online gaming operator <strong>Sisal</strong> for £1.6bn in cash.</p> <p>Sisal, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b516d92-6d1a-4080-b06c-37e4f8416a68\">one of four bidders</a> for the UK National Lottery contract, had been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/sisal-ipo-idUSKBN2GK1I0\">planning to float</a> on the Milan stock exchange early next year. But seven years after abandoning plans for a previous IPO, private equity owner CVC has decided to sell the company instead. </p> <p>Flutter said the acquisition would give it an 20 per cent share of the online gambling market in Italy when combined with its PokerStars and Betfair brands, and would help further diversify its assets. </p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>An activist fight at <strong>Third Point's</strong> London-listed feeder fund appears to have escalated. Third Point Investors Ltd has been battling <strong>Asset Value Investors</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f07a440-2af3-43a5-bb59-c0e470810270\">last month lost a vote</a> to remove Third Point's general counsel from the London fund's board. But instead the activist has claimed the scalp of TPIL's chair, Steve Bates. TPIL said this morning that Bates had “determined that circumstances have rendered his continued service as director of the company untenable”. More soon on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/\">FT.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> has reached a resolution with the US Department of Justice over criminal and civil investigations into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a689ac4-a624-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">performance incentive fees</a> wrongly claimed by one of the company's subsidiaries for work on US military housing between 2013 and 2019. Balfour Beatty will pay just over $65m in total: just under $34m in penalties and $32m in restitution. </p> <p>‘Stratospheric' <strong>gas prices</strong> are creating a ‘national crisis' in the UK, <strong>energy companies</strong> have warned. London-listed Good Energy, EDF and trade body Energy UK became the latest to press for urgent government intervention yesterday, our energy and UK politics correspondents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55fcab59-ef29-4175-8532-a3ec7c7b5f95\">report</a>. </p> <p>And a final fine from yesterday to round out the week: not a bank this time but a <strong>hedge fund</strong>. UK regulators fined former hedge fund <strong>BlueCrest Capital</strong> <strong>Management</strong> more than £40m for “reckless” behaviour in failing to manage a conflict of interest between 2011 and 2015. Hedge funds correspondent Laurence Fletcher <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23ebd6ba-42ed-41fc-bc40-d8ada0e82544\">has more</a>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Tencent </strong>is reducing its stake in JD.com, distributing almost 15 per cent of the shares in the ecommerce group to its shareholders, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8741069-9517-4cc8-ae3b-e585ee6cb5a1#post-c515e11f-3fb7-432c-924f-4d17c82add48\">William Langley reports from Hong Kong</a>. Tencent indirectly owns about 17 per cent of JD.com. Under the plans, that will fall to 2.3 per cent. Tencent president, billionaire Martin Lau, has retired from the JD.com board with immediate effect. </p> <p>Europe's <strong>over-complex bank rules</strong> increase risk, Denmark and Norway's financial supervisors warned in interviews with the FT. There is a wood for the trees problem: the thousands of pages of rules and directives have become so onerous to enforce, they threaten regulators' ability to see the real risks building in their financial systems, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f520bc35-d84f-4ef5-bfa0-c554a25859fc\">Laura Noonan reports</a>. </p> <p>And chipmaker <strong>Intel</strong> has apologised for saying it ensures its supply chain is free of products and labour from <strong>Xinjiang</strong>, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8741069-9517-4cc8-ae3b-e585ee6cb5a1#post-65072ba0-095b-4708-88b6-e552b8e59510\">breaking news team report</a>, making it the latest multinational company to run afoul of tensions between Washington and Beijing over alleged human rights abuses in the Chinese region.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>First up, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24ae0c8d-2d1e-443f-a6ce-184df1b88908\">my column</a> (I'm going to recommend it every week, please read it). This week it's on why disappointing performance from two of <strong>London's tech IPOs</strong> should not overshadow the progress the City has made in attracting growth company listings this year. </p> <p>And my second pick is inspired by my sister-in-law, a former pro cyclist, who is staying with us: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ebbd822-59a7-4696-9119-11ad4a209e9b\">how to get the best</a> from <strong>winter cycling</strong>. </p> <p>Happy holidays, and see you on the other side. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Flutter gambles on Italian growth' FT.com 23 December.
