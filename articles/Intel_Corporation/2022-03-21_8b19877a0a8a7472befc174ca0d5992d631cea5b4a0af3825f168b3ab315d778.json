  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>As FT columnist Rana Foroohar writes today, the war in Ukraine has not only upended countless lives but is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/742d7df6-0d74-424f-81c2-bcd4cbbdbfd0\">upending business models</a> too, further damaging supply chains already weakened by the pandemic.</p> <p>The situation is unprecedented. “The ongoing supply chain disruptions have now lasted longer than the 1973-4 and 1979 oil embargoes — combined,” says Richard Bernstein of the RBA investment firm.</p> <p>Even companies that do little business in the region are recognising the importance of more regional or local production hubs, writes Foroohar, something long recognised by “maker” firms that source locally but which is now being picked up by bigger brands wanting more insurance against any kind of shock, whether political or climate-related.</p> <p>Many larger businesses are looking to vertical integration to smooth disruptions such as those caused by the global <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/763c9e15-44ab-43bc-b3e9-0d03bf27e841\">semiconductor crisis</a>. Intel last week said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f7e4a87-f0c4-469a-b0cf-7bb3570e31f4\">invest €33bn</a> in manufacturing and research in Europe, rising to €80bn by the end of the decade, as well as $40bn to expand chipmaking in the US. The US and Europe are also planning tens of billions in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afbee42b-ba06-49c7-a053-7263e1a4c228\">support for the industry</a> in an attempt to lessen dependence on Asian manufacturers.</p> <p>Food production is another sector being forced into a rethink. The EU was already reviewing its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f99d784c-0448-4552-ab8b-e77ed68ea173\">sustainable food strategy</a> as part of a drive to eliminate carbon emission but now has to contend with a drop in grain and fertiliser exports from Russia and Ukraine, raising concerns over food security.</p> <p>Energy too is in the throes of transformation, as the west, and Europe in particular, race to find alternatives to Russian oil. Germany yesterday said it had made a long-term agreement with Qatar for the supply of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1192517b-e405-486f-a743-51b5be356024\">liquefied natural gas</a>, a deal described by a minister as a “door opener” for the German economy, while in the UK, Shell has submitted revised plans for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3664e3e8-d48e-4dba-b674-f0f469dba227\">North Sea gasfield</a> originally rejected by the country's regulator.</p> <p>As well as reshaping traditional business practices, the conflict has also boosted nascent sectors such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3778d00-4c9b-40bb-b91c-84b60dd09698\">cryptocurrency</a> systems, adopted enthusiastically by the Ukraine government as a speedy way of raising donations as well as paying for military equipment.</p> <p>Another beneficiary of disrupted supply chains cited by Foroohar is 3D printing, which gained ground during the pandemic to locally manufacture everything from PPE to emergency housing.</p> <p>“Even in times of war, decoupling and geopolitical fear, it's worth remembering that there is opportunity in crisis,” she concludes. </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>UN migration agency says almost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNmigration/status/1505921604332789760\">6.5mn people</a> displaced inside Ukraine due to war </p></li>  <li><p>Moscow takes first steps towards <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0390917-41e2-4f31-b355-6f73759e5782\">reopening financial markets</a></p></li>  <li><p>Russian court rules Facebook and Instagram <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fe601c9-25e2-48e5-a668-d4fcb34d3afc#post-1f429103-a3f0-4ba2-b8c4-ffdb69b4fd01\">‘extremist'</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fe601c9-25e2-48e5-a668-d4fcb34d3afc\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is being urged to address the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f52f790f-d3d9-4f7f-b6d7-760d9643b8bd\">cost of living crisis</a> in his Spring Statement, but chief economics commentator Martin Wolf says he must also explore opportunities for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7486d44c-3b4f-4e9f-9e78-4025f74d4ce4\">lasting reform</a>.

Suggestions include allowing the use of alternative products and a relaxation of regulation. <strong>Fertiliser prices</strong> today hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fe601c9-25e2-48e5-a668-d4fcb34d3afc#post-c82f9ac4-43fc-4020-b9a0-bda9bf0bd14f\">new record</a>.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>The Ukraine crisis has led to <strong>food shortages</strong> in Arab countries as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b76d3414-4f11-4e46-9271-9309c06237df\">wheat prices soar</a>. Grains and vegetable oil from Ukraine and Russia are crucial to national diets across the region and the UN has warned the situation “could cause an escalation of hunger and poverty with dire implications for global stability”. <strong>Egypt</strong> today <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fe601c9-25e2-48e5-a668-d4fcb34d3afc#post-8a8e986a-942d-4e9f-aa24-e8c0977046a3\">devalued its currency</a> and raised interest rates in an attempt to contain the impact of the war. </p> <p>Businesses in <strong>Hong Kong </strong>welcomed the relaxation of some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c8e74fb-7602-49da-9ee5-0e5ecc8dac52\">quarantine and flight restrictions</a>, including from the US and UK. “The measures are the sign we have all been waiting for,” said the chair of the European Chamber of Commerce, but added: “The decision comes at an almost too late stage . . . We need to see the recovery plan to avoid further damage, as the damage has already happened big time.” <strong>Mainland China</strong> is still grappling with the problem of mass infections and millions of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91e91ac6-6264-468b-8c7f-bd7c53a37ecf\">unvaccinated elderly</a>.</p> <p>Influential investor <strong>Bill Gross</strong> told the FT that the Federal Reserve's plan for rate rises would “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab01f85-bcc3-4dd7-b2ff-31195425be43\">crack the US economy</a>”.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>“<strong>Grand Theft Aero</strong>” was how one observer described Moscow's move to allow foreign jets to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61a2daab-2251-4a8b-8960-f69fde1f5642\">re-registered in Russia</a>, thwarting efforts by global leasing groups to recover more than 500 aircraft, worth an estimated $10bn, that were stuck in the country.</p> <p>Grand corporate statements about <strong>exiting Russia</strong> are easy to make but complicated to carry out. FT reporters look at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86144c9c-2258-4b9c-a0ad-ea8d63b7000f\">key questions facing multinationals</a>. <strong>Nestlé</strong> was forced to defend its decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1484606c-3e8f-494e-9e88-528a79aeeeaa\">stay in Russia</a> as Ukraine's president increased the pressure on the world's biggest food company to withdraw, citing the incongruity of its slogan “good food, good life”. </p> <p>The latest in our <strong>Charts that Matter</strong> series shows the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53db5df0-91d8-4676-9b95-c254ffe1b5f9\">level of fear</a> in markets, as measured by the Cboe Vix index, starting to return to normal after violent swings caused by the invasion of Ukraine and ahead of the Federal Reserve's first rate rise since 2018.</p> <p>The UK <strong>hospitality</strong> and <strong>leisure</strong> sectors are particularly at risk from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf3c02c1-cb06-44b0-815d-6efdb6b4c941\">soaring energy prices</a>, with energy-intensive gyms and leisure centres with swimming pools “now at major risk of closure”. The next few weeks are critical as a large number of bespoke contracts signed with energy suppliers come to an end in April, in line with the end of the UK's financial year.</p> <p>From selling drinks without bottles to niche food start-ups, young companies have been busily responding to the pandemic-driven shift in the way people work, live, shop and communicate.

We could however be set for the <strong>Great Return</strong>, says the FT Lex column, as falling stock markets and higher living costs force retirees to return.
