  "title": "U.S. News:  U.S. Joins Global Push to Subsidize Chip-Making Production  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn",
  "text": "<p>   A mega-spending package to boost U.S. semiconductor production must reckon with a tough reality: The world is already awash in chip-making incentives. </p><p>   What makes the U.S. effort unique is the enormous one-time sum -- roughly $77 billion in subsidies and tax credits -- earmarked to boost American manufacturing of the ubiquitous tech component. But other countries, especially in Asia, have doled out government money and offered favorable regulations for decades. And they plan for more. </p><p>   China has prepared investments of more than $150 billion through 2030, according to one estimate. South Korea, with an aggressive array of incentives, aims to encourage roughly $260 billion in chip investments over the next five years. The European Union is pursuing more than $40 billion in public and private semiconductor investments. Japan is spending about $6 billion to double its domestic chip revenue by the end of the decade. </p><p>   Taiwan has around 150 government-sponsored projects for chip production over the past decade, with its leader pushing for more localized manufacturing of semiconductor equipment. Singapore landed a $5 billion chip factory earlier this year from United Microelectronics Corp., which said it had been drawn by the city-state's vision to attract high-tech firms. </p><p>   \"We are in a race to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing,\" said Peter Hanbury, a partner with expertise in tech supply chains at Bain &amp; Co., a management consulting firm. Countries must compete over a limited number of chip makers that have relatively finite needs for new production sites, plus expand engineering talent, stable infrastructure and supply chains, he said. </p><p>   Semiconductors go into just about every electronic device and are critical to a range of major industries from smartphones and cars to military equipment and healthcare devices. The recent chip shortage that rattled supply chains underscored how swaths of the world economy can be shut down -- and related jobs lost -- in the absence of these tiny tech components. </p><p>   With the federal incentives now available, a key question will be to what extent the U.S. is able to land major chip-factory investments that would have gone elsewhere. The chip industry is notoriously conservative on capital-expenditure spending, given that the most advanced facilities require tens of billions of dollars -- and a single machine costs more than $150 million. </p><p>   Many countries have outlined lofty ambitions to become bigger players in global chip production. However, only a handful of chip-production giants have the financial wherewithal to greenlight billion-dollar investments and cash in on government incentives that lower construction costs and operational expenses as well as research and hiring. </p><p>   The U.S. is expected to coordinate with other major chip-making countries that are allies to avoid a subsidy competition that could lead to production overruns or overlapping government investments, said Will Hunt, a research analyst specializing in semiconductor policies at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. </p><p>   The new U.S. incentives, which cleared Congress after a House vote on Thursday, will help reduce the significantly higher price tag of placing an advanced chip factory on American soil, say industry executives, lawmakers and semiconductor analysts. </p><p>   The absence of U.S. subsidies prompted American chip maker Intel Corp. in June to say it would delay the groundbreaking ceremony of a new $20 billion chip-making plant in Ohio unless Congress passed the subsidy bill. \"Support of federal funding to level the playing field and make this investment competitive is critical,\" said Bruce Andrews, Intel's chief government affairs officer, in a March commentary posted on the company's website. </p><p></p>",
