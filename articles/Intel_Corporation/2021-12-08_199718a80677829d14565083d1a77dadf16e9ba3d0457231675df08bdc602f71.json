  "text": "<p>Roku ROKU and Alphabet's GOOGGOOGL Google had been in heated negotiations about the future of YouTube and YouTube TV on the Roku platform. Roku had pulled the YouTube TV app from its channel store back in April after the companies failed to agree on terms for the online-cable service, but now they appear to be on better footing.</p><p>The two companies have “agreed to a multi-year extension for both YouTube and YouTube TV,” a Roku spokesperson said Wednesday. The arrangement is “a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” the spokesperson continued.</p><p>Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</p><p>Roku's stock was up more than 18% in Wednesday afternoon trading and on track to log its largest single-day percentage gain since Aug. 8, 2019, when it added 20.9%. Shares of Alphabet were near flat.</p><p>Subscribe:&#xa0;Want intel on all the news moving markets?
