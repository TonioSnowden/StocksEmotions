The S&amp;P 500 index SPX closed up 1.4% to 4,577.10, its best day since Oct. 14. The Nasdaq Composite COMP added 0.8% to 15,381.32. All three indexes are reflecting a loss of under 1% for the week thus far.</p><p>The Russell 2000 index RUT gained 2.7% to finish at 2,206.33, a day after hitting its first correction since June 2020.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>After several days of volatile action, major indexes logged positive closes for the first time in three sessions on Thursday. Gains were driven by hopes that the omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will prove less deadly, even if more transmissible, and less disruptive for the global economy.</p><p>Investors learned of a second U.S. case of the omicron variant from a Minnesota resident visiting New York, who reportedly showed mild symptoms.</p><p>The U.S. economy swings squarely into focus on Friday, with November nonfarm payrolls that are expected to show 573,000 new jobs created, up slightly from 531,000 the prior month, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Those numbers are due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, alongside the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings.</p><p>The data have become even more important after the Fed's Powell this week spoke of a strong economy and the prospect of a quicker taper, which could speed up interest-rate hikes.</p><p>“If the virus news ticker stays quiet, a higher U.S. nonfarm payrolls print could see equity gains capped, with a slightly lower or on target print of 550K, not enough to entirely remove faster Fed-taper fears,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note to clients.</p><p>Want Intel on all the news moving markets?

And, that remains a major downside risk to the risky assets,” said Ozkardeskaya.</p><p>Shares of Chinese companies may be in focus on Friday, after Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global DIDI said late Thursday it will delist from the New York Stock Exchange, following pressure from the Chinese government. Shares of Didi rose 9% in premarket trading.</p><p>Among other assets, oil prices continued to rise, with West Texas Intermedicate crude CL00 up 2.5% to $68.14 a barrel, and global benchmark Brent BRN00 rising 2.3% to $71.28 a barrel.</p><p>On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, together known as OPEC+, decided to rollover their existing production policy and boost output at the start of next year, even amid concerns the omicron variant could hurt demand.</p>",
