  "text": "<p>GlobalFoundries Inc. swung to a third-quarter profit and its revenue rose 56%, driven by strong demand amid a chip shortage.</p><p>The contract chip maker, one of the world's largest chip makers and Ford Motor Co.'s semiconductor partner, reported a $5 million profit for the September quarter, compared with a $293 million loss a year earlier. On a per share basis, the profit was one penny, or 7 cents on an adjusted basis.</p><p>Net revenue rose to $1.7 billion from $1.09 billion a year earlier.</p><p>The results were in line with GlobalFoundries projections, while analysts surveyed by FactSet expected the company to report a loss and $1.7 billion in revenue.</p><p>On Tuesday, company officials said the industry has somewhat closed the supply-demand gap but was nowhere close to where it needs to be.</p><p>The financial report was the company's first as a public company, which started trading publicly in October. GlobalFoundries, the former chip-manufacturing unit of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., remains controlled by Mubadala Investment Co., an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government.</p><p>The company's customers include the U.S. Department of Defense and companies such as Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc., AMD and Broadcom Inc.</p><p>The company's stock, which priced at $47 in the initial public offering, has since hit a high of $73.25. The stock closed Tuesday at $69.24.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in July that GlobalFoundries was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corp. while preparing for the IPO. Company officials said there were no talks with Intel.</p><p>This quarter, which would cover the period of the IPO, GlobalFoundries expects profit to range from $13 million to $33 million and revenue from $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion.</p><p>Analysts expect a profit of about $15 million and about $1.8 billion in revenue.</p><p>The U.S.-based company has pointed to expansion opportunities, as countries like the U.S. increase investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing on economic and national-security grounds. Currently, foundry production is largely concentrated in China and Taiwan.</p><p>Company officials said most of the money raised in the IPO would go toward expansion plans to help meet customer demand.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p><p>GlobalFoundries Says Revenue Rose 56% as Chip Shortage Continues</p>",
