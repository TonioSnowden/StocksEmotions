  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA retreated 313 points, or 0.9%, to 35,660.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 0.6%, or 30 points, to 4,682, losing grip on a psychologically significant level at 4,700.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was trading 0.9%, or 147 points, lower at 15,484.</p><p>Last week, each of the major indexes rose about 4%, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its 67th record high of 2021 on Friday. The benchmark U.S. index has gained 25% this year.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Markets were trading solidly lower Monday as investors sold energy, consumer discretionary and financial shares, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's final gathering of 2021 set for later this week.</p><p>Last Friday's inflation reading helped to highlight rising pricing pressures in America, even if the core reading of inflation was showing some signs of receding. The headline figure from Friday's inflation report showed that the main index reached a 39-year high on a year-over-year basis, but there was relief that it was still below some traders' worst-case scenario.</p><p>Investors are anticipating that Federal Reserve policy makers will announce a faster pace of tapering on Wednesday in response to rising prices, and analysts expect officials will pencil in enough rate hikes to take their main policy rate target to 2.5% by the end of 2024.</p><p>Read:Highest U.S. inflation in nearly 40 years will force Federal Reserve's hand“While investors might interpret the reversal of Fed policy as a bad harbinger, history shows that stock returns remain robust in the months leading up to and following the first rate increase,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist for Credit Suisse Securities.“Over the past 4 cycles ('94, '99, '04, '15), the S&amp;P 500 gained 9.5% in the twelve months prior to the first hike, and 26.0% over the subsequent 3 years,” Golub wrote in a note Monday. “The real damage from higher rates tends to occur later in the cycle when tighter policy flattens/inverts the curve. We are far from that point.”</p><p>Besides the week's flurry of central bank decisions, which also will include the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, markets also will be focused on coronavirus headlines.
