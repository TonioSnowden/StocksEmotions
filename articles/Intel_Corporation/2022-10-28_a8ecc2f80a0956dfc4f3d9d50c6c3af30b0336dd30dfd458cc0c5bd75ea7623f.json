Gross margins dropped to 45.9% from 58.3% in the year-ago period.</p><p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated earnings of 34 cents a share on revenue of $15.31 billion, based on Intel's forecast of 35 cents a share on about $15 billion to $16 billion.</p><p>Breaking down divisions: Client-computing sales fell 17% to $8.1 billion from a year ago, while data-center and AI group sales dropped 27% to $4.2 billion, \"network and edge\" sales rose 14% to $2.3 billion, and Mobileye sales rose 38% to $450 million.
