  "title": "Potential Western Digital-Kioxia Deal Has Chip Investors Salivating; Favorable market reaction across the industry shows how much appetite remains for consolidation in memory-chip business",
  "text": "<p>An all-stock deal probably means dilution of existing Western Digital shareholders, but they may also be relieved that the company doesn't need to take on tons of debt for the acquisition. Even after Wednesday's jump, Western Digital's market value is only slightly higher than $20 billion.</p><p>Investors are probably looking forward to a more consolidated market for NAND memory chips, used for storage. If the deal goes through, that means the number of major players in the NAND market will go to four, from six just last year. Korea's SK Hynix said in October that it would spend $9 billion to buy Intel's NAND flash-memory business.</p><p>Kioxia and Western Digital operate manufacturing facilities in Japan together through their joint venture, so they already enjoy the benefit of scale and share the fixed costs of research and capital expenditure. But a formal combination may still give them better pricing power. The two combined had 34% of the NAND market in 2020, slightly ahead of Samsung's 32.6%, according to market-research firm TrendForce. That may also mean more disciplined supply in the market. The market for DRAM, memory chips used for processing, has three major players—Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron—after years of consolidation.</p><p>A deal valuing Kioxia at more than $20 billion should also be attractive to its owners. A consortium led by Bain Capital bought the company for $18 billion in 2018. Kioxia failed to list at a valuation of $16 billion in September. The company is planning for an initial public offering again, which may be an attractive option, given the owners could get cash rather than shares, but it may not fetch a better price.</p><p>Regulators are one potential obstacle. Bain's takeover of Kioxia in 2018 was structured so that Japanese companies still own slightly more than half of the company. Western Digital has a long-running partnership with Kioxia, but Japanese regulators may still hesitate to give control of semiconductor assets to foreign companies. Regulators in China could be another hurdle. They have imposed conditions on some recent semiconductor deals, and they are the only regulators that haven't approved the SK Hynix-Intel deal.</p><p>Further consolidation in the flash-memory industry has been a long time coming. But agreeing on a price is just the beginning: Getting regulators' nod will be the real test.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Potential Western Digital-Kioxia Deal Has Chip Investors Salivating</p>",
