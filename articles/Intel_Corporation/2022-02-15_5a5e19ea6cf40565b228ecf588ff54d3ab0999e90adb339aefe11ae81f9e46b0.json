  "title": "California Home With Minigolf Hits the Market for $125 Million; The Malibu beachfront home is owned by videogame designer Jonathan Burton",
  "text": "<p>The sellers are British videogame designer Jonathan Burton, 52, and his ex-wife, Helen Musk, 45. The couple bought the property for $36.5 million in 2012 from the estate of Max Palevsky, a computer-technology pioneer, records show. Mr. Palevsky, who helped fund Intel at its founding and was a noted art collector, built the Spanish-style house in the 1970s. He later commissioned Italian architect Ettore Sottsass to renovate the interior, which has arched doorways and beamed ceilings, according to the book \"Three California Houses: The Homes of Max Palevsky.\"</p><p>Mr. Burton founded U.K.-based TT Games and is now CEO of 10:10 Games. He and Ms. Musk spent several million dollars renovating, Ms. Laughlin said, opening up walls and adding windows to ensure ocean views from almost every room. To reach the main residence, visitors pass through two sets of gates: one to access the guesthouse, tennis court and golf area, and another for the primary residence and pool.</p><p>The main residence has a courtyard, said Ms. Laughlin, as well as expansive decks and covered patio areas. Upstairs, the primary bedroom suite has a balcony with ocean views, a sitting area and two offices. The house has five additional en suite bedrooms, and a 14-seat media room with a row of D-BOX seats that move along with the action on screen. \"You feel like you're part of the movie,\" Ms. Laughlin said.</p><p>In addition to the main house, the property has a two-bedroom guesthouse where Ms. Laughlin, a friend of the owners, has lived for the past eight years.</p><p>Ms. Laughlin said the infinity pool has fountains that shoot water into the air. Between the house and beach, there is a landscaped area with Redwood, Eucalyptus and citrus trees as well as a rose garden. Beach access is via a set of stairs, with a small observatory about halfway down the bluff.</p><p>Ms. Laughlin said Mr. Burton and Ms. Musk decided to sell because they are now empty-nesters. Ms. Musk has been living in the home, while Mr. Burton has another home in the area, she said. Now that their children are in college, Ms. Musk plans to move as well.</p><p>Over the past few years, Malibu's luxury market has exploded, resulting in a string of big-ticket deals, Ms. Laughlin said. Last year, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, paid $177 million for a compound less than a mile away, The Wall Street Journal reported. In 2019, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum paid $100 million for a property on Pacific Coast Highway; he paid another $87 million for a neighboring mansion last year.</p><p>Metro Networks founder David Saperstein is currently looking to sell his Malibu home, which was first listed for $115 million. It is now priced at $85 million, according to Zillow.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you want to buy a property with a miniature golf course?
