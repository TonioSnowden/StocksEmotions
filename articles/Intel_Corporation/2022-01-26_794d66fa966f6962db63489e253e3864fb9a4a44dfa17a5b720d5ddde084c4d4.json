  "text": "<p>BRUSSELSâ€”Intel Corp. won an annulment of a $1.2 billion fine issued by the European Union's antitrust regulator more than a decade ago over allegations the microchip producer had used its commercial power to squeeze outa competitor.</p><p>The court's decision is a blow to the European Commission, the bloc's main antitrust regulator, which is seeking to expand its reach through new regulations and a reinterpretation of its existing powers. Lawyers said a ruling in favor of Intel could put a greater burden on the commission in pursuing some antitrust cases.</p><p>The EU's General Court in Luxembourg on Wednesday struck down much of a 2009 finding by the regulator that Intel had abused its dominant position by issuing loyalty rebates and payments that restricted rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from competing.</p><p>The court said that \"analysis carried out by the commission is incomplete\" and didn't make it possible to establish a requisite legal standard for judging the competitive impact of rebates. Significantly, the court said it couldn't identify the damages linked to Intel's practices and so completely annulled the portion of the commission's decision that imposed the fine.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook on Intel for 2022? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A central question for the court was whether the commission had completed a sufficient economic analysis to show that Intel's alleged behavior actually harmed competition. Although the commission carried out an economic analysis of the case before imposing its fine, that work wasn't assessed by the General Court when it dismissed Intel's initial appeal in 2014.</p><p>Intel appealed to the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, which in 2017 sent the case back to the lower court, saying it should have examined the commission's assessment of whether the company's rebates shut out competitors.</p><p>Write to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com and Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Wins EU Antitrust Appeal as Court Annuls $1.2 Billion Fine</p>",
