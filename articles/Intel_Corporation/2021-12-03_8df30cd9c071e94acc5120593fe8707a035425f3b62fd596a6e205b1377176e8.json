  "text": "<p>Joachim Klement, strategist at U.K. broker Liberum, looked at the performance of PE-backed IPOs. It turns out they outperform — both on the first day of trading, when they see gains of 27% vs 13%, and on a three-year buy and hold basis, at 30% vs. 21%. Klement cited University of Florida data between 1980 and 2019.</p><p>“In short, leave the private equity companies alone. They know what they are doing when exiting an investment and they live and let live,” says Klement.</p><p>The FTSE 100 UK:UKX edged up 0.2% in midday trade. BP UK:BP shares rose 2% as Deutsche Bank upgraded the oil giant to buy from hold with a 26% increase in price target. The same bank lifted its Royal Dutch Shell UK:RDSB price target by 9%, as it said the decline in oil prices is an overreaction to the omicron variant news.</p><p>“Crude inventories remain below 5 year averages, extreme upstream capex discipline persists, several OPEC members are already struggling to meet their quotas, a return of Iranian volumes is nowhere in sight, underlying global oil demand has clearly been undented by 18 months of Covid and the threat of EVs remains a post 2030 issue at the earliest,” the analysts said.</p><p>Want intel on all the news moving markets before the day starts?
