  "text": "<p>\n  JAY LAST </p><p>\n  1929-2021 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Jay Last, a founder of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. in 1957, figured out ways to manufacture integrated circuits in bulk, helping to put the silicon into Silicon Valley and make the region a synonym for digital technology. </p><p>\n  Dr. Last, the son of a steelworker from Butler, Pa., started out with a more modest career goal: to parlay his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology into an interesting job that would let him live in California. </p><p>\n  After graduating from MIT in 1956, he joined the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory near San Francisco, run by William Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize the same year for research on transistors and semiconductors. A year later, Dr. Last was one of eight people who bolted from Shockley to found Fairchild Semiconductor. The others included Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, later co-founders of Intel Corp., and Eugene Kleiner, who went on to help form the venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins. </p><p>\n  When Fairchild Semiconductor was formed, transistors were typically produced one at a time out of germanium. \"We felt that the future lay with silicon,\" Dr. Last wrote later. His team developed mass-production processes for silicon chips, which initially went into military hardware and spacecraft and later made possible low-cost calculators, computers and myriad other electronic devices. </p><p>\n  Dr. Last died Nov. 11 in Los Angeles. He was 92. </p><p></p>",
