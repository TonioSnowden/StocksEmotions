  "text": "<p>Samsung Electronics shares leapt on hopes that it could pick up new orders from US rival Intel, in a development that could provide a boost to the South Korean tech group's chipmaking division. </p> <p>Shares in Samsung jumped nearly 10 per cent in morning trading in Seoul on Monday after Bloomberg had earlier <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production?sref=PhB3liAe\">reported</a> that Intel held talks with the Korean company and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co over outsourcing production for some of its processor chips.</p> <p>The reported discussions put a spotlight on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85ebfa62-a2f8-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d\">fierce rivalry</a> between TSMC and Samsung, the biggest and most important companies in Taiwan and South Korea, respectively.</p> <p>Samsung, the world's biggest producer of memory chips, has been on the hunt for big contracts for its foundry unit — which makes processor chips for other companies — as it competes with Taipei-listed TSMC.</p> <p>Intel said last July it was considering outsourcing more of its chip manufacturing after it&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">delayed</a> by six months the launch&#xa0;of some of its next generation processors.</p> <p>Shares in Samsung trimmed early gains and were 4 per cent higher by afternoon trading as chip-sector analysts noted that TSMC looked better placed to win the majority of any potential Intel orders. TSMC shares were little changed. </p> <p>Bernstein analysts estimated Intel might outsource between 10-30 per cent of its central processing unit, or CPU, production in 2023, in a move that would boost TSMC's revenues by 5-10 per cent.</p> <p>“Samsung may get . . . a minor share in this business.&#xa0;Samsung is a viable choice too, but TSMC should get the major share because TSMC's technology is ahead of Samsung's in the next few years, with better execution,” the Bernstein analysts said. </p> <p>TSMC has long been the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a002a9e4-1a42-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3\">favoured manufacturer</a> of CPU chips for consumer electronics groups such as Apple and Huawei. These companies compete directly with Samsung in other markets, such as smartphones and other devices. </p> <p>The Taiwanese group, which pioneered the independent chip foundry model, has dominated the market for decades and maintains long-term relationships with chip designers as well as device makers — arrangements that Samsung has found hard to crack. </p> <p>But the Seoul-headquartered group is pouring $116bn into its foundry division over the next 10 years, in a long-term bid to overtake TSMC.</p> <p>Samsung declined to comment. </p> <p>Separately on Monday, shares in South Korea's biggest carmaker Hyundai Motor were up more than 8 per cent. That builds on a gain of 20 per cent on Friday following reports of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40cfd599-b2f6-469d-923f-9015e9cc46ab\">early stage talks</a> on a car manufacturing venture with Apple.</p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2021 'Samsung shares jump on hopes for Intel chipmaking contract' FT.com 11 January.
