  "title": "As AMD wrestles with PC weakness, 2023 is becoming 'throwaway year' for the chip maker, says analyst",
  "text": "<p>Despite the PC challenges, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree highlighted the server trend as a big win for AMD. The analyst pointed to the company's data-center revenue, which was up 45% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.</p><p>\"AMD appears to be continuing to gain share in this most important segment as Intel's INTC Data Center business declined 10% sequentially and 27% annually, and is expected to face continued headwinds in the December quarter, even while AMD expects sequential and annual growth in the Data Center market in the fourth quarter,\" he wrote, in a note released on Wednesday.</p><p>The analyst firm reiterated its buy rating for AMD but lowered its price target to $85 from $95.</p><p>See Now: AMD stock pops as forecast quells fears about data-center sales, excess inventory</p><p>AMD is also expected to strengthen its position in data centers with the launch of its new Genoa server chip on Nov. 10.</p><p>Mizuho Securities reiterated its buy rating for AMD in a note released late on Tuesday, but lowered its price target to $95 from $102. Analyst Vijay Rakesh sees positives in the chip maker's data center business and the ramp up of the Genoa chip in the first half of 2023, but notes that the PC market is yet to bottom.</p><p>This sentiment is echoed by Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who believes that 2023 is quickly turning into a \"throwaway year\" for AMD as it works through PC industry issues. \"AMD posted 3Q results that were generally in-line with their negative preannouncement but offered significantly worse 4Q guidance, hopefully clearing the decks for 2024,\" he wrote, in a note released late Tuesday. For AMD, 2023 is about working through its PC inventory and ramping up sales efforts around its new Genoa chip, before the company can return to growth in 2024, according to Rolland.</p><p>Susquehanna reiterated its positive rating and $80 price target for AMD.</p><p>However, following the conference call to discuss AMD's results, Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said in a note late Tuesday that he doesn't think the data-center market is as strong as the company believes it to be.</p><p>Read: Meta spending slams Facebook stock, but here are the chip stocks that are benefiting</p><p>\"While we believe AMD will continue to gain market share in the data center market through 2023, we believe AMD share gains will be less meaningful as our checks indicate AMD already has a very high share in the cloud market,\" said Chan, who has a hold rating on the stock. \"Furthermore, our industry checks indicate that Intel's server CPU offerings remain very competitive in the enterprise and service provider markets.\"</p><p>Understandably, AMD's inventory of PC chips remains firmly in the spotlight. Late Tuesday, the chip maker assured analysts it expects to clear excess inventory by the end of the year, that those charges are included in its outlook, and that data-center sales will continue to grow.</p><p>At the worst end of its estimate range, with another quarter of expected poor PC sales, AMD forecast full year sales that were, at worst, about $1 billion short of the Wall Street consensus at the time, following a third quarter where it had shaved $1 billion off expected PC sales.</p><p>In comments to analysts on the conference call following earnings, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su explained that AMD's positioning will allow the company to exit 2022 bloodied but unbowed.</p><p>So far in 2022, the chip sector has had to weather a two-year-old pandemic-triggered parts shortage quickly flip into a glut, causing capacity buildouts across the board to screech to a halt, as PC shipments declined at their worst rate ever recorded, demand for consumer electronics and smartphones decreased, China COVID-19 shutdowns caused more supply-chain havoc, and a widened U.S. restriction on advanced chip technology to China caused many to issue profit warnings.</p><p>Intel earnings reaction:  'Shock and awe' cost cuts rocket Intel stock up 10% to best day since March 2020</p><p>With PC weakness a given, Su told analysts the outlook included costs for clearing out its excess inventory by the end of the fourth quarter, and assured them \"we'll certainly exit the year in a better place.\"</p><p>With regards to China restrictions, Su said the majority of China business, which makes up a quarter of revenue, is \"non-data-center.\"</p><p>\"So, it is more in the PC business as well as in some of the consumer facing businesses,\" Su told analysts on the conference call following the earnings release.</p><p>Of the 43 analysts polled by FactSet, 29 have buy-grade ratings, and 14 have hold ratings on AMD. Of those, no less than 22 analysts lowered their price targets for the stock after the results, to knock the average price target down to $89.24 from a previous $92.68.</p><p>AMD has two upcoming events where it will announce new gaming chips on Thursday, and then new data-center chips the following Thursday.</p><p>At Tuesday's close, AMD shares were down 58% year to date. By comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX is down about 39%, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down 19%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has fallen 30%.</p><p>As AMD wrestles with PC weakness, 2023 is becoming 'throwaway year' for the chip maker, says analyst</p>",
