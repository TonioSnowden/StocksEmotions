  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration completed rules that would speed up federal procurement policies to require a higher level of American-made products. </p><p>   The new requirements, which President Biden highlighted during an event at the White House on Friday, will mean that products obtained under the \"Buy American\" program will need to have at least 60% of the value of components made in the U.S., up from the current threshold of 55%. The rules will increase that standard to 65% in 2024 and 75% by 2029, the White House said. </p><p>   Business groups criticized the rule changes when they were first announced in July, saying that mandated increases would be inefficient and costly. </p><p>   At the White House event Friday, Siemens USA announced plans to invest $54 million to manufacture components and equipment used in electric-vehicle charging stations and data centers, which it says will lead to the hiring of 300 workers in California and Texas. Mr. Biden was joined at the announcement by Barbara Humpton, president and chief executive of Siemens USA. </p><p>   The rules come amid the president's push to increase manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Administration officials point to the more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs added since Mr. Biden took office. </p><p>   During Tuesday's State of the Union address, Mr. Biden said Intel Corp. plans to invest at least $20 billion in new chip-making capacity near Columbus, Ohio, bolstering its semiconductor-production ambitions. </p><p></p>",
