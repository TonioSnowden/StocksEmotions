  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- President Biden called for a bipartisan push to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry during a meeting with auto and tech executives that he used to pitch his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. </p><p>   \"China and the rest of the world is not waiting. And there's no reason why Americans should wait,\" Mr. Biden said Monday. \"We're investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries.\" </p><p>   Mr. Biden spoke during a meeting between top administration officials and senior executives of Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Intel Corp., Alphabet Inc. and others to address the global chip shortage that has led to production slowdowns with auto manufacturing and other industries. The executives appeared via video. </p><p>   The White House signaled that no announcements or decisions were expected, characterizing the meeting as part of ongoing engagement to address the problem. </p><p>   After the meeting, the White House said participants emphasized the need to better track the semiconductor supply chain to help mitigate shortages. Transparency was a topic of discussion, according to a person familiar with the matter. Auto makers are seeking better insight from chip makers on how many will be available. Chip manufacturers want a clearer picture of demand, hoping to avoid prospective ghost orders that can be canceled. </p><p></p>",
