  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ford's collaboration with GlobalFoundries is likely the first of many between the semiconductor industry and car companies intent on tailing Tesla. Just don't expect Detroit to actually make microchips. </p><p>\n  Ford and GlobalFoundries on Thursday announced an early-stage agreement to work together to address two distinct problems facing car manufacturers. Most visibly, lack of semiconductor supplies has led to a sharp decline in global vehicle production and inventories on dealer lots. Longer term, the growth of electric vehicles and the software required to operate them will take demand for automotive chips into a new league. </p><p>\n  \"Strategic collaboration,\" as the companies called it, can't do much to alleviate the immediate chip shortage. The only lasting solution to that is extra chip-manufacturing capacity, which is being built out by GlobalFoundries and others but will take time to ramp up. Yet more coordination between the two industries could help regulate the supply chain better to prevent future crunches. Everyone wants to avoid a repeat of this year's problems. </p><p>\n  The other outcome of the agreement is likely a deal whereby Ford designs chips that GlobalFoundries will make for next-generation EVs. This is a well-established pattern for tech companies such as Apple, Amazon and Google, but not yet for car companies. Intel, too, has spotted the opportunity. It used the platform of the Munich \"mobility\" or auto show in September to announce a big investment in European chip facilities, including for its new contract-manufacturing business. </p><p>\n  It is much less plausible that Ford actually ends up investing in chip foundries itself, though it has been careful not to rule this out. Cynics might wonder whether it is dangling the possibility for political reasons. Ford potentially getting into chip manufacturing in the U.S. -- a priority in Washington -- sounds good at a time when Detroit is lobbying to get extra tax credits for electric vehicles made in unionized factories. If the company really is considering putting money into the infamously capital-hungry foundry business, investors should be worried. </p><p>\n  Just to get into chip design would still be a big step for Ford. Tesla started working on blueprints for bespoke semiconductors in 2016, outsourcing their manufacture to Samsung. Chinese peer NIO also seems to be working on its own chips. Ford might be the first conventional car maker to come up with a plan to follow suit, albeit one that remains vague and might need a step-up in research-and-development spending. Ford spent $7.1 billion on R&amp;D in 2020, compared with $19.5 billion for Apple and $27.6 billion for Google owner Alphabet. </p><p>\n  More collaborations will likely follow. As software becomes a strategic focus for car makers, so will the hardware that runs it. Volkwagen has said it is looking at getting into chip design, though not how. For chip companies, too, it makes sense to get to know the car industry better. Intel said in September that it expected the automotive-silicon market to double by 2030. </p><p>\n  Working together makes sense. But at the end of the day, car makers are better off focusing on making cars, and chip makers the chips. </p><p></p>",
