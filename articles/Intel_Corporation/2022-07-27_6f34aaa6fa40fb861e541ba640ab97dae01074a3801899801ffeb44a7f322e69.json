  "text": "<p>The legislation isn't paid for with a tax increase or other revenue. Lawmakers have said this is a matter of national security, which justifies the additional deficit spending.</p><p>The legislation is set to give semiconductor companies $52.7 billion to encourage them to develop and research products in the U.S. Already, several companies including Intel Corp. have announced plans to build plants in the U.S., on the condition that this legislation passes.</p><p>Right now, most chips are built abroad, which backers of this legislation say opens the U.S. up to security risks and supply-chain delays. The fund is for technology companies to build, expand or modernize facilities, as well as continue exploration and testing.</p><p>The bill also creates a 25% investment tax credit for companies that invest in semiconductor manufacturing.</p><p>Recipients of funds from the bill are banned from using the money for stock buybacks or from paying dividends or making other capital distributions. Chinese military entities are also banned from participating in the programs authorized under this legislation.</p><p>It would prevent companies from using subsidies if they also are building or expanding advanced semiconductor manufacturing plants in China or other potentially unfriendly countries.</p><p>The legislation authorizes roughly $200 billion in science and technology research funding for coming years. The directive on research is broad, related to technology from robotics to high-performance computing to semiconductors.</p><p>The money will be spread across many government agencies for research. The largest portion, $81 billion, will go to the National Science Foundation. The legislation creates a Directorate of Technology and Innovation, and other positions, to oversee the spending and programs created by the bill, including the establishment of university technology centers, and the awarding of scholarships and fellowships to develop the science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.</p>",
