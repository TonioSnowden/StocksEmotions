  "title": "HP, Dell See Swelling Backlogs Amid Hot Demand And Supply Shortages; 'We are selling everything that we build,' says HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores",
  "text": "<p>International Data Corp., one of the leading research firms that tracks device sales, this week cut its projected 2021 PC shipments growth to 14.2%, from 18%, citing shortages and logistical issues. It added that PC demand should persist, though, particularly from the business and education sectors.</p><p>\"We are selling everything that we build,\" HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores said Thursday. \"Demand continues to be strong and the backlog continues to grow,\" he said in an interview, adding that the amount of orders taken in and yet to be fulfilled was the equivalent of a full quarter's business.</p><p>Mr. Lores said HP was seeing mostly shortages in low-cost components that are used across industries and said he expected those to stretch possibly into early 2022.</p><p>Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said he expects the semiconductor shortage that has driven up prices for consumer gadgets to potentially stretch into 2023.</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, and Intel are adding new chip-production plants. Samsung Electronics Co. this week said plans to increase investments by one third to more than $205 billion over the next three years, in part to support chip demand. Some of that capacity won't be ready for two years or more. Amid hot demand, TSMC is raising prices by as much as 20%, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>HP reported a roughly 7% increase in net revenue to $15.3 billion in the July quarter, including a 2% increase in notebook unit sales following supercharged year-ago quarter as people adapted to working from home and remote learning. Profit rose to $1.11 billion.</p><p>The results missed Wall Street expectations on sales but beat on profit. The company also lifted its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $3.69 to $3.75 from $3.40 to $3.50.</p><p>Dell on Thursday reported a roughly 15% increase in net revenue in the July quarter to a record $26.12 billion. Consumer revenue within the client solutions group that includes desktops and notebooks advanced 17% and reached a second-quarter record. Commercial client revenue in the client solutions group rose 32%, Dell said. The company also reported a swelling backlog.</p><p>Fellow PC vendor Lenovo Group Ltd. has said that PCs have taken a more prominent role in people's lives during the pandemic and pointed to bullish industry data projections for overall PC demand, with commercial demand recovering quickly as economies reopened.</p><p>HP's Mr. Lores, earlier in the year, had pointed to recovering demand from businesses as companies began to reopen offices. On Thursday, he said that demand in both HP's print and PC business was materializing, even amid the spread of the contagious Delta variant.</p><p>\"Delta has had an impact in delaying some of the reopening that many companies, including us, were planning. But we are seeing the uptick that we were expecting,\" he said.</p><p>HP, Dell See Swelling Backlogs Amid Hot Demand And Supply Shortages</p>",
