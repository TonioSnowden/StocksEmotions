  "text": "<p>FirstGroup revealed plans for a return of cash to shareholders after agreeing to sell two North American bus businesses to Swedish-based private equity group EQT Infrastructure for £3.3bn. </p> <p>The transport operator proposed a return of £365m, equivalent to about 30 pence per share, during current calendar year. A further £1.35bn will be used to reduce debt and tackle liabilities including its UK pension deficit, with&#xa0;£300m earmarked to repay a loan under the government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility.</p> <p>Aberdeen-based FirstGroup first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f24b88a0-1fd3-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96\">appointed advisers</a> in December 2019 to weigh up the sale of the First Student and First Transit businesses, having come under pressure from investors including Coast Capital and Robert Tchenguiz.</p> <p>“We see the disposal as a clear positive, allowing the group to be simplified and refocused on the UK,” said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo. “Instead of dealing with a constrained balance sheet, the ongoing group will benefit from reduced leverage and surplus capital to deal with legacy liabilities, while still funding a return of cash to shareholders.”</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>UK retail sales</strong> grew more than forecast last month as shoppers bought more clothes and gardening products ahead of the relaxation of some Covid-19 restrictions. Retail sales rose 5.4 per cent in March compared with the previous month, data from the Office for National Statistics showed. Economists had forecast an increase of just 1.5 per cent. Separately, the ONS said the UK government had borrowed £303.1bn in the year ending in March, an increase of £246.1bn on the previous year and the most since the second world war.</p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> said the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its Jemperli drug for the treatment of women with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer.</p> <p>Photo booth and vending machine group <strong>Photo-Me</strong> said trading in recent months has exceeded expectations, driven by stronger than anticipated trading momentum in Japan. The company cited a recent promotion by the Japanese government of an identity card scheme that is due to run until September. With trading outside Japan meeting expectations, Photo-Me raised its pre-exceptional, pre-tax profit target for the year ending October to between £15m and £19m from £9m previously.</p> <p><strong>Fulham Shore</strong>, owner of Franco Manca and The Real Greek restaurant chains, said group sales last week had been “very encouraging” and ahead of pre-lockdown levels. Recent performance supported the company's confidence in looking for new locations, with the opportunity to take over failed operators' sites likely to cut opening costs and improve the return on capital, it said in a trading update.</p> <p><strong>Senior</strong>, the aerospace and defence engineer, said first-quarter trading had been in line with expectations. Aerospace sales dropped 25 per cent for the quarter but were up 2 per cent relative to the last three months of 2020, the company said. The company's Flexonics division, which makes components for vehicles and industrial machinery, reported a 10 per cent jump in sales versus the fourth quarter thanks in part to a recovery in the heavy duty truck and off-highway markets. </p> <p><strong>Record</strong>, the currency hedging specialist, said its assets under management grew by 37 per cent in the 12 months ended March to $80.1bn. It recruited 17 new clients in the period, and 10 in the fiscal fourth quarter alone, which took the total to 89. </p> <p><strong>Bloomsbury</strong> said it has agreed to buy academic publisher&#xa0;Red Globe Press from Macmillan Education for up to £3.7m.</p> <p>Podcast company <strong>AudioBoom</strong> said it expected full-year revenues “significantly in excess” of current market expectations. Sales momentum had been strong with signed advertising bookings for the year now covering more than 95 per cent of its recently upgraded revenue guidance for 2021, the company said.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>China's central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dbc6256-c8cd-48c1-9a0f-bb83a578a42e\">is attempting to take control</a> of <strong>Ant Group's</strong> vast trove of consumer lending data, marking the latest front in Beijing's crackdown on Jack Ma's financial technology group. The People's Bank of China wants Ant to turn over its data, one of the most valuable assets in Ma's internet empire, to a state-controlled credit scoring company that would be run by former executives of the central bank, according to people close to the negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Intel</strong> comfortably beat Wall Street expectations in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be61a4db-fb1f-4756-8fe8-ad21568d9fc5\">latest quarter</a> as continued strong sales of PCs during the pandemic made up most of the ground lost from weaker data centre demand. Despite modestly raising its forecasts for the rest of this year, the US chipmaker's shares slipped 3 per cent in after-market trading as Wall Street digested figures released late on Thursday that revealed sliding profit margins and escalating capital spending.</p> <p>US <strong>airlines</strong> struck <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/429cc929-eae3-4a3f-9b43-4bcfae4ecb9e\">an optimistic note</a> on Thursday, saying the “worst is behind us” with vaccinations and easing coronavirus restrictions boosting demand ahead of the summer holiday season. More than a year after air travel was all but halted by the pandemic, demand has started to recover, fuelled by vaccinations.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>City Insider <br></strong>Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater, is backing a new psychometric test; the latest in the long-running Russian soap opera that is Petropavlovsk and how Just Eat chief executive Jitse Groen is working to be Europe's equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46be3f78-e585-4234-989d-5516879062b1\">Elon Musk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Those looking for a quick fix at GlaxoSmithKline, from its management or new shareholder Elliott Management, may <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f411acf1-1d4e-4ecf-a902-6435b8924c90\">ultimately be disappointed</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
