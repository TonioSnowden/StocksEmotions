  "title": "More than a quarter of Nasdaq-100 stocks are in bear markets — Wall Street sees a buying opportunity",
  "text": "<p>Before looking at those stocks, let's take a quick look at the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX. It is made up of the largest 100 non-financial stocks in the full Nasdaq Composite Index COMP and is weighted by market capitalization. The Nasdaq-100 has greatly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index SPX (which is also weighted by market cap) in recent years.</p><p>Using exchange-traded funds that track both — the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ for the Nasdaq-100 and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, here is a 10-year chart showing total returns, with dividends reinvested:</p><p>FactSetOne reason for QQQ's outperformance over the past 10 years has been its heavy concentration in giant tech companies. As of the close on Sept. 27, the top five companies held by QQQ (Apple Inc . AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc . AMZN, Tesla Inc . TSLA and two common-share classes of Alphabet Inc . GOOGGOOGL) made up 41.3% of the portfolio. Meanwhile the top five positions of SPY (the same, except replace Tesla with Facebook Inc . FB) made up 22.6% of its portfolio.</p><p>Another important difference between the indexes is the Nasdaq-100 includes American depositary receipts of some non-U.S. companies, while the S&amp;P 500 excludes ADRs. Some of the ADRs held by QQQ are included in the list below.</p><p>Here's a comparison of average annual returns for the two ETFs over many periods:</p><p> ETF                         3 Years  5 Years  10 years  15 Years  20 Years  Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ       25.6%    25.8%    22.0%     16.6%     14.2%  SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust  SPY  16.3%    17.0%    16.4%     10.3%     9.5%  Source: FactSet</p><p>One thing to keep an eye on is the relative cost of the indexes/ETFs. QQQ looks a bit expensive relative to where it usually trades against SPY. Here's a comparison of current forward price-to-earnings ratios with averages:</p><p> ETF                     Forward P/E  10-year average forward P/E  15-year average forward P/E  Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ   26.95        19.32                        18.73  SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust   20.82        16.37                        15.26  Source: FactSet</p><p>So QQQ now trades for 129% of SPY's forward P/E valuation. It has traded for 118% of SPY's forward P/E on average over 10 years and 123% based on the 15-year averages.</p><p>The Nasdaq-100 bear list</p><p>There are actually 102 stocks in the Nasdaq-100 because Alphabet and Fox Corp . have two common-share classes apiece.
