  "title": "Intel to Cut Jobs in Cost-Savings Drive as PC Slump Weighs on Earnings; Chip maker says it is targeting up to $10 billion in annualized cost reductions by 2025",
  "text": "<p>Intel Corp. has embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting push and is considering divestitures as the chip maker tries to navigatea sharp plunge in demand for PCs that has weighed on the company's earnings.</p><p>Intel posted a 20% drop in third-quarter sales, issued a forecast for even weaker revenue in the current quarter and lowered its full-year outlook.</p><p>The company is beginning targeted job cuts and making other adjustments including reducing factory hours to cope with the economic downturn, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in an interview Thursday. He wouldn't specify how many of Intel's more than 120,000 employees would be affected.</p><p>\"We are aggressively addressing costs and driving efficiencies across the business,\" he said. He added that the company was looking at possible divestitures, among other moves.</p><p>Intel said it was working to deliver $3 billion in cost reductions in 2023, growing to $8 billion to $10 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiency gains by the end of 2025. The company took a $664 million restructuring charge in the third quarter to reflect initial cost reductions.</p><p>Intel posted $15.3 billion in sales in the third quarter, generating net income of $1 billion. It forecast sales of $14 billion to $15 billion for the current quarter, below the $16.3 billion Wall Street has been expecting, and cut its full-year sales forecast, now projecting up to $64 billion in sales, down from as much as $68 billion in July. Intel said it reduced capital-spending plans from $27 billion to $25 billion for this year.</p><p>Intel and other chip makers cashed in on a boom in computer and electronics sales at the outset of the pandemic with the shift toward remote work and distance learning. The market has turned, though, withhigh inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears that have weighed on demand.</p><p>Tech companies more broadly are facing some of these pressures, driving gloomier-than-expected outlooks this week at companies including Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. that have sent their shares sharply lower. The strong dollar also has dented their earnings.</p><p>\"We are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023,\" Mr. Gelsinger said on an earnings call. \"It's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon.\"</p><p>Intel shares fell more than 3% before the results, though advanced more than 4% in post-market trading after laying out the cost-cutting drive.</p><p>Intel has been one of the worst-hit in the chip industry because of its heavy exposure to the PC market. The company posted a surprise loss in the second quarter on softening computer demand. PC shipments are estimated to have seen a 15% contraction in the third quarter, according to International Data Corp. Third quarter sales in the segment fell 17%.</p><p>Intel, which derives about half its revenue from the division that houses its PC chips, said it was expecting the computer market to shrink this year by around 15% to 19%, a bigger dip than it earlier forecast, and that it could contract further next year. That division's sales fell 17% in the third quarter.</p><p>The company is also being challenged in the datacenter market. Intel chips predominate in server farms that process data for companies and governments, but it is facing growing competition there from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel's datacenter division reported a revenue fall of 27% to $4.2 billion for the third quarter.</p><p>The weakness in Intel's core business comes as it is expanding manufacturing and seeking to catch up to rivals in Taiwan and South Korea in the race to build the fastest, most cutting-edge chips. But the ambition doesn't come cheap. Mr. Gelsinger, who took the helm last year, has disclosed plans to build plants in Arizona, Ohio and Germany, among other expansions. Those projects could cost hundreds of billions of dollars combined.</p><p>\"While Intel presses ahead with their long-term strategy, it is now abundantly clear that the path to get there was built on a shaky foundation which is now collapsing as PCs appear likely to revert to pre-COVID levels in the near future,\" Bernstein Research analysts said in a note.</p><p>One challenge in making cost cuts, which include both workforce reductions and efforts to make factories run more cost-effectively, is to execute them while preserving a strategy to expand the company's manufacturing footprint and catch up to rivals, Mr. Gelsinger said.</p><p>\"It really is hitting the accelerator and the brake at the same time,\" he said. While Intel will build new plants, it will hold off on buying the costly chip-making equipment until those tools are really needed, he said.</p><p>Intel is hoping to ease the financial burden of its expansion by tapping incentives in the U.S. and Europe, where governments are trying to attract chip production with financial inducements. Intel also struck a deal with Canada's Brookfield Asset Management in August to share costs of the expansion in Arizona. Mr. Gelsinger said Thursday that Intel was working to put together further deals like the one with Brookfield in the near future.</p><p>The chip company listed a small portion of its self-driving technology unit Mobileye Global Inc. on Wednesday, pricing the listing above the top of its targeted range and raising $861 million. Mr. Gelsinger said at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference Monday that the objective of the IPO wasn't to raise cash but to better-position Mobileye for growth. Mobileye's shares rose 38% in their trading debut.</p><p>Signs have begun to emerge that the deteriorating economic outlook is causing a long-running shortage of chips to ease. Mr. Gelsinger earlier this year predicted it could last into 2024.</p><p>Chips geared toward markets beyond PCs and smartphones have also started to show signs of flagging demand. Texas Instruments Inc. on Tuesday said it saw weakness in its industrial segment, prompting a selloff in its shares. The chip industry more recently has been hit by U.S. curbs on some sales to China. Rules put in place this month require chip companies to get licenses from the Commerce Department before exporting certain chip-making equipment and high-performance artificial intelligence and supercomputing chips to China. Mr. Gelsinger said Monday that American restrictions were inevitable as the geopolitical rivalry between the countries intensifies.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger described the impact of the restrictions on Intel as \"pretty minor.\"</p><p>Chip maker Nvidia Corp. warned that it could lose up to $400 million of quarterly revenue because of the restrictions, and manufacturing-equipment makers Lam Research Corp., KLA Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. warned of potential revenue drops that, combined, amount to billions of dollars in the coming year.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>Intel to Cut Jobs in Cost-Savings Drive as PC Slump Weighs on Earnings</p>",
