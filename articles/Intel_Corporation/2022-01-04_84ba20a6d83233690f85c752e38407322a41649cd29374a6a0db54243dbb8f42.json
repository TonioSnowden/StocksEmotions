  "title": "Intel focuses on autonomous driving, gaming and laptop chips at CES 2022",
  "text": "<p>In a Media Days presentation that was streamed for those not in attendance at the Las Vegas tech conference, Intel INTC introduced its 12th generation Core i9-12900HK processor for laptops, which it said offered 40% higher performance and up to 28% faster game play from its previous i9-11980HK chip.</p><p>The company said it expects more than 100 devices from Acer Inc. TW:2353, AsusTek Computer Inc. TW:2357, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, HP Inc. HPQ, Lenovo Group Ltd. HK:992 and more to carry the i9-12900HK. Additionally, Intel introduced its ultraportable mobile P-series product line for thin-and-light laptops.</p><p>Read: The pandemic boom in videogames is expected to disappear in 2022</p><p>The chip maker also said it was shipping its “Alchemist” Arc ray-tracing graphics chip this quarter to original equipment manufacturers to be used in more than 50 mobile and desktop products. Intel has been trying to develop new gaming technology that can challenge rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDAand Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, chip makers that have managed to effectively challenge Intel in the data center and other chip markets in recent years.</p><p>“This is such a huge step forward in our XPU journey,” Gregory Bryant, who leads Intel's Client Computing Group, said in Tuesday's presentation.</p><p>Earlier in the day, both Nvidia and AMD announced their latest releases for gaming chips and laptops in presentations linked to CES but not part of the official Media Days lineup.</p><p>Read: For the videogame industry to grow, it needs to first grow up</p><p>Intel also detailed a new Mobileye chip for autonomous driving, which it foresees as the cheap chip needed to get automated driving in the hands of consumers. Most experts expect vehicles with more autonomous capabilities to roll out in the coming years, but not in cars owned by typical consumers — most are expected to be ride-hail vehicles or freight-movers, like big-rigs, where higher prices will lead to savings over time for the owner.&#xa0;</p><p>Mobileye is marketing the EyeQ Ultra as a system-on-a-chip that can scale down the price of automated driving for consumers, with capability for Level 4 autonomous driving, just short of full autonomy. Mobileye, which Intel expects to spin off this year in an initial public offering, projected that the chips will start being produced in late 2023 and full automotive-grade production to hit in 2025.&#xa0;</p><p>Mobileye announced other advancements Tuesday with Geely Automotive Holdings Ltd.'s HK:175Zeekr&#xa0;electric-vehicle brand from China. The two companies are producing and shipping a new “Level 2+” advanced driver-assistance system, and plan to begin&#xa0;production in 2023 on a Level 4 consumer car.&#xa0;Mobileye also brought out Ford Motor Co. FChief Executive Jim Farley to discuss work being done with that automaker, as well as Volkswagen Group XE:VOWCEO Herbert Diess, who detailed his company's integration of Mobileye's mapping features.&#xa0;</p><p>“We just couldn't offer the systems we do at Ford without you, and we're betting on Mobileye for the future,” Farley told Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua in the presentation.</p><p>Intel shares were up 0.3% in recent activity, while AMD and Nvidia stocks fell in morning trading after earlier presentations. Shares are up 7% over the past 12 months, compared with a 42% gain on the PHLX Semiconductor Index&#xa0;SOX and a 30% gain on the S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX.</p>",
