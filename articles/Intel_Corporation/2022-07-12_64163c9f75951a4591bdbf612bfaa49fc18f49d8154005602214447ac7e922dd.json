  "text": "<p>Both chip makers and the French government said Monday that a goal was to support the European Union's ambition of becoming less dependent on other countries for important technologies.</p><p>The expanding footprint of New York-based GlobalFoundries would help provide its customers with supply-chain security, said Chief Executive Thomas Caulfield, adding that it would have been a challenge to do the project without French governmental support.</p><p>Over the past two years, the U.S., China and European countries raced to strengthen their domestic chip-making abilities because of a confluence of factors. Though the U.S. and Europe have leading companies in developing semiconductor technology, many of the actual chip manufacturers are in East Asia, including Taiwan.</p><p>The global chip shortage, which only recently showed signs of starting to abate, and a pandemic that caused shipping delays spurred politicians to take steps to localize what has long been a globally integrated supply chain.</p><p>The EU earlier this year introduced a plan to make available about $49 billion to boost European chip research and production. Shortly after, Intel Corp. announced its intention to build plants for advanced chips in Germany and suggested the project would be contingent upon the government support coming through.</p><p>Intel is building facilities in Ohio, saying the scope and pace of those plans depend on how quickly Congress allocates about $52 billion in funding for expanding U.S. chip production and research and development.</p><p>In 2019, China set up a government-backed $29 billion fund to boost its domestic chip industry, and last year it announced plans to speed up development in advanced technologies, including chips, by 2025.</p><p>GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics, which is based in Switzerland, said the French plant would focus on making chips for automotive, communications and industrial uses.</p>",
