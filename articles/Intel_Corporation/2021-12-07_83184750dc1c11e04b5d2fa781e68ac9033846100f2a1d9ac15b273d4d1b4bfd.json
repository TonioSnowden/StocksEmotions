  "title": "Nvidia stock slips to close in correction territory, joining AMD",
  "text": "<p>Nvidia NVDA shares fell 2.1% to close Monday at $300.37, or 10% below their all-time closing high of $333.76 set on Nov. 29. Shares had fallen as low as $280.38 intraday, but a rally back was not enough to save them from the 10% decline mark that defines a correction.</p><p>The stock, however, is still up 122% over the past 12 months, and a $750.93 billion market cap still ranks it as the most valuable U.S. chip maker.</p><p>Read:Nvidia's deal for ARM is dead â€” how long until CEO Jensen Huang admits it?</p><p>On Friday, Nvidia shares threatened to move into a correction but were saved by a late-session rally that left them down 8% from recent highs. Late Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission sued&#xa0;to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. JP:9984 that has met with several headwinds since it was first&#xa0;announced back in late 2020.</p><p>AMD AMD shares, which fell into a correction on Friday, declined 3.4% to close at $139.06 on Monday. Shares are now 13.7% below their closing high of $161.09 set on Nov. 29.</p><p>While in much better shape than Nvidia's possible acquisition, AMD has yet to close on its $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx Inc. XLNX, which it still expects by the end of the year. AMD and Xilinx shareholders both approved the deal back in April.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel Corp. INTC shares bounced back Monday, closing up 3.5% at $50.99, but were still mired in bear territory, nearly 26% off their 52-week closing high of $68.26 set on April 9.</p>",
