  "text": "<p>After months of public criticism by Elon Musk against Twitter Inc., the social-media company fired back forcefully on Tuesday with a lawsuit seeking to enforce the billionaire's deal to buy it for $44 billion.</p><p>The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, is by far the fullest rebuttal by Twitter to complaints by Mr. Musk that culminated in his lawyer telling the company on Friday that he intended to abandon the deal he had struck with Twitter's board 74 days earlier. Twitter's lawyers also made a number of accusations of their own about how Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., behaved before and after the deal was struck on April 25.</p><p>Below is a summary of some of the key points Twitter's lawyers lay out in the lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Musk and his legal team didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday. In Friday's letter, his lawyer wrote that Twitter was \"in material breach of multiple provisions\" of the deal and appeared to have made \"false and misleading representations\" when entering into the agreement.</p><p>Who Is Telling the Truth about Fake Accounts?</p><p>Mr. Musk has said wanted to acquire Twitter in part to tackle the presence of spam and fake accounts on the platform. In a statement announcing the merger, he said he would prioritize \"defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\"</p><p>The issue has now become the central reason he has given for trying to walk away from the deal. Mr. Musk has expressed doubt about Twitter's longstanding estimate that less than 5% of monetizable daily active users are spam or false accounts. His lawyer's letter Friday said \"Mr. Musk has reason to believe that the true number of false or spam accounts on Twitter's platform is substantially higher than the amount of less than 5% represented by Twitter in its SEC filings.\"</p><p>Twitter's lawsuit says Mr. Musk made his offer without seeking any explanation regarding its estimates of spam or false accounts.</p><p>Twitter says that when it \"nonetheless bent over backwards\" to address Mr. Musk's requests, he \"resorted to false assertions that it had not.\" In a June 20 letter, the complaint says:</p><p>Who Had Say on Personnel Decisions?</p><p>In Friday's letter, Mr. Musk's lawyer said that Twitter had failed to uphold its obligations in the deal to obtain the tycoon's consent before \"deviating from its obligation to conduct its business in the ordinary course and 'preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization.'\" The letter pointed to a hiring freeze implemented in May along with the departure of two top executives, as well as Twitter's decision last week to lay of 30% of its talent acquisition team.</p><p>Twitter's lawsuit disputes those contentions on several fronts. For one, it says Mr. Musk had no right to review such decisions:</p><p>The suit also argues that the decisions Twitter made \"aligned with Musk's own stated priorities,\" referring in part to conversations he had with Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal:</p><p>Hello, It's Twitter. Is Anybody There?</p><p>In its filing, Twitter describes frustration over what it viewed as the lack of any clear point of contact on Mr. Musk's side to hammer out details for part of the time they were working to implement the merger agreement.</p><p>The social-media company said in the filing that, for some time after the deal was inked, it interacted with Bob Swan, the former Intel Corp. CEO, who represented Mr. Musk with an eye to securing financing on the deal. Twitter said it was in touch with Mr. Swan as late as June 20 to arrange a retention program to keep key employees from jumping ship during the transition period.</p><p>But Twitter's suit says it never got a response from Mr. Musk's side:</p><p>Twitter says it tried to find out who had replaced Mr. Swan:</p><p>Eventually Mr. Musk responded to Twitter's CFO, the suit says:</p><p>Mr. Swan and Mr. Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners and a former Tesla board member, didn't respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Musk's Tweets About Twitter</p><p>Mr. Musk, in the merger agreement, agreed not to disparage Twitter or its representatives after criticizing the platform ahead of the deal. In the lawsuit, Twitter claims Mr. Musk violated those and other commitments he made to Twitter.</p><p>To spell out its case, Twitter cited the Tesla CEO's numerous tweets about the deal as evidence. Among them:</p><p>Mr. Musk's assertion made in a tweet that the deal was \"temporarily on hold.\"</p><p>Twitter said Mr. Musk didn't take seriously a confidentiality agreement, citing a May 14 tweet.</p><p>Mr. Musk urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto probe Twitter:</p><p>Money Matters</p><p>The financial picture for Mr. Musk and for the proposed deal has deteriorated since Mr. Musk started buying Twitter's stock in January, in the run-up to his takeover effort.</p><p>Shares in Tesla, which account for most of Mr. Musk's wealth, are down sharply from the all-time high they hit in November, and the outlook has darkened for Twitter and other social-media companies that rely on digital advertising.</p><p>Mr. Musk initially planned to finance the takeover in part through $12.5 billion from margin loans backed by more than $62.5 billion worth of Tesla shares that he owns. He subsequently reworked the financing plan to eliminate that borrowing, pledging more equity financing instead.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, has said he doesn't care \"at all\" about the economics of buying Twitter.</p><p>Twitter's suit argues that Mr. Musk's attempt to withdraw from his agreement, in fact, flows from the changing economic situation:</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter's Lawsuit Against Elon Musk: The Main Points</p>",
