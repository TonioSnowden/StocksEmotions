  "text": "<p><br>Dear readers,</p> <p>This week brought a timely reminder that for all the intangible technology seeing us through lockdown — streamed movies, music and games — we still as a species have an indelible attachment to <em>things</em>. As of now, there are 20,000-plus boxes of physical goods atop the Ever Given container ship, which is wedged in the Suez Canal. There it sits, regally blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes.</p> <p>Salvage experts reckon it could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31dbe2b9-3ff2-4bcc-a3e3-813600caeb49\">take weeks</a> to dislodge the vessel, which is as long as the Empire State Building is tall. Falling — or rather immobile — dominoes are gathering; by Thursday an estimated 200 vessels were stranded either side of the stranded ship.</p> <p>Supply chains, already stretched thin by pestilence and politics, were sent reeling. About 12 per cent of trade flows through Suez, with an average 50 vessels a day plying their trade through the thoroughfare bearing oil, coffee and grains.</p> <p>Markets, judging from the collapsed earning valuation multiples of big shippers, reckon freight rates are in for a fall. Not so fast, says Lex. Supply chain glitches for everything from automotive chips to medical supplies, means companies will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/273433b1-6677-431a-8037-1fd9c62adf84\">order more</a> in an effort to boost inventory cushions.</p> <p>Blockages are rare — there have only been a handful in the Suez Canal's 151-year history — but ships and chips share an inherent cyclicality. There is correlation with economic growth and long lead times, which magnify the peaks and troughs. Case in point: the current chip shortage has spurred state and private actors to ramp up the volume. Take Intel, which is spending $20bn on two fabs and one fabless plant.</p> <p>The US tech giant has run the numbers and come up with the same kind of skewed ratio that has China officials sweating: almost half of global chip sales occur in the US, though American production is only about a tenth of the total. (Global supply chains and end-customer locations, incidentally, render these calculations less than strictly meaningful).</p> <p>Intel's big building plans have the backing of Washington, Google — and Lex. The $20bn capex is justified by the $15bn of (pre-latest sending proposals) forecast annual free cash flow, and its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eebe397-8644-4130-8337-00fe99aa05aa\">supersizing strategy makes sense</a>.</p> <p>It is not just whopping great vessels jamming up global flows. Washington is doing its bit to impede capital flows by reviving threats to delist Chinese companies quoted in the US. Such <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828c1ec0-ba68-4f6b-a4a2-1bed585c2a8b\">delistings</a>, says Lex, are now inevitable: many US-quoted Chinese companies would have trouble complying with US audit requirements without violating Chinese laws.</p> <p>But beware of unintended consequences. The biggest losers of this particular blockade, reckons Lex, are stateside. China's CSI 300 index racked up gains of almost 60 per cent in the 12 months before February's reversal. Even after recent declines, the index trades at 16.8 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, a 40 per cent discount to the Nasdaq 100 and lower than the 22 times for the S&amp;P 500. Americans would miss out on a slice of this growth and, with it, diversification from their overheated domestic market.</p> <p>Facebook is all about communication flows — billions and billions of them — but rather a lot of its supposed users are no more than a string of code. In the last quarter of 2020, Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5242c34f-f7fc-4005-9b49-49674cedeb71\">disabled 1.3bn fake accounts</a> — a tally equal to almost half its real monthly active users.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the past two years, it has been removing at least 1bn fake accounts each quarter, but even that is just the tip of the iceberg. In filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Facebook acknowledges that up to 5 per cent of the 2.8bn accounts it counts may be false, and another 11 per cent may be duplicates. In sum, that means more than 448m inauthentic accounts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Facebook's targeted advertising model is already under pressure. Fake accounts could prompt advertisers, who generally like to reach real people with real wallets, to demand lower rates, slowing Facebook's revenue growth. Alternatively, ramped-up spending on fake-busting measures would crimp Facebook's operating margins.</p> <p>On top of that is reputational damage. Bots undermine credibility, both of Facebook and of the analysts who pay little heed to the authenticity of users. At least one reader was not surprised by the latter, writing: “That is because analysts are cheerleaders, sycophants and stenographers. They are not paid to dig, delve or otherwise diverge from the equity ‘story'.”&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a somewhat cheerier prospect that put the kibosh on Leonardo's planned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d30d22-290c-43dd-a539-3954728520ce\">DRS spin-off</a>. A less bellicose world means shrunken military budgets, and that in turn has dented appetites for defence assets. Hence, the Italian aerospace and defence group's decision to mothball its planned partial float of US electronics subsidiary DRS.</p> <p>That still caused ructions for the group, which hoped&#xa0;to&#xa0;unlock value for long-suffering minority shareholders and funnel proceeds of about $700m into European mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>But Lex, gloomier about the prospects for warmongering, sees a path to growth for DRS.&#xa0;</p> <p>Budgets focused on combating insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan are reorienting to conventional warfare — playing to the strengths of DRS, which specialises in electronics for ships and armoured vehicles.&#xa0;DRS's mooted $3.1bn valuation is well below the $5.2bn Leonardo (then Finmeccanica) paid in 2008.</p> <p>Still, the implied ebitda multiple of 15 times is steep for a US business of this kind. The real nub for US investors, however, concerns Italian politicians' internecine meddling in business, exacerbated in this case by a large state shareholding. That penchant, alas, is older than the Suez Canal.</p> <p>May your own weekend be smoother sailing,</p> <p><strong>Louise Lucas</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em> </p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/273433b1-6677-431a-8037-1fd9c62adf84\">Suez Canal/supply chains: stuck ship sinks trade flows</a> <br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eebe397-8644-4130-8337-00fe99aa05aa\">Intel: cold war heats up domestic chip production </a><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828c1ec0-ba68-4f6b-a4a2-1bed585c2a8b\">Chinese delistings: exodus will hurt US investors most</a> <br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5242c34f-f7fc-4005-9b49-49674cedeb71\">Facebook: the billion dollar bot problem </a><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d30d22-290c-43dd-a539-3954728520ce\">Leonardo/DRS: tanks but no thanks say US investors</a> <br></p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Best of Lex: staunching the flows of trade, money and chat' FT.com 26 March.
