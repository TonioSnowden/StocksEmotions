  "title": "Threat of Rail Strike Reveals Persistent Supply Chain Risks to U.S. Economy; Businesses and policy makers plan for 'new normal' of potential disruption of supplies of everything from coal to components",
  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What steps can the U.S. take to better secure its transportation networks? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Railroads move almost 30% of U.S. freight by ton-mile, a measure of weight and distance traveled. Some products such as coal, fertilizer, grains or chemicals are particularly reliant on rail. Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm, put the costs of a strike at $60 million on the first day, then rising as the strike continues.</p><p>Other estimates have put the ultimate costs in the billions of dollars, based in part on prolonged shortages resulting from a lack of alternative delivery channels for key items. The American Trucking Associations said that shifting freight from railcars to trucks would have required more than 460,000 additional trucks and drivers—and when the trucking industry is already facing an acute driver shortage.</p><p>Congress moved quickly to avert a strike. A bipartisan bill sped through the House on Wednesday, then through the Senate on Thursday before it landed Friday on Mr. Biden's desk. Driving the rare example of bipartisan activity was the risk that a strike—and the resulting backlogs and shortages—would make U.S. inflation worse just as it has started to easefrom 40-year highs.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials, who once viewed supply-chain problems as a temporary effect of the pandemic, now say they could be here to stay. Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Monday warned of the \"fragility of global supply chains.\" On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said supply constraints could be creating a \"new normal\" for the U.S. economy.</p><p>\"Are we going into a situation a little bit like the '70s where there will be ongoing repeat shocks which would tend to put more upward pressure on inflation over time?\" Mr. Powell asked at a Brookings Institution event.</p><p>The strike threat highlighted a distribution network in which businesses have sought to reduce delivery costs by becoming as lean as possible, said Balaji Guntur, chief operating officer at Hoptek, a logistics technology company. While the approach has improved profits, it also has made it more difficult to respond to shocks such as a global pandemic.</p><p>\"We are exposing cracks in our supply chains' ability to handle all of the things that we demand of it,\" he said. \"Supply chains used to move a little bit more slowly and there was enough slack in the system that provided some resilience.\"</p><p>And yet, adding more slack into the system would also drive up long-term costs that would be borne by businesses and consumers. \"I may want to get the best price on my next bag of chips,\" Mr. Guntur said. \"But if I want to be guaranteed a bag of chips tomorrow and the next day and so on I may have to pay.\"</p><p>Over the past three years, the global supply chain has absorbed blows that have driven up consumer prices. First, Covid-related shutdowns slashed factory production around the world but particularly in China. At the same time, government stimulus programs in the U.S. and elsewhere boosted demand for goods despite supply constraints.</p><p>Ocean shipping rates rose eightfold between March 2020 and September 2021 but have since fallen back to near prepandemic levels, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.</p><p>A Closer Look at Supply-Chain issues</p><p>* The Logistics and Supply-Chain Slowdown Has Begun. Here's How to Take Advantage.</p><p>* Globalized Supply Chain Brings More-Turbulent Food Prices</p><p>* Some Retailers Are Learning to Love Bulked-Up Inventories</p><p>Earlier this year, Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted global energy flows as the supply of Russian oil and natural gas shrank following Western sanctions. Starting in the summer, shipping suffered when dry weather lowered water levels on major inland waterways in China, Europe and the U.S.</p><p>Labor disputes have also flared as pandemic-related worker shortages gave unions more leverage over employers. Strikes and protests have hampered ports in the U.K. and France. Uncertainty over labor talks at Southern California ports caused some shippers to divert cargo to East Coast ports.</p><p>\"The supply chain network as a whole, both domestically and globally, is just not catching any breaks,\" said Nick Vyas, a professor at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.</p><p>Even before the latest labor strife, freight rail customers in the U.S. complained that low staffing levels had hampered rail service, prompting scrutiny from federal regulators.</p><p>The seven largest U.S. freight railroads have cut their workforces by 29% since 2016, according to the Surface Transportation Board, the government's railroad regulator. The trims have made the companies leaner but also have put more pressure on workers, limiting their ability to take time off, a stumbling block in the current round of labor negotiations.</p><p>Rail users said staffing shortages became critical during the pandemic as railroads struggled to rehire many of the workers they had furloughed when the virus started to spread. A backup of ships off Southern California ports also caused congestion to snowball across the entire freight transportation system.</p><p>Railroads say they have bought new locomotives and hired thousands of workers to improve service. \"Union Pacific is keenly aware of our customers' concerns and has been taking aggressive measures to reduce congestion,\" said Robynn Tysver, a spokesperson for Union Pacific Corp.</p><p>\"We have made improvements in service throughout the year and we are continuously monitoring key service metrics,\" said Zak Andersen, a spokesman for BNSF Railway Co.</p><p>Early signs suggest that companies are rethinking their operations in light of ongoing supply problems. A bill enacted this summer offers incentives to manufacturers to open semiconductor plants in the U.S. as a way to limit the country's reliance on imports. In September, Intel Corp. broke ground on a $20 billion factory in Columbus, Ohio. Some firms are thinking about moving production from China to Vietnam and other countries in response to China's strict Covid-related lockdowns.</p><p>In the U.S., industries that rely heavily on rail are making plans for further disruptions. Electric utilities are considering holding bigger stockpiles of coal so they can continue to produce electricity even if railroad coal shipments are disrupted, said Emily Regis, president of the National Coal Transportation Association, which brings together coal producers, power plants and shippers.</p><p>\"That's more money to invest to keep it on the ground and you don't get your return until you burn it and make power,\" she said.</p><p>Some chemical companies are also looking to move to other transportation modes, said Scott Jensen, a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council.</p><p>But alternatives will take time to develop. Over the years, the rail network has become intertwined with the normal functioning of many industries. Chemical companies and electric utilities have spent billions of dollars on railcars and other infrastructure for their shipments.</p><p>And railroads have been crucial for American farmers, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.</p><p>\"The ability to put soybeans in a hopper car and have it go 1,500 miles to an export terminal by Portland, Ore., is one of the main reasons why a farmer in Western Minnesota grows beans that are ultimately consumed by livestock in China,\" he said.</p><p>\"Yes, we're always trying to diversify\" supply chains, he added. \"But there's a reason why rail is such an important part of our industry and I expect that will remain the case.\"</p><p>Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com</p><p>Threat of Rail Strike Reveals Persistent Supply Chain Risks to U.S. Economy</p>",
