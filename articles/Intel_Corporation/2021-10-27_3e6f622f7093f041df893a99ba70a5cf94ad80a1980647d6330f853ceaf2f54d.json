Both options enable full virtual and on-demand access to the programme. </p> <h2>The anatomy of a flawed audit</h2> <p>It seems <strong>EY Global</strong>'s managing partner <strong>Andy Baldwin</strong> has a gift for understatement. </p> <p>“This audit is not one we could be proud of,” he told the FT, talking about EY's role as an auditor to, you guessed it, <strong>Wirecard</strong>. </p> <p>As Munich prosecutors investigate what they call a “fraud in the billions” at the collapsed German payments company, EY is facing a reckoning. </p> <p>The FT's Olaf Storbeck has scrutinised hundreds of pages of internal documents and emails and interviewed more than a dozen people at the centre of the failed audit to piece together exactly what went wrong. </p> <p>Several EY Germany partners are now under investigation by Munich criminal prosecutors and the country's audit watchdog <strong>Apas</strong> — which suspects four EY partners knowingly issued factually incorrect audits. The auditor denies this, and the four partners deny any wrongdoing. </p> <p>It's well-worth reading <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcadbdcb-5cd7-487e-afdd-1e926831e9b7\">the whole deep dive</a>, but one particular highlight is a shopping trip by EY staff in December 2018. The auditors were shopping online with merchants identified as clients of Wirecard's Asian partners, in a bid to scrutinise Wirecard's operations more closely. &#xa0;</p> <p>They bought a subscription to an Asian porn site, some “coins” for the Fifa 19 football video game, a breathalyser and some bitcoin. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The expedition gave Wirecard a clean bill of health — but the merchants did not exist. </p> <p>It turns out the EY staff had used prepaid cards supplied by Wirecard for the shopping exercise, enabling executives at the payments group to manipulate the transactions, an inquiry later found. </p> <p>Executives at EY have widely diverging views about its involvement with the payments company. When the Big Four firm received evidence that Wirecard was a fraud in June 2020 a senior EY partner said: “Finally! We nailed them,” according to people familiar with the situation. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, a senior partner at EY Germany says the auditor should never have worked for a payments processor operating in high-risk areas such as pornography and gambling: “We never really understood what kind of milieu we were working in.”&#xa0;</p> <h2>Sequoia's ‘boldest innovation yet'</h2> <p><strong>Sequoia Capital</strong>, one of Silicon Valley's most storied venture capital operations, is sitting pretty. </p> <p>At least the firm appeared to think so on Tuesday, when it announced a radically new fund structure it called its “boldest innovation yet”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The details are complex, but effectively Sequoia is asking investors to transfer the huge gains they have made on companies such as <strong>Airbnb</strong> and <strong>DoorDash</strong> into a new fund that will hold the firm's public stock positions, DD's Miles Kruppa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df18026-6af8-4380-96b6-c57dd5c8426e\">writes</a>. </p> <p>That vehicle, <strong>The Sequoia Fund</strong>, will become a semi-permanent pot of money for Sequoia's traditional venture funds focused on US and European start-ups, and investors will only be able to commit funding to the overarching pool of capital.</p> <p><strong>Roelof Botha</strong>, head of Sequoia's US and European business, is spearheading the changes, underlining the rising profile of the South African investor at the 40-year-old firm.</p> <p>Sequoia is meeting with investors this week to convince them of the new structure. If any venture capital firm can get away with such a drastic swerve, it's the group named after Northern California's marquee tree species.</p> <p>On top of adding complexity, the fund structure will impose extra fees on Sequoia's blue-chip roster of endowment and foundation investors. </p> <p>In return, investors will be able to redeem their money twice a year after an initial two-year lock-up period, an unusually frequent cadence that is more typical of hedge funds. Effectively, Sequoia is betting that investors will be afraid of missing out on the next big portfolio company and mostly sit tight.</p> <p>With $45bn in public stock holdings on just $2bn of invested capital, Sequoia seems to think investors will have little reason to doubt its skill.</p> <h2>Entain/DraftKings: three's a crowd</h2> <p>When US gambling group <strong>DraftKings</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/613a232a-5a77-4e58-a3b2-4a3af69af88f\">announced it was making a play</a> for UK rival <strong>Entain </strong>in September, odds of the two companies getting a deal to the finish line didn't seem particularly high.</p> <p>Anyone betting on that outcome would've made a lot of money. </p> <p>The Boston-based group said on Tuesday that it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae1b143f-3735-488b-a510-37f77f2dddf9\">walking away</a> from the deal just one week after it secured an extension to a “put up or shut up” deadline from the UK Takeover Panel. </p> <p>While the £28 a share offer seemed compelling — at least enough for Entain to consider it having previously rejected an advance from DraftKings at £25 a share — there was another wrinkle in the deal. </p> <p>Entain has a 50-50 venture with <strong>MGM</strong>, which directly competes with DraftKings. The US casino operator made it clear from the get go that it would need to have a seat at the table as the companies hashed out a deal. </p> <p><strong>BetMGM</strong>, created in 2018, is a lucrative source of income for Entain and MGM. The venture has taken significant market share in the US and is projecting $1bn in revenue next year, up from $178m in 2020, with operations in 20 states.</p> <p>MGM wasn't going to let that slip away. In fact, its chief executive <strong>Bill Hornbuckle</strong> has said the company had regrets about giving up half of BetMGM and would like to take control of it. </p> <p>Untangling that partnership would've been extremely complex with sources telling DD that MGM was bound to extract its pound of flesh after it had itself sought to acquire Entain at the start of the year for £8bn — less than half DraftKings' offer. </p> <p>As companies in the sector rush to consolidate to seize on the rapid growth of sports betting and online gambling in the US, Entain may not have a lot of options as long as its partnership with MGM continues. </p> <p>But maybe it doesn't need any. As <strong>Wes McCoy</strong>, investment director at <strong>Abrdn*</strong>, a key shareholder in Entain, said: “There is nothing that Entain doesn't have that DraftKings has [and] that I want.”</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>SoftBank</strong>'s<strong> Andreas Hansson</strong> will join the board of <strong>THG </strong>as a non-executive director amid the ecommerce group's attempt to regain investor confidence. <strong>THG</strong> will also move its listing to the premium rather than standard segment of the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>. THG shares fell 21 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea3565cb-dd5c-445c-b9d7-80ca19bff9ec\">on the news</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Lazard</strong> has hired <strong>Luba Kotzeva de Diaz</strong> as a managing director in investment banking focused on energy and renewables. She joins from <strong>Rothschild</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cecilio Madero</strong>, a former top official in the European Commission's competition division, is leaving law firm <strong>Clifford Chance</strong> after just six months on the job for “personal reasons”, according to an internal memo. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has hired<strong> Bruce Hart</strong> as head of investment banking for Africa. He joins from <strong>Standard Bank </strong>and will be based in Johannesburg. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Whistleblower, part 2: </strong>On Tuesday we featured a NYT piece on the strange press strategy of the Facebook whistleblower.
