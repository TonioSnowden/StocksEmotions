  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>Long-delayed <strong>due diligence obligations</strong> for companies ignoring environmental harm or human rights abuses in their supply chains are inching towards the starting line. We'll unpack the main elements of the draft proposals ahead of their publication by the European Commission in mid-February.</p> <p>In Rome, a conclave of lawmakers and regional representatives is starting the papal-like process of electing <strong>Italy's new president</strong>, with Mario Draghi touted as favourite. We'll explore the stakes — and the risk that financial markets become jittery if the new government starts flip-flopping on reforms.</p> <p>With EU foreign ministers gathering in Brussels today to discuss Russia sanctions in case of an attack on Ukraine — joined virtually by their US counterpart — we'll also look at what <strong>Sweden and Finland</strong>'s separate meeting with the Nato secretary-general is signalling. (Here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3510f7cb-294f-4783-969b-34f391e73b66\">the FT's take</a> on why divisions within the west this time have been laid bare more than usual.)</p> <h2>Supply chain under scrutiny</h2> <p>One of the more vexed and contested proposals in the commission's legislative portfolio is getting closer to its debut, write <em><strong>Sam Fleming, Mehreen Khan and Andy Bounds in Brussels. </strong></em>&#xa0;</p> <p>Proposals for rules on sustainable corporate governance, which were knocked back twice last year by the commission's internal regulatory scrutiny board, are tentatively scheduled for release in the middle of February. </p> <p>The commission has yet to finalise the provisions, but under the current draft large companies could find themselves taken to court if they fail to do enough to crack down on human rights or environmental abuses in their supply chains, according to people familiar with the discussions. </p> <p>The rules would apply to companies with more than 500 employees and €150m of annual revenues. There may be an additional category for “high-risk” sectors such as mining, which apply to 250-500 employees. Smaller companies would be exempt. </p> <p>The mooted regime, which is being spearheaded by Didier Reynders, the justice commissioner, has had a fraught genesis. Earlier ideas, including the possibility of forcing companies to withdraw certain non-compliant products from the single market, have not made it into the latest draft — although there is plenty of scope for things to change. </p> <p>Reynders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a39c68b-dcd1-4aa9-8fec-7ab379bd9700\">told</a> the FT this month that the commission will come forward with an “ambitious proposal on due diligence, concerning environmental issues and human rights issues” — with the goal of landing the proposals in the first quarter of the year. </p> <p>“We will start with large companies — we don't want to put too many burdens on SMEs,” he said. </p> <p>Members of the European parliament have been pushing hard for tighter rules, in part because of concerns over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/748a837b-ac51-4f2e-9a5d-3af780ec8444\">the use of forced labour</a> in China's Xinjiang region. Member states including Germany and the Netherlands have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b969d2c-ad1e-48c2-b318-2dd20bb1662f\">moving forward</a> with their own regimes. </p> <p>The legislation would allow companies to be taken to court by injured parties if they fail to meet the required due diligence standards, while also permitting EU member states to introduce financial penalties. Companies would need to show they have properly examined risks in their supply chains. </p> <p>The commission declined to comment on the details of the proposals, which are also being overseen by Vera Jourova, commission vice-president.</p> <p>Heidi Hautala, a Finnish Green MEP, said that without access to justice for victims of abuses covered by the directive the instrument would have almost no meaning. “It is something real, if the companies have to do everything in their power to identify the salient risks in the supply chain and work on those risks,” she said.</p> <p>Business groups, while backing an EU-wide framework, have expressed concerns about the proposals. “The new rules should not task European companies with solving problems out of their scope, mixing up the roles of companies and governments,” said BusinessEurope, which represents the bloc's large employers.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: Mountain of debt</h1> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8478096.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><em>Mario Draghi's leadership and the political support for his plan to reboot the economy helped assuage longstanding concerns in financial markets about the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/462699a0-99fd-4f33-9374-34c4962676db\"><em>sustainability of Italy's debts</em></a><em>, which now exceed 150 per cent of GDP. </em></p> <h2>It's the markets, stupid</h2> <p>Italy's political cauldron starts frothing in earnest today as MPs, senators and regional representatives begin voting on who will succeed Sergio Mattarella as president of the republic, writes <em><strong>Sam Fleming.</strong></em></p> <p>The central question is whether the vote propels Mario Draghi into the Quirinale palace from his current role of prime minister, which he assumed last February, and, if so, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/462699a0-99fd-4f33-9374-34c4962676db\">who will replace him</a>. </p> <p>The political ferment is being watched extremely closely in Brussels. Draghi, the former European Central Bank president, enjoys enviable credibility in the European Commission thanks most recently to his deft handling of Italy's bid for €191bn in grants and loans under the NextGenerationEU recovery programme. </p> <p>The risk is that his successor will start to struggle to deliver on all the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a2db949-c958-46cf-88a4-86db99beef4d\">reforms</a> and investments needed to meet agreed milestones in the Italian recovery plan, jeopardising the flow of cash that is heading Italy's way. </p> <p>While the NextGenerationEU scheme runs until 2026, the Italian recovery plan was built to front-load reforms and disbursements, in part on the expectation that Draghi would serve in the Chigi palace until 2023. </p> <p>The consequences of failing to deliver on agreed reforms are serious: payments could be withheld or even forfeited. Given the political uproar that would follow such a situation, both sides are incentivised to keep the cash flowing. </p> <p>The bigger risk, some officials fear, may be less that Italy falls foul of the commission, but rather that it gets back into trouble with the financial markets. Its structural reform programme includes a range of nettlesome topics including civil justice, public administration, tax and procurement. If Italy falls short, market faith in the country's growth outlook could start to wane. </p> <p>A new government would also face mounting pressure to hand out tax cuts and extra spending with general elections looming by summer 2023. All this would endanger Rome's plans for reining in public borrowing — a topic that is going to take on even greater urgency given EU plans to reimpose the EU's suspended Stability and Growth Pact in 2023, as well as the European Central Bank's ambitions to gradually dial back sovereign debt purchases.</p> <p>The commission <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b77010a3-a3bc-4585-a9be-79f761099810\">raised</a> a warning flag in November, pronouncing that Rome had not sufficiently limited the growth of its current expenditure in its 2022 budget given its debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 150 per cent. </p> <h2>Nordic-Nato flirt</h2> <p>The foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland meet Nato's secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels today, only the latest in a series of diplomatic flirtations between the military alliance and its two most notable northern European non-members, writes <em><strong>Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent.</strong></em></p> <p>The governments in both Stockholm and Helsinki as well as everyone from US president Joe Biden down on the Nato side have repeatedly stressed in the past few weeks that Finland and Sweden, and they alone, have the right to seek membership of the military alliance. That came after Russia's foreign ministry broke the Christmas spirit by warning on December 24 that if either country joined Nato there would be “serious military and political consequences”.</p> <p>Both Finland and Sweden are well known for their long periods of neutrality but that stance has changed in recent years, first by signing up to the EU with its weak mutual defence clause, and then in recent years by becoming perhaps the most significant and closest partners with Nato.</p> <p>A decade ago, it was notable that then Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen pointedly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/421497d0-b3ef-11e2-ace9-00144feabdc0\">warned</a> Sweden that only full membership of the alliance would confer full benefits. Now, US and Nato officials are full of praise for the two countries and hint that any application would both be warmly welcomed and potentially rapidly approved.</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that Sweden's Ann Linde and Finland's Pekka Haavisto meet Stoltenberg today. Neither Linde nor Haavisto are currently in favour of Nato membership, and there is far from political unity in either country. But there is a sense that a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine could further change the situation.
