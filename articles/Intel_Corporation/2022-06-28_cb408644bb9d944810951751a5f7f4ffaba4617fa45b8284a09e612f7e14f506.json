  "title": "U.S. News: Silicon-Wafer Factory Planned for Texas --- Taiwan-based firm says it will build plant if it receives incentives from stalled Chips Act",
  "text": "<p>But company executives said the plant will require financial incentives included in the Chips Act, which is aimed at increasing chip production in the U.S. and is part of legislation that House and Senate leaders have been debating for months.</p><p>\"If the Chips Act is not passed, we have to pivot to South Korea,\" said the company's president, Mark England, who said costs there would be substantially less.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the situation points to the urgent need to pass the legislation, noting that South Korea, Japan and members of the European Union are all offering hefty subsidies to ensure stable supplies of chips that power consumer, industrial and military products amid a global shortage. \"We are really at a tipping point right now in the semiconductor supply chain,\" Ms. Raimondo said.</p><p>The Chips Act would provide roughly $52 billion to build up the U.S. semiconductor industry, but the funding has been tied down as Senate and House leaders try to resolve differences between a broader Senate bill passed last year as the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and the House version called the America Competes Act.</p><p>Democrats have cast the legislation as the centerpiece of their efforts to rein in inflation for American consumers, contending that its funding could help control soaring prices for many items including automobiles that have been affected by semiconductor shortages.</p><p>The Senate version was passed with bipartisan support last year, but the House bill was approved on a party-line vote with measures on trade, climate change and human rights that Republicans oppose.</p><p>\"Although I hope to see significant progress soon, we should not rush the conference process to meet arbitrary and politically motivated deadlines,\" Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, said recently.</p><p>The growing doubts about the legislation last week led Intel Corp. to tell lawmakers and officials that it was indefinitely delaying a groundbreaking ceremony for a planned multibillion-dollar chip-manufacturing facility in Ohio. The move signaled the industry's frustration over uncertainty in Congress about the legislation.</p><p>Intel still plans to build the facility and hasn't pushed back the start of construction, said Intel spokesman Will Moss.</p><p>Democratic leaders insist they have made significant concessions.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) suggested last week that Republicans are trying to drag out House-Senate negotiations over the legislation in hopes of denying Democrats a win on the economy ahead of the November midterm elections. \"The real question is, do the Republicans in the Senate really want America to be independent?\" Mrs. Pelosi said Friday.</p>",
