  "title": "Intel  Issues  Apology  To China  On Furor  ----  By Liza Lin",
  "text": "<p>\n  U.S. semiconductor maker Intel Corp. apologized following a social-media backlash over a letter it sent suppliers asking them to avoid sourcing from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has conducted a campaign of forcible assimilation against religious minorities. </p><p>\n  In a letter to global suppliers, dated this month and published in several languages on its website, Intel called on its business partners to steer clear of the remote northwestern region of China, noting that \"multiple governments have imposed restrictions on products sourced from the Xinjiang region. Therefore, Intel is required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.\" </p><p>\n  Even though its guidance was little changed from what the company previously told suppliers, by midweek the letter had been singled out by irate Chinese social-media users and a nationalist state-run tabloid, denouncing Intel's unwillingness to conduct business involving Xinjiang. </p><p>\n  On Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker said its letter was written only to comply with U.S. law and didn't represent Intel's stance on Xinjiang. \"We deeply apologize for the confusion caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,\" Intel said on its social-media platforms in China. Intel didn't specify which law it was seeking to comply with. </p><p>\n  The incident is the latest example of multinational companies caught in the middle as Western governments pressure companies to disentangle their supply chains from Xinjiang. Sportswear company Adidas AG and fast-fashion company H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB are among those that have run afoul of social-media users in China. Those that have apologized to Chinese consumers, meanwhile, risk a backlash from lawmakers and consumers back home. </p><p>\n  The Intel letter was published in the U.S. on Dec. 16, the same day that the U.S. Senate passed legislation banning imports from the Xinjiang region over concerns about the use of forced labor. President Biden signed the bill, titled the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, into law on Thursday. </p><p>\n  The U.S. and other Western governments have sought to punish Beijing over its policies toward Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, which U.S. government officials, lawmakers and human-rights activists have said amount to genocide. </p><p>\n  It also comes just weeks ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Intel is one of 14 global companies that have contracts with the International Olympic Committee to sponsor multiple Olympics. Human-rights groups have put pressure on Olympic sponsors to speak up on human rights or pull out ahead of the Beijing Games, which are slated to begin Feb. 4. </p><p>\n  Intel's latest supplier guidance on Xinjiang is similar to what the company said in last year's letter to vendors, when it instructed them to \"ensure Intel does not receive goods/services produced in the Xinjiang region of China.\" At a congressional hearing over the summer, Intel General Counsel Steve Rodgers said the company had no goods sourced from the Chinese region and put in place policies to prohibit suppliers being added from there. </p><p>\n  Researchers say China's government has detained as many as one million members of mostly Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps as part of a campaign of forcible assimilation that also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls. </p><p>\n  China's government has rejected those allegations, portraying its campaign in Xinjiang as an innovative effort to fight religious extremism and terrorism. </p><p>\n  Later Thursday, Intel said it had posted its apology in China \"to address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network.\" The company said it would ensure its sourcing complies with relevant rules wherever it operates. </p><p>\n  China was Intel's largest market by revenue from 2018 to 2020. The company, in its latest annual report, said it had around $20 billion in revenue linked to sales in the country, or about 26% of that year's total. Some of those sales are to customers who then export their goods from China. Intel also maintains several offices in China and a chip assembly-and-test facility in Chengdu. </p><p>\n  While a boycott against foreign apparel brands leaves Chinese consumers with a plethora of domestic offerings, in Intel's case, there aren't any clear-cut Chinese alternatives. Any Chinese crackdown on Intel chip imports could have big implications for the country's own industry. The U.S. semiconductor company has a more than 80% market share in so-called CPU chips for desktop personal computers, the brains of the PC. It is also a dominant vendor of such processors for data services, supplying such Chinese companies as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. </p><p>\n   In an unsigned editorial published after Intel's supplier letter began to circulate, China's state-run Global Times tabloid criticized the company for offending the Chinese people. The paper said Intel's actions were aimed at improving its own standing before the U.S. government and called on Beijing to make it \"increasingly expensive for companies to offend China.\" </p><p>\n  The editorial also urged China to speed up the localization of its chip supplies. </p><p>\n  Karry Wang, a singer with the popular Chinese boy band TFBoys, said Wednesday that he would step down as brand ambassador for Intel over the matter. \"National interests trumps everything,\" the celebrity's management office posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Robert Wall contributed to this article. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Communist Party </p><p>\n  Amplifies Outrage </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In China, it is hard to tell how organic social-media firestorms are, as Chinese authorities and technology companies heavily censor and moderate discussions within the country. </p><p>\n  Researchers of social-media trends and disinformation analyzing Chinese activity have found Communist Party-run news outlets often amplify nationalist Chinese social-media campaigns. When H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz and sports-apparel maker Nike Inc. faced a backlash earlier in the year over their expressions of concern about forced labor in Xinjiang, researchers in Taiwan found state-media outlets and Communist Party-affiliated social-media accounts fanning the flames of anger online. </p><p>\n  Earlier this year, H&amp;M was wiped off China's internet after the Swedish company said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang. A Chinese consumer boycott followed, costing the fashion company some $74 million in lost sales in China for the three months ended May 31. </p><p>\n  Other consumer brands, including Adidas and Nike, also suffered a decline in China sales after joining a consortium of Western brands that raised concerns over alleged forced-labor practices in Xinjiang. </p><p>\n  By late Thursday, Intel Corp.'s apology was among Weibo's top trending topics, with more than 340 million views. The issue drew comments from users who criticized the American chip maker for what they described as Intel's lack of sincerity. </p><p></p>",
