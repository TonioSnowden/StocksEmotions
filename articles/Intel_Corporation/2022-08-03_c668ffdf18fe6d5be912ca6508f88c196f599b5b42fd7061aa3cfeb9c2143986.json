  "text": "<p>Jacqueline Kennedy and H.F. du Pont: From Winterthur to the White House</p><p>Winterthur Museum, Garden &amp; Library Through Jan. 8, 2023</p><p>Astronauts were in the air. Jackie's husband, President John F. Kennedy, would go before Congress just 16 days later to ask for $7 billion for the space program, money meant to land a man on the moon. Assessing her new home with a critical eye, the First Lady decided on her own space program—interior space. The historic rooms of the White House did not inspire, particularly the jewel-toned State Parlors. \"I always felt the three rooms were too strong—Hard red—Hard blue—Hard green,\" she said. The word \"hard\" is perfect. The rooms were stiff and charmless.</p><p>Jackie was a Democrat; Du Pont, a Republican. She was a Francophile; he was the last word on historical American furniture and decorative arts. She was the tender age of 31; he was 80. A half-century stood between them, but the First Lady knew what she needed and took herself to Winterthur, the fabled Delaware estate where Du Pont was born and which he'd since turned into a museum with gardens, a library, and a scholarly program in Early American Culture. With archival items, furniture and textiles, 97 objects in all, \"Jacqueline Kennedy and H.F. du Pont: From Winterthur to the White House\" tells the story of Jackie and Henry's venture. This exhibition at Winterthur is not only poignant, it is a lovely respite from the vicious political division of today.</p><p>Organized by guest curator Elaine Rice Bachmann, an archivist who has written extensively on the restoration, the show opens with a tableau that sees two CBS TK-11 broadcast cameras focused on a red wool suit—a reproduction of the Chez Ninon that Jackie Kennedy wore on Jan. 15, 1962, the day her tour of the refreshed White House was filmed for television (it was aired a month later). \"It just seemed to me such a shame when we came here,\" she explained to viewers, \"to find hardly anything of the past in the house. Hardly anything before 1902.\" When asked about her budget, she said, \"It's small, because everything we do is by private donation.\" No moon-bound billions here.</p><p>Du Pont would chair Mrs. Kennedy's Fine Arts Committee for the White House (she was honorary chairman), and he also formed an Advisory Committee filled with eminent museum curators from around the country. A whole wall is given over to their telegrams and letters of acceptance. The beginning of this exhibition is text heavy, as it must be, for it establishes context. Once we get to the rooms, details of design take over.</p><p>Du Pont was tasked with rounding up period antiques for the rooms—sideboards, pier tables, sofas, chairs, desks, mirrors, porcelain—as donations, loans, or at a nominal price. \"With the exception of a pair of Sheraton side chairs,\" he said after his first visit, \"the furniture in the White House is modern and very uninteresting.\" Two interior decorators were part of the project: for the family rooms Sister Parish, known for WASP chic, slightly homespun; and for the public rooms Stéphane Boudin, highhanded principal of the Parisian firm Maison Jansen. Each in their own way took liberties. Attempting to keep things as correct as possible, Du Pont was a kind of design conscience.</p><p>Take the first room to be redone, the Green Room. On Du Pont's advice it was reconceived as an intimate American Federal parlor. He insisted that the curtains be set within the window molding, and when you see that window treatment here you understand how right he was. The Federal swags and tassels are contained, crisp, and scaled to conversation. The \"hard\" shade of green, however, was an issue for everyone. The Scalamandré damask of the Truman presidency leaned teal. Boudin muted the green in 1963, bringing in a mossy silk moiré for the walls and curtains. In the process, he added medieval pelmets to the windows, smothering the moldings in a French fairy tale.</p><p>The Red Room, redone as American and French Empire, was softened to cerise—a glowing pinkish red. Jackie pushed back against Henry in this room, bringing in more French furniture (\"as long as it has the eagle,\" she wrote him, \"it doesn't matter if it's French\"). But otherwise simplicity prevailed. The curtains had a flat trim and no tiebacks; anything fancier would be too expensive and too tempting for souvenir hunters with scissors. A vitrine holds samples of the extravagant red-gold tiebacks and bullion fringe added by the Nixon administration.</p><p>Ah, the Blue Room, an oval space situated between Green and Red, the centerpiece of the State Rooms. Funded entirely by Charles and Jayne Wrightsman, who gave Boudin carte blanche, it was recast as pure French Empire with Malmaison ivory stripes on the walls and windows with blue silk curtains. This was Boudin's baby and the shade of blue—the milky hue of French opaline—was deeply . . . not American. He trimmed it in red-and-cream galloon and ran a tasseled valance around the room like good old State Fair bunting. Boudin's \"masterpiece,\" Mrs. Kennedy called it. Du Pont is not on record with a comment, but is said to have muttered under his breath whenever he entered the room.</p><p>The work of Du Pont and his committee continued into the President's Dining Room, the Family Dining Room and the Oval Office, and was mostly finished by fall 1963. The president himself chose the color scheme of red, white and blue for his office, but never saw it. The room was completed while he and his wife were in Dallas. Two months earlier, Jackie had written to Henry: \"Dear Mr. du Pont, Don't you know that everything that is lovely in The White House—is all your contribution; who could possibly have made a greater one?\"</p><p>Ms. Jacobs is the Arts Intel Report editor for the weekly newsletter Air Mail.</p><p>'From Winterthur to the White House' Review: More Than Just Wallpaper</p>",
