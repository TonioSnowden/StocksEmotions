The FT's Tim Bradshaw unpacks it all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cf0cec0-7774-428f-ae83-5bd6479ae9f6\">here</a>.</p> <p>Why it matters: one of the disclosures about Lynch specifies that he served on Darktrace's advisory council until last month, the FT's Kadhim Shubber <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5302ce7c-2d58-4e8b-843e-a181ee3a2bd1\">reports</a>, contradicting what the company told the FT a few years ago — that he had stepped down from that body in 2017.</p> <p>Invoke said Lynch had indeed ceased to be on the council in 2017 as a practical matter, and suggested the paperwork had only been finalised during the IPO process.</p> <p>Darktrace said that it had now fully separated from Invoke, and that while Lynch served on its “science and technology council” and remained, together with his wife, a major shareholder with a combined 19 per cent stake, he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.</p> <p>Confusion surrounding Lynch aside, the start-up has a decent shot at a successful listing.</p> <p>Sales were $200m in the year to June 2020, losses were $26.9m, and its customers across 100 countries rose to 4,600 at the end of last year, up from about 1,600 in 2018, suggesting that the business is scaleable.</p> <p>Its software is quick to deploy and could generate predictable, recurring revenue as long as its sales team — who account for almost three-quarters of its staff — can pull it off.</p> <h2>Ma's reappearing act leaves mystery in its wake</h2> <p>“A miracle is happening,” Jack Ma declared on October 24, commanding the global business stage in Shanghai before many of China's senior-most officials.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bankers watched on in awe, salivating at the prospect of <strong>Ant Group</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/a331c838-8bd7-4e79-8966-eb9f012743aa\">$37bn dual listing</a> on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, “the biggest IPO in human history”. The charismatic entrepreneur always knows how to put on a good show.</p> <p>But his raucous speech had also reverberated to the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist party, and the country's President <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> didn't like what he heard.</p> <p>It was the last time he would be seen in public for months, his disappearance feeding rumours that China's most famous celebrity billionaire was under house arrest, or had fled to Singapore.&#xa0;</p> <p>The uncertainty was weighing on <strong>Alibaba</strong>'s stock price and a plan to sell billions of dollars worth of bonds to foreign investors.</p> <p>Ma's resurfacing would illustrate just how quick and brutal his fall from grace has been, as the FT's Ryan McMorrow and Sun Yu chronicle in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fe0559f-de6d-490e-b312-abba0181da1f\">deep dive</a> into the billionaire's political plight.</p> <p>To quell investor concern, Ma's team planned a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3e0ab4a-6362-4b58-99b3-23185b9a1cd4\">reappearance video</a>: the Alibaba founder ventured hours into the Chinese countryside with a camera crew to capture a visit to a school his charity supported.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because it had to be low-profile, they picked a Sunday, when no children were present, and didn't notify the teachers. “Things have not been so smooth for him lately, so he doesn't want to appear publicly,” recalled principal <strong>Chen Jianqiang</strong>.</p> <p>The reckoning was only a matter of time, Ryan explains in a dispatch from Beijing.</p> <p>Ma's cult-like following built up over years brought him unrivalled influence for a Chinese businessman. He jet-setted around the world, regularly attending Davos and mingling with countless world leaders, all the while upstaging top officials in Beijing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cautionary tales of Ma's once-powerful peers — such as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1394c92-aee4-11e7-aab9-abaa44b1e130\">real estate magnate</a> <strong>Wang Jianlin</strong>, who has fallen silent while shrinking his businesses, and <strong>Anbang</strong> insurance tycoon <strong>Wu Xiaohui</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20e05718-8da3-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37\">ended up in jail</a> — did not appear to deter him in his quest.</p> <p>But ultimately, Ma became too powerful in a country that only allows a single centre of power: the Communist party.</p> <p>Now Ma's future remains unclear. “As a private entrepreneur it's very important to find the right degree of publicity and Ma hasn't yet mastered this. It didn't matter before. Now it is necessary to start learning,” says a former official in Hangzhou who dealt with Alibaba for a decade.&#xa0;</p> <h2>LVMH brings that certain ‘je ne sais quois'</h2> <p><strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, the tough-negotiating <strong>LVMH</strong> boss (semi) affectionately referred to in dealmaking circles as the “wolf in cashmere”, may just treat himself to some new knitwear.</p> <p>The French house has proven to investors that the only baggage it carries is that of luxury leather, its market value closing at nearly €300bn this week. Cue the toasts of <strong>Moët &amp; Chandon</strong>.</p> <p>Much of its unstoppable rise, which, as Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1b5a35a-e00c-43e5-b0ae-01a29d87a470\">points out</a>, proves an exception to the rule that conglomerates are démodé, can be attributed to some very savvy M&amp;A.</p> <p>DD regulars will of course remember the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dca6fd2a-a42b-4705-8d48-486a2ab0916b\">$16.6bn soap opera</a> before it finally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a37cda3-1ec2-4726-8ab2-cd867eb2f44c\">tied the knot</a> with <strong>Tiffany</strong>, and its recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/840826e8-a70e-4f1d-82a4-1b83895eced5\">champagne deal</a> with <strong>Jay-Z</strong>. Arnault also has a knack for reviving undervalued brands such as <strong>Christian Dior</strong>.</p> <p>But it also heavily relies on its luggage label, <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong>. The business accounts for half of group operating profits and 60 per cent of its overall value, according to <strong>Citigroup</strong>.</p> <p>So while its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c892b85-9ae2-4ef9-8e42-9a09baf3492b\">first-quarter results</a> proved exceptionally strong, DD will be on the lookout for more deals as the wolf continues to diversify his empire.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong> has hired <strong>Paul Morrissey</strong> as a managing director in London to lead investing across Europe for Blackstone Growth. He most recently served as a partner at <strong>Battery Ventures</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Paul Kwan</strong>, the former head of west coast tech banking at<strong> Morgan Stanley</strong>, has joined <strong>General Catalyst</strong> as a managing director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Simpson Thacher</strong> has hired <strong>Marc Berger</strong>, most recently the acting director of the <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>'s enforcement division, as a partner in its litigation department.
