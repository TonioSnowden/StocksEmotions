They fear exposure to the coronavirus or worry they might have to stay home to care for their kids, especially if new strains of the coronavirus emerge and shut down schools again.</p><p>The increase in the size of the labor force in November was good news, but it remains to be seen if the uptrend is sustained.</p><p>Read:U.S. consumer confidence sinks to 9-month low on inflation and Covid worries</p><p>Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&amp;P500 SPX were set to open higher in Friday trades.
