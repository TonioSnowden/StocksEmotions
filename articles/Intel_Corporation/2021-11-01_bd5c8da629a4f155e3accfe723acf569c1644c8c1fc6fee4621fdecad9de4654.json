  "text": "<p>Robert Armstrong's article “Bond's suits: the Spectre of tight tailoring” (Life &amp; Arts, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4d97d6-d54f-4606-b62a-235f0c85ef5a\">FT Weekend</a>, October 23) was reassuring. I have always taken pride in my appearance, even winning “best dressed in high school” — admittedly a dubious achievement. </p> <p>I believe it was my traditional tailoring that helped me gain admission to Cornell University and the various law firms I worked for during law school. By the time I started my Wall Street career at Salomon Brothers when it was still a partnership, I had learned the value of appearances in the professional world. </p> <p>So to me, the way Daniel Craig as James Bond wore his suit, looking as if he had outgrown it 10 years ago, was foolish. Fortunately fashion changes and I hope this constricting style is soon history. </p> <p>For I think the only people who benefit from such ill-fitting attire are the manufacturers that save on the cost of the cloth to produce such garments. Time to let out the seams and look the part 007! </p> <p><strong>Steven A Ludsin</strong> <br><em>East Hampton, NY, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: It's time 007 let out the seams and looked the part' FT.com 1 November.
