  "text": "<p>Pat Gelsinger, who became the chip company's chief executive last year, has been trying to remake Intel through steps such as investing in new chip-making factories and bolstering its engineering team. Intel last month agreed to buy Israeli chip company Tower Semiconductor Ltd. for nearly $6 billion. The moves have failed to boost its share price, though, amid concerns the spending will weigh on results in the near-term.</p><p>On Monday, Intel said it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering. Intel has said it expected the listing to take place in mid-2022 and that it expects to retain a majority share.</p><p>The Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker said it hasn't yet determined the number of shares to be offered or the expected price range.</p><p>The Mobileye filing submitted to the SEC isn't yet visible to the public because the company has taken advantage of the commonly used confidential-filing provision introduced in 2012 as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.</p><p>General Motors Co. could follow a similar path with its Cruise autonomous-car division, RBC Capital has said. The car maker hasn't detailed its plans.</p><p>The protracted global chip shortage that has hit car makers hard has led to closer ties between auto and chip companies. Ford Motor Co. last year announced a strategic agreement with GlobalFoundries Inc. to develop chips, and GM said it would team up with Qualcomm Inc. to co-develop and manufacture chips.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger has said the appetite of the auto industry for processors is making it a more critical customer segment for semiconductor companies</p><p>Mobileye had about $1.4 billion in revenue in 2021, roughly 40% higher than the prior year, the unit's CEO, Amnon Shashua, said in January. The company has enjoyed strong demand for its technology, he said, with a pipeline of about 50 million vehicles for its equipment at the start of the year, up from around 37 million vehicles in 2020.</p><p>Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Intel Files to Take Self-Driving Unit Mobileye Public</p>",
