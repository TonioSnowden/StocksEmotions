  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA retreated 287 points, or 0.8%, to 35,684.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 0.7%, or 32 points, to 4,679, losing grip on a psychologically significant level at 4,700.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was trading 1.1%, or 170 points, lower at 15,458.</p><p>Last week, each of the major indexes rose about 4%, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its 67th record high of 2021 on Friday.

We are far from that point.”</p><p>Besides the week's flurry of central bank decisions, which also will include the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, markets also will be focused on coronavirus headlines. The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. was headed toward 50 million on Monday, and the number of deaths was close to 800,000, as New Yorkers kicked off the week with a new face mask mandate for all indoor public places.Want intel on all the news moving markets?
