  "text": "<p>Hargreaves Lansdown is emerging a winner from the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd6c7674-d0ed-4865-82ed-48ee169bc6cc\">retail trading frenzy</a>&#xa0;that has swept Wall Street, with the investment broker saying current year profit will be “modestly above the top end of analyst expectations”.</p> <p>Volumes of share dealing have remained elevated since its last update at the end of January, with “an increased proportion of these directed towards international equities, driven by interest in US stocks from existing clients,” Hargreaves said in an unscheduled update.&#xa0; </p> <p>Company-collected analyst expectations for its fiscal year ending June are for pre-tax profit of £334m to £360m, compared with underlying profit of £339.5m in 2020.</p> <p>“As we saw with the IG and Winterflood results, retail stock trading is in full swing,” said Numis Securities analyst James Hamilton. “We are increasingly of the opinion that a part of the increased stock trading by customers is structural, driven by working from home and what we believe has now, after a year, become more of an embedded activity.”</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>SSP</strong>, the travel café operator, set out plans to raise £475m with a fully underwritten rights issue. The company also said it had agreed new covenant waivers from its lenders and extended debt facilities due to expire in July 2022 out to January 2024. SSP targeted like-for-like revenue returning to 2019 levels in its 2024 financial years. Cash burn is expected to remain at £25m to £30m a month with revenue in the six months to March 2021 down around 80 per cent versus the equivalent period in 2019, it said.</p> <p><strong>Capita</strong> said it wants to raise £700m from disposals, including £500m in the current financial year, as it restructures around two divisions: public service and “customer experience markets”. The outsourcer posted a £49.4m pre-tax loss for 2020, a 21 per cent improvement on its £62.6m loss in 2019 and in line with previous guidance. Management targeted a return to organic revenue growth this year with “sustainable cash generation” in 2022.</p> <p><strong>BT</strong> and <strong>Vodafone</strong> were among the winners in the latest round of UK spectrum auctions to support 5G mobile. Regulator Ofcom said it had raised a total of £1.36bn, with all four main networks securing new licences. BT's EE mobile network agreed to buy two tranches of spectrum for £280m and £168m while Vodafone secured a single tranche for £176.4m. </p> <p>Funeral home operator <strong>Dignity</strong> posted a £19.6m loss for 2020 because of Covid-19 restrictions. The pandemic directly contributed to a 14 per cent increase in the total UK 2020 annual death-toll of 663,000, Dignity said. But a “constricted service offering” meant lower revenue per funeral so operating profit fell 65 per cent to £15.9m, in spite of a 5 per cent improvement in revenue to £357.5m. Dignity's root and branch review of operations in response to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/105e4abb-2ed1-468d-b80c-dfe08f84167d\">Competition and Markets Authority report</a> into the sector is scheduled to conclude in the second quarter of 2021.</p> <p><strong>Ferrexpo</strong>, the Ukrainian mining group, proposed a special dividend after a surge in iron ore prices boosted underlying ebitda by 46 per cent to $859m. In light of “continued healthy prices” and its “transition” to a net cash position, Ferrexpo declared a special dividend of 39.6 cents a share, taking its total 2020 payout to a record 72.6 cents.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Lex Greensill</strong> and his family sold about $200m of shares in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1b922032-dfbe-4026-acf0-cc26be850f32\">Greensill Capital</a> in 2019, cashing out during a fundraising round led by SoftBank Vision Fund two years before the company collapsed. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40d3ab62-cfff-4275-b6c1-3f1353b8e933\">Three people with knowledge of the matter said</a> Greensill and his family were able to sell part of their stake after the giant technology fund ploughed $1.5bn into the business in 2019, valuing the company at about $3.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>From Wednesday<strong> Uber</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d39472b-12a1-4754-bb11-b9149dab2872\">reclassify its UK drivers as workers</a>, falling partly into line with last month's landmark Supreme Court ruling. The decision means Uber's roughly 70,000 UK drivers will for the first time be entitled to holiday pay equivalent to 12.07 per cent of their earnings, and to automatic enrolment in a workplace pension scheme.&#xa0;But the car-booking service said earnings will only be calculated on driver's “engaged” time in the Uber app. Any time waiting for customers would not be included, it said.</p> <p>A group of environmental NGOs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2985e18a-fdcb-4cd2-aee3-d5a0fe4cdab2\">have accused</a> US oil major <strong>Chevron</strong> of “greenwashing” in a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, providing an early test of what role the regulator will play in enforcing the Biden administration's climate goals. Earthworks, Global Witness and Greenpeace claimed&#xa0;Chevron&#xa0;misrepresents its image to the public in order to appear “climate-friendly” despite fossil fuels being at the heart of its operations. Chevron on Tuesday dismissed the complaint as “frivolous”.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>John Lewis, which last week reported its first ever annual loss and announced store closures, is betting that behavioural change among shoppers is here to stay. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c0659c8-0083-4071-baa5-0d6bcce93c0c\">retail reckoning</a> is only just beginning.</p> <p><strong>Brooke Masters</strong> <br>The reputation of Big Pharma, once seen as avaricious and anonymous, has been transformed by Covid-19. “We should now be holding pharma companies to a higher bar because they've shown us what they can do,” says one campaigner.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
