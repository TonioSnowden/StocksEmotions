Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said Wednesday.</p><p>The men are accused of being part of a drug-trafficking organization. The ring has been operating in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood and selling heroin laced with fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, said Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Michael K. Williams was found dead on Sept. 6. The drugs that the 54-year-old actor ingested were sold to him a day earlier by the organization, the U.S. attorney said.</p><p>One of the accused, Irvin Cartagena, was caught on video allegedly handing the drugs to Mr. Williams, according to a still shot from surveillance video provided by the U.S. attorney's office.</p><p>Mr. Cartagena has been charged with causing Mr. Williams's death in connection to his alleged role in the narcotics ring, according to authorities.

Officer Mora and Officer Jason Rivera, were shot Jan. 21 while responding to a call about a domestic argument in a Harlem apartment.</p><p>\"How many Wilberts and how many Jasons, how many more police officers, will have to lose their lives so that the system changes?\" Officer Mora's sister Karina Mora said at the gathering. \"New York police officers protect us, but who protects them?\"</p><p>Officer Mora's funeral came shortly after the sixth shooting this year of an NYPD officer. Two men approached and shot an off-duty police officer at a Queens traffic light as he drove to work Tuesday night, police said. Wounded in the shoulder, the officer was hospitalized in stable condition Wednesday, and two men were arrested.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
