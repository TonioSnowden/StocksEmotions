  "text": "<p>   For years, Chevron separately pursued an international arbitration case. The company argued that Ecuador's government had violated an investment treaty with the U.S., both by not upholding the liability release granted in the 1990s and later by allowing a fraudulent court verdict to stand. </p><p>   In 2018 the arbitration panel sided with Chevron. It ordered Ecuador to wipe out all consequences of the court verdict and preclude anyone from enforcing it, on grounds it was obtained fraudulently. </p><p>    Though Ecuador hasn't done this, Chevron officials point to instances where, they say, its representatives have admitted the verdict was fraudulent. </p><p>   In one, Ecuador's ambassador told the U.S. Trade Representative in a letter last July that Ecuador had been in touch with authorities in countries where plaintiffs sought to enforce what she called \"the fraudulent Lago Agrio judgment.\" </p><p>   The letter from the ambassador, Ivonne Baki, added that Ecuador didn't know what steps it could take to satisfy the arbitration order, saying its laws and international law constrained it from intervening in the court system. Efforts to reach Ms. Baki for comment were unsuccessful. </p><p>   Investors in Chevron appear to have largely ignored the judgment's potential financial impact. But its chief executive, Michael Wirth, continues to face questions about the case. </p><p>   At a virtual shareholders' meeting in May 2020, the actor Alec Baldwin told the CEO Chevron was using shareholders' money to personally attack Mr. Donziger. Mr. Wirth called Mr. Baldwin's summary of the case false and offensive, saying: \"Mr. Donziger is an adjudicated racketeer.\" </p><p>   There have been no settlement discussions since 2012. At a meeting that year, held while the damage award was temporarily doubled to $19 billion, Mr. Pate walked out after the plaintiffs' side proposed a nearly $10 billion settlement, according to Mr. Donziger. Chevron didn't dispute that account. </p><p>   Said Dylan Mefford, a California attorney who worked on the case as a Gibson Dunn associate: \"Both sides genuinely felt the others were criminals.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ryan Dube and Silvina Frydlewsky contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
