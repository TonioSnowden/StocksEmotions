  "title": "Chevron sells its California headquarters amid office downsizing, Texas expansion; Oil giant moving to smaller space, but will stay headquartered in Bay Area",
  "text": "<p>Sunset Chief Executive Alex Mehran Jr. said Chevron also signed a lease for nearly 400,000 square feet of space in a nearby office building located in Sunset's Bishop Ranch mixed-use project in San Ramon. Chevron's office space there could house about 2,000 employees after interior construction finishes in late 2023, Sunset said.</p><p>The financial terms of the sale and the lease agreement weren't disclosed. A Chevron spokesman said the current real-estate market gave the company an opportunity to downsize its office space to the size its employee base there requires.</p><p>Chevron's CVX main offices have resided in California for more than 140 years. It has housed its main offices in the greater Bay Area since the early days of its first corporate ancestor, Pacific Coast Oil Co., in 1879. It moved hundreds of employees to San Ramon in 1999, and in the early 2000s said it would become the company's headquarters.</p><p>But its presence in California has been declining for years, particularly following a reorganization that began in 2019. Some of Chevron's leadership have long wanted to move the company's headquarters to Texas, but it has held off largely because of its long history in California and its assets there, such as its Richmond, Calif., refinery, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>The science-backed strategies that will actually help you eat better.</p><p>The Texans who are moving to Illinois: armadillos.</p><p>Chevron sells its California headquarters amid office downsizing, Texas expansion</p>",
