  "title": "Exxon Mobil as COP26 play? Here's why Morgan Stanley says some of the dirtiest companies will benefit from decarbonization.",
  "text": "<p>It's a big moment for investors as well, as they try to identify the companies best positioned to take advantage of decarbonization. According to Morgan Stanley, there are four key actions that COP26 will try to secure: accelerating the phaseout of coal, curtailing deforestation, speeding up the switch electric vehicles and encouraging investment in renewables.</p><p>What's interesting about Morgan Stanley's list of companies that are set to benefit is how many rank among the world's dirtiest, including oil producers Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX and ConocoPhillips COP. For Chevron and Exxon, Morgan Stanley notes their presence in sustainable alternative fuels and carbon capture, utilization and storage, with Conoco also mentioned for carbon capture.</p><p>In fairness, the Morgan Stanley list isn't entirely fossil fuel companies. SolarEdge Technologies SEDG, Sunrun RUN, QuantumScape QS and Tesla TSLA also make the brokerage's list of overweight-rated companies that can benefit from decarbonization. Companies facing headwinds include Continental Resources CLR, Nabors Industries NBR, Ford Motor Co. F and American Airlines AAL, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Pershing SquareBill Ackman, the chief executive and founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is calling for the Federal Reserve to raise rates “as soon as possible” — and made that case to the New York Fed.
