  "text": "<p>Exxon and Chevron are predicting a multiyear upswing for the industry as oil and gas demand surges from the depths of the pandemic and investment in new production slows. The strong results have lured investors to a sector many left for dead.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector is up almost 19% so far this year while the broader S&amp;P 500 is down about 5%. Over the last 12 months, shares of the largest western oil companies have all risen dramatically, Exxon is up about 69%, Chevron is up 54%, while Shell and BP are up 38% 39%, respectively. Chevron's shares reached an all time high last week.</p><p>\"We've made great progress in 2021 and our forward plans position us to lead in cash flow and earnings growth, operating performance, and the energy transition,\" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.</p><p>The companies are benefiting from rapidly rising commodity prices as demand for some fuels, including U.S. gasoline consumption, have topped their pre-pandemic levels. Crucially for investors, many of the companies are sticking to pledges to moderate their growth and return more cash to shareholders.</p><p>Chevron said last week that it generated $21.1 billion in free cash flow in 2021, its most ever. But it isn't planning to plow most of it back into new oil and gas production, and expects its output could decline slightly in 2022. Instead, it increased its dividend by 6% and said it would buy back as much as $5 billion of its stock this year.</p><p>Exxon said it generated $48 billion in cash flow from operations in 2021, its most since 2012. Analysts expect it to raise its dividend later this year, and Exxon has said it will buy back as much as $10 billion in shares over the next 12 to 24 months.</p><p>Write to Christopher M.
