  "text": "<p> Mike Wirth, chief executive of Chevron, claims the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that “anthropogenic climate change is a real thing and that the use of fossil fuels has contributed” (“Chevron pins energy crisis on climate policy rush”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83d93bdd-659a-47b3-96bf-40884ef46a09\">Interview</a>, October 14). </p> <p>In fact what the panel's sixth assessment report last year stated was: “Fossil fuel combustion for energy, industry and land transportation are the largest contributing sectors on a 100-year timescale (high confidence)”. </p> <p>It is shocking but perhaps not surprising that some senior figures in the oil and gas industry still do not admit that fossil fuels are the main driver of climate change, while also trying to scare governments about the consequences of reduced dependence on their products. </p> <p>Perhaps the heads of other fossil fuel companies could demonstrate their commitment to a rapid and orderly transition away from oil, coal and gas by calling out Wirth and others within the industry who attempt such obfuscation? </p> <p><strong>Bob Ward</strong> <em><br>Policy and Communications Director <br>Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment London School of Economics and Political Science, London WC2, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Let's call out oil bosses who play down climate change' FT.com 18 October.
