  "title": "U.S. News: Oil Executives Face Adversarial House Panel",
  "text": "<p>All four companies said that they have long acknowledged the threat of climate change and are cutting their carbon emissions to minimize their contributions to it.</p><p>\"At Chevron, we have been very clear where we stand,\" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. \"We accept the scientific consensus: Climate change is real, and the use of fossil fuels contributes to it.\"</p><p>Democrats on the House committee said the companies publicly support climate-friendly policies and investments but privately work to derail regulations that would cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Environment, said that the American Petroleum Institute -- the industry's main lobbying group, which is funded by the companies -- is currently lobbying against Democrat-supported policies that he said would reduce emissions, including subsidies for electric vehicles and a methane tax.</p><p>\"You're funding these groups, and they're really having an impact,\" Mr. Khanna told the executives. \"Could you tell them to knock it off for the sake of the planet?\"</p><p>API president Mike Sommers responded to allegations the group was lobbying against Democrat-backed climate change policies by saying the group supports market adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy, but not through government subsidies. He said renewable energy will be unable to replace fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\"One area where experts agree is that oil and natural gas will continue to be the leading energy sources for decades to come, and it's important that we take action to reduce emissions while providing that energy,\" Mr. Sommers said.</p><p>The wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation detailed by Mr. Biden includes expanded tax credits for electric vehicles, but a methane tax was dropped after opposition from some lawmakers. The executives said they didn't always agree with every policy position taken by the industry's trade groups.</p><p>At the end of the roughly six-hour hearing, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D., N.Y.), the committee's chairwoman, said she would subpoena the companies to compel documents requested by Democrats that she said the companies hadn't provided.</p><p>Republican committee members, at times, came to the companies' defense and used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize Biden administration policies they said are causing soaring energy prices. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said the companies should increase their production to alleviate energy shortages.</p>",
