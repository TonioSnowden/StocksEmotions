  "title": "Oil Giants Turn to Carbon Storage",
  "text": "<p>Oil companies have long captured carbon from their operations, albeit mostly to produce more oil. Now they want to retool that skill as a service they can sell to heavy-polluting industries like cement and steel, burying their carbon in the ground indefinitely for a fee, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Yet critics question the environmental benefits and high cost of such projects.</p><p>Last month, Shell, Total SE and Equinor ASA launched a joint venture to store carbon in a rock formation thousands of feet beneath the seabed off the coast of Norway. The state-backed Northern Lights project is set to be the first time companies outside the oil industry will be able to pay to have their carbon gathered and stored.</p><p>Exxon has said it plans to form a new business unit to commercialize carbon capture and storage, forecasting it could become a $2 trillion market by 2040. Chevron Corp. has formed partnerships on storage projects, while BP PLC is codeveloping storage projects in the U.K. and Australia.</p><p>Oil executives' sales pitch: We will provide your energy, then take back the carbon to minimize your footprint.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage \"is becoming a business rather than just a solution,\" Maarten Wetselaar, director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, recently said, adding that the company plans to include carbon storage as \"part of an integrated energy package\" to energy customers.</p><p>Shell already captures and stores its own carbon at sites in Australia and Canada, and says it wants to develop additional commercial facilities.</p><p>The Norway project, set to start in 2024, already has waste company Fortum Oslo Varme SA and HeidelbergCement AG as customers. Shell says it has further interest from 10 other companies, including Microsoft Corp. and ArcelorMittal, although no binding contracts have been signed.</p><p>Most carbon-storage projects rely on government funding. Norway is covering about 80% of the $1.6 billion cost of the Northern Lights project, with the rest split equally between Shell, Equinor and Total.</p><p>Deployed since the 1970s, most of the 26 sites operating carbon capture today are focused on injecting carbon into wells to recover more oil, with a handful dedicated to storing carbon, according to the Global CCS Institute, a think tank that advocates the technology.</p><p>Carbon capture typically works through the use of chemicals, to which the carbon sticks, to filter out emissions from a source like fumes at a power plant.</p><p>In the early 2000s, governments saw carbon capture as a way to clean up electricity generated by fossil fuels, but the technology was held back by high costs. Recent moves by governments and companies to reduce emissions are rekindling interest in carbon capture beyond the energy industry.</p><p>A record 17 new carbon-capture projects were slated for development last year, according to the Global CCS Institute. Many are focused on hard-to-decarbonize sectors like steel and cement making, where manufacturing processes release carbon dioxide.</p><p>Some researchers say the technology isn't the most efficient way to reduce emissions. \"Transitioning energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels as well as planting trees and reducing deforestation is a much better way to address carbon emissions,\" said Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.</p>",
