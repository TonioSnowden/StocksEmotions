  "title": "Energy Companies Turn to 3-D Printing to Bypass Snarled Supply Chains; Technology is being used for replacement parts as availability of components via traditional delivery lines remains uncertain",
  "text": "<p>The imported components did arrive at Gorgon in time, but Chevron was so impressed with the manufacturing specifications produced by AdditiveNow that it acquired the intellectual property for use on future projects, accelerating its 3-D printing research-and-development efforts by a year.</p><p>\"We've learned a lot from those parts. The most important thing is that we've shown that this flexible, right part, right time digital supply-chain approach can be successful, and it can meet our needs in a sort of reactive mode,\" said Chevron manager Robert Rettew, whose materials R&amp;D portfolio includes 3-D printing.</p><p>The pandemic is giving 3-D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, a shot in the arm. Factors including extensive congestion at portsand other transportation nodes have slowed delivery of goods just as companies try to meet demand unleashed by economies reopening.</p><p>For commodities industries, one missing part can be costly if it forces operations offline. An estimate by Energy and Industrial Advisory Partners LLC puts the average cost of unplanned downtime for Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operators at about $20 million annually, rising to $50 million for larger operators.</p><p>Italian polymer printer Roboze Inc. opened an office in Houston shortly before the pandemic hit. It has since doubled its staff to about 100 globally as it tries to keep pace with demand for 3-D products from oil-and-gas companies.</p><p>\"Because of supply chain disruptions, we have significantly been growing in the order of a few folds,\" said Arash Shadravan, Roboze's energy-business development manager. Mr. Shadravan said Roboze, which co-chairs an American Petroleum Institute committee working to set industrywide 3-D printing standards, has worked with the world's five largest oil and gas operators.</p><p>Issues including cost and print speeds have constrained the 3-D printing industry, but a rise in global shipping costs and new techniques are making the technology more attractive. Freight costs have leveled off from recent peaks but remain elevated amid port congestion and shipping shortages. The Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which together move a quarter of all American imports, have begun operating around the clock to clear a backlog of dozens of ships waiting up to three weeks to dock.</p><p>\"Companies who may have tentatively taken their first steps last year are now starting to mature their interest,\" said Matthew Waterhouse, chief executive of 3-D printing firm 3D Metalforge Ltd. Earlier this year, the Australia-listed company installed a facility at the Port of Singapore, the world's largest container transshipment hub.</p><p>Mr. Waterhouse said some customers also see 3-D Printing as a way to eliminate large inventories of parts, which can be expensive to store and often become obsolete before they get used because of minimum order sizes imposed by traditional suppliers.</p><p>Companies such as 3D Metalforge and AdditiveNow—an Australian joint-venture between engineering firm Worley Ltd. and Aurora Labs Ltd.—analyze component inventories to identify parts suitable for printing, developing the designs and processes before helping with testing and certification.</p><p>\"The increased flexibility and confidence on lead times may help drive efficiencies across warehousing, logistics and operations maintenance,\" Brett Woods, who has since become Santos Ltd.'s chief operating officer, said ahead of the Australian energy company's successful stainless-steel printing trial in 2020.</p><p>Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd. has printed parts including a replacement stainless-steel impeller for a floating production storage and offloading facility. For others, the applications can go beyond parts. Japanese engineering group JGC, whose clients include Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, plans to use its concrete construction 3-D printer to build structures around a biomass power plant in the northern city of Ishinomaki.</p><p>The Santos-backed tech, developed by Melbourne-based Spee3D and supported by an Australian government-linked development fund, is being studied by Australia's military for in-field use.</p><p>\"It will never replace the need to have a supply chain because it's not a sort of a Henry Ford production line. It prints it quickly, I use it, get it on a vehicle and get that vehicle moving,\" said Lt. Col. Dean Clark, an Australian army logistics manager overseeing the trial. Lt. Col. Clark says he has seen a 20-inch wrench printed in about 10 minutes.</p><p>For now, a lack of regulation remains an obstacle to widespread adoption in the oil-and-gas sector. Companies are required to use certified components and processes to meet industry benchmarks and insurance requirements, so industry executives hope the API's formalization of standards will help 3-D printing grow even as supply chains normalize.</p><p>The API recently published its standard for metallic components made by 3-D printing. The nonmetallic standard, which Roboze is working on alongside ConocoPhillips and BP PLC, will likely be published early in 2022.</p><p>Chevron's Mr. Rettew, who sits on the API's science and technology committee, said his company has completed three more pilot projects since the Australian trial, one of which involved a pump impeller in North America. Chevron is looking at whether 3-D printing could be used to reduce inventories and to create parts that can't be made from traditional methods.</p><p>\"The pandemic has accelerated implementation. We moved from a 'nice to have' to 'a need to have' environment,\" Mr. Rettew said.</p><p>Chieko Tsuneoka in Tokyo contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stuart Condie at stuart.condie@wsj.com</p><p>Energy Companies Turn to 3-D Printing to Bypass Snarled Supply Chains</p>",
