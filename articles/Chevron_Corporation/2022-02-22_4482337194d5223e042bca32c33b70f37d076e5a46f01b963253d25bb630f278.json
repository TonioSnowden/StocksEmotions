  "title": "As Russia moves into Ukraine, here are the oil stocks that might benefit the most",
  "text": "<p>The stage was already set for higher oil prices with accelerating demand. Further supply uncertainty in the face of economic sanctions against Russia and a possible disruption of the flow of natural gas to western European countries from Russia added to it.</p><p>Here's current coverage of events in Ukraine and in world energy markets:</p><p>Russia moves to secure hold on Ukraine's rebel regions; West prepares sanctions</p><p>Here's what you need to know about Ukraine's separatist regions</p><p>Oil rises and natural gas surges 6% as Russia orders troops to Ukraine</p><p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspends German certification of Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia</p><p>Below is a screen of oil companies' stocks, following the same methodology we used on Feb. 15. Much has changed in a week, with a combination of stock-price action and analysts' target changes meaning the analysts see upside of at least 30% for nine heavily favored stocks, when a week earlier that could be said for only five stocks.</p><p>In order to take a broad look at oil stocks, we began with the holdings of these three exchange traded funds:</p><p>The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE holds the 21 stocks in the energy sector of the S&amp;P 500 SPX.&#xa0;The sector has risen 21.8% this year through Feb. 18. All other sectors of the S&amp;P 500 have fallen during 2022 except for the financial sector, which is up slightly. XLE has $35 billion in assets and annual expenses of 0.12% of assets. It is highly concentrated, with shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM&#xa0;and Chevron Corp. CVX making up 43.5% of the portfolio.</p><p>The iShares Global Energy ETF IXC&#xa0;holds 46 stocks, including all the stocks held by XLE. It brings in large non-U.S. companies, such as Shell PLC UK:SHELSHEL,&#xa0;&#xa0;TotalEnergies SE&#xa0;and BP PLC UK:BPBP. &#xa0;(For the three companies just listed, the first ticker is a European listing, the second is the American depositary receipt, or ADR. Many of the locally traded non-U.S. companies listed below also have ADRs.) IXC has $1.9 billion in assets, with an expense ratio of 0.43%. The fund's largest two holdings are Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which together make up 25.3% of the portfolio</p><p>The iShares S&amp;P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF&#xa0;CA:XEG&#xa0;holds 20 stocks of Canadian energy producers. It is also heavily concentrated, with the three largest holdings, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ, Suncor Energy Inc. SU&#xa0;and Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE&#xa0;making up 62% of the portfolio. The ETF has 2 billion Canadian dollars in total assets, with an expense ratio of 0.63%.</p><p>Analysts' favorite oil stocks</p><p>Together the three ETFs hold 64 stocks. Here are the 18 stocks from that group rated “buy” or the equivalent by at least 80% of analysts polled by FactSet, sorted by the 12-month upside potential implied by consensus price targets.

Don't assume dividends are distributed quarterly, as is common for U.S. stocks. Some companies only distribute annually.</p><p>You might be wondering why Exxon Mobil and Chevron didn't make the screened list, above. Only 35% of the analysts polled by FactSet rate Exxon Mobile a “buy,” after the stock's 26% increase this year through Feb. 18 and its 49% increase from a year earlier. Chevron didn't make the list even though it is rated a “buy” by 74% of analysts because the analysts see “only” 8% upside for the stock over the next year. Then again, both of these stocks have attractive dividend yields, as you can see on the next list, and neither was forced to cut its dividend during the pandemic, when so many other companies did so.</p><p>Highest dividend yields — tread carefully</p><p>During a period of rising oil prices, it seems unlikely that investors will see many energy companies cutting dividends, as they did early in the coronavirus pandemic. Then again, a very high dividend yield implies investors expect payouts to be cut.</p><p>For this screen, we let the chips fall where they may, screening the 64 stocks to list the 23 with dividend yields of 4% or more.

Unlike traditional preferred stocks issued in the U.S., this Petrobas preferred issue has no par value. (More information about the Petrobas ADRs is available in&#xa0;this filing&#xa0;from Dec. 21, 2021, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)</p><p>Any stock with a very high dividend yield is inherently dangerous. The high yield means investors believe the payout will be reduced. If investors expected the dividend to be safe, the share price would be higher and the dividend yield lower. So the highest-yielding stocks might best be left to professionals or other sophisticated investors.</p><p>During a time of special uncertainty for equity markets and the energy market, it remains important for you to do your own research and form your own opinions about which investments, whether through ETFs or other funds or a combination of those and/or individual stocks, match your investment objectives.</p><p>Don't miss:10 tech value stocks that at least 75% of analysts rate as a ‘buy' right now</p>",
