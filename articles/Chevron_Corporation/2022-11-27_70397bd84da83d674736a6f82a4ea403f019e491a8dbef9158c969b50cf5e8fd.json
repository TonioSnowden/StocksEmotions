  "text": "<p>Residents, particularly the richer ones, make a sardonic observation: “Venezuela se arregló!” (or, the country “is fixed”, as someone may be with plastic surgery). But despite the veneer of better times, which followed the government's decision in 2019 to relax price controls and allow trading in the American dollar, the country's underlying troubles are far from solved. Over the past decade its GDP has shrunk by 70%, and around 7m people, or a quarter of the population, have left the country.</p><p>Still, at the end of 2022, Venezuela is very different from how it was in 2019. Back then Juan Guaidó, a little-known opposition leader, was supported by Donald Trump's American administration and much of the Western world. He looked, for a moment, as if he might be able to oust from power the deeply unpopular left-wing dictator Nicolás Maduro, who had rigged an election the previous year. But Mr Guaidó and his backers misjudged the loyalty Mr Maduro and Hugo Chávez, his predecessor from 1999 to 2013, had bought from the military top brass. They underestimated the regime's ruthlessness. And they have been wrongfooted by the war in Ukraine, which has created an environment in which the United States is rethinking its relationship with oil producers.</p><p>Today Mr Guaidó, although still referred to as “president” by the United States and Britain, is nothing of the sort. Better described as one of several opposition leaders, he spends most of his days fielding Zoom calls from a spartan office above a shopping centre. The constitutional basis for his claim to power, that he leads the country's elected National Assembly, is becoming weaker. That assembly was replaced by one controlled by Mr Maduro's regime after a dodgy vote in 2020. And his leadership term expires on January 5th 2023. It looks unlikely that his opposition colleagues will elect him again.</p><p>By contrast, Mr Maduro is still very much in power after nine years. And in the past six months the pendulum of geopolitics has swung in his favour. Venezuela sits on 20% of the world's proven oil reserves, more than any other country. The war in Ukraine has made everyone more nervous about oil supplies, and therefore made the cost of isolating Venezuela seem higher. After decades of mismanagement Venezuela's oil industry is too run-down to make much difference to global oil markets in the short term, but America and others are thinking about the long term.</p><p>Under Mr Trump, America imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil, banking and mining industries as well as more than 140 regime insiders. President Joe Biden, by contrast, is cautiously re-engaging with Venezuela. Mr Biden's envoys have met members of Mr Maduro's regime twice in Caracas. In October, seven American citizens imprisoned in Venezuela were exchanged for two nephews of Mr Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores.</p><p>And on November 26th the Biden administration made a notable shift. It gave Chevron, an American oil company which currently has four dormant joint ventures with PDVSA, Venezuela's state-owned oil giant, a limited licence to begin pumping and exporting oil to the United States again. There are several strings attached. The proceeds are meant to pay down the billions of dollars of accumulated debt Venezuela owes Chevron. Payments of royalties or taxes to the regime, or any dividends to PDVSA, are prohibited.</p><p>The quid pro quo is that the regime agreed to resume negotiations with the opposition, which it had suspended in October 2021. These restarted in Mexico City on the same day as the American announcement. Mr Maduro is not attending the talks himself (his son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, is going). But they are another step towards easing Mr Maduro's pariah status.</p><p>A display of that came in November, when Mr Maduro made a rare overseas visit to the COP27 summit in Egypt. Emmanuel Macron, France's president, greeted him on the sidelines. The two men spoke for less than two minutes, but broke down years of barriers. Mr Macron addressed Mr Maduro as “president,” even though France does not officially recognise him as a legitimate leader. (Things “keep getting better”, beamed the Venezuelan.)</p><p>Mr Maduro also managed to secure a brief conversation with John Kerry, President Biden's chief climate envoy. This was a small victory for the Venezuelan despot, given that the United States has indicted him on charges of “narcoterrorism” and is offering a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest. The state department later said Mr Maduro had caught Mr Kerry by surprise.</p><p>Events closer to home are also helping the tyrant come out of the cold. The victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil's presidential elections means all the region's main economies will soon be led by left-wing governments, which are generally less hostile to Mr Maduro than previous right-wing ones were. When Lula, as he is known, takes office in January, he is expected swiftly to resume diplomatic relations with Venezuela's regime. Already Colombia's government, under Gustavo Petro, the new left-wing president, has started repairing relations. On November 1st Mr Petro became the first Colombian leader in a decade to be received at the presidential palace in Caracas. “Colombia and Venezuela have a common destiny,” Mr Maduro said. (He meant it as a compliment.)</p><p>But foreign governments are taking a gamble by cosying up to Mr Maduro. For a start, Venezuela's oil may be plentiful, but it is also problematic. It is heavy, laborious to refine, and after years of underinvestment and corruption much of the existing infrastructure of PDVSA is in ruins. Production this year is expected to average 650,000 barrels a day (b/d), a fraction of the government's own target of 2m b/d and less than a fifth of its 1998 pre-Chávez peak of 3.4m b/d (see chart).</p><p>It will take until 2024 for a significant amount of oil to reach markets, says Ángel Alvarado, an opposition congressman who is now at the University of Pennsylvania. Even if Venezuela produced 1m b/d by 2025, it would account for about 1% of current global production. In order to get there other foreign firms such as Spain's Repsol or Italy's Eni would need to be able to operate without restrictions. It would also require a huge increase in the amount of foreign investment, which seems unlikely. José Toro Hardy, a former director of PDVSA, estimates that an annual investment of $25bn would be needed over eight years for the company to produce the amount of oil it did two decades ago. Given the regime's record of stiffing creditors and mistreating investors, that is for now an implausibly large sum.</p><p>Second, Mr Maduro's record also suggests that at the negotiating table he will not play fair. The deal being sought is, broadly, that the regime agrees to hold presidential elections with enough safeguards that they could be deemed free, and the opposition agrees to participate. The Biden administration could offer more of what it describes as “sanctions relief” if steps are made towards returning Venezuela to democracy. But Mr Maduro is unlikely to agree to an election clean enough that he might actually lose.</p><p>Perhaps, though, he believes he could win a legitimate vote? Mr Maduro's approval rating is 26%, according to Datanalisis, a pollster. That is low, but only slightly worse than the most popular opposition leader, Manuel Rosales, the governor of Zulia state, who is at 30%. And he is well above Mr Guaidó, who polls at 16%. The pro-regime governor of Carabobo state, Rafael Lacava, has a 40% approval rating, but has never indicated he will stand against Mr Maduro and could become an asset to the president's re-election campaign.</p><p>Another possibility is that Mr Maduro is play-acting: his regime plans to go through the motions of being prepared to take part in a real election, picking up some sanctions relief and legitimacy on the way, but ultimately will never submit itself to voters' wishes.</p><p>Those who say that talks are always better than no talks point to some non-electoral issues where the two sides might agree for the benefit of ordinary Venezuelans. One is access to around $3bn of Venezuelan government assets, currently frozen in American and European banks. As the talks began in Mexico the two sides agreed to establish a United Nations-managed fund to finance health, food and education programmes for the poor, though details of how this will operate still need to be finalised.</p><p>An agreement on the format for elections is not expected to be settled in the first round of talks. But once an election is agreed upon, there remains the question of who will be the candidates. On the government side, Mr Maduro is expected to stand uncontested from within the ruling PSUV party. On the opposition side, there are currently at least 20 candidates, including Mr Guaidó, on the shortlist. Originally there were more than 80. “That's the trouble with the Venezuelan opposition: they all want to be president,” rues a diplomat in Caracas.</p><p>The precise timing of the election is also a matter for debate. While the constitution stipulates it should be held six years after the previous one—so, in 2024—some in the government, including Diosdado Cabello, the powerful former national assembly chief, have hinted recently at the possibility it might be held within months. Such a decision would be made by the electoral council, which the regime still controls.</p><p>This could be part of a tactic to flummox an opposition which has yet to organise itself. But it would also help Mr Maduro and his cronies. Despite the Biden administration's less hostile stance, the myth that “Venezuela is fixed” may be about to unravel. Inflation, which reached 2,700,000% in January 2019, but was then tamed by the use of the dollar, is rising again, with the annual rate at 155%, the highest in Latin America. The value of the bolívar against the dollar also fell 17% in the first three weeks of November, with evidence that the central bank is running short of funds to prop it up.</p><p>For years the opposition, backed by the United States, has been calling for early presidential elections. Mr Maduro might be tempted to call its bluff, and go to the polls before the bubble bursts.</p><p>■</p>",
