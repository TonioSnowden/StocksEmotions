  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON—Top executives from four of the largest Western oil companies—Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC—faced lawmakers Thursday for questioning on the sincerity of their pledges to cut emissions and support other measures to address climate change.</p><p>Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee opened the hearing by accusing the oil industry of waging a yearslong campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming.</p><p>\"After four decades of deception and delay, it is time for the fossil fuel industry to finally change its ways,\" said Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D, N.Y.), the chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p><p>All four companies said in prepared testimony that they have long-acknowledged the threat of climate change and are cutting their carbon emissions to minimize their contributions to it. Many Democrats contend the companies publicly support climate-friendly policies and investments but privately work to derail regulations that would cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>They also say companies have misrepresented the size of their low-carbon investments, which represent less than 5% of their annual capital spending.</p><p>Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods denied that the company had spread disinformation about climate change and said Exxon has responded to the issue as the scientific community's understanding of it has developed.</p><p>\"The fact that ExxonMobil has supported certain climate policies, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax and adherence to the Paris Agreement, while opposing others, is not tantamount to promoting climate disinformation,\" Mr. Woods said in prepared remarks.</p><p>Mr. Woods and the other oil company executives are testifying via remote video links. Others top executives speaking are Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, Shell U.S. President Gretchen Watkins and BP America Inc. Chairman David Lawler.</p><p>on the committee have dismissed the hearing as political theater.</p><p>\"The oil companies have made a significant investment in trying to reduce carbon emissions, and it's my understanding that they are planning on making significant investments in the future, so it looks to me like a lot of energy companies are going in the right direction from a climate standpoint,\" said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the ranking Republican member of the oversight committee.</p><p>States and cities, including New York City, have sued oil and gas producers in more than two dozen lawsuits over alleged misstatements about fossil fuels' contribution to climate change without success so far.</p><p>Democrats on the committee have asked the companies to turn over talking points and other internal documents on climate science and clean energy that executives, lobbyists and public relations staff provided to lawmakers and executive branch officials since late 2015.</p><p>The lawmakers say that the companies have so far failed to adequately comply with their request.</p><p>The companies have said they are complying. A Shell representative said it has delivered thousands of pages detailing the company's position on climate change, its support for global pacts and its own plans to transition to lower-carbon operations.</p><p>\"Meeting the demand for reliable energy—while simultaneously addressing climate change—is a huge undertaking and one of the defining challenges of our time,\" Ms. Watkins said in remarks prepared for Thursday's hearing.</p><p>Ms. Watkins and the other oil company executives are planning to testify via remote video links. Others top executives scheduled to testify are Exxon CEO Darren Woods, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth and BP America Inc. Chairman David Lawler.</p><p>In September, Democrats on the committee opened an investigation into oil companies' statements in support of addressing climate change after environmental group Greenpeace released footage of a senior Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, saying the oil giant was working to strip out certain provisions aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the infrastructure package proposed by President Biden.</p><p>Mr. Woods apologized for Mr. McCoy's remarks and said they didn't represent the company's views. Mr. McCoy also apologized and said that his statements didn't reflect Exxon's policy positions.</p><p>The inquiry comes as Congress negotiates a spending bill that features significant funding to address climate change and is central to the Biden administration's ambitions.</p><p>Lawmakers on Thursday focused on the oil-and-gas industry's lobbying on the bill. Committee Democrats say the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's top lobbying group, and other fossil fuel lobbyists are fighting climate provisions, including a tax on methane emissions, in a well-funded advertising campaign.</p><p>House Republicans have called Neal Crabtree, a welder who worked on the Keystone pipeline expansion project. In January, Mr. Biden revoked a permit for the project, prompting the developer to abandon it.</p><p>The hearing is taking place days before Mr. Biden and other world leaders begin meeting at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow to discuss how to steer the world's energy industry toward cleaner sources to meet commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com and Christopher M.
