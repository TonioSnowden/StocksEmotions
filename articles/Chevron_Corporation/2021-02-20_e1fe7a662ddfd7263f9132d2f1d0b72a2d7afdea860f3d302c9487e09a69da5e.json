  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is bringing its investing expertise to the masses. The elite Wall Street firm known for catering to wealthy clients is set to unveil Marcus Invest, a low-cost digital platform that allocates and automatically rebalances individuals' wealth across portfolios of stocks and bonds based on the models developed by an investment-strategy committee. The new platform will be tucked into Goldman's existing Marcus consumer-banking app and website, which also offers savings accounts, unsecured personal loans and budgeting software. Goldman Sachs shares gained 1.8% Tuesday.</p><p>MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC.</p><p>MAR +0.7%</p><p>The man who built Marriott into a global colossus died Monday. A Lutheran missionary's son who was born in Japan and grew up in Minnesota, Arne Sorenson was the first person outside the founding family to run Marriott. He continued to serve as CEO after he was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer in May 2019. Marriott prevailed over rival bidders in 2016 with its $13 billion acquisition of Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., creating a giant with 30 brands including Ritz-Carlton and Sheraton. Marriott shares added 0.7% Tuesday.</p><p>WALMART INC.</p><p>WMT -6.5%</p><p>Walmart hopes to put a smiley face on more than 400,000 of its workers. On Thursday, America's largest private employer promised to raise hourly wages to an average above $15 for its U.S. workers in digital and stocking roles. Its minimum starting wage for those workers remains $11 an hour, while rivals Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. pay U.S. workers a starting hourly wage of $15. Walmart shares lost 6.5% Thursday.</p><p>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.</p><p>VZ +5.2%</p><p>Warren Buffett is making a big new bet on the telecommunications industry. The billionaire's conglomerate purchased $8.6 billion in stock in Verizon., the largest U.S. mobile carrier. Berkshire Hathaway also purchased $4.1 billion in the oil company Chevron Corp. The investments show Berkshire's confidence in the long-term value of these traditional U.S. corporations and their respective industries, despite short-term struggles. Verizon's fourth-quarter profit fell after it reported higher costs and added fewer new customers than usual. Verizon shares gained 5.2% Wednesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN +1.2%</p><p>New York state is taking Amazon to court. State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the online retail giant Tuesday, accusing it of not doing enough to protect its New York workers from the coronavirus. Ms. James's suit claims that Amazon failed to comply with state cleaning and disinfection requirements at its facilities. Last week Amazon sued Ms. James in an attempt to stop New York from taking action against the company over its handling of worker safety and the firing of one of its warehouse workers. Amazon.com shares rose 1.2% Wednesday.</p><p>NXP SEMICONDUCTORS NV</p><p>NXPI -2%</p><p>Chip makers are powering down their Texas factories due to a winter storm roiling the South. The state has asked semiconductor companies such as NXP Semiconductors and Samsung Electronics Co. to shut down operations in Austin to help conserve energy. The conditions left millions of Texans without power for days, and the outages prompted local officials to ask companies to minimize demand on the region's power grid. The factory disruptions come at a critical time for the chip industry, which already faces a shortage due to surging pandemic demand. NXP shares fell 2% Thursday.</p><p>GAMESTOP CORP.</p><p>GME -11%</p><p>Lawmakers want answers on what drove the wild rally in GameStop's shares last month. Top executives of Robinhood Markets Inc., Reddit Inc. and others faced questions Thursday from the House Financial Services Committee about their roles in the saga. The short squeeze, during which a group of online traders helped send shares of the videogame retailer surging before the stock crashed, led to questions about the market's integrity and set off federal probes into possible market manipulation. GameStop shares fell 11% Thursday.</p>",
