  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA jumped 670 points, or 2.3%, to 23,396.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 77 points, or 2.1%, to 3,662.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 178 points, or 1.7%, to 10,753.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen for three consecutive quarters, off 24.8% over that time, and it lost 9.3% in September, the biggest monthly fall since March 2020. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on Friday posted their lowest finishes since November 2020, while the Nasdaq saw its lowest close since July 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks were kicking off October and the fourth quarter on a positive note, though worries lingered that the higher borrowing costs needed to crush multidecade high inflation will damage the economy and hit corporate profits. Higher Treasury yields also make riskier assets, like equities, less attractive to investors.</p><p>Early gains were extended after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index fell to a 28-month low of 50.9% in September as high inflation and rapidly rising U.S. interest rates began to rattle the economy. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to drop to 52% from 52.8% in August.</p><p>Improving supply-chain measures in the report were a \"silver lining,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note.</p><p>\"Both the supplier delivery and order backlog indexes fell again, and they point very clearly to a steep drop in margin inflation, reversing the spike over the past 18 months. This is turn will feed directly into much lower core PPI and PCE inflation,\" he wrote.</p><p>Traders and analysts said stocks were technically overdue for a short-term bounce after a brutal selloff, but also expressed caution.</p><p>Market internals are \"shot to pieces,\" with 1.7% of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 20-day moving average, 32% of companies sporting a relative strength index below 30 — signaling oversold conditions — and 35% of companies at new 4-week lows, said Chris Weston, director of research at Sydney-based Pepperstone, in a note.</p><p>\"This ultra-bearish sentiment plays into the risk vs. reward trade-off, and it suggests if we hear something remotely positive, and we see better flow, the result will be a pronounced equity counter-rally, which may motivate funds to reduce U.S. dollar long positions as the default equity hedge,\" he wrote.</p><p>But investors could also be in for another brutal week, Weston said, noting that \"liquidity remains a core consideration that exacerbates moves as funds try and get out of positions.\"</p><p>\"In this backdrop it pays to take the time frame down, understand that markets can turn on a dime and on little news and quite often these moves make little sense —nail your position size, have an open mind, and react with intent — this will serve you well and keep you in the game,\" he said.</p><p>Investors were weighing problems for Credit Suisse, a European banking giant, as they remained on the lookout for signs aggressive tightening by global central banks was beginning to cause collateral damage in financial markets.</p><p>See: Credit Suisse: What's going on, and why its stock is falling</p><p>There was some calming news from the U.K., however, where a government U-turn on tax policy that had so roiled equity and fixed-income markets last week helped push sovereign bond yields lower.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y declined nearly 10 basis points to 3.70% as the equivalent duration U.K. bond BX:TMBMKGB-10Y eased 23 basis points to 3.917%.</p><p>In other economic data, S&amp;P said its U.S. final manufacturing index came in at 51.5 in September versus a preliminary reading of 51.8.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA fell 7.7% after the electric-vehicle maker reported record quarterly deliveries on Sunday. The number still disappointed analysts.</p><p>* Oil-and-gas companies like Chevron Corp. CVX, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Marathon Energy Corp. MPC and Devon Energy Corp. DVN surged on the back of higher oil prices following reports the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, or OPEC+, would consider a large production cut at a meeting this week. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for November CLX22 delivery rose $3.20, or 4%, to $82.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>Read: OPEC+ could cut oil production because it's trying to halt a sharp crude selloff</p><p>Dow surges over 600 points as stocks attempt bounce after brutal September</p>",
