  "title": "Energy Secretary Urges Oil Companies to Address High Gas Prices; Biden administration is asking Exxon, Shell and others to shore up supplies as gasoline hovers near $5 a gallon",
  "text": "<p>The group discussed ideas such as waiving Jones Act limitations on domestic shipping, accelerating permits for offshore energy production and suspending the production of more expensive premium fuels. But industry officials expect little to come from what amounted to a brainstorming session, with little consensus between the companies and the White House on how to respond.</p><p>Ms. Granholm acknowledged that refineries are currently running so hard they have little ability to increase production, and told executives the administration didn't want any of them to slow down a transition to biofuels that has further limited capacity in recent months.</p><p>\"The secretary set a collaborative tone early on by acknowledging the global nature of oil markets and prices, and that some companies, including Shell, have diminished refining capacity because we're busy converting century-old assets to produce biofuels,\" Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell USA Inc., said through a spokesman.</p><p>Ms. Granholm had also sought a promise that oil companies would pass along any benefits directly to consumers, if the administration can persuade Congress to adopt its newest proposal to suspend the federal gasoline tax, officials had said before the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon, a driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on U.S. consumers ahead of midterm elections this year. A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy, frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings.</p><p>The average national gasoline price slipped Thursday to $4.94 a gallon after sharp drops in oil prices and gasoline futures. The declines were driven by investor concerns that high fuel prices will crimp demand and that rising inflation overall is threatening economic growth.</p><p>For months the Biden administration has called on the oil industry to do more to help, spurring frequent pushback and criticism from industry in return. Mr. Biden spent his early days in office moving to fulfill environmental promises to shift the country away from oil, and industry executives say he is now trying to blame them for his political problems, according to lobbyists.</p><p>In televised remarks and in a letter to fuel makers, Mr. Biden has recently urged oil companies to expand refining capacity. In the letter Mr. Biden also accused them of profiteering, writing that \"at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto Americans are unacceptable.\"</p><p>That prompted a pointed response from Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth, who said Mr. Biden's rhetoric wasn't helping to solve the problem.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How fair is it for the Biden administration to blame the oil industry—including refining companies—for high gasoline prices? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Chevron and its 37,000 employees work every day to help provide the world with the energy it demands and to lift up the lives of billions of people who rely on these supplies,\" Mr. Wirth wrote. \"Notwithstanding these efforts, your Administration has largely sought to criticize, and at times vilify, our industry.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden's options to ease prices in the coming months are limited, according to analysts and economists. U.S. refining capacity has declined to about 17.9 million barrels a day as of the beginning of 2022, down about 5.4% from the start of 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>In that time, the number of U.S. operating refineries has fallen from 135 to 130, as companies including Phillips 66 and Shell shut down facilities. Some plan to convert traditional oil refineries to make biofuels, such as Marathon's Martinez, Calif., refinery, Phillips 66's refinery in Rodeo, Calif. LyondellBasell has said it plans to close a Houston refinery in 2023.</p><p>John Auers, executive vice president at energy consulting firm Turner, Mason &amp; Co., said oil refineries are unlike other kinds of manufacturers that can quickly restart assembly lines of products when demand returns. The decisions fuel makers have made to shut or convert facilities to make renewable diesel, for example, are irreversible, and it appears unlikely refiners will regain confidence in long-term profit margins to invest in substantial expansions, he said.</p><p>\"There's really not a lot of solutions and levers or buttons that can be turned or pushed by the refiners,\" Mr. Auers said. \"They are running full out and if they run any harder, they risk making the situation worse by having unplanned outages.\"</p><p>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Energy Secretary Urges Oil Companies to Address High Gas Prices</p>",
