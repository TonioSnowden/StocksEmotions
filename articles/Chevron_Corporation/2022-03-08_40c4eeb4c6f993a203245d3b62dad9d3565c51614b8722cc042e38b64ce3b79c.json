  "title": "Western Oil Giants'  Russia Bets Crumble  ---- -2-",
  "text": "<p>   Shutting down Sakhalin will be technically difficult. The operations sit in waters that can freeze in 6 feet of ice, and temperatures can fall below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Finding someone to buy the asset could prove challenging, as the market for Russian investments has evaporated. Exxon has estimated its value at about $4 billion. Production from Sakhalin has declined as the project has aged and currently represents about 3% of Exxon's overall oil production. </p><p>   France's TotalEnergies SE is the only major Western oil company that has retained a significant presence in Russia, saying on March 1 it would no longer provide capital for new projects there but stopping short of ending existing ones. France's finance minister discussed the matter with the company's CEO several times last week, but didn't pressure TotalEnergies to divest its assets in Russia, which isn't required by the current round of sanctions, said people familiar with the discussions. </p><p>   TotalEnergies referred to its statement last week that it wouldn't fund new Russian projects. A person close to the company said it had no plans to sell off its assets in the country unless forced to do so by additional sanctions. </p><p>    Chevron Corp. has no operations in Russia but owns a 15% stake in a pipeline carrying oil from a Chevron project in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities on Russia's Black Sea coast. The U.S. company isn't currently planning to exit that investment, according to a person close to the company. Chevron in a written statement said the pipeline is a key export route for oil used by consumers around the world. </p><p>   Lawyers, accountants and outside advisers are working to determine how the oil companies can restructure their Russian holdings. They are exploring complex options for ring fencing them from ongoing operations -- transferring the assets to separate corporate entities -- while winding them down and trying to preserve as much value as possible, some of the people close to the companies said. Options include escrow accounts with shareholders named as beneficiaries and special-purpose entities walled off from continuing businesses. </p><p>   Asset sales would be challenging, some of the people close to the companies said. One primary goal is to avoid ceding direct control to a Russian counterpart or otherwise inadvertently benefiting Russia, they said. </p><p>   Threats from Russian officials that they will constrain foreign investors from selling Russian assets could give the Western companies legal remedies in international courts, lawyers said. Companies may have grounds to argue indirect expropriation, said Lucia Raimanova, a partner with Allen &amp; Overy LLP who handles international commercial disputes. But even that avenue to recoup losses looks tough, she said. \"You are looking at a multiyear battle.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Timothy Puko and Nick Kostov contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
