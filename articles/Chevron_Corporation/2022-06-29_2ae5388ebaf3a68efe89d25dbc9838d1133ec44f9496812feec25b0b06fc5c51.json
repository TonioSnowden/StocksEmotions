  "title": "Exxon Mobil to Sell Canadian Shale Gas Assets for About $1.5 Billion; Exxon and subsidiary Imperial Oil are selling XTO Energy Canada to Whitecap Resources",
  "text": "<p>While several large western oil companies have exited Canada's oil sands due to economic and environmental challenges, Canada's shale formations have attracted some big spenders in recent years, including ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp., that have sought to apply U.S.-style fracking there. Still, regulatory challenges to expanding pipeline capacity have weighed on drilling activity in the region.</p><p>Exxon had originally acquired the assets in 2013 when it bought independent Canadian oil producer Celtic Exploration Ltd. for about $2.64 billion. In late 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic that crimped energy demand, Exxon included the Canadian shale assets in a $20 billion write-down, removing them from the company's long-term development plans.</p><p>This year, Exxon has also agreed to sell gas assets in the Barnett shale of North Texas for $750 million and is looking to sell similar assets in the Fayetteville shale of Arkansas. The company has said it is focused on investing in lower-cost projects such as those it has in Guyana, Brazil and the Permian Basin in the U.S.</p><p>\"We are continuing to high-grade our portfolio,\" said Meghan Macdonald, an Exxon spokeswoman. \"Our priorities for capital remain the same: investing in advantaged assets, strengthening the balance sheet and providing returns to our shareholders.\"</p><p>Calgary-based Imperial, which is majority-owned by Exxon, said the deal would allow it to concentrate on Canada's oil sands. While many major U.S. and European oil companies have backed out of Canadian oil sands following pressure from investors and environmentalists, production is expected to grow for years from the world's fourth-largest oil reserve.</p><p>In addition to the oil sands' high costs, extracting and refining the region's heavy oil or bitumen is on average a more carbon-intensive process than almost any other type of extraction.</p><p>Exxon and its affiliates produced about 140 million cubic feet per day of gas and 9,000 barrels per day of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids in the Western Canada shale assets, relatively small amounts for the oil giant.</p><p>Neal Dingmann, an analyst at Truist Bank, said originally the asset sale was expected to bring in about $1 billion, but natural-gas prices are up 84% from the end of last year, and consequently Exxon is getting a higher price per each unit of gas production than other U.S. gas companies did in deals late last year.</p><p>\"It shows that everyone realizes we're in a robust macro environment not only for oil but also for gas,\" Mr. Dingmann said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What does Exxon's exit from Canadian shale signify?
