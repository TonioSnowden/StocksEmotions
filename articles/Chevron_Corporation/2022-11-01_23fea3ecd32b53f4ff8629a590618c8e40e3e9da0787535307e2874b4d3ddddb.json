  "title": "BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares; Oil major beats expectations in banner year for the world's biggest energy companies",
  "text": "<p>A big clue behind BP's trading gains came from the underlying profit in its gas and low-carbon segment, which totaled $6.2 billion in the third quarter before interest and taxes. That was more than BP's profit from the same segment in the first nine months of 2021.</p><p>High natural-gas prices have been core to Europe's energy woes, but are also producing record profits for the world's largest energy companies. As Russia's war against Ukraine rages on, an energy crisis threatens to throw the bloc into recession.</p><p>The profits are drawing political scrutiny from both sides of the Atlantic, with politicians in the U.S. now calling for a windfall-profits levy on the industry similar to the one implemented in the U.K. earlier this year.</p><p>On a conference call Tuesday morning, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss resisted calls from multiple analysts to be more specific about the gas-trading profit. \"Who do you fear? Why not make that more transparent? Is it the political environment?\" Bank of America Corp. analyst Christopher Kuplent asked.</p><p>Mr. Auchincloss declined to confirm Mr. Kuplent's estimate of $3 billion from gas trading, saying, \"I think transparency on trading is a tricky thing.\" He suggested that one business's results don't fairly encompass BP's fuller operations and investments.</p><p>The back-and-forth reflects widespread efforts by investors, politicians and climate groups to nail down how much major oil companies are profiting from oil and gas. Mr. Kuplent declined to comment Tuesday, citing rules about divulging any analysis ahead of publishing research.</p><p>BP's overall third-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. Flush with cash, BP said it plans to boost its oil-and-gas production both on- and offshore in the U.S. and the North Sea, with as many as seven new drilling rigs planned across those regions.</p><p>\"The case for a bigger, bolder windfall tax is now overwhelming,\" environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, a frequent critic of oil-company profits and expanded fossil-fuel production, said Tuesday in response to BP's earnings.</p><p>BP expects overall full-year production to be \"slightly higher\" in 2022, despite the loss of output from Russia after its decision to exit from the country. BP said it expects high oil-and-gas prices to continue, fueled in part by prolonged energy shortages in Europe.</p><p>BP's earnings come after Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, last week reported around $40 billion in collective profits in the third quarter. Meanwhile Russia's war against Ukraine is exacerbating high energy costs for consumers and businesses.</p><p>BP said it expects to pay around $800 million as a result of a new U.K. windfall-profits levy this year. That will be part of a projected $2.5 billion in overall 2022 taxes linked to its U.K. North Sea business, the company said.</p><p>On Monday, President Biden called on Congress to penalize oil-and-gas companies if they don't use their profits to help lower energy costs for consumers. But the proposal, which comes before next week's U.S. midterm elections, faces hurdles from lawmakers.</p><p>Mr. Auchincloss said Tuesday that there isn't enough detail behind a potential additional U.S. levy to say how it might affect BP. \"We're really trying to help the U.S. with energy security today and with the transition,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>BP's ramped-up 2023 oil-and-gas production plans include two new Gulf of Mexico production facilities, one a drilling rig and the other a so-called workover rig, Mr. Auchincloss said. The latter is typically smaller than a drilling rig and used to increase productivity from existing wells.</p><p>The company previously said it is increasing spending on U.S. onshore oil and gas drilling, too. Mr. Auchincloss said Tuesday that this is expected to result in two to three new rigs next year across BP's three primary U.S. basins, which include the sprawling Texas-New Mexico Permian Basin and Haynesville Shale, a giant natural-gas field in Louisiana.</p><p>BP will debate details on U.S. shale expansion during its December budgeting process, Mr. Auchincloss said.</p><p>For the third quarter, BP said its underlying replacement-cost profit, a metric similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report, came in at $8.2 billion. That beat the $6.1 billion average projection of 29 analysts compiled by BP and the $3.3 billion it reported a year earlier. BP's underlying third-quarter profit fell just shy of last quarter's figure, its strongest in more than a decade, boosted by high refining margins and higher oil-and-gas trading results.</p><p>The additional share buyback brings BP's announced stock purchases so far this year to $8.5 billion.</p><p>Shares in BP were up 1.4% in afternoon in London.</p><p>BP's reported net result for the third quarter, which takes into account certain accounting effects related to inventory valuations amid price volatility, as well as legal costs from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and other adjustments, was a $2.2 billion loss. However, that reported result mostly reflected the accounting treatment of whipsawing natural-gas prices, and was overshadowed by the more telling $8.2 billion replacement-cost profit.</p><p>BP said it expects total capital expenditure in 2022 to be about $15.5 billion. That figure assumes the completion by year-end of its purchase of U.S. biogas producer Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion including debt, which was announced in October. BP previously forecast capital spending this year at $14 billion to $15 billion.</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares</p>",
