  "text": "<p>The defendants fighting such claims include BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC.</p><p>They sought to move Baltimore's case to federal court, which they argued is a more appropriate venue with fairer procedural protections. The companies said the case belonged in the federal system because some of their oil-and-gas exploration efforts have come at the behest of the federal government.</p><p>A federal trial judge denied the request in 2019 and last year a federal appeals court said it was largely powerless to consider moving the case out of the state system.</p><p>The high court, in a 7-1 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, on Monday said that decision was incorrect.</p><p>In a highly technical ruling, the Supreme Court sent the case back to a federal appeals court for further proceedings. The justices said nothing about the substance of the case.</p><p>Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Justice Samuel Alito didn't participate in the case.</p>",
