  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  High oil prices are profitable for Saudi Aramco -- and even more so for the Saudi government. </p><p>\n  The conflicting incentives that kept most international shareholders away from the 2019 initial public offering of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. were on full display in Sunday's strong financial results. Minority shareholders are right to worry that their interests come second to those of the majority-holding state. </p><p>\n  Global oil prices at around $100 a barrel helped Aramco generate $39.5 billion profit and a 27.2% return on average capital employed in the first quarter. Like its international rivals, it paid dividends, chipped away at debt and offered shareholders a little bonus. Unlike peers, it will significantly increase capital spending -- to between $40 billion and $50 billion this year from $31.9 billion last year. </p><p>\n  For Aramco's minority shareholders, a Brent price just under $100 a barrel represents a sweet spot. The royalty Aramco pays the state on the value of its oil production increases as Brent rises: 15% when oil is under $70 a barrel, 45% on the marginal value above $70 and below $100, and 80% on anything over $100. So most of the value over $100 a barrel goes to the Saudi government. Expensive crude increases the risk that users cut back or switch to substitutes, permanently reducing long-term demand. </p><p>\n  The financial interest of Saudi's controlling shareholder in keeping prices high may help explain the company's behavior during the energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices have risen and remain twitchy amid fears that the world could lose Russia's substantial exports. As the global swing producer, Aramco can bring benchmarks down, but hasn't. It has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million barrels a day but produced 10.3 million barrels a day in March, according to Joint Organizations Data Initiative. </p><p>\n  Aramco might need time to open the taps, but its 2.7% increase in oil production during the first quarter seems meager. The company increased production to 12 million barrels a day in April 2020 from 9.7 million barrels a day in March 2020 during a standoff with Russia that sent crude prices briefly below zero. Western officials have been lobbying Riyadh to produce more, but Saudi stuck to existing OPEC plans to increase production only slowly. There is a valid risk that Chinese Covid-19 lockdowns reduce global oil demand. However, Aramco's decision keeps prices high, filling the state coffers and avoiding upsetting Moscow, a key partner in maintaining cooperation and discipline within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. </p><p>\n  Aramco shares are up nearly one-third this year, restoring the Saudi company's position as the world's largest public company by market value but trailing the performance of Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The stock is still relatively expensive, trading at an enterprise value of around eight times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. U.S. rivals change hands for around five times and Europeans for around three times. </p><p>\n  Operationally Aramco may be a well-oiled machine, but for any investor other than the Saudi state it remains a slippery prospect. </p><p></p>",
