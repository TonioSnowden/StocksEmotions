  "title": "Oil and Gas Profits Are an Easy Political Target; BP is the latest supermajor to report strong third-quarter earnings that are likely to fuel further calls for higher taxes as well as bumper shareholder returns",
  "text": "<p>Business for European supermajors BP and Shell might be too good for political comfort.</p><p>On Tuesday, BP said it recorded $8.2 billion in underlying earnings in the third quarter—slightly behind the previous quarter's bonanza but far ahead of the equivalent period last year. Commodity prices have moderated since the summer, but volatile natural-gas markets helped BP's traders rake in exceptional profits. Shell's gas trading had a disappointing quarter but the company still reported strong results last Thursday, with $9.5 billion in adjusted earnings.</p><p>These are conspicuously ripe pickings for politicians under pressure to do something to temper the energy-led inflation pinching households and industrial users. President Biden threatened additional levies on producers' profits Monday after bumper third-quarter earnings at Exxon and Chevron. U.S. political realities will likely make it difficult for him to follow through, but additional taxes in Europe seem a near certainty.</p><p>The region's energy crunch has caused dramatic inflation in fuel and power bills. Politicians remain under considerable pressure to ease the burden but most are limited by tight government finances. Big headline earnings at energy producers prompt calls to capture part of their \"windfall profits.\" Some countries have already applied levies and many are considering more.</p><p>Britain, where both BP and Shell are based, is a case in point. Six months ago, then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a 25% \"Energy Profits Levy\" on U.K. oil-and-gas profits. Set to last until 2025, it was forecast to raise £5 billion, equivalent to about $5.8 billion, in the following 12 months and included a super-deduction for up to 91% tax relief on local investment.</p><p>The new tax revenues seem likely to disappoint, despite the bumper profits reported by big producers. BP said Tuesday that the British levy would cost it $800 million this year as part of its total $2.5 billion U.K. tax bill. Last week, Shell said it likely wouldn't pay any U.K. windfall tax this year at all, partly because of deductions for its additional North Sea investments. The companies played by the new rules, but that didn't stop a public backlash and calls to take a bigger slice of their earnings.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the companies have delivered in spades for investors. Combined, they booked $9 billion in dividends and bought back $21 billion worth of shares in the first three quarters of 2022. Both promise more to come. But that very largess makes them easy targets. Mr. Sunak is eager to make his mark as Britain's latest prime minister and is scrambling to fill a gaping budget hole.</p><p>New levies across Europe seem almost inevitable in the current climate, but the fine print will be crucial for investors. If the taxes include generous investment deductions, companies will have the opportunity to minimize their bills. If politicians opt for something more novel, say a tax on buybacks akin to Mr. Biden's levy, the impact could be much more significant.</p><p>Write to Rochelle Toplensky at rochelle.toplensky@wsj.com</p><p>Oil and Gas Profits Are an Easy Political Target</p>",
