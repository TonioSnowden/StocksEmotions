  "text": "<p>It's been a strong week for clean energy companies in global financial markets as four firms raise millions in funding from the United States, Hong Kong, Spain and France. In fact, China's Tianqi Lithium, one of the world's top producers of lithium chemicals for electric vehicle batteries, plans to sell about 164.12 million shares in its Hong Kong listing, in the city's largest share sale so far this year, according to sources.</p><p>The news comes as the White House and EU made pledges towards phasing out combustion engine cars and investing more money in electric vehicle (EV) production.</p><p>Tianqi Lithium will sell its shares for between HK$69 and HK$82 ($8.79-$10.45) each for a Hong Kong listing which could raise up to $2 billion, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Tianqi plans to open the books from today to July 6, and debut in Hong Kong on July 13, according to a Reuters source. The sources could not be named as the information was not yet public and Tianqi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Lithium prices have soared in the past year, despite some volatility caused during Shanghai's COVID lockdown, on sustained global demand for electric vehicles. Failure to obtain adequate supplies of lithium, nickel, manganese or cobalt could slow the shift to EVs, make those vehicles more expensive and threaten carmakers' profit margins. Major carmakers have been racing to secure battery cell supplies, but finding enough battery raw materials may be a bigger problem.</p><p>Speaking of demand for electric vehicles, the White House said on Tuesday that companies are planning to invest more than $700 million to boost U.S. manufacturing capacity for EV chargers, whilst EU countries backed a law requiring new cars sold in the EU to emit zero CO2 from 2035. That would make it impossible to sell internal-combustion engine cars. It will require governments and industries to invest heavily in cleaner manufacturing, renewable energy and electric vehicles.</p><p>Elsewhere, a top U.S. solar energy project developer announced a $750 million equity investment from the climate-focused private equity fund TPG Rise Climate. The announcement from TPG is part of the firm's push into climate change and clean energy investing on behalf of clients that include large pension funds and insurance companies seeking to do more for the environment.</p><p>Meanwhile, French renewable energy company NW Groupe raised 300 million euros ($315 million) for its NW Storm arm, as France builds up its renewable power sector to reduce its reliance on Russian energy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Spain, renewable power company Opdenergy announced plans to launch an initial public offering to raise up to 200 million euros ($209.80 million) to finance its business plan up to 2025, in what will be Spain's first flotation this year.</p><p>* Talking Points - Japan's electricity grid creaked on Thursday under the strain of Tokyo's hottest June since records began, with the unexpected shutdown of a power plant raising fears that tens of millions of people could be deprived of power on another scorching day. - Turning building heating down by two degrees and limiting driving speeds could immediately cut energy consumption and avoid a supply crisis if Russia stopped delivering gas and oil, Germany's environment agency said on Thursday. - A federal judge in Washington, D.C. dismissed a lawsuit by eight citizens of Mali who sought to hold Hershey, Nestle, Cargill and others liable for child slavery on Ivory Coast cocoa farms. - Ferrari makes some of the fastest cars on the road, but the luxury Italian automaker is taking the slow lane to an electric future as it tries to overcome the technology's disadvantages against today's powerful fossil fuel engines. - Breakingviews: The European Union's gas headache hasn't gone away. Despite strong progress in hiking liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases, the bloc is some way off its self-imposed year-end target of cutting Russian gas imports by two-thirds.

Ocean Revolution recently won the Company of the Year Award and Sustainability Award at Young Enterprise, a UK education charity's national competition.</p><p>“Climate change is a global issue and one that will severely impact young people's futures if left alone.
