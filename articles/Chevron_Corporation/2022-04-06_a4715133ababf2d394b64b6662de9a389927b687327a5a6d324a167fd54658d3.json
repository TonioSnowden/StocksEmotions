  "title": "Oil Executives Reject Price-Gouging Accusations; Russia's invasion, supply shortfalls and restrictive U.S. policies caused higher gas prices, executives tell House panel",
  "text": "<p>The industry executives, who testified via video links before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight subcommittee, rejected claims by Democrats that they are gouging consumers during a global crisis and said market forces, not U.S. oil producers, dictate consumer prices.</p><p>Chevron leader Michael Wirth and Richard Muncrief, chief executive officer of one of the largest independent U.S. producers, Devon Energy Corp., said their companies are already responding with new investment in boosting output. But Pioneer Natural Resources Co. CEO Scott Sheffield said it could be as much as two years before such investments could lead to enough new supply to materially bring down prices.</p><p>The industry \"is experiencing severe cost inflation, a labor shortage due to three downturns in 12 years, shortages of drilling rigs, frack fleets, frack sand, steel pipe and other equipment and materials, and the need for pipelines and LNG facilities,\" Mr. Sheffield said.</p><p>The hearing is the latest skirmish over who bears responsibility for pump prices that lingered at record highs throughout March. They have fed inflation that surged to 40-year highs, and have become central to a political dispute between Democrats who accuse oil companies for price gouging and Republicans who said restrictive climate policies from President Biden deserve blame.</p><p>Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.), who chairs the oversight panel, demanded executives say what they could do immediately to boost supply and reduce prices.</p><p>\"Now it's time for Congress to alleviate the pain many Americans are feeling at the pump,\" she said.</p><p>Rep. Morgan Griffith (R., Va.), the top Republican on the oversight subcommittee, responded that President Biden bore responsibility for the rising prices by an \"anti-American energy agenda,\" including by canceling the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline extension.</p><p>\"We need to look for ways to increase our domestic production and our export capacity,\" Mr. Griffith said. \"We need energy policy that promotes energy security while also taking advantage of America's abundant energy resources.\"</p><p>Oil-industry leaders have denied that they are profiteering, saying the rising fuel costs stem from shortages driven first by the quick economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and later by Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p><p>Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in remarks prepared for the hearing that the fear of losing Russian supply has fed price increases. He said his company has started to exit from an oil-and-gas project it runs on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine and that the company will make no further investments in Russia.</p><p>Closing that venture would remove nearly 230,000 barrels a day from global oil supplies and about 3% of the company's overall oil production, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.</p><p>\"Russia provides roughly 10% of the oil needed to meet global demand, and about 30% of Europe's natural-gas demand,\" Mr. Woods said. \"Unfortunately there's no quick fix. But in the near term the answer is straightforward: If we want to reduce prices, we need to increase supply.\"</p><p>Oil-industry profits were a major focus of the hearing. Exxon reported $23 billion and Chevron nearly $16 billion in net income for 2021, the most profitable year for both since 2014. They rebounded from multibillion-dollar losses in 2020.</p><p>Both companies attributed their turnarounds to surging demand for oil and gasoline as the economy has recovered from the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether oil companies have illegally pushed prices higher, and he has proposed charging oil companies a fee if they don't pump oil on federal land for which they hold leasing rights to drill.</p><p>The House committee's Democratic staff published a memo Monday questioning why rising gasoline prices at the pump have outpaced the increase of oil prices in commodity markets.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How much do you blame the oil industry for high gasoline prices? What about Washington and independent market forces? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In 2008, when crude prices reached nearly $150 a barrel, average nationwide gasoline prices topped out at roughly $4.15 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This year crude prices haven't surpassed $130 a barrel, but gasoline prices averaged more than $4.30 a gallon for the entire month of March.</p><p>Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell PLC's U.S. arm, said in her prepared remarks that those gasoline prices are set not by the oil companies but by retailers, based on local market conditions including wages.</p><p>\"Because oil is a global commodity, Shell does not set or control the price of crude oil,\" she said. \"Similarly, Shell does not set or control the price that consumers pay.\"</p><p>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com</p><p>Oil Executives Reject Price-Gouging Accusations</p>",
