  "title": "Nuclear Fusion Attracts Startups—and Skeptics; Thanks to technological advances, some private companies predict fusion may be on the grid as early as the 2030s",
  "text": "<p>Now, some private companies are saying that the timeline to make fusion a viable, large-scale energy source is changing and that we could see fusion power on the grid as soon as the 2030s. While many others say that won't be feasible until the second half of the century, optimism about a long shot that could pay off is powering investment around the world.</p><p>Many of the startups promising fusion have appeared in the past few years. According to a reportby the Fusion Industry Association and the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority, at least 35 private fusion companies are operating around the world, 18 of which have received a total of about $1.8 billion in private funding. Of the 23 companies the report surveyed, about half were founded in the past five years.</p><p>Nuclear fusion—the lesser known and opposite reaction to nuclear fission—occurs when two light atomic nuclei merge to form a single heavier one. That process releases huge amounts of energy, no carbon emissions and very limited radioactivity. Fusion reactions take place in a state of matter called plasma—a hot charged gas made of ions and free-moving electrons—and require temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius to enable the nuclei to overcome their mutual electric repulsion and collide. The main fuels used in nuclear fusion are deuterium and tritium, two isotopes of hydrogen—one is a key element of water, the other can be produced during the reaction through lithium.</p><p>\"The thing with fusion is, it's impossible to have an accident; there's no long-term waste and you can't weaponize it,\" says Christopher Mowry, the chief executive officer of General Fusion, a Canadian startup backed by billionaire Jeff Bezos. \"It removes the issue of energy security, which has troubled the world for more than a century.\"</p><p>Big challenges</p><p>Still, no company or research project has been able to create fusion systems that can generate more energy than they consume in a self-sustaining reaction, mainly due to challenges associated with the high temperatures, density and pressure required to trigger the fusion process. Only after that process is mastered can scientists move to the task of building a power-generating reactor.</p><p>Today, the largest fusion program under development is ITER, a $22 billion multinational government-funded project in southern France designed not to produce electricity, but to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion by producing a net energy gain and maintaining the reaction for longer periods. At the heart of the experiment is a massive, doughnut-shaped machine called a tokamak, where the fusion reaction is set to take place. The device is one of the most commonly used for a fusion approach known as magnetic confinement, which uses magnetic fields to squeeze the plasma.</p><p>Scientists say the project, which has experienced delays, is now on track to create superheated plasma by the end of 2025 and achieve full fusion a decade later. The next step will be a demonstration power plant meant to supply fusion electricity to the grid for the first time.</p><p>Tim Luce, head of science and operation at ITER, doesn't expect fusion power to contribute to the energy mix until around 2070. For every energy source developed in the 20th century, it takes about 30 years from the time it is first produced at industrial scale to the time it makes up at least 1% of the energy market share world-wide, he says.</p><p>Private companies, though, are more optimistic.</p><p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an MIT spinoff, are building a smaller tokamak device that they say is set to demonstrate net energy from fusion by 2025. They plan to have a fusion power plant that would produce electricity by the early 2030s.</p><p>In September, the company announced a milestone for magnetic-confinement fusion when it successfully tested a high-temperature superconducting electromagnet that produced a magnetic-field strength of 20 tesla—the most powerful fusion magnet of its kind on Earth—while consuming only about 30 watts of power. A stronger magnetic field improves confinement of the plasma, increasing the rate of fusion energy production.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Canadian startup General Fusion plans to build a demonstration power plant at the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority's site in Culham, U.K., with operations aiming to start around 2025. The plant will demonstrate magnetized target fusion—a concept that uses a series of powerful pistons to compress plasma to fusion conditions and incorporates some of the features of magnetic confinement fusion.</p><p>Mr. Mowry, the company's CEO, says it is possible that fusion will be on the grid in the 2030s.</p><p>Some scientists, however, call that timeline overly optimistic. Frédérick Bordry, former director for accelerators and technology at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, says having nuclear fusion powering electric grids by 2030 is unrealistic, considering the technology still needs to be developed and go through licensing and regulation processes, including safety and waste-management assessments.</p><p>\"I am ready to bet a lot on that,\" he says, adding that fusion won't become viable until around 2050 to 2060.</p><p>Other critics say the hype surrounding nuclear fusion is not only illusory but also a distraction because the technology won't be ready in time to slow global warming. \"Nuclear fusion won't make an impact on the carbon-free energy mix in this century,\" let alone by 2050, says L.J. Reinders, a retired physicist and author, pointing to the lack of any substantial results over the course of almost 70 years.</p><p>Worth pursuing?</p><p>Still, fusion's supporters say the technology is worth pursuing—even if it remains a long way off. While wind and solar get more efficient and competitive every year, the world still needs a source of stable on-demand electricity that isn't dependent on the weather, especially in developing nations, they say.</p><p>\"If we hope to survive as a civilization for more than 100 years, it would be extremely shortsighted to only invest as a planet in things that could pay off in 20 years,\" ITER's Mr. Luce says.</p><p>Indeed, some big oil-and-gas companies are placing bets on nuclear fusion, eager to tap into disruptive clean-energy markets as they face mounting pressures to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>More in Alternatve Energy</p><p>* How Ready Is Alternative Energy?</p><p>* What the Experts Do to Reduce Their Carbon Footprint</p><p>* Solar Power Takes to the Water</p><p>* Green Energy's Jobs Impact</p><p>* Renewable Energy Quiz: Test Your Knowledge</p><p>* How Green Hydrogen Is Made</p><p>Last year, the U.S. oil company Chevron Corp. poured an undisclosed sum into Seattle-based nuclear-fusion startup Zap Energy Inc. Italy's Eni SpA and Norway's state-controlled oil company Equinor, meanwhile, are both invested in MIT's and Commonwealth Fusion Systems' magnet technology, aiming to expand their low-carbon portfolio and leverage their experience in getting massive projects into operations.</p><p>\"With more renewables in use in the power sector, the grid will need to continuously adjust, requiring new and different types of lower-carbon resources to maintain reliability,\" says Barbara Burger, vice president of innovation and head of technology ventures at Chevron.</p><p>Sehila Maria Gonzalez de Vicente, a fusion physicist at the International Atomic Energy Agency, says the sector is accelerating fast, with new technologies such as high-temperature superconductors, big-data analytics and 3-D printing for the manufacturing of complex components.</p><p>\"We can see how this is making fusion progress faster than ever,\" she says.</p><p>Ms. Petroni is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Barcelona.
