  "title": "Biden pushes back after Chevron CEO says oil industry has been vilified: 'He's mildly sensitive'; President's remarks come as high gasoline prices persist",
  "text": "<p>The president sounded hopeful as well: \"We ought to be able to work something out whereby they're able to increase refining capacity and still not give up on transitioning to renewable energy.\"</p><p>Biden's energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, is slated to meet with the CEOs from major refiners on Thursday as high gas prices continue to weigh on Americans. The president last week called for the companies CVX to step up their refining and criticized their profit margins.</p><p>Biden on Tuesday also offered signs that he could support suspending the federal gasoline tax, as he responded to a reporter's question about how a gas tax holiday would make it difficult to pay for major infrastructure projects.</p><p>\"We have plenty of capacity to do that,\" Biden said, referring to funding road construction.</p><p>Following those signals, the White House on Wednesday morning said the president is in fact calling for Congress to suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes for three months. He's slated to deliver a speech on the issue at 2 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>See: Biden unlikely to get OK from Congress for gas tax holiday, analysts say</p><p>Biden's remarks to reporters on Tuesday came after he delivered a speech on COVID-19 vaccines becoming available for children under 5. U.S. health officials authorized an expansion to young children on Saturday.</p><p>\"Get your shots, get your boosters, and let's be clear — elected officials shouldn't get in the way and make it more difficult for parents who want their children to be vaccinated and want to protect them and those around them. This is no time for politics,\" Biden said during his speech.</p><p>That appeared to be a reference to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, potentially Biden's opponent in the 2024 White House race. DeSantis has spoken against vaccinating the youngest Americans, contradicting what has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authorities. Florida also was the only U.S. state that didn't pre-order doses for very young kids.</p><p>See: COVID vaccines for kids under 5 — what parents need to know</p><p>Also: U.S. to start vaccinating very young children this week, and panel to recommend overhauling healthcare system</p><p>It's easy to imagine that many of the youngest kids won't get vaccinated, given that less than a third of kids aged 5 to 11 in the U.S. are fully vaccinated after becoming eligible for shots in November.</p><p>With their latest authorizations, regulatory agencies have backed the jabs developed by Moderna MRNA and by Pfizer PFE with German partner BioNTech BNTX for children aged 6 months to 4 years old.</p><p>This is an updated version of a report that was first published on June 21, 2022.</p><p>Biden pushes back after Chevron CEO says oil industry has been vilified: 'He's mildly sensitive'</p>",
