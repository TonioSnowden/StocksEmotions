  "title": "Big Oil Companies Amass Cash as Crude Tops $80 a Barrel; Exxon, Chevron and other large oil companies are reporting the strongest quarterly revenue since before the start of the pandemic and pulling back on spending",
  "text": "<p>The industry is reaping the rewards of resurgent commodity prices—U.S. crude prices have topped $80 a barrel this month for the first time since 2014—as the economy emerges from Covid-19 driven stagnation. Global energy demand is rebounding faster than anticipated, and global oil production, while still rising, is struggling to catch up with the surge in consumption.</p><p>Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if the oil industry will succumb to the temptation of plowing more money into growing production amid higher oil prices and increased demand, shrugging off austerity measures implemented during the pandemic.</p><p>After years of dismal returns, investors have sought pledges from producers that they will moderate growth and focus on shareholder payouts. Some investors want companies to diversify and pivot to renewable energy as many countries transition to cleaner energy sources amid concerns about climate change.</p><p>So far, most companies are sticking to smaller budgets and pledging to return more cash to shareholders.</p><p>Exxon raised its quarterly dividend on Wednesday by 1 cent, its first such increase since 2019, and said Friday it generated $12 billion in cash from operations. Chevron said Friday that its year-to-date capital spending is down 22% and it paid dividends of $2.6 billion, reduced debt by $5.6 billion, and repurchased $625 million of shares during the quarter.</p><p>\"Free cash flow more than covered the dividend and $4 billion of additional debt reduction,\" Exxon CEO Darren Woods said. \"With the progress made in restoring the strength of our balance sheet, this week we announced a dividend increase maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How long do you think oil prices will continue to climb? Join the conversation below.</p><p>European energy companies are also raking in cash, but say they will continue to use more of it to fund renewable-energy projects and investor payouts than growing oil and gas production.</p><p>TotalEnergies SE reported $4.6 billion in profit Thursday and said that strong cash generation from fossil fuels is enabling it to invest in growing its renewable energy and electricity businesses. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which is facing calls by activist investor Third Point LLC to split into two companies, reported a loss of $447 million Thursday, after writing off $5.2 billion linked to commodity derivatives. But the Anglo-Dutch giant said it produced $16 billion in free cash flow, its most ever, and would distribute $7 billion to shareholders from the $9.5 billion sale of its shale assets in the Permian basin to ConocoPhillips in September. BP PLC reports earnings next week.</p><p>Write to Christopher M. Matthews at christopher.matthews@wsj.com</p><p>Big Oil Companies Amass Cash as Crude Tops $80 a Barrel</p>",
