  "text": "<p>In early 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold in the UK, the government approached the private sector to help with its national response. Amazon UK agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dacc0712-6ce1-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\">use its logistics expertise and network t</a>o boost testing capacity by delivering test kits to workers in the NHS and other key workers.</p> <p>“Amazon is a retailer, but its UK team had never been involved in a project quite like this,” says Alex Simpson, UK legal director at Amazon. “Although we hadn't done that before, we very much wanted to help.</p> <p>Amazon UK's existing agreements were unfit for this type of service. Lawyers had to re-engineer contracts and existing frameworks, and engage with the data privacy regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, and standards bodies to create a new model. </p> <p>Their quick work meant the service was running by March 26 2020, just days after it was proposed.</p> <p>Amazon decided not to charge for the service through which it delivered more than 7m test kits to the homes of essential workers and the public.</p> <p>Simpson says: “It would have been very easy for any one of the team at any moment to say ‘Amazon hasn't done this before, I think it's too risky', yet no one did. The drive, determination, innovation and creativity was immense.”</p> <p>Amazon UK's lawyers are therefore named the most innovative in-house legal team in the Europe FT Innovative Lawyers awards for 2021. They tackled unfamiliar legal and data privacy issues to deliver the Covid testing distribution project and to set up in-house labs for testing Amazon employees. The team also supported the business through a period of extraordinary growth and new ventures, including the launch of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7241895a-c871-46f6-8200-b62182eced3a\"> physical stores<strong>.</strong></a></p> <p>After the disruption of the pandemic, all companies face further upheaval. And the submissions to the various award categories, showcased on the following pages, look at longer-term changes under way among in-house legal teams: advances in legal operations; renewed focus on people and skills; and the expanding influence of lawyers on the sustainability and environment, social and governance agenda.</p> <p>In the realm of legal operations, automation technologies and data analytics are transforming areas of legal work, such as how contracts are drafted and managed. Bayer, &#xa0;the German life sciences company, has shifted its entire contracting team to shared services centres, where they manage a tech-led process from initial request through the lifecycle to filing, managing and reporting. The legal team handled more than 15,000 new contract requests in the first nine months of 2021.</p> <p>For the teams at BNP Paribas bank and fintech Revolut, new risk management technologies are collecting and analysing rich data to help lawyers better advise their businesses. In the financial services industry, being able to communicate in the same language as the business and back advice up with statistics, is also valuable.</p> <p>In-house legal teams are recruiting more data, technology and process experts as they become more digital, but lawyers also need to expand their skills. “During the pandemic there has been [an evolution in] what being a business partner means for in-house lawyers,” says Oliver Searle, senior counsel at Chevron, the oil company. “Knowing the business is a given. You also need to understand the basics of process improvement, project management, and data collection.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Looking further ahead, how in-house lawyers will manage risks associated with climate change and “greenwashing” misstatements about eco-friendly policies is rising up the agenda. Nestlé has a team of five sustainability lawyers with expertise in climate change, sustainable sourcing, and human rights. Counter to the instincts of many in-house lawyers, they are seeking more regulation. They are working on promoting recycling regulations and standards for assessing carbon offsets and claims about carbon neutrality. &#xa0;</p> <p>Many individual lawyers — such as Nestlé's general counsel for sustainability, Esteban Mezzano — have been drawn to sustainability roles through personal conviction. But, as with data and tech skills, expertise in these roles is expected to become a core competency for in-house lawyers in the coming years.</p>  <h2>Case studies in best practice</h2> <p><em>Sustainability and ESG; People and skills; Strategic and risk advice; Legal operations. <br>Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGi. ‘Winner' indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award</em></p><p>Source: Yasmin Lambert  2021 'Amazon's legal team: ‘We wanted to help'' FT.com 15 October.
