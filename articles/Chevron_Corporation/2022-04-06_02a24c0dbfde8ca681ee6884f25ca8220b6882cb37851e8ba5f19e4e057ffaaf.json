  "title": "Big Oil CEOs to play defense at House hearing on ‘America's Pain at the Pump'",
  "text": "<p>Other executives slated to testify before the Democratic-run House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations include ExxonMobil&#xa0;XOM CEO Darren Woods, Devon Energy&#xa0;DVN CEO Richard Muncrief and Pioneer Natural Resources&#xa0;PXD CEO Scott Sheffield, as well as BP&#xa0;BP America's president, David Lawler, and Shell&#xa0;UK:SHEL USA's president, Gretchen Watkins.</p><p>The hearing is scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Wednesday.</p><p>ExxonMobil's Woods appears poised to make similar points as Chevron's boss.</p><p>“No single company sets the price of oil or gasoline. The market establishes the price based on available supply, and the demand for that supply,” Woods will say, according to his remarks. “Continued investment in new production to offset depletion and meet growing demand is the only way to achieve balanced markets and more affordable prices, bringing real relief at the pump.”</p><p>U.S. drivers last month paid record-high prices for gasoline, as oil CL00BRN00 spiked to its highest level in nearly 14 years following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Market experts say while there may be some cases where consumers have been overcharged at the pump for the fuel RB00, the main factor that drove retail gasoline prices to a record high in March was Russia's invasion of Ukraine, against a tight global oil market. Oil demand has recovered quickly from COVID-19 lockdowns, outpacing supply growth.</p><p>See:Why U.S. motorists suspect price gouging at the pump — and how much service stations actually profit from a gallon of gas</p><p>Also read:What can Biden and Congress do to fight inflation? ‘Simply not much of anything'</p><p>“For Democrats, high energy XLE costs are a key political vulnerability in an election year; a plurality of voters blame the party in power for high gas prices, and with limited options to directly affect prices, the Democratic strategy is focused on shifting blame onto&#xa0;oil&#xa0;companies and investors,” said analysts at Eurasia Group in a recent note.</p><p>Biden last week ordered the largest-ever release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as his administration made an effort to address high gasoline prices and pin them in large part on Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.</p><p>H.R. McMaster, who served as former President Donald Trump's national security adviser from 2017 to 2018, is slated to testify at Wednesday's hearing alongside the oil execs. The decorated combat veteran will say, according to his prepared remarks, that the U.S. “fell behind in realizing its potential to improve global energy security and reduce Vladimir Putin's ability to wage indiscriminate warfare while constraining the world's response through dependence on Russian energy supplies.”</p><p>“It is past time to work together across political parties and between the government and industry to reduce the coercive power of authoritarian regimes over energy supplies, integrate energy security and climate policies, and remove bureaucratic and regulatory obstacles to progress,” McMaster will also say.</p><p>Republicans, who are hoping to take back control of the House and Senate in November's midterm elections, have focused on blaming the recent high prices for gas and other necessities on Democratic policies that aren't friendly to fossil fuels — as well as on Democratic spending measures, such as last year's $1.9 trillion COVID relief package.</p><p>Oil futuresCL.1 dipped Wednesday, as traders prepared for further Western sanctions on Russia, while U.S. stocksSPXDJIA fell as the Federal Reserve was poised to give details for its plan to shrink its balance sheet.</p>",
