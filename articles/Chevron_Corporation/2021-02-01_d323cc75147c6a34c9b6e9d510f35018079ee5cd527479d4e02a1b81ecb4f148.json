Ms Wen praised the administration's new plan, but added: “We should be aiming for at least 2m doses a day, if not 3m.”</p> <p>Although the US was the first country in the world to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad218e91-0066-47ca-b34e-6b795865a5e5\">authorise two</a>&#xa0;vaccines, it has fallen behind in the international race to get jabs into arms.</p> <p>According to figures from <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the country has administered 26.2m doses, making it the fifth-fastest in the world to vaccinate people on a per capita basis. The US is ahead of every EU country, where supplies have been constrained, but trails Israel, the UAE, the UK and Bahrain.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mr Biden has promised 100m vaccinations will be administered in his first 100 days in office. But this level would be reached even at the pace achieved during Donald Trump's final days in office.
