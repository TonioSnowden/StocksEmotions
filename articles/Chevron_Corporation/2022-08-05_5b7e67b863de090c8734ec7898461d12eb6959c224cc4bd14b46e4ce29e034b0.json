  "title": "U.S. News: Trade Deficit Shrank 6.2% in June",
  "text": "<p>Exports grew 1.7% to $261 billion, helped largely by higher shipments of energy and food products. Imports fell 0.3% to $340 billion, reflecting sizable declines in American purchases of autos and food items.</p><p>International trade has been a resilient spot for the U.S. as broader economic growth slowed and inflation soared. The war in Ukraine has caused countries to seek alternatives to Russian energy, pushing up demand and prices for U.S. energy products. U.S. exports of industrial supplies and materials, which include natural gas and petroleum products, rose 6.5% in June from a month earlier. Also included in the category is gold, whose exports rose by more than $1 billion to nearly $5 billion.</p><p>Higher oil prices have been a boon for the energy industry, with Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC reporting a record in collective profits in the second quarter.</p><p>Imports fell in June after rising slightly in May, a trend economists expect to continue in the coming months as U.S. growth decelerates. While consumers have continued to spend at a steady pace even as inflation cut into their purchasing power, their sentiment has deteriorated. A July survey of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan showed little change from June, when it hit historic lows.</p><p>The labor market has also shown several signs of cooling, though businesses have continued to hire.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund lowered its forecast for U.S. economic growth for 2022 to 2.3% from its April forecast for 3.7%. The U.S. economy grew 5.7% in 2021.</p><p>U.S. gross domestic product fell 0.9% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, following a 1.6% drop in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. Trade contributed to the economy with exports jumping 18% while imports increased 3.1%.</p><p>Economists say, however, that trade's contribution to U.S. growth will likely wane as economic woes continue to deepen around the world, cooling demand. The dollar's strength could also weigh on U.S. exports by making American products more expensive overseas when measured in local currencies.</p><p>\"With the [Federal Reserve] poised to move policy into restrictive territory in the coming months, and inflation remaining elevated through year-end, we expect the ongoing slowdown in the economy to further arrest trade flows in the second half of 2022,\" Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, a London research firm, said in a note.</p><p>Oil prices rose sharply in the first half of the year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The price of Brent crude hit a high of $123 a barrel in early June, before retreating to below $100 by early August.</p><p>During the first half of 2022, the U.S.'s petroleum-product exports rose 79% in value and 11% in volume.</p><p>Even though the U.S. remained a net importer of crude oil in 2021, higher domestic production and increased exports lowered net oil imports in 2021 to the second-lowest annual level since 1985, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. is a net exporter of natural gas.</p><p>Injecting further uncertainty about international trade is the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, the world's predominant supplier of advanced semiconductors, key materials for everything from cellphones and autos to military equipment. Protesting a visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), China on Thursday started live-fire drills near Taiwan, raising concerns that they could disrupt commercial shipping.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S.'s trade deficit with China increased 17% from a month earlier to $36.9 billion in June, as exports fell slightly while imports rose 11% to $48.6 billion.</p><p>Despite the U.S.'s trade restrictions as part of sanctions against Russia, goods continue to flow between the two countries. During the first half of this year, imports from Russia totaled $11.2 billion, down 21% from a year earlier. Exports fell to $1.2 billion, a third of the amount a year earlier. In June, the U.S. imported goods worth $661 million from Russia, led by iron and aluminum products, fertilizers and crabs.</p><p>---</p><p>Anthony DeBarros contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
