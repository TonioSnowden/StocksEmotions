  "text": "<p>Some analysts said Venezuela's oil production could increase by about 400,000 barrels a day in a matter of months to a year. That isn't nearly enough to offset up to 2 million barrels of daily production the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies said they would cut Wednesday.</p><p>Venezuela is likely to eventually hit a ceiling of about 1 million barrels a day in the medium term, still well below production levels before the U.S. sanctions, said Fernando Ferreira, an analyst at Rapidan Energy.</p><p>\"To get above that level would be challenging,\" Mr. Ferreira said. \"They'll have to do a lot of refurbishing of the oil infrastructure, and that would require a lot of investment.\"</p><p>The Biden administration is discussing a move to scale down sanctionson Venezuela's regime if the authoritarian President Nicol√°s Maduro agrees to negotiate with the U.S.-backed opposition to organize free and fair presidential elections in 2024 and commits to other changes, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com</p><p>Chevron Braces for Tough Job Restarting Venezuela's Damaged Oil Fields</p>",
