  "text": "<p>Enter the Cause of Action Institute, which sued the Commerce Department (which oversees the NMFS) in 2020 on behalf of fishermen in New Jersey. The suit claims Congress never authorized the bureaucratic cost-shift to the industry.</p><p>The 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Act governs fishing in federal waters and allows the fisheries service to impose monitors. But nowhere in the law does Congress give the service power to force herring fishermen to fund the program. Congress has authorized industry-funded monitoring in other, specific contextsâ€”including for certain North Pacific fisheries, and for foreign vessels. It did not do the same here.</p><p>The fisheries service argues it has the legal right to impose the costs because the law is silent on the matter. The government points to language authorizing it to take steps that are \"necessary and appropriate\" to manage fisheries. Put another way, unless Congress explicitly prohibits an action, an agency can proceed.</p><p>The case has moved up the appellate chain, and in August a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the government. Judges Sri Srinivasan and Judith Rogers cited the Supreme Court's Chevron deference standard, finding that the law \"through its silence, leaves room for agency discretion.\"</p><p>But Judge Justin Walker noted in dissent that this is a principle with no limit. He mused whether the fisheries service could find it \"necessary\" for fishermen to drive their federal monitors back and forth to the office to save on government gas bills, or whether it could demand fishermen finance other bureaucratic costs.</p><p>The decision removes one of the few practical constraints on regulatory excess: a lack of resources. If government can write rules and require their targets to pay the costs without explicit Congressional approval, there will be no limit on bureaucratic discretion.</p><p>The herring fishermen are asking the Supreme Court to hear the case and are represented by former Solicitor General Paul Clement. In West Virginia v. EPA this year, the Court used its major questions doctrine to rein in egregious regulatory overreach. But it has left Chevron as a largely unchecked license for regulators who can still do great harm without Congressional assent. Silence shouldn't be a bureaucratic license to wreck livelihoods.</p><p>Caught in the Bureaucratic Net</p>",
