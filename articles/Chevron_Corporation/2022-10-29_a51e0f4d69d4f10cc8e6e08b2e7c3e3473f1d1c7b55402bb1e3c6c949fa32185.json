  "text": "<p>Seven years ago, in a column on the dangers of overvaluation, I included a specific warning about Facebook from Chris Brightman, CEO and CIO of Research Affiliates. Facebook is the \"poster child of our new tech bubble,\" he said then.</p><p>To make his point, Brightman bet that Facebook stock (now Meta) would be beaten by oil company Chevron CVX. This was a gutsy prediction since, unlike Meta, Chevron was out of favor at that time. In contrast to Facebook's trailing P/E ratio of 92, Chevron's P/E was just 9.</p><p>Brightman nevertheless has handily won the bet. Since the date of my column in August 2015, Chevron stock has produced a 15.6% annualized total return, according to FactSet, versus just 4.4% for Meta.</p><p>The source of Meta's dramatically lower return was not that the company was unprofitable. On the contrary, since Brightman made his bet it has produced a cumulative total of $139 billion of net income, versus $41 billion for Chevron.</p><p>Instead, the reason Brightman won his bet was that Meta investors had sky-high expectations for the company's earnings and Chevron investors had low ones. It wouldn't have taken much of a hiccup to cause Facebook to come up short, or much good news for Chevron's stock to surprise to the upside.</p><p>Long-term evidence</p><p>Facebook and Chevron are just two stocks, but their experience is consistent with the relative returns produced over the past 70 years of the highest and lowest P/E stocks.</p><p>This is illustrated in the chart below, which plots the returns since 1951 of two hypothetical portfolios. The first contained the 10% of U.S. stocks with the highest P/E ratios, while the second contained the decile of stocks with the lowest such ratios. The portfolios were reconstituted every June 30 based on trailing 12-month earnings. The returns were calculated by Dartmouth College professor Ken French.</p><p>The chart shows that the lowest P/E stocks hugely outperformed the stocks with the highest ratios. It isn't even close: The lowest P/E portfolio beat the highest P/E portfolio by 6.1 annualized percentage points. To be sure, French's calculations do adjust for transaction costs. But unless the low P/E portfolio undergoes significantly more transactions than the high P/E portfolio, which I doubt, transaction costs shouldn't have a marked impact on the difference in their returns.</p><p>Brightman's latest bet</p><p>Given Brightman's success with his 2015 projection that Chevron would outperform Meta, I reached out to him again for the contrarian bet he would make today. He offered not just one, but two:</p><p>* CVS CVS over Tesla TSLA. Brightman points out that the former stock recently had a forward P/E ratio of just 10, versus 37 for Tesla.</p><p>* The U.K. stock market over U.S. equities. Brightman points out that the FTSE 100 index UK:UKX currently sports a cyclically-adjusted price/earnings ratio of 13, versus 26 for the S&amp;P 500 SPX.</p><p>Brightman stresses that neither of these is a short-term bet, since stocks' relative returns over \"a quarter or even a year\" are \"mostly random noise.\" However, \"over 5 or ten years valuation is a strong signal.\"</p><p>Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
