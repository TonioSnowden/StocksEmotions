  "text": "<p>ExxonMobil's shareholders on Wednesday voted to change the supermajor's board, delivering a historic rebuke to management, as changes sweeping though the global oil sector reached the top of its most famous company. </p> <p>A majority of shareholders selected at least two of the four directors nominated by Engine No 1, a hedge fund that has waged a proxy campaign since December, saying the oil and gas group's focus on fossil fuels had put it at “existential risk”.</p> <p>The activist victory marked a huge breakthrough in campaigners' efforts to put the climate crisis at the centre of American capitalism and the global oil business, said supporters.</p> <p>“This is a landmark moment for Exxon and for the industry, and will accelerate needed change in the sector,” said Andrew Logan, senior director for oil and gas at Ceres, which co-ordinates investor climate action. </p> <p>“Nothing focuses a director's mind like the possibility that they might lose their job. Today that risk became very real,” he added.</p> <p>Exxon revealed preliminary results of the vote at the end of a drawn-out annual general meeting that featured an unusual hour-long intermission and a lengthy question and answer session with Darren Woods, chair and chief executive. <br><br>Shareholders elected Gregory Goff, former chief executive of oil refining company Andeavor, and Kaisa Hietala, a former oil executive who helped make refiner Neste the world's biggest producer of renewable diesel. </p> <p>Woods said he had “heard from shareholders about their desire to catalyse changes . . . and we are well positioned to respond”.</p> <p>The results added to a bruising day for the business of Big Oil. A court in the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340501e2-e0cd-4ea5-b388-9af0d9a74ce2\">told</a> Royal Dutch Shell to aggressively cut its emissions, while shareholders in Chevron, the US's second-biggest oil company after Exxon, convincingly voted for a resolution calling on the company to cut pollution from the products its sells. </p> <p>The Exxon vote followed months of pressure from Engine No 1, which had urged the company cut capital spending and focus “on accelerating rather than deferring the energy transition” to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bf04fff-5b2f-4d96-a4ea-ff55e029f18e\">cleaner energy</a>.</p> <p>The hedge fund holds a stake worth just $54m in a company with $248bn in market capitalisation. Exxon's shares rose 0.7 per cent to $58.64 after the votes were tallied Wednesday. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f73a55b-ac59-4737-b7c8-2f575d32920b\">proxy battle</a> was expensive, with Exxon saying it would spend at least $35m on shareholder solicitations and Engine No 1 expecting $30m. The company has even contacted some small shareholders in an attempt to galvanise opposition to the hedge fund.</p><p>Source: Derek Brower, US Energy Editor 2021 'ExxonMobil shareholders hand board seats to activist nominees' FT.com 26 May.
