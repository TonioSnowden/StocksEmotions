  "text": "<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a1294b4-b412-473c-a628-0015ee786cf0\">putting boots on the ground</a> in Kazakhstan. Civil disorder has broken out in the Central Asian nation noted for its wild beauty, corrupt authoritarianism and mineral wealth. A mooted doubling in the price of liquefied petroleum gas used for heating during freezing Kazakh winters triggered protests. They now channel broader discontent. </p> <p>Awkwardly, western consumers may now depend on Russian troops to stop a revolution from rocking volatile commodity prices. Oil and natural gas are Kazakhstan's key exports by value. It also produces about 40 per cent of the world's uranium supply.</p> <p>President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called for Russian help when dissent persisted even after he cancelled the LPG price increase and fired ministers.</p> <p>One of his aims will be to reassure big foreign investors. Huge local minerals groups such as Kazakhmys and ENRC have delisted from the London market. But £11bn fintech Kaspi is quoted there alongside Swiss-based miner Glencore, which controls zinc miner Kazzinc. Canadian uranium miner Cameco and US oil group Chevron are also active in Kazakhstan.</p> <p>A sharp fuel price increase may look odd given Kazakhstan's energy abundance, but cheap fuel is seen as a perk of citizenship there. Petrol at 50 cents per litre, for instance, costs less than in Russia and about half that in the US, according to analysts at BCS. </p> <p>The country produces meaningful amounts of crude, about 1.8m barrels a day, a fifth of Russia's output. Riots in Almaty contributed to a small rebound in Brent prices this week, back more than $81 a barrel. </p> <p>The thinly traded uranium spot market is more vulnerable. On Wednesday the price had jumped 7 per cent. This follows a year in which uranium has climbed by half, approaching decade highs on growing nuclear bullishness. Kazakh output is triple that of number two producer Australia.</p> <p>News of Russian intervention pushed shares of London-listed specialist uranium fund Yellow Cake down 3.3 per cent on Thursday, giving back most of the previous day's gains. Kaspi depositary receipts, which had slumped by a third, rallied only 3 per cent.</p> <p>Russian interventions in landlocked Asian states have a poor record of success. The semi-retirement in 2019 of Tokayev's predecessor, former authoritarian leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, has failed to stabilise mineral-rich Kazakhstan. Any commodity watcher secretly relieved by the arrival of Russian paratroopers should be very careful what they wish for.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Kazakhstan/commodities: Russian troops provide cold comfort' FT.com 6 January.
