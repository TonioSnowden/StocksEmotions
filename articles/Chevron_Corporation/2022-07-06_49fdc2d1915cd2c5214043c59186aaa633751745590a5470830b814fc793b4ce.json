  "title": "Late Rally Propels Nasdaq, S&P --- Economic-growth worries pressure blue-chip Dow index; energy stocks fall",
  "text": "<p>Equity prices declined for much of Tuesday morning before rallying back in afternoon trading. The S&amp;P and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as low as 2.2% and 2.4%, respectively.</p><p>Gains in the S&amp;P's communications services, consumer discretionary and information technology sectors pushed the broad-market index into the green for the day. The energy sector recorded the largest decline of any sector, down about 4%, as oil prices fell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron each fell about 3%.</p><p>U.S. stocks tend to perform well in July, history shows, but this year investors say they are bracing for more pain. Traders are focused on stubborn inflation that has forced central banks around the world to aggressively tighten monetary policy. Economic data showing declines in metrics ranging from factory output to retail spending have exacerbated concerns that the U.S. economy could tumble into a recession.</p><p>Gold prices fell 1.9%, while the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies, advanced 1%.</p><p>The euro slipped about 1.5%, falling to a nearly 20-year low on concerns that the eurozone may be nearing an energy shock that could cause the bloc to enter a recession. The euro recently traded at $1.0265, putting it within striking distance of reaching parity.</p><p>Early Tuesday, reports that President Biden is expected to roll back some tariffs on Chinese imports initially provided stocks some reprieve, sending futures higher in premarket trading on hopes that the changes could help rein in inflation. As the session continued, selling pressure deepened.</p><p>\"The market is desperate for good news,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Even with the possibility of a rollback of tariffs he said, investors are asking, how it might address mounting recession fears and inflation.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.808%, from 2.901% Friday.</p><p>Investors this week are awaiting the Friday release of the June jobs report, which will shed insight on the economy. So far, the job market has shown little sign of faltering this year -- offering one encouraging sign for the economy -- even as other data in recent weeks have pointed to an economic slowdown.</p><p>Investors could be disappointed this month when major companies begin reporting second-quarter results.</p><p>\"The first shoe that dropped was the Fed trying to get control over inflation,\" said Cliff Corso, president and chief investment officer at Advisors Asset Management. \"The second shoe and the challenge for the second half is earnings, which haven't really been adjusted down to coincide with a slowing [gross domestic product] forecast.\"</p><p>Money managers and strategists also will be monitoring developments surrounding the Biden administration's plans for tariffs and what impact they could have on inflation and the economy. On Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke by videoconference about topics including the tariffs, marking the first time the two policy makers have spoken since October 2021.</p><p>Economists say removing Chinese tariffs isn't likely to have a dramatic impact on inflation. Any rollback may not mark a fundamental change in the U.S.-China relationship or the countries' economic outlooks, some investors said.</p><p>\"The size of the tariff reduction may not fundamentally change the U.S. inflation or China export outlooks,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Ford Motor fell 12 cents, or 1.1%, to $11.20 after it reported a 27% decrease in sales in June from a year earlier. Tesla rose 2.5%, or $17.41, to $699.20. The electric-car maker said Saturday that its vehicle deliveries fell quarter over quarter for the first time in more than two years after the company had to temporarily shut down its largest factory, in Shanghai, because of local Covid-19 curbs.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 2.1%, its largest single-day decline since June 16. Uniper SE, one of Europe's largest utilities, fell 9.5% as it continues bailout talks.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 1.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%, China's CSI 300 was down 1.1% and South Korea's Kospi was down 1%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.2%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
