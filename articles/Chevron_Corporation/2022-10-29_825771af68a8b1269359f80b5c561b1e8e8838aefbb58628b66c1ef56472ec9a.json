  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Dow Jumps More Than 800 Points",
  "text": "<p>Octobers are often billed as bad luck by traders, since the stock-market crash of 1929 and Black Monday both took place during the month. This year, however, the Dow industrials are on track to finish October up more than 14%, which would be its best monthly performance since January 1976.</p><p>This week's gains are a testament to how the group of companies known as FAANG -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet -- no longer drive the performance of major stock indexes as they did for years. Those companies' shares all are down significantly in 2022, and Meta, Amazon and Alphabet all fell sharply this week after reporting lackluster earnings.</p><p>Amazon's shares slid $7.55, or 6.8%, to $103.41 Friday following downbeat guidance for its current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping period. Meta's shares edged $1.26, or 1.3%, higher to $99.20 after losing nearly 25% on Thursday following disappointing quarterly results. Apple was a bright spot, leading the Dow industrials higher with gains of $10.94, or 7.6%, to $155.74.</p><p>Meanwhile, real estate, financials and staples were some of the biggest contributors to the indexes' weekly gains. All but one S&amp;P 500 sector ended the week higher, with communication services stocks the outlier. Only the consumer discretionary sector finished Friday in the red.</p><p>\"Since the financial crisis, you've had this massive rally in tech stocks on the combination of cheap energy, very low interest rates and a massive acceleration in the adoption of digital services,\" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. \"Now, on the backside of this pandemic, with interest rates and inflation suddenly out of the bottle, you've seen a drastic repricing of tech stocks. A lot of investors are beginning to question their portfolios.\"</p><p>Investors worry that a U.S. economic slowdown is beginning to take root as consumers and businesses pull back amid stubbornly high inflation and tighter central-bank policy.</p><p>\"My gut feeling is that tech companies are leading where other companies will follow in the coming months,\" said Dan Boardman-Weston, chief executive officer of BRI Wealth Management.</p><p>Not all third-quarter earnings have been bad. Apple reported record revenue in its latest quarter, while oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron on Friday posted some of their highest-ever quarterly profits. Results from some U.S. banks and industrial bellwether Caterpillar have also been surprisingly resilient.</p><p>Still, at roughly the midpoint for the latest quarter's earnings reports, results haven't been encouraging. The blended earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 in the third quarter, which includes both reported and estimated earnings, is 2.2%, according to FactSet. That would represent the lowest year-over-year earnings growth rate since 2020.</p><p>Recent figures on the strength of the U.S. economy have been mixed. Data Friday showed a stronger-than-expected monthly rise in consumer spending in September. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal-consumption expenditures index, edged slightly lower last month from August. A separate report showed worker pay and benefits rose 5% in the third quarter from a year before, marking a slight cooling from the prior quarter.</p><p>A day earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew in the third quarter, though consumer and business spending faltered.</p><p>Bond yields have eased in recent days as investors reassess their expectations for more rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The central bank is meeting next week and is expected to deliver another 0.75-percentage-point increase, but some investors expect the Fed will ease up on the pace thereafter.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury moved up to 4.009% Friday, from 3.938% on Thursday.</p>",
