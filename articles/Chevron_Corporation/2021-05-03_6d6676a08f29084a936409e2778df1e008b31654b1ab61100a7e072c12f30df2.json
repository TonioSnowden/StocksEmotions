  "title": "Lawsuit Without End: 28 Years So Far  ---  Chevron lost an Ecuador pollution case. U.S. courts deemed it fraudulent. The fight goes on.  ----  By Sara Randazzo",
  "text": "<p>    Chevron Corp. was fixated on roses. </p><p>   The giant U.S. oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world's poorest countries, including Ecuador. </p><p>   A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind. </p><p>   Chevron had since proved the verdict fraudulent, it told the U.S. Trade Representative. But Ecuador refused to render it unenforceable despite an order to do that from an international arbitration tribunal. Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant \"acts of defiance\" would tell the world the U.S. rewards bad behavior, the oil company said. </p><p>   Chevron lost the war of the roses. But it still hasn't paid a cent of the Ecuadorean judgment, and says it won't stop legally battling until it can ensure that it never has to. </p><p>   \"We're going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it on the ice,\" a former Chevron general counsel, Charles James, said before his retirement in 2010, a remark that became a watchword at the company. </p><p>   His successor, R. Hewitt Pate, said this spring that \"only the government of Ecuador could deliver a final resolution of this case,\" by nullifying the verdict. </p><p>   Big companies that see lawsuits against them as unfounded often reach a point, after losing a court ruling or two, when settling seems the sensible course. Chevron never did. Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights on. </p><p>   Chevron's opponents also refuse to back down, making the case what appears to be the oil industry's longest-running legal slugfest. Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron's estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff, advisers' and attorneys' time. Executives and lawyers who worked on the case have retired or died since it began. </p><p>   Well before Chevron lost the damage verdict in 2011, it set out to turn the tables on the litigants. It subpoenaed or sued dozens of people who had helped the plaintiffs' side, legal records show, and unearthed damaging video clips about the plaintiffs' legal team's activities from documentary-film outtakes. Chevron's lawyers obtained the personal notes of the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Steven Donziger. </p><p>   It scored a victory in 2014 when a federal judge found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and ghost-wrote the verdict. </p><p>   Mr. Donziger's New York law license was revoked. He  is confined to his apartment, facing trial over his refusal to turn over records to Chevron. </p><p>   In December, he shouted out his window to supporters gathered below to mark his 500th day of house arrest. \"What is happening to me is a sign of our success,\" he said, using a bullhorn: \"This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy.\" Below his window hung a sign saying \"SOS Free Steven!\" </p><p>   The company's strategy \"is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,\" Mr. Donziger said in an interview. </p><p>   Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdict -- a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague -- to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador. </p><p>    Inigo Salvador Crespo, an Ecuador justice official, declined to comment. </p><p>   Chevron officials say they have punched back so hard, for so long, because they found fraud in the litigation and because Ecuador in the 1990s granted a release from liability after a cleanup. </p><p>   To some longtime observers of the case, it looks more like a grudge match with Mr. Donziger. \"They're making an example of him,\" said Ted Folkman, an attorney who has closely followed the battle. </p><p>   Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the other side won't acknowledge court findings. </p><p>   Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the plaintiffs, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling. </p><p>   \"Chevron wants to talk about the injustices they have suffered. Steven wants to talk about the injustice he is suffering. Who is talking about the people on the ground and how they've been affected?\" said Judith Kimerling, a professor at the City University of New York's Queens College, whose research in Ecuador inspired the original lawsuit. </p><p>   Chevron inherited the dispute in 2001 when it acquired Texaco Inc., which operated in Ecuador from the 1960s to 1990 with government-run Petroecuador. They drilled in an area of the Amazon occupied by native people and gave it the name Lago Agrio. </p><p>   Texaco spent $40 million on local cleanup and obtained a liability release from Ecuador's government in the 1990s. </p><p>   A group of Amazonians sued Texaco in 1993 in federal court in New York, saying they were sickened by water and air polluted from the oil operations. Texaco said the case belonged in Ecuador, and a new suit was filed there in 2003. A new Ecuadorean law let people sue not only for harm to themselves but also for environmental damage. </p><p>   Mr. Donziger became the face of the case in Ecuador. He rallied activists in front of the Lago Agrio courthouse. A documentary film crew followed him as he barged into judges' offices to make demands. </p><p>   Around 2009, Chevron adopted a strategy of trying to show plaintiffs' lawyers were acting improperly. It hired Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, whose lawyers probed every aspect of plaintiffs' case. Using an obscure court process called Section 1782, Gibson Dunn gained access to troves of documents from people who had worked with the plaintiffs. </p><p>   Chevron secured the outtakes of a documentary film on the case and turned up clips such as one where Mr. Donziger recounted a favorite quote to colleagues: \"Facts do not exist. Facts are created.\" </p><p>   It amassed evidence that Mr. Donziger and his team had pressured Ecuadorean judges to rule in their favor and secretly wrote the bulk of the report of a court-appointed outside expert who said Chevron should pay $27.3 billion. </p><p>   Mr. Donziger said the plaintiffs' activities followed Ecuadorean court customs. </p><p>   Gibson Dunn pitched federal prosecutors in New York on the idea of criminally prosecuting Mr. Donziger. When they declined,  Chevron sued Mr. Donziger and his team civilly under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, often used against mobsters. It filed the RICO suit on Feb. 1, 2011. </p><p>   Two weeks later, a judge in Ecuador handed down the verdict against Chevron, then doubled the damages to $19 billion after Chevron refused an order to apologize. It was later reduced back to $9.5 billion but otherwise upheld by the Ecuadorean courts. </p><p>   With Chevron having no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to collect in places where the oil company operated, such as Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Chevron hired lawyers around the world to resist such efforts. </p><p>   Its strategy was vindicated in March 2014 when, after a trial, a federal judge issued a 485-page opinion concluding Mr. Donziger and his team had submitted false evidence in Ecuador, paid off a court-appointed expert and ghost-written much of his opinion and promised $500,000 to an Ecuadorean judge to rule in their favor. The ruling by Judge Lewis Kaplan had ramifications: Mr. Donziger couldn't try to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment in the U.S. or  profit from it; he had to relinquish his 6.3% interest. Mr. Donziger appealed the ruling and lost. </p><p>   Chevron lawyers filed motions every time they thought Mr. Donziger might be violating the judge's orders. An example was when he asked a hedge-fund firm to finance efforts to collect the damages in return for a share of them. </p><p>   A portfolio manager at Elliott Management Corp. said Mr. Donziger told him the plaintiffs had raised $33 million, and 15% to 20% of the damage award was committed to investors and others. Elliott turned him down, the portfolio manager said in a sworn affidavit. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment. </p><p>   Chevron also told the court Mr. Donziger had hired an executive coach and agreed to pay him 0.007% of what was collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share. Chevron said that violated the ban on his profiting from the verdict. </p><p>   In May 2019, Judge Kaplan found Mr. Donziger in civil contempt of court. The judge said he violated orders by not turning over all of his electronic devices and email accounts for imaging, for failing to relinquish his stake in the damage award and for his deal with the executive coach. </p><p>   Later, Judge Kaplan ordered a trial to determine if Mr. Donziger should be held in criminal contempt of court for  ignoring the orders. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined to pursue the criminal matter. In an unusual procedure, Judge Kaplan then appointed a private lawyer to serve as prosecutor and assigned another U.S. district judge, Loretta Preska, to handle the case, which is set for trial starting May 10. It was Judge Preska who put Mr. Donziger under house arrest. </p><p>   A state appellate court had suspended Mr. Donziger's law license. He requested a hearing. There, 15 witnesses testified about the honest human-rights lawyer they said they knew, among them Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, a co-founder of Greenpeace and an indigenous Ecuadorean leader. Chevron sent observers. </p><p>   A New York judicial official found Mr. Donziger posed no threat to the public and recommended letting him keep his license. \"The extent of his pursuit by Chevron is so extravagant, and at this point so unnecessary and punitive,\" the official said. </p><p>   New York state's appellate court said the official was too dismissive of the severity of the misconduct. It disbarred Mr. Donziger in August. He is seeking an appeal. </p><p></p>",
