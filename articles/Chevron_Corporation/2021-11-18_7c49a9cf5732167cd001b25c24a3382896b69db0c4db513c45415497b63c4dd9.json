  "title": "President Calls for Inquiry Into Price Of Gas --- Biden, in letter, alleges wrongdoing by energy firms, though experts see a lack of evidence",
  "text": "<p>The president said gasoline prices had risen about 3% from a month earlier even as the price of unfinished gasoline, which hasn't yet been blended with other liquids for use in vehicles, was down more than 5%.</p><p>\"This unexplained large gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price at the pump is well above the pre-pandemic average,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, wrote. \"Meanwhile, the largest oil-and-gas companies in America are generating significant profits off higher energy prices.\"</p><p>The president called on Ms. Khan to \"consider whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump,\" asking her to \"bring all of the Commission's tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing.\"</p><p>FTC spokeswoman Lindsay Kryzak said: \"The FTC is concerned about this issue, and we are looking into it.\"</p><p>ClearView Energy Partners, an independent research firm, found that retail gasoline prices were closely correlated with unfinished gasoline prices over the last 10 years, but they sometimes diverged. The firm found 13 instances over the past decade where monthly prices for unfinished gasoline went down while retail gasoline prices went up.</p><p>\"This gives us some reason to suggest that today's FTC investigation might end up like past such efforts: with limited evidence to validate assertions of market manipulation and price gouging,\" the firm said.</p><p>Rapidan Energy Group, a research and consulting firm, analyzed the disparity between unfinished gasoline and retail pump prices cited in Mr. Biden's letter and said the difference wasn't out of the normal range.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute lobbying group called the letter a \"distraction from the fundamental market shift that is taking place,\" adding that demand has increased as the economy picks back up.</p><p>\"Rather than launching investigations on markets that are regulated and closely monitored on a daily basis or pleading with OPEC to increase supply, we should be encouraging the safe and responsible development of American-made oil and natural gas,\" Frank Macchiarola, the group's senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, said in a statement, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p><p>BP PLC chief U.S. economist Michael Cohen said that gas prices reflect \"the balance between oil supply and demand.\" A Chevron Corp. spokesman declined to comment and referred questions to API. An Exxon Mobil Corp. representative didn't respond to a request to comment on the letter. Royal Dutch Shell PLC declined to provide a comment.</p><p>Facing political fallout from high gas prices, past presidents of both parties have called for similar investigations into alleged price gouging and manipulation in the market. The efforts rarely result in federal action against companies, though some state attorneys general have taken action against gas-station owners for alleged gouging.</p><p>The commission looked into gasoline price manipulation after higher prices following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, examining the behavior of refiners, wholesalers and retailers. It found no evidence of widespread market manipulation.</p><p>\"Demanding that the FTC investigate gouging is the oldest tool in the tool kit,\" said Bob McNally, who served as an energy adviser to President George W. Bush and is the founder of Rapidan Energy Group.</p><p>Mr. McNally and some other analysts questioned the merit of the letter's allegations. \"I think it's a stretch to pick one month's data and conclude it's evidence of anticompetitive behavior\" because of the historic price volatility of unfinished gasoline and pump prices, he said.</p><p>Many analysts said that gasoline prices have risen along with climbing oil prices, spurred by an uptick in global economic activity and moderate oil-production growth. Current gasoline price increases relative to oil prices are in line with historic trends, these analysts said.</p><p>U.S. gasoline prices in October averaged $3.38 a gallon while U.S. oil prices averaged $81.48 a barrel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The last time U.S. gasoline prices reached similar levels -- $3.25 a gallon in October 2014 -- U.S. oil prices were $84.40 a barrel. U.S. oil production sharply increased since last year to about 11.4 million barrels a day, according to the EIA, but is still well below pre-pandemic levels of around 13 million barrels a day.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his senior advisers have been weighing policy options in response to high gas prices. Gasoline prices were up more than 60% in mid-November from a year earlier, according to the EIA.</p><p>Mr. Biden has called on OPEC to increase production to ease shortages and lower prices. OPEC has so far rebuffed those requests.</p><p>As gas prices soared in recent months, some of Mr. Biden's senior advisers have urged him to release oil from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but the administration hasn't done so. Asked about the impact on prices of an SPR release, Stephen Nalley, the acting EIA administrator, told a Senate committee this week, \"Ultimately the amount of impact would be relatively short-lived.\"</p><p>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: Biden's Lesson in Economics\" -- WSJ Dec. 3, 2021)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
