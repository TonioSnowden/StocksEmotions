  "title": "U.S. Plots  Response  To OPEC  After Cut  In Output  ---  Steps weighed include  retaliation against the  cartel and moving to  curb nation's exports  ----  By Timothy Puko and Benoit Morenne",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- OPEC's decision to slash oil production has Washington considering responses that could include measures aimed at breaking the cartel's hold on markets or limiting U.S. oil exports should shortages emerge. </p><p>   The cutback by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies is the latest dilemma for President Biden, who has sought to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels while at the same time keeping consumer prices in check. </p><p>   A long fall in gasoline prices has started to reverse, and this week's decision by OPEC to cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day threatens to push prices higher again just weeks before the Nov. 8 midterm elections. </p><p>   Mr. Biden and lawmakers have decried the decision, raising the prospect of retaliatory action against OPEC and Saudi Arabia, its largest producer. Congressional leaders are threatening legislation that would charge OPEC members in front of the World Trade Organization or subject them to U.S. antitrust law. </p><p>   The OPEC production cut threatens to accelerate an overhaul of U.S.-Saudi relations that began to take shape with the rise of King Salman's son, Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince in 2017. Some House Democrats are also saying they will propose legislation to mandate the removal of U.S. troops and defense systems from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. </p><p>   \"There are a lot of alternatives and we haven't made up our minds yet,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said outside the White House on Thursday. </p><p>   Administration officials have been exploring export bans on gasoline and diesel as a potential response to worst-case scenarios if shortages emerge across the country. Officials have acknowledged that isn't an ideal option, and oil industry analysts said it could backfire by spreading fear or creating bottlenecks in the markets that raise prices themselves. </p><p>   The White House also called on U.S. oil producers to increase output. But their appetite for doing so has been hamstrung by Wall Street investors who have asked that companies focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than reinvesting it in more production. </p><p>   \"They believe that there's a finite period in which they have to operate,\" Bart Melek, global head of commodity markets strategy at investment bank TD Securities, said of U.S. oil-and-gas producers. </p><p>   U.S. oil output has been mostly flat this year, with producers churning out about 12 million barrels a day in the last week of September, less than a 3% increase from early January, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration. </p><p>   Some investors concerned about hydrocarbons' carbon footprint have also pulled out of their investments, leaving the industry starved for capital, analysts said. </p><p>   Also limiting room for production growth are rising costs facing oil-and-gas companies, as inflation has hit everything from wages to their ability to procure supplies. </p><p>   In Washington, lawmakers focused their attention on Saudi Arabia, saying the country has aligned with Russia after its attack on Ukraine and that that makes the kingdom unfit for U.S. support. </p><p>   \"The royal Saudi family has never been a trustworthy ally,\" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chamber's second-ranking Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter Thursday. \"It's time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance.\" </p><p>   As a candidate, Mr. Biden had threatened similar action against Saudi Arabia, but he moved to soften that stance this year amid fears over high energy prices and Saudi Arabia's drift toward Russia and China. But a summit Mr. Biden agreed to with the kingdom's leaders in Saudi Arabia didn't lead to a Saudi pledge to boost oil production, and the decision just three months later for a dramatic cut in oil production was another blow. </p><p>   The solutions offered so far risk pushing the kingdom further into the embrace of U.S. rivals. Riyadh is surprised at \"the hysteria\" coming from Washington over oil prices, said Ali Shihabi, a commentator with ties to the Saudi government. </p><p>   The Saudis no longer sell much oil to the U.S. and are instead the biggest supplier to China. That limits the U.S. options for getting help from Riyadh to lower energy prices, said David Ottaway, Middle East fellow at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. </p><p>   \"Certainly they don't give a damn about pressure from Biden, and they don't feel beholden to the Biden administration for anything,\" he said. </p><p>   Saudi Arabia remains one of the biggest buyers of U.S. weapons and is a key partner for the U.S. military and intelligence community in the Middle East. The Saudis and the U.S. coordinate closely on counter-terrorism operations. </p><p>   Mr. Biden has already overseen the release of nearly a third of what was more than 600 million barrels of the federal government's strategic reserves as of November 2021, in a bid that analysts say helped ease surging energy prices. </p><p>   But that brings the reserves down near levels the U.S. may not be able to go below without violating international agreements. And it limits the president's capacity to respond if prices surge again, analysts said, just a month before midterm elections in which inflation and energy prices are a key issue. </p><p>   Separately, the Biden administration is preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime to allow Chevron Corp. to resume pumping oil there. </p><p></p>",
