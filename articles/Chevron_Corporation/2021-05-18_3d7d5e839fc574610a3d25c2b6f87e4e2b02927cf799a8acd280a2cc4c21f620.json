  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court handed the city of Baltimore a preliminary setback in its bid to sue more than 20 multinational oil-and-gas companies on allegations they contributed to climate change and misled the public. </p><p>   Baltimore filed the 2018 lawsuit in Maryland state court, alleging energy companies failed to warn the public about the dangers of their products. The city says it has suffered climate-change-related injuries, including from rising sea levels and extreme weather, and seeks to recover monetary damages. Other state and local governments have filed similar lawsuits. </p><p>   The defendants fighting such claims include BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. </p><p>   They sought to move Baltimore's case to federal court, which they argued is a more appropriate venue with fairer procedural protections. The companies said the case belonged in the federal system because some of their oil-and-gas exploration efforts have come at the behest of the federal government. </p><p>   A federal trial judge denied the request in 2019 and last year a federal appeals court said it was largely powerless to consider moving the case out of the state system. </p><p>   The high court, in a 7-1 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, on Monday said that decision was incorrect. </p><p>   In a highly technical ruling, the Supreme Court sent the case back to a federal appeals court for further proceedings. The justices said nothing about the substance of the case. </p><p>   Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Justice Samuel Alito didn't participate in the case. </p><p></p>",
