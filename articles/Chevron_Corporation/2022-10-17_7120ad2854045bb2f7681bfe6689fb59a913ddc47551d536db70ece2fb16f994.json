  "text": "<p>For someone who has taken home $80mn in total compensation the past four years, I would have expected more compelling arguments from Chevron's chief executive Mike Wirth (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83d93bdd-659a-47b3-96bf-40884ef46a09\">Interview</a>, October 14). Perhaps the lack of accountability to an independent chair has softened his critical thinking skills. Instead, he managed only to put forth straw man arguments, delivered with a pitch-perfect “get off my lawn” air of grievance.</p> <p>Energy markets are not any more volatile today than in years past, with or without the increased emphasis on climate policy. Looking at weekly Brent prices back to 1990, the standard deviation in year-on-year prices from 1991-2012 was 0.37. In the decade since, it has been 0.38 (excluding a 10-week period for Covid).</p> <p>Wirth argues that the energy “crunch” predates the war in Ukraine, due to under-investment in supply. A “crunch” would suggest there is not enough supply to meet demand. If that were true, Opec would have no need for a 2mn barrels a day decrease in its production quota.</p> <p>Regardless, reduced capex in the industry has been exclusively due to market forces. First, the wild excess of the shale boom massively oversupplied the market. Wall Street crushed exploration and production companies for their profligate ways, and E&amp;Ps responded by reining in capex and becoming more conservative with their cash (read: returning it to shareholders).</p> <p>Second, investors are loath to let carbon-based chieftains overinvest in capacity when the world is poised to need far less of their product in the decades to come.</p> <p>So yes, the Biden administration sees the need to reduce carbon emissions. But let's not pretend coal plants have shuttered because of any government policies. Those that have closed were too expensive to operate relative to natural gas or renewables. For all the emphasis on climate change, there has been no carbon tax to capture the emissions' externality.</p> <p>Wirth is right on one key point, though. The blame for fossil fuel use lies as much with consumers as with suppliers.</p> <p>Thankfully, more and more drivers are choosing to drive electric; a development no amount of finger wagging from Big Oil executives is likely to reverse.</p> <p><strong>Eric Crawford</strong><br><em>Former Equity Research Analyst<br>UBS Investment Bank, Carmel, IN, US</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Big Oil presents straw man arguments for the energy crunch' FT.com 17 October.
