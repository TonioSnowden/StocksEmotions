  "title": "BP Buys Renewable Natural-Gas Company in $4.1 Billion Deal; British oil major says purchase of Archaea Energy will help meet rising demand for biofuels",
  "text": "<p>BP agreed to pay $26 a share for Archaea, a 38% premium to the U.S. company's 30-day weighted share price. BP also will take on $800 million of Archaea's debt, taking the total value of the deal to $4.1 billion.</p><p>BP executives said Archaea and BP would be able to tap into rising demand for renewable natural gas. They also said investors would benefit from the oil major's global trading operation and deep pockets, as well as U.S. government tax credits for renewable-energy investment.</p><p>Biogas can be captured from decomposing landfill and farm waste and made into alternative fuel for heavy trucks, power plants and other uses. The decomposition process releases methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. The goal is to reduce emissions by processing the biogas into usable, transportable gas that can replace conventional natural gas and diesel fuel for vehicles.</p><p>Earlier this year Chevron Corp. made one of its largest investments in renewable fuels, paying $3.15 billion for Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group.</p><p>BP said it expects the Archaea deal to double its biogas-related earnings before taxes and other factors to $2 billion a year by 2030.</p><p>\"It's a business we know well. We have loads and loads of customers,\" many of them willing to pay a premium for greener fuels to meet their own low-carbon targets, BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said Monday. He said examples include logistics giant DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG, and e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>BP is aiming to increase its biogas production to 70,000 barrels of oil-equivalent a day by 2030, from 10,000 equivalent barrels a day now, through the Archaea deal and other BP operations including the U.K. and Germany. Archaea produces the equivalent of 6,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day of renewable natural gas. It will operate as a subsidiary of BP, the companies said.</p><p>Asked whether BP will need to do more acquisitions to achieve its biogas target, Mr. Looney said, \"It doesn't need to. It will all depend on valuation.\" The company is also pushing further into green hydrogen and offshore wind, though its renewables business is still dwarfed by profits from oil and gas production.</p><p>Archaea was formed last year through a deal that combined then-three-year-old Archaea Energy LLC with another energy company through a publicly traded acquisition vehicle. The company operates 50 biogas facilities across the U.S. and has a pipeline to develop dozens more.</p><p>However, the size of the deal could pose a risk to share buybacks that investors have been counting on, by reducing BP's cash position, Jefferies analysts said Monday. BP said the deal doesn't change its dividend and buyback plans.</p><p>Mr. Looney, when asked in a webcast with analysts after the deal was announced why BP chose to do a big renewables deal while oil and gas prices are so high, said, \"I'm not sure anyone's ever made money buying a hydrocarbon business at $100 oil.\"</p><p>The acquisition is BP's largest since Mr. Looney took over as CEO in 2020 and since 2018, when BP acquiredBHP Billiton Ltd.'s U.S. shale assets for more than $10 billion, BP said.</p><p>Shares of BP closed down about 1% in London trading, erasing earlier gains.</p><p>Chris Wack contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>BP Buys Renewable Natural-Gas Company in $4.1 Billion Deal</p>",
