  "title": "U.S. Stocks Close Sharply Higher as Investors Digest Powell Comments; All three major indexes ahead more than 2% after being down earlier in the session",
  "text": "<p>Stocks were initially little changed after the Fed announced it would raise interest rates by half a percentage point and begin to shrink its $9 trillion asset portfolio next month. Investors had widely expected both decisions heading into the conclusion of the central bank's policy meeting.</p><p>What caught some by surprise was Mr. Powell putting to rest the idea that the Fed may raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point at a future Fed meeting this year. Federal-funds futures, which traders use to track changes in interest-rate expectations, had previously shown the market pricing in an 95% chance of the Fed making such a move in June.</p><p>\"There's a sense of relief,\" said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute.</p><p>With stocks and bonds on shaky footing as of late, many investors had been worried that the pace at which the Fed tightens monetary policy would trip up markets. Others have been grappling with fears that the central bank, which is raising rates swiftly to try to tamp down inflation, may inadvertently tip the economy into recession.</p><p>The Fed's messaging, however, helped put investor anxiety at ease, according to Mr. Smart.</p><p>\"There's a feeling they're heading into the right direction,\" he said.</p><p>Stocks rose across the board, with energy shares leading the gains. All 11 of the S&amp;P 500's sectors were recently in the green, all up by at least 1%.</p><p>Exxon Mobil and Chevron rose more than 3% apiece, boosted by rising oil prices.</p><p>Meanwhile, technology and consumer-discretionary shares, which had been among the market's biggest decliners earlier Wednesday, flew higher. The group had taken a hit earlier as investors facing higher interest rates shied away from companies with higher valuations. But it then staged a rebound, alongside bond prices, after Mr. Powell's comments.</p><p>Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose more than 4% each.</p><p>Corporate earnings also spurred volatility in the market Wednesday.</p><p>Airbnb shares rose 7.7% after the company said it expects to post its first full-year net profit this year. Starbucks added 9.8% after the coffee chain said profits and sales grew in the most recent quarter.</p><p>As stocks climbed, Treasury prices rose, too, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 2.914%, compared with 2.957% Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The bond market had been hit by its worst rout in decades as investors have grappled with accelerating inflation and the prospect of rapid interest-rate increases by the Fed. That had added to the turmoil across the stock market this year.</p><p>Yet Mr. Powell's comments appeared to ease the selling pressure on Treasurys Wednesday.</p><p>Other officials expressed confidence in the economic picture. The U.S. economy remains strong despite the fact that it shrank in the first quarter of this year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in London.</p><p>In commodities markets, oil prices rose after the European Union proposed banning imports of Russian crude within six months and banning imports of refined oil products from Russia by the end of the year. U.S. crude oil rose 5.3% to $107.81 a barrel, posting its biggest one-day gain since mid-April.</p><p>Overseas, stocks were mostly lower. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 1.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1%, and South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.1%. Markets in mainland China and Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Close Sharply Higher as Investors Digest Powell Comments</p>",
