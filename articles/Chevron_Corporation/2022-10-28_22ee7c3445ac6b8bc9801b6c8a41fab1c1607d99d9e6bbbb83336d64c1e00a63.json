  "text": "<p>Amazon's downbeat outlook for its current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping period, was the latest in a series of weak results from formerly highflying tech titans. Though Amazon is technically categorized as a consumer discretionary company in the S&amp;P 500, many investors and traders have long considered it in the same grouping as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, all of which released disappointing quarterly results this week, unleashing sharp stock selloffs.</p><p>Amazon's shares slid 11% Friday. Meta's shares stabilized after losing nearly 25% on Thursday.</p><p>\"Since the financial crisis, you've had this massive rally in tech stocks on the combination of cheap energy, very low interest rates and a massive acceleration in the adoption of digital services,\" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. \"Now on the backside of this pandemic, with interest rates and inflation suddenly out of the bottle, you've seen a drastic repricing of tech stocks. A lot of investors are beginning to question their portfolios.\"</p><p>Investors worry that a much-feared U.S. economic slowdown is beginning to take root as consumers and businesses pull back amid stubbornly high inflation and tighter central-bank policy.</p><p>\"My gut feeling is that tech companies are leading where other companies will follow in the coming months,\" said Dan Boardman-Weston, chief executive officer of BRI Wealth Management.</p><p>Not all third-quarter earnings have been bad. Apple reported record revenue in its latest quarter, while oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron on Friday posted some of their highest-ever quarterly profits. Results from some U.S. banks and industrial bellwether Caterpillar have also been surprisingly resilient.</p><p>Recent figures on the strength of the U.S. economy have been mixed. Data Friday showed a stronger-than-expected monthly rise in consumer spending in September. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal-consumption expenditures index, edged slightly lower last month from August.</p><p>A separate report showed worker pay and benefits rose 5% in the third quarter from a year before. The gain marked a slight cooling from the prior quarter.</p><p>A day earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew in the third quarter, though consumer and business spending faltered.</p><p>U.S. bond yields have eased in recent days as investors reassess their expectations for more rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The central bank is meeting next week and is expected to deliver another 0.75 percentage-point increase, but some investors expect the Fed will ease up on the pace of rate increases thereafter.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury hovered around 4% Friday, up from 3.938% on Thursday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.2% to $93.88.</p><p>Overseas, European stocks fell. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 shed 0.4% while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 declined 0.4%. Asian stocks also declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 3.7%, wrapping up its worst week since 2018. Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 0.9% and China's benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 2.2%.</p><p>Write to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Open Higher as Investors Weigh Tech Earnings</p>",
