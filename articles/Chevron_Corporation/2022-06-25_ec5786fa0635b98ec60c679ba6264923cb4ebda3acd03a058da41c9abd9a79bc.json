  "text": "<p>The union push of the past few years has reached the doors of the Apple store. Employees at an Apple location outside Baltimore voted Saturday to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, a move that creates the first union of Apple retail employees in the U.S. Robert Martinez Jr., IAM international president, said the victory \"shows the growing demand for unions at Apple stores and different industries across our nation.\" An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple shares rose 3.3% Tuesday, on the first day of trading after the vote.</p><p>KELLOGG CO.</p><p>K +2%</p><p>Snack-food giant Kellogg announced Tuesday it plans to split into three companies. One would house its growing snack business with brands such as Pringles, Cheez-Its and Pop-Tarts, which collectively accounted for 80% of Kellogg's sales last year. Another would be home to cereal-aisle staples including Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. The third would consist of its plant-based-foods, primarily its MorningStar Farms brand. \"Bigness for bigness sake doesn't make a lot of strategic sense,\" said Chief Executive Steve Cahillane, who will head the $11.4 billion snack business. Kellogg shares rose 2% Tuesday.</p><p>EXXON MOBIL CORP.</p><p>XOM -3%</p><p>With U.S. gas prices hovering near $5 a gallon, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm pressed executives at Exxon, Chevron Corp. and other major oil companies and refiners Thursday for their solutions on how to boost fuel supplies. The group discussed ideas including accelerating permits for offshore energy production and suspending the production of more expensive premium fuels. Shares of Exxon fell 3% Thursday.</p><p>ALTRIA GROUP INC.</p><p>MO -9.2%</p><p>The Biden administration plans to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a move that would upend the $95 billion U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions to quit smoking. The plan, unveiled late Tuesday, likely wouldn't take effect for years, and tobacco companies could try to block it in court. On Wednesday, the Journal reported regulators were preparing to order Juul Labs Inc. to take its e-cigarettes off the U.S. market, a move they formalized Thursday. Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, also owns a 35% stake in Juul. Its shares fell 9.2% Wednesday.</p><p>NETFLIX INC.</p><p>NFLX +1.6%</p><p>A streaming giant is getting a little bit smaller. Netflix is laying off about 300 employees, a move that follows a previous round of layoffs in May that affected 150 workers. The new cuts represent about 3% of its workforce and come as Netflix is reining in spending on content and looking to drum up new revenue with the planned launch of an ad-supported tier. Netflix in April reported its first quarterly loss of subscribers in more than a decade and said it expected to lose two million subscribers in the current quarter. Netflix shares rose 1.6% Thursday but are down almost 70% since the start of the year.</p><p>MCDONALD'S CORP.</p><p>MCD +0.2%</p><p>The world's largest fast-food chain is planning a dramatic overhaul. McDonald's executives this week notified its franchisees -- who collectively run 95% of the company's U.S. restaurants -- that they will have to go through a more stringent review every 20 years to keep their restaurants, according to an email viewed by the Journal. McDonald's will consider new factors, like performance history, as it asks owners to apply to keep their locations. And it will now consider factors such as customer complaints to determine which franchisees can add new restaurants. McDonald's shares rose 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>ZENDESK INC.</p><p>ZEN +28%</p><p>Software company Zendesk agreed to be acquired by a group of buyout firms for $10.2 billion. The deal, with a group led by Hellman &amp; Friedman LLC and Permira, values the firm at $77.50 a share, Zendesk said Friday. While that is a roughly 34% premium to Thursday's closing price, it is down sharply from a roughly $17 billion bid the company rejected in February. Later that month, Zendesk shareholders rejected a proposed $4.1 billion deal to acquire the parent of web-survey company SurveyMonkey. Zendesk shares jumped 28% Friday to close at $74.17.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
