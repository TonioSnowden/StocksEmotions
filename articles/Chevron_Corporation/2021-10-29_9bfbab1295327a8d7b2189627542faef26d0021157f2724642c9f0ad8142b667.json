  "text": "<p>All three major indexes started Friday lower, but the buoyancy that has lifted them each by at least 17% this year resurfaced by midday. All three were recently positive. The S&amp;P 500 recently gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 70 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite edged up less than 0.1%, erasing steeper losses from the morning.</p><p>All three indexes are still on track for big monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.8% for the month, on pace for its largest monthly increase since November of last year.</p><p>Apple shares recently fell 2.4%, and Amazon.com shares retreated 2.9%. Together, both companies account for nearly 10% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization.</p><p>\"I think investors are taking [Apple and Amazon's earnings results] in stride because they've seen broader strength across the market\" during earnings season, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.</p><p>Overall, strong earnings have supported stocks' recent rally. On Friday, the two largest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, reported their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the pandemic. Shares gained 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively. Starbucks shares slid 7.2% after the coffee chain said its U.S. sales were strong, but the pandemic's resurgence in China had dragged on revenue.</p><p>Fresh data Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending grew more slowly in September, as the Covid-19 Delta variant and supply-chain disruptions weighed on households.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1%. Shares of Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, rose more than 20% from its initial public offering price when it started trading Friday in Stockholm.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.567% from 1.568% Thursday. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>Investors sold off eurozone government bonds after fresh data showed that inflation in the eurozone accelerated in October at the fastest pace since July 2008.</p><p>This came after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Thursday that investors were wrong to expect the ECB to increase interest rates next year in response to rising inflation. The selloff in bond markets this week suggests investors doubt the central bank's ability to hold that line.</p><p>\"The market was betting on the full credibility of the ECB, and is now having doubts,\" said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>In Asia, stock indexes closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.8%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up almost 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise, Shrugging Off Disappointing Earnings From Apple, Amazon</p>",
