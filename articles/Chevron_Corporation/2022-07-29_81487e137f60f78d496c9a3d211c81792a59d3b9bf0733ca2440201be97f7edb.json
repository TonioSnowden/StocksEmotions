  "title": "Chevron Posts Record $11.6 Billion Quarterly Profit; The U.S. oil company's second-quarter earnings were lifted by rebounding oil and natural-gas demand and record gasoline prices",
  "text": "<p>Share Your Thoughts</p><p>What is your outlook on oil prices for the rest of the year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon Mobil Corp., is the latest in the industry to report a banner quarter as it benefits from renewed demand for oil and gas after pandemic quarantine measures lifted. Shell PLC posted a second consecutive record quarterly profit Thursday, hitting $16.7 billion in profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis, a figure similar to net income that U.S. oil companies report, and Exxon is expected to report record profits later Friday morning.</p><p>Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth touted the company's investments in oil-and-gas production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and in renewable fuels, saying it had doubled spending compared with last year and was one of the nation's leading renewable-fuel makers. \"Chevron is increasing energy supplies to help meet the challenges facing global markets,\" Mr. Wirth said in a written statement.</p><p>Despite the record profit, Chevron signaled it will stick with relatively conservative spending plans in the oil patch and focus on returning more cash to investors and bolstering its balance sheet. Chevron has increased spending since 2020, but its budget remains below prepandemic levels.</p><p>Chevron said Friday it lifted the upper end of its share-repurchase program this year to as much as $15 billion, up from an earlier maximum of $10 billion, and that it had paid off some of its debt, helping to firm up its balance sheet as fears of slowing economic activity mount. Chevron's debt ratio declined to 14.6%, down from 18.4% at the end of last year.</p><p>Chevron's oil-and-gas production declined globally about 7.4% compared with the same period a year ago to 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, though it rose in the U.S. by about 3.2%. Its output internationally dropped about 13.4%, largely due to the end of projects in Thailand and Indonesia. Mr. Wirth said the company's output in the Permian was 15% higher than a year ago.</p><p>The company's record profit was buoyed by big earnings increases in its oil-and-gas production business, which brought in $8.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion the same period last year, and its refined-products business, which shot up more than 300% to $3.5 billion. All told, its sales and other revenue came to $65 billion, up from $36 billion in the same time last year.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Chevron Posts Record $11.6 Billion Quarterly Profit</p>",
