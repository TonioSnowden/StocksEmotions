  "title": "Students in a 'Hostile Environment'; A public school teacher challenges critical race theory.",
  "text": "<p>Missing from our curriculum during the 2020/ 21 school year was the diversity, perspective, truth, and rigor that previously were taught. Previously vetted books were removed from our classroom and sent to recycling. Gone was the diverse collection of American and World Literature: House On Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros, [James Baldwin's] Go Tell It On The Mountain, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, essays by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , poetry by Maya Angelou, Robert Frost, Anne Frank, Night, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas, Macbeth, Walt Whitman, The Salem Witch Trials, The Crucible, Holocaust studies... world art, universal themes, universal characters...</p><p>What saddened me most was that I would not be teaching the Holocaust any longer. The Holocaust unit included one of the following: either Anne Frank, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas, and depending on reading level, Elie Weisel's Night. When I asked the school reading coach where all the Holocaust books were, she said \"we do not teach the Holocaust because kids can't relate to the story.\"</p><p>... Then sometime around January 2021, hundreds of new leaflet style booklets arrived, all poorly written, historically biased, inaccurate, and pushing a racial narrative...</p><p>Perplexed, I thought there was a mistake. I asked a teacher leader what was going on and he looked jokingly at me saying \"Comrade, we were told to remove all classroom sets of reading material in order to make room for the incoming sets of books.\" I laughed, assuming this was a joke. But it was not a joke, this was real and happening in my school, in my classroom.</p><p>After Ms. Bessinger published her report, she was gratified to receive \"a great deal of support from educators and parents all over the world.\" This week she writes again for Legal Insurrection and explains what happened next:</p><p>The first sign of retaliation was evident even before school restarted... I was pulled from teaching one of my English classes and assigned to teach using CNN news sources, as well as Time for Kids...</p><p>Everything in school now is about race. During orientation, teacher professional development included a \"privilege walk,\" in which teachers were requested to talk about our personal bias, to share our personal trauma, and to connect with children on their personal trauma. Much of the bias focus was on race. I declined to participate in the voluntary privilege walk, but observed it. We also were told to be surrogate parents to our students, given lesson plans on Malcolm X, and that discussions around justifiable violence towards white people should be taught to children of color.</p><p>On the first day of school during professional development orientation... there was a verbal attack on me in front of other staff by one of my colleagues who shouted at me that I had white privilege. This colleague went on to say that she would teach her students Malcom X's message to use violence as payback for crimes against slaves. I asked her who the recipient of this Malcolm X style attack would be, and she said everyone who harmed slaves. Since all those people are now dead, clearly the intent was to intimidate me openly at work and to send a message.</p><p>Ms. Bessinger concludes:</p><p>As I watch education transform from a student centered career to a highly racialized, politicized battle ground, I am profoundly sad for all students who are caught in the middle of this hostile environment.</p><p>***</p><p>Princeton Beats MIT</p><p>Higher education has been no less hostile for those who refuse to embrace leftist ideology, but Princeton professor Robert George is leading a campaign to cancel unjust cancellations occurring on American campuses. Mr. George tweeted on Sunday about the latest outrage, this time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:</p><p>Dorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. He was to give MIT's prestigious Carlson Lecture on Oct. 21.... Shamefully, MIT canceled the lecture under pressure from activists who objected to his political views.</p><p>Those who pressured MIT to cancel Dr. Abbot's lecture oppose his views on \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\"... these have nothing to do with the topic of his Carlson Lecture. The activists cancel anyone who dissents from their dogmas.</p><p>Fortunately Mr. George was then able to tweet two encouraging updates this week:</p><p>I'm pleased to announce that Dorian Abbot's lecture on extrasolar planets, meant to be the 2021 Carlson Lecture at MIT (until MIT disgraced itself by yielding to pressure to cancel it), will be given at Princeton on the date it was to be given at MIT: Oct. 21. Details to follow...</p><p>The lecture that MIT invited Dorian Abbot to give and then canceled, which Dr. Abbot is now giving at Princeton by Zoom on Oct. 21st, already has a subscription that has reached our Zoom limit. We've requested an expansion of the limit to accommodate more people. We're delighted.</p><p>What would be truly delightful is for MIT to reverse its disgraceful decision to cancel. Prof. George's Princeton colleague Keith Whittington writes in a letter on behalf of the Academic Freedom Alliance that \"this disinvitation represents an egregious violation of the principles of academic freedom and an abnegation of MIT's own stated commitment to freedom of thought.\" Professor Whittington adds:</p><p>MIT's own Policies and Procedures 4.1 avows a broad freedom of faculty to engage \"in the expression of their ideas in the academic community.\" Policies and Principles 14.2 commits the university to \"a policy of open research and free interchange of information among scholars.\" Policies and Principles 9.0 recognizes that \"the free and open exchange of ideas and viewpoints reflected in the concept of academic freedom may sometimes prove disturbing or offensive to some,\" but that \"the examination and challenging of assumptions, beliefs or opinions is, however, intrinsic to the rigorous education that MIT strives to provide.\" Adherence to such principles is deeply inconsistent with disinviting scholars from presenting on their academic work simply because their opinions are controversial or disfavored by members of the campus community. The fact that some might regard Professor Abbot's ideas disturbing or offensive provides no justification for suppressing his speech and denying other members of the community the opportunity to engage in the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>Now Professor Abbot tells his storyvia a Substack post in which he writes:</p><p>I view this episode as an example as well as a striking illustration of the threat woke ideology poses to our culture, our institutions and to our freedoms. I have consistently maintained that woke ideology is essentially totalitarian in nature: it attempts to corral the entirety of human existence into one narrow ideological viewpoint and to silence anyone who disagrees. I believe that these features ultimately derive from the ideology's abandonment of the principle of the inherent dignity of each human being. It is only possible to instrumentalize the individual in order to engineer group-based outcomes within a philosophical framework that has rejected this principle. Similarly, it is easy to justify silencing a dissenter if your ideology denies her individual dignity. Clearly, wokeism has not reached a terrible nadir of destruction yet, but the lesson of history is that we need to name and confront totalitarianisms before they cause disaster, while it is still possible to do so.</p><p>While it is still possible to save its reputation for academic integrity, MIT should reinvite Mr. Abbot to speak.</p><p>***</p><p>News Diversity</p><p>Given the oppressive groupthink that has come to dominate so many large American institutions, your humble correspondent is feeling especially pleased these days to serve as a contributor to an institution created to challenge conventional media outlets. Twenty-five years ago Paul Farhi of the Washington Post reported:</p><p>Surely, there's already more TV news than anyone can use. Local news at 5, 6, and 11. National news at 7. \"Magazine\" shows in the morning and in prime time. And CNN all the rest of the time.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch has some news for you: There is, he thinks, room for still more.</p><p>After years of trying to pull together an American news operation to complement his entertainment empire, Murdoch finally is about to arrive as a TV news baron. Without much flash or fanfare, his Fox News Channel will make its debut Monday in cable TV households across the country... The 24-hour news and talk channel could be one of the biggest long shots Murdoch has played in a career filled with gambles. Fox News will debut at a time when network news audiences are shrinking, due largely to ferocious competition.</p><p>But until Fox there was no formidable competition to the leftist tilt expressed in most television news. Well-credentialed liberals at coastal institutions decided what was news and instructed viewers what to think about it. \"The most important thing for me is that FOX gave a voice to the voiceless â€“ before FOX the news was about what the elites were thinking,\" says Fox Business host Charles Payne via email. In the years since, it's been tough to tell whether the media establishment has been more resentful of Fox's challenge to its cultural authority or its revenues.</p><p>Right from the start the new cable competitor inspired detractors, but readers may be surprised at some of the initial brickbats. After the 1996 Fox debut Ellis Simon wrote in Electronic Media:</p><p>The channel launched last Monday in 17 million homes to largely lackluster reviews from TV critics.</p><p>USA Today said the channel's rigid daytime format of 10-minute news digests followed by 20 minutes of features \"encouraged a bland sameness.\"</p><p>Twenty-five years later, bland it is not.</p><p>***</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Simply Justice, Not 'Social Justice'</p><p>Debra Cassens Weiss reports in the ABA Journal:</p><p>Disbarred environmental lawyer Steven Donziger was sentenced to six months in prison Friday for refusing to surrender his electronic devices and disobeying other court orders in a suit against him by the Chevron Corp.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska of the Southern District of New York said Donziger willfully disobeyed court orders in the Chevron Corp.'s civil RICO suit, which contends that Donziger obtained a $9.5 billion pollution judgment against the oil company in Ecuador through fraud.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.
