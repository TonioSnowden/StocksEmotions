  "title": "World News:  Freed Executive Describes Prison Ordeal  ---  Held for 5 years in  Venezuela, he lost 100  pounds, survived Covid  and a heart attack  ----  By Ryan Dube and Kejal Vyas",
  "text": "<p>   For nearly five years, Houston oil executive Jose Pereira was jailed in Venezuela, spending long stretches in isolation in an underground cell, deprived of medication and surviving on chicken scraps and rice. </p><p>   In an interview, Mr. Pereira said he had lost 100 pounds and survived two bouts of Covid-19 and a heart attack by the time he was freed earlier this month, after high-level talks between the Biden administration and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's authoritarian regime. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira's experience provided a rare window into the treatment of foreign prisoners accused of white-collar or political crimes in Venezuela, who the U.S. has said are tried in kangaroo courts and used as bargaining chips in negotiations with Washington. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira, a U.S. permanent resident, was freed along with six U.S. citizens in a prisoner swap as part of talks that could lead to the easing of U.S. sanctions to permit Chevron Corp. to restart pumping oil in Venezuela, if Mr. Maduro agrees to negotiate with the political opposition. In exchange for the detained Americans, the U.S. returned two nephews of Mr. Maduro's wife who were convicted in the U.S. of drug trafficking. </p><p>   \"I don't know how I'm alive,\" Mr. Pereira, 60 years old, said from his home in Houston, where he was reunited with his wife and children. \"I never thought it could happen to me. It was like living in your own movie.\" </p><p>   U.S. officials said several other Americans remain detained in Venezuela, including two former Green Berets accused of participating in a raid to topple the Maduro regime in 2020. Foro Penal, a nonprofit group that represents people jailed in Venezuela, says there are 240 political prisoners in the country, many of them Venezuelan political figures and former military officers accused of conspiring against the government. </p><p>   A United Nations committee last month said in a report that it found ample evidence that the Venezuelan government committed grave crimes against humanity to crush political dissent, detailing how, the U.N. panel said, Mr. Maduro and his top aides have been personally involved in ordering the arrests and torture of their adversaries. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira said he wasn't beaten. But he said he did face psychological hardship, including having the lights of his cell kept on 24 hours a day. At the beginning of his detention, he recalled being allowed to go outside only once every three months. </p><p>   Venezuela's government didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   The release of the Americans has stoked debate among U.S. officials and lawmakers over how the country should engage with countries arbitrarily holding U.S. citizens. Among the most prominent Americans held in foreign detention is women's basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been jailed in Russia since just before its invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira said his jailing was so hard on his family that it didn't matter to him how the U.S. secured his freedom. Mr. Pereira said his daughter had to receive treatment for depression and the family faced financial hardship. </p><p>   \"The suffering of our family was so bad, I didn't care what was the tool to release us,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira's nightmare began when he got a call summoning him to Caracas on Thanksgiving Day in 2017. He said he thought it would be a quick, routine business trip when he and five fellow executives from Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp., a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, traveled to Venezuela for a budget meeting. </p><p>   But soon after, military intelligence officers arrested the group and sent them to jail on corruption charges. President Maduro on state television called the men \"thieving traitors.\" </p><p>   The men were convicted by a Venezuelan judge in 2021 of embezzlement and money laundering tied to a proposed $4 billion financing deal that was never executed. Mr. Pereira, who was the president of Citgo, was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison. He lost his job during the ordeal. </p><p>   They were detained before the U.S. imposed widespread sanctions on Venezuela. After the sanctions, the U.S. transferred the management of Citgo, which refines oil for domestic use in the U.S., to Venezuelan opposition figures. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira, and the U.S., said the charges were a sham. He also said it quickly became clear that Venezuela's government planned to use the jailed men as bargaining chips with Washington. </p><p>   \"We were not political, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said. </p><p>   During the first 10 months, Mr. Pereira slept on the floor in an underground cell that prisoners called the \"submarine,\" because it had no windows or fresh air. The Citgo executives had virtually no communication with their families or a lawyer, he said. When there was food, guards often gave them a chicken neck or canned ham. </p><p>   \"We were in the darkest moment. We didn't know what time it was. It could be day or night,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Pereira found relief in a small, pocket-size Bible that a fellow inmate had smuggled in. One day, Mr. Pereira said, a guard saw them reading the Bible. The guard brought them a normal-size Bible and asked them to pray for him, Mr. Pereira said. </p><p>   \"It was kind of magical,\" Mr. Pereira said. \"I was not a very Catholic guy, but now I am. You learn that God is there, it gives you a lot of hope.\" </p><p>   In late 2019, the Citgo employees were granted house arrest in Caracas. But two months later, they were returned to prison. Later, the employees were transferred to the Helicoide, a 1950s-era Caracas shopping mall now used as a detention center. </p><p>   After returning home to Texas, Mr. Pereira said, he attended church with his wife. He devoured a big burger and a heap of onion rings at the Hard Rock Cafe. </p><p>   Now, he is getting to know his 3-year-old grandson. He is also looking to organize a vacation that he and his wife had hoped to take for his 60th birthday, which was in August when he was jailed. </p><p>   \"Now I'm trying to recover the time lost,\" Mr. Pereira said. </p><p></p>",
