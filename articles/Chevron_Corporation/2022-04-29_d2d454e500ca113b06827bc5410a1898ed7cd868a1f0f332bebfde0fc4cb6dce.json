  "title": "Oil Giants Buoyed by High Oil Prices Shower Investors With Cash; Exxon said it would raise its share repurchase program to $30 billion through 2023, and France's Total said it could double its buybacks",
  "text": "<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, on Friday said it made $6.3 billion in quarterly profit, up from about $1.4 billion in the same period last year. The company has paid out billions of dollars to investors so far this year.</p><p>France's TotalEnergies reported $4.9 billion in profit on Thursday, and said it could double its share buybacks this quarter. Other European energy giants, Shell PLC and BP PLC, will post first-quarter results next week and are also expected to report strong profits.</p><p>Exxon's net income was about 38% lower than analysts expected, according to FactSet. It took a $3.4 billion accounting charge after it decided to halt operations at its Sakhalin Island development in Russia's Far East. Even so, the Texas-based company is planning to boost its $10-billion share-buyback program to $30 billion through 2023, a sign of confidence in its underlying financial health as energy demand rises, Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Oil Giants Buoyed by High Oil Prices Shower Investors With Cash</p>",
