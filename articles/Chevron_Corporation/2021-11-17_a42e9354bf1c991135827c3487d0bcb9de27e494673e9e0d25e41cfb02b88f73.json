  "title": "Biden Asks FTC to Examine Oil, Gas Companies' Role in High Gasoline Prices; President cites 'mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior' by oil-and-gas companies",
  "text": "<p>\"This unexplained large gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price at the pump is well above the pre-pandemic average,\" Mr. Biden wrote. \"Meanwhile, the largest oil-and-gas companies in America are generating significant profits off higher energy prices.\"</p><p>The president called on Ms. Khan to \"consider whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump,\" asking her to \"bring all of the Commission's tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing.\"</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's top lobbying group, called the letter a \"distraction from the fundamental market shift that is taking place,\" adding that demand has increased as the economy picks back up.</p><p>\"Rather than launching investigations on markets that are regulated and closely monitored on a daily basis or pleading with OPEC to increase supply, we should be encouraging the safe and responsible development of American-made oil and natural gas,\" Frank Macchiarola, the group's senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives for Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and BP PLC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. A Royal Dutch Shell PLC spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his senior advisers have for weeks been weighing policy options in response to high gas prices, amid mounting concerns about inflation.</p><p>U.S. inflation hit a three-decade high in October. Gasoline prices were up more than 60% in mid-November from a year earlier, putting the price for a gallon of regular gas at the highest level since 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Mr. Biden has limited options for quickly lowering prices.</p><p>The U.S. president has called on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production to ease shortages and lower prices. OPEC has so far rebuffed those requests.</p><p>Some of Mr. Biden's senior advisers have urged him to release oil from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but the administration hasn't done so.</p><p>Mr. Biden's letter comes after National Economic Council Director Brian Deese urged Ms. Khan in August to look into \"divergences between oil prices and the cost of gasoline at the pump.\"</p><p>In response, Ms. Khan said the commission would examine potential unlawful business practices in the oil and gas markets. She said she would take steps to deter unlawful mergers in the industry, \"identify additional legal theories\" to challenge retail fuel station mergers that allow large companies to buy family-run businesses, and investigate alleged abuses in the franchise market.</p><p>Facing political fallout from high gas prices, past presidents of both parties have called for similar investigations into alleged price gouging and manipulation in the market.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Asks FTC to Examine Oil, Gas Companies' Role in High Gasoline Prices</p>",
