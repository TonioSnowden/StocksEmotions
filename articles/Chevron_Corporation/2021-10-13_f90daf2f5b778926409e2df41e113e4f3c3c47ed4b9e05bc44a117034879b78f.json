  "text": "<p>The news highlights the clash between the Republican governor, who has accused the Biden administration of overreach for mandating vaccines, and private companies, who require greater certainty to operate safely, as the Wall Street Journal reported. Abbott has said vaccination must be voluntary, even though close to 70,000 Texans have died of COVID, and recent fatalities are almost all among unvaccinated people. The state's vaccination rate of about 50% lags the national average.</p><p>A coalition of some 900 companies grouped under the Greater Houston Partnership, including such giants as Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Chevron Corp. CVX and Accenture PLC ACN, said Tuesday that Abbott's order would complicate their efforts to run their businesses safely. The organization has been supportive of Biden's effort to require vaccines for companies with more than 100 employees.</p><p>“Employers, like most businesses, want to minimize uncertainty, and certainly this isn't helping,” Todd Logsdon, a labor-law expert at law firm Fisher Phillips, told the newspaper.</p><p>https://twitter.com/VABVOX/status/1448257878293364738The news comes as the U.S. continues to suffer almost 2,000 deaths from COVID a day, according to a New York Times tracker. And while new cases and hospitalizations are continuing to decline, tens of thousands of Americans are still getting sick every day.</p><p>Read now:&#xa0;Failing to bring COVID-19 under control will cost $5.3 trillion in lost global growth over next five years, IMF estimates</p><p>Alaska, which has been a hot spot for weeks and where hospitals have been forced to ration care, has been joined by Minnesota, which has seen new cases climb 36% in the past two weeks, the tracker is showing. ICUs are now nearing capacity, and there is a shortage of healthcare workers to tend to the sick, the Times reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says all of the state's counties are at high risk of community transmission.</p><p>The CDC's vaccine tracker shows that 187.7 million people living in the U.S. are fully vaccinated, equal to 57% of the overall population, still way below the 70% required to contain the spread, according to health experts. The number has barely budged in recent weeks, even though vaccines have proved safe and effective at preventing severe illness and death.</p><p>Some 8.55 million Americans have received a booster dose of vaccine, and the pace of booster vaccination is outpacing primary vaccination. CDC data shows that 238,059 Americans got a first vaccine dose on Tuesday, while 362,489 got a booster dose, according to an analysis by Axios.</p><p>The U.S. is planning to reopen its land borders in November to fully vaccinated travelers, ending a 19-month freeze, the Associated Press reported. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel, such as for trade, since the earliest days of the pandemic. The new rules, to be announced Wednesday, will allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to enter the U.S. regardless of the reason for travel starting in early November, when a similar easing of restrictions is set to kick in for air travel into the country.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, two mothers whose children contracted COVID in September in schools without face-mask mandates have sued their school districts, accusing them of “needlessly and recklessly endangering the health and safety” of their children, the Guardian reported. The suits accuse the school districts of creating a “snake pit” for students by failing to implement the public safety measures experts say are essential to prevent spread.</p><p>See now:&#xa0;California becomes first state to mandate vaccination for elementary- and high-school students</p><p>Elsewhere, Russia suffered yet another one-day record death toll of 984, the Moscow Times reported, cementing its position as the country in Europe with the most deaths. Russia has in the last 12 months seen the worst peacetime decline in its natural population, at just under 1 million, mostly due to COVID, the Guardian reported, citing official government statistics.</p><p>See also:&#xa0;‘Do I just suffer and hope things get better?' COVID-19 long haulers face fears of reinfection, unvaccinated Americans and medical bills.</p><p>China has started to give third vaccine shots to elderly and high-risk people in 10 regions, the Times reported. The shots are viewed as part of primary vaccination and not boosters.</p><p>Latest tallies</p><p>The global tally of the coronavirus-borne illness climbed above 238.9 million on Wednesday, while the death toll edged above 4.86 million, according to&#xa0;data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>The U.S. continues to lead the world with a total of 44.6 million cases and 717,158 deaths.&#xa0;</p><p>India is second by cases after the U.S. at 34 million and has suffered 451,189 deaths. Brazil has the second highest death toll at 601,398 and 21.6 million cases.</p><p>In Europe, Russia has recorded the most fatalities at 215,438, followed by the U.K. at 138,487.</p><p>China,&#xa0;where the virus was first discovered late in 2019,&#xa0;has had 108,809 confirmed cases and 4,809 deaths, according to its official numbers, which are widely held to be massively underreported.</p>",
