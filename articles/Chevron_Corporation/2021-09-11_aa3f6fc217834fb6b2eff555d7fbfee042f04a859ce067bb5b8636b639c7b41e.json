  "text": "<p>BIO BITS</p><p>* Age: 52</p><p>* Education: Bachelor's degree in science and master's degree in business from American University; master's degree in public administration from Harvard University; doctorate in economics from University of Oxford.</p><p>* Family: Husband Jared and 10-year-old labradoodle named Barnaby</p><p>* Worst advice you ever got? \"'Don't worry, it will all be fine' like somehow it was all going to work out, when actually there's so much in life that I think is by design, you have to be quite intentional and focused.\"</p><p>* WFH hobby: Trampolining</p><p>* First job: Summer intern at the Development Bank in Zambia.</p><p>* Favorite Book: \"The Outsiders\" by William Thorndike</p><p>* Pet Project: Brushed up on French to deliver a speech on economics for the French Treasury.</p><p>* Hobby: Training for the New York City Marathon, which will be her fifth.</p><p>* Time alarm clock goes off on weekdays? 5 a.m.</p><p>* Where did you grow up? Zambia</p><p>When Ms. Moyo has to grapple with these issues, she leans on a group of advisers that includes a fashion icon, a hedge-fund billionaire, an investment executive and a literary agent. She tries to cultivate a diversity of opinions and foster constructive feedback, which she said can be difficult to find otherwise. \"I'm a Black woman—and I think that I talk a lot about this in my own writings —but we're not entitled to feedback,\" she said. \"Whoever you are, you have to work to foster an environment for people to give you critical feedback.\"</p><p>Ms. Moyo, who has a master's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oxford, was previously an executive for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. She left Wall Street to become a full-time author and joined her first board—brewer SABMiller—that year. Her 2009 book \"Dead Aid\" attracted attention by arguing that foreign aid made the economic and political situation in Africa worse instead of relieving it. \"How Boards Work,\" her fifth and latest book, offers her view of how boards should operate in a turbulent world.</p><p>\"There has been a very strong anticapitalist movement, a very strong anti-corporate movement,\" she said. \"I was already thinking about how do we really explain why corporations are important, not just for creating jobs, not just the tax base, but also for innovation and investing in structural things like infrastructure.\"</p><p>Here are four of her most trusted advisers:</p><p>Mellody Hobson</p><p>Co-CEO of Ariel Investments, director at Starbucks Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Ms. Moyo considers Ms. Hobson the chairwoman of her personal board. The two met at a conference more than 10 years ago and were introduced by Ms. Hobson's now husband George Lucas. Now Ms. Hobson is an adviser, friend and confidante professionally and socially, ranging from philanthropic matters to health and wellness.</p><p>While the two women grew up in different places—Ms. Hobson is from Chicago—they share similar experiences. Both attended Ivy League colleges and serve on corporate boards—a rare set of experiences for Black women, Ms. Moyo said.</p><p>Ms. Moyo said Ms. Hobson taught her to be more ideological and understand that \"what is right is obvious.\" For instance, Ms. Hobson was vocal in disagreeing with a U.S. policy of separating immigrant children and parents on the border that was implemented—and then ended—by the Trump administration in 2018.</p><p>\"There's value in speaking out on some of these issues,\" Ms. Moyo said. \"In our position of privilege, if we're not going to do it then who will?\"</p><p>Dan Loeb</p><p>CEO of Third Point LLC</p><p>Ms. Moyo and Mr. Loeb, a hedge-fund manager, have known each other for roughly two decades. She said he is like a brother to her; they can speak without a filter.</p><p>Part of their close bond is a shared passion for fitness, such as their affinity for ultra-endurance athlete David Goggins. They both have pricked their fingers so they could calculate their breakdown of fat.</p><p>Mr. Loeb also has taught Ms. Moyo to focus on process rather than outcomes, she said. Ms. Moyo said she uses that lesson across her life, from company operations and even with fitness. For instance, she said, if a company has the right processes for hiring, promoting, compensating and operating, then it will function at the highest level.</p><p>\"If you're focused on the outcomes,\" she said, \"the problem is that you can end up with really bad culture.\"</p><p>Diane von Furstenberg</p><p>Fashion designer and director of the The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation</p><p>Ms. Moyo said she hopes to emulate the life of Ms. von Furstenberg, whom Ms. Hobson introduced her to roughly five years ago.</p><p>\"She's just in many ways everything I want to be,\" Ms. Moyo said. \"She's an immigrant, she came to this country, she built this business. She's in her 70s and she's still writing books. She just opened Little Island [in New York City]. She's eternally evolving.\"</p><p>A key moment in their friendship happened when the two women were wrapping up lunch at Ms. von Furstenberg's office about two years ago. As Ms. Moyo walked down the stairs she saw Ms. von Furstenberg's famed wrap dresses but then spotted the fashion designer's art gallery full of pieces by women.</p><p>\"It was just another sort of piece of how she thinks about supporting women, supporting businesses,\" Ms. Moyo said. The two had been talking about the intersection of philanthropy and business, and Ms. Moyo was struck by Ms. von Furstenberg's advice that anything is possible—and that trial and error is OK.</p><p>\"She shifted my attitude towards things,\" Ms. Moyo said. Because of that mind-set shift, Ms. Moyo said she decided to try trampolining as a form of exercise during the pandemic.</p><p>Andrew Wylie</p><p>Founder of the Wylie Agency and literary agent</p><p>When Ms. Moyo met Mr. Wylie around 12 years ago through the historian Niall Ferguson, she realized early on that he is a truth teller.</p><p>\"He does not mince words,\" she said. He soon became her book agent, and the two have worked on her latest four books together.</p><p>Ms. Moyo said Mr. Wylie taught her not to take short cuts. For instance, he'll often push back and tell her something doesn't work and will encourage her to fix pages or take a different approach to the structure.</p><p>Ms. Moyo specifically remembers when a book reviewer found a typo after publication. \"He actually made me think that that was not acceptable,\" she said. \"He could've comforted me, but he didn't. He had enough faith in me that he wanted me to step up.\"</p><p>Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com</p><p>How a Fortune 500 Director Governs Her Own Career—With Help From Diane von Furstenberg</p>",
