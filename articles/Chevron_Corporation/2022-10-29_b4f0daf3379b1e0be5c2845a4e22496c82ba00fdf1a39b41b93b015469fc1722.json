  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Exxon Profit Hits Record In Lucrative Oil Quarter",
  "text": "<p>Exxon's third-quarter earnings climbed about 10% from the previous quarter, which also set a profit record at the time. It said investments over the past five years were yielding rewards, including spending following the onset of the pandemic when many peers pulled back.</p><p>Chevron's third-quarter profit slipped about 3% to $11.2 billion from its all-time high in the second quarter due to net charges in the quarter of more than $600 million. Without those charges, it would have also hit record earnings.</p><p>Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said he doesn't expect the company next year to deviate from its spending guidance, which is well below prepandemic levels.</p><p>\"We will, on the margin, spend money where we can see an opportunity,\" Mr. Woods told analysts Friday. \"Our plans going forward are still very consistent with [previously disclosed budget] ranges.\"</p><p>After it too hit a profit record last quarter, Shell PLC said Thursday its third-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis, a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report, was $8.3 billion, down $3.2 billion from the prior quarter. The London-based oil major said it would boost its dividend and buy back an additional $4 billion of its shares in coming months.</p><p>High prices at the pump have spurred President Biden and Democrats in Congress to criticize oil companies for their historic profits and press them to put out more gasoline and diesel. Energy prices have emerged as a key campaign issue ahead of midterm elections early next month.</p><p>On Friday, in response to Exxon increasing its quarterly dividend, Mr. Biden tweeted, \"Can't believe I have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families.\"</p><p>Many oil companies are in the process of drafting capital spending budgets for next year, and few are signaling dramatic increases so far. Chevron is poised to boost capital spending 20% next year compared with 2022, well below prepandemic levels and within the five-year spending range it previously provided. The company is expected to spend around $15 billion this year. \"We have productive conversations with the [Biden] administration and share their objective of stable and affordable energy resources,\" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview. \"But at the same time, we're making decisions in the long-term interest of our shareholders.\"</p><p>Exxon's stock price closed about 3% higher Friday, while Chevron shares rose about 1%.</p><p>The Biden administration has urged oil companies to boost their refining capacity to make more gasoline and diesel, as inventories languished at the lowest levels in over a decade. Globally, refining capacity has fallen by almost 3 million barrels a day since 2020, with the U.S. down about 800,000 barrels a day.</p><p>---</p><p>Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p>",
