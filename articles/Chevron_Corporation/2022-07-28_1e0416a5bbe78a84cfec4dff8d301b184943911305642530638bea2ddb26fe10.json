  "title": "Shell Posts Record Quarterly Profit on Soaring Energy Prices; Oil major boosted by scramble for gas, refined products",
  "text": "<p>Shell's results are the latest sign of a recovery in the fortunes of the world's largest oil companies, which saw demand decimated by the outbreak of Covid in early 2020. As the pandemic took its toll, travel plummeted and weak demand led Shell and its peers to write down tens of billions of dollars in assets on expectations of sustained lower oil and gas prices.</p><p>Now, the same multinational companies are swimming in cash, as travel and manufacturing have roared back and demand for natural gas and fuel outstrips supplies. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to the energy shortage, particularly in Europe where countries are quickly trying to replace declining gas flows via pipelines from Russia.</p><p>Shell's second-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis—a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $16.7 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the year-ago period when performance was on the rebound.</p><p>Adjusted earnings, which strip out certain commodity-price adjustments and one-time charges, came in at $11.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for the quarter. Shell said it would buy back another $6 billion in shares by its third-quarter results, on top of $8.5 billion in buybacks in the first half, while also reducing its net debt.</p><p>Shares in Shell rose 1.8% in morning trading in London. Some analysts said the company's decision to keep its quarterly dividend unchanged at 25 cents a share would probably disappoint investors. Shell's chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, said Thursday that the company prefers buybacks. \"Given where our share price is at the moment, that's a very clear decision,\" she said.</p><p>Norwegian oil major Equinor ASA and TotalEnergies SE of France also have extended big returns for shareholders as their profits have soared. Shell's latest payout increase suggests the company could return $30 billion to shareholders this year, or greater than 15% of its market value, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a Thursday research note.</p><p>The record earnings and increase in shareholder returns is a far cry from April 2020 when Shell cut its dividend for the first time in 80 years. Two months later it wrote down the value of its assets by as much as $22 billion and swung to a historic loss.</p><p>Record energy prices have gone a long way to blunt the pain felt by Shell and other companies, including BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp., from their decisions to pull back from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>However, bumper profits for the major oil companies this year have also resulted in criticism from officials in Europe and the U.S. at a time when consumers are feeling the pain of higher prices when heating their homes or filling up at gas stations.</p><p>Exxon and Chevron Corp. are also expected to report another extremely profitable quarter on Friday, with BP set to announce results next week.</p><p>In May, Shell took a $3.9 billion posttax charge related to its exit from Russia holdings, primarily tied to Shell's share in a Russian natural-gas development. But even that charge was dwarfed by gains from robust oil and gas trading profit. Shell said Thursday its production of liquefied natural gas, of which it is a major global supplier, decreased by about 4% in the second quarter mainly because of the loss of volumes from the Russia development.</p><p>Shell increased overall oil and gas production by 5% in the quarter compared with the first three months of the year. Refining margins—the difference between oil and other inputs Shell makes into fuel and other products—roughly tripled in the second quarter, to $28 per barrel, the company said.</p><p>Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden on Thursday said the company is investing to fill the world's energy needs while markets \"present huge challenges for consumers, governments, and companies alike.\" Earlier this month he said Europe may need to ration energy. Analysts say self-imposed cutbacks of gas consumption and soaring prices are threatening Europe's economy, particularly as colder months approach.</p><p>Shell has already reduced by 40% or more its natural-gas input to refineries and chemical plants in the Netherlands and Germany, Mr. van Beurden said Thursday. However, he said the cuts hadn't affected output because Shell is able to repurpose gas that results from its own processes using oil, and converting that to fire furnaces. \"So in other words, it is self-help,\" he said.</p><p>The CEO said Shell is still evaluating Moscow's move on July 1 to take control of the international consortium behind the giant Sakhalin-2 oil-and-gas project in Russia's Far East, in which the company is an investor. The Kremlin's move restricts Shell's options, Mr. van Beurden said. \"It's highly unlikely that we will buy into a Russian entity,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>Shell Posts Record Quarterly Profit on Soaring Energy Prices</p>",
