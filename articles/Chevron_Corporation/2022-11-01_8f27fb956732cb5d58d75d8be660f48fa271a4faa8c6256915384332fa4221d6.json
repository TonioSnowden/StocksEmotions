  "title": "BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares; Oil major beats expectations in banner year for the world's biggest energy companies",
  "text": "<p>Flush with cash, BP said it plans to boost its oil-and-gas production both on- and offshore in the U.S. and the North Sea, with as many as seven new drilling rigs planned across those regions.</p><p>BP expects overall full-year production to be \"slightly higher\" in 2022, despite the loss of output from Russia after its decision to exit from the country. BP said it expects high oil-and-gas prices to continue, fueled in part by prolonged energy shortages in Europe.</p><p>The company didn't break out profit from natural-gas trading, but called the performance \"exceptional.\" Underlying profit from BP's gas and low-carbon business segment totaled $6.2 billion in the third quarter before interest and taxes, double the amount posted in the second quarter and more than BP's profit from the segment in the first nine months of 2021.</p><p>BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss resisted calls by analysts on a call Tuesday morning to be more specific about gas-trading profit. Mr. Auchincloss declined to confirm one analyst's estimate of $3 billion, saying \"I think transparency on trading is a tricky thing.\"</p><p>The back-and-forth reflects efforts by both investors and politicians to nail down how much major oil companies are profiting from soaring energy prices that have hit government budgets, particularly in Europe where constrained natural-gas supplies and high costs have stoked recessionary concerns.</p><p>BP's earnings come after Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, last week reported around $40 billion in collective profits in the third quarter.</p><p>The bumper haul is drawing political scrutiny from European and U.S. officials, and calls for additional taxes on the industry as Russia's war against Ukraine exacerbates high energy costs for consumers and businesses.</p><p>BP said it expects to pay around $800 million as a result of a new U.K. windfall-profits levy this year, covering seven months that the measure will be in place. That will be part of a projected $2.5 billion in overall 2022 taxes linked to its U.K. North Sea business, the company said.</p><p>On Monday, President Biden called on Congress to penalize oil-and-gas companies if they don't use their profits to help lower energy costs for consumers. But the proposal, which comes before next week's U.S. midterm elections, faces hurdles from lawmakers.</p><p>Mr. Auchincloss said Tuesday that there isn't enough detail behind a potential additional U.S. levy to say how it might affect BP. \"We're really trying to help the U.S. with energy security today and with the transition,\" Mr. Auchincloss said in an interview.</p><p>BP's ramped-up 2023 oil-and-gas production plans include two new Gulf of Mexico production facilities, one a drilling rig and the other a so-called workover rig, Mr. Auchincloss said. The latter is typically smaller than a drilling rig and used to increase productivity from existing wells.</p><p>The company previously said it is increasing spending on U.S. onshore oil and gas drilling, too. Mr. Auchincloss said Tuesday that this is expected to result in two to three new rigs next year across BP's three primary U.S. basins, which include the sprawling Texas-New Mexico Permian Basin and Haynesville Shale, a giant natural-gas field in Louisiana.</p><p>BP will debate details on U.S. shale expansion during its December budgeting process, Mr. Auchincloss said. This is in addition to North Sea expansion plans aimed at ramping up production there by 20% to 30% by 2025, helped by two new drilling rigs, he said.</p><p>For the third quarter, BP said its underlying replacement-cost profit, a metric similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report, came in at $8.2 billion. That beat the $6.1 billion average projection of 29 analysts compiled by BP and the $3.3 billion it reported a year earlier. BP's underlying third-quarter profit fell just shy of last quarter's figure, its strongest in more than a decade, boosted by high refining margins and higher oil-and-gas trading results.</p><p>The additional share buyback brings BP's announced stock purchases so far this year to $8.5 billion.</p><p>Shares in BP were roughly flat in midday trading in London.</p><p>BP's reported net result for the third quarter, which takes into account certain accounting effects related to inventory valuations amid price volatility, as well as legal costs from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and other adjustments, was a $2.2 billion loss. However, that reported result mostly reflected the accounting treatment of whipsawing natural-gas prices, and was overshadowed by the more telling $8.2 billion replacement-cost profit.</p><p>BP said it expects total capital expenditure in 2022 to be about $15.5 billion. That figure assumes the completion by year-end of its purchase of U.S. biogas producer Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion including debt, which was announced in October. BP previously forecast capital spending this year at $14 billion to $15 billion.</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares</p>",
