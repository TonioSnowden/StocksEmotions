  "text": "<p>Neither the union nor the company provided specifics about the terms under discussion.</p><p>\"CNH Industrial is disappointed that the parties were unable to reach an agreement,\" the company said in a written statement. \"We remain committed to reaching an agreement, and we are working to resolve this issue.\"</p><p>\"Our members at CNH strike for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules,\" said Chuck Browning, director of the UAW's agricultural implement department.</p><p>The strike at CNH involves about 1,100 workers at the company's plants in Racine, Wis., where its farm tractors are built, and Burlington, Iowa, where construction machinery is assembled.</p><p>The action is the latest in a series of strikes at large U.S. companies where unions have pushed for higher wages and better benefits amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and rising corporate profits.</p><p>In March, more than 500 California refinery workers went on strike at Chevron Corp. following a contract negotiation stalemate. Manufacturing workers at Kellogg Co. and Volvo last year went on strike, seeking higher pay.</p><p>CNH, brands of which include CaseIH and New Holland farm machinery and Case construction equipment, is a competitor for Deere &amp; Co., where 10,000 UAW members walked off their jobs last fall for more than a month before approving a new six-year contract.</p><p>After approving the contract in November, Deere workers received an immediate 10% raise and each worker received an $8,500 bonus. Additional 5% pay raises will be provided to Deere workers in two other years, and lump-sum bonuses amounting to 3% of workers' annual pay will be awarded in the three other years.</p><p>The auto workers union's strike against CNH is the first at the company since late 2004, the company said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
