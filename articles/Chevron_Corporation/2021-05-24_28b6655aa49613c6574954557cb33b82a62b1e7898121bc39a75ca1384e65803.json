  "text": "<p>ExxonMobil, a titan of corporate America, faces a pivotal moment this week as restive shareholders have their say on what critics call an inadequate response to seismic shifts brought on by climate change. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the most watched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f73a55b-ac59-4737-b7c8-2f575d32920b\">proxy battle</a> in years will end in a vote to decide who sits on ExxonMobil's board. The company is trying to fend off a challenge from upstart hedge fund Engine No.1, and after a string of recent endorsements the activists think victory is within grasp.</p> <p>“This will reverberate,” said Anne Simpson, head of board governance and sustainability at Calpers, a US pension fund backing the activists. “Winds of change are blowing through companies that are reluctant, fearful or unsure about how to take action [on climate].”</p> <p>The battle has been under way since December, when Engine No.1 nominated four new directors for Exxon's board and called for “purposefully repositioning the company to succeed in a decarbonising world”. </p> <p>Exxon, once notoriously aloof to shareholders, has been in listen-and-respond mode since the activist threat emerged, already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77a94c24-9002-4af0-b265-61d9656159d0\">appointing fresh directors</a> and unveiling new emissions plans. </p> <p>Darren Woods, the chief executive, told the Financial Times that he was ready to lead the board shareholders elected. </p> <p>“We will work with whatever comes out of the annual meeting,” he said. </p> <p>The vote will cap a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc409667-e048-4246-808c-9cdf8e41ac77\">contentious proxy season</a> in which Shell, Conoco, BP and other fossil fuel producers have faced investor criticism over their climate strategies. Chevron's board also faces emissions-related shareholder resolutions at its annual meeting, starting just after Exxon's on Wednesday.</p> <p>Calpers, Calstrs, and the New York state retirement fund, the US's three biggest pension funds, will all back Engine No.1's proposals, as will Legal &amp; General Investment Management and the Church Commissioners for England. </p> <p>By contrast, Norway's huge sovereign wealth fund, which has talked extensively of companies' <a href=\"https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/responsible-investment/principles/expectations-to-companies/climate-change/\">climate risk</a>, said it would withhold its vote for Woods but back the rest of the management's board slate. </p> <p>The vote will hinge on BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — the big three funds together hold more than 20 per cent of Exxon's stock — and the supermajor's huge retail investor base, accounting for almost half of its outstanding shares.</p> <p>The big three funds have not said which way they will vote but all emphasise the rising importance of climate change to their investment decisions. </p> <p>BlackRock's chief Larry Fink <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a71feaac-d3f4-4e76-a60c-c68924b06dfd\">warned</a> chief executives earlier this year that companies not preparing for the shift to cleaner fuels “will see their businesses and valuations suffer”.</p> <p>Campaigners have been glued to a fight they depict as a David and Goliath battle that will reveal Wall Street's true climate colours. </p> <p>Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, urged shareholders to “meet the moment” by backing the campaign, arguing that “massive shifts in clean technologies, government regulations and consumer preferences . . . demanded a stronger strategic response”.</p> <p>But even Wall Street equity analysts have seen the activist campaign as plausible, citing the fund's four board nominees with energy industry experience, and Engine No.1's pedigree.</p> <p>“This isn't just your average $200m hedge fund,” said Sam Margolin, managing director at Wolfe Research, referring to its backing from big pension funds. “The reputations of the people [it] nominated are very strong.” </p> <p>Earlier this month, the two biggest US proxy advisers, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e466d1ad-67b7-43e6-9c8f-b79326d28da0\">Institutional Shareholder Services</a> and Glass Lewis, respectively endorsed three and two of Engine No.1's board nominees. </p> <p>While the activists have talked of the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab010de-43c8-4b60-80f2-020f01610eee\"> “existential” risk</a> to Exxon posed by its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30ffa51b-2079-400e-84f1-2e45991194c8\">focus on oil and gas</a>, they have also tapped investor frustration with Exxon's financial performance in recent years.</p> <p>Exxon, the world's most valuable company just a decade ago, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76ecd406-b08e-4c2c-8643-cd23acb7cf2c\">booted from</a> the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, when it also lost its gold-plated AAA credit rating and endured four consecutive quarterly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/130043ba-9981-40d3-ac24-8e9a3fe0b1a7\">losses</a>. </p> <p>The company has shown rare flexibility under investor pressure this year, slashing capital spending plans, paying off some debt, and reining in the sector's most aggressive oil output growth plans. </p> <p>The implied dividend yield has almost halved since spiking above 11 per cent last year, when the market priced in a cut to one of Wall Street's most cherished payouts.</p> <p>Exxon's share price, up this year by about 40 per cent, has outperformed rivals, although some analysts attribute this to the activists' engagement.</p> <p>In response to the climate pressure, the company this year began reporting its “scope 3 emissions” from the products it sells, announced a low-carbon business line and new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b8dd517-faf6-438f-a975-a2df017127fe\">upstream emissions targets</a>, and recently floated a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9faad37b-0cb9-42cd-b0bb-591d24abb78e\">$100bn carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) concept in Texas. </p> <p>The supermajor has also appointed three new board members, including activist investor Jeffrey Ubben. On Sunday, Exxon sent a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000034088/000095010321007668/dp151549_defa14a.htm\">letter </a>to shareholders pledging to add two new board members over the next year, including one “with climate experience”, although it did not put forward any potential names for those posts.</p> <p>Woods told the FT that the board was focused on developing a strategy to “address a lower carbon future and the challenges associated with that” while also “providing the products that society needs”. </p> <p>But Exxon will not follow European supermajors in committing to net-zero emissions, targets that Ubben recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99706edb-921a-4eb1-8fa5-f07af5bed0a5\">described as “irresponsible”</a>. </p> <p>For some financial analysts, the moves Exxon has made have been too little, too late. </p> <p>Jason Gabelman, a director at Cowen, argued that Exxon still needed to do much more to “future proof their business” and its carbon plans remained too modest. </p> <p>Glass Lewis argued in its proxy recommendation that CCS, a technology critical to Exxon's plans, did not have the “scale and economic viability” to serve “as the centrepiece of an energy transition strategy”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the company's faith that an increasingly prosperous global population would always need more Exxon oil was challenged this week by the International Energy Agency, a forecaster frequently cited by the supermajor.</p> <p>The agency said no new oil and gas projects would be necessary if the world were to reduce emissions sufficiently to prevent global overheating.</p> <p>“Long-term risk continues to grow, threatening the company's existing business model”, said Glass Lewis.</p><p>Source: Justin Jacobs in Washington and Derek Brower in London 2021 'ExxonMobil faces ‘winds of change' as climate battle reaches boardroom' FT.com 24 May.
