  "title": "Commodities:  Uranium Rallies  On Instability  In Kazakhstan  ----  By Joe Wallace",
  "text": "<p>   Instability in Kazakhstan, the world's biggest uranium producer, threatens to curb output and boost prices at the same time supplies of the nuclear fuel are becoming tighter. </p><p>   Dozens of people died Thursday when authorities moved against protesters after several days of unrest and the arrival of a Russia-led military alliance to quell the disorder. </p><p>   Traders and Western mining companies say the protests might make it difficult to transport workers and equipment to mine sites when shifts rotate and could gum up exports from the country. </p><p>   Kazakhstan, a Russian ally, produces about 40% of the world's uranium output and sells it to utilities in the U.S. and other Western countries as well as China. It has established a reputation as a reliable supplier. </p><p>   Uranium prices have jumped since the protests erupted Sunday in Kazakhstan's western Mangistau region over rising energy prices, prompting the government to resign. A lightly processed form of uranium known as U3O8 was expected to change hands above $46 a pound on Thursday, traders said. That is up from $45.25 on Wednesday and $42 at the start of the year. </p><p>   The protests pushed crude-oil prices higher, too. Kazakhstan is a member of the OPEC+ alliance and produced about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day in November, according to the International Energy Agency, just under 2% of what the world consumed each day last year. </p><p>   Chevron Corp., which owns 50% of the joint venture that runs Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field, said it had cut production after protests in the facility. \"Production operations continue; however there has been a temporary adjustment to output due to logistics,\" a Chevron spokeswoman said. \"A number of contractor employees are gathered at the Tengiz field in support of protests taking place across Kazakhstan.\" </p><p>   The unrest could affect uranium deliveries if it isn't resolved quickly, traders and mining companies said. Most mining in Kazakhstan is carried out via a process called in situ leaching that requires a steady supply of pipes to line wells that are drilled in the ground as well as sulfuric acid to pump uranium to the surface. </p><p>   The instability struck at a vulnerable time for uranium markets. Prices are more than 50% higher than they were 12 months ago, according to UxC LLC. The upswing ended a long downturn sparked by the Japanese reactor meltdowns in 2011, which led Japan and Germany to close nuclear power stations, eroding demand. </p><p>   Shares of National Atomic Co. Kazatomprom JSC, the state-owned uranium mining company, fell 6.7% in London on Thursday. </p><p>   Planned deliveries to customers haven't been interrupted yet because the mining company keeps six to seven months' worth of uranium in inventory around the world, a Kazatomprom spokesman said by email. \"Of course there's going to be an impact when you have cities and towns in lockdown, limited telecommunications, and a financial system temporarily shut down,\" he added. Supplies have winnowed down in part because investors have bought the fuel in a bet governments will embrace nuclear energy to plug carbon emissions. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Benoit Faucon contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
