  "title": "Stocks, Oil Drop on Concerns Over New Covid-19 Variant; Treasury yields slide as investors shed riskier assets and pile into havens",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 was down 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2%, also on track for their worst Black Friday sessions on record. Markets were set to close early because of the holiday.</p><p>U.S. crude oil tumbled 13% to $78.15. Traders fretted that lockdowns could reduce demand for transportation fuels. Bitcoin, following the path of other risk assets, skidded 7.8% to below $55,000.</p><p>\"It's not a great day to wake up on Black Friday and see news about a concerning variant,\" said Jessica Bemer, a portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners.</p><p>Investors reached for safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled to 1.506% from 1.644% before the Thanksgiving break, its biggest drop since March 2020. Gold, another perceived store of value when riskier assets retreat, rose 0.8% to $1,797.90 a troy ounce.</p><p>The pullback created whiplash for markets that had, to a great extent, parked worries about coronavirus.</p><p>Scientists say the new coronavirus variant, dubbed B.1.1.529, has a high number of mutations that may make it more transmissible and allow it to evade some of the immune responses triggered by previous infection or vaccination. Dozens of countries have already imposed travel restrictions to and from southern Africa.</p><p>Investors feared the strain could set back months of efforts to revive the world economy and save lives.</p><p>\"For now, Covid is back on the table,\" said Takeo Kamai, head of execution services at CLSA in Tokyo.</p><p>Investors seemed to be following the playbook they pulled out early in the pandemic: sell travel stocks, buy work-from home stocks. \"This is a market that is well practiced in terms of reacting to Covid,\" Ms. Bemer said.</p><p>Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines Group dropped 10% or more, after the U.K., Israel and Singapore restricted travel from southern Africa. The European Union said it would propose stopping air travel from the region. Cruise stocks including Royal Caribbean Group were hammered, while oil producers Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 4.3% and 2.7% respectively.</p><p>Vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer rose 22% and 6.3% respectively. Netflix and DoorDash, which benefited from stay-at-home orders previously, rose 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively.</p><p>The World Health Organization is due to meet Friday to discuss whether the strain is a variant of concern. Rising caseloads of other variants have already led some European countries to tighten rules for transportation, shopping and workplaces.</p><p>Traders braced for more volatility, though some said Friday's moves were amplified by thin volumes after Thanksgiving. The Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of expected swings in the S&amp;P 500, was on track for its highest close since September. Federal-funds futures showed traders paring bets on the likelihood of an increase to interest rates by the Fed's June meeting to 64%, from 82% Wednesday.</p><p>Many U.S. investors had taken the day off, extending their Thanksgiving holiday. Ms. Bemer said she'd planned on working today, though she was staying with relatives for the holiday. \"It's a busier day than we expected,\" she said.</p><p>The combined trading volume at 12 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was about 4.8 billion shares. That was low compared with the rest of the year, but high for a Black Friday.</p><p>The average Black Friday volume since 2007 has been 2.9 billion shares, according to FactSet. The daily average for all of 2021 has been 9.4 billion shares.</p><p>Oil prices experienced some of the biggest declines. Traders said money managers were rushing to unwind wagers that a mismatch between tight supplies and rising demand would push crude prices toward $100 a barrel. The swoon might encourage the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of Russia-led allies to pause steps to pump more oil when they meet next week.</p><p>\"If the announcement is, the vaccine works on this, back up we go,\" said Adam Webb, chief investment officer of Blue Creek Capital Management. \"If the vaccines don't work against it, then good night Vienna.\"</p><p>Money managers said that even if the variant proves more resistant to vaccines than earlier strains, there were reasons to think the economic damage could be contained. MRNA vaccines, such as those manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna, can be quickly updated, and businesses have adapted to containment measures, ensuring that the blow from each lockdown has lessened.</p><p>However, elevated inflation could prevent central banks and governments from spraying economies with stimulus in the event of renewed widespread lockdowns.</p><p>\"That's the big cause for concern: Is policy able to respond and bail out markets and economies this time given inflation?\" said Edward Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Rathbone Investment Management. Trouble in supply chainsstemming from shutdowns could further boost inflation, he added.</p><p>International stock markets tumbled. Losses for travel, leisure, banking and energy stocks—all of which suffered during previous periods of economic turmoil in the pandemic—led the Stoxx Europe 600 to shed 3.7%. The pan-continental gauge was on track for its biggest one-day loss this year.</p><p>In Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 2.7% and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 2.5%. China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.6%. Japan's yen, which typically strengthens in times of market stress, gained against the dollar.</p><p>Technology stocks wilted after Bloomberg reported that China had asked Didi Global to devise a plan to delist in the U.S. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported the ride-hailing giant was considering going private, partly to placate Chinese authorities, and that regulators in China had suggested it list in Hong Kong. Shares in SoftBank Group, whose Vision Fund is a major backer of Didi, fell 5.2% in Tokyo.</p><p>Suryatapa Bhattacharya contributed reporting.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Quentin Webb at quentin.webb@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks, Oil Drop on Concerns Over New Covid-19 Variant</p>",
