They have also capitalised on a surge in energy and commodity prices, fuelled by supply chain bottlenecks and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>“Now is one of those 2008 moments where everyone [in trend-following] is doing well again. The trends are clearer,” said Leda Braga, founder of Systematica Investments and former head of systematic trading at BlueCrest.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

FT reporter Taylor Nicole Rogers returned to the otherwise unremarkable street corner in Minneapolis where Floyd was murdered to find <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7802afe1-ca09-4aef-8485-0c9d8cdea980\">a city still grappling with the legacy</a> of the events of May 25 2020. </p> <p><em>Yesterday we incorrectly said was the two-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder.
