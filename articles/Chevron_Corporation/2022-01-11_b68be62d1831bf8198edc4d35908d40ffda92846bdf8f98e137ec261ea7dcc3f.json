  "title": "What's Happening in Kazakhstan? How the Protests Started and Why Russia Is Involved; Moscow is preparing to withdraw troops it sent to shore up Kazakh government after civil unrest erupted in former Soviet republic",
  "text": "<p>A stage-by-stage pullout of contingents of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance that includes several former Soviet states, would take no more than 10 days, Mr. Tokayev said. The president also named a loyalist as prime minister and signed an executive order to appoint other ministers as part of a new government.</p><p>What is Russia saying about the withdrawal?</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it was entirely the prerogative of Kazakhstan whether it still needed the alliance troops to remain or wanted them to withdraw, since it was the country that had requested the support.</p><p>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the troops would continue to carry out tasks in Kazakhstan until the situation is stable, but only by the decision of the country's leadership.</p><p>Russia has more than 75 military transport planes carrying soldiers, armored personnel carriers, supplies and military vehicles into the country. Some 2,500 soldiers were expected to take part in the mission.</p><p>The troops' primary role has been to guard critical and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>What led to the protests?</p><p>The protests erupted on Jan. 2, a day after a steep rise in the price of fuel, specifically liquefied petroleum gas, went into force. The price of this car fuel had been capped, and its doubling threatened to have a significant impact on workers. Though Kazakhstan is an oil-rich nation, the minimum wage is less than the equivalent of around $100 a month.</p><p>Protesters took to the streets and clashed with security forces. Footage on social media showed cars set ablaze and police deploying tear gas as crowds tried to storm some government buildings. Almaty residents say they heard gunfire as the demonstrations turned into a broader display of frustration with the country's leaders. There were local media reports of gunfire at the presidential residence and mayor's office.</p><p>At the height of the turmoil, the government shut down access or disrupted connections to many websites and social-media platforms. Protesters briefly seized parts of the airport, disrupting flights.</p><p>Mr. Tokayev subsequently ordered authorities to reduce the fuel price.</p><p>The unrest has since calmed down, and by Tuesday a sense of normalcy started to return to the country. Residents began to cautiously go about their everyday lives in Almaty, which will remain under an 11 p.m.-to-7 a.m. curfew until Jan. 19.</p><p>On Tuesday, residents said shops were beginning to open during specific daytime hours, construction sites were operating and some public transportation had resumed. The sound of machine gunfire and the smell of tear gas had gone, they said. City police officers, who had largely disappeared when the troops arrived, were also back on the streets, residents said. But the city was dotted with armed checkpoints and at night sirens and loudspeakers reminded residents of the curfew, they said.</p><p>What were protesters demanding?</p><p>Although the unrest started over the fuel-price increase, protesters are also unhappy with Kazakhstan's political system and socioeconomic issues. Human-rights activists accuse the government of oppression, including jailing critics, to maintain control. The authorities reject the allegations.</p><p>Kazakh officials say the crisis was caused by outside forces who hijacked initially peaceful demonstrations, threatening to destabilize the country, an important ally of Russia with strategic significance in Central Asia.</p><p>Mr. Tokayev has promised to listen to grievances by establishing a public forum to discuss issues. Political analysts say the government hasn't always fully implemented its plans for transforming the country and years of tough authoritarian rule have created deep mistrust and demand for change.</p><p>What comes next?</p><p>Mr. Tokayev has promised a political transformation. He accepted the government's resignation on Jan. 5</p><p>On Tuesday, he named Alikhan Smailov as prime minister. The 49-year-old official, who had been serving as interim prime minister, was finance minister between 2018 and 2020.</p><p>The Kazakh president said he would present a new package of political reforms to the country in September that would be prepared through constructive dialogue with experts and members of civil society.</p><p>The turmoil nudged up crude-oil prices—Kazakhstan is a member of the OPEC+ alliance—and sent uranium prices higher. Kazakhstan accounts for around 40% of the global supply of the mineral.</p><p>On Sunday, U.S. oil major Chevron Corp., which owns 50% in the joint venture that runs Kazakhstan's giant Tengiz oil field, said it was returning production to normal after cutting it due to logistical issues caused by protests at the facility, which has an output capacity of 600,000 barrels a day.</p><p>Has there been a history of upheaval in Kazakhstan?</p><p>Public protest is rare in Kazakhstan, where dissent isn't widely welcomed or tolerated. However, mass demonstrations erupted just before Mr. Tokayev took office in June 2019. He was handpicked to succeed longtime president and autocrat Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had ruled Kazakhstan since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p><p>Local critics called Mr. Tokayev's election undemocratic because other candidates weren't given a fair chance. Many Kazakhs have long felt sidelined from the political decision-making process.</p><p>In 2011, authorities shot at oil workers in western Kazakhstan who were protesting over unpaid wages, killing more than a dozen of them. Human-rights workers said the number of dead could have been in the dozens.</p><p>What does this mean for Russia?</p><p>Kazakhstan shares a trade union and other strategic partnerships with Russia. Mr. Tokayev and his predecessor Mr. Nazarbayev, who has continued to wield political influence behind the scenes, both have the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Russia's foreign ministry has said that Moscow supported \"a peaceful solution to all problems within the framework of the constitutional and legal field and dialogue, and not through street riots and violation of laws.\"</p><p>The unrest on Russia's southern border comes as Mr. Putin tries to fend off what he describes as the West's encroachment on Moscow's traditional sphere of influence in Belarus and Ukraine. The Russian leader has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine, which is seeking closer ties with the West. Mr. Putin has demanded that the U.S. and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies forswear any expansion east toward Russia's borders, in what is turning into a significant security challenge for the Biden administration.</p><p>Write to Ann M.
