  "title": "Shell Argues Against Activist Investor's Call to Split; Oil giant, like others, is grappling with competing demands from shareholders over how to play the energy transition",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, New York-based hedge fund Third Point, run by activist investor Daniel Loeb, said it had taken a stake in Shell and suggested it should split into different companies—for instance, separating its legacy oil business from its liquefied-natural gas and renewable energy operations—to retain and attract investors.</p><p>Analysts said Thursday that while the activist's suggestion might appeal to some shareholders, they were skeptical about the benefit of a breakup or that any major change would ensue.</p><p>Still, Third Point's ideas highlight a growing debate within the energy industry as to how the world's largest oil-and-gas companies should play the transition to lower-carbon energy. Oil majors are coming under growing pressure from investors, environmental groups and governments to accelerate their shift out of fossil fuels and ramp up investments in cleaner energy.</p><p>At the same time, some shareholders have questioned how oil companies will transition profitably in areas where they don't have a competitive edge, and think they should stick to fossil fuels and focus on returns to investors.</p><p>Earlier this year, Exxon Mobil Corp. came under pressure from activist shareholder Engine No. 1 to do more to transition to lower-carbon fuels. Now Shell, which has moved faster than Exxon to remake its business and reduce emissions, is being criticized by Third Point for trying and failing to meet competing demands from shareholders.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. van Beurden said he disagreed with the notion that splitting up Shell would benefit the energy transition or the company.</p><p>\"We are able to do things with the collections of assets, business models [and] customer-facing businesses that we have that is very hard to replicate if you were just [to] split up in a number of other companies,\" he told reporters.</p><p>\"A very significant part of this energy transition that we are talking about is going to be funded by the legacy business,\" he added.</p><p>Shell said it had held discussions with Third Point several times over the past year and would continue to listen to their feedback as it does with all of its shareholders.</p><p>Third Point had given Shell a preview of its thesis ahead of issuing its investor letter, saying it believes in the company but thinks there's a disconnect with the shareholder base that a split could address, people familiar with the matter said. Shell responded in an open-ended way, as is typical for a company at this stage of an activist campaign, indicating it appreciated Third Point's perspective and would give it some thought, the people added.</p><p>Urging companies to break up to allow faster-growing operations to shine on their own has long been a common demand of activists. Several high-profile campaigns have centered around this idea, including Carl Icahn's 2014 bid to get eBay Inc. to spin off PayPal, which he and others considered its crown jewel. Third Point in 2018 urged industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp. to split into three companies when it was already considering such a move. UTC changed course the following year by unveiling a merger with Raytheon Co. that Mr. Loeb criticized.</p><p>Energy Watch</p><p>Recent WSJ columns on Shell and the oil business</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Third Point Doesn't Have the Answer for Shell</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Oil's Topsy-Turvy Moment</p><p>In recent weeks, fellow activist Jana Partners LLC called on Macy's Inc. to separate its fast-growing e-commerce business from its bricks-and-mortar business, similar to a move Saks Fifth Avenue has already taken.</p><p>Aside from investors, Shell is also facing growing pressure from environmental groups and others to move faster to decarbonize. In May a Dutch court ruled that Shell must curb its operational emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels, while making best efforts to also achieve this on its products.</p><p>While Shell is appealing the Dutch ruling, on Thursday it pledged to halve its carbon-dioxide emissions from its operations by the end of the decade compared with 2016 levels. The new pledge didn't include emissions linked to the use of its products.</p><p>Earlier this year, Shell said it would gradually reduce its oil output and expand in electricity and biofuels, while reducing the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.</p><p>However, that strategy has drawn a lukewarm reception from investors, partly because the uncertainties around the energy transition make it difficult to predict future profits.</p><p>Analysts said shareholders could be receptive to Third Point's ideas, as by creating different companies, each could attract separate sets of investors with conflicting ideas for the company's strategic direction. However, they also noted the benefit of being a large, diversified company.</p><p>\"The challenge of management is you've got to navigate your way through all these different pushes and pulls,\" said Alastair Syme, an analyst at Citi, referring to governments, shareholders and environmental groups. But he said he wasn't convinced breaking up the company was the answer.</p><p>Others also expressed skepticism. \"It's about having this broad sweep of products where they're a one-stop shop, on that basis, I see integration as a huge foundation,\" for the company's success in the energy transition, said Oswald Clint, analyst at Bernstein. A breakup, he said, was \"not something I believe will happen.\"</p><p>There are diverging views among companies on how to approach the energy transition. Exxon and Chevron Corp. have stuck with oil and gas for the most part, while others including BP PLC, TotalEnergies SE and Shell have ramped up spending on low-carbon energy. Other smaller European companies, including Italy's Eni SpA and Spain's Repsol SA, are already considering splitting out their lower-carbon operations to offer investors more focus.</p><p>Shell's comments Thursday came as the company reported a third-quarter loss on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis—a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—of $988 million, down from a profit of $177 million in the same period last year, as higher energy prices were outweighed by one-off charges.</p><p>Shell's shares closed down 2.3% in London.</p><p>Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>Shell Argues Against Activist Investor's Call to Split</p>",
