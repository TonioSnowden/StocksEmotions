  "title": "U.S. News: Chevron Foe Gets Six Months",
  "text": "<p>Before handing down the sentence of six months and a $10 fee, Judge Preska said Mr. Donziger's conduct had shown an astonishing disrespect for the law and the authority of federal courts.</p><p>\"Mr. Donziger spent the last seven plus years thumbing his nose at the U.S. judicial system,\" she said. \"It's now time to pay the piper.\"</p><p>Mr. Donziger, who has spent two years in home confinement, vowed to appeal. \"I cannot today express remorse for actions I maintain are ethical and legal,\" he told the judge.</p><p>He said the toll on his family and human-rights work had been punishment enough. Some of his supporters were at the courthouse Friday.</p><p>In her July ruling, Judge Preska concluded that \"at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.\"</p><p>Mr. Donziger in 1993 first accused Texaco Inc. of polluting a swath of previously pristine rainforest, arguing in a New York lawsuit that the company's drilling activities ruined the quality of life for local indigenous communities. Chevron later acquired Texaco and assumed its legal defense.</p><p>The company pushed back, successfully moving the dispute to Ecuador, where a protracted trial ended in a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. The win, however, was fleeting, with Chevron accusing Mr. Donziger and his allies of manipulating the proceeding even before the final judgment was entered.</p><p>That dispute brought the battle back to the U.S., where Chevron won a civil racketeering lawsuit codifying its theory that the Ecuadorean judgment was the product of ghostwriting and other inappropriate acts.</p><p>Chevron has denied any culpability for lasting oil damage in the jungle.</p>",
