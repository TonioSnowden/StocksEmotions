  "title": "Venezuela Sanctions Relief Is a Trap for Biden; Maduro wants concessions but has zero interest in free and fair elections.",
  "text": "<p>Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, captured the sentiments of American hawks in a statement to the Biden administration on May 17: \"Giving Maduro a handful of undeserved handouts just so his regime will promise to sit down at a negotiating table is a strategy destined to fail.\"</p><p>The potential effects of this backlash on U.S. midterm elections seems to have gotten the attention of the administration—and sent it backpedaling. Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the Western Hemisphere, warned in a May 19 Bloomberg interview that any unilateral relief would not improve life for the ordinary Venezuelan but only \"line the pockets of the regime.\"</p><p>On Tuesday a State Department spokesperson told me that the \"overall sanctions policy on Venezuela remains unchanged, and we will continue to implement and enforce our Venezuela sanctions.\"</p><p>Reuters, however, reported last week that a U.S. license held by Chevron to do business in Venezuela will be extended and will include \"'narrow' authorization\" for the company to negotiate with the regime \"on future activities.\" A nephew of Mr. Maduro's wife is also reportedly to be removed from the U.S. sanctions list.</p><p>Either of those things would be changes to U.S. policy, however small. Press reports cite unnamed officials who claim that they're carrots designed to bring Mr. Maduro to talks on restoring democracy in support of internationally recognized Venezuelan interim President Juan Guaidó. If so, the regime didn't bite. Deputy dictator Delcy Rodríguez tweeted her hope that the policy change would \"pave the way\" for lifting all sanctions. She made no mention of a path to new elections.</p><p>If the Menendez camp doesn't have confidence that the administration is committed to restoring democracy, it's speaking from experience.</p><p>Team Biden is populated with veterans from the Obama administration, which cozied up to Havana in 2014-15. The 44th U.S. president normalized relations with Cuba and pushed for commercial ties between the two countries. In 2016, while hundreds of political prisoners were rotting in Cuban dungeons, Mr. Obama traveled to the island and posed for photo-ops with Raúl Castro at a baseball game.</p><p>Havana has since unleashed a series of unprecedented crackdowns, most notably after the island-wide July 11 uprising last year. Yet earlier this month the administration lifted a Trump cap on U.S. remittances to the island, removed some travel restrictions and opened the door to U.S. financing of Cuban businesses, which require regime approval.</p><p>These changes will increase dollar flows to the military, a Russia ally. The moves are hard to square with Mr. Gonzalez's warning against unilaterally lifting sanctions on Venezuela.</p><p>Another Obama project was Colombia's surrender—made up of a drip-drip-drip of concessions—to the pro-Cuba rebel group FARC in 2016. The agreement has provoked renewed violence in the country.</p><p>Opponents of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela tried to defend the rule of law using institutions. In 2002 the military refused his orders to employ force against unarmed demonstrators and briefly detained him, hoping to remove him from power. Connecticut's then-Sen. Chris Dodd reacted furiously, accusing the Bush administration, without evidence, of being behind the military's action. He pushed for the budding dictator to be reinstated.</p><p>It was classic Dodd, a Sandinista enthusiast during the Cold War and at one time a frequent visitor to Cuba. Mr. Dodd is now a K-Street lobbyist. But the Biden administration recently tapped him as a \"special advisor\" to the White House's Ninth Summit of the Americas to be held in Los Angeles, June 6-10. Apparently more high-profile Castro-admirer Bernie Sanders wasn't available.</p><p>Reuters cited \"people close to the talks\" when it reported on Tuesday that \"U.S. officials are now waiting for Venezuela to put a date on resuming political dialogue with the government opposition,\" which could be a \"determinant in crafting the Chevron license.\"</p><p>The trouble is that the regime has a 20-year history of \"negotiations.\" If merely agreeing to return to the table is enough for Mr. Maduro to win sanctions relief, the U.S. is willfully walking into a trap—again.</p><p>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com</p><p>Venezuela Sanctions Relief Is a Trap for Biden</p>",
