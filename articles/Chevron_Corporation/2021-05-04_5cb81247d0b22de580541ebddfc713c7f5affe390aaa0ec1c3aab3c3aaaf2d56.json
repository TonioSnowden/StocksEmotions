  "text": "<p>Norway's Telenor has written off its entire $782m investment in Myanmar but insisted it would remain in the country for now despite internet shutdowns, pressure on staff, and deteriorating operating conditions since a military coup in February.&#xa0;</p> <p>The telecoms group said on Tuesday it had fully impaired its Nkr6.5bn investment in the south-east Asian nation, where it is seen as a cornerstone foreign investor, as it reported a first-quarter loss. The write-off will serve as the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba39960d-e267-40e8-8907-ff921506e285\">blow to business confidence</a> in Myanmar's economy, where output has plummeted during three months of civil unrest.</p> <p>Sigve Brekke, Telenor chief executive, said he believed the Norwegian government-controlled company could still “make a difference” in Myanmar where it was the first telecoms operator to come out against a new security law.</p> <p>“You should look at that as an impairment or writedown, not an exit,” he added.</p> <p>Brekke said that Telenor faced a number of dilemmas in being in Myanmar including ensuring the safety of its employees and serving its 18m customers there when it has been ordered to shut down data networks.</p> <p>On human rights, the chief executive said that its opposition to the new security law had not drawn a response from the military leaders. “This is the dilemma — how can we operate in a country with a military dictatorship without jeopardising our values? As it stands now, we think we are balancing that.”</p> <p>The impairment pushed Telenor to a quarterly net loss of Nkr3.9bn, compared with net income of Nkr698m in the first quarter of 2020.</p> <p>“This is not surprising,” said Romain Caillaud, a principal at Tokyo-based advisory firm SIPA Partners and associate fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “The domestic context in Myanmar makes it very difficult — if not impossible — for Telenor to continue operating in Myanmar as per its global standards and commitments.”</p> <p>Telenor, which operates one of Myanmar's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d09f398e-60f5-4f63-99b0-22e1f4edbb09\">four telecoms companies</a>, has suffered from General Min Aung Hlaing's crackdown on communications and dissent since the military commander toppled Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government after making ungrounded claims of election fraud.&#xa0;</p> <p>The junta first ordered Telenor and other telecoms companies to block popular social media sites such as Facebook, before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e03cfc01-cf06-487d-8c45-0944f21c733a\">shutting off internet services</a> every night and finally making them cut off most remaining mobile and wireless internet communications.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since the coup, regime troops have killed 766 people and jailed more than 3,600, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, a human rights group.&#xa0;</p> <p>The unrest has put Telenor in an uncomfortable position at a time when anti-coup campaigners have called for companies to withhold payments or investments that might benefit&#xa0;the Myanmar regime. </p> <p>Telenor <a href=\"https://www.telenor.com/media/announcement/telenor-myanmar-pays-annual-licence-fee-under-strong-protest-calls-for-immediate-opening-of-data-network\">said</a> in March that it would pay Myanmar's state telecoms regulator its annual licence fee but registered what it called a “strong protest” against the regime's crackdowns on mobile internet, the rule of law and human rights.</p> <p>Since the coup, Japanese brewer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/209f5ca9-0a09-42cd-b72c-b6897a7f643e\">Kirin</a> and South Korean shipbuilder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc20f766-9e39-4b4d-9c4f-c793f9ab09bb\">Posco </a>have announced that they would quit joint ventures with military-backed partners in Myanmar. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea895276-6405-4f4c-9ca6-55b17de095c3\">Total </a>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13c27ea1-d0eb-4652-be6c-4426977b043a\">Chevron</a>, investors in the country's main gasfield, have rejected campaigners' calls to withhold tax payments to the military, which they said would break the law and put local staff in danger.</p> <p><em>Follow John Reed and Richard Milne on Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnReedwrites\"><em>@JohnReedwrites</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmilneNordic\"><em>@rmilneNordic</em></a><br></p><p>Source: John Reed in Bangkok and Richard Milne in Oslo 2021 'Telenor writes off $782m Myanmar business following coup' FT.com 4 May.
