  "text": "<p>PayPal Holdings Inc.</p><p>PayPal unpinned itself from talks to purchase Pinterest. The payments giant abandoned the potential $40 billion-plus takeover when its shares fell almost 12% in three days after the discussions surfaced. Buying Pinterest—an image-sharing site where users swap recipes and home-decor ideas—would have connected PayPal with consumers as they considered what to buy. But Pinterest has struggled to fully capture the benefits of its role in e-commerce. PayPal's board and management decided to back away after determining the decline in the shares, along with other issues in the early-stage talks, would make coming to an agreement unlikely, The Wall Street Journal reported. PayPal shares added 2.7% Monday.</p><p>Robinhood Markets Inc.</p><p>Robinhood is missing out on crypto's new top dog. Nearly two-thirds of the trading app's cryptocurrency revenue in the third quarter was attributable to dogecoin transactions, a parody token named after an internet meme centered on the image of a Shiba Inu dog with bad spelling habits. A separate Shiba Inu coin—like dogecoin, an homage to the Japanese dog breed—is surging in value but Robinhood hasn't added Shiba Inu to its platform and is missing out on demand for the digital asset. A sharp drop in cryptocurrency trading cut into the app's third-quarter revenue. Robinhood shares lost 10% Wednesday.</p><p>Tesla Inc.</p><p>The trillion-dollar club has a new member: Tesla. Investors pushed the electric-vehicle maker's market value past $1 trillion Monday after Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ordered 100,000 autos to be delivered by the end of next year. The bulk purchase promises to expose more mainstream drivers to Tesla's technology. Tesla, which last week reported record quarterly profit, is worth more than the next nine largest auto makers by market capitalization combined. Tesla's stock also benefited after Hertz said Wednesday it is linking up with Uber Technologies Inc. to make 50,000 Teslas available in Uber's ride-sharing network by 2023. Tesla shares soared 13% Monday.</p><p>McDonald's Corp.</p><p>Prepare to pay McMore. McDonald's is raising menu prices to keep pace with rapidly growing labor and commodity costs. The burger giant is struggling to recruit enough workers to serve customers as quickly as possible and keep its stores open at full hours, even as the chain offers higher pay. The company is also paying more for paper, food and other supplies. Those higher costs are making their way to consumers, as McDonald's executives said they expect U.S. prices to be up about 6% this year compared with last year. The company said that higher prices and bigger order sizes increased its revenue in the U.S. in the recent quarter. McDonald's shares rose 2.7% Wednesday.</p><p>Facebook Inc.</p><p>Facebook is going Meta. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company is changing its name to Meta Platforms Inc. to reflect growth opportunities beyond its namesake social-media platform in online digital realms known as \"the metaverse.\" The rebranding comes as Facebook faces intense criticism from lawmakers, researchers and users over revelations in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series, which showed that the company knows its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm. The company's shares, starting Dec. 1, are slated to trade under the stock symbol MVRS, giving up the two-letter format it had with FB. Facebook shares rose 1.5% Thursday.</p><p>Chevron Corp.</p><p>Rising prices are energizing oil giants. The two largest U.S. oil companies, Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp., reported on Friday their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the onset of the global pandemic. The industry is reaping the rewards of resurgent commodity prices as the economy emerges from Covid-19 driven stagnation, with U.S. crude prices topping $80 a barrel this month for the first time since 2014. Global energy demand is rebounding faster than anticipated, and global oil production, while still rising, is struggling to catch up with the surge in consumption. Chevron shares gained 1.2% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Apple, Tesla, Robinhood: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
