  "title": "Business News: ConocoPhillips Bets On Texas Drilling For the Long Term",
  "text": "<p>ConocoPhillips has been among the biggest spenders in the recent consolidation wave. It closed a $9.7 billion purchase of Permian oil producer Concho Resources Inc. in January, before disclosing its plans to buy Shell's assets on Monday.</p><p>When its Shell deal closes in the fourth quarter, ConocoPhillips' oil and gas production in the Lower 48 U.S. states will overtake that of Chevron Corp., natural gas driller EQT Corp. and oil producers Occidental Petroleum Corp. and EOG Resources Inc., according to the consulting firm Rystad Energy.</p><p>Adding an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day will put ConocoPhillips within striking distance of leader Exxon Mobil Corp., which is expected to produce about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from the Lower 48 this year, the company said.</p><p>ConocoPhillips shares rose 4% Tuesday, as other energy stocks including Exxon and Chevron were flat.</p><p>The spending spree marks an about-face in strategy for the Houston company. For years, ConocoPhillips had focused on shrinking its size, spinning off its refining business -- now Phillips 66 -- halting exploration of deep-water fields, and selling off Canadian assets.</p><p>In an interview, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said that while scale was important in the oil business, growing in size wasn't the driving force behind its recent deals. \"We believe it has some of the best rocks,\" Mr. Lance said of the Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, and has what oil experts describe as multiple levels of geologic deposits companies can tap, akin to layers of a wedding cake.</p><p>Shell's assets will generate an additional $20 billion in cash from operations for ConocoPhillips and another $10 billion for its shareholders over a decadelong period. The company is sending about $6 billion back to shareholders this year, about 8% of its market capitalization, he said.</p><p>\"What's important is giving a significant amount of your cash back to your shareholders and then having a portfolio you can live off of and modestly grow your company,\" Mr. Lance said.</p>",
