  "text": "<p>ExxonMobil has registered its highest profits since 2014, capitalising on strong oil and natural gas prices in a sharp reversal from the early months of the pandemic. </p> <p>The US oil supermajor on Tuesday reported net profit of $23bn in 2021 compared with a $22.4bn loss suffered as fuel demand collapsed in 2020. The company's fourth-quarter profit of $8.9bn easily beat Wall Street expectations of $8.4bn, according to estimates compiled by S&amp;P Capital IQ. </p> <p>The results showed the financial benefits of increasingly tight energy markets for the world's largest oil and gas producers. Chevron, Exxon's main US rival, last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/984501a6-f880-485e-abd1-cd03bd7b5b67\">reported </a>annual net profit of $15.6bn after a loss of $5.5bn in 2020. Financial statements from Europe-based peers are due this month. </p> <p>Exxon said it was using the influx of cash to launch a $10bn share buyback programme, adding that it had paid back much of the debt it took on during the 2020 downturn.</p> <p>“Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down-cycle, and structural cost savings positioned us to realise the full benefits of the market recovery in 2021,” said Darren Woods, chief executive.</p> <p>Brent crude prices surged to more than $91 a barrel earlier this week for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70f58398-8911-45d3-b1b0-cc16c4ac184d\">first time since 2014</a> as a global recovery in oil demand strains supplies. </p> <p>Exxon shares rose 6.1 per cent to $80.57 early on Tuesday and have surged more than 20 per cent since the start of the year, making the stock one of the best performers in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cf5199c-5538-40b6-a059-d2c795108919\">weak</a> broader market.</p> <p>The group said its output from the vast <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8f8980c-44ca-47b6-9e61-e240ab3162b8\">Permian Basin </a>oilfield in Texas and New Mexico was up 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2021 to 460,000 boe/d. The group also reported rising production from offshore fields in Guyana. </p> <p>The boom in profits comes as Exxon's climate strategy remains under the microscope after it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52645b30-c378-49e3-8609-4f537284889a\">lost a bruising proxy fight</a> last year to the activist hedge fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52645b30-c378-49e3-8609-4f537284889a\">Engine No 1</a>, which brought three new directors on to the oil major's 12-person board. </p> <p>Exxon announced a goal last month to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2aca4b93-aae2-40ea-a1be-9fcb6e4085c9\">reach net zero emissions </a>from its operations by 2050. Critics, however, said the target <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6ff5e7e-c83d-4958-aac2-7766f1302d51\">did not go far enough</a> because it did not include the carbon emitted from burning fuels, which comprises the bulk of emissions associated with the company. </p> <p>Exxon on Monday disclosed a corporate restructuring that elevated its low-carbon division to become one of three large business lines. The business will focus on carbon capture and storage, biofuels and hydrogen.</p> <p>Kathy Mikells, Exxon's chief financial officer, told analysts that the company was “actively” looking at acquisition opportunities for the low-carbon business.</p> <p>As part of the restructuring, Exxon said it planned to move its headquarters from Irving, Texas, in the Dallas area, south to Houston by next year. Senior Exxon executives have been based in the Irving offices, known throughout the industry as the “God Pod”, since 1989. </p><p>Source: Justin Jacobs in Houston 2022 'Exxon registers highest profit since 2014 after boost from oil and gas prices' FT.com 1 February.
