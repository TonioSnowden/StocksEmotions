By 2030 its share of the world's total energy mix will have more than doubled, to 55 per cent, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. And as clean energy rises, fossil fuel demand will plunge. That's the subject of our first note. </p> <p>Our second, by contrast, reflects on an oil sector that, despite the long-term threat to demand, is currently on the up again. Rising crude prices and a rally in oil and gas equities have lifted the mood — at least for now.

Use of natural gas will most likely be limited to producing “blue” hydrogen, coupled with carbon capture and storage technology, and some industrial processes and power generation.</p> <p>Renewables' share of primary energy supply&#xa0;must grow from 14 per cent in 2018 to 74 per cent in 2050 to meet the 1.5C scenario — the preferred case under the 2015 Paris climate accord which agrees to limit global warming to “well below” 2C but hopefully 1.5C.</p> <p>IRENA argues most of the technologies to enable this shift largely already exist but it warns a big ramp-up in investments are needed and the “window of opportunity to achieve the 1.5C Paris Agreement goal is closing fast”.</p> <p>The group, whose 163 members include China, India, the EU, US and the UK, calculates that of the $4.6tn of economic stimulus that governments globally have in place today to support industries such as agriculture, industry, waste, energy and transport only $1.8tn can currently be categorised as “green”.&#xa0;</p> <p>It estimates an average of $4.4tn will need to be invested globally each year to support the energy transition — more than double 2019 levels.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote>  <p>“We need a drastic acceleration of energy transitions to make a meaningful turnround,” said&#xa0;Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA.&#xa0;“As governments pump huge sums in bailouts and recovery, investment must support [the] energy transition.” </p> </blockquote> <p><em>(Nathalie Thomas)</em></p> <h1>Squint and you might just see a drilling boom </h1> <p>Less than 11 months since US crude prices crashed below zero, things are rosier again in the oil sector. Soaring commodity prices are the main reason — a rising tide lifts all boats. But, as I argued in my <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66fe5644-00dd-41db-8802-ea3278f29007\">latest column</a>, the mood has shifted too. Last year was about oil's twilight, as climate policy and the rising cost of capital for fossil fuel producers closed the net on the industry. </p> <p>As I noted in the piece, the surprise last year about oil demand wasn't how far consumption fell, but how much crude consumers still burnt. Now the themes are about whether supply can keep up with a widely forecast demand surge. </p> <p>US shale is the crux. At $65 a barrel — well above what was expected by American shale executives a few months ago — will operators stick with their investor-friendly capital discipline pledge? Or revert to type with another drilling boom?</p> <p>As Justin Jacobs and I report in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c803be61-61ac-4f4c-836a-4ac19265ad45\">new piece</a> this morning, for now it seems discipline is just about holding. Drilling activity is increasing, but not as fast as the oil price. Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, estimates that at around 270, the number of oil-directed horizontal rigs is still about 130 short of what would be needed for total output to start growing again. </p> <p>And US crude output, hovering around 11m barrels a day, is still well shy of the 13m b/d peak before the price crash — and will remain so.</p> <p>But, at $65 a barrel oil, you don't have to look too hard to see another shale surge on the horizon — if not this year, then in 2022. While ExxonMobil has reduced its Permian Basin growth targets, it is still planning significant increases next year — as is Chevron, which never cut its targets in the first place. And, as Alexandre Ramos-Peon, Rystad's senior shale analyst, points out, private-backed drillers are already roaring ahead. He expects more of them to enter the Permian while acreage remains cheap. </p> <p>The US oil price forward curve is starting to add fuel to the fire. Futures prices were signalling doom for the sector not long ago. At the start of February, the December 2021 contract was trading at less than $50/b, a strong signal for drillers to hold back. But that has surged to more than $60 over the past couple of weeks — well above shale producer break-evens — and could lead some to start loosening the purse strings.</p> <p>“The whole non-core Permian works at a $60 price deck and there are large numbers of new commercial opportunities in other basins too in the current market environment,” Rystad noted recently. </p> <p>As Robert Clarke, Wood Mac's vice-president of upstream research, told us, at current prices some of the big independent shale operators are now in a position to satisfy investors by spending within cash flow, paying dividends, and repaying debt, while also — whisper it — increasing production.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“$65 is a big number . . . there is a select group of companies that are going to be in excellent shape,” Clarke said. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>(Derek Brower)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>A sweeping overhaul of Mexico's electricity market has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3a36f0a-0809-4b1a-8e1e-4fe908197f4b\">put on hold by a court</a> just two days after it became law.</p></li>  <li><p>How the Biden $1.9tn stimulus has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6ec60dc-f110-4c84-9229-d516372f5511?shareType=nongift\">poured fuel</a> on a global market shake-up.</p></li>  <li><p>Want a greener world?
