  "title": "Monday's Markets:  Cyclicals Jump as Tech Stocks Retreat  ---  Recent data show  economy picking up,  helping companies like  Chevron, Home Depot  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Caitlin McCabe",
  "text": "<p>   Investors piled into shares of economically sensitive companies and pulled back from technology stocks, leading to a divergence in major indexes as trading kicked off in May. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 238.38 points to 34113.23, as shares of cyclical stocks ranging from Chevron to Dow to Home Depot rallied. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 11.49 points to 4192.66. </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite, in contrast, pulled back, falling 67.56 points, or 0.5%, to 13895.12 after starting the day higher. Megacap technology companies including Amazon.com, Netflix and Facebook weighed on the technology-heavy index. </p><p>   Investors have been heartened lately by signals that economic growth is picking up, with recent data showing that U.S. indicators ranging from consumer spending to jobless claims are improving. Meanwhile, an exceptionally strong earnings season so far -- during which most S&amp;P 500 companies have surpassed analysts' profit expectations -- has added to the optimism. </p><p>   At the same time, however, money managers are assessing the continued spread of Covid-19 in many parts of the world and trying to gauge the outlook for inflation, which could erode investment returns. </p><p>   Rising inflation tends to be particularly problematic for growth and tech stocks, in part because their earnings are expected to come further in the future. </p><p>   \"There is a thin balance between all the positives such as earnings momentum, the reopening, the rollout of vaccines and some limiting factors like [high] valuations and inflation perspectives,\" said Luc Filip, head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"The market will balance between all these positives and negatives, but we believe the positives will outweigh the negatives.\" </p><p>   Investors this week will be paying attention to a busy week of corporate earnings and economic data. Companies including Pfizer, Marathon Oil and Etsy are on tap to report results this week. April jobs figures will also be reported on Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect U.S. employers to have added one million jobs. In March, the U.S. economy added 916,000 jobs. </p><p>   Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in April that officials want to see \"a string of months\" like March to show progress toward the central bank's goals. Fed officials reiterated last week that they will maintain the central bank's policies until the labor market is back to full strength and inflation has reached the goal of averaging 2%. </p><p>   Investors on Monday closely watched Mr. Powell's comments before the National Community Reinvestment Coalition for any additional clues about the Fed's thinking. In his remarks, he noted that the U.S. economic outlook has brightened but added that it has advanced more slowly for low-wage workers. He added that the pandemic has had a significant effect on minority workers and women. </p><p>   \"The Fed is focused on these longstanding disparities because they weigh on the productive capacity of our economy,\" Mr. Powell said in prepared remarks. </p><p>   Earlier on Monday before Mr. Powell's comments, investors also parsed data from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed that its purchasing-managers index of manufacturing activity registered 60.7 in April, versus expectations of 65.0, according to a survey compiled by The Wall Street Journal. Demand expanded, the data showed. But wide-scale shortages of basic materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products were among the issues that continued to affect the manufacturing economy, the report showed. </p><p>   In corporate news, Estee Lauder sank $24.87, or 7.9%, to $288.93 after its quarterly revenue came in below analysts' estimates. </p><p>   Moderna climbed by $7.20, or 4%, to $186.02. The drugmaker said it will supply 34 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to an international program that distributes the shots to developing countries. </p><p>   Among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, the energy and materials groups posted the biggest gains. Companies including Halliburton, Gap and FedEx jumped, with each rising 4.9% or more. </p><p>   In contrast, Amazon tumbled $80.93, or 2.3%, to finish at $3,386.49, while Tesla fell $24.54, or about 3.5%, to $684.90. Facebook shed $2.50, to $322.58. </p><p>   Investors \"are looking to take some chips off the table\" after big technology companies posted strong earnings reports last week, said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.606%. It ended last week at 1.632%, posting its biggest weekly rise since mid-March. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.6%. </p><p>   Early Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.2% and Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 was up 0.3%. Markets in Japan and mainland China were closed for holidays. S&amp;P futures were down 0.3%. </p><p></p>",
