  "title": "Business News: Exxon Unit To Aim For Lower Emissions",
  "text": "<p>Exxon has a large research and development division that has invested in carbon capture for years, and Exxon says it has captured more carbon than any other company. Currently, the only large-scale use for captured carbon is to help produce more fossil fuels by pumping in the gas to squeeze more oil and gas out of the ground.</p><p>\"With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, Exxon Mobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions,\" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.</p><p>Exxon is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday after previously disclosing that it would write down as much as $20 billion in assets. It endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020 and has already posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.</p><p>Following the outbreak of the new coronavirus last year, Exxon discussed a merger with its top U.S. rival, Chevron Corp., The Wall Street Journal has reported. The talks were described as preliminary and aren't going on now.</p><p>The company's woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon's board last week and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.</p><p>Exxon hasn't invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas.</p>",
