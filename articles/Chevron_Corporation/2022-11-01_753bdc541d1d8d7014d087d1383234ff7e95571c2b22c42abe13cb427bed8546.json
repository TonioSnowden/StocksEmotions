  "title": "BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares; Oil major beats expectations in banner year for the world's biggest energy companies",
  "text": "<p>BP said it is boosting its oil-and-gas production, and expects overall full-year production to be \"slightly higher\" in 2022, despite the loss of production from Russia after its decision to exit from the country. BP said it expects high oil-and-gas prices to continue, fueled in part by prolonged energy shortages in Europe.</p><p>BP's earnings come after Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, last week reported around $40 billion in collective profits in the third quarter.</p><p>The bumper haul is drawing political scrutiny from European and U.S. officials and calls for additional taxes on the industry as Russia's war against Ukraine exacerbates high energy costs for consumers and businesses.</p><p>BP said it expects to pay around $800 million toward a new U.K. windfall-profits levy this year, covering seven months that the measure will be in place. That will be part of a projected $2.5 billion in overall 2022 taxes linked to its U.K. North Sea business, the company said.</p><p>On Monday, President Biden called on Congress to penalize oil-and-gas companies if they don't use their profits to help lower energy costs for consumers. However the proposal, coming before next week's U.S. midterm elections, faces hurdles from lawmakers.</p><p>BP's underlying third-quarter profit fell just shy of last quarter's figure, its strongest in more than a decade, boosted by high refining margins and higher oil-and-gas trading results.</p><p>The additional share buyback brings BP's announced stock purchases so far this year to $8.5 billion.</p><p>Shares in BP were down about 1% in morning trading in London.</p><p>BP's reported net result for the third quarter, which takes into account certain accounting effects related to inventory valuations amid price volatility, as well as legal costs from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and other adjustments, was a $2.2 billion loss. However, that reported result was overshadowed by the closely watched underlying $8.2 billion replacement-cost profit.</p><p>BP said it expects total capital expenditure in 2022 to be about $15.5 billion. That figure assumes the completion by year-end of its purchase of U.S. biogas producer Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion including debt, which was announced in October. BP previously forecast capital spending this year at $14 billion to $15 billion.</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>BP Profit Boosted by Natural-Gas Trading, to Buy Back More Shares</p>",
