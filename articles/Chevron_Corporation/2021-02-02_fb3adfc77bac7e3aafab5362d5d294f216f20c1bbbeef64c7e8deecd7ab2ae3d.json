  "text": "<p>Exxon risks flipping an axiom and displeasing all of the people, all of the time. On Tuesday, the once-dominant oil supermajor announced a $22bn loss for 2020 driven partly by asset impairments. Shares have rebounded sharply from last March. But the company's market capitalisation remains less than half its 2014 peak at under $200bn. </p> <p>You could blame this on the global recession that hammered commodity prices and demand.&#xa0;The reality is that 2020 was a milestone year for action on climate change. </p> <p>Asset managers, governments and advocacy groups have never been in tighter alignment over reducing carbon emissions. That has left Exxon and its peers squarely on the defensive.</p> <p>So far, the sector's clean energy initiatives have been relatively modest. Exxon is sticking with oil. Its stopgap strategy is to appeal to income-hungry shareholders. It has prioritised salvaging its dividend — now offering a juicy yield of 7 per cent. But that strategy carries it own risks. If Exxon persists in being an oil company, it must continue spending money to drill for the stuff.</p> <p>In 2019, the year before the pandemic, Exxon had $31bn of capital expenditures. That year, it generated cash flow from operations of $33bn. It disbursed almost $15bn worth of dividends, suggesting it relied on financings to ensure shareholders payments were met.&#xa0;</p> <p>Exxon claims future annual capex will be in the range of $20bn-$25bn and that if oil prices are above $50/barrel it will reach cash flow break-even. A rumoured tie-up with Chevron would help slash cash expenses and investments too. Exxon has also announced that it will spend $3bn on “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/130043ba-9981-40d3-ac24-8e9a3fe0b1a7\">carbon capture</a>” technologies while working to reduce carbon emission from drilling.</p> <p>These moves have not been enough to repel <a href=\"https://reenergizexom.com/\">climate-focused activist investors </a>who want more radical action. The maths around cash flow have already unwittingly forced Exxon to curtail uneconomic exploration efforts. If the Exxon dividend is eventually cut because oil production cannot keep pace with shareholder demands, these activists will consider themselves vindicated.</p> <p><em>What do you think of Exxon and climate change?
