  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2%, or 620.74 points, to 29982.62, and the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.9%, or 73.14 points, to 3714.24, a day after both gained roughly 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 2%, or 266.46 points, to 13070.69.</p><p>Longtime investor favorites Amazon , Tesla and Facebook Inc . all fell Friday and for the week. So did Apple Inc . and Google parent Alphabet Inc . Declines in those shares appear directly related to the Reddit-fueled day trading, said Nicholas Colas, founder of DataTrek Research.</p><p>If large investment firms' bets against stocks are losing money, many will need to sell some of their winning positions to rebalance, Mr. Colas said. \"It's a very brute-force explanation,\" he said, \"but fundamentally that's the mechanics of it.\"</p><p>For the week, GameStop soared 400%, and AMC jumped 278%.</p><p>Amazon , Facebook , Tesla and other big companies powered the market higher last year. Some of them benefited from the stay-at-home economy, even as many small businesses were decimated. That left many people struggling to reconcile a different type of market divide throughout 2020: a stumbling economy and a rallying stock market.</p><p>Stock markets seesawed in January, buffeted by up-and-down news about the state of the U.S. economy, the spread of the coronavirus and the success of vaccination efforts. Pharmaceutical company Novavax Inc . soared 65% to $220.94 Friday, after it said its Covid-19 vaccine was 89% effective in a late-stage trial in the U.K. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 3.6% to $163.13 after saying its own vaccine was 66% effective.</p><p>For the month, the Dow fell 2% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1%, even though both set several records throughout January. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of stress in markets, was up 9.5% Friday and rose 45% in January.</p><p>\"Right now the market just can't shake off this frenzied retail trading,\" said Oanda analyst Edward Moya . \"The hedge funds are feeling the pressure.\"</p><p>Robinhood Markets , a popular venue for online traders that had restricted trading in GameStop and AMC , said late Thursday it would reinstate some trading in stocks that it had curbed earlier.</p><p>\"The GameStop story, where you have retail investors that are a new actor on the market, [is] one that people cannot ignore,\" said Luc Filip , head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"There are some critical links for hedge funds that are short on those stocks.\"</p><p>While it is hard to precisely measure social media's effect on politics and people's views, capital markets offer a unique backdrop, said Lindsey Bell , chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. \"You can actually see it at work here in the stock market,\" she said.</p><p>That can make social media's influence seem more dramatic, she said. Still, most trading is controlled by institutional investors: \"They have so much more money.\"</p><p>In economic news, consumer spending in the U.S. declined by 0.2% in December, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis . It fell for the second straight month due to a rise in coronavirus cases, although a little less than economists had predicted. Household incomes rose 0.6%.</p><p>Earnings season continued Friday, with oil major Chevron Corp . falling 4.3% to $85.20 after reporting a loss for the fourth quarter. Skyworks Solutions Inc ., a chip maker that supplies Apple, rose 5.9% to $169.25 after it reported earnings after hours Thursday that beat analysts' estimates. Its board also approved a $2 billion share buyback. Eli Lilly &amp; Co . fell 1% to $207.97 after it posted revenue and earnings that beat expectations and said it expected to make billions in revenue in 2021 from its Covid-19 treatments.</p><p>American Airlines Group Inc ., which on Thursday reported a record loss last year, fell 5.1% to $17.17.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.9% 395.85. The European Union 's comparatively slow rollout of vaccines and recent delays to supply are creating concerns about prolonged lockdowns and weighing on markets, investors said.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined.</p>",
