  "text": "<p>Joe Biden will today call on Congress <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f6510d7-3472-4683-826a-487f43faf907\">to suspend the federal tax on petrol and diesel</a> for three months in a bid to provide some temporary relief to American households grappling with high inflation. </p> <p>Petrol costs have soared to about $5 per gallon in recent weeks and consumer prices are rising at their fastest pace for decades, souring Americans' perceptions of the strength of the US recovery and threatening Democratic chances in midterm elections later this year.</p> <p>The so-called gas tax holiday would involve scrapping the 18.4 cent federal levy on every gallon of petrol, and 24 cent levy on diesel that consumers pay at the pump. </p> <p>But critics say the policy could backfire, boosting demand and contributing to inflation, while failing to provide meaningful relief to families. There is also no guarantee that it would be approved by Congress.</p> <p>The Biden announcement comes a day after the president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6a9e937-1b5e-4c5b-8338-1e112ee0be0d\">hit out at Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth</a>, calling the oil major boss “sensitive” after he criticised the US administration's energy policy.</p> <p>The president, who will meet oil company executives on Thursday, has increased his criticism of domestic producers in recent weeks. He said ExxonMobil was “making more than God this year” and told the oil supermajor to “start investing more”. He also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4a8b34e-8253-49c2-bb2c-2b9708095648\">criticised the industry's elevated profits</a> as “unacceptable” during “a time of war”, as conflict rages in Ukraine.</p> <p>The president's comments are part of a strategy to alleviate pressure at the pumps for US consumers. Earlier this year he ordered the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/030b0042-9e51-44ae-8f62-e14f439450ef\">biggest ever release</a> of oil from the US strategic petroleum reserve and next month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53fd02c5-4392-4347-9c9c-97596dfc8d4d\">will travel to Saudi Arabia</a> for talks with a regime he once considered a “pariah”. </p> <p>The Biden announcement comes on the same day that the head of the International Energy Administration, a western energy watchdog, warned Europe to prepare for Russia to cut off exports of gas this winter. </p> <p>“Europe should be ready in case Russian gas is completely cut off,” Fatih Birol <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7990162-395f-488e-9d23-13f3cce83e24\">told the Financial Times in an interview</a>.</p> <p>The briefing from the White House ahead of Biden's announcement appeared to bring lower US oil prices. US West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, was down nearly 6 per cent earlier today at $104.15 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was 4.5 per cent lower at $109.55 a barrel.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

It may not even be dying. But it is changing, writes Martin Wolf. From treating trade as optional to overstating the merits of self-sufficiency, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa1f3a82-99c5-4fb2-8bff-a7e8d3f65849\">Martin outlines the anti-globalisers' big mistakes</a>.</p> <p><strong>A corporate feud over satellites pits the west against China </strong>In February, European financiers and entrepreneurs gathered for a late-night online meeting to resolve a boardroom dispute over prized satellite permits. At its core was the question: who controls an asset in orbit? Here's how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1f342ab-d931-44ca-bf0d-f7762db76982\">a clash of cultures</a> and geostrategic interests sank a German-Chinese joint venture.</p> <p><strong>Anarchy is a likelier future for the west than tyranny </strong>The story of our species is mostly one of disorder, not too much order. Even now, the state, a recent invention, is patchy and provisional in much of the world. Janan Ganesh argues that the trend of events is not towards strongmen but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38dfc217-742e-4d7e-b926-0fdc937f9be4\">towards ungovernability</a>.</p> <p><strong>How boards can keep up with climate action expectations </strong>HSBC's bus stop adverts. BlackRock's investment plans. BP and Microsoft's carbon offsets. Green policy is turning into the fast-fashion of business strategy. Pilita Clark explains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a47c884a-f141-4252-84fe-08ffdf79a6df\">how to navigate this shifting landscape</a>.</p> <p><strong>Regrets? We've all had a few but they can help your career</strong> In this week's Working It podcast, senior business writer Andrew Hill talks to the bestselling author Daniel Pink. In <em>The Power of Regret, </em>Pink urges us to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/957c05e6-d2aa-4024-84e2-f495fb94fce3\">think differently about our workplace regrets</a> and reframe our past to show us the path to a better future.</p> <h1>Books</h1> <p>Earlier this year, we published a rundown of private libraries around the globe.
