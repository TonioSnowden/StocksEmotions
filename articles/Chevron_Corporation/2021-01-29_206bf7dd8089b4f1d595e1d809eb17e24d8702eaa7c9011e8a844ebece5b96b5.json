  "text": "<p>US oil company Chevron slumped to its third straight quarterly loss, disappointing Wall Street and underlining the damage inflicted on even the industry's biggest groups by the price crash. </p> <p>The second-biggest US oil company reported a loss of $665m in the final quarter of last year, compared with a loss of $207m in the third quarter. The loss per share was $0.33, compared with analysts' expectations of a $0.07 per share gain. </p> <p>“2020 was a year like no other,” said Mike Wirth, Chevron's chief executive. He added that the company ended the year “with a strong balance sheet, having completed a major acquisition and increased our dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year”.</p> <p>Adjusted for currency effects and charges relating to its acquisition of Noble Energy, which closed last quarter, Chevron said its loss was $11m, or $0.01 per diluted share.</p> <p>Like rivals, Chevron has had to grapple with a year marked by a global oil price war and collapse in crude demand that at one point drove benchmark US prices below zero. The group's full-year loss was $5.5bn, compared with a profit of $2.9bn in 2019.</p> <p>Revenue of $94.7bn in 2020 marked Chevron's second worst year this century. Despite the sharp decline in revenues, the company held its quarterly dividend steady at $1.29.</p> <p>Mr Wirth pointed to cost savings during the year, with capital expenditure falling to $13.5bn from $21bn in 2019.</p> <p>In December, Chevron reduced planned capital expenditure to $14bn this year and set an annual cap of $22bn through to 2025. It has also scaled back its projections for near-term production growth, including in the prolific Permian shale of the US. </p> <p>As the first oil major to report its earnings this year, Chevron's numbers will be closely watched for signs of the industry's health. The big three oilfield services companies, often a bellwether for the global oil sector, all pointed to a slow but steady recovery when they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8203bcd-c5b5-40a7-943c-c230115d6931\">reported their earnings</a> this month. </p> <p>Chevron said fourth-quarter production was flat at 2.08m barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, with new production from the Noble Energy acquisition offsetting curtailments elsewhere.</p> <p>The company's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/604c2b56-74b9-4e31-9775-06a78296acde\">$13bn acquisition of Noble</a> — the first big move in a wave of mergers that swept through the battered US oil sector last year — closed in the fourth quarter. In pre-market trading the company's shares fell almost 2 per cent on the earnings miss.</p><p>Source: Derek Brower and Justin Jacobs 2021 'Chevron disappoints Wall St with third straight quarterly loss  ' FT.com 29 January.
