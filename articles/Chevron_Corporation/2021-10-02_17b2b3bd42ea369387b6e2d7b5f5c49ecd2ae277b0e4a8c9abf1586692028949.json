  "text": "<p>   NEW YORK -- Disbarred attorney Steven Donziger was sentenced Friday to six months in prison for contempt of court after a federal judge concluded that he willfully violated orders stemming from a three-decade-long legal battle against Chevron Corp. over pollution in the Ecuadorean rainforest. </p><p>   Friday's sentencing follows a July ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York finding Mr. Donziger guilty of six counts of criminal contempt of court. She found that he disobeyed court orders as he sought to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment that he won against the oil company in Ecuador and that he was barred from profiting from. </p><p>   Before handing down the sentence of six months and a $10 fee, Judge Preska said Mr. Donziger's conduct had shown an astonishing disrespect for the law and the authority of federal courts. </p><p>   \"Mr. Donziger spent the last seven plus years thumbing his nose at the U.S. judicial system,\" she said. \"It's now time to pay the piper.\" </p><p>   Mr. Donziger, who has spent two years in home confinement, vowed to appeal. \"I cannot today express remorse for actions I maintain are ethical and legal,\" he told the judge. </p><p>   He said the toll on his family and human-rights work had been punishment enough. Some of his supporters were at the courthouse Friday. </p><p>   In her July ruling, Judge Preska concluded that \"at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.\" </p><p>   Mr. Donziger in 1993 first accused Texaco Inc. of polluting a swath of previously pristine rainforest, arguing in a New York lawsuit that the company's drilling activities ruined the quality of life for local indigenous communities. Chevron later acquired Texaco and assumed its legal defense. </p><p>   The company pushed back, successfully moving the dispute to Ecuador, where a protracted trial ended in a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. The win, however, was fleeting, with Chevron accusing Mr. Donziger and his allies of manipulating the proceeding even before the final judgment was entered. </p><p>   That dispute brought the battle back to the U.S., where Chevron won a civil racketeering lawsuit codifying its theory that the Ecuadorean judgment was the product of ghostwriting and other inappropriate acts. </p><p>   Chevron has denied any culpability for lasting oil damage in the jungle. </p><p></p>",
