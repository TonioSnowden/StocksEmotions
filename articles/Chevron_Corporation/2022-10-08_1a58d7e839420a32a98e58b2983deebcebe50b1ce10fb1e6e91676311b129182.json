  "title": "Venezuela's U.S. Creditors Take Small Comfort From Sanctions Relief; Washington's opening to Venezuela points to a possible restructuring, but does little for creditors in the short term",
  "text": "<p>President Nicolás Maduro had asked Wall Street asset managers in recent months to press for an easing of U.S. sanctions to bring more Venezuelan crude oil into world markets—and to provide an opening for restructuring the country's debts. Businesses and bondholders are barred from negotiating with Mr. Maduro's administration, part of a wide-ranging sanctions campaign put in place by the U.S. under former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Biden administration is preparing to let Chevron Corp. resume drilling in Venezuela and to let the country's oil exports flow to U.S. and European markets again, contingent on President Maduro embarking on talks with opposition leaders on holding free and fair elections, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. Some investors and analysts are voicing cautious optimism that other commercial relations with the Venezuelan government will also be allowed to resume, including possible restructuring talks with its creditors.</p><p>While the Chevron deal might suggest that Venezuela's relations with the rest of the world are slowly improving, eased sanctions for oil alone won't assist in progressing toward a meaningful restructuring or refinancing so long as other restrictions are in place, said Husni Almousli, a restructuring lawyer at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP in London. The U.S. opening to Venezuela gives Chevron and possibly other energy companies a way to recoup their joint-venture arrears, while bondholders and other creditors lack an immediate path to seeking repayment from the country.</p><p>Current sanctions preclude investors from having direct contact or negotiation with Mr. Maduro's regime, which makes restructuring talks impossible unless the U.S. relaxes current rules. U.S. investors are also barred from buying the roughly $60 billion in outstanding bonds backed by the Venezuelan government or its state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA.</p><p>In overseas markets where Venezuelan debt still trades, the sovereign and PdVSA bonds change hands for pennies on the dollar and haven't changed materially since the Journal reported on the potential thaw in U.S.-Venezuela relations. A restructuring remains far off and would likely only come after the U.S. sees progress toward free elections in Venezuela, said Pablo Melasecca, co-head of Latin American emerging markets at BTIG.</p><p>\"If sanctions on bond trading are lifted, it would be a major rally given that bonds are stuck at all time lows, but I don't think the U.S. will do that any time soon,\" he said. \"It would give the regime a vehicle through which it can improve its access to capital flows and I don't think that's happening unless there's a path to free and fair elections.\"</p><p>The country's external obligations include roughly $60 billion in outstanding bonds and years of accrued interest following the 2017 default, plus tens of billions of dollars in arbitration judgments stemming from the past nationalization of private investments in Venezuela.</p><p>Creditors have focused their collection efforts in recent years on Venezuela's U.S.-based oil refiner, Citgo Petroleum Corp., the only sizable state asset they can reach through the U.S. court system.</p><p>Citgo faces several lawsuits in U.S. courts from creditors seeking to seize and sell it as compensation for the debts racked up by its owner, PdVSA. The U.S. government since 2019 has shielded Citgo from seizure and placed control of the company with Venezuelan opposition leaders who represent its interests in court.</p><p>Defunct Canadian mining company Crystallex International Corp. is trying to seize and sell Venezuela's stake in Citgo to satisfy a $1 billion judgment, but can't pursue a seizure and forced sale under current sanctions. Bondholders and other multinational companies are also circling Citgo as a potential source of compensation for money owed and property expropriated by Venezuela. A thaw in relations with Mr. Maduro raises questions about whether the U.S. will continue to shield Citgo as a Venezuelan state asset.</p><p>Crystallex lawyer Rahim Moloo said the U.S. should insist that Venezuela abide by court judgments and pay legitimate creditors on the road to normalizing relations.</p><p>Citgo declined to comment on the potential U.S. sanctions relief.</p><p>Some investors who can still buy Venezuelan bonds believe the change in sanctions policy provides a buying opportunity with current prices so low and trading still frozen.</p><p>\"The market is not paying attention to the fact that all the mood music has materially changed over the last 12 months,\" said Lee Robinson, the founder and chief investment officer of London-based Altana Wealth, which holds Venezuela bonds.</p><p>Venezuela and its foreign oil partners like Chevron already face stiff challenges in reviving oil production in the country's energy sector, once among the world's largest but now plagued by underinvestment and corruption. If Venezuela is to start exporting meaningful amounts of crude again, it will face pressure to settle with financial creditors to avoid the risk of oil-shipment seizures.</p><p>Venezuela has previously promoted investment opportunities—including in the oil industry—for foreign asset managers in the event that U.S. sanctions were rolled back.</p><p>The economics of higher oil production are \"hard to separate from the question of the broader restructuring of Venezuelan debt,\" said Mark Weidemaier, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. \"It's really hard to run a robust export economy when you have creditors holding billions and billions of dollars in claims chasing you around.\"</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
