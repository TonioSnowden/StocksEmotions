  "title": "Business News:  UAW Walks Off Job  At CNH Industrial  ----  By Bob Tita",
  "text": "<p>   Workers at CNH Industrial NV walked off their jobs Monday for the first time in nearly 20 years after their union and the farm and construction equipment manufacturer failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. </p><p>   The United Auto Workers-represented employees' contract with CNH, which is based in London, expired early Sunday, but the two sides kept negotiations going through Sunday and into Monday morning. The union said it broke off the talks Monday afternoon and instructed workers to leave their jobs. </p><p>   Neither the union nor the company provided specifics about the terms under discussion. </p><p>   \"CNH Industrial is disappointed that the parties were unable to reach an agreement,\" the company said in a written statement. \"We remain committed to reaching an agreement, and we are working to resolve this issue.\" </p><p>   \"Our members at CNH strike for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules,\" said Chuck Browning, director of the UAW's agricultural implement department. </p><p>   The strike at CNH involves about 1,100 workers at the company's plants in Racine, Wis., where its farm tractors are built, and Burlington, Iowa, where construction machinery is assembled. </p><p>   The action is the latest in a series of strikes at large U.S. companies where unions have pushed for higher wages and better benefits amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and rising corporate profits. </p><p>   In March, more than 500 California refinery workers went on strike at Chevron Corp. following a contract negotiation stalemate. Manufacturing workers at Kellogg Co. and Volvo last year went on strike, seeking higher pay. </p><p>   CNH, brands of which include CaseIH and New Holland farm machinery and Case construction equipment, is a competitor for Deere &amp; Co., where 10,000 UAW members walked off their jobs last fall for more than a month before approving a new six-year contract. </p><p>   After approving the contract in November, Deere workers received an immediate 10% raise and each worker received an $8,500 bonus. Additional 5% pay raises will be provided to Deere workers in two other years, and lump-sum bonuses amounting to 3% of workers' annual pay will be awarded in the three other years. </p><p>   The auto workers union's strike against CNH is the first at the company since late 2004, the company said. </p><p></p>",
