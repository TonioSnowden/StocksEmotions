  "title": "World News:  U.S. Crude Oil Falls  Below $80 a Barrel  ----  By David Uberti",
  "text": "<p>   A darkening economic outlook dragged U.S. oil prices on Monday to their first close below $80 since September. </p><p>   U.S. crude has fallen for four consecutive sessions, extending a recent selloff fueled by a surge in Covid-19 cases in China. The outbreak has tested Beijing's relaxation of pandemic controls, threatening to stymie economic activity along with demand for oil and petroleum products such as diesel. </p><p>   At the same time, investors expect ongoing interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve -- potentially sending the U.S. into a recession -- despite data suggesting that inflation is beginning to weaken from 40-year highs. Those factors have weighed on prices, analysts say, even as Washington is set to end its release of strategic petroleum reserves -- a move Wall Street expects to support oil. </p><p>   \"The Fed and the Chinese have both thrown cold water on those optimistic hopes,\" said Robert Yawger, executive director for energy futures at Mizuho Securities. \"For inflation, this is a good thing.\" </p><p>   Highlighting the market anxieties, contracts to deliver West Texas Intermediate crude next month fell near their lowest levels of the year Monday morning -- as low as $75.08 a barrel -- after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its market allies were considering a production increase at their December meeting. An output increase would help offset potential losses of Russian supplies as the Kremlin responds to a growing web of Western energy sanctions set to expand next month. </p><p>   After Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman denied the report and said a production cut was possible instead, WTI recovered to finish down 0.4% on the day, at $79.73 a barrel, its lowest close since Sept. 30. The U.S. benchmark is down 14% since Nov. 4. </p><p>   WTI's retreat dragged oil prices back below where they were before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. Economic fallout from the conflict helped push up the cost for products such as diesel and gasoline, providing a windfall to energy producers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. and their investors. The S&amp;P 500 energy sector has added about 63% this year, even as the broader index has lost 17%. </p><p>   The recent decline in oil prices has stalled some of those gains, with the sector losing 1.4% Monday, one of the worst performances among the index's groups. Shares in Diamondback Energy Inc. fell 4%, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co. declined 2.2%. EOG Resources Inc. slipped 0.8%. </p><p>   On Friday, the price of U.S. crude delivered in December slipped below the price of a barrel delivered in January, a dynamic some commodities traders see as a warning of additional weakness ahead. Lower near-term prices encourage suppliers to store crude instead of selling it, in hopes it will fetch more later. Such pileups tend to be sticky, suggesting a surplus that could weigh on prices in the future. </p><p>   Some analysts still expect China's gradual reopening, and forthcoming tightening of supplies will boost prices in 2023. </p><p>   A rise in production by OPEC+, which has cut its forecast for oil demand, could help stem losses from Russian barrels coming off the global market. Delegates for the group are set to meet a day before the European Union is set to ban most imports of Russian crude. </p><p></p>",
