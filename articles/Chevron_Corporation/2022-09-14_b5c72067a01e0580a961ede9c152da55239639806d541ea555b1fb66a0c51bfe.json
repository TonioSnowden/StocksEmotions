  "title": "Biden Administration Awards Offshore Oil-and-Gas Leases for 1.7 Million Acres in Gulf of Mexico; Sale is mandated by the tax-and-climate spending package approved by Congress",
  "text": "<p>The top successful bidders were subsidiaries of Chevron Corp., which spent $47 million in total for the leases. Occidental Petroleum Corp. spent $39 million, and BP PLC spent $29 million, according to federal data.</p><p>The move marks a dramatic shift for the Biden administration, which has been overseeing an unprecedented slowdown in federal oil-and-gas leasing as it promotes a transition to cleaner energy.</p><p>In the first 19 months of his administration, President Biden had set a new 70-year low for federal oil-and-gas leasing, awarding just 126,228 total acres, according to a recent Wall Street Journal analysis. Including Wednesday's 1.7 million acres would still leave him far behind his recent predecessors and put him roughly on par with former presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.</p><p>That slowdown frustrated Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a pivotal vote in Congress who argued the administration should be doing more leasing to support U.S. oil companies and ensure the country's energy supplies. He pushed environmentalists in Congress to include legal language in their climate bill to mandate that this sale be revived and that the administration hold several more.</p><p>Under the new law, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration had 30 days to take this action, a deadline approaching this week.</p><p>\"The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic and transformational investment toward achieving President Biden's ambitious goals to tackle the climate crisis,\" the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which manages offshore energy leasing, said in a statement announcing the action. \"We are committed to implementing the law, including direction regarding the federal oil and gas programs.\"</p><p>Oil industry advocates on Wednesday said the move is essential to maintaining production in the Gulf, which accounts for almost 15% of U.S. crude output, according to federal data. It has been two years since the industry could lease new territory there, and if that gap had continued it might have prevented oil companies from tapping into new reservoirs to replace production lost as today's wells peter out, industry executives have said.</p><p>\"We are pleased that the Department of the Interior has finally offered the first offshore leases of this administration, but it is disappointing that it took 19 months and an act of Congress to get us to this point,\" Cole Ramsey, an executive at the American Petroleum Institute, the nation's biggest oil trade group, said in a statement.</p><p>Wednesday's action was part of 80 million acres that had originally been planned for sale by the Trump administration, and the sale went forward last yearonly after a federal judge ruled the Biden administration didn't have legal authority to hold it up. After it was completed, environmental groups sued in a separate case, and a different federal judge in Januaryinvalidated the sale, ruling that the administration failed to do a proper environmental analysis.</p><p>The Biden administration declined to appeal the decision, letting the sale get canceled. But it was revised under the tax-and-climate spending package.</p><p>Biden Administration Awards Offshore Oil-and-Gas Leases for 1.7 Million Acres in Gulf of Mexico</p>",
