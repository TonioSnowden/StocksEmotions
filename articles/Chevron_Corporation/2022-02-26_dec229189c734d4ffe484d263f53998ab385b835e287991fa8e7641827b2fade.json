  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking: Crown Jewels --- Louisiana has its king cake, France, its galette des rois. This Mardi Gras, let us eat both.",
  "text": "<p>These two desserts bookend the Carnival season between the Epiphany and Mardi Gras, and they both make a game of dessert. The feve -- originally a bean, now often a porcelain trinket -- hidden inside a galette des rois makes a winner of the lucky one to receive the slice containing it. He or she becomes king or queen for the day and gets to wear a paper crown (which typically comes with a galette des rois purchased in a bakery). The Epiphany, after all, commemorates the arrival of the biblical three kings in Bethlehem. Though Jan. 6 is the most popular date for French households to serve the galette des rois, you'll find it throughout the month of January and even up until the beginning of Lent.</p><p>Inside a king cake, a tiny plastic baby waits to determine who has the honor of providing the next celebration's king cake. And at this time of year, there is always another celebration. For Louisianans, Jan. 6 marks the day bakeries start to sell king cakes, and production will continue through the two weeks leading up to Mardi Gras, replete with balls, parties and parades, and, finally, Fat Tuesday itself -- the last chance to feast before the 40-day Lenten season, when many people swear off such indulgent treats.</p><p>Though we call both of these desserts \"cake,\" neither one is a true cake -- no layers of tender crumb, no frosting in between. A king cake is more akin to a brioche or a giant cinnamon roll shaped into a circle (the king's \"crown\"). The classic filling consists of cinnamon and sugar, though fruity fillings such as strawberry and apple are common, as is cream cheese or a combination of that and fruit. In the recipe at right, I've opted for a tangy blackberry-lemon center.</p><p>Thanks to the quality and wide availability of frozen puff pastry throughout France, you're more likely to find homemade galettes des rois there than you are home-baked king cakes in Louisiana. When I returned to France for a gap year following law school, my French roommates taught me to sketch the curved sunburst or chevron design onto the puff pastry before baking -- my favorite part.</p><p>The truth is, a home cook can easily pull off either of these recipes, and have a good time doing it, too.</p><p>---</p><p>Blackberry-Lemon King Cake</p><p>If you want to tuck the traditional plastic baby inside, do it once the cake has baked and cooled, before decorating with icing and sprinkles.</p><p>Total Time: 4 hours</p><p>Serves: 12</p><p>For the dough:</p><p>1 cup warm water</p><p>2 large eggs, at room temperature</p><p>1/3 cup granulated sugar</p><p>1 package (1/4 ounce) instant yeast</p><p>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</p><p>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</p><p>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</p><p>Grated zest of 3 lemons</p><p>Softened butter or vegetable oil, for the bowl</p><p>For the filling and topping:</p><p>2 1/2 cup fresh blackberries</p><p>1/2 cup granulated sugar</p><p>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</p><p>1 large egg</p><p>2 cups confectioner's sugar</p><p>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</p><p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p><p>3-4 tablespoons whole milk or water</p><p>1/4 cup each purple, green and yellow sugar</p><p>1. Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine warm water and 2 eggs. Add sugar, yeast, flour, salt, 5 tablespoons butter and lemon zest. Knead on low speed until ingredients come together, about 2 minutes.</p><p>2. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes more. You'll know it's ready when a single ball forms on the dough hook and it thwacks the side of the bowl as the hook moves.</p><p>3. Remove bowl from mixer and shape dough into a ball. Transfer dough ball to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover bowl with plastic or a clean damp towel and let rise until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 -2 hours.</p><p>4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use your fingers to deflate dough, then use a rubber spatula to scrape dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.</p><p>5. Prepare the blackberry-lemon filling: In a saucepan, combine blackberries, sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice. Smash blackberries and stir. Heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl, and let cool completely.</p><p>6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces and roll each piece into a rope 18 inches long. Use a rolling pin to flatten each rope to a rectangle 6-8 inches wide.</p><p>7. Smear blackberry filling on both rectangles, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Roll each rectangle lengthwise, tightly, like a jelly roll. Twist rolls around one another, then bring ends together to form an oval ring on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p><p>8. In a small bowl, beat egg. Brush egg wash all over surface of dough ring. Transfer ring to oven and bake until a deep golden-brown, 35-40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.</p><p>9. While cake is in oven, prepare vanilla glaze: Sift confectioner's sugar into a bowl. Whisk in melted butter, vanilla and milk, and continue whisking until smooth.</p><p>10. Once cake cools to room temperature, drizzle with vanilla glaze and sprinkle with purple, green and yellow sugar before serving.</p><p>-- Adapted from 'Life Is What You Bake It' by Vallery Lomas (Clarkson Potter)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
