  "title": "World News: Despite Shift, Markets Face Wait for Venezuelan Oil",
  "text": "<p>On Saturday, the Treasury Department granted Chevron a new license to operate in Venezuela following a meeting in Mexico City between the government of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and opposition groups in which the participants agreed Venezuela would spend billions of frozen funds on humanitarian aid and infrastructure in a program to be administered by the United Nations. U.S. officials had held out Chevron's return to Venezuela as a reason for the parties to begin negotiations on a timeline and framework for free elections.</p><p>The policy shift comes two years after the Trump administration clamped down on Chevron and other oil companies' activities in Venezuela as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign aimed at ousting the government led by Mr. Maduro. That policy included withdrawing recognition from Mr. Maduro and backing congressional leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.</p><p>The shift may open the door to other oil companies that had previously operated in Venezuela, as well, though the Treasury Department didn't outline how they might re-engage with the country.</p><p>Among Chevron's first tasks are to make repairs to broken equipment, stop power outages and fix problems with pipelines, rehire hundreds of workers despite an exodus of talent from Venezuela's oil industry, and deal with physical security threats including gasoline thefts, analysts said.</p><p>\"The amount of money needed to invest in Venezuela to recover the lost production is tremendous,\" said Jose Chalhoub, a political risk and oil analyst in Venezuela who previously worked in the country's oil industry.</p><p>Mr. Chalhoub estimated the investments needed to restore Venezuela's lost oil production could come to as much as $50 billion. Over the next six months or so, he said, Chevron might increase output by some 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day, too little to make any difference to the global market.</p><p>Venezuela has also struggled to get enough diluents -- liquids that ease the flow of Venezuela's viscous oil, once primarily sourced from the U.S. -- since the U.S. imposed sanctions.</p><p>Before Chevron is willing to make new investments in Venezuela, such as in new fields, it wants to collect more than $4 billion in debt from the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.</p><p>Collecting that debt could take two to three years, as PdVSA owes Chevron and other joint-venture partners their shares of more than two years of revenue from oil sales, after the 2020 U.S. sanctions barred the Venezuelan company from paying its partners. The license would allow Chevron to collect its share of dividends from its joint ventures such as Petropiar, in which Chevron is a 30% partner.</p><p>Though Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves, it could take at least a year for Chevron to bring oil production back to 200,000 barrels a day at its four joint ventures with PdVSA, analysts said.</p><p>That is a drop in the bucket compared with the amount of oil that could be impacted by Western sanctions on Russian oil. Some analysts estimate about 1.5 million barrels a day could be affected by those sanctions next year.</p><p>Venezuela's oil production has languished around 700,000 barrels a day this year, down from more than three million barrels a day in the 1990s.</p><p>Chevron's initial push back into Venezuela is unlikely to help ease oil prices soon, analysts said.</p><p>\"This isn't something that's going to happen overnight. It will add barrels over time to global supply but it will take months if not over a year,\" said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho.</p>",
