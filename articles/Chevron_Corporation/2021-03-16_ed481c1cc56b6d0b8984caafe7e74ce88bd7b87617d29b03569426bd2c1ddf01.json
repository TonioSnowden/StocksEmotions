  "text": "<p>A group of environmental NGOs have accused US oil major Chevron of “greenwashing” in a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, providing an early test of what role the regulator will play in enforcing the Biden administration's climate goals.</p> <p>Earthworks, Global Witness and Greenpeace claimed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/50947485-d526-4e6b-adb1-08bec39a2a73\">Chevron</a> misrepresents its image to the public in order to appear “climate-friendly” despite fossil fuels being at the heart of its operations. </p> <p>Activists said the complaint was the first to accuse a fossil fuel company of greenwashing under the FTC's “green guides” — regulations aimed at stopping companies making environmental claims that mislead consumers in their marketing. </p> <p>The activists groups want the FTC — the government agency tasked with protecting consumer interests — to take action against Chevron for “egregiously misleading consumers” by exaggerating its investments in clean energy.</p> <p>“The FTC must hold Chevron accountable for any misleading claims in its advertising and marketing, to ensure that corporate ‘greenwashing' does not go unchecked,” they said.</p> <p>Chevron on Tuesday dismissed the complaint to the FTC as “frivolous”. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the company said: “We are taking action to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, increase the use of renewables and offsets in support of our business and invest in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions.”</p> <p>US oil companies have sought to improve their green image under growing pressure from investors, who are increasingly prioritising environmental, social and governance issues in their mandates.</p> <p>Chevron, the second-biggest US oil company by market capitalisation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8eca359-ebc5-429b-bc02-606e3723293c\">said last week</a> that “higher returns, lower carbon” would be its guide as it pledged to increase spending on lowering carbon emissions while holding investment in oil and gas production at current levels.</p> <p>President Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38ff8eb2-6c22-47c9-8bfa-fd5df565e874\">promised</a> to make tackling climate change a core pillar. But a narrow majority in Congress will leave him dependent on regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency and FTC, to bring about change. </p> <p>“The administration has made it clear that the climate crisis and tackling the climate crisis is a key priority,” said Julie Anne Miranda-Brobeck, head of global partnerships at Global Witness. </p> <p>“This is really just a test for the new FTC [under] the new administration to see if they will actually make good on this promise to hold polluters accountable.” </p> <p>While the FTC is an independent agency, the president appoints its chairman and commissioners, who determine its direction.&#xa0;The administration is currently considering nominating <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c297564c-85fc-4235-9444-895609c06c38\">Lina Khan</a>, a prominent critic of large technology companies, as a new commissioner, according to people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The FTC confirmed they had received the complaint&#xa0;but declined to comment further.</p><p>Source: Myles McCormick in New York 2021 'Chevron accused of ‘greenwashing' in complaint lodged with FTC' FT.com 16 March.
