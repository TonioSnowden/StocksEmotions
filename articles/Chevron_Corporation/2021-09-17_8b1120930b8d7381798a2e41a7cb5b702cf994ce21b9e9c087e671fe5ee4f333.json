  "title": "U.S. News: Fed Weighs New Curbs on Senior Officials --- Warren adds to pressure on central bank to change rules after trades disclosed",
  "text": "<p>\"The controversy over asset trading by high-level Fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest,\" Ms. Warren wrote to the bank leaders. Such rules would \"send a clear and necessary message to the American people about the importance of government ethics and the integrity of Fed officials,\" she wrote.</p><p>A Fed representative on Thursday said that Chairman Jerome Powell last week directed staff to look at ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activities by senior Fed officials. \"This review will assist in identifying ways to further tighten those rules and standards,\" the representative said.</p><p>The 12 regional Fed banks are quasi-private institutions that operate under the oversight of the Federal Reserve in Washington, which is part of the government. Regional Fed leaders participate in setting monetary policy and have extensive information about the economy and financial system, as well as private knowledge of monetary-policy deliberations.</p><p>Robert Kaplan, the leader of the Dallas Fed, traded many millions of dollars in stocks and other investments, some of which were sensitive to changes in monetary policy, last year and in years across his tenure as bank president, according to documents provided by his bank.</p><p>Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, traded more modestly but nevertheless was active in markets last year, a disclosure from his bank shows. The other 10 regional Fed leaders largely refrained from such financial activity.</p><p>Messrs. Kaplan and Rosengren said last week after their trading activities became public that they would sell off their stockholdings and move the money into cash or diversified investment funds and that they wouldn't trade in stocks again while leading their respective banks.</p><p>Both officials also said their trading was in compliance with their banks' codes of conduct that prevented trading in bank stocks and put limitations on when officials can trade. The Fed bank codes were set with input from the Fed in Washington in the mid-1990s, with periodic reviews over subsequent years.</p><p>Central-bank watchers said the trading may have complied with the letter of the rules but not the spirit, and critics said it raised questions about whether they set monetary policy with the nation's interest or with their own pocketbooks in mind.</p><p>A disclosure from Mr. Kaplan showed he made multiple stock trades of over $1 million each. Mr. Kaplan, who worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for more than 20 years before leaving in 2006, traded Apple Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Amazon.com Inc., General Electric Co. and Chevron Corp. stocks, among others. He also bought and sold other investments tied to interest rates and stock futures, both of which are sensitive to changes in monetary policy.</p><p>Mr. Rosengren's trades, which were smaller, included a number of investments in real-estate-related securities. The policy maker has frequently warned about risks in the real-estate market.</p><p>In her letters to Messrs. Rosengren and Kaplan, Ms. Warren said divesting themselves of their stockholdings \"was the right move and will help reassure the public of your integrity.\" But she added it is critical that the banks' codes of conduct have enough clarity to prevent such situations in the future. She asked for a response by Oct. 15 on how the banks would implement her requested changes.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
