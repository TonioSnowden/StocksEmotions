  "text": "<p>Two things to start:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Things are looking up for producers in Canada's oil sands as the fallout from the war in Ukraine drives global energy security concerns. But can one of the dirtiest sources of crude thrive as the world clamps down on emissions? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276ecc11-15cd-45ef-8e10-5f64dcde77da\">Check out Derek's Big Read</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>Elsewhere, the disruption to global energy supplies from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only just begun. IEA boss Fatih Birol says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/078e2d50-f161-4257-8364-c80b5bfecc7f\">energy rationing</a> may be on the cards in Europe this winter.</p></li> </ul> <p>Welcome back to Energy Source. </p> <p>I spent some time this week in natural gas country in south-west Pennsylvania. EQT, the US's biggest producer, was in sales mode as it ferried foreign diplomats around Greene County, pitching American exports as the ideal replacement to Russian gas.</p> <p>Toby Rice, EQT's chief executive, was ebullient as he touted the industry's efforts to clean up its dirty image — something that just 18 months ago was sinking LNG deals.</p> <p>Keep an eye on FT.com in the coming days for more on the natural gas sales drive. Today we stick with that theme — and a confluence of events yesterday that damaged the brand. </p> <p>In Data Drill, Amanda charts the rebound in ExxonMobil's share price, which scaled new heights yesterday. Remember in October 2020 when its market value <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a70458-d4d1-4a6e-aca6-1d5670bade11\">slipped below</a> that of wind and solar generator NextEra Energy? Many commentators said at the time that it a watershed moment for an industry in decline.</p> <p>Rumours of its demise, to butcher a Mark Twain quote, were greatly exaggerated. </p> <p>As ever, thanks for reading. </p> <p>Myles </p> <h1>A bad day for the US natural gas brand</h1> <p>In the marketing game, “brand positioning” is crucial. </p> <p>And yesterday was a bad day for the brand positioning of the US natural gas industry.</p> <p>The sector has become increasingly aware of its perception abroad as it gears up for an export boom that would see it send a flotilla of tankers carrying fuel to the far ends of the earth — coming to the rescue of a global market scrambling for an alternative to Russian gas. </p> <p>But a trio of events over the past 24 hours were not a good look for gas. </p> <p>First came a <a href=\"https://science.house.gov/news/press-releases/science-committee-majority-staff-report-finds-oil-and-gas-sector-fails-to-quantify-and-address-super-emitting-methane-leaks\">congressional report</a> accusing the industry of under-reporting and failing to address methane leaks.</p> <p>Then came an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d89b4b3d-1503-4d6f-b83a-9a17b0ec318f?\">explosion</a> at a south Texas liquefied natural gas terminal that put almost a fifth of US capacity out of action.</p> <p>Finally, came cutting comments from John Kerry, America's climate diplomat-in-chief, who in offhand remarks blasted the “vested interests” that he said were “trying to exploit” the situation in Ukraine by embedding more export infrastructure.</p> <p>For an industry that has made strides in its push to dispel some of its negative associations, all of these will grate. </p> <p>It was not long ago that the pollution-riddled image of America's natural gas sector was literally costing it billions of dollars. </p> <p>In late 2020, Engie, the French utility, scuppered a $7bn deal with Texas's NextDecade over concerns about the sector's methane footprint.</p> <p>Keen to dispel that notion, the sector has been proactive in supporting methane regulations — welcoming the Biden administration's decision to reinstate rules on leak monitoring that had been thrown out by Donald Trump. Most big companies have supported a further tightening of the regulations. </p> <p>Yesterday's <a href=\"https://science.house.gov/hearings/detecting-and-quantifying-methane-emissions-from-the-oil-and-gas-sector\">report</a>, compiled by Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology flew in the face of that effort. It suggested methane emissions from oil and gas operations were likely “significantly higher than official data reported to [the] EPA would indicate”.</p> <p>“The oil and gas sector has a long way to go to rein in methane leaks,” said chair Eddie Bernice Johnson, as she accused the sector of failing to make the most of the latest leak detection and repair technologies.</p> <p>It was not entirely clear at the time of writing what was behind the explosion at Freeport LNG's export terminal, south of Houston. No one was hurt and the company said it had the issue under control. But it conceded last night that it had been forced to shut its liquefaction facility and it would remain out of action for “a minimum of three weeks”.</p> <p>What was clear was that campaigners were using the incident as evidence that facilities are being run too hard for the sake of maximising profits. (Though the company insisted it operates to the highest standards of safety.)</p> <p>“We shouldn't have to live in fear just so gas executives like [Freeport chief executive] Michael Smith can get rich,” said Melanie Oldham, a Freeport resident and environmental campaigner. </p> <p>The market was riled, with Henry hub gas prices slumping more than 12 per cent. Freeport's three trains have capacity to process about 2.1bn cubic feet a day of natural gas — 17 per cent of US liquefaction capacity and 2 per cent of US gas production. </p> <p>But it was Kerry's comments — seemingly made off the cuff as he played for time at the end of remarks on methane at the Summit of the Americas — that will probably sting the industry most. </p> <p>Oil and gas executives have been working closely with the administration to promote exports as part of the drive to wean Europe off Russian exports. Joe Biden boasted of the US's “strong domestic industry” as he announced a deal last month with Brussels that would see Europe work to add 50bn cubic metres a year of LNG by 2030 (or about 4.8bn cu ft/d). </p> <p>That made the comments by his climate envoy all the more bizarre. </p> <p>“There are vested interests right now trying to exploit Ukraine,” he said, alluding to efforts to expand “infrastructure”.&#xa0;“We cannot allow that to happen.” <em>(Myles McCormick)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>ExxonMobil's stock is performing better than ever. The oil supermajor's share price surpassed $105 yesterday — up 66 per cent since January and an all-time record. </p> <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic recovery have fuelled Exxon's rally. West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, rose to its highest level since March this week, reaching $122 a barrel.</p> <p>The rest of Big Oil is also cashing in on surging crude prices. Chevron shares are up 50 per cent since January. The S&amp;P 500 Energy index is up 60 per cent, outperforming the rest of the stock market. </p> <p>This stellar performance marks a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1297fac-946a-487b-a18f-7c49c154f224\">sharp reversal</a> from the pandemic when crude prices plummeted and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a70458-d4d1-4a6e-aca6-1d5670bade11\">cast uncertainty</a> over the future of Big Oil.
