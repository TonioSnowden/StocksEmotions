  "title": "Chevron Foe Steven Donziger Faces Sentencing in Contempt Case; Disbarred attorney was convicted of intentionally violating court orders during his legal battle against the oil company over pollution in the Ecuadorean rainforest",
  "text": "<p>The Harvard Law School grad has been stripped of his ability to practice law and largely confined to his Manhattan apartment for more than two years, wearing an ankle bracelet.</p><p>Judge Preska has said the maximum sentence she will consider for the contempt of court conviction is six months in prison.</p><p>In her July ruling, which came after a five-day trial, Judge Preska concluded that \"at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.\"</p><p>Mr. Donziger in 1993 first accused Texaco Inc. of polluting a swath of previously pristine rainforest, arguing in a New York lawsuit that the company's drilling activities ruined the quality of life for local indigenous communities. Chevron later acquired Texaco and assumed its legal defense.</p><p>The company pushed back, successfully moving the dispute to Ecuador, where a protracted trial ended in a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. The win, however, was fleeting, with Chevron accusing Mr. Donziger and his allies of manipulating the proceeding even before the final judgment was entered.</p><p>That dispute brought the battle back to the U.S., where Chevron won a civil racketeering lawsuit codifying its theory that the Ecuadorean judgment was the product of ghostwriting and other inappropriate acts. That 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan essentially blocked Mr. Donziger from trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment or from ever profiting from the award.</p><p>Chevron has denied any culpability for lasting oil damage in the jungle, saying the company resolved the issue with Ecuador decades ago. It hasn't paid any of the $9.5 billion award.</p><p>Chevron repeatedly flagged to Judge Kaplan when its lawyers believed Mr. Donziger was disobeying his 2014 ruling, including once when he hired a life coach in exchange for a sliver of his share in the Ecuadorean judgment.</p><p>In 2019 Judge Kaplan brought criminal contempt charges and referred the matter to Judge Preska for trial. In an unusual move, the case is being prosecuted by a private lawyer because the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York declined to pursue it.</p><p>That private prosecutor, New York lawyer Rita Glavin, said in a recent court filing that she had no specific recommendation on how to sentence Mr. Donziger.</p><p>Ms. Glavin told the judge she should consider that \"Mr. Donziger's disobedience was deliberate and repeated. He has expressed no remorse for his conduct. To this day, Mr. Donziger has not produced documents he was ordered to produce.\"</p><p>Ms. Glavin also encouraged the court to \"consider a sentence to deter those who would seek to undermine the rule of law in this way in the future.\"</p><p>An attorney for Mr. Donziger, Ronald Kuby, sees it differently.</p><p>\"Mr. Donziger's life has been lived largely in selfless service to those who are poor and oppressed,\" he wrote in a presentencing memo, concluding that, \"Mr. Donziger has been punished enough.\"</p><p>Mr. Donziger continues to attract a cadre of devoted supporters, 45 of whom wrote letters vouching for his character in an effort to persuade Judge Preska to sentence him to the time he has already served in home confinement. The letters came from law-school classmates, human-rights lawyers, environmental nonprofit leaders, and even a judicial official who had recommended that Mr. Donziger be able to keep his law license.</p><p>Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Chevron Foe Steven Donziger Faces Sentencing in Contempt Case</p>",
