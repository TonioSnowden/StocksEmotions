  "title": "Stocks Rise as Investors Parse More Earnings; Chevron and Caterpillar report results at end of market's roller-coaster week",
  "text": "<p>Chevron reported its most profitable year since 2014 and said it would raise capital expenditures by 20% to $15 billion this year. Shares fell 1.6% in premarket trading. Caterpillar edged down after the equipment maker reported a surge in costs that offset a jump in revenue.</p><p>Apple shares rose 4.1% ahead of the bell after the biggest U.S. company by market capitalization posted record revenue and profits. Shares of brokerage Robinhood Markets, which reported a quarterly loss of $423 million, dropped 14% premarket.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday added to expectations that the central bank will start a series of interest-rate increases in March. His words pushed up yields on short-term government bonds, boosted the dollar and renewed the stock-market turbulence.</p><p>\"Cheap money is like a comfort blanket for investors and for markets,\" said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank. \"Almost inevitably, you start to withdraw some of that cheap money and you're going to have more volatility in the markets.\"</p><p>The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against other major currencies, rose 0.1% Friday. Up 1.8% for the week, it was on course for its biggest gain since June.</p><p>Government-bond prices fell, pushing up yields. The yield on interest-rate sensitive two-year Treasury notes ticked up to 1.216% from 1.190% Thursday and 0.993% at the end of last week. Yields on 10-year notes haven't risen as fast, which some analysts interpret as a sign investors think interest-rate rises by the Fed will squelch economic growth. They stood at 1.842% Friday, up from 1.747% a week ago.</p><p>Stocks have been choppy despite another solid round of earnings. Almost a third of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 have reported fourth-quarter results, and 78% of them have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Visa rose 4.3% premarket after beating analysts' forecasts for profits and sales. Mondelez International slipped 2.2%. The food company said higher prices for its snacks weren't enough to make up for increased ingredient and transportation costs.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise as Investors Parse More Earnings</p>",
