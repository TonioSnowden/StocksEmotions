Chevron CVX rose 2.5%, while Exxon XOM gained 3%.</p><p>Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said economic growth fears that have triggered the pullback in commodity prices has inspired a shift in thinking about the Federal Reserve. Investors are increasingly betting that the central bank won't need to be as aggressive with its interest rate hikes.</p><p>\"Markets right now are betting that the Fed is going to break and follow the economy, not necessarily inflation,\" Nolte said.</p><p>Investors will be hoping that the battering delivered to stocks this year means that there is opportunity for the market to be pleasantly surprised when the U.S. second quarter earnings reporting season gets into full swing next week.</p><p>Some analysts are wary though.</p><p>\"Stocks could see a second phase of bear market driven by earnings weakness. A trough is likely to come only when unemployment rates are close to peaking, which could be a year or so from now, \" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management.</p><p>\"Broad diversification, active tactical asset allocation and disciplined downside risk management will be key to navigate the bumpy road ahead,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, equity investors appear to have decided that the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting, released on Wednesday, contained little to be concerned about.</p><p>Attention will now turn to a speech on Thursday from St Louis Fed president James Bullard, and Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for fresh clues to the Fed's policy trajectory. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 4 basis points at 2.950%.</p><p>Data released Thursday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless insurance increasedby 4,000 last week, while the number of ongoing claims increased by 51,000. Investors are now looking ahead to Friday's payrolls report for the month of June.
