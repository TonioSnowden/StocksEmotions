  "title": "Business News:  Chevron CEO  Sees Russian Oil  Output Falling  ----  By Collin Eaton",
  "text": "<p>   Russia is still finding a home for much of its oil despite expanding sanctions, but its production likely will diminish following the departure of Western oil companies, Chevron Corp. Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. </p><p>   In a meeting with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors last week, Mr. Wirth noted many countries continued to buy crude from Russia, one of the top oil producers along with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. </p><p>   But he said that it would be difficult for Russia to overcome the loss of Western technology and capital, noting that other once-large oil producers have seen output fall after sanctions and the pullout of international oil companies. </p><p>   \"If you look at Iran and Venezuela, two other examples of large producers that have come under sanctions and have been pretty well cut off from the same kinds of investments and technology, their productive capacity degrades over time,\" Mr. Wirth said. </p><p>   After decades of carving out footholds in Russia's oil business, BP PLC, Shell PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. said they would exit their operations in the country after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February. A few weeks later, oil-field services giants Halliburton Co., Baker Hughes Co. and Schlumberger Ltd., which provide equipment and workers needed to extract oil, all said they would suspend new investments in Russia. </p><p>   Chevron didn't have any sizable operations in Russia and was the least affected major oil company. </p><p>   The European Union is planning to move forward with a partial embargo of Russian oil, and many Western refiners have stopped buying supplies from Russia. Even so, Mr. Wirth said Russian energy products are still finding willing buyers around the world at discounted prices, and so oil-market participants for now are responding to the prospect of reduced supply, rather than a large drop in oil production. Russian oil is still flowing as some shippers and refiners hide its origins. </p><p>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers aligned with it last week agreed to an increase in production later this summer that was larger than anticipated, which could lead Saudi Arabia to boost output. </p><p>   President Biden had earlier called for OPEC to increase production in response to rising energy prices, but the group had rebuffed his requests. The new commitments were seen as a move that could pave the way for Mr. Biden to visit Saudi Arabia later this month, as the U.S. and the kingdom seek to reset what has recently been a strained relationship. </p><p>   Mr. Wirth said if Mr. Biden wanted to see global oil supplies rise, Saudi Arabia was among the very few producers with spare capacity to bring more crude to market quickly. </p><p>   \"This is the role Saudi has historically played,\" Mr. Wirth said. \"In the context of the broader relationship and whatever discussions may be ongoing, if that can lead to more supply into the market, that's a positive outcome for world energy markets.\" </p><p></p>",
