  "title": "ExxonMobil flags highest quarterly profit since boom year of 2008",
  "text": "<p>ExxonMobil has estimated quarterly profits that could be the highest in more than a decade after Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove oil and natural gas prices sharply higher. </p> <p>The US energy supermajor said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its first-quarter profits could total as much as $11bn, which would we be the most since 2008, when crude oil prices soared to a record high of nearly $150 a barrel. </p> <p>Brent crude prices have surpassed $100 a barrel this year as western sanctions placed on Russia in punishment for its<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\"> attack on Ukraine</a> have threatened to exacerbate shortfalls in oil supplies. Brent was trading at about $108 a barrel on Monday.</p> <p>Exxon's bumper earnings preview comes two days before Darren Woods, chief executive, is scheduled to appear before a committee of the US House of Representatives to address high petrol prices, alongside other executives from oil companies including Chevron, BP and Shell. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/0fb8f46d-03f9-473a-b9ef-ad3d84e6945e\">Exxon</a> said that profits in its upstream oil and gas production division could be as much as $8.3bn in the first quarter of the year, $2.2bn higher than the fourth quarter and the highest for any quarter since 2017. </p> <p>While high oil and gas prices will boost earnings of its production business, Exxon said that overall earnings could be weighed down by as much as $700mn related to price hedges in its fuels business and weaker profit margins in its chemicals unit. The company will issue a final earnings report on April 29.</p> <p>The company's shares were down about 1 per cent on Monday, though they are up about 30 per cent so far this year as oil stocks have rallied alongside the price of crude.</p> <p>Exxon last month announced it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76db0e18-7c7e-4b96-9ee5-81dcfca18f34\">exit </a>the huge Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in eastern Russia in response to the Ukraine invasion. Monday's regulatory filing said Exxon could be forced to write down up to $4bn for the project, while the company was “proceeding with efforts to discontinue operations” at the project. </p> <p>Separately, a consortium led by Exxon said it had taken a final investment decision to develop a $10bn oil-producing project in waters off Guyana, which it says will produce a total of 250,000 barrels a day when it starts up in 2025. </p> <p>The company is ploughing billions of dollars into the area after a number of large discoveries in the South American country that could ultimately pump more than 1mn b/d, more than the UK currently produces.</p><p>Source: Justin Jacobs in Houston 2022 'ExxonMobil flags highest quarterly profit since boom year of 2008' FT.com 4 April.
