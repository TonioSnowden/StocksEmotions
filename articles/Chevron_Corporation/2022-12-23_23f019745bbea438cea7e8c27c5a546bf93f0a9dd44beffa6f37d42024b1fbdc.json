Over the 12 months through November, the yearly rate of inflation slowed to 5.5%, from 6.1% in the prior month.</p><p>See: High U.S. inflation is on the wane, PCE price gauge shows</p><p>See also: Consumer spending barely rose at start of holiday shopping season</p><p>Other economic data were released, including durable-goods orders for November, which sank 2.1%.</p><p>While investors were likely pleased to see inflation continue to slow, none of the economic data released this week would justify the Federal Reserve pivoting back toward cutting interest rates any time soon, said Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management.</p><p>\"The PCE certainly came down a little bit, but it's nowhere near where the Fed would like it to be,\" Nolte said.</p><p>Because of this, market strategists believe stocks will remain under pressure until the Fed signals that interest-rate cuts are imminent.</p><p>Weak durable goods orders and other data released this week have stoked concerns about the slowing economy as traders debate whether signs of a slowing economy might inspire the Fed to cut interest rates earlier than investors presently expect.</p><p>\"While recession worries are certainly warranted, I think the market cares more about the Fed and the potential for more interest hikes. Therefore, I'm in the camp that bad economic news might be good for stocks since it should slow the Fed down,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading.</p><p>The final University of Michiganconsumer sentiment reading for Decemberimproved to 59.7, compared with the initial reading of 59.1.
