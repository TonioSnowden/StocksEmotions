That was a great reversal from previous oil cycles and underscored just how focused oil producers' management teams have been on not cutting out their own legs from under them by flooding the market and killing their own profits.</p><p>Here's a 10-year chart showing the movement of West Texas Intermediate crude oil CL.1 prices, based on continuous front-month contract prices compiled by FactSet:</p><p>Leaving aside the temporary price crash during the early phase of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when a collapse in demand led to the industry running out of storage space, you should turn your attention to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price action in 2014, 2015 and 2016. It turns out that the U.S. shale industry's success led to its own turmoil, as prices collapsed to levels that meant some producers were losing money on every barrel of oil they pumped.</p><p>The domestic producers are now being very careful not to repeat their overproduction mistake.</p><p>And that begs the question: Can we estimate a magic number for WTI at which the U.S. producers will not only remain profitable but will be able to continue raising dividends and buying back shares?</p><p>Simon Wong of Gabelli went with a conservative estimate during an interview. Existing shale wells might be operated for as little as $10 to $20 a barrel, he said, but it is the nature of shale extraction that new wells must be brought online continually to maintain supply. Wong estimated that the price of WTI would need to average $55 a barrel to break even on a new well.</p><p>Taking that further, he said a conservative estimate for shale U.S. producers to break even would be $65 a barrel.</p><p>\"Companies have built their cost structures on $60 oil. I still think at $80 they will generate plenty of free cash flow,\" he said, pointing to continuing share buybacks and dividend increases at that level.</p><p>He added: \"A year ago we were happy when oil was $75.\"</p><p>Don't miss: Dividend yields on preferred stocks have soared.
