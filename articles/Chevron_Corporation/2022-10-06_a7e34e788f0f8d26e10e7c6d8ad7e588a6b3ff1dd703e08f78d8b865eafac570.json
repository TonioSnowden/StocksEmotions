  "title": "U.S., Venezuela Prepare Deal To Loosen Sanctions on Oil",
  "text": "<p>U.S. officials said details are still under discussion and cautioned the deal could fall through, since it is contingent on Mr. Maduro's aides resuming talks with the opposition in good faith.</p><p>\"There are no plans to change our sanctions policy without constructive steps from the Maduro regime,\" said Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the National Security Council.</p><p>If the deal goes through and Chevron and U.S. oil service companies are allowed to work in Venezuela again, it would put only a limited amount of new oil on the world market in the short term.</p><p>Venezuela was once a major oil producer, pumping more than 3.2 million barrels a day in the 1990s, but the state-run industry has collapsed over the past decade because of underinvestment, corruption and mismanagement. Sanctions leveled by the Trump administration further dented production and forced Western companies out of the country.</p><p>Any shift in U.S. policy that brings back Western oil companies would send a psychological signal to the market that more supply is on the way, the people said. Word of a possible U.S. rapprochement with Venezuela is emerging just as OPEC+ countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to slash production in response to sagging oil prices, angering the Biden administration.</p><p>But engaging Venezuela, which sits atop some of the world's largest oil reserves, could serve as a longer-term strategy for the U.S. and European countries scrambling to secure new energy sources as Russia's war in Ukraine drags on and upends commodities markets, said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University.</p><p>\"If [oil] prices come down, this all could change,\" Mr. Monaldi said, \"but for now, this is their obsession.\"</p><p>The U.S.-Venezuela proposed agreement, the terms of which are expected to be shored up later this month, is the latest sign that Washington is willing to wind down a pressure campaign against the Maduro government that it inherited from the Trump administration.</p><p>There are potential pitfalls. The proposal is stoking fury among some of the regime's most strident foes, who said the strategy would allow Mr. Maduro to maintain his authoritarian grip on the country with few concessions. On the other hand, it could be unpopular among some in the Maduro administration.</p><p>\"Inside the regime, you have hard-liners who are very critical of Maduro's neoliberal turn,\" said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela program at the Washington Office on Latin America. \"And within the opposition, you have players who are very interested in doing everything possible to continue the interim government.\"</p><p>Some Venezuelan opposition leaders said fresh cash could embolden Mr. Maduro, whose government in recent years has circumvented U.S. sanctions by selling its heavy crude oil to China and other Asian buyers at steep discounts.</p><p>Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr didn't comment on the proposed deal, but said that in Venezuela, \"we have dedicated investments and a large workforce who are dependent on our presence.\" He said the company is in compliance with the current sanctions framework.</p><p>Ali Moshiri, a former Chevron executive who oversaw the expansion of the company's operations in Latin America and worked closely with Venezuelan officials, said the Biden administration's shift appears to reflect political pressure that has come with rising energy prices and tight global supplies.</p><p>\"It makes a lot of sense that the Biden administration relaxes some of the sanctions toward Venezuela, to allow multiple resources to help us lower energy prices,\" said Mr. Moshiri, who estimated the country could reach 1.5 million barrels a day of output in two years if Chevron and other companies can work freely.</p><p>Talks between officials from the U.S. and Venezuela have been quietly under way since at least March, but gained momentum when Venezuela on Saturday released six U.S. citizens and one U.S. permanent resident who had been jailed in that country. In exchange, the U.S. released two men -- nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores -- who had been convicted of drug trafficking.</p><p>A U.S. official said the swap created some \"new opportunities\" between the two sides that didn't exist a week ago.</p><p>Wall Street firms and U.S. investors had for months also been pressing the Biden administration to lift sanctions to recover billions of dollars in debt and strike business deals with Caracas. The toughest sanctions came in 2019, when the U.S. and dozens of its allies declared opposition leader Juan Guaido was Venezuela's legitimate president. His movement failed to oust Mr. Maduro, and most countries now openly deal with the Maduro government.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Guaido didn't respond to questions seeking comment. The opposition leader has said he opposes easing pressure on Mr. Maduro.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions against Venezuela, is preparing to issue one or more licenses for Chevron to run its four existing joint venture oil projects with the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Chevron's agreement with Venezuela gives it full operational control and runs about 1,000 pages, people familiar with the document said.</p><p>With Chevron in charge of the projects, and the U.S. clearing the export of oil, Venezuela could regain the relevance in the oil market that it enjoyed in the early 2000s. The country now exports about 450,000 barrels a day and could double it in a matter of months, said people who are familiar with Venezuela's oil industry and are bullish about its prospects.</p><p>The Treasury and State departments didn't reply to requests to comment. Venezuela's state oil company and Information Ministry didn't respond to emails seeking comment.</p><p>---</p><p>Collin Eaton and Andrew Scurria contributed to this article.</p>",
