  "text": "<p>Whirlpool Corp.</p><p>Demand for Whirlpool's appliances is draining. The refrigerator and dishwasher maker said its first-quarter sales fell more than 8% compared with the same period last year as shoppers buy fewer long-lasting home goods such as office chairs and appliances when compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. The company plans to boost prices further and increase production as it battles high inflation, supply-chain issues and the fallout from the Russian attack on Ukraine, which hurt demand in Europe and drove up its costs in the region. Whirlpool shares gained 4.6% Tuesday.</p><p>Twitter Inc.</p><p>It's official: Twitter likes Elon Musk. The social-media company on Monday accepted the Tesla chief executive's bid to take over the company that stands to become one of the biggest acquisitions of a tech firm. The $44 billion deal marks a change of heart at Twitter, where many executives and board members initially opposed Mr. Musk's approach. The agreement would give the world's richest man control over the influential social-media platform where he is also one of its most powerful users. Mr. Musk said after the deal was announced that he wants to make Twitter a better user experience, in part by adding new features and fighting spam. Twitter shares rose 5.7% Monday.</p><p>Ford Motor Co.</p><p>Ford is spinning its wheels. The auto maker posted a $3.1 billion first-quarter loss, a reversal largely driven by a steep loss in valuation of its stake in electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive Inc. Ford faces continued challenges securing enough auto parts to keep assembly lines fully running. The continuing semiconductor shortage stifled Ford's factory output, resulting in downtime at several plants during the quarter and hindering efforts to restock lots with enough vehicles to satisfy demand. The auto industry's outlook also grew increasingly uncertain during the quarter, due to the war in Ukraine and pandemic-related restrictions in China. Ford shares lost 1.6% Thursday.</p><p>Mattel Inc.</p><p>Mattel is toying with a buyout. The Barbie maker has held talks with private-equity firms about a potential sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, just a few months after the company declared its corporate turnaround complete. The private-equity firms circling the company include Apollo Global Management Inc. and L Catterton. The talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal. The next day Mattel reported sales grew 19% to more than $1 billion in the latest period on strong demand for toys and improvements in its supply chain, and Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said the company remains focused on reducing debt and potential deal making. Mattel shares gained 11% Wednesday.</p><p>Robinhood Markets Inc.</p><p>Robinhood signed up millions of investors during the pandemic, but now it's struggling to keep them. The online brokerage on Thursday reported that its monthly active user count fell 10% to 15.9 million in March, from 17.7 million in the same month of 2021. Its quarterly revenue dropped 43% from the same period last year, marking the company's fifth consecutive quarterly drop, and on Wednesday the company said it would lay off 9% of its full-time staff. Robinhood has added a slew of new products to build up its user base and bring in new revenue streams, including a digital wallet and the ability to trade more cryptocurrencies. Robinhood shares declined 2.8% Friday.</p><p>Exxon Mobil Corp.</p><p>Big Oil is showering investors with cash. Exxon Mobil on Friday said it collected $5.5 billion in first-quarter profit and would triple its share repurchases, as big energy companies continue to reap the rewards of high commodity prices. Meanwhile, Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, on Friday said it made $6.3 billion in quarterly profit, up from about $1.4 billion in the same period last year. The company has paid out billions of dollars to investors so far this year. Oil and gas prices have surged since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and as global demand outpaces supply growth. Exxon shares fell 2.2% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon, Ford, Twitter: Stocks That Defined the Week: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
