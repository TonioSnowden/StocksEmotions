His approval rating has slumped in recent weeks, with an increasing share of Americans taking a dim view of his handling of the economy.</p> <p>The Biden administration is considering releasing crude oil from a federal strategic stockpile in a bid to drive down petrol prices and has repeatedly called on Saudi Arabia, Russia and other Opec+ oil countries to lift crude production.</p> <p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil lobby group, said Biden's letter was a “distraction from the fundamental market shift taking place” and blamed the administration for restricting US oil supplies.</p> <p>The AAA motoring group estimates a gallon of gasoline has risen 60 per cent in the past year to an average of about $3.41 a gallon.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Read more:</strong> The American oil industry is struggling to recover from last year's price crash and respond to higher prices as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29743712-e42c-467e-8dbb-94a4b8e0f602\">this report</a> from Houston correspondent Justin Jacobs explains.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>What do you think of Joe Biden's handling of the economy?

Some of the ideas we cover are “out there”, but all of them are really thought-provoking and help us make sense of the new workplace.</p> <p><strong>What else are you listening to right now?&#xa0;<br></strong>My longest pod-lationship is with the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0yKJ1ARAU7Jx8AyAP1iE04\">Slate Culture Gabfest</a> — I've been listening for probably 10 or 12 years now. It's got a blend of regular presenters who feel like friends, interesting guests and ahead-of-the-curve topics for discussion. My new Saturday morning listen, alongside my longstanding relationship with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/72J3TnV5JP4TCZyIhhBToC\">Payne's Politics</a>, a UK politics show hosted by my FT colleague Sebastian Payne, is the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7q07gI03BxaXirI19PxUGi\">FT Weekend</a> podcast. It's got a perfect, leisurely mix of guests and topics — and it's already introduced me to new books, ideas and places. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What's your experience been like returning to the office after the pandemic?<br></strong>I never really left the office. I live in central London so it's an easy commute. I have been coming in for a couple of days every week except during the months when we were locked down in our homes. My new workplace concern is perhaps a niche one: I've got so used to being in a quiet office that it's going to be really hard to adjust to the noise level and distraction once it's full again.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Joe Biden vs big oil' FT.com 18 November.
