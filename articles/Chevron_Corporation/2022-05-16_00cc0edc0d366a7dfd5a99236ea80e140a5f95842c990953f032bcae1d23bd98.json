  "text": "<p>The head of a North Sea energy company that is betting on another 30 years of oil and gas production in the UK has appealed for “fiscal stability” as it looks to spend $3bn reviving projects including the contentious Cambo oilfield.</p> <p>Gilad Myerson, executive chair of Ithaca Energy, argued oil and gas production is a “very cyclical industry” where profits can be “very high but at times the losses could be very, very significant”.</p> <p>“What we need more than anything is fiscal stability,” Myerson told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“These are very, very significant investments and we'd take [on] a lot of debt. We wouldn't want to find ourselves in a situation where we take debt and we cannot pay back the debt because of changes to tax regimes.”</p> <p>Ministers have threatened oil and gas producers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41852bd1-4f24-4dce-a914-afd7f0bb0bda\">with a windfall tax</a> if they do not produce satisfactory plans showing how they will reinvest profits in the UK. </p> <p>However, producers argue a levy would harm investment in one of the world's most mature oil and gas regions at a time when the UK needs to produce as much energy domestically as possible to reduce reliance on imports, including from Russia.</p> <p>Ithaca, previously listed in Toronto and London, was acquired by Tel Aviv-listed Delek in 2017. It has since been on an acquisition spree in the North Sea to form one of the country's largest independent oil and gas groups. </p> <p>Myerson is hoping to capitalise on what he thinks is a change in mood towards pure oil and gas companies to return to the public markets, although he is keeping the potential timing of an IPO close to his chest. In recent years, undiversified oil and gas companies have struggled as investors adopted stricter environment and social policies. </p> <p>“We . . . are hearing from generalist investors who feel the pendulum has swung too far [against oil and gas],” Myerson said, although he added the company had so far only held informal discussions with investors.</p> <p>Ithaca's acquisitions have included a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1f25a34-82a6-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b\">$2bn swoop</a> on Chevron's North Sea operations in 2019 and earlier this year a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26c32896-3a2e-4757-8705-4c76e74855ba\">$1.5bn </a>deal for Siccar Point Energy, the private equity-backed energy company that hit the headlines in 2021 after it applied to UK regulators to develop Cambo, a large oilfield west of the Shetland Islands in which it held a 70 per cent stake.</p> <p>Cambo became a focal point for the debate over whether the UK should pursue new fossil fuels projects when the country has a legally-binding 2050 “net zero” emissions target. It was<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8dd5e6d2-602a-4fcc-8cc2-2db6845b500d\"> paused last year </a>when minority partner Shell said the economic case for Cambo was “not strong enough”.</p> <p>Due to close in June, the Siccar Point acquisition also hands Ithaca a 20 per cent stake in Rosebank, another significant undeveloped oilfield north-west of the Shetlands. Ithaca anticipates spending “easily above $3bn” across both projects and hopes to make a final decision with its partners next year.</p> <p>Following the Siccar Point deal Ithaca will control reserves that would allow it to continue producing hydrocarbons “deep into the 2050s”, which is likely to make it a fresh target for climate groups opposed to large new developments that would prolong their use.</p> <p>“We believe that industry and humanity needs oil and gas at least for the next 10-20 years as part of the energy transition,” Myerson said.<br><br>Shell, Siccar Point's junior partner in Cambo, said in December it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdbd448d-a3c6-4d53-b13a-d4be50a2b280\">withdraw for economic reasons. </a>The company has insisted its position on Cambo has yet to change, although the BBC reported in March that it was reconsidering its stance. Myerson said it was “too early to tell” what the future ownership structure of Cambo might be.</p> <p>“We have reached out to different partners, and obviously to Shell, to understand their view and will be working with them after we close the [Siccar Point] deal,” he said.</p><p>Source: Nathalie Thomas, Energy Correspondent 2022 'North Sea producer seeks ‘fiscal stability' amid windfall tax calls' FT.com 16 May.
