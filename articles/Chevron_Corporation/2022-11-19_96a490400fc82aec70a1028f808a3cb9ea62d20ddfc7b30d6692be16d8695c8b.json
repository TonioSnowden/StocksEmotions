  "title": "Earthquake in Top Texas Oil Region Spurs Calls for New Fracking Rules; Powerful temblor is latest to hit Permian basin, where scientists link wastewater injection to more seismic activity",
  "text": "<p>The temblor adds pressure to the state's oil-and-gas regulators to impose stricter rules on frackers pumping wastewater underground to stymie the Permian basin's dangerous new seismic activity, analysts and executives said. It could also prompt a review of management practices and affect oil operations, they said.</p><p>The quake was one of thousands to shake the oil-rich Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico in recent years. Scientists have linked the increase in seismic activity to shale companies pumping billions of gallons of wastewater—a byproduct of oil-and-gas production—down shallow and deep disposal wells. Injections modify the pressure underground and can cause faults to slip and create earthquakes.</p><p>The temblor was unlikely to have an immediate impact on oil-and-gas production in the area, according to analysts. But some executives said it should be a wake-up call for regulators and companies to figure out how to deal with the vast volumes of water that surface daily in the oil patch.</p><p>Kirk Edwards, an oil executive and former chairman of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, said he felt this week's earthquake at his office in Midland, Texas, about a three-hour drive away from the site of the temblor. \"We cannot keep cramming a tremendous amount of water through a disposal well at one site,\" Mr. Edwards said.</p><p>A spokesman for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the oil-and-gas industry in the state, said on Thursday that the agency was examining how much water operators disposed of in the affected area, and that it would take any necessary actions.</p><p>There have been 14 earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 in the Delaware basin, a section of the Permian, so far this year, compared with 11 in 2021 and three in 2020, according to water-analytics company B3 Insight, which analyzed state and national seismic activity data. As of mid-November, the number of earthquakes larger than magnitude 2 had more than doubled between 2020 and 2022 to reach 1,756, B3 data shows.</p><p>The temblors have generally caused little damage because they largely occur in uninhabited land. The impact of the recent quake, however, reverberated in Carlsbad, N.M. In San Antonio, University Health hospital evacuated a 105-year-old historic building after employees inside felt some swaying on Wednesday, a University Health spokeswoman said.</p><p>In 2021, the Railroad Commission created the Northern Culberson-Reeves Seismic Response Area to address seismicity in the region, which led to operators agreeing to restrictions on wastewater disposal as part of a response plan published in March. If an earthquake of at least 4.5 magnitude strikes that region next year—when some of the rules go into effect—it will trigger a regulatory response prompting companies to curtail usage of shallow water wells by 50% within about 4.5 kilometers, or 2.8 miles, of the seismic event for 18 months.</p><p>But with only a small number of active disposal wells within 4.5 kilometers of the earthquake, that response would do little to help, said Rob Bruant, a hydrologist and product director at B3 Insight. \"These seem like half-measures at this point,\" Dr. Bruant said.</p><p>Amanda Brock, the chief executive of Aris Water Solutions Inc., said that the industry has been working on the issue of seismicity with regulators and was on a path to improving its water-management practices. \"I don't think this is a tipping point,\" she said of this week's earthquake.</p><p>There are currently 48 active shallow water disposal wells and 26 deep wells across the entire 25-kilometer radial area, according to the Railroad Commission. Two deep disposal wells were previously shut after a 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck the area in March.</p><p>So far, Texas regulators have come down hardest on deep disposal wells typically at a depth of between 11,000-16,000 feet. Last year, in a separate designated area near Midland and Odessa, the commission curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into those wells. Seismic activity in that area has fallen significantly this year, state data show.</p><p>Stringent rules on water disposal in other U.S. regions have had a measurable impact on seismic activity. Regulators in Oklahoma began implementing rule changes following several 5.0-magnitude earthquakes in 2016, which helped ease the number and strength of temblors in the state, data showed.</p><p>As many as 28 shallow disposal wells sit within 10 miles of this week's earthquake, and oil companies in the past 18 months have pumped increasing amounts of water at higher pressure levels into a majority of them, putting the area at higher risk for seismic activity, according to B3 Insight.</p><p>The Railroad Commission said in March that although it believed deep injection wells to be a driver of seismic activity in the area, it didn't rule out shallow disposal wells as being linked to earthquakes. Injecting water into many wells—deep or shallow—has a cumulative effect over time on pressures on deep geological layers and can ultimately create earthquakes, said Heather DeShon, a professor in the earth-sciences department at Southern Methodist University.</p><p>As of the end of last year, large producers such as Chevron Corp. and Cimarex Energy Co.—now part of Coterra Energy Inc.—were depositing water in deep formations in the area, according to Railroad Commission data.</p><p>Chevron has previously voluntarily agreed to curtail injection of water into deep geological formations to 150,000 barrels a day in the agency-delineated seismic area by June 2023, a company spokeswoman said, and plans to reach that goal next month.</p><p>Coterra didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>How to handle millions of gallons of wastewater has long been one of the industry's trickiest problems. In recent years, water-infrastructure companies such as Aris Water Solutions Inc., Goodnight Midstream LLC and WaterBridge Resources LLC have built pipelines to transport the briny liquid far afield and dispose of it deep underground, or moved to recycle it and sell it back to frackers.</p><p>Write to Benoît Morenne at benoit.morenne@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Earthquake in Top Texas Oil Region Spurs Calls for New Fracking Rules</p>",
