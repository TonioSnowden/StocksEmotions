  "title": "Markets  Close Out  Turbulent  January  ----  By Paul Vigna and Anna Hirtenstein",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. stocks fell sharply Friday in their worst week since October, reflecting concern over the lingering economic impact of the coronavirus and ripples from the trading frenzy that has swept Wall Street this month. </p><p>   It was the second time in three days that broad market indexes fell sharply, including some big daily drops in companies that have recently powered the market higher such as Tesla Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. For the third straight day, the stocks at the center of a social-media frenzy -- led by GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. -- did the opposite of the Dow industrials. Friday, GameStop rose 68% and AMC jumped 54%. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2%, or 620.74 points, to 29982.62, and the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.9%, or 73.14 points, to 3714.24, a day after both gained roughly 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 2%, or 266.46 points, to 13070.69. </p><p>   Longtime investor favorites Amazon, Tesla and Facebook Inc. all fell Friday and for the week. So did Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. Declines in those shares appear directly related to the Reddit-fueled day trading, said Nicholas Colas, founder of DataTrek Research. </p><p>   If large investment firms' bets against stocks are losing money, many will need to sell some of their winning positions to rebalance, Mr. Colas said. \"It's a very brute-force explanation,\" he said, \"but fundamentally that's the mechanics of it.\" </p><p>   For the week, GameStop soared 400%, and AMC jumped 278%. </p><p>   Amazon, Facebook, Tesla and other big companies powered the market higher last year. Some of them benefited from the stay-at-home economy, even as many small businesses were decimated. That left many people struggling to reconcile a different type of market divide throughout 2020: a stumbling economy and a rallying stock market. </p><p>   Stock markets seesawed in January, buffeted by up-and-down news about the state of the U.S. economy, the spread of the coronavirus and the success of vaccination efforts. Pharmaceutical company Novavax Inc. soared 65% to $220.94 Friday, after it said its Covid-19 vaccine was 89% effective in a late-stage trial in the U.K. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 3.6% to $163.13 after saying its own vaccine was 66% effective. </p><p>   For the month, the Dow fell 2% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1%, even though both set several records throughout January. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of stress in markets, was up 9.5% Friday and rose 45% in January. </p><p>   \"Right now the market just can't shake off this frenzied retail trading,\" said Oanda analyst Edward Moya. \"The hedge funds are feeling the pressure.\" </p><p>   Robinhood Markets, a popular venue for online traders that had restricted trading in GameStop and AMC, said late Thursday it would reinstate some trading in stocks that it had curbed earlier. </p><p>   \"The GameStop story, where you have retail investors that are a new actor on the market, [is] one that people cannot ignore,\" said Luc Filip, head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"There are some critical links for hedge funds that are short on those stocks.\" </p><p>   While it is hard to precisely measure social media's effect on politics and people's views, capital markets offer a unique backdrop, said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. \"You can actually see it at work here in the stock market,\" she said. </p><p>   That can make social media's influence seem more dramatic, she said. Still, most trading is controlled by institutional investors: \"They have so much more money.\" </p><p>   In economic news, consumer spending in the U.S. declined by 0.2% in December, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It fell for the second straight month due to a rise in coronavirus cases, although a little less than economists had predicted. Household incomes rose 0.6%. </p><p>   Earnings season continued Friday, with oil major Chevron Corp. falling 4.3% to $85.20 after reporting a loss for the fourth quarter. Skyworks Solutions Inc., a chip maker that supplies Apple, rose 5.9% to $169.25 after it reported earnings after hours Thursday that beat analysts' estimates. Its board also approved a $2 billion share buyback. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. fell 1% to $207.97 after it posted revenue and earnings that beat expectations and said it expected to make billions in revenue in 2021 from its Covid-19 treatments. </p><p>   American Airlines Group Inc., which on Thursday reported a record loss last year, fell 5.1% to $17.17. </p><p>   The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.9% 395.85. The European Union's comparatively slow rollout of vaccines and recent delays to supply are creating concerns about prolonged lockdowns and weighing on markets, investors said. </p><p>   In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. </p><p></p>",
