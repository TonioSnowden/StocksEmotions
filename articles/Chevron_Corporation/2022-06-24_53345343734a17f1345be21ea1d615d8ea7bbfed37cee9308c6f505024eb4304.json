  "text": "<p>Officials didn't criticize those executives for profiteering, as President Biden has done in recent days, participants said, leading to more constructive discussions in a meeting that lasted for about an hour.</p><p>The group discussed ideas such as waiving Jones Act limitations on domestic shipping, accelerating permits for offshore energy production and the possibility of selling wintertime fuels throughout the summer.</p><p>Administration officials also indicated they are unlikely to pursue limits on exports, especially oil, saying they understand it would do little to lower prices, according to industry executives and lobbyists in or briefed on the meeting.</p><p>Industry officials expect little to come from what amounted to a brainstorming session. Both sides acknowledged there are few if any easy short-term solutions available, industry executives added.</p><p>Energy Department officials declined to comment on specific ideas exchanged between the two sides. An administration official familiar with the conversations said \"nothing was taken off the table.\"</p><p>Ms. Granholm acknowledged that refineries are currently running so hard they have little ability to increase production, and told executives the administration didn't want any of them to slow down a transition to biofuels that has further limited capacity in recent months.</p><p>\"The secretary set a collaborative tone early on by acknowledging the global nature of oil markets and prices, and that some companies, including Shell, have diminished refining capacity because we're busy converting century-old assets to produce biofuels,\" Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell USA Inc., said through a spokesman.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon, a driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on U.S. consumers ahead of midterm elections this year.</p><p>A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy, frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings.</p><p>The average national gasoline price slipped Thursday to $4.94 a gallon after sharp drops in oil prices and gasoline futures. The declines were driven by investor concerns that high fuel prices will crimp demand and that rising inflation overall is threatening economic growth.</p><p>For months the Biden administration has called on the oil industry to do more to help, spurring frequent pushback and criticism from industry in return.</p><p>Mr. Biden spent his early days in office moving to fulfill environmental promises to shift the country away from oil, and industry executives say he is now trying to blame them for his political problems, according to lobbyists.</p><p>In televised remarks and in a letter to fuel makers, Mr. Biden has recently urged oil companies to expand refining capacity.</p><p>In the letter Mr. Biden also accused them of profiteering, writing that \"at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto Americans are unacceptable.\"</p><p>That prompted a pointed response from Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth, who said Mr. Biden's rhetoric wasn't helping to solve the problem and was vilifying the oil industry. On Thursday Mr. Wirth said the meeting was an important step toward progress.</p><p>Mr. Biden's options to ease prices in the coming months are limited, according to analysts and economists. U.S. refining capacity has declined to about 17.9 million barrels a day as of the beginning of 2022, down about 5.4% from the start of 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p>",
