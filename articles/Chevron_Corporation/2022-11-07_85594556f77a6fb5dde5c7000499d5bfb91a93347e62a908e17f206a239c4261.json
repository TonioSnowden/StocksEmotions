  "text": "<p>If investors have learnt one thing from the Ukraine War, it is that energy security merits a premium. But the premium accorded to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/12a75d22-c69e-428a-9fe9-fd8b97091770\">Ithaca Energy</a> is still less than its owners had hoped for.</p> <p>The North Sea oil and gas producer is pricing its upcoming UK initial public offering at the lower end of the range on Monday. That would give it a capitalisation of up to £2.7bn ($3.1bn). Despite high oil and gas prices, the market remains down on companies that get hydrocarbons out of the ground.</p> <p>Even as recessionary fears in the west grow, Brent crude remains elevated at almost $100 a barrel. The market is still grappling with lower forecast supply from Russia and OPEC. </p> <p>But capital markets meanwhile remain fixated on the longer-term reality that fossil fuels are on the way out. This is reflected in record low valuations for UK E&amp;P groups which are also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e8e895f-881c-49ec-8ab0-dea3a46401b7\">facing windfall taxes</a>. The sizeable dividend promised by Ithaca was supposed to help investors look past that. </p> <p>Israeli E&amp;P Delek acquired Ithaca from the London market in 2017. It has since featured as a North Sea consolidator, acquiring Chevron's assets there for $1.7bn in 2019. Ithaca completed a $1.5bn acquisition, including a majority in the Cambo field, with private equity groups Blackstone and Bluewater this year. Total production might hit 80,000 daily barrels of oil equivalent next year, with a target of 100,000 expected in the medium term.</p> <p>Even so, on a reserves basis, its shares look fully valued. An enterprise value of $4bn equates to $16 a barrel of oil equivalent that is proven or probable. Its UK peers are a third cheaper on average. Harbour Energy, the UK's largest explorer producing mostly gas, trades at about $11. </p> <p>Ithaca does expect lucrative cash flows; dividends of $400mn are slated for next year. A yield of 14 per cent is double the current forward yield for the UK sector. </p> <p>But financing remains key. Equity investors are not the only ones that have gone cold on oil and gas. Ithaca must refinance $625mn of 2026 notes to free itself of payout restrictions. With financial conditions tightening across the world, that task will make tapping oil wells look like the easy bit.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Ithaca: oil and gas explorer is making big promises from little Britain' FT.com 7 November.
