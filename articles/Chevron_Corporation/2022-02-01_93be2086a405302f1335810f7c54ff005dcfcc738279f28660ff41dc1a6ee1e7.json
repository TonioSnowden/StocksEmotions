  "title": "Myanmar's Junta Leader Said Eat More Meat, but People Are Struggling to Live; One year since a military coup ended the country's transition to democracy, its economic crisis is deepening",
  "text": "<p>A year since Myanmar's military coup, incomes have plummeted, the currency has tanked and fuel prices have doubled. At markets in the country's largest city, Yangon, shoppers say they now pay roughly twice what they did a year ago for cooking oil, produce and soap.</p><p>\"We are struggling to live,\" said Than Htay, a 62-year-old retired municipal worker whose teenage daughter has started working as a maid to help support the family. His earnings as a motorcycle taxi driver are no longer sufficient to cover basic food costs and rent, he said.</p><p>Global food prices rose to a 10-year high in 2021, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in part due to rising fuel and fertilizer costs. But the effects have been magnified in Myanmar, where Covid-19 and political turmoil collided to create a deeper crisis than what was faced by many other nations.</p><p>The country's return to authoritarian rule and its economic downturn are particularly stark because they follow a decade of progress on both fronts. The coup reversed a delicate transition to democracy, and, experts and residents say, hard-won development gains are quickly unraveling as well. In late December, the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 2021's economic and political turmoil drove almost half of Myanmar's 5.1 million people into poverty, wiping away more than 15 years of gains.</p><p>In the past year, the military junta has prosecuted civilian leaders—including Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi—and sought to crush peaceful protests with deadly force. Soldiers and police have killed more than 1,500 people and arrested over 11,000 others, according to the nonprofit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Some opponents of the military have joined an armed resistance, exacerbating the country's civil conflicts.</p><p>The turmoil has prolonged stagnation and stymied recovery in an economy that had already been brought to a near standstill by the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Bank says Myanmar's gross domestic product fell by 18% in 2021, a much larger contraction than neighbors such as Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam experienced. It is forecast to grow just 1% in the current year, a much smaller recovery.</p><p>\"In normal situations you'd expect after a contraction of that size that you'd have a stronger rebound of the economy, just because of the very low base effect,\" said Kim Edwards, a senior economist in Myanmar for the World Bank. He said the country's economy remains critically weak.</p><p>The Feb. 1 coup led to nationwide strikes that crippled the workforce and left families without wages. As fighting intensified between the military and armed insurgents, it became harder to move food from farmlands to cities. A drop in international commerce and low reserves—depleted further after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York froze about $1 billion of Myanmar's foreign currency reserves shortly after the coup—have contributed to a U.S. dollar shortage. The local currency has lost about 25% of its value.</p><p>Sanctions brought by the U.S. and other Western democracies against dozens of individuals—including top military leaders—and major state-owned conglomerates, haven't had a major impact on the broader economy. But pressure from lawmakers, activists and other stakeholders has mounted on these governments to blacklist Myanmar's energy sector, the country's single largest source of foreign revenue. Analysts say oil and gas sanctions are more likely after TotalEnergies SE of France, U.S.-based Chevron Corp. and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. of Australia said last month they would exit Myanmar.</p><p>May May Aung, a 35-year-old mother of two, said she is learning to live with less. She and her husband were among the many people in Myanmar aspiring to climb into a growing middle class, only to find themselves plunged back into poverty in a matter of months. Her family relies on income from her husband's job at a furniture factory in a Yangon industrial zone, where his wages were cut by 20% last year.</p><p>They used to enjoy a modest indulgence of three cups of instant coffee each day—now they have one. She rations her laundry detergent to make it last longer and adjusts the family's meals based on the lowest-priced items at the market each week.</p><p>\"These days, we have to think a lot about what we use,\" said Ms. Aung, who lives in Yangon's North Okkalapa neighborhood. \"We don't buy anything extra, only what we need.\"</p><p>Nay Thurein, 39, said everyday hardship was starkly apparent in his Yangon neighborhood by late last year. In October, he reduced the hours he worked selling car accessories to open a donation-run restaurant offering meals for the poor—those who can afford it pay as much as they want, others can eat for the equivalent of about 28 cents, or pay nothing at all. The project was so successful that similar eateries quickly cropped up in other major cities.</p><p>The number of people who come to his shop unable to pay anything is getting bigger, he said. Many of his poorest regulars are taxi drivers and vendors who work in nearby markets.</p><p>\"The saddest thing for me is that I can't feed them all,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Feliz Solomon at feliz.solomon@wsj.com</p><p>Myanmar's Junta Leader Said Eat More Meat, but People Are Struggling to Live</p>",
