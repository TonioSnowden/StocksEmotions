  "text": "<p>Are you looking to make a political statement as you invest your family nest egg? You have plenty of options, at least if you support fashionable \"environmental, social and governance\" causes like climate and diversity. If you lean unstylishly to the right, you can buy into niche mutual funds that choose stocks with free-market or religious principles in mind. But what if you want to avoid politics? That's easier said than done.</p><p>The standard advice to retail investors is to buy passively managed index funds, which invest in the stocks of a broad range of companies. That's an excellent way to balance risk and return, to ride waves of economic growth and offset losses from individual companies that sink beneath them. But Vivek Ramaswamy, a newly minted investment-fund executive, says that politics have quickly come to dominate index funds too. He has an ambitious plan that aims to break its grip.</p><p>The problem arises from what's known as \"the separation of ownership from ownership.\" When you invest in, say, a BlackRock fund, you own shares in the fund, which in turn owns stocks or other underlying assets. Formal ownership of a company share gives BlackRock a vote in elections for the board of directors and on resolutions governing corporate policy. Multiply that share by hundreds of millions, and it adds up to real clout.</p><p>The three biggest fund managers—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—manage a combined total of some $20 trillion in assets. Their holdings of Exxon Mobil Corp., to take a prominent example, totaled more than 890 million shares, or about 21% of the company, as of March 31. When they vote as a bloc, that can easily tip the balance, as it did in 2021 when the big three backed a slate of Exxon Mobil directors put forth by the tiny activist fund manager Engine No. 1, which held fewer than a million shares.</p><p>\"It was an accident of this investment structure that gave that much voting power to that concentrated group of actors with an unprecedented aggregation of capital,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says in a Zoom interview from his home office in Columbus, Ohio. The big fund managers began only a few years ago \"to exercise that voting power to advance social and political agendas.\"</p><p>When you buy an index fund that's managed in this fashion, you're promoting ESG objectives whether you want to or not. \"The index-fund industry was based on the premise that these asset managers weren't smart enough to pick stocks,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. Are we supposed to believe they're \"enlightened enough to know how to design an entire society\"?</p><p>But never mind society, what about your retirement fund? Engine No. 1 describes its goal as helping companies \"transform their businesses to be more sustainable.\" Its website proudly features a July 2022 Journal news story with the headline \"After Defeating Exxon, Engine No. 1 Works With Oil Giants on Emissions.\" If you want to avoid politics, this obviously isn't the fund manager for you. But neither is any other firm that would join an effort to \"defeat\" a company in which it has invested your capital.</p><p>When a fund manager uses your money \"to advance agendas that do not serve the capital owner's interest,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says, \"that represents a large-scale fiduciary breach.\" But what can you do about it? Litigation is prohibitively expensive, and regulatory solutions are unpromising with an ESG-friendly administration in Washington. Buying stocks directly and voting them yourself is a high-risk investment, not to mention a labor-intensive one, and for a nonbillionaire the return in recovered voting power is trivial. Besides, pursuing any of these possible remedies would take you down a political rabbit hole, exactly what you're trying to avoid.</p><p>Enter Mr. Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old wunderkind. He founded a biotech investment firm in 2014, at 28, then left it in 2021 and published two books, \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam\" last August and \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence,\" forthcoming next month. \"I enjoyed writing the books,\" he says. \"I thought I was going to keep going at it.\"</p><p>Instead he decided that \"problems in our culture, created in the market, . . . needed to be solved through the market,\" and Strive Asset Management was born, with Mr. Ramaswamy as executive chairman. Its first offering, the Strive U.S. Energy ETF (ticker symbol DRLL), began trading this week on the New York Stock Exchange, where Mr. Ramaswamy will ring the closing bell on Wednesday.</p><p>Strive is an activist investment manager. \"Our mission,\" its website declares, \"is to restore the voices of everyday citizens in the American economy by leading companies to focus on excellence over politics.\" The firm won't do this, Mr. Ramaswamy emphasizes, by selecting stocks in accord with \"right-wing values\" the way ESG funds promote left-wing values.</p><p>Instead its first few funds, including DRLL, will be managed passively, and subsequent ones actively, for profit, not politics. As an investment vehicle, DRLL is effectively identical to BlackRock's iShares U.S. Energy ETF (IYE). It will own shares in the same companies in virtually the same proportions, rebalanced each quarter according to the same rules, and charge the same management fee (0.41%). That means any benefit to shareholders from Strive's efforts will accrue equally to investors in IYE.</p><p>But Strive seeks to beat the big fund managers at their own shareholder-activism game. That presents an obvious difficulty, akin to the challenge of starting a third political party: Even if your views are far more popular than the incumbents', you're starting from zero. How do you overcome their massive advantage in money, loyalty and voting power?</p><p>The Engine No. 1 saga points to one answer: by using the power to introduce resolutions and board candidates and inducing the big funds to vote your way. Mr. Ramaswamy's strategy entails heightening ESG's contradictions by crafting resolutions that \"call the bluff of the doublespeak,\" by which he means the claim that fund mangers are simultaneously \"using capital to address shared global challenges like systemic racism and global climate change\" and \"exclusively looking after the financial interests of their clients.\"</p><p>Thus, he says Strive might introduce or support a resolution stating: \"All current and future investments shall be evaluated exclusively through the lens of financially measurable return on investment.\" A \"no\" vote from an ostensibly apolitical investment fund would amount to a disavowal of its fiduciary duty to its clients. But if the resolution passes, Mr. Ramaswamy says, it would \"govern over any other prior shareholder resolution\" and thereby direct management to pursue profit regardless of political objectives.</p><p>Under such a resolution, Chevron Corp., for instance, could disregard the 2021 shareholder-approved measure directing it to reduce \"Scope 3 emissions\"—i.e., carbon dioxide produced by others up and down its supply chain. Mr. Ramaswamy sees that policy as especially pernicious, a way for asset managers to \"deputize\" the company \"to also affect the behaviors of smaller players in its supply chains—family-owned businesses, private companies, etc.\"—that \"otherwise should and would have been insulated from the politicized shareholder demands.\"</p><p>Another example of the ESG \"bluff\" is this statement from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's 2021 letter to CEOs: \"We expect companies . . . to have a talent strategy that allows them to draw on the fullest set of talent possible. As you issue sustainability reports, we ask that your disclosures on talent strategy fully reflect your long-term plans to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.\"</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy suggests this counterresolution: \"All hiring at every level, including executive and board hiring, shall be based exclusively on job qualifications, without regard to race, sex, sexual orientation or political belief.\" If DEI aims merely \"to draw on the fullest set of talent possible,\" how could BlackRock justify a vote against directing managers to refrain from illegal or politically based employment discrimination?</p><p>\"That might sound pretty simple,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. But this March Apple, the world's biggest company by market capitalization, \"over the recommendation of management, adopted a 'racial equity audit' shareholder proposal,\" which BlackRock supported.</p><p>Between annual shareholder meetings, Strive will employ \"shareholder engagement\"—lobbying managers and directors on behalf of its profit-seeking agenda. \"Shareholder engagement means letters, private meetings, public meetings, etc., exercising your voice and delivering that shareholder mandate,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. \"As BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard do today, Strive will do in a different way. I will be the chief ambassador for delivering those messages. And the greater capital we have in DRLL, the more weight shareholder engagement will carry with the boards and management teams of U.S. energy companies.\"</p><p>The firm's choice of the energy industry for its debut fund is a strategic one. \"It is, first of all, probably the sector that has suffered the greatest . . . economic damage inflicted by the ESG movement,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. \"Most people who work in the energy industry don't work there because they think oil and gas is contributing to global catastrophe, but because they think it contributes to global prosperity.\"</p><p>The Exxon Mobil board changes and the Chevron Scope 3 resolution were both approved over the opposition of management. Energy executives and lower-level employees alike are \"looking for an off-ramp from the shareholder mandates that they can see firsthand have actually destroyed value in their sector,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. \"Our corporate engagement effectively opens up the post-ESG mandate for the sector.\"</p><p>Another advantage: Energy funds have been out of favor with investors, giving Strive an opportunity to grab attention with DRLL. The fund's BlackRock counterpart, IYE, has only some $2.5 billion in assets under management, roughly 1/4,000th of the firm's total. If Strive can exceed that with DRLL, Mr. Ramaswamy says, \"that will be the event that I think sends seismic shock waves across the sector,\" even though the big funds' total investment in any given company will still dwarf Strive's. \"Is that achievable?\" Mr. Ramaswamy asks. \"I can't comment on that on the record.\" But he sounds confident.</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy sees enormous growth potential in energy stocks. \"The capital-market investment consensus was there is no oil and gas business after 2030—this line of business disappears,\" he says. ESG constraints promise to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy. Meanwhile, low interest rates accelerated a flight of capital from energy and toward technology companies that expect high future returns. When cash is cheap, \"the opportunity cost of capital in the present is lower, so you value the future more highly,\" Mr. Ramaswamy says. Higher interest rates and an unshackling from ESG could bring \"a great reversal of fortunes between the U.S. tech sector and the U.S. energy sector.\"</p><p>Over the long run, Mr. Ramaswamy aspires to build Strive into a serious competitor to the big funds across a wide range of investments. He thinks that's possible because the giants will have a hard time disentangling themselves from ESG.</p><p>\"When you listen to BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard say, 'This is what our clients want,' there's a certain sense in which they're not wrong,\" he says. \"Some of their clients, and especially their institutional clients\"—he cites the California Public Employees' Retirement System and its New York counterpart—\"are demanding that they behave this way.\" (The capital these pension funds manage ultimately belongs to government employees and retirees, another degree of separation of ownership from ownership.)</p><p>When the funds' biggest clients make such demands, it limits the investment menu for everyone, including red-state pension funds as well as retail investors. If Strive offers a viable alternative, Mr. Ramaswamy says, its larger competitors will \"have to choose which lunch they're going to eat, and they're going to leave another one on the table. The one they've left on the table is the one that we're stepping up to pursue ourselves.\"</p><p>Mr. Taranto is the Journal's editorial features editor.</p><p>How Woke Capital Politicized Your Retirement Account</p>",
