  "title": "Biden's Energy Orders Create Both Peril and Opportunity",
  "text": "<p>President Biden's first week in office has been trying for the sector: Last week, the administration revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary ban on federal leasing and permitting for oil and gas. On Wednesday, the administration announced a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal territory. While the actions resulted in a steep selloff, the moves were telegraphed on the campaign trail.</p><p>Companies with heavier federal lease exposure -- including EOG Resources, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum -- started underperforming the broader basket of oil and gas exploration companies in the middle of last year. The threat seemed plausible given the precedent that the Obama administration set in 2016 when it suspended most new leases for coal mining on federal lands. The same companies suffered steeper drops than the sector overall since last week, when the Biden administration announced a temporary moratorium.</p><p>The real surprise seems to be that the Biden administration is weighing the possibility of stopping new permits or not allowing permit renewals on federal territory. The order calls for a \"rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices\" -- something the industry hadn't anticipated. The move is likely to spur legal challenges.</p><p>However broad, the effects won't be immediate: Federal lease-exposed producers have stocked up on permits that should last a couple of years. In the longer run, the move does put pressure on producers that will have to move away from acreage they know well and have proven to be productive -- particularly those in the Permian Basin. Roughly one-quarter of U.S. oil production comes from both onshore and offshore leases managed by the Department of the Interior.</p><p>On the one hand, the administration's actions signal a far less-friendly relationship with the fossil-fuel industry -- even if legal challenges and a narrow Democratic lead in Congress cap its ambitions. That partly explains why energy companies across the board have registered a selloff. Yet it also forces a brake on U.S. production growth in a way that should support hydrocarbon prices. RBC Capital Markets estimates that the production decline from not issuing or renewing federal permits could increase global oil prices by $5 a barrel over time. For energy majors with a large international presence such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil, that could be supportive overall.</p><p>All things considered, some of the companies affected are babies thrown out with the bath water. They include oil-field-services companies Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Their business will be hurt by less U.S. activity in the future, but the world's need for hydrocarbons is unchanged. They can move some resources where they are needed. These companies are down more than 10% in the past week, in line with the fall seen by producers such as EOG Resources, which have higher federal territory exposure. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have limited concentration on federal lands, also lost almost 10% of their value in the past week.</p><p>As with any sign of danger, the first instinct may be to flee. But sometimes such times call for closer inspection.</p>",
