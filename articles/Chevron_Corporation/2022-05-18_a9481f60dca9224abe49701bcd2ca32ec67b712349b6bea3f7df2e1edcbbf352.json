  "title": "World News: Chevron Allowed to Maintain Venezuela Operations",
  "text": "<p>Chevron didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>The extension of the license allows Chevron to have talks with Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-owned oil company with which it has a joint venture. Previously the company couldn't directly negotiate with any officials sanctioned by the U.S. Chevron has been lobbying the U.S. to permit it to drill for crude and sell it in the world market to help bring down energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>A Biden administration official said as part of the moves, the U.S. would also remove Carlos Erik Malpica-Flores, the nephew of Venezuela's first lady and a former top PDVSA official, from a list of sanctioned individuals.</p><p>The moves by the U.S. appear to be a reply to a meeting by senior U.S. officials, including Juan Gonzalez, the senior National Security Council official in charge of Latin America, and James Story, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, with Mr. Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials in March. As a result of those meetings, the Maduro government freed two U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela.</p><p>The senior U.S. officials emphasized Tuesday that the U.S. was acting at the request of the government of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized as interim president of Venezuela by the U.S. After the March meetings, Mr. Guaido and others in the Venezuelan opposition feared that their aspirations for a restoration of democracy in the country would be sacrificed by the Biden administration's need to increase world oil production to lower oil prices.</p><p>Mr. Guaido's office in a statement denied that the Venezuelan opposition had asked the Biden administration for the lifting of \"personal sanctions\" as in the case of Mr. Malpica-Flores.</p><p>U.S. officials denied that the latest moves by the administration had anything to do with the world energy situation.</p>",
