  "text": "<p>   Houston has set the standard for bringing workers back to the office during Covid-19. About 85% of its businesses have employees at their desks or have plans to do so, one of the highest rates in the nation, according to firms that track the return-to-office trend. </p><p>   But Houston office floors are barely half full. While the number of workers showing up at their desks has been rising, the office crowds are far smaller than those showing up at restaurants, basketball games and other gathering spots. </p><p>   A big reason is that most Houston companies have implemented hybrid strategies, combining office and remote work. As this policy has played out, the average worker is showing up at the office about 10.7 days a month, compared with 17 before the pandemic, according to an analysis from Central Houston Inc., which represents downtown landlords, businesses and residents. </p><p>   Central Houston's chief executive, Kristopher Larson, suggests that Houston's return-to-office rate will hit a \"glass ceiling\" limiting the post-pandemic return. </p><p>   Houston and other Texas cities have been closely watched during the pandemic because workers there have consistently returned to the office at a higher rate than those in other states, according to Kastle Systems, a security company that monitors access-card swipes in 10 large U.S. cities. </p><p>   The state's low reliance on public transportation and decision to keep public schools open through most of the pandemic have paved the way for more workers to return to the office. Dallas, Houston and Austin last week recorded office-return rates of 51%, 52% and 58%, respectively, according to Kastle. </p><p>   The Lone Star State offers an early glimpse into what the return-to-office movement might look like across the U.S. this year, as Covid-19 infection rates plummet and more companies enact back-to-work plans but offices remain well below capacity. </p><p>   \"It's hard to imagine, when you look at office workers who can do their jobs remotely, that those numbers are going to get above 60% to 65% nationwide,\" said Brian Kropp, chief of human-resources research for advisory and research firm Gartner. \"This is just the remote hybrid future. We have kind of arrived.\" </p><p>   That future has enormous implications for the value of commercial property, the health of business districts and city tax revenues derived from real-estate owners. Thousands of restaurants, bars, stores, barbers and other small businesses throughout the country also depend heavily on commuters and office workers. </p><p>   Chevron U.S.A. Inc., one of Houston's largest employers, with nearly 6,000 people in downtown Houston, allows workers two days of remote work a week. </p><p>   Bottle Rocket, a Dallas-based app and digital consulting firm, will maintain an office in the city but has told employees they can choose to work from anywhere. \"Companies will like employees to be in the office on a regular basis, but there's a large segment of the workforce that doesn't want that anymore,\" said Rajesh Midha, the firm's chief executive. </p><p></p>",
