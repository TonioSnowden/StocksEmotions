  "text": "<p>The results represented a dramatic turnaround from a year earlier, when Exxon reported a quarterly loss of $1.1 billion and Chevron lost $8.3 billion as demand for oil and gas plummeted due to the closing of economies world-wide due to the virus.</p><p>Some of the largest European oil companies also showed strong results earlier in the week. Royal Dutch Shell PLC reported $5.5 billion in net income, while TotalEnergies SE posted $3.5 billion in profits.</p><p>The oil and gas industry has recovered from unprecedented losses in 2020 as economies have reopened this year, sending prices to their highest levels in two years. U.S. oil prices have mostly stayed above $60 per barrel since March, after briefly turning negative in April and remaining below $50 for most of 2020. West Texas Intermediate closed at $73.81 on Friday, up 19 cents or 0.3%.</p><p>Still, none of the major Western producers said they would increase capital spending, as the companies face pressure from investors to moderate growth and clean up their emissions amid concerns about increasing regulations and climate change. Some European companies have promised to let production decline as they invest more in renewable energy.</p><p>Exxon cut its annual capital budget last year to $19 billion or less from $25 billion. It said Friday its capital expenditures this year will be closer to $16 billion and that its oil and gas production was down 2% from the same period last year.</p><p>\"We think we have a good plan on our investments, we're making good progress on debt,\" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a call with analysts. \"We are focused on bringing in more profitable, higher-value barrels.\"</p><p>Chevron said Friday that it, too, wouldn't raise capital spending. It had $5.3 billion of capital expenditures in the first six months of 2021, compared with $7.7 billion in the first six months of last year. Chevron previously said it would increase annual production at about 3% or less through 2025 and give priority to returning money to shareholders.</p><p>Both companies benefited from strong profits in their chemical businesses as demand for plastics and other products surged this year.</p><p>The restrained spending is an overture to investors who fled the sector after a decade of poor returns and longer-term concerns about the future for fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Wall Street is not looking for accelerated reinvestment into the oil and gas business,\" said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners. \"This is a combo of ESG and energy transition concerns and scar tissue from the past decade.\"</p><p>Shares in many oil and gas companies have sharply rebounded this year but remain below pre-Covid-19 prices. Chevron's stock is up more than 20% this year, but down about 4% from February of last year, while Exxon is up nearly 40%, but is down about 5% from pre-pandemic prices.</p><p>Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said many investors still question oil producers' commitment to capital discipline, especially with rising commodity prices. \"Demand for our products has fully recovered, except for jet [fuel],\" Mr. Breber said. \"Demand for our stock is more slowly recovering.\"</p><p>To lure them back, Chevron has given priority to shareholder payouts. On Friday, it said it would resume share buybacks, which it paused in March 2020, at a rate of $2 billion to $3 billion a year. Chevron increased its dividend by 4% in April. Shell and Total reinstated buybacks this week.</p><p>Chevron on Thursday also announced a new business unit dedicated to technologies to lower carbon emissions. The move followed an announcement in February by Exxon that it would invest $3 billion through 2025 in a new, low-carbon business division.</p><p>Increasing investor payouts could be more difficult for Exxon, whose balance sheet holds more debt than Chevron's. The Irving, Texas-based company has nearly $60 billion in debt, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, compared with Chevron's roughly $38 billion in debt. Exxon held its dividend flat earlier this year.</p><p>Exxon will need to increase capital spending in its core assets, particularly in Guyana and the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, to generate the cash it needs to pay down debt and reward investors, said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>Exxon, the largest Western oil company, lost three seats on its board of directors at its annual meeting in May to hedge fund Engine No. 1, which had argued Exxon spent recklessly on unprofitable projects and had no strategy to navigate the energy transition.</p><p>\"Capex increases on the core business are a challenging narrative,\" Mr. Borkhataria said. \"But Exxon's $15 billion dividend is not going to be funded by low-carbon assets anytime soon, so the capital will need to be allocated to the core business for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>So far, Exxon has held to its spending cuts. In the Permian, it has reduced the number of rigs it is operating since March of last year by around 85% to less than 10, according to Andrew McConn, an analyst at Enverus, an energy data analytics firm. Chevron has made similar reductions, he said.</p>",
