  "title": "Inside Climate Bill, A Broad Energy Push",
  "text": "<p>At the insistence of Mr. Manchin, the legislative package provides support for traditional sources of energy like oil, gas and coal along with nuclear power. There are tax subsidies for plants that capture the carbon emissions from burning those fossil fuels, and others for producing hydrogen, often done with natural gas.</p><p>Even expanding offshore wind and solar-power development on federal land would now require the federal government to offer more access for drilling on federal territory.</p><p>Mr. Schumer met behind closed doors Thursday with his caucus to press the case for the package, while acknowledging Democrats had a narrow road to passage with all Republicans opposed.</p><p>On Thursday Mr. Manchin called the deal \"an all-in energy policy\" to boost U.S. energy independence.</p><p>Under the bill, the Interior Department would be required to offer up at least two million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of offshore acreage to oil and gas producers every year for the next decade. If they fall short, they wouldn't be able to advance some permitting aspects of the wind and solar projects on federal land. It would be the first-ever required minimum acreage for offshore oil and gas leasing and significantly increase the acreage requirements for onshore leasing.</p><p>The compromise deal comes after months of wrangling between Mr. Manchin and other Democratic leaders, including President Biden, over how to balance efforts to curb emissions with an emerging energy crisis and rising inflation. Gasoline, diesel and natural-gas prices all hit all-time highs this year, and U.S. allies in Europe are facing energy shortages in part caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Some environmentalists and liberals in Congress expressed concerns about the provisions Thursday. But more have expressed enthusiastic support, saying the deal is needed in a Senate evenly split between Republicans and Democrats to secure Mr. Manchin's critical vote for costly programs that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"Tough trade-offs are the only path for getting major climate investments over the finish line,\" said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of Evergreen Action, a frequent conduit between Mr. Biden and progressives. \"And a major investment package like this is absolutely essential to meeting our climate goals.\"</p><p>Mr. Manchin, who has coal-business ties and represents a coal-and-gas state, has said that the U.S. needs to ensure its supply of domestic energy while the renewables industry continues to grow. Many of his allies doubled down on that view after Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed Western countries to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas.</p><p>Mr. Manchin has also said he wants to keep the U.S. from becoming dependent on China for batteries, other clean-energy technologies and the minerals needed to build them.</p><p>\"Putin weaponized energy like no other time I've ever seen,\" Mr. Manchin said Thursday. \"I think [Chinese president] Xi Jinping will do the same with rare-earth minerals.\"</p><p>So while the deal gives subsidies to promote zero-emissions electric vehicles, those would now be tied toward requirements that auto makers use U.S. minerals.</p><p>Starting Jan. 1, 2024, for a vehicle to qualify for a tax credit, 40% of the critical minerals in its battery would have to come from either a U.S. mine, a free-trade country or a U.S. facility that recycles minerals, a practice that isn't widespread.</p><p>To boost domestic energy, the bill includes a new per-kilowatt-hour production tax credit for nuclear power to staunch the closing of nuclear plants.</p><p>For the oil industry, the bill would also effectively reinstate an 80 million-acre sale for the Gulf of Mexico from last year that a federal judge had invalidated. It was the largest offshore oil-and-gas lease sale in U.S. history -- producing $191 million in bids.</p><p>Major oil companies such as Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell PLC that had bid in the offshore auction could quickly benefit. Some have said that lease sales are essential to maintaining their U.S. production.</p><p>Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden applauded the deal and highlighted its promise of new lease sales to come. Shell has been investing in new platforms to boost its Gulf operations, and he said production there has to go on.</p><p>\"The world needs new oil and gas to come on stream,\" he said. \"Just curtailing domestic supply, in the hope that somehow domestic demand will follow suit, is not a realistic policy.\"</p><p>Senate Democrats said the more climate-focused provisions of their bill would reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions 40%. That would help revive Mr. Biden's initiative to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p><p>If approved by Congress, the bill would be the biggest federal spending package to address climate change. The last similar move spent about $90 billion for clean energy more than a decade ago.</p><p>---</p><p>Siobhan Hughes and Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
