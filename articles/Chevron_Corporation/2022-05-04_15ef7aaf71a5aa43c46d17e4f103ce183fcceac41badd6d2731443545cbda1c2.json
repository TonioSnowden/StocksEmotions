  "title": "U.S. Stocks Rise as Investors Digest Fed Decision; All three major indexes ahead more than 1% after being down earlier in the session",
  "text": "<p>Stocks were initially little changed after the Fed announced it would raise interest-rates by half a percentage point and begin to shrink its $9 trillion asset portfolio next month. Investors had widely expected both decisions heading into the conclusion of the central bank's policy meeting.</p><p>What did catch some by surprise was Mr. Powell putting to rest the idea that the Fed may raise interest rates by 75 basis points later this year. Federal-funds futures, which traders use to track changes in interest-rate expectations, had previously shown the market pricing in an 95% chance of the Fed making such a move in June.</p><p>With stocks and bonds on shaky footing as of late, many investors had been worried that the pace at which the Fed tightens monetary policy would trip up markets. Others have been grappling with fears that the central bank, which is raising rates swiftly to try to tamp down inflation, may inadvertently tip the economy into recession.</p><p>\"This is the question markets are dealing with: Where is the Fed going? Is it really this series of rate hikes going to 5% or 6% that will end in the cooling of the economy?\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research.</p><p>Stocks rose across the board, with energy shares leading the gains.</p><p>Exxon Mobil and Chevron rose more than 2% apiece, boosted by rising oil prices.</p><p>Meanwhile, technology and consumer-discretionary shares, which had been among the biggest decliners in the market earlier Wednesday, flew higher. The group had taken a hit earlier as investors facing higher interest rates shied away from companies with higher valuations.</p><p>Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta rose more than 2% each.</p><p>Corporate earnings also spurred volatility in the market Wednesday.</p><p>Airbnb shares rose 5.2% after the company said it expects to post its first full-year net profit this year. Starbucks added 10% after the coffee chain said profits and sales grew in the most recent quarter.</p><p>Meanwhile, government bond prices climbed, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 2.903%, compared with 2.957% Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The bond market has been hit by its worst rout in decades as investors have grappled with accelerating inflation and the prospect of rapid interest-rate increases by the Fed. That has added to the turmoil across the stock market this year. Mr. Powell's comments appeared to ease the selling pressure on Treasurys Wednesday.</p><p>Other officials expressed confidence in the economic picture. The U.S. economy remains strong despite the fact that it shrank in the first quarter of this year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in London.</p><p>In commodities markets, oil prices rose after the European Union proposed banning imports of Russian crude within six months and banning imports of refined oil products from Russia by the end of the year. U.S. crude oil was last up 5.9% to $108.49 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, stocks were mostly lower. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 1.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1%, and South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.1%. Markets in mainland China and Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Rise as Investors Digest Fed Decision</p>",
