  "text": "<p>Could Take Months</p><p>Israel is undergoing a mass cleanup of its beaches after an oil spill from an unidentified vessel left much of the country's 120-mile Mediterranean shoreline covered with black sticky tar, in one of the country's worst ecological disasters.</p><p>The spill has affected 90% of Israel's coastline and the cleanup could take months, if not years, Israel's Nature and Parks Authority said. On Tuesday, Israel's government approved plans to allocate $13.8 million to clean up its shores.</p><p>The first reports of the spill came last week after a winter storm created strong waves that brought blobs of tar ashore in Israel's north. Israeli officials are searching for the ship responsible for the spill.</p><p>-- Felicia Schwartz</p><p>---</p><p>OBITUARY</p><p>Architect of Saudi Oil</p><p>Supremacy Dies, 90</p><p>Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's long-serving oil minister and the public face of the 1973 oil embargo that punctuated the country's newfound role as an oil-market superpower, has died. He was 90.</p><p>Mr. Yamani, who suffered from poor health for years, died in London, Saudi state TV announced Tuesday. He was expected to be buried in his hometown of Mecca, his former colleagues said. His son, Hani Yamani, said he had died on Monday.</p><p>He served in the post for nearly 25 years, starting in 1962. When he took over the oil ministry, Saudi Arabia was a middling producer in the oil-rich Mideast. But the kingdom's deposits, it turns out, were much bigger than its neighbors', and soon the country's output was soaring. Amid a wave of oil-field nationalizations across the region, Mr. Yamani led talks to take control of the Saudi Arabia Oil Co., then a joint venture between the predecessors to Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.</p><p>Key to Saudi Arabia's market dominance was Mr. Yamani's insistence that Saudi Arabia invest in spare -- or unused -- production capacity. It was an expensive strategy, but it cemented Riyadh's ability to quickly ramp up and down output, quickly influencing global prices.</p><p>-- Benoit Faucon</p><p>---</p><p>MEXICO</p><p>U.S. Denies Bail to</p><p>Spouse of 'El Chapo'</p><p>The U.S.-born wife of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman was ordered held without bail at a court appearance after her arrest for allegedly helping her husband run his drug empire and carry out an escape from a maximum-security Mexican prison, the U.S. Justice Department said.</p><p>Emma Coronel, 31 years old, was arrested on Monday at Washington's Dulles Airport. She faces charges of conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the U.S., according to an arrest affidavit, signed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent.</p><p>For five years, as her husband was on the run and in prison, Ms. Coronel acted as Mr. Guzman's courier, sending instructions to associates that dealt with increasing heroin production, paying bribes, buying weapons, and helping to bust Mr. Guzman out of prison, the affidavit said.</p><p>-- Jose de Cordoba</p><p>---</p><p>ECUADOR</p><p>Dozens of Inmates</p><p>Killed in Prison Riots</p><p>Dozens of Ecuadorean inmates were killed in bloody confrontations between rival gangs in three prisons, the government said.</p><p>The head of Ecuador's penitentiary agency, Edmundo Moncayo, said the riots broke out Tuesday in a prison in the coastal city of Guayaquil, as well as two other prisons in the provinces of Cotopaxi and Azuay. At least 62 inmates were killed, he said.</p><p>President Lenin Moreno said 800 police officers were sent to regain control of the prisons. About 20 police officers were injured, authorities said.</p><p>Latin America's notoriously overcrowded prisons are hotbeds for deadly riots and bloody fights between rival gangs.</p><p>-- Ryan Dube</p>",
