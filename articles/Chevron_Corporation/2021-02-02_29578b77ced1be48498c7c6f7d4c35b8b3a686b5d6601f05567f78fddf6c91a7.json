  "title": "Oil Tie-Up Isn't as Crazy as It Sounds --- Exxon-Chevron merger talk is a '90s flashback",
  "text": "<p>Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest descendants of Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, discussed a potential merger last year, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The companies' shares barely moved Monday morning, perhaps reflecting skepticism that such a deal can happen.</p><p>As over-the-top as the idea sounds -- it could be the largest corporate merger ever -- it isn't inconceivable. Today's oil market conditions look similar to those that made oil megamergers possible starting in the late 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis led to a sudden collapse in global growth and oil demand. The resulting glut considerably weakened energy giants, leading to cost cuts and paving the way for big tie-ups. Both Covid-19 and Asia's crisis knocked about a third off the average Brent price in 2020 and 1998, respectively.</p><p>That backdrop was what preceded Exxon's merger with Mobil in 1999, No. 1 and 2 in the U.S. at the time. Chevron's 2001 nuptials with Texaco brought together what were then Nos. 2 and 3. Combined, Exxon and Chevron would satisfy about 4.3% of global oil demand -- only a percentage point higher than the combined share of Exxon and Mobil a year after their merger.</p><p>It is unclear how close the deal is to materializing. Antitrust concerns aside, Chevron investors might be cautious about merging with Exxon as it faces scrutiny from securities regulators and activist investors.</p><p>But the news is a clear sign of how weakened the energy markets have become. A combination would bring at least four of Standard Oil's pieces back together. At the height of its dominance, Standard Oil controlled 95% of U.S. refining -- long before anyone realized there were vast petroleum deposits in places like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela.</p><p>The mere fact that Exxon and Chevron are considering the once unthinkable shows their executives grasp the enormousness of the oil market's challenges.</p>",
