  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Chevron Plans to Sell California Campus",
  "text": "<p>Chevron said it would cover moving costs for employees who voluntarily opt to move to Houston, as it determines the extent to which it will reduce its staffing in the Golden State. It said it is looking for a new, smaller space to lease in San Ramon, in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and expects to move from its existing headquarters in late 2023.</p><p>Chevron's presence in Houston has been growing in recent years, while its footprint in California has been shrinking. The Houston office now employs nearly 6,000 people, roughly three times as many as the California headquarters, which has been declining after the company began a reorganization in 2019.</p><p>A spokesman for Chevron said the current real-estate market offers the company an opportunity to adjust its office-space needs.</p><p>Many U.S. businesses are reconsidering their headquarters' spaces as they contemplate a future of hybrid home-and-office work, and weigh the potential benefits of moving more of their operations to states with lower taxes and costs of living.</p><p>Chevron's plans to decamp from its current headquarters follow similar recent moves by several large U.S. companies, including machinery giant Caterpillar Inc., aerospace company Boeing Co., defense contractor Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Chevron's closest rival, Exxon Mobil Corp., which is moving its headquarters outside Dallas to Houston next year.</p><p>Exxon's center of gravity had drifted from Irving, Texas, to the Houston area a few years ago when it opened a campus in Spring, Texas, large enough to house 10,000 workers. In January, Exxon said it would move its headquarters to the Spring location as part of a reorganization of its businesses.</p><p>Boeing and Caterpillar recently said they would leave the Chicago area and move their headquarters to Arlington, Va., and Irving, Texas, respectively.</p><p>---</p><p>Christopher M.
