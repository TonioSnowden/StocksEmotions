  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA jumped 818 points, or 2.8%, to 29,543, after rising more than 900 points at its session high.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 100 points, or 2.8%, at 3,686.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 265 points, or 2.5%, at 10,841.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen for three consecutive quarters, off 24.8% over that time, and lost 9.3% in September, the biggest monthly decline since March 2020. On Friday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted their lowest finishes since November 2020, while the Nasdaq saw its lowest close since July 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Concerns over financial stability reverberated as a new week, trading month and quarter got under way on Monday. Investors weighed the risks of a 2008-type Lehman Brothers collapse that might trigger a broader financial crisis. The worry centered on Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse CH:CSGN CS, which saw its shares touch a record low on Monday as the cost of insuring the bank's debt against default continued to rise.

Growing warnings about a potential U.S. recession are being accompanied by renewed chatter about the possibility of a Fed pivot, suggesting a risk that investors are \"again underestimating the Fed's resolve as it seeks to tackle inflation,\" said Deustche Bank research analyst Henry Allen.</p><p>\"It is fair to say that the market is now wondering aloud if all this talk about getting inflation under wraps is something they at the Fed could adhere to in the context of a lot of stresses coming into the market,\" said Tom Porcelli, the New York-based chief U.S. economist for RBC Capital Markets. \"It's a completely fair thing for the market to wonder about. I don't want to make a lot out of one day's moves, but the commentary from people we are talking to is also a reflection of that.\" \"There's no question the Fed wants to get inflation under control,\" Porcelli said via phone on Monday. \"The bigger question is, 'Are they under autopilot until inflation moves back to a level they are comfortable with or do other factors come into play that could derail their plans?'\" Read: U.N. Calls On Fed, Other Central Banks to Halt Interest-Rate Increases</p><p>Early gains in major stock indexes were extended after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index fell to a 28-month low of 50.9% in September, or the lowest level in more than two years, as high inflation and rapidly rising U.S. interest rates began to rattle the economy. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to drop to 52% from 52.8% in August. Meanwhile, fed-funds futures traders backed away from their expectations of how high Fed policy makers will likely lift the main policy rate target in early 2023, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Fed officials have delivered five rate hikes this year, three of which were 75-basis-point moves. Traders now mostly see the fed-funds rate target getting to between 4.25% and 4.5% by December, up from a current level between 3% and 3.25%. \"The market is clearly positioning for a Fed pause after the December FOMC meeting,\" said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA Corp., referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. \"Whether it's weaker manufacturing data, more financial risks to the system that are growing, or fears that the housing market is cooling too fast, there's so much risk on the table that it may be difficult for the Fed to remain this aggressive.\" Traders and analysts said stocks were technically overdue for a short-term bounce anyway after a brutal selloff, but they still expressed caution.</p><p>Market internals are \"shot to pieces,\" with 1.7% of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 20-day moving average, 32% of companies sporting a relative strength index below 30 — signaling oversold conditions — and 35% of companies at new 4-week lows, said Chris Weston, director of research at Pepperstone, in a note.</p><p>\"This ultra-bearish sentiment plays into the risk vs. reward trade-off, and it suggests if we hear something remotely positive, and we see better flow, the result will be a pronounced equity counter-rally, which may motivate funds to reduce U.S. dollar long positions as the default equity hedge,\" he wrote.</p><p>But investors could also be in for another brutal week, Weston said, noting that \"liquidity remains a core consideration that exacerbates moves as funds try and get out of positions.\"</p><p>There was some calming news from the U.K., where a government U-turn on tax policy that had roiled equity and fixed-income markets last week helped push sovereign bond yields lower on Monday.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y declined 14 basis points to 3.656% as the equivalent duration U.K. bond BX:TMBMKGB-10Y eased 19 basis points to 3.96%.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA fell 7.5% after the electric-vehicle maker reported record quarterly deliveries on Sunday. The number still disappointed analysts.</p><p>* Oil-and-gas companies like Chevron Corp. CVX, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Marathon Energy Corp. MPC and Devon Energy Corp. DVN surged on the back of higher oil prices following reports the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, or OPEC+, would consider a large production cut at a meeting this week. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for November CLX22 delivery rose $4.14, or 5.2%, to settle at $83.63 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. .Shares of Chevron rose 5.8%. Exxon was up 5.1%, Marathon advanced 4.2%, and Devon rose 8.7%.</p><p>Read: OPEC+ could cut oil production because it's trying to halt a sharp crude selloff</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow jumps over 800 points as stocks attempt to claw back from brutal September</p>",
