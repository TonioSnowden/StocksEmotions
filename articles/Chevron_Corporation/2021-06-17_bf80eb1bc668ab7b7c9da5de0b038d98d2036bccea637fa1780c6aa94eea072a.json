  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Veteran Investment Banker Quits Credit Suisse  ---  The departure comes  as the bank deals with  losses tied to the  Archegos meltdown  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Morgan Stanley has hired longtime investment banker Greg Weinberger away from Credit Suisse Group AG, according to people familiar with the matter, the Swiss bank's highest-profile departure yet as it deals with losses tied to the meltdown of Archegos Capital Management. </p><p>   Mr. Weinberger, a Credit Suisse veteran, was most recently its global head of mergers and acquisitions. </p><p>   Credit Suisse on Wednesday tapped Steven Geller and Cathal Deasy as co-heads of global M&amp;A, some of the people said. </p><p>   The two will report to David Wah, who will become global head of advisory while continuing to lead the firm's client advisory group. </p><p>   Mr. Wah is one of the firm's most senior deal makers, having previously led several sector groups. Mr. Geller joined the firm in 1994 and has been in charge of M&amp;A in the Americas and global technology M&amp;A, while Mr. Deasy, who joined in 2016, has been leading M&amp;A in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>   Mr. Weinberger is expected to start at Morgan Stanley in the fall and continue to focus on advising clients on M&amp;A in Morgan Stanley's investment bank, the people said. </p><p>   He has historically advised clients in the oil-and-gas sector as well as other sectors such as industrials and technology. </p><p>   He advised Chevron Corp. on its proposed $33 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which Chevron later walked away from after Occidental Petroleum Corp. agreed to pay more. He advised on several recent energy deals, including Chevron's roughly $5 billion purchase of Noble Energy Inc. and Concho Resources Inc.'s roughly $10 billion sale to ConocoPhillips. </p><p>   Mr. Weinberger had been with Credit Suisse since 1996, aside from a short stint with another bank. </p><p>   More than 10 managing directors in the Swiss firm's U.S. investment-banking division have internally disclosed plans to leave, most for rival firms, and others are considering their options. Investments held by Archegos, a family investment vehicle for Bill Hwang, plummeted in late March, forcing Credit Suisse and other banks to sell large stock positions at losses. </p><p>   The woes of the bank's prime-brokerage unit, which caters to investors such as Archegos, has overshadowed an otherwise strong run for the investment bank, especially within capital markets and advisory. </p><p>   The bank has advised on large transactions lately including chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s $35 billion purchase of rival Xilinx Inc. and the $21 billion acquisition of Speedway by the Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain. </p><p></p>",
