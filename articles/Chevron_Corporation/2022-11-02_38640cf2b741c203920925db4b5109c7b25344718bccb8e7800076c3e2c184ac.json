  "title": "Business News: BP Profit Is Lifted by Natural-Gas Trading",
  "text": "<p>A big clue behind BP's trading gains came from the underlying profit in its gas and low-carbon segment, which totaled $6.2 billion in the third quarter before interest and taxes. That was more than BP's profit from the same segment in the first nine months of 2021.</p><p>High natural-gas prices have been core to Europe's energy woes, but are also producing record profits for the world's largest energy companies. As Russia's war against Ukraine rages on, an energy crisis threatens to throw the bloc into recession.</p><p>The profits are drawing political scrutiny from both sides of the Atlantic, with politicians in the U.S. calling for a windfall-profits levy on the industry similar to the one implemented in the U.K. earlier this year.</p><p>On a conference call Tuesday morning, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss resisted calls from multiple analysts to be more specific about the gas-trading profit. \"Who do you fear? Why not make that more transparent? Is it the political environment?\" Bank of America Corp. analyst Christopher Kuplent asked.</p><p>Mr. Auchincloss declined to confirm Mr. Kuplent's estimate of $3 billion from gas trading.</p><p>BP's overall third-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. Flush with cash, BP said it plans to boost its oil-and-gas production both onshore and offshore in the U.S. and the North Sea, with as many as seven new drilling rigs planned across those regions.</p><p>\"The case for a bigger, bolder windfall tax is now overwhelming,\" environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, a frequent critic of oil-company profits and expanded fossil-fuel production, said Tuesday in response to BP's earnings.</p><p>BP's earnings come after Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, last week reported around $40 billion in collective profits in the third quarter.</p><p>BP said it expects to pay around $800 million as a result of a new U.K. windfall-profits levy this year. That will be part of a projected $2.5 billion in overall 2022 taxes linked to its U.K. North Sea business, the company said.</p><p>On Monday, President Biden called on Congress to penalize oil-and-gas companies if they don't use their profits to help lower energy costs for consumers. But the proposal, which comes before next week's U.S. midterm elections, faces hurdles from lawmakers.</p><p>For the third quarter, BP said its underlying replacement-cost profit, a metric similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report, came in at $8.2 billion. That beat the $6.1 billion average projection of 29 analysts compiled by BP and the $3.3 billion it reported a year earlier.</p><p>BP's reported net result for the third quarter, which takes into account certain accounting effects related to inventory valuations amid price volatility, as well as legal costs from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and other adjustments, was a $2.2 billion loss. However, that reported result mostly reflected the accounting treatment of whipsawing natural-gas prices, and was overshadowed by the more telling $8.2 billion replacement-cost profit.</p>",
