  "title": "U.S. News: Oil Executives Deny Price Gouging --- Industry leaders blame Russia war, U.S. policies, supply-chain shortages for high gasoline prices",
  "text": "<p>The company chiefs countered that prices were driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, restrictive U.S. energy policies and supply-chain shortages slowing the industry.</p><p>\"It is experiencing severe cost inflation, a labor shortage due to three downturns in 12 years, shortages of drilling rigs, frack fleets, frack sand, steel pipe and other equipment and materials,\" said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., one of the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producers. \"We can't grow faster.\"</p><p>The hearing before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, in which the executives appeared via video links, was the latest skirmish over responsibility for pump prices that lingered at record highs throughout March.</p><p>The issue has taken on added significance ahead of congressional midterm elections in November, with polls showing many worry over how the Biden administration has overseen the economy.</p><p>The committee's Republicans sought to place blame for high prices on President Biden's energy policy, including his decision to impose a temporary pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land and his revocation of a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline to carry more oil from Canada.</p><p>\"We need to look for ways to increase our domestic production and our export capacity,\" said Rep. Morgan Griffith (R., Va.). \"We need energy policy that promotes energy security while also taking advantage of America's abundant energy resources.\"</p><p>Democrats said oil companies have an obligation to do more for Americans and threatened to revoke tax breaks they get to encourage their production.</p><p>\"Now it's time for Congress to alleviate the pain many Americans are feeling at the pump,\" said Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.). \"We have the capacity right now. The reason why your companies aren't doing it, as you freely and honestly admitted, is because you're looking at your shareholder profits.\"</p><p>Ms. DeGette challenged the executives to explain why retail gasoline prices are down 3.2% from last month, while crude futures are down more than 20% from recent highs.</p><p>The oil executives said pump prices are set by retailers, and that prices are a result of several factors including local wages and other operating costs.</p><p>\"We do not control the price of crude oil or natural gas, nor of refined products like gasoline and diesel fuel,\" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said. \"And we have no tolerance for price gouging.\"</p><p>Democrats also said the oil executives were giving priority to payouts to their shareholders over reinvesting in oil production.</p><p>They cited a survey last month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in which half of the big companies that responded said they didn't intend to increase output by more than 5% this year despite higher oil prices. Most respondents cited investor pressure as the top factor limiting their growth.</p><p>Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, said the six oil companies represented at the hearing, which also included BP PLC and Shell PLC, together issued about $40 billion in dividends last year and have executed or announced $45 billion in share buyback programs in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>\"Now that's a lot of money to shareholders but it's coming at the expense of the American people, who need you to dramatically increase production, not shareholder wealth,\" Mr. Pallone said.</p><p>Pioneer and Devon Energy Corp., whose chief executive Richard Muncrief also testified before the panel, had earlier this year reported their highest annual profits in more than a decade.</p><p>Exxon reported $23 billion and Chevron reported nearly $16 billion in net income for 2021, both their most profitable years since 2014.</p><p>---</p><p>Katy Stech Ferek contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
