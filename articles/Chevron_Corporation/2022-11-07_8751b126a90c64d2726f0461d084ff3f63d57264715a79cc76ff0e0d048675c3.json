  "title": "Frackers Say Oil  Output Slows  In Shale Patch  ----  By Benoit Morenne and Collin Eaton",
  "text": "<p>   Despite an extended streak of strong profits, shale companies are slowing their oil-field activity, keeping U.S. oil production roughly flat and offering little relief for tight global markets. </p><p>   What was expected to be a banner year for U.S. oil production has failed to materialize as creeping inflation-related costs, supply-chain snarls and disappointing well performance for some companies have coalesced to limit domestic output, executives and analysts said. </p><p>   Global oil prices averaged about $100 a barrel in the third quarter, according to Bank of Nova Scotia, and in past years such prices prompted increased shale production. This time, companies like ConocoPhillips, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Devon Energy Corp. are focused on profits instead of drilling and say there are constraints to growth. </p><p>   ConocoPhillips on Thursday reported a profit of $4.5 billion, almost double the same period last year. Pioneer recently said it netted about $2 billion, while Exxon Mobil Corp. posted a record profit of almost $20 billion, and Chevron Corp. said it earned its second-largest quarterly profit, of $11.2 billion. </p><p>   Many of the companies simultaneously lowered their projections for oil production. </p><p>   Pioneer said its wells in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico -- the most active U.S. oil field -- this year produced less oil than expected and that it was reshuffling its portfolio to generate higher returns starting in 2023. The company on average produced 352,421 barrels of oil a day in the third quarter, a slight decline from the previous quarter, it said. </p><p>   ConocoPhillips previously said overall U.S. oil production growth could rise 900,000 barrels a day this year. But spokesman Dennis Nuss said U.S. oil output growth is coming in lower than it anticipated for this year because of supply-chain bottlenecks and labor shortages. </p><p>   \"Rapidly escalating costs combined with extremely tight supply are limiting the pace of industrywide production growth,\" said Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips. </p><p>   The U.S. shale boom that upset the world's oil hegemony is losing steam just as global markets need the producers to pump more to keep up with a recovery in demand. The Biden administration has urged drillers to pick up their pace, help ease high pump prices and invest profits in growth instead of increasing shareholder dividends and buybacks. </p><p>   Lofty projections by the federal government and others for robust U.S. oil production growth in 2022 are proving overly optimistic, and doubts are emerging about how many barrels of oil shale drillers can add next year. </p><p>   In the contiguous U.S., oil production through August increased 3% since December, up 288,000 barrels a day to 9.77 million, according to the Energy Information Administration. It expected total U.S. oil output -- including Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico -- to hit 12.64 million by December, growing more than 1 million barrels a day from the same month a year earlier. It has since lowered its projection almost 500,000 barrels a day. </p><p>   Even Chevron and Exxon, the largest U.S. oil companies that enjoy scale and logistical advantages, came in on the low side of their shale production targets. Exxon recently said its oil-and-gas production in the Permian was projected to rise about 20% over last year's levels, down from its initial target of 25% growth. It attributed the recalibration to weather, facility delays and schedule adjustments. Chevron said its Permian output will come in toward the lower end of its targeted range for the year, around 700,000 barrels a day, as production levels out at a slower pace. </p><p>   Growth forecasts may fall further because many drillers have relied on wells they previously drilled but left offline for future production,  drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs. The EIA said companies tapped most of their best DUCs, after they used the wells to save money on drilling as the pandemic led to a historic oil-price collapse. That trend, combined with a gas-pipeline bottleneck in the Permian, is expected to further constrain U.S. oil production growth, the EIA said. </p><p>   Another problem for shale companies is how much oil wells are producing in the Delaware basin, the western half of the Permian that frackers drilled heavily. As the region matures, well performance is predictably deteriorating there, said Tom Loughrey, president of oil analytics firm FLOW Partners LLC. </p><p>   \"We have roughly 10 years of high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian, and less if we grow faster,\" Mr. Loughrey said. \"That's going to mean these larger companies don't grow.\" </p><p>   As companies rushed to drill, many chewed up some of their best inventory first. Now, they are left with inferior drilling spots likely to produce less oil and to cost more to bring online. </p><p>   Some companies are saying that well productivity is an issue. Pioneer said it had been disappointed with the performance of its Permian wells this year and was revising its drilling strategy. \"Well productivity isn't the same as it was three years ago,\" said Pioneer Chief Operating Officer Richard Dealy. He said oil companies have to figure out how to get more crude out of the ground with new technology over time. </p><p>   Other companies said they were satisfied with their assets' productivity. Devon, which operates mostly in the Delaware basin, said its wells there had seen 11% production growth rate year to date. </p><p>   Slowing production, combined with elevated production costs expected to persist into next year, means producers are unlikely to add much production in 2023, said James West, a senior managing director at investment firm Evercore Inc. </p><p>   Companies this year have had to deal with headwinds brought by inflation, which boosted the price of materials such as steel and casing, and labor shortages, which made hiring crews that drill and frack wells a zero-sum game, executives said. Self-imposed constraints played a role in dull production growth this year, analysts said. </p><p></p>",
