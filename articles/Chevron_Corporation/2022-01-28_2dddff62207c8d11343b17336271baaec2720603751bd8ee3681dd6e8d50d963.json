  "text": "<p>Global energy groups are under unprecedented pressure to run down their fossil fuel operations. </p> <p>The world's most influential energy body has said no more exploration is needed to meet future demand, but “supermajors” are still hunting for undiscovered oil and gas in remote regions.</p> <p>Shell drilled its first well in Namibia last month in partnership with state-owned Qatar Petroleum, sinking a shaft hundreds of kilometres offshore beneath 2,500 metres of water. On the opposite side of the continent a few weeks later, Italy's Eni drilled the first well offshore Kenya in almost eight years.</p> <p>Since the oil price collapse at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the supermajors have slashed exploration budgets just as the pressure on oil companies to cut production of hydrocarbons has increased. </p> <p>Spending on exploration by the seven majors was 9 per cent of total capital expenditure in 2020, down from 18 per cent in 2014, according to data from Bernstein Research. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7932ca2-a215-48a5-86b6-7760b5b04c90\">oil prices have recovered strongly</a>, rising to more than $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014, and although total spending is still down, drilling continues.</p> <p>“The majors are still exploring and say much less about it than they used to,” said Andrew Latham, vice-president for exploration at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “You have to be a real specialist sector watcher to know these kinds of things [because] they don't talk about it.”</p> <p>Last year, 798 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled worldwide, roughly the same number as 2020 though down from 1,256 in 2019, according to Wood Mackenzie. Latham puts most of the drop down to the pandemic and expects activity to increase this year.</p> <p>For decades the exploration division was the beating heart of an oil company. The world's most successful oil executives took pride in their ability to find crude in even the most hostile of environments and companies were judged on their capacity to replace the barrels they were pumping out of the ground.</p> <p>The growing pressure on oil companies to reduce production and shift to cleaner forms of energy has changed that calculation.</p> <p>The International Energy Agency said last May that the drop in oil and gas consumption required to achieve net zero global emissions by 2050 meant no new oil or natural gas fields were required beyond those already approved for development.</p> <p>The forecast rippled around the industry, with some activists arguing for a complete end to exploration.</p> <p>All the supermajors — BP, Chevron, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalEnergies and ConocoPhillips — have made varying degrees of commitment to cut emissions by 2050. Achieving those targets will require some huge reductions in production.</p> <p>However, the continued exploration activity, particularly in countries such as Namibia with no history of oil production and no oil infrastructure, suggests many of the companies foresee strong demand for decades to come.</p> <p>Latham estimated that exploratory wells such as these, if successful, take at least six years to bring into production, with developers unlikely to recoup their costs until the mid-2030s.</p> <p>“That tells you quite a bit about what the participants think about medium- to long-term demand for oil and gas,” he said.</p> <p>Under most forecasts, oil consumption will rise until at least the middle of this decade. Producer cartel Opec believes demand can still increase another 10 per cent to roughly 109m barrels a day in 2040 before plateauing.</p> <p>Shell has said it needs to discover new oilfields to maintain production levels, even as it allows its total output to fall 1 to 2 per cent a year in line with its pivot to greener forms of energy. The UK-headquartered group has said it will continue to explore in frontier regions until 2025.</p> <p>The company said the Namibian project continued “to meet well objectives” but declined to comment further. </p> <p>Eni, which discovered 2bn barrels of oil and at least 1.8tn cubic feet of associated gas off Ivory Coast last September in the year's most significant find, said exploration was still needed to offset the natural decline from existing fields. It added that current high prices for oil and gas were “a clear example of what happens when supply cannot meet demand”.</p> <p>BP has said it will not enter any new countries for exploration but will continue to look for oil and gas in its “core regions”. </p> <p>One argument some oil executives make in favour of new projects is that, as oil wells age, it often becomes harder and more carbon-intensive to extract the remaining crude. Developing the right kind of new deposit, they argue, can be better for the environment than continuing to sweat old assets. </p> <p>Many oil companies are also betting that demand for natural gas will outlast that for oil, and are focusing on areas with deposits of both such as Egypt, where BP and Eni secured new exploration licences this month. Gas represented 60 per cent of all discoveries last year, according to Wood Mackenzie data. </p> <p>“The appetite for natural gas remains superstrong in these companies,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein.</p> <p>Ultimately, this means the supermajors are just being more selective, participating in fewer licensing rounds but still drilling where they believe there is a high chance of success, said Aatisha Mahajan at Rystad Energy. </p> <p>“Companies are trying to drill their high-ranked prospects irrespective of whether they are in frontier or mature regions,” she said, noting Shell's announcement last month of a significant discovery in the US Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Buoyed by Shell and Eni's finds, the supermajors led the exploration pack last year, discovering new resources equivalent to roughly 4.7bn barrels of oil or 40 per cent of global finds, according to Wood Mackenzie. </p> <p>Latham said he saw no evidence of oil executives worrying about the possibility of wasting exploration dollars on resources that might be left in the ground if the world starts to consume less crude.</p> <p>“What I hear more of at the moment is companies looking at the successes of their competitors and wishing they were in there,” he said.</p><p>Source: Tom Wilson in London 2022 'Oil and gas groups keep drilling despite green energy push' FT.com 28 January.
