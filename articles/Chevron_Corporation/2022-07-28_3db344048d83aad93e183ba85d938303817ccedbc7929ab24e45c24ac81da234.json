  "title": "Shell Posts Record Quarterly Profit on Soaring Energy Prices; Oil major boosted by scramble for gas, refined products",
  "text": "<p>Shell's results are the latest sign of a recovery in the fortunes of the world's largest oil companies, which saw demand decimated by the outbreak of Covid in early 2020. As the pandemic took its toll, travel plummeted and weak demand led Shell and its peers to write down tens of billions of dollars in assets on expectations of sustained lower oil and gas prices.</p><p>Now, the same multinational companies are swimming in cash, as travel and manufacturing have roared back and demand for natural gas and fuel outstrips supplies. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to the energy shortage, particularly in Europe where countries are quickly trying to replace declining gas flows via pipelines from Russia.</p><p>Shell's second-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis—a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $16.7 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the year-ago period when performance was on the rebound.</p><p>Adjusted earnings, which strip out certain commodity-price adjustments and one-time charges, came in at $11.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for the quarter. Shell said it would buy back another $6 billion in shares by its third-quarter results, on top of $8.5 billion in buybacks in the first half, while also reducing its net debt.</p><p>The record earnings and increase in shareholder returns is a far cry from April 2020 when Shell cut its dividend for the first time in 80 years. Two months later it wrote down the value of its assets by as much as $22 billion and swung to a historic loss.</p><p>Record energy prices have gone a long way to blunt the pain felt by Shell and other companies, including BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp., from their decisions to pull back from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>However, bumper profits for the major oil companies this year have also resulted in criticism from officials in Europe and the U.S. at a time when consumers are feeling the pain of higher prices when heating their homes or filling up at gas stations.</p><p>Exxon and Chevron Corp. are also expected to report another extremely profitable quarter on Friday, with BP set to announce results next week.</p><p>Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>Shell Posts Record Quarterly Profit on Soaring Energy Prices</p>",
