  "text": "<p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CL.1 CL00 CLX22 rose $1.10, or 1.4%, to $77.81 a barrel. WTI on Monday posted the lowest finish for a front-month contract since Jan. 3.</p><p>* November Brent crude BRNX22, the global benchmark, was up $1.28, or 1.5%, at $85.34 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. December Brent BRN00 BRNZ22 rose $1.27, or 1.5%, to $84.13 a barrel.</p><p>* Back on Nymex, October gasoline RBV22 rose 1.7% to $2.425 a gallon, while October heating oil HOV22 was up 2.7% at $3.213 a gallon.</p><p>* October natural gas NGV22 gained 2% to $3.212 per million British thermal units.</p><p>Market drivers</p><p>Hurricane Ian strengthened, lashing the western tip of Cuba, as it proceeded on a path that could see it make landfall on Florida's western coast. Chevron Corp. CVX and BP PLC UK:BP BP on Monday said they had shut in production at some Gulf of Mexico platforms as they braced for the hurricane, according to news reports.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.5% after hitting a 20-year high on Monday. The dollar's surge versus major rivals has taken a toll on commodities, stocks and other assets perceived as risky. The dollar's rally comes as investors fear aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will lead to a sharp global slowdown that will crimp demand for crude.</p><p>Meanwhile, the oil selloff could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to curb output when they hold their monthly meeting on Oct. 5, analysts said.</p><p>\"The group will likely be getting uneasy with the degree of weakness that we have seen in the market and so there is the very real possibility that we see OPEC+ announce supply cuts in order to support the market,\" said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, in a note.</p><p>\"Clearly though, if we are to see cuts, they will need to be quite a bit larger than the 100,000 barrels a day agreed at the last meeting in order to have a meaningful impact on the market,\" he said.</p><p>Oil bounces off 8-month low as Hurricane Ian curbs Gulf production</p>",
