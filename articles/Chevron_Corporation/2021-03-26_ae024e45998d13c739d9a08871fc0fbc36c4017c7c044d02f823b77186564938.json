  "text": "<p>The 120-mile Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, is a vital route for tankers carrying oil and natural gas. About one-tenth of the world's seaborne oil trade flowed through it and the associated Sumed -- or Suez-Mediterranean -- pipeline in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Amid expectations that the blockage could take days to clear, brokers said some shippers are seeking replacements for deliveries that used to transit through the Suez.</p><p>At least one U.S. export of liquefied-natural-gas appears to have been rerouted in the North Atlantic toward South Africa's Cape of Good Hope, away from its previous heading toward Suez, consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said in a note Thursday, citing ship-tracking data.</p><p>Similarly, one large Asian buyer already has diverted an LNG cargo to go around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the risk of getting stuck in the congestion, a trader said.</p><p>Sailing around the southern tip of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal can add 15 days and costs of $450,000 to the voyage, Mr. Singh said. As a result, vessels already close to the canal appear to be sticking to their plans, he said.</p><p>The operators of Sumed have approached traders whose tankers are stuck at the mouth of the waterway, offering to pump their oil though the pipeline, according to a trader and an Egyptian official. That pipeline is normally used by supertankers too big to transit the canal, and is more expensive, but the pipeline's operators hope the prospect of delays or a costly rerouting around Africa could make it more attractive. Sumed didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>Braemar estimates the equivalent of two million barrels a day of crude and refined oil products are stuck at the canal -- about 2% of global oil consumption.</p><p>Companies including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp. are among those who have chartered vessels stuck, according to commodities-data company Kpler. Shell and Chevron declined to comment.</p><p>Oil traders said the disruption to supplies could be a problem for refineries in the Mediterranean that buy on the spot market for immediate delivery, increasing costs and, depending on the length of disruption, potentially becoming a security of supply issue.</p><p>An executive at one big lubricants company said his firm already had started buying oil products on the open market at a premium because of delays. If the situation continues for a few days, higher costs will likely challenge some in the industry, he added.</p><p>The cost of some products already has risen because of the disruption. For instance, the Suez is a key route for cargoes of naphtha -- a liquid hydrocarbon used to make petrochemicals -- sailing to manufacturers in China, Japan and South Korea. With some naphtha cargoes now stuck, \"Asian buyers are already panicking,\" a trader said, adding that the premium for delivery in Asia over Europe had risen sharply in recent days.</p><p>Despite the disruption, the Brent international oil benchmark traded down 4% Thursday. Analysts said concerns about the impact of the Suez blockage were outstripped by hefty supplies built up during the pandemic.</p><p>---</p><p>Summer Said and Joe Wallace contributed to this article.</p>",
