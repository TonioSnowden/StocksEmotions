  "title": "U.S. Crude Oil Price Falls Below $80 a Barrel; Potential production increases, China's stalled reopening and a gloomy economic outlook weigh on prices",
  "text": "<p>At the same time, investors expect ongoing interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve—potentially sending the U.S. into a recession—despite data suggesting that inflation is beginning to weaken from 40-year highs.</p><p>Those factors have weighed on prices, analysts say, even as Washington is set to conclude its release of strategic petroleum reserves—a move Wall Street expects to support oil.</p><p>\"The Fed and the Chinese have both thrown cold water on those optimistic hopes,\" said Robert Yawger, executive director for energy futures at Mizuho Securities. \"For inflation, this is a good thing.\"</p><p>Oil futures fell further Monday afterThe Wall Street Journal reported that the Saudi-led consortium OPEC+ was considering boosting production by up to 500,000 barrels a day at its Dec. 4 meeting. An output increase would help offset potential losses of Russian supplies as the Kremlin responds to a growing web of Western energy sanctions set to expand next month.</p><p>Contracts to deliver West Texas Intermediate crude next month have lost 19% in the past two weeks and fell to $75.90 a barrel in morning trading Monday, their lowest level since the beginning of January, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Brent crude, the global gauge, fell about 5% Monday to $82.79, its lowest intraday value since Jan. 11.</p><p>WTI's retreat dragged oil prices back below where they were before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. Economic fallout from the conflict helped push up the cost for products such as diesel and gasoline, providing a windfall to energy producers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. and their investors. The S&amp;P 500 energy sector has added around 60% this year, even as the broader index has lost 17%.</p><p>The recent decline in oil prices has stalled some of those gains, with the sector losing 3.7% Monday, the worst performance among the index's groups. Shares in Diamondback Energy Inc. fell 7%, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co. declined 4.9%. EOG Resources Inc. slipped 4.5%.</p><p>On Friday, the price of U.S. crude delivered in December slipped below the price of a barrel delivered in January, a dynamic some commodities traders see as a warning of additional weakness ahead. Lower near-term prices encourage suppliers to store crude instead of selling it, in hopes it will fetch more later. Such pileups tend to be sticky, suggesting a surplus that could weigh on prices in the future.</p><p>Still, some analysts still expect China's gradual reopening and forthcoming tightening of supplies will push up prices next year.</p><p>An increase in production by OPEC+, which has cut its forecast for oil demand, could help stem losses from Russian barrels coming off the global market. Delegates for the group are slated to meet a day before the European Union is set to ban most imports of Russian crude in a move that some analysts expect will weigh down the country's production.</p><p>Despite the recent volatility, some Wall Street analysts still expect prices to rise next year. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note that China's eventual reopening and expected production cuts from Russia will help Brent crude reach $110 a barrel in 2023.</p><p>\"We think that the oil market will tighten further, supporting higher prices,\" he said.</p><p>—Bob Henderson contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Crude Oil Price Falls Below $80 a Barrel</p>",
