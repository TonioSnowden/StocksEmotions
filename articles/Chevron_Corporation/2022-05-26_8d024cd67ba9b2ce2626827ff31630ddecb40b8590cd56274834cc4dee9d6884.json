Thanks for reading.</p> <p><em>Myles</em></p> <h1>US LNG takes another step forward</h1> <p>Another slug of American fossil fuels is ready to come to Europe's rescue. </p> <p>Just months after starting up its Calcasieu Pass liquefied natural gas plant on the Louisiana coast, Venture Global LNG has taken a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef4a6f6d-5bb7-4760-8992-a8cdcd065574\">final investment decision to build another $13bn facility at Plaquemines</a>, close to New Orleans.</p> <p>Plaquemines will begin shipping in 2024, Venture Global's chief executive Mike Sabel told me yesterday. Initial sanctioned capacity will be 13mn tonnes a year, rising to 20mn t/y later. LNG projects often take at least five years to build, exposing many developers to supply chain risk and cost inflation. But Venture Global believes it has cracked a different, speedier model, as it rolls out dozens of identical liquefaction “trains” — as the units that liquefy the gas are called — for use in its plants. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“We're building identical liquefaction trains at Plaquemines that were already successfully built in a factory for Calcasieu Pass,” said Sabel. “We had 18 trains for Calcasieu Pass and these are trains 19 through 36 for Plaquemines . . . We aren't delivering raw material to a site and custom stick-building giant liquefaction trains, we're rolling them through factories.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Also helping the pace is that the company “secretly” started building Plaquemines last August, even before the sudden surge in global LNG prices and anxieties in Europe about energy security.</p> <p>All told, Venture Global reckons it can eventually hit LNG export capacity of 70mn tonnes a year — almost double current US capacity. </p> <p>This makes Venture Global central to US efforts to help the EU wean itself off Russian gas. As a reminder, in March, Joe Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan for the US to help secure another 15bn cubic metres (about 11mn tonnes) of LNG for Europe this year. As part of the agreement, Europe would guarantee demand for another 50bn cu metres of US LNG over the longer term. </p> <p>“That's largely Venture Global,” Sabel said. Calcasieu Pass was providing the extra gas this year, and its other plants would help meet the longer-term target as they come on line in the coming years. “We are the only swing capacity available in the US of any scale,” he said.</p> <p>Almost all of the 15 cargoes shipped from Calcasieu Pass since it launched this year have gone to Europe, Sabel added, even though much of the gas had been bought by Asian utilities. “They diverted them to help Europe,” Sabel said. </p> <p>Beyond Venture Global, the US has plenty of new capacity waiting in the wings. Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi expansion in Texas is likely to be the next project to get a final investment decision, reckons Jason Gabelman, a director at Cowen. Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana may follow, while its Port Arthur (Texas again) project moved a step closer yesterday when Sempra announced a new supply deal with Germany's RWE. Meanwhile, cranes are already busily installing another plant, ExxonMobil and QatarEnergy's Golden Pass, in south-eastern Texas. </p> <p>Cowen calculates that the US has total export capacity of 151mn t/y, almost twice current operating capacity, if all the projects that are sanctioned or planned — but not yet fully financed — go ahead. </p> <p>That's a tall order. At current rates, LNG development is running at almost $1bn per million tonnes of capacity, say insiders. The bankers will need long-term take-or-pay contracts before they stump up the costly project financing. </p> <p>Sabel said the Biden administration — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/048ea270-cdd8-4c77-a8d4-0c67e2f9b921\">now so focused on expanding fossil fuel production to salve short-term energy security worries</a> — was increasingly supportive of more LNG, with a speedier approvals process helping push construction ahead. </p> <p>“We've seen very constructive support from the regulators here in the US,” he said. “We've seen the fastest approvals in years . . . [from] the human beings that actually do the [approvals] work and the job, see the global crisis in Europe, and are sincere and earnest and trying to do good work and play an important role and helping to get the supply to market.”</p> <p>Crucially, financiers have also grown more confident in gas's long-term future, he said. The energy security crisis in Europe, coupled with hopes that gas could replace more carbon-intensive coal in making electricity, had renewed even European banks' enthusiasm for the fossil fuel, he said. </p> <p>“I think the majority of the banks and bankers understand that LNG and natural gas is key to their emissions goals and you need to have more gas to abate coal,” he said. </p> <p>But others are less sure. Although coal-to-gas switching has helped drive down emissions in the UK and US, some <a href=\"https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/3303/\">academics challenge</a> that it can be repeated so easily elsewhere. And environmental groups are increasingly working to stall more US LNG development. </p> <p>And while Plaquemines had succeeded in securing enough customers for its fast-build plants, the main hurdle to further development along the Gulf remained the mixed longer-term outlook for LNG, said Gabelman. </p> <p>The short-term demand in Europe triggered by the Russia-Ukraine crisis had sparked huge new interest in contracts, he said. But it may not endure given the continent's commitment to a longer-term transition away from fossil fuels. </p> <p>“The issues with these projects is getting customers to sign up,” Gabelman said. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“It's clear that Asia customers want long-term LNG supply. But with Europe, it's a bit less straightforward because they're looking for gas supply in the near term, but they ultimately want to transition away from gas to a cleaner fuel source. And that's where some of the tension is.”</p> </blockquote> <p><em>(Derek Brower)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Elevated European gas prices continue to draw all available LNG cargoes to the continent — but rising Asian spot prices could soon divert molecules east, analysts say. </p> <p>Benchmark TTF prices in Europe have slid from more than $30 per million British thermal units this month to just over $26/mn btu. The Asian marker JKM sat around $22/mn btu yesterday. </p> <p>“All factors remaining constant — such as no further cuts in Russian gas to Europe — we may see a rebalance of LNG vessels away from the [European] region, which has become a black hole for LNG, drawing in all and every available cargo,” said Lu Ming Pang, an analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Given that prices for LNG cargoes in the Atlantic and the Pacific have been within touching distance, if a price premium emerges in the Pacific that outweighs the increase in shipping fees of cargoes into the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, sellers might be enticed to move ships there instead.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>TotalEnergies is bulking up its clean energy portfolio, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5149ac6-ef18-45e1-90a9-2cb1e7a83d97\">acquiring half of wind and solar developer Clearway</a>.
