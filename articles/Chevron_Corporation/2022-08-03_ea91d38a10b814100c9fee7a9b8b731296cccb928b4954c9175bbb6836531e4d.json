  "title": "Business News: Key Earnings Metric Increases at BP",
  "text": "<p>The world's biggest energy companies are awash with cash as economies have roared back from the pandemic and demand for natural gas and fuel outstrips supplies. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to the energy shortage, particularly in Europe, where countries are quickly trying to replace declining gas flows delivered via pipelines from Russia.</p><p>BP's results come after Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, last week banked a record $46 billion in collective profits in the second quarter. Historically high margins on fuel refining are following cutbacks in global fuel-making capacity during Covid-19 lockdowns, when travel and manufacturing slowed, sapping demand.</p><p>The major oil companies have used part of those big profits to reward shareholders. For the second quarter, BP increased its dividend by 10% and said it is on track for planned annual dividend increases of about 4% through 2025. The company said it would buy back another $3.5 billion in shares by third-quarter results, on top of $3.9 billion in buybacks during the first half of this year.</p><p>Shares in BP closed up 2.8% in London.</p><p>Major oil companies have faced political heat in Europe and the U.S. over bumper profits while consumers are shouldering the pain of higher prices for heating their homes or filling up at gas stations. Oil-company executives have said that soaring profits from traditional businesses are helping them invest in lower-carbon projects as they transition to renewable energy, but those parts of their businesses -- and profits generated by them -- remain small.</p><p>Environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, a frequent critic of oil-company profits and expanded fossil-fuel production, said BP's results Tuesday show that government officials need to go further in raising taxes on oil-and-gas companies to help consumers with soaring living costs.</p><p>The big oil companies have been boosting returns to shareholders, largely favoring increases in dividends and share buybacks over significantly increasing spending on oil-and-gas production. Their conservative spending reflects in part predictions by many economists of a recession that would hit fuel demand, with an anticipated slowdown already showing in futures prices for oil and gasoline.</p><p>Tuesday's results show that BP has emerged on solid ground after reporting a loss for the first quarter of the year tied to the company's decision to exit its Russia holdings. BP took a $25.5 billion pretax accounting charge related to the exit, including its stake in government-controlled oil producer Rosneft. That charge, the biggest hit tallied by companies pulling back from Russia, dragged BP to a $20.4 billion headline loss for the first quarter. But the company said at the time that the loss didn't change its strategy or curtail its plans to distribute cash to investors while reducing debt.</p><p>For the second quarter, the company said its strong oil trading performance had been partially offset by lower natural-gas profits, hurt by an extended outage at the Freeport liquefied natural-gas shipping facility in Texas. That outage is causing a \"significant reduction\" in LNG cargoes that BP said it is receiving from the site.</p><p>Europe's race to fill its natural-gas storage supplies ahead of winter has led companies including Shell and BP to cut back on their own gas usage. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said last week that Shell has reduced by 40% or more its natural-gas input to refineries and chemical plants in the Netherlands and Germany.</p><p>BP CEO Bernard Looney said in an interview Tuesday that BP has reduced its gas usage at European refineries by 50% in recent months, so far without hurting production.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
