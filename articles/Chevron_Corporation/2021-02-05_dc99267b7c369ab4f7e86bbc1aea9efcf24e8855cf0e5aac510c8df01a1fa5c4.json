  "text": "<h2>BUY: Frontier Developments&#xa0;(FDEV)</h2> <p>Video gaming specialists can count themselves among the canon of pandemic-resistant companies, <em>writes Emma Powell.</em></p> <p>Frontier Developments&#xa0;has performed well during the first half. Additional in-game content, growth in the player base and new platform releases for&#xa0;<em>Planet Coaster</em>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<em>Jurassic World Evolution</em>&#xa0;meant the group was able to generate a 15 per cent rise in revenue despite no new title launches.</p> <p>A reduction in distribution costs and a greater proportion of revenue being generated from its own intellectual property titles offset a rise in development costs, boosting the operating margin to 19 per cent, a&#xa0;five percentage point increase&#xa0;from the prior half year.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The group was not completely immune from the impact of the pandemic — the challenges of collaborative working during lockdown caused management to push back the PlayStation and Xbox releases of its next major launch,&#xa0;<em>Elite Dangerous: Odyssey</em>, to 2022. However, management has retained guidance for revenue of between £90m and £95m this year, which would result in an increase of up to a quarter on the full-year 2020 figure.&#xa0;</p> <p>To what extent will the pace of demand continue past the pandemic? “There has been a transition and lockdown has merely accelerated that,” argued chief executive David Braben.&#xa0;</p> <p>Frontier has a strong record of generating sales growth from existing games, which, given the lower associated development costs, bodes well for future returns. What's more, spending in the global video games market is expected to grow, rising 9 per cent in 2020 and at a compound annual rate of 8 per cent until 2023, according to games research provider Newzoo. Frontier's forward price/earnings multiple of 49 could prove worth stumping up for.</p> <h2>SELL: BP (BP.)</h2> <p>BP&#xa0;reported another weak quarter at the end of 2020 even as oil prices recovered to over $50 (£37) a barrel, <em>writes Alex Hamer.</em> </p> <p>Earnings were hit by lower margins and demand in its downstream business. The energy major's overall numbers for 2020 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d89f65d1-0c73-4575-aa11-8e770f8d90bd\">were down</a> on analyst expectations, with a replacement cost (RC) loss —&#xa0;BP's preferred profit metric —&#xa0;of $18bn, compared to a $3.5bn profit in 2019.&#xa0;</p> <p>Upstream production was down 10 per cent on 2019 to 2.4m barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), at an average oil price of $38 per barrel (bbl). Upstream costs were down 7 per cent on 2019, the company said.&#xa0;</p> <p>BP crept into positive territory in the December quarter on the RC profit measure, however, reaching $115m, though this was well adrift of analyst expectations of $380m.</p> <p>The group said the December quarter profit had been hit by “a significantly weaker result in gas marketing and trading and higher exploration write-offs”. Rosneft was the only bright spot in the quarter, registering an underlying RC profit of $311m, compared to consensus estimates of $170m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Jefferies analyst Giacomo Romeo said organic free cash&#xa0;falling into a $700m outflow was the “main reason for disappointment”, as consensus expectations pointed to a positive flow of $1.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The quarterly dividend rate was maintained. But&#xa0;investors won't see an uptick in the payout until the group gets net debt — excluding leases — down to $35bn, when buybacks will begin. Net debt was $39bn at the end of 2020, well down on the end of 2019 largely because of $12bn in hybrid debt issued during the year, which lands on the equity side of the balance sheet.&#xa0;Finance chief Murray Auchincloss said the $35bn target would likely be hit at the end of 2021 or start of 2022. This measure will probably climb in the first half of the year&#xa0;given redundancy payments and other one-offs.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Looking beyond the numbers, chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/9a9b0cf1-134d-437b-9eca-e6e0e9ed4664\">Bernard Looney</a> said 2020 had been a “pivotal” year for BP. It&#xa0;announced a major shift in spending strategy in 2020 that will see its production and carbon footprint come down, although underlying upstream production will grow in 2021, the company said on Tuesday. It will fall on a reported, or absolute, basis because of asset sales.&#xa0;The group is also&#xa0;around half way through its plan to cut around 10,000 jobs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Production commenced at four major projects in 2020, and the group sold off its petrochemicals business. It also completed the sale of its Alaskan assets. This divestment programme has already seen another major sale in 2021. BP announced this week it would sell 20 per cent of the Block 61 asset in Oman for $2.6bn, to Thai state company PTT Exploration and ‎‎Production Public Company.</p> <p>Mr Looney tried to assuage investor concerns over profits falling because of the new strategy.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We expect to grow Ebitda out to 2025,” Mr Looney said on an investor call. He said expected higher margins, cost cuts and a “high-graded” portfolio would make this possible.&#xa0;</p> <p>The BP chief executive also said he was looking forward to working with new US president Joe Biden, who has promised to ban oil and gas leases on federal land. Mr Looney said this would affect less than 1 per cent of BP's US holdings. The chief executive said licensing would come up for some Gulf of Mexico assets in a year or two.&#xa0;</p> <p>According to Jefferies, BP has the most recoverable pre-development reserves in the Gulf of Mexico of&#xa0;the majors, at around 800mbbls. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB), which reports its 2020 numbers on Thursday, has just over 700mbbls, while Chevron has around 600mbbls.&#xa0;</p> <h2>HOLD: Vodafone&#xa0;(VOD)</h2> <p>Shares in Vodafone rose more than 4 per cent on release of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e2ec09e-91fc-4834-8627-90706f82c671\">third-quarter figures</a>, <em>writes Harriet Clarfelt</em>.</p> <p>Telecoms company&#xa0;Vodafone&#xa0;has returned to service revenue growth after two quarters of pandemic-induced declines, buoyed by improvements in its biggest market Germany. &#xa0;</p> <p>The FTSE 100 group said on Wednesday that lockdowns had prompted greater reliance on its networks, taking data traffic to unprecedented levels. At the same time, the blow to roaming revenues was smaller than endured in previous periods as Covid-19 scuppered international travel.</p> <p>Organic service revenue rose 0.4 per cent to €9.4bn for the third quarter ending December 31, with Germany up 1 per cent to €2.9bn and the group's Vodacom business up 3.3 per cent to €1.1bn. By comparison, total organic service revenue dipped 0.4 per cent in the second quarter and 1.3 per cent in the first.</p> <p>Vodafone reiterated its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted cash profits to land between €14.4bn-€14.6bn with free cash flow of at least €5bn before factoring in spectrum and restructuring costs. The group added that the anticipated initial public offering of Vantage Towers, its masts business, is on track for early 2021. The IPO&#xa0;will take place in Frankfurt; an unsurprising choice of location while Germany comprises an increasing proportion of the group's sales following the acquisition of various Liberty Global assets.</p> <p>Shares in Vodafone have fallen roughly a tenth over the past 12 months. </p> <h2>Chris Dillow: The vanished deficit</h2> <p>One under-appreciated economic effect of Covid-19 is that it has eliminated the UK's trade deficit. </p> <p>This has not happened because we've enjoyed a revival of competitiveness or entrepreneurial spirits. In fact, in the third quarter, export volumes were 17.9 per cent down on a year ago. Instead, it's because Covid has made us spend less. In the second quarter of last year households&#xa0;saved&#xa0;26.5 per cent of their disposable income — by far an all-time record. Although this proportion fell in the third quarter, it remained far above its long-term average.</p> <p>It's not just households who have saved more, though. So have companies. Yes, countless firms have seen revenues slump. But many have also postponed capital spending. The upshot is that, in aggregate, non-financial firms' retained profits have&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/bulletins/quarterlysectoraccounts/julytoseptember2020\" title=\"\">exceeded&#xa0;</a>their investment — by 1.4 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of last year.</p> <p>This forced slump in spending has caused a slump in imports and hence a trade surplus.</p> <p>We can put this another way. Every pound lent must be a pound borrowed. If the private sector is a net lender — with their savings exceeding their investment — somebody else must be a net borrower. For the most part, this somebody else is the government, whose borrowing has soared. But it is also foreigners: their lending to the UK has declined. Latest figures show that in the last six months the UK's current account&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/timeseries/aa6h/ukea\" title=\"\">deficit&#xa0;</a>(the amount we borrow from overseas) was under three per cent of GDP, one of the smallest deficits in the last 10 years.</p> <p>This might matter. Large, sustained borrowing from overseas — which is rare because financial markets don't led as much to countries as you might imagine — can be a warning sign of financial crises. In the run-up to the euro zone crisis southern Europe countries ran large current account deficits, as did the US before the 2007-8 crisis. There's a reason for this. If people are investing more than they are saving it might be because they are over-optimistic about future growth. It's also a sign that banks' balance sheets are becoming more fragile, as their loans grow faster than their deposits. On both counts, the risk of crisis rises.</p> <p>In this sense, the dark cloud of the pandemic has a silver lining. It has improved domestic balance sheets and so reduced the chance of a crisis.</p> <p>There is, of course, a massive caveat here. All this is true in aggregate. It is emphatically not true of everybody. Many workers have suffered redundancy or cuts in hours and have borrowed more: it's just that they are outnumbered by forced savers. And many companies are teetering on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>The story of 2021 will be a story of how these very different experiences play out. Will the release of pent-up demand among consumers and firms cause a mini-boom? Or will rising unemployment and corporate failures hold back growth? It is dangerous to bet only on the former. There's a limit to how much aggregate economic data can tell us.</p> <p><em>Chris Dillow is an economics commentator for Investors' Chronicle</em> </p><p>Source: Emma Powell, Alex Hamer and Harriet Clarfelt, Investors’ Chronicle 2021 'Investors' Chronicle: Frontier Developments, BP, Vodafone' FT.com 5 February.
