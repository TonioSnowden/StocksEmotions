  "text": "<p>While the effect of Dobbs, which overturned Roe v. Wade, may well be to reduce the availability of abortion services, the outcome is that the searingly divisive social issue should be determined by legislative bodies rather than by unelected judges. Similarly, while many accuse the justices in West Virginia of closing their eyes to climate change, the court actually decided that unless Congress expressly delegates to administrative agencies the power to adopt policies that would work major economic or social changes, that power must remain with Congress itself.</p><p>Both are landmark decisions—just not for the reasons that their loudest supporters and critics proclaim.</p><p>Kenneth A. Margolis</p><p>Chappaqua, N.Y.</p><p>Your editorial discusses the Democrats' abuse of textualism by indicating that they first claim the statutory language is ambiguous, and then use the Chevron doctrine to validate a radical interpretation.
