  "title": "Icahn Sells Off Occidental Stake  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Carl Icahn exited from a big bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., selling the last of what was once a roughly 10% stake in the oil-and-gas producer as its shares surge. </p><p>   Mr. Icahn, who had been cutting the position, in recent days sold the remainder of it, according to a letter he sent to Occidental's board Sunday. The move brings to a close one of Mr. Icahn's most dramatic recent clashes, which began when he criticized Occidental for outbidding larger rival Chevron Corp. to strike a $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in May 2019. </p><p>   The activist investor's two representatives on Occidental's board are also resigning, he said in the letter, as was required by a settlement agreement with the company at the onset of the pandemic. </p><p>   Occidental's shares plummeted in March 2020, allowing Mr. Icahn to increase the investment, boosting his stake from 2.5% to around 10%. By that time, he had been arguing for almost a year that the Anadarko deal was an ill-conceived defensive move and campaigning for the ouster of Chief Executive Vicki Hollub. He also took issue with the $10 billion of pricey financing from Warren Buffett that Occidental relied on to pay for the deal. </p><p>   Mr. Buffett has been buying Occidental shares in recent days. As of Friday, Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported owning roughly $5 billion worth. </p><p>   Within weeks of Mr. Icahn's raising his stake, he and Occidental called a truce that brought back former CEO Stephen Chazen as chairman and added three directors, including Mr. Icahn's two representatives. Ms. Hollub remained CEO, and the company announced deep cost cuts. </p><p>   Mr. Icahn thanked Mr. Chazen in Sunday's letter, including for supporting his push to issue a free dividend of warrants that he said created over $4 billion of value for Occidental shareholders. </p><p>   \"While we certainly had our disagreements with Vicki Hollub concerning M&amp;A, we thank her for using her well-honed operating skills and resiliency so well in Occidental's darkest hours,\" Mr. Icahn wrote. \"We believe our relationship with Occidental turned out to be activism at its best.\" </p><p>   With the help of a surge in oil prices, Occidental's shares have more than quintupled after sinking below $10 in 2020. They closed Friday at $56.15, just below where they were before the Anadarko deal was completed. </p><p>   Mr. Icahn realized a profit of around $1 billion on the investment, according to people familiar with the matter. He also has an unrealized net profit of roughly $500 million on the warrants, they said. He said in the letter that he still owns over 15 million warrants. </p><p></p>",
