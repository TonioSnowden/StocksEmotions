  "text": "<p><strong>JD Sports</strong> is doubling down in the US, with the sportswear specialist announcing a big expansion of its store fleet across the pond. </p> <p>The company said it has agreed a $495m deal to buy DTLR Villa, a “hyperlocal athletic footwear and apparel streetwear retailer” based in Baltimore, Maryland. Private equity-owned DLTR operates 247 stores across 19 states, principally in the north and east of the US.</p> <p>“The attractions of the business include its connection to the black urban community with 70 per cent of locations on the street, which differs from Finish Line, which is mall-based,” said Investec analyst Kate Calvert. “This is another attractive bolt-on acquisition in the US, which helps build scale in different locations to Finish Line.”</p> <p>JD Sports already operates more than 500 stores in the US moved into the market through the 2018 acquisition of Finish Line for $558m, with the group also buying California-based&#xa0;Shoe Palace for $325m last in December.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> reported assets under administration up 16 per cent to £120.6bn in 2020. Fiscal half-year results to December from the fund supermarket showed profit before tax rising 10 per cent to £188.4m, with the interim dividend hiked 6 per cent to 11.9p per share. Trading in January “has been similar to other lockdown periods with strong dealing volumes, significant client engagement and robust net new business and net new client numbers,” but “things become less certain” after the end of the UK tax year, Hargreaves said. &#xa0; </p> <p><strong>Asos</strong> confirmed the purchase of flagship brands from the administrator of Arcadia, Philip Green's failed retail empire, for £265m. Asos said its agreement to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT was “a compelling strategic opportunity in support of our mission to become the number one destination for fashion loving 20-somethings worldwide”. The company said the four brands delivered approximately £265m in total revenue last year and flagged around £20m of transaction costs. </p> <p><strong>Supreme</strong>, the Manchester-based wholesaler of vaping liquids and e-cigarette batteries, said it had raised £67.5m with a “comfortably oversubscribed” share sale at 134p apiece. The stock starts trading on Aim today with a debut market value of £156m.</p> <p><strong>S4 Capital</strong>, Martin&#xa0;Sorrell's digital advertising start-up, announced a deal to buy the assets of Datalicious, a data analytics business owned by credit checking agency Equifax. No terms were given.</p> <p>Gambling technology company <strong>Sportech</strong> said it has sold Bump Worldwide, its digital raffle division, to Canadian Bank Note Company, for a price equivalent to £5.7m. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Retail traders have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d46e8623-09af-4a1f-b7e5-207616388b0f\">targeted the silver market</a> following their successful attack against short-sellers of games retailer <strong>GameStop</strong>. The world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, the iShares Silver Trust, recorded almost $1bn in inflows on Friday, according to data from BlackRock, the fund's sponsor. Meanwhile, assets held by hedge fund <strong>Melvin Capital</strong> lost <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa74a7c6-bcb0-469e-8b76-c5dfc04b9564\">53 per cent of their value in January</a> after it was wrongfooted by an army of retail investors who drove up the price of shares it had bet against, including GameStop. But <strong>Ark Investment Management</strong>, founded and run by a former investment officer at AllianceBernstein called Cathie Wood, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c48e0e37-95d2-4a18-8e1e-4129d49a776b\">reaped the rewards</a> of its bets on disruptive tech companies. It attracted $8.2bn to its actively managed exchange traded funds last month, outgunning established Wall Street titans BlackRock and State Street.</p> <p><strong>Chevron </strong>chief executive Mike Wirth and <strong>Exxon </strong>CEO Darren Woods discussed a merger last year following the&#xa0;outbreak of coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-chevron-ceos-discussed-merger-11612126203\">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>. The discussions, which are no longer active, would have resulted in the biggest merger of all time, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chevron-m-a-exxon-mobil-idINKBN2A00T5\">Reuters is reporting</a>. </p> <p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong>, the world's highest-grossing law firm, is on track to generate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcbd038f-23a3-4c8d-81e0-867ed84ea8a7\">record annual revenue</a> of about $5bn following overwhelming demand during the pandemic. It follows a year in which three of the firm's strongest areas — private equity, restructuring and litigation — all generated strong growth. Separately, US legal group <strong>Simpson Thacher</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98ad6bcb-f899-48ba-9cd9-87a20f1deaa0\">opening an EU office</a> in a sign of the disruption Brexit may cause corporate law firms.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>John Plender</strong> <br>Retail investors' success in inflicting a squeeze on hedge funds betting on a fall in stocks such as GameStop was as unexpected as their relish in the David and Goliath <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba875bce-0c7f-47f8-8c3f-5b98bd0b0b9b\">battle was palpable</a>. Yet the resulting extraordinary price gyrations raise&#xa0;tricky questions about market efficiency, regulation and financial stability.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Ford</strong> <br>Boris Johnson's government has promised to “level up” regions. It's an approach it could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e146a6f0-a018-4fa4-92d7-367a09572881\">usefully apply</a> to the relationship between public and private markets.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
