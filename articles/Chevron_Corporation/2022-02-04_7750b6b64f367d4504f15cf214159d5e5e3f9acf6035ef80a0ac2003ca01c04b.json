  "title": "Energy Companies Enjoy the Cash Flow --- Oil sector looks to a favorable market, but some say investors should demand fewer buybacks, more attention to balance sheets",
  "text": "<p>In a sea of red for nearly all sectors this year, companies producing oil and gas are a rare spot of green. While the S&amp;P 500 is down 6.1% year to date, oil-and-gas exploration companies in the index are up 24%.</p><p>Exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies have recovered a lot of lost ground since the plunge in 2020. The subindex is now four times where it was at its nadir in 2020. And it isn't without reason: This year, companies that make up the subindex are expected to generate free cash flow per share that is five times what they squeezed out in 2018, the last year (besides 2021) that Brent crude prices averaged above $70 a barrel.</p><p>Indeed, some are predicting a supercycle for oil, with RBC noting in a recent report that it is one of the \"rare parts of the cycle\" that are supported by both increasing demand and tightening supply. Road travel has rebounded strongly, with vehicle miles traveled reaching a 10-year high in November for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies aren't pumping out as much oil as they agreed to. And geopolitical risks -- whether those posed by Russia's mobilization on the Ukrainian border, uncertainty in Iran nuclear talks or supply disruptions in Libya -- all raise the prospect of there being less oil available than expected, not more.</p><p>So naturally it is an ideal time for oil-and-gas companies to try to win back investors fleeing growth stocks and looking for ways to hedge inflation risk. Despite the rally, oil-and-gas companies are still cheap. As a multiple of forward 12-month earnings, the subindex of oil-and-gas exploration companies in the S&amp;P 500 fetches half the valuation fetched pre-pandemic and about half of what the S&amp;P 500 goes for.</p><p>Yet the bullish outlook for oil presents another kind of conundrum. Companies are trying hard to stay in investors' graces. In a bad year like 2020, frackers spent most of their cash reducing debt. In 2021, they kept promises to keep capital expenditures down and gave guidance for a modest 2022. The remainder was for paying shareholders through dividends and buybacks.</p><p>Investors are already starting to show a preference for buybacks over repairing balance sheets, notes Mark Viviano, head of public equities at Kimmeridge Energy. Oil-and-gas companies have seen generous boosts in their share prices when they announced variable dividends or generous buybacks. Chevron's shares touched a record high recently after it announced a higher-than-expected dividend. APA, Apache's holding company, saw an 11% surge the week it announced a higher-than-expected cash return program in November, beating its peer group by 7 percentage points.</p><p>Mr. Viviano makes the case that the industry should focus on bringing debt levels down even more, noting that the downside volatility of the sector is what keeps a lot of investors on the sidelines. Since 2014, there were on average three months a year when the E&amp;P industry's subindex slipped more than 5%, according to a Kimmeridge analysis. Executives have never been good at predicting where commodity prices will go. Notably, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and Apache are among companies whose leverage -- net debt as a percentage of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- still hovers above their respective 15-year averages.</p><p>The refining sector provides a compelling point of comparison. It also suffered from share-price volatility and persistently low valuation but managed to turn that around after pulling back on capital spending and reducing debt. A subindex of refining and marketing companies in the S&amp;P 500 reduced net debt by more than 40% between 2008 and 2011. The sector historically saw three to five monthly drawdowns a year of over 5%, but starting in 2010 that has fallen to one or two months, according to a Kimmeridge analysis. The sector's enterprise value as a multiple of forward Ebitda recovered to seven times by 2017 from an average of four times in 2011.</p><p>E&amp;P companies' lack of discipline got the industry into its last jam. Now it is shareholders egging them on.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
