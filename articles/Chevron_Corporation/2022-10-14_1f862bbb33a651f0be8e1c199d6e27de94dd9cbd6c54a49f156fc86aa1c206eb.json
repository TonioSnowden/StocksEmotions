  "text": "<p>Good evening.</p> <p>Fresh data from the world's two biggest economies have followed a series of warnings from policymakers gathered in Washington this week about the urgency of defeating the surge in inflation.</p> <p>China today said its consumer price index <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51e859b3-b053-4262-8472-71c5f5b5edb5#post-e565c9a8-a71e-4f95-81e5-39e269fd0e29\">edged up to 2.8 per cent</a> in September, as easing commodity costs helped balance soaring increases in food, largely due to a jump in pork prices. Although slightly less than forecast, it was still the highest rate since April 2020 and up from August's 2.5 per cent.</p> <p>Compared with the rest of the world, however, the inflation outlook in China remains relatively benign. </p> <p>Data from the US yesterday showed a headline rate of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a8f934-ee38-4d8e-b56e-5a27b7bb8f62\">8.2 per cent</a> in September, with the “core” CPI measure up 6.6 per cent year on year, the fastest pace in four decades, when volatile energy and food costs were stripped out. The figures initially sparked a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/830e1327-716c-4973-9669-d4b65d6bdbf9\">sell-off on Wall Street</a> as investors faced the prospect of increasingly aggressive rate rises from the Federal Reserve, but this was later reversed, with some emphasising the backwards-looking nature of CPI and that newer data showed prices falling. </p> <p>Economists, however, said the bigger than expected inflation rate increase meant any hope of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df775130-08e7-4381-9aa2-f1256fda381e\">“pivot” from the Fed</a> was fading. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb80edad-f833-45ab-b945-2e9b6fbe400a\">minutes of their latest meeting</a>, the central bank's officials are more concerned about doing too little to rein in soaring US inflation than doing too much, doubling down on their plans to tighten monetary policy. </p> <p>This week's meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, the first in-person gatherings since the pandemic began, have been some of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab52e693-ec4a-43d9-ab88-4538a46c0778\">bleakest since the financial crisis</a>, writes economics editor Chris Giles.</p> <p>Finance ministers and central bank governors were reminded that the world was in a “dangerous situation” and urged by the IMF to “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f73d584f-fb2a-4a2f-ab8a-fa759031fa59\">stay the course</a>” on fighting inflation by raising borrowing costs fast. They also shared the IMF's view that the worse was yet to come.</p> <p>This course of action is not without side-effects. The rapid rise in US interest rates is causing problems across the world, driving up inflation elsewhere and fuelling market volatility. </p> <p>And some countries, such as the UK, with its shambolic (and now partially reversed) “mini” Budget, were actually making things worse, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd8c0d49-22ad-4d5f-bc8e-58e3ba53a6a0\">IMF argued</a>, with inflation likely to last longer than in their peer economies. The UK was the talk of Washington, Giles reported, seen as a case study in what can happen if governments are not careful to co-ordinate fiscal with monetary policy.</p> <p>Consumers, meanwhile, are being squeezed. To take just one example, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a91a3c9-edc9-4241-aa07-cf55712057c7\">UK grocery inflation</a> hit almost 14 per cent in September, with a growing number of Britons switching to cheaper products and own-label goods.</p> <p>The challenge, said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, was dealing with a world in transition from predictability, where rates and inflation were low, to a new era of instability. “We have to really work on changing our mindset to be much more precautionary and be prepared for much more uncertainty,” she concluded. </p> <p><strong>Key links</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\">Global inflation tracker</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95745636-2d21-46aa-b0f1-6bda1c0fdd0b\">Calculate your personal inflation rate</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7a284d7-f117-4628-bd5a-92569e03e505\">FT readers tell us how they are coping</a></p></li> </ul> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Most Britons have ‘no idea' about their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fafb219f-f19a-4c85-b039-66b8d57efc00\">likely retirement income</a></p></li>  <li><p>Putin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbb7db99-d78f-4dde-8e49-4d0e6732e484\">signals end</a> of Russia's unpopular mobilisation drive</p></li>  <li><p>Hungary's overnight interest rates jump in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/beb4601f-268b-47f0-a784-13f0586420ad\">attack against forint short sellers</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51e859b3-b053-4262-8472-71c5f5b5edb5\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>UK prime minister <strong>Liz Truss</strong> summoned her <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63ac7dab-d8e4-412c-a910-c0013fdf7f3d\">chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng</a> back from the IMF/World Bank meetings in DC and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt as the fallout from Kwarteng's “mini” Budget continued. She also ditched plans to reverse a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69e50608-a817-4df2-bbfd-29260cfc1c2c\">corporation tax</a> cut.

The next wave is intended to offer longer-lasting or broader protection against new variants and, potentially, other coronaviruses, and be available as nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets.</p> <p>There was some good news, however, from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, which said their new <strong>two-strain booster</strong> would provide better protection against the most common Omicron variant. They are the first to report preliminary results from a clinical trial on humans of such a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/770af62a-574a-447a-8d9a-5c2015608d88\">bivalent booster</a>”.</p> <p>China's decision not to allow sales of messenger RNA-based <strong>Covid-19 vaccines</strong> from Moderna or BioNTech/Pfizer is “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d7d811-857d-4839-a9fc-9e68e5e4fe02\">mind boggling</a>”, according to one of the country's most prominent biotech companies.
