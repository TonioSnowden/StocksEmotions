  "title": "World News: Myanmar Coup Hits Foreign Businesses",
  "text": "<p>Migrant workers have been fleeing industrial areas near Yangon, the country's largest city, since security forces gunned down at least 37 demonstrators there on March 14 and flames tore through Chinese-owned garment factories amid the chaos.</p><p>Energy giants Total SE and Chevron Corp., which have business ties with a state-owned company, are under pressure to prevent revenue from flowing to the army that controls the government.</p><p>\"For businesses in general the conditions are pretty unworkable,\" said a senior U.N. official in Myanmar. \"There's a sense of impending doom.\"</p><p>The Feb. 1 coup ended Myanmar's decadelong transition toward democracy. Police and soldiers have responded with horrific violence to the protests that followed, killing at least 247 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit that monitors arrests and fatalities.</p><p>Reduced investment by foreign companies may not shift the military's calculus, analysts focused on Myanmar say, because the army appears more motivated by political primacy than economic development. The generals withstood decades of economic sanctions -- lifted gradually over the past 10 years during the democratic shift -- and are accustomed to ruling under international isolation.</p><p>Still, an economic collapse caused by strikes, potentially amplified by a threat of foreign investors exiting, would create challenges for them. Sectors like apparel and infrastructure have attracted substantial investment over the past decade, especially from Asian countries, and employ hundreds of thousands of workers.</p><p>Some foreign companies are relocating staff who live near protest hot spots to secure hotels and are encouraging nonessential expatriate employees to leave the country, according to Jack Mullan, chief executive of Singapore-based risk-management firm Barber Mullan and Associates, which advises foreign businesses there.</p><p>Even basic tasks have become complicated. Companies that typically wire money from elsewhere in Asia to pay wages are finding that, with many banks in Myanmar closed, transfers aren't going through. Mr. Mullan said a transfer he made to a private Myanmar bank on March 2 has yet to clear. \"It's a big stress for many companies -- how will they get cash at the end of the month?\" he said.</p><p>Dale Buckner, chief executive of McLean, Va.-based security-services company Global Guardian, said his firm has a workaround to help its seven large corporate clients in Myanmar: It wires funds to a broker in Singapore who has cash in Myanmar, and the cash is then delivered in bundles to the offices of the Myanmar clients. The total delivered has reached around $2.5 million, and the broker's fee has risen to 25%, Mr. Buckner said, from 12% six weeks ago.</p><p>Since early March, clothing brands that source garments from Myanmar, such as Sweden's Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB and Italy's Benetton Group SRL, have paused orders, citing instability. Garment manufacturers, whose production accounts for around a quarter of the country's exports, say it is becoming harder to staff factories. Thousands of workers have fled two of Yangon's industrial suburbs since the March 14 protests that left dozens dead.</p><p>Activists and a group representing ousted Myanmar legislators have called on French energy company Total -- whose operations in Myanmar waters supply gas for the domestic market and for export to neighboring Thailand -- to stop transferring revenue to its state-owned partner Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise. The legislators' group said in a letter to Total that continuing the payments would fund the junta.</p><p>Western oil-and-gas companies worry that could be a breach of contract and invite legal reprisals against local employees, according to a person familiar with their thinking. There are no easy options for exiting the country, the person said. Negotiating a sale to exit from the country could take months or years, and quickly handing over fields to an unprepared new operator could lead to power outages, the person said.</p>",
