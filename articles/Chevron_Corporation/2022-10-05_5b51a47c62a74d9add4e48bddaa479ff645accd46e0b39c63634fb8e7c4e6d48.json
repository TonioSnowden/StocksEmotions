  "title": "U.S. Plans to Ease Venezuela Sanctions, Enabling Chevron to Pump Oil; The proposed deal would require Caracas to open talks with political opponents, with the aim of free elections in 2024",
  "text": "<p>In exchange for the significant sanctions relief, the government of Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro would resume long-suspended talks with the country's opposition to discuss conditions needed to hold free and fair presidential elections in 2024, the people said. The U.S., Venezuela's government and some Venezuelan opposition figures have also worked out a deal that would free up hundreds of millions of dollars in Venezuelan state funds frozen in American banks to pay for imports of food, medicine and equipment for the country's battered electricity grid and municipal water systems.</p><p>U.S. officials cautioned that the deal could fall through, since it is contingent on Mr. Maduro's top aides resuming talks with the opposition in good faith.</p><p>If the deal goes through and Chevron, along with U.S. oil service companies, are allowed to work in Venezuela again, it would put only a limited amount of new oil on the world market in the short term.</p><p>Venezuela was once a major oil producer, pumping more than 3.2 million barrels a day in the 1990s, but the state-run industry has collapsed over the last decade because of underinvestment, corruption and mismanagement. Sanctions leveled by the Trump administration further dented production and forced Western companies out of the country.</p><p>Any shift in U.S. policy that brings back Western oil companies would send a psychological signal to the market that more supply is on the way, the people said. Word of a possible American rapprochement with Venezuela is emerging just as OPEC+ countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to slash production in response to sagging oil prices, angering the Biden administration.</p><p>But engaging Venezuela, which sits atop some of the world's largest oil reserves, could serve as a longer-term strategy for the U.S. and European countries scrambling to secure new energy sources as Russia's war in Ukraine drags on and upends commodities markets, said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University.</p><p>\"If [oil] prices come down, this all could change,\" said Mr. Monaldi, \"But for now, this is their obsession.\"</p><p>The U.S.-Venezuela agreement, the terms of which are expected to be shored up later this month, is the latest sign that Washington is willing to wind down a pressure campaign against the Maduro government that it inherited from the Trump administration.</p><p>Collin Eaton and Andrew Scurria contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Plans to Ease Venezuela Sanctions, Enabling Chevron to Pump Oil</p>",
