  "text": "<p>One thing to start:</p> <p>The activists are now coming for Royal Dutch Shell. Third Point, one of New York's most famous hedge funds, has called for the Anglo-Dutch supermajor to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4fc6926-e991-43ca-9ac8-3b1478c23dd5\">split up</a> — one business to handle the “legacy” oil and gas assets, and another to focus on clean energy. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“You can't be all things to all people. In trying to do so, Shell has ended up with unhappy shareholders who have been starved of&#xa0;returns,” a letter from the hedge fund said. </p> </blockquote> <p>Welcome back to another Energy Source — and a doozy of a few days for energy in Washington.</p> <p>First up is methane. The latest rumour is that the Environmental Protection Agency's long-awaited methane rule for oil and gas will land later today. It's likely to include new performance standards such as a requirement to cut pollution per unit of energy produced. And that will apply to both new and existing assets including marginal wells: the many thousands of US wells that produce little oil and gas individually but can be heinous to the environment. (The pollution involved in some of these small producing assets was exposed recently in this must-read <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/diversified-energy-natural-gas-wells-methane-leaks-2021/\">deep-dive from Bloomberg</a>.) </p> <p>The new rule will step up efforts to eradicate one of the American oil industry's most wasteful and destructive practices — methane pollution — and give the US more credibility in the global push to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Given that a proposed methane tax seems unlikely to be part of the Democrats' reconciliation bill when it finally goes to a vote, the new ruling will give Joe Biden at least something to point to when he attends next week's Glasgow climate conference.</p> <p>Meanwhile, congressional talks are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38770267-8fed-49a9-a85a-1b9cc2e45d60\">rumbling on</a>, and indications are that the final package will include more than $500bn in energy and climate spending measures. </p> <p>And later today American Big Oil executives will testify in on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>The event should capture some of the cognitive dissonance infecting energy policy discussions in Congress, where the message to fossil fuel producers at present seems to be: hurry up and produce more of those planet-killing hydrocarbons we don't want you to produce!</p> <p>The Big Oil appearance is the subject of our first note.</p> <p>Our second is about that energy inflation. By historical standards, energy prices in the US are high but not close to the peaks. Still, inflation is causing distress. An alarming number of American households are now foregoing basic needs — food and medicine — to pay for energy. </p> <p>Don't miss a double helping of Data Drill on the rise of green bonds and the rapid expansion of battery storage.</p> <p>Thanks for reading. </p> <h1>Big Oil's Big Tobacco moment . . .?</h1> <p>It's a big day for Big Oil.</p> <p>Later this morning, six industry executives will line up (remotely) for a grilling by members of Congress over whether they misled the public over the role of fossil fuels in driving climate change.</p> <p>In the dock are the chief executives of US supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron, the Americas bosses of Shell and BP, and the heads of lobby groups the American Petroleum Institute and US Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>Many are framing it as Big Oil's Big Tobacco moment. And commentators are already trying to make monikers stick: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/14/congress-hearing-oil-exxon-bp-shell-chevron\">The Big Oil Four,</a> <a href=\"https://payupclimatepolluters.org/slippery-six\">The Slippery Six</a>.</p> <p>But the parallels being drawn with to the 1994 hearings — when tobacco bosses insisted nicotine was not addictive, firing the starting gun on the industry's fall from grace — may prove overstated. </p> <p>Politicians will grandstand. Accusations will be levelled. The witnesses will deny any wrongdoing. But the virtual nature of the session will likely detract from its impact. Those hoping for a watershed moment could well be left disappointed.</p> <p>ES has had an advance look at some of the witness testimony. Expect the executives to insist they have not misled the public in any way and are doing their best to combat climate change with new technology and emissions targets.</p> <p>Expect Democrats to talk tough and burnish their green credentials. Expect Republicans to steer the conversation towards high energy prices — and berate Joe Biden.</p> <p>Still, the cross examinations could yield testy exchanges. Committee chairs Carolyn Maloney and Ro Khanna have already hit out at what they labelled “a co-ordinated effort to spread disinformation to mislead the public and prevent crucial action to address climate change”. They have also accused the companies of failing to play ball with their requests for documents ahead of the hearing. </p> <p>Regardless of the level of substance that emerges today, Khanna has made it clear that the hearing is just the start of a year long probe into climate disinformation that could reach into a host of other industries from social media to advertising. </p> <p>“This will be a year-long investigation and the hearings mark the beginning of it,” he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/big-oil-hearing-kick-off-us-probe-into-climate-disinformation-lawmaker-2021-10-27/\">told Reuters</a> yesterday. “The idea is for them to admit to the American people what they have done.”</p> <p>Keep an eye on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/energy\">FT.com</a> throughout the day for coverage of the hearing.</p> <p><em>(Myles McCormick)</em></p> <h1>The impact of American energy insecurity </h1> <p>More than a quarter of American households with children struggled to pay their energy bills at least once in the past year, says US Census Household Pulse Survey data released last week. </p> <p>The situation is expected to get worse as colder weather and higher fuel prices send energy expenditures up. The US Energy Information Administration forecasts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4900678-bc9c-4aca-9ad6-fb5b2f1a654b\">half of American homes</a> will see their winter heating bills increase by 30 per cent. </p> <p>“This is going to be a brutal winter,” said Sanya Carley, professor at Indiana University's O'Neill School. “It's going to be a winter that affects those that already live on the margins so much more.”&#xa0;</p> <p>When it comes to energy insecurity, Americans do not equally bear the brunt. Forty per cent of black households report being unable to pay their energy bills at least once in the past year, compared with 15 per cent of white households and 30 per cent of Latino households, according to US Census data. </p> <p>Low-income households and households with children are also more likely to be energy insecure. While 20 per cent of Americans report having difficulty paying their bills this year, the number was more than double for households earning less than $25,000. </p> <p>Experts expect pandemic unemployment, increased energy demand, and expiring utility moratoria to have worsened the problem. A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-00763-9\"><em>Nature </em>study</a> conducted by Indiana University's Carley and other researchers found that the proportion of households disconnected from the grid after they received a notice rose from 41 to 48 per cent in the first month of the pandemic. </p> <p>While many states implemented <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0853c63-9bc0-4ded-9638-ea4a73b4d2e1\">utility disconnection</a> moratoria in the pandemic, most have expired, and households are racking up utility debt just as they're forced to pay the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d52facb-7a24-40d0-a220-6d92b4e78973\">highest bills</a> for energy in nearly seven years. With winter looming, lawmakers are <a href=\"https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-temperatures-forecast-to-fall-and-energy-costs-projected-to-rise-durbin-and-duckworth-join-call-for-swift-release-of-liheap-heating-help\">pushing for expanded</a> relief funding like the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. </p> <p>Energy insecurity has drastic effects on health and wellbeing. Over a third of US households with children report forgoing basic household necessities like medicine and food to pay their energy bills, according to the US Census survey. Previous research has shown that when households can't afford their energy bills, they turn to dangerous coping strategies like using ovens and staying in cars to keep warm. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Sustainable bonds are seeing record year-on-year growth in the third quarter, as investors put climate at the top of their agenda. A new Moody's report found that global issuance of green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds totalled $217bn in the third quarter, up 25 per cent from the same period last year. While growth declined from the second quarter, the credit firm expects total bond issuance to reach $1tn by the end of the year. </p> <p>Europe is paving the way for green and sustainability bonds, according to the report, with European green bonds accounting for 57 per cent of the third quarter's total, worth $65bn. &#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, global energy storage markets will rapidly expand in the next decade, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The market doubled in size in 2021 and will increase 17 times by 2030, with the US and China continuing to dominate, Wood Mac reckons. </p> <p>“The rise of the ‘prosumer' (consumers who also produce energy) alongside policy support for net-zero objectives and the need for power market flexibility will all play a role in this upward trajectory,” said analyst Anna Darmani in the firm's press release. In July, China announced its five-year target to install 30 gigawatts of new energy storage. </p> <p>In the residential sector, the firm expects Europe to lose its leadership in energy storage to the Americas by 2023. Nevertheless, European energy storage is expected to increase 10-fold as households adopt solar systems and electric vehicles. EV sales in Europe are expected to increase 94 per cent by 2030. </p> <p>“The European Commission has set a 55 per cent emission reduction target by 2030 and is targeting 65 per cent renewable power supply by 2030, which will boost demand for energy storage assets,” Darmani said. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dfb0201-ef77-4c05-93cd-1e277c7017cf\">every country's emissions</a> and pledges ahead of COP26. &#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>China will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb5e8f78-59bd-4327-9710-6dce1a42088f\">expand hydropower</a> and energy storage in its new plan to reduce emissions.</p></li>  <li><p>Gillian Tett argues why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a2ebd6f-0db7-4369-885e-d3e89b974b69\">green activists</a> should not ignore Fox News. </p></li>  <li><p>Australian billionaire and mining mogul says the oil industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/205dc934-1aa0-4d8d-87dd-60a764793fbc\">blue hydrogen</a> projects won't curb emissions.</p></li>  <li><p>McKinsey employees are frustrated with the firm's support of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Climate+news%3A&amp;utm_campaign=TDC+Daily\">large polluters</a>.
