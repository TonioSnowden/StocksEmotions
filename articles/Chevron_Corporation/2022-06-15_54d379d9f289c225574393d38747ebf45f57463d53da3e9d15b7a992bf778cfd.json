  "title": "Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits; Facing pressure to act on gasoline prices that are helping to drive up inflation, president says he is ready to use emergency measures to raise output if necessary",
  "text": "<p>The president called on the companies to take immediate action to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. He said his administration was prepared to use its emergency authorities to increase capacity in the near term, if necessary.</p><p>Mr. Biden added that he had directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to hold an emergency meeting and to engage with the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that represents the oil industry.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon, a key driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on American consumers ahead of midterm elections this year. A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC Poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy, frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings.</p><p>But Mr. Biden's short-term options for lowering gasoline prices are limited, according to analysts, and the steps he has taken have done little to slow surging prices. Without an easy fix, the president has increasingly blamed oil companies and sought to convince the public that prices at the pump are out of his control, pointing Russia's war in Ukraine as the main driver.</p><p>Mr. Biden's letter was sent to Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips 66, Chevron Corp., BP and Shell. The companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Last week, when Mr. Biden said Exxon made \"more money than God this year,\" the company responded saying it plans to increase its refining capacity to process U.S.-produced light crude, by about 250,000 barrels a day. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said that was \"the equivalent of adding a new medium-size refinery.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden requested that the companies provide his administration with an explanation of any reductions in capacity since 2020 as well as ideas for addressing high prices.</p><p>Prices for gasoline and diesel have vaulted to historic highs in recent weeks as crude prices have climbed and refineries have struggled to keep up with rising fuel demand, both in the U.S. and in international markets.</p><p>U.S. refineries closed about 1 million barrels a day of capacity during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Fuel makers have been running full tilt in recent weeks, using 93.7% of their operable capacity last week, down from the prior week's 94.2%, which was the highest level since summer 2019. Meanwhile, commercial inventories of crude oil and petroleum products have reached the lowest levels since 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Mr. Biden has said tackling record inflation, including high gasoline prices, is his economic priority. Inflation has contributed to the president's low poll numbers, and some Democrats worry it could lead to steep losses for Mr. Biden's party in the coming midterm elections.</p><p>The Biden administration has taken several steps to address high gasoline prices, with limited success. The U.S. has released oil from the country's strategic stockpiles in coordination with other nations and allowed high-ethanol content gasoline to be sold in the summer months.</p><p>White House officials said Mr. Biden is considering additional measures, including calling for a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax.</p><p>The Biden administration has faced criticism from Republicans and some in the oil industry for energy policies that they see as too restrictive. Mr. Biden has said the U.S. should shift away from fossil fuels in the long term in response to climate change. But as prices have risen, he has said the U.S. must expand supply in the shorter term to help consumers.</p><p>The Biden administration can do little to quickly alleviate consumers' pain at the pump, or increase refineries' capacity and fuel supplies, analysts say. Refineries are making money now but have operated on far thinner margins in recent years, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when economic lockdowns led to a historic crash in demand.</p><p>Before the pandemic, fuel demand was plateauing in developed economies and sales of electric vehicles were rising. Meanwhile, regulators have stepped up fuel-efficiency standards that have led vehicles to use less gasoline.</p><p>In recent years, some oil companies have sold off refineries and shut others down amid anemic margins. Last year, Shell sold refinery stakes in Washington state, Alabama, and Texas, but couldn't find a buyer for a facility in Louisiana, and later announced it would close it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phillips 66 closed a weather-damaged oil refinery in Belle Chasse, La., following Hurricane Ida, and said it would convert it to a terminal facility. The Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company running another refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands to pause operations last year following \"multiple major mishaps\" involving releases of pollutants and oil.</p><p>It is unlikely companies will bring those refineries back online quickly, analysts said, and the capacity situation isn't expected to improve soon as some refining companies including Phillips 66 plan to convert some facilities to make biofuels. Chemical maker LyondellBasell Industries NV is slated to close a century-old Houston refinery next year.</p><p>Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said refineries in operation today are currently making as much fuel as they can.</p><p>\"You can have more gas, or you can have more diesel, but you can't have both,\" he said.</p><p>Oil companies will almost certainly never build another new refinery in the U.S., said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho. The last new U.S. refinery was built in the 1970s, and the industry now considers them too expensive, and burdensome to invest in due to strict environmental rules. Some are expanding capacity at existing facilities, but that process can't easily be sped up, Mr. Yawger said.</p><p>Some refineries, in pursuit of high margins on fuel, are already running at extremely high rates that, if sustained for too long, could risk breakdowns or worse, he added.</p><p>\"He is playing a dangerous game putting pressure on them,\" Mr. Yawger said of Mr. Biden.</p><p>Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits</p>",
