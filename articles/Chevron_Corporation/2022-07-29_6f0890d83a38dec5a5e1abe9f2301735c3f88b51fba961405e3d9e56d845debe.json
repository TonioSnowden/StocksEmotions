  "text": "<p>Share Your Thoughts</p><p>What is your outlook on oil prices for the rest of the year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said that despite concerns about an economic slowdown, the company continues to see strong demand for oil and fuel, albeit softened somewhat due to high prices. \"And supply is responding,\" Mr. Breber said, citing a 6.5% increase in Chevron's U.S. oil and gas production compared with the first half of last year.</p><p>On Thursday, Shell reportedits second consecutive record quarterly profit, hitting $16.7 billion in profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis, a figure similar to net income that U.S. oil companies report.</p><p>The companies' banner profits mark a significant turnaround for an industry that hemorrhaged cash and saw scores of companies file for bankruptcy following the worldwide outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. Exxon and Chevron posted historic losses that year, and Exxon got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average while energy sunk to less than 2.5% of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Oil and gas demand has roared back as countries have lifted pandemic quarantine measures. Western sanctions against Russian energy have pushed commodity prices even higher. Now, as the U.S. economy is contracting, the oil industry's lofty earnings have become a rare bright spot for investors.</p><p>Oil and gas shares have outperformed the market this year, with the S&amp;P 500 Energy index up about 35% since the start of 2022, compared with a 15% drop for the broader index. Since the start of 2022, Exxon and Chevron shares are up about 46% and 26%, respectively, while the energy sector has grown to more than 4% of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Still, many institutional investors, such as pension and mutual funds, remain reluctant to back fossil-fuel companies primarily because of concerns about their impact on the climate and long-term questions about their profitability as some countries shift to greener energy. But, the companies' recent performance has made the sector harder for those investors to ignore, said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive and senior portfolio manager of Adams Funds.</p><p>\"When you have a sector that went from under 2.5% of the S&amp;P 500 to over 4%, it gets everybody's attention,\" Mr. Stoeckle said. \"If you ignored energy for the last seven or eight years, you were paid handsomely for doing so. Now, the landscape has changed.\"</p><p>Despite the record profits, Exxon and Chevron signaled they will stick with relatively conservative spending plans in the oil patch, instead choosing to reward investors and strengthen their finances. Exxon returned $7.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter. With a cash balance of $18.9 billion, a $12 billion increase from the end of 2021, Exxon's ratio of net debt to capital dropped to 13%, which would help gird the company for an economic slowdown.</p><p>San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron lifted the upper end of its share-repurchase program this year to as much as $15 billion, up from $10 billion, and paid off debt. Shell plans to buy back another $6 billion in shares over the next quarter, while also reducing its net debt.</p><p>Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Exxon, Chevron, Shell Report Record Profits on High Energy Prices</p>",
