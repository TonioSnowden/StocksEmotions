  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.2% Friday, pulling from back a fresh record reached Thursday. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, in contrast, added about 30 points, or 0.1%, after wavering between gains and losses throughout the session.</p><p>All three indexes are still on track for big monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.5% for the month, on pace for its largest monthly increase since November of last year.</p><p>Apple shares recently fell 3.5%, and Amazon.com shares retreated 3.9%. Together, both companies account for nearly 10% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization.</p><p>\"Because they are two big household names, it could be a fragile market,\" said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. While investors have known about supply-chain and inflation issues for months, he said, \"The question is, is it going to continue to be a problem? We don't buy equities based on what's happening right now, we buy based on what's going to happen in the future.\"</p><p>Overall, strong earnings have supported stocks' recent rally. On Friday, the two largest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, reported their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the pandemic. Shares gained 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Starbucks shares slid 6.7% after the coffee chain said its U.S. sales were strong, but the pandemic's resurgence in China had dragged on revenue.</p><p>Fresh data Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending grew more slowly in September, as the Covid-19 Delta variant and supply-chain disruptions weighed on households.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%. Shares of Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, rose more than 20% from its initial public offering price when it started trading Friday in Stockholm.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.575% from 1.568% Thursday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>Investors sold off eurozone government bonds after fresh data showed that inflation in the eurozone accelerated in October at the fastest pace since July 2008.</p><p>This came after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Thursday that investors were wrong to expect the ECB to increase interest rates next year in response to rising inflation. The selloff in bond markets this week suggests investors doubt the central bank's ability to hold that line.</p><p>\"The market was betting on the full credibility of the ECB, and is now having doubts,\" said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>In Asia, stock indexes closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.8%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up almost 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7%.</p><p>â€”Caitlin McCabe contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Slips After Apple, Amazon Earnings Disappoint</p>",
