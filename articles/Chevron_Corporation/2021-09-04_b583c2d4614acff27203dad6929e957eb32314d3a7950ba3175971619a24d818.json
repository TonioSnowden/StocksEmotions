  "title": "Tyson, Union Agree on Vaccines",
  "text": "<p>Since announcing the vaccination requirement for its 120,000 U.S. workers on Aug. 3, Tyson said more than 30,000 have been vaccinated. The Arkansas company estimated that about three-quarters of its U.S. workforce now have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Workers in the $213 billion U.S. meat industry were among the hardest hit during Covid-19's initial spread through the country in spring 2020. Spreading infections killed more than 130 workers in U.S. meat plants, according to labor union estimates, and led to temporary shutdowns of some of the country's biggest meat plants.</p><p>Meat companies installed automated temperature checks, issued face coverings to workers and placed partitions between cutting-line work stations where employees often stand shoulder to shoulder for hours. While meat companies including JBS USA Holdings Inc., Cargill Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc. have promoted vaccination and in some cases offered cash bonuses and even free meat giveaways, Tyson so far has been the only major meat company to mandate vaccination across its workforce.</p><p>\"The vaccine is the single most effective tool we have available,\" Tyson Chief Executive Donnie King said in August. \"It would be irresponsible to not try and utilize that and protect our team members.\"</p><p>Tyson's policy announced Friday will provide up to 20 hours of paid sick leave a year for fully vaccinated workers, beginning in 2022, which the UFCW called the first policy of its kind for a major meatpacking company. Tyson also will give new hires one week of paid vacation after six months of employment, Tyson said.</p><p>The new policies cover all of Tyson's U.S. facilities, and will apply to union and nonunion employees.</p><p>Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, moved to require Covid-19 vaccinations for its entire U.S. workforce after company and union efforts to promote the shots had resulted in under half of those employees being inoculated since the shots became widely available early this year. The UFCW said the mandate needed to be negotiated with labor leaders and that full approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would help ease some workers' concerns about the vaccines' safety.</p><p>About 31,000 Tyson workers in the U.S. are unionized, the company said.</p><p>The FDA on Aug. 23 granted full approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Previously, the vaccine was authorized for emergency use. Tyson will provide exemptions for some workers on a medical or religious basis, the UFCW said.</p><p>Mark Lauritsen, the UFCW's international vice president for meatpacking, said Tyson's new benefits would help the company better compete for workers in a tight labor environment.</p><p>Other meatpackers may not immediately follow suit with their own vaccine requirements, Mr. Lauritsen said, as some already have higher vaccination rates among employees, while others monitor whether Tyson loses workers ahead of its Nov. 1 deadline for all employees to be vaccinated. The UFCW also represents workers at Smithfield, Cargill, JBS and other meat-producing companies.</p><p>Tyson's Mr. King said last month that the vaccination requirement could have short-term effects on the company's workforce, but that it would have a longer-term benefit.</p><p>While Covid-19 vaccine mandates for rank-and-file workers so far remain relatively rare across corporate America, labor unions have in some cases supported employers' efforts. Walt Disney Co. in late August reached a deal with unions representing workers at Disney World in Florida that will require around 40,000 workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 22. Union leaders representing AT&amp;T Inc. workers have been negotiating with that company to make sure its mandate was implemented fairly, union officials have said.</p><p>U.S. employers have broadly encouraged workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19, offering incentives and time off for workers who take the shots, though some companies have stopped short of mandating vaccinations for fear of losing workers in a tight labor market. Other companies, such as Walmart Inc., have focused vaccine requirements on managers and corporate workers, rather than hourly employees. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. oil company, in late August said it would require Covid-19 vaccines for expatriate employees, workers traveling internationally, and employees on U.S.-flagged ships.</p><p>JBS is piloting mandatory vaccination for new hires at some facilities, including its corporate offices, a spokesman said. About 75% of JBS's workforce is fully vaccinated, he said.</p><p>While companies including Tyson have said infections among workers have fallen, meat processors this year are grappling with labor shortages that have constrained production of chicken wings, bacon and other products as the U.S. economy reopens.</p><p>In August, Tyson executives said that on any given day at least 10% of positions in the company's plants are unstaffed, and that it takes Tyson six days to get five days' worth of normal production from its operations.</p><p>Tyson last month reported a 42% increase in quarterly profits, boosted by demand from reopening restaurants.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
