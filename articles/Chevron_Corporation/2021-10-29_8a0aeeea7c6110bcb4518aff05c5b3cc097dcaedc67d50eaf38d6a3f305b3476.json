  "title": "Stock Futures Fall After Apple, Amazon Earnings; S&P 500 hit a record Thursday and is on track to end October with largest one-month percentage gain since November",
  "text": "<p>Investors have been monitoring earnings for signs that stickier-than-expected inflation and shipping and logistics delays are weighing on profits. Apple said that supply-chain disruptions were hindering the manufacturing of iPhones and other products and would bring increased challenges during the holiday-shopping season. Amazon posted lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and signaled that a tight labor market and supply-chain disruptions would weigh on fourth-quarter earnings.</p><p>In premarket trading, Apple shares fell 3.7%, and Amazon.com shares retreated 4.8%.</p><p>\"Because they are two big household names, it could be a fragile market,\" said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. While investors have known about supply-chain and inflation issues for months, he said, \"The question is, is it going to continue to be a problem? We don't buy equities based on what's happening right now, we buy based on what's going to happen in the future.\"</p><p>Meantime, Facebook shares added 1.2% premarket after the company changed its name to Meta to reflect growth opportunities beyond its namesake social-media platform in the digital realms known as the metaverse.</p><p>Overall, strong earnings have supported a stock rally this month. About 82% of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have posted results this reporting season have beaten analysts' earnings expectations, according to FactSet data from early Thursday. Companies including Chevron, Colgate-Palmolive and Exxon Mobil are slated to report earnings before the market opens.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.596% from 1.568% Thursday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>U.S. consumer spending data, due out at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show an increase in September, driven both by higher prices and higher demand.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.4%. Shares of Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, rose more than 10% from its initial public offering price when it started trading Friday in Stockholm.</p><p>In Asia, stock indexes closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.8%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up almost 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Fall After Apple, Amazon Earnings</p>",
