  "text": "<p>Revenue jumped to $115.681 billion from $67.742 billion a year ago</p><p>Exxon handily topped the analyst estimate of $3.94 a share and its revenue target of $111.3 billion, according to FactSet data.</p><p>The nearly $18 billion in profit for the quarter eclipsed the $15.91 billion Exxon earned in the second quarter of 2012 for the highest profit in the history of the company, which traces its roots to 1882 when it was founded by John D. Rockefeller.</p><p>Exxon increased Permian oil and gas production by about 130,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day and refining throughput by 180,000 barrels per day compared with the first half of 2021 to address a recovery in demand.</p><p>Capex totaled $9.5 billion for the first half, on track with full-year guidance.</p><p>CEO Darren Woods said Exxon benefited from increased production, higher price realizations and \"tight\" cost controls.</p><p>\"Strong second-quarter results reflect our focus on the fundamentals and the investments we put in motion several years ago and sustained through the depths of the pandemic,\" Woods said.</p><p>Second-quarter oil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrelsper day. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and the impact of curtailed production in Russia, oil-equivalent production increased 4% versus the first quarter. Liquids volumes rose by about 35,000 barrels per day and natural gas volumes increased by more than 150 million cubic feet per day.</p><p>Looking ahead, Exxon said it's expanding its refining capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023. The growth represents the industry's largest single capacity addition in the U.S. since 2012, Exxon said.</p><p>Exxon shares have gained 51.4% in 2022, outperforming the loss of 10.5% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the drop of 14.6% by the S&amp;P 500 SPX.</p><p>For its part, Chevron CVX share gained 3.5% after the oil-and-gas company said its second-quarter profit increased to $11.62 billion, or $5.95 a share, from $3.08 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the year-ago period, with currency effects increasing earnings by $668 million.</p><p>Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share totaled $5.82, well above the analyst target of $5.08, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue soared 82.9% to $68.76 billion, smashing the FactSet consensus of $58.66 billion.</p><p>Average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids climbed 64.8% to $89, and the average sales price of natural gas jumped 188.0% to $6.22 per thousand cubic feet.</p><p>The company's average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids rose 64.8% to $89 in the second quarter, while the average sales price of natural gas rocketed 188% to $6.22 per thousand cubic feet.</p><p>Net oil-equivalent production grew about 3.2% to 1.17 million barrels per day. For U.S. downstream, refinery crude oil input fell 8% to 881,000 barrels per day, due primarily to planned turnarounds. The company said it more than doubled investment to grow traditional and new energy business lines.</p><p>During the quarter Chevron sanctioned its $1.6 billion Ballymore project in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Chevron will produce the project through an existing facility with allocated capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</p><p>The stock has run up 28.2% year to date through Thursday.</p><p>Also Read: Biden blasts refiners' profits as 'not acceptable,' while Democratic senator targets Big Oil's 'profiteering</p><p>Exxon hits record profit and Chevron's triples amid high energy prices</p>",
