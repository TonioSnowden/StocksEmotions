  "title": "Gas Prices, Oil Executives Take Center Stage at Congressional Hearing; Democrats blame industry for high fuel prices, while Republicans say Biden should have done more to encourage domestic production",
  "text": "<p>Democratic lawmakers who lead the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel directed blame at the oil industry, which they say is making use of energy shortfalls to boost profit.</p><p>Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.), who chairs the oversight panel, kicked off the hearing by criticizing oil companies for not stepping up production to help increase supplies.</p><p>\"Now it's time for Congress to alleviate the pain many Americans are feeling at the pump,\" she said.</p><p>Rep. Morgan Griffith (R., Va.), the top Republican on the oversight subcommittee, responded that President Biden bore responsibility for the rising prices by an \"anti-American energy agenda,\" including by canceling the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline extension.</p><p>\"We need to look for ways to increase our domestic production and our export capacity,\" Mr. Griffith said. \"We need energy policy that promotes energy security while also taking advantage of America's abundant energy resources.\"</p><p>Oil-industry leaders have denied that they are profiteering, saying the rising fuel costs stem from shortages driven first by the quick economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and later by Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p><p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in remarks prepared for the hearing that his company has started to exit from an oil-and-gas project it runs on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine and that the company will make no further investments in Russia.</p><p>Closing that venture would remove nearly 230,000 barrels a day from global oil supplies, about 3% of the company's overall oil production, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.</p><p>\"Russia provides roughly 10% of the oil needed to meet global demand, and about 30% of Europe's natural-gas demand,\" Mr. Woods said. \"A loss of this volume would dwarf the impact of the Arab oil embargo and represent the largest supply disruption in the history of our industry.\"</p><p>Other executives scheduled to address the panel are Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth; Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell PLC's U.S. arm; David Lawler, chairman and president of BP PLC's U.S. arm; Pioneer Natural Resources Co. CEO Scott Sheffield; and Devon Energy Corp. Chief Executive Richard Muncrief.</p><p>Oil-industry profits are expected to be a major focus of the hearing. Exxon reported $23 billion and Chevron nearly $16 billion in net income for 2021, the most profitable year for both since 2014. They rebounded from multibillion-dollar losses in 2020.</p><p>Both companies attributed their turnarounds to surging demand for oil and gasoline as the economy has recovered from the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether oil companies have illegally pushed prices higher, and he has proposed charging oil companies a fee if they don't pump oil on federal land for which they hold leasing rights to drill.</p><p>The House committee's Democratic staff published a memo Monday questioning why rising gasoline prices at the pump have outpaced the increase of oil prices in commodity markets.</p><p>In 2008, when crude prices reached nearly $150 a barrel, average nationwide gasoline prices topped out at roughly $4.15 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This year crude prices haven't surpassed $130 a barrel, but gasoline prices averaged more than $4.30 a gallon for the entire month of March.</p><p>Ms. Watkins of Shell said in her prepared remarks that those gasoline prices are set not by the oil companies but by retailers, based on local market conditions including wages.</p><p>\"Because oil is a global commodity, Shell does not set or control the price of crude oil,\" she said. \"Similarly, Shell does not set or control the price that consumers pay.\"</p><p>Democrats plan to question oil executives about why they haven't worked to increase oil production in a time of shortfalls. The memo accuses oil companies of profiting and paying out shareholders at the expense of American families that could have benefited from reinvestment in more oil production.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How much do you blame the oil industry for high gasoline prices? What about Washington and independent market forces? Join the conversation below.</p><p>They cited a survey last month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in which half of the big companies that responded said they didn't intend to increase output by more than 5% this year despite higher oil prices. Most cited investor pressure as the top reason to limit their growth.</p><p>\"Many oil companies have elected to distribute their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchasing programs rather than investments in production,\" the memo said.</p><p>In his prepared remarks, Mr. Woods said more-efficient permitting in the U.S. would encourage more investment and boost domestic supply.</p><p>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com</p><p>Gas Prices, Oil Executives Take Center Stage at Congressional Hearing</p>",
