  "title": "World News: Venezuela Opposition to Change Tack",
  "text": "<p>\"We're getting very close to that consensus that the interim-government experiment didn't work and that a new structure is needed,\" a person close to the deliberations said.</p><p>In January 2019, the U.S. and dozens of other countries in Latin America and Europe recognized Mr. Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president. Mr. Maduro clung to power with the support of Russia, Iran and China.</p><p>Mr. Guaido, the 39-year-old head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said his movement has a constitutional mandate to continue in power until free and fair elections are held in the country, which are unlikely to happen before 2024.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported this month that the Biden administration is thinking about scaling down sanctions on the government of Venezuela to allow Chevron Corp. to resume pumping oil there, paving the way for a potential reopening of U.S. and European markets to oil exports from Venezuela. A deal, though, would be contingent on Mr. Maduro resuming long-suspended talks with opposition leaders in Mexico to discuss conditions needed to hold free and fair presidential elections, people familiar with the proposal said.</p><p>In Washington, there is opposition among Republicans and skepticism among influential Democrats who have worked on Venezuela policy and believe Mr. Maduro is unlikely to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>\"If the administration is headed on this path, there has to be real substantive benchmarks so that we know this isn't just a buy of time\" by the regime, Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a small group of American reporters during a visit to Colombia on Wednesday. \"I am skeptical but willing to be open to the concept of a real defined process that can lead to what we all desire.\"</p><p>The U.S. State Department didn't respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p>At the meetings at a Panama hotel last week, representatives from the main political parties said that while they agreed on scrapping Mr. Guaido's role, they had made little progress in determining how their movement would be led after January.</p><p>Party leaders said they want to establish a timetable for primary elections that the opposition intends to hold next year to pick a candidate to run against Mr. Maduro in a presidential race.</p>",
