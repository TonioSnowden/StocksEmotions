  "title": "Stock Futures Fall in Choppy Trading; Futures initially rose on optimism over the possibility of the U.S. easing tariffs on Chinese imports, but gains were short-lived",
  "text": "<p>U.S. stocks tend to perform well in July, history shows, but this year investors say they are bracing for more pain ahead. Traders are focused on stubborn inflation that has forced central banks around the world to aggressively tighten monetary policy. Economic data showing sharp declines in metrics ranging from factory output to retail spendinghave exacerbated concerns that the U.S. economy could tumble into a recession.</p><p>On Tuesday, reports that President Biden is expected to roll back some tariffs on Chinese imports provided stocks some relief, sending futures higher in early trading on hopes that the changes could help rein in inflation. But as the session continued, futures turned negative as concerns over economic growth overshadowed optimism over surrounding the tariffs.</p><p>\"The market is desperate for good news,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. But, he said, it has become increasingly difficult to offset investors' growing fears. Even with the possibility of a rollback of tariffs on the horizon, he said, investors are asking: \"How is going to solve the two key issues we have, which is mounting recession fears and strong inflation?\"</p><p>Tuesday's pullback in stocks sent investors flocking to assets perceived as safer. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies, advanced 0.8%, notching its highest intraday level in about 20 years.</p><p>The euro, in contrast, slipped 1.2%, falling to a nearly 20-year low on concerns that the eurozone may be nearing an energy shock that could tip the bloc into recession. The euro most recently traded at $1.0296, putting it within striking distance of reaching parity.</p><p>Elsewhere in markets, volatility was widespread. European gas prices rose to the highest level since March as oil workers in Norway went on strike, reducing output from Europe's second-biggest gas supplier after Russia at a time when energy markets are already squeezed. A benchmark for gas futures contracts in northwestern Europe climbed 14% to 172.88 euros per megawatt-hour on Tuesday.</p><p>In the bond market, meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note oscillated between small declines and gains. It recently traded at 2.895%, down from 2.901% Friday.</p><p>Investors this week are awaiting the release of the June jobs report data Friday, which will better shed insight into the trajectory of the U.S. economy. So far, the job market has shown little signs of faltering this year—offering one encouraging sign for the economy—even as other data in recent weeks have pointed to an economic slowdown.</p><p>Money-managers and strategists will also be monitoring developments surrounding the Biden administration's plans for tariffs and what impact it could have on inflation and the economy. On Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke by videoconference about topics including the tariffs, marking the first time the two policy makers have spoken since October 2021.</p><p>Economists say removing Chinese tariffs isn't likely to have a dramatic impact on inflation. And any rollback may not mark a fundamental change in the U.S.-China relationship or the countries' economic outlooks, some investors said.</p><p>\"The size of the tariff reduction may not fundamentally change the U.S. inflation or China export outlooks,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Société Générale. Investors might be focused on other tensions between the two countries, such as export and investment restrictions, he added.</p><p>In premarket trading in New York, energy stocks climbed. Occidental Petroleum rose 1.3%, Exxon Mobil gained 0.9% and Chevron advanced 0.6%.</p><p>Shares of Tesla fell 1% after the electric-car maker said Saturday that its vehicle deliveries fell quarter-over-quarter for the first time in more than two years after the company had to temporarily shut down its largest factory, in Shanghai, because of local Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6%. In Asia, trading was mixed. Stocks in China were little changed even after the virtual talks between China and the U.S. The benchmark Shanghai Composite reversed early losses to end roughly flat, while the CSI 300 index of the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen slipped 0.1%.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index added 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1%.</p><p>—Rebecca Feng and Anna Hirtenstein contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Fall in Choppy Trading</p>",
