  "text": "<p>I note that Exxon's second-quarter profit of near $18bn is $2bn more than its previous all-time high and a billion more than analysts had expected, but still the company's chief executive Darren Woods has admitted that “this situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine” (“Cash bonanza for Chevron and Exxon heightens backlash risk”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13f82093-1110-4c92-9fea-936067a5f29e\">Report</a>, July 30).</p> <p>By that classic corporate doublespeak, he really means his outscale profits were made better because of the ongoing war. You report that all the oil majors are seeing extraordinary profits — driven by current events.</p> <p>Investors buy the shares of one super oil major (Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total) over another because of a supposed belief in its superior strategy, management, capital allocation etc. </p> <p>Clever investors shouldn't buy an oil company stock simply to get oil exposure. If you just want exposure to the black stuff, the purist strategy should be to trade oil futures. </p> <p>Given this, it's only fair for these companies and their shareholders to pay a windfall tax which relates directly to the profits derived from the current oil price increase and not from the cleverness of management and deployment of their capital. </p> <p>In so doing, they justly give up some of the market beta of oil price rises, but keep the alpha of being a “better” stock than any of their competitors.</p> <p>This way, some of this current pricing bonanza can be passed back to hard-hit consumers who are on the “unlucky” side of the equation in this current oil price inflationary ride.</p> <p>It's only fair.</p> <p><strong>Charlie Metcalfe</strong> <br><em>Lisbon, Portugal</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: It's only fair for oil companies to pay profit-driven windfall tax' FT.com 1 August.
