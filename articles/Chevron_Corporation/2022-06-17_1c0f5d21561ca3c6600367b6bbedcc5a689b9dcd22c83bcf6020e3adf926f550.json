  "title": "George Weyerhaeuser, Child-Kidnapping Victim, Survived to Lead Forestry Giant; Executive, who has died at age 95, oversaw fast growth and diversified into diapers, hydroponic lettuce, mortgages",
  "text": "<p>After a ransom was paid, he was released late at night in a wooded area and found his way home, with help from more strangers. He grew up with few signs of trauma, graduated from Yale and worked for five decades at Weyerhaeuser Co., where he rose to chief executive.</p><p>As for the kidnapping, \"I don't think it bothered me unduly,\" he told Sports Illustrated in a 1969 interview, adding that a boy \"is a pretty adaptable organism. He can adjust himself to conditions in a way no adult could.\"</p><p>Mr. Weyerhaeuser, who died June 11 at the age of 95, oversaw a long period of rapid growth and diversification as chief executive from 1966 to 1991. Sales in his final year as CEO were more than 10 times the level of his first year. He remained chairman until 1999.</p><p>He reduced reliance on the Northwest by buying 1.8 million acres in Arkansas and Oklahoma and extended operations in the Southeast and Canada. In 1971, he moved his staff into a sylvan lakeside headquarters in Federal Way, Wash., with open-plan offices, then a novelty. He expanded exports to Japan and made Weyerhaeuser a leader in store-brand disposable diapers. He increased investments in home-building and mortgage lending.</p><p>Mr. Weyerhaeuser also presented the company as a responsible steward of timberlands and occasionally won grudging praise from environmentalists. \"I guess you could say Weyerhaeuser is the best of one of the most destructive industries in the U.S.,\" a Friends of the Earth official told the New York Times in 1983.</p><p>George Hunt Walker Weyerhaeuser, born July 8, 1926, was a great grandson of Frederick Weyerhaeuser, a German immigrant who amassed timberlands in Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest. Young George spent his early years mostly in Lewiston, Idaho, before the family moved to Tacoma. His father, J.P. \"Phil\" Weyerhaeuser Jr., eventually headed the company.</p><p>After the kidnapping, swarms of journalists sought the victim's inside story. He recalled his father's fury when a photographer rushed up to take a picture: \"He reached out, took that guy's camera, smashed it and took a punch at him.\"</p><p>Sent to the Taft prep school in Connecticut, the young man honed his tennis and academic skills. He found Latin baffling but relished math. After starting his studies at Yale, he was drafted into the Navy and trained as an electronics technician. By the time he was sent out to sea, the war was ending. He returned to Yale in 1946 and spent a summer on a logging crew.</p><p>In 1948, he married Wendy Wagner, a sister of one of his childhood friends. After completing his degree in industrial administration early in 1949, he joined the family company. Starting with menial jobs at a pulp mill, he became a foreman, moved to a lumber mill and began working his way through the management ranks.</p><p>A love of nature influenced his policies. Before systematic reforestation was adopted, he said, \"It would just make you sick to go into some of those stands and see what was left when we got through logging. It was just unbelievable.\"</p><p>As a CEO, he experimented with ventures including garden supplies, hydroponic lettuce and salmon farming that didn't pan out. After he retired, the company narrowed its focus and sold its home-building business, as well as units making paper and containerboard packaging.</p><p>Mr. Weyerhaeuser also served as a director of Boeing Co. and Chevron Corp. Starting with gifts from Japanese partners, he created a bonsai museum in Federal Way.</p><p>His wife, Wendy Weyerhaeuser, died in 2014. He is survived by five children, 15 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren.</p><p>The three people involved in kidnapping him eventually were sentenced to prison. One of them, Harmon Metz Waley, wrote to Mr. Weyerhaeuser to apologize. Mr. Weyerhaeuser found a truck-driving job at the company for Mr. Waley when he got out of prison. \"I would be hard-pressed to call him a close friend,\" Mr. Weyerhaeuser said in the oral history, \"but I kind of like him. And I think vice versa. He sends me a card once in a while.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
