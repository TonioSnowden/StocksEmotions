  "title": "Asian Markets Fall Sharply, But Some Stocks Outperform",
  "text": "<p>By early afternoon Monday Hong Kong time, futures tied to Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 had declined between 1.1% and 1.8%, suggesting U.S. markets could come under pressure in Monday's trading. Futures tied to Europes Euro Stoxx 50 index fell more than 3%.</p><p>Stock benchmarks in the Asia-Pacific region fell sharply Monday, with South Korea's Kospi and the mainland Chinese CSI 300 both falling more than 2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 shed more than 3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell more than 4%, putting it on pace to close at a multiyear low.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose or fell at least 1% in six of the past nine trading days as anxieties over the war in Ukraine, high inflation and the path of interest rates buffet the market.</p><p>The benchmark U.S. stock index recently suffered its first correction, or decline of at least 10% from a recent high, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is now down 9.2% this year, including last week's 1.3% fall.</p><p>Despite the volatility, a variety of individual stocks have broken out.</p><p>Among those setting records last week were candy maker Hershey Co., oil giant Chevron Corp., railroad company Union Pacific Corp., drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. and conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p><p>Many investors see reason for optimism when stocks from different corners of the market rally simultaneously. Such moves hint at the underpinnings of a durable advance, even when that has yet to materialize at the level of major stock indexes. That contrasts with periods in recent years when big technology stocks lifted the market while other sectors languished.</p><p>\"That can't sustain itself forever, so I think that's been a healthy development,\" said Hank Smith, head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust. Even with the recent down week, \"what you're seeing is there is buying power out there.\"</p><p>Tech shares pulled back this year as the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates weighs on the high value that investors assigned to those companies' future earnings. The losses in sectors ranging from industrials to financials to healthcare have been less severe, and the energy group has shot higher.</p><p>In one sign of the outsize influence of big tech companies, the S&amp;P 500, which is weighted by market value, is lagging behind a version of the index in which each constituent is equally weighted. The S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index is down 5.9% in 2022.</p><p>Investors this week will scrutinize new inflation data ahead of the central bank meeting, which begins March 15. They also will parse earnings reports from Campbell Soup Co., Ulta Beauty Inc. and software company Oracle Corp. for insights on cost pressures and customer demand.</p><p>While the recent stock-market declines might make investors cringe, some point to signs that shares are poised for a rebound.</p><p>Profits among big U.S. companies are expected to grow more than 8% from 2021, and the stock market looks less expensive than it has since the early days of the pandemic in the wake of the recent selloff. The widespread selling on geopolitical news shows a rush from risk but not fundamental weakness that would weigh on stocks longer term, these investors said.</p><p>\"It doesn't feel good right now, but it points to the potential for that breadth to improve markedly,\" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at SVB Private Bank.</p><p>On Wednesday, for example, more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 advanced after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he would propose raising interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point this month.</p><p>Some investors had feared the Fed might raise rates by half a point. Higher rates tend to pressure stock valuations by reducing investors' risk appetite and denting the value analysts assign to companies' future earnings.</p><p>To be sure, other technical indicators have been bleak. The market's drawdown has been so widespread that the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages recently hit its lowest level since May 2020.</p><p>And in late February, the 15-day moving average of the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks declining in a trading session hit one of its highest levels since March 2020, according to brokerage Instinet.</p><p>It is too soon to know just how effects of the war in Ukraine and ensuing sanctions against Russia will ripple through the global economy. The prices of commodities from wheat to corn to aluminum have hit multiyear highs, and oil has surged above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Gas prices have topped $5 a gallon in some parts of the country.</p><p>Mr. Powell said on Thursday that Russia's invasion was likely to push up inflation. He indicated the Fed wouldn't tolerate a significant period of higher inflation, even if that meant choking off economic growth.</p>",
