  "text": "<p>But meanwhile, investors should prepare for more boardroom dramas centered on climate policy—and be ready for much more muscular pressure from green capital.</p><p>Australia's AGL Energy Ltd. on Monday said that it would withdraw its proposal to split into two and that more than half its seven-person board—including the chairman and chief executive officer—would step down. Top shareholder and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who co-founded Nasdaq-listed software company Atlassian Corp., opposed the breakup plan.</p><p>The back story: Mr. Cannon-Brookes had partnered with Canada's Brookfield Asset Management earlier this year to try to take over the company, but AGL rejected their bid. The consortium had planned to shut down AGL's coal plants early and replace them with cleaner-energy sources and power storage. AGL's power generation assets currently run mostly on fossil fuels such as coal.</p><p>Following the initial brush off from AGL, Mr. Cannon-Brookes became AGL's largest shareholder this month with a more than 11% stake. Some other AGL investors, including pension fund Hesta, also opposed the management's plan.</p><p>Mr. Cannon-Brookes will now seek to put two representatives on AGL's board. He says that rather than breaking up, the company should speed up the shutdown of its coal plants and the development of renewable projects—as the original consortium had proposed.</p><p>The shake-up at AGL, which is the largest carbon emitter in Australia, shows that shareholder activism—and even proxy fights—over climate policy will become more common, even at less known big carbon emitters like AGL. And while Mr. Cannon-Brookes is undoubtedly concerned about climate change, he also had to make a business case to investors.</p><p>Increasing use of renewables, especially rooftop solar, in Australia has posed a challenge to traditional power companies. Wholesale electricity prices had tumbled in recent years before soaring fuel costs sent them higher over the past year. Shares of AGL have plunged 70% since their peak in 2017.</p><p>Mr. Cannon-Brookes argued the split could make AGL's transition to renewables harder as the stranded coal assets could struggle to finance new power capacity on their own. He believes keeping the entire company intact—with its big customer base and data—is the best way to deliver the energy transition, and a long-term future for the company. Apparently, a significant number of AGL's big shareholders agree.</p><p>As climate activism moves from the street to the boardroom, investors are putting money where their mouth is—even oil giants like Exxon and Chevron have had to accommodate demands from activist investors for board seats or other policy changes.</p><p>The next test is to see if they can really do well by doing good.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Green Capital Scores Against Coal in Australia</p>",
