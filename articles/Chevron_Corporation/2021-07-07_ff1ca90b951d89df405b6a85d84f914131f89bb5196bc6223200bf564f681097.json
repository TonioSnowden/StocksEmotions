  "text": "<p><strong>One chart to start: </strong>Didi Chuxing lost a fifth of its market value after Chinese regulators announced an investigation into the ride-hailing app that last week raised more than $4bn in a New York listing. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/095eb7ac-09ea-4a5c-8253-d8ca2d945614\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Big bank, tiny M&amp;A</h2> <p>Speaking at a conference last month, <strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> was asked whether the bank would be one of the winners in the battle to thrive in an increasingly competitive banking system.</p> <p>“We'll do whatever it takes,” he replied. Perhaps, to be more precise, Dimon could've said he'll do whatever deal it takes.</p> <p>JPMorgan has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d54b3a-b1e9-4f99-8ebd-3ec84a3ca1e5\">already made</a> 33 acquisitions or investments in 2021, just one shy of its total in both 2020 and 2019. This has put America's biggest bank by assets on track for its largest buying spree in years.</p> <p>The deals so far this year are mostly for smaller companies, often with a bent towards technology, and in locations ranging from Britain to Brazil.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a sign of how Dimon is turning to deals to expand the huge banking group at a time of low rates and increasing competition from old and new banking players including <strong>PayPal</strong> and<strong> Visa</strong>, whose market capitalisations have exceeded $340bn.</p> <p>As one<strong> Wells Fargo</strong> analyst put it: “It's a string of pearls approach where they buy smaller fintech firms to better advance the asset management business with lower cultural, operating and goodwill hurdles than come with a large acquisition.”</p> <p>The prices of most of the deals were not publicly disclosed. Some notable ones though include a roughly $700m deal for the UK digital wealth management platform <strong>Nutmeg</strong>, and a 10 per cent stake in <strong>China Merchants Bank</strong>'s wealth management business for roughly $410m.</p> <p>One area where JPMorgan has indicated a willingness to do larger deals is asset management. The bank lost out to <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> last year in the $7bn bidding war for US investment manager <strong>Eaton Vance</strong>.</p> <p>For Dimon, who has sat at the helm of the lender since 2005, the dealmaking marks a return to his roots on Wall Street, where he served as chief lieutenant to <strong>Sandy Weill </strong>during a series of acquisitions that led to the creation of <strong>Citigroup</strong>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>But as Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3599aa54-1491-4958-a370-d751f6a7e5c2?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">points out</a>, the volume of deals pale in comparison to the bank's $460bn market cap. Dimon may be charting a more aggressive dealmaking strategy than in the past, but only as much as the intense regulation placed upon traditional banking allows.</p> <h2>Does selling off oil assets help the environment? Likely not&#xa0;</h2> <p>Under pressure from investors and activists, some of the world's biggest oil companies have pledged to go “net zero” and are dumping billions of dollars in fossil fuel assets to make good on their promises.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>ExxonMobil</strong> and<strong> Chevron</strong> in the US, along with <strong>BP</strong>, <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>, <strong>Total </strong>and<strong> Eni </strong>in Europe have sold $28.1bn in assets since 2018 alone, and plan to target further disposals of more than $30bn in the coming years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Across the industry, the total value of oil and gas assets up for sale are even higher at more than $140bn, according to energy consultancy <strong>Wood Mackenzie</strong>.</p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9e8e721-6d1c-4513-9034-3f6d99d983b8\">investors and activists</a> impatiently awaiting a more aggressive response to climate change, that should be good news. But as the FT's Anjli Raval investigates in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4dee7080-3a1b-479f-a50c-c3641c82c142\">this Big Read</a>, a pivotal question looms: where do all those assets go? And does it actually curb emissions?&#xa0;</p> <p>A growing faction of smaller private players, independent producers armed with funding from private equity, opaque energy traders and state oil companies, are happy to step in. Their logic? Just because <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bf04fff-5b2f-4d96-a4ea-ff55e029f18e\">political pressure</a> to curb emissions has risen, demand for fossil fuels has barely budged and there is money to be made.&#xa0;</p> <p>“These operational assets will mint money like you have no idea over the next three to five years,” <strong>Laurent Segalen</strong>, a clean energy investment banker and managing partner at Megawatt-X, told Anjli. “Hedge funds, private equity, companies you have never heard of, will pick these assets off.”</p> <p><strong>Ineos Energy</strong>, an arm of the private <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31b5e7e0-5c76-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4\">UK chemicals company</a> that has bought <strong>Hess Corporation</strong>'s oil and gas assets in Denmark for $150m, is among the newly energised opportunists.</p> <p>“We have an appetite to acquire,” Brian Gilvary, the former BP chief financial officer who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8f8b3ca-257b-4efe-8c5b-7838a1de558e\">joined</a> Ineos in December, told the FT, adding that the group is eyeing “much bigger” multibillion-dollar deals.</p> <p>Some energy executives even think that environmentalists and investors are spending a disproportionate amount of time targeting the listed oil majors at the expense of the wider energy ecosystem.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We spend all this time focusing on BP and Shell . . . what about <strong>Saudi Aramco</strong> and <strong>Adnoc </strong>[Abu Dhabi National Oil Company]?”, said <strong>Angela Wilkinson</strong>, head of the <strong>World Energy Council</strong>.</p> <p>Only a few state oil companies have set net-zero ambitions. Russia's<strong> Gazprom</strong> has refused to set any corporate emissions targets, while Saudi Arabia's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/264b6258-8c1c-4154-8330-3447a4ab00d0\">energy minister</a>, <strong>Abdulaziz bin Salman</strong>, has seized the moment as an opportunity to increase the country's own market share.</p> <p>While assets may change hands, appetite to plough endless funds into oil and gas production is waning. The result is that supply shortages could loom at a time when consumption is still robust.</p> <p>As one banker put it: “You're not addressing the demand side while you're cutting supply. Economics 101 states that [oil] prices are going to go up.”</p> <p>For those assets that oil executives want to keep, they find clever ways — from joint ventures, to spin-offs, to listing a parallel vehicle on the stock market — to take debt as well as emissions off their balance sheets.&#xa0;</p> <p>The goal: take advantage of their most controversial assets while they still can.</p> <h2>Glencore: succession is in session</h2> <p>Much like Glencore's share price over the past decade, <strong>Ivan Glasenberg</strong>'s public approval rating has had its ups and downs.</p> <p>Since he entered the top job at the coal miner in 2002, the 63-year-old hard-nosed former trader has navigated his fair share of highs (the company's 2011 <strong>London Stock Exchange </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c687f45c-761c-11e0-b4f7-00144feabdc0\">debut</a> and subsequent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d355d82-b31a-11e2-95b3-00144feabdc0\">takeover</a> of rival <strong>Xstrata</strong>) and lows (a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/893f1ed2-4e17-11e4-bfda-00144feab7de\">rebuffed bid for Rio Tinto</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/459ef70a-4a43-11e5-b558-8a9722977189\">commodity crashes</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf84900a-1764-11ea-8d73-6303645ac406\">investigation</a> into bribery and corruption).</p> <p>Now, as<strong> Glasenberg</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/222c1671-ef26-49c6-b2b7-46af2b0a90df\">ushers in</a> his successor<strong> Gary Nagle</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c5b110e-1073-11e6-839f-2922947098f0\">new chair</a> <strong>Kalidas Madhavpeddi</strong>, investors are watching to see if the duo has what it takes to salvage Glencore's stock price, down 40 per cent since the 2011 IPO, and reach its lengthy goal of a 50 per cent reduction in its total emissions by 2035 — mainly by using its coal mines as a source of cash to produce cleaner materials such as nickel, copper and cobalt.</p> <p>They'll also have to do so while remaining on the good side of Glasenberg and his former lieutenants, who still control about 25 per cent of the company.</p> <p>Looks like they better start digging.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>PR group <strong>Teneo</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e709f723-325d-447c-b1bb-c3b52a6dc697\">has named</a> former <strong>Xerox</strong> chief executive <strong>Ursula Burns </strong>as its new chair following the resignation of its co-founder, chief executive and chair <strong>Declan Kelly </strong>last week.
