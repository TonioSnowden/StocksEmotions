  "title": "Strike at Machinery Maker CNH Industrial Grinds On as Talks Stall; Workers for the farm and construction machinery company want bigger raises and longer contract; company urges vote on recent offer",
  "text": "<p>CNH, whose brands include Case IH and New Holland, is the second-largest farm equipment manufacturer in the U.S. behind Deere &amp; Co., based on sales. About 1,100 hourly workers in Burlington, Iowa, and Racine, Wis., have been on strike since May 2 at the company, which in 2021 sold about $18 billion worth of tractors, excavators and other farm and construction equipment world-wide.</p><p>The UAW wants higher wages and a longer contract than the company has offered. The union said the wage increases proposed by the company would be eaten up by the higher costs the company wants employees to shoulder for health insurance.</p><p>\"This deal has to sell itself and right now it's not selling itself,\" said Nick Guernsey, president of the union local in Burlington, where CNH produces Case-brand construction equipment, including backhoes, and components.</p><p>CNH said UAW negotiators rejected the company's last major proposal in May without putting it before rank-and-file members. \"We strongly encourage the UAW to present our offer to our employees for a vote,\" the company said.</p><p>CNH, like other equipment manufacturers, has struggled to obtain semiconductors and other key components in short supply during the past 18 months. New equipment fresh off assembly lines has languished at CNH's plants waiting for parts to complete them. Some dealers said the strike has further lengthened wait times for new machinery and components.</p><p>\"The strike has made it worse,\" said Rod Bierle, manager at Bancroft Implement, a Case IH dealer in Iowa. \"They need to settle the strike. We're waiting for tractors.\"</p><p>The Racine plant assembles high-horsepower farm tractors and produces axle and transmission components for CNH's farm equipment.</p><p>CNH is one of several large companies in the U.S. where unionized workers have struck in the past year to obtain higher wages and better benefits at a time of rising inflation and a tight labor market. Others included Kellogg Co., Chevron Corp. and Deere, where 10,000 members of the UAW went on strikefor more than a month last fall.</p><p>The strike at Deere, the first at the company in 35 years, raised worries across the Farm Belt about further snarls in equipment deliveries, and higher prices for machinery from stretched supply chains and higher costs for components and materials. Farmers' other costs, including for fertilizer, also have surged this year.</p><p>Deere workers agreed to a six-year contract with wage increases and lump-sum bonuses that Deere said would cost the company $3.5 billion. UAW members at CNH said they have turned down a three-year contract with wage increases totaling 18.5% for assembly line workers, machinists, welders and other lower skilled workers.</p><p>Mr. Guernsey said the union wants a six-year contract that elevates workers' hourly rates to the same levels as employees at CNH's six nonunion U.S. plants, plus a raise on top of that. The UAW estimates that hourly nonunion workers for CNH make an average of about $5.50 an hour more than unionized workers at the Racine and Burlington plants. The company said pay rates for individual plants are based on labor rates in the communities where plants are located.</p><p>CNH said it can't support a six-year deal because of the uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. economy in the coming years.</p><p>\"It appears the country is on the brink of a recession,\" the company said. \"A long-term contract would not be a sound business decision.\"</p><p>Mr. Guernsey said UAW members ended up taking pay cuts after their last strike in late 2004. The short-lived walkout turned into a four-month lockout when the company refused to allow workers to return to their jobs without agreeing to a new contract.</p><p>When the current strike started in May, CNH brought in hundreds of temporary workers to man operations at the Burlington and Racine plants. Union leaders estimate production output from the plants has fallen significantly because many of the replacement workers lack the skills needed to operate machinery. The UAW said the strike is affecting production at other plants as well, because they use components from the plants on strike. The company declined to provide details about its production volumes.</p><p>\"Our customers need our products,\" the company said. Using replacements \"was the only prudent business decision.\"</p><p>Mr. Bierle said his Iowa dealership has stepped up its purchases of used equipment in recent months and is selling it to farmers who haven't been able to get new models.</p><p>\"We're using a Band-Aid to take care of these guys,\" he said. \"Fortunately, there's a lot of used equipment in the U.S.\"</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>Strike at Machinery Maker CNH Industrial Grinds On as Talks Stall</p>",
