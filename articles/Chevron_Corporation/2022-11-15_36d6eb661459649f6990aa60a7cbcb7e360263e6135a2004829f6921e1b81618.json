Semiconductor manufacturing has traditionally been a cyclical business and TSM is the highest-volume producer of computer chips in the world.</p><p>Semiconductor stocks tumbled as investors perceived the group had entered a down cycle. The iShares Semiconductor ETF hit its 2022 closing low on Oct. 14 when it was down 44% for the year, before rising 25% through Nov. 14.</p><p>When SOXX hit bottom, Taiwan Semiconductor had been hit even harder, with a 46% decline, possibly reflecting tensions between China and the U.S. over China's claim to Taiwan. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.)</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor fell to its 2022 low on Nov. 3 when it was down 49% for the year. Berkshire built its position in TSM some time between June 30, when the stock was down 35% for 2022, and Sept. 30, when it was down 41% for the year.</p><p>It appears Buffett's timing was excellent, following a part of the long-term strategy he discussed in his annual letter to shareholders that was included with Berkshire's 1986 annual report. Buffett explained that market disruptions were unpredictable.</p><p>\"Our goal is more modest: We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful,\" he wrote.</p><p>You can see the full list of Buffett's letters to shareholders here.</p><p>And now, with President Biden saying he doesn't expect a quick attempt by China to invade Taiwan after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, followed by Berkshire's disclosure (both on Nov. 14), shares of TSM were soaring on Nov. 15.</p><p>Read: Quality and high dividends set these five semiconductor stocks apart from poorer-performing competitors</p><p>Other stocks Berkshire added to, sold or trimmed</p><p>During the third quarter, Berkshire added to its holdings of the following stocks.
