  "text": "<p>In premarket trading, Apple shares rose 4.9% after the biggest U.S. company by market capitalization posted record revenue and profits. Shares of brokerage Robinhood Markets, which reported a quarterly loss of $423 million, dropped 14% premarket. Tesla recovered 1.9% premarket after sliding 12% Thursday, highlighting the volatility wracking technology and growth stocks as investors prepare for the Fed to tighten monetary policy.</p><p>Chairman Jerome Powell added to expectations the central bank will start a series of interest-rate increases in March after the Fed's policy meeting Wednesday. His comments pushed up yields on short-term government bonds, boosted the dollar and injected renewed turbulence into a stock market that has grown accustomed to monetary stimulus.</p><p>\"Cheap money is like a comfort blanket for investors and for markets,\" said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank. \"Almost inevitably, you start to withdraw some of that cheap money and you're going to have more volatility in the markets.\"</p><p>The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against other major currencies, rose 0.1% Friday. Up 1.8% for the week, it was on course for its biggest gain since June.</p><p>Government-bond prices fell, pushing up prices. The yield on interest-rate sensitive two-year Treasury notes ticked up to 1.212% from 1.190% Thursday and 0.993% at the end of last week. Yields on 10-year notes haven't risen as fast, which some analysts interpret as a sign investors think interest-rate rises by the Fed will squelch economic growth. They stood at 1.831% Friday, up from 1.747% a week ago.</p><p>Stocks have been choppy despite another solid round of earnings. Almost a third of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 have reported fourth-quarter results and 78% of them have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share, according to FactSet. Companies due to report before the bell Friday include Chevron, Caterpillar and Colgate-Palmolive.</p><p>Investors will parse consumer-spending data from the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the figures to show spending fell in December as rising coronavirus infections dented demand. Also due at 8:30 a.m., the Fed's preferred inflation gauge is forecast to show a continuation of the price pressures that have pushed the central bank to unwind stimulus.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500, Dow on Track for Fourth Weekly Loss</p>",
