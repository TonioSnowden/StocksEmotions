  "title": "U.S. Allows Chevron to Maintain Venezuela Operations but Won't Permit Drilling; License extension seeks to encourage talks between Maduro government and opposition",
  "text": "<p>The extension of the license allows Chevron to have talks with Petróleos de Venezuela SA, the state-owned oil company with which it has a joint venture. Previously the company couldn't directly negotiate with any officials sanctioned by the U.S. Chevron has been lobbying the U.S. to permit it to drill for crude and sell it in the world market to help bring down energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The move by the U.S. appears to be a reply to a meeting by senior U.S. officials with Mr. Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials in March. As a result of those meetings, the Maduro government freed two U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela.</p><p>The senior U.S. officials emphasized Tuesday that the U.S. was acting at the request of the government of opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized as interim president of Venezuela by the U.S. After the March meetings in Caracas, Mr. Guaidó and others in the Venezuelan opposition feared that their aspirations for a restoration of democracy in the country would be sacrificed by the Biden administration's need to increase world oil production to lower oil prices.</p><p>The officials denied that the action had anything to do with the world energy situation. \"Our focus has been on supporting the interim government…to get the regime to take steps towards free and fair elections through negotiations,\" one official said. \"That has been the focus entirely, not the oil sector or not oil prices.\"</p><p>The officials said the U.S. would calibrate its sanctions policy to respond to \"ambitious concrete and irreversible\" moves by the Maduro government toward the holding of free elections. \"We will reapply sanctions on the basis of any steps backward,\" the official said.</p><p>Write to José de Córdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com and Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Allows Chevron to Maintain Venezuela Operations but Won't Permit Drilling</p>",
