  "title": "Investors Put Forward More Proposals, Dialing Up Pressure on Companies; Apple, Activision Blizzard and Chevron saw proposals gain considerable support in this year's proxy season",
  "text": "<p>Already, shareholder proposal numbers are on the rise. Investors submitted 650 proposals to S&amp;P 500 companies as of July 29, up from 613 proposals and 556 proposals during the same period in 2021 and 2020, respectively, according to Esgauge, a data analytics firm. All but 12 proposals this year were related to environmental, social and governance issues, the data shows.</p><p>Last month, the SEC proposed additional changes, which aren't yet in effect.</p><p>\"These changes will make it more challenging to get shareholder proposals excluded,\" said Laura Richman, counsel at law firm Mayer Brown, who didn't speak about specific proposals. \"So we may see more of them next year.\"</p><p>Companies have to spend more time and money to engage with investors as they submit more proposals and become more prescriptive in what they are asking for, lawyers said. The latter is resulting in a lower percentage of proposals gaining majority support. It dropped to 10.6% this year from 16.2% last year, according to Esgauge.</p><p>\"Investors got more ambitious in the prescriptiveness of their proposals, and therefore they lost some support,\" said Marc Gerber, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP, who didn't speak about specific companies or proposals. \"But there were plenty of proposals that didn't get too prescriptive, that still garnered significant support.\"</p><p>Technology giant Apple Inc. and videogame company Activision Blizzard Inc. in this year's proxy season were pressed to review some of their corporate practices and policies, while Alaska Air Group Inc., an airline holding company, was asked to seek shareholder approval for severance payouts. At Chevron Corp., shareholders requested the energy company issue a report on its methane emissions.</p><p>Most shareholder proposals are nonbinding and don't require action from a company. But if they gain majority or even significant support—or about 25% to 30% of votes—investors expect companies to act.</p><p>\"In our view, when a proposal has received a solid level of support from investors, that should generally be a signal to the board that this is a material issue to investors and something that they should look into,\" said Derek Butcher, senior manager for corporate governance and responsible investment at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., an asset manager.</p><p>San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron engaged with shareholders this spring on a proposal to provide more information about methane emissions, said Michael Rubio, director of sustainability at Chevron. After the engagement, the board assessed—and ultimately supported—the proposal because the company agreed with the goal, Mr. Rubio said.</p><p>The proposal, which showed up on Chevron's April 7 proxy statement, received 98% support from shareholders. Mr. Rubio declined to comment on the costs associated with engaging with shareholders and producing the report on methane emissions, which is set to be released by the end of the year. Whether Chevron's board will adopt a similar strategy for future proposals depends on shareholders' demands, he said.</p><p>\"As the board evaluates the narrative of each shareholder proposal, it'll go through its process and determine if we could find a win-win opportunity,\" Mr. Rubio said. \"We welcome the engagement and the enhanced discussion.\"</p><p>James McRitchie, an individual investor in close to 200 companies, said he submitted around 80 shareholder proposals this year. Roughly 30 of those were resolved by agreements with the companies before the annual meetings were held. Companies were able to exclude another 12 from their proxies, he said. The rest were either voted on or will be voted on at coming meetings.</p><p>Shareholder proposals have naturally become more prescriptive in recent years, Mr. McRitchie said. If a company says it will reduce emissions by 2050, the next step for an investor might be to ask a company for a report on how it will get there, he said.</p><p>BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager with about $8.5 trillion under management as of June 30, said in a report last week that it supported fewer climate-related proposals this year. The company in part attributed the decline to \"more prescriptive\" proposals and declined to comment beyond its report.</p><p>Boards often recommend that investors vote against their shareholders' proposals, typically noting that a company is already working on the issue or that what is asked for isn't in shareholders' best interest. This was the case at Apple, which recommended voting against a proposal that sought a third-party assessment on how the company's policies and practices adversely affect matters such as gender and racial equity among employees. After roughly 54% of shareholders backed the proposal, Apple in April committed to conducting a civil rights audit. The company declined to comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard said in June that it would consider a proposal asking for a public report on the company's efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination, after it initially recommended that investors vote against it.</p><p>Shareholders sought greater transparency on these issues following a California regulatory agency's lawsuit against the company last year alleging widespread sexual harassment. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick knew about the allegations and didn't tell the company's board members. The company said in June that an internal review didn't reveal any evidence that senior executives played down or ignored reports of harassment.</p><p>After the shareholder proposal received around 67% support at the June annual meeting, the company said it would \"carefully consider\" the proposal. The company declined to comment beyond the statement released after the annual meeting.</p><p>At Alaska Air, shareholders at the May annual meeting requested the board to seek approval for any senior managers' new or renewed pay package that would provide for severance or termination payments above a certain amount. While the board recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, it received nearly 55% support. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Companies should expect an increase in proposals for next year's proxy season, said Skadden's Mr. Gerber. Shareholders will also likely tweak proposals that received less voting support than anticipated in this year's proxy season, he said. \"I think they'll make adjustments and perhaps be less prescriptive in an effort to get even more shareholder voting support,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Williams-Alvarez at jennifer.williams-alvarez@wsj.com</p><p>Investors Put Forward More Proposals, Dialing Up Pressure on Companies</p>",
