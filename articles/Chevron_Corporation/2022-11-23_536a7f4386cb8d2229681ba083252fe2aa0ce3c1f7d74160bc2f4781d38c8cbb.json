  "title": "U.S. Poised to Grant Chevron License to Pump Oil in Venezuela; Move would come just as Western sanctions on Russia threaten to tighten global supplies",
  "text": "<p>Granting the new license is contingent on the Venezuelan government and its political opponents' announcement, expected Saturday, to implement a $3 billion humanitarian program program using Venezuelan funds unfrozen by the U.S. as well as an agreement to resume talks in Mexico City next month on resolving the country's political crisis through free and fair elections, people familiar with the matter said. The talks would quickly set in motion U.S. authorization for Chevron's return to Venezuela's oil fields, according to the people.</p><p>The license, which isn't permanent and will need future renewal, would return Chevron's latitude in Venezuela to a sanctions framework similar to one in effect in 2019, before the Trump administration clamped down further on Chevron's activities as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign aimed at ousting the government of Venezuela's Nicol√°s Maduro.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in October the Biden administration was preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime to allow Chevron to resume pumping oil there, paving the way for a potential reopening of international markets to oil exports from Venezuela.</p><p>Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that Chevron could soon win U.S. approval to vastly expand operations in Venezuela.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Poised to Grant Chevron License to Pump Oil in Venezuela</p>",
