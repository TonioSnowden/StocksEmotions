  "text": "<p>Norwegian state-controlled telecoms operator Telenor has become the latest highest-profile company to exit Myanmar following the military coup in February, selling its business in the country to a Lebanese family investment group.</p> <p>The Norwegian group, which had been under growing pressure as the military junta in Myanmar restricted internet access amid a broader crackdown, <a href=\"https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/telenor-group-sells-telenor-myanmar-to-m1-group%e2%80%af\">said on Thursday</a> that it had sold its local operations for $105m to M1 Group, an investment company founded by a former Lebanese prime minister and his brother.</p> <p>“The situation in Myanmar has over the past months become increasingly challenging for Telenor for people security, regulatory and compliance reasons. We have evaluated all options and believe a sale of the company is the best possible solution,” said Telenor chief executive, Sigve Brekke.</p> <p>Telenor, which was granted a licence in 2013 to operate in Myanmar, where it was seen as a cornerstone foreign investor, and its exit will be a blow to the military leaders' efforts to maintain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7632c1b0-4581-434f-86d6-bdceaff8e947\">business confidence</a>.</p> <p>Japanese brewer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f73a1d4-e9c9-41e0-90d8-bb05cf4e3b1b\">Kirin</a> and South Korean steelmaker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc20f766-9e39-4b4d-9c4f-c793f9ab09bb\">Posco</a> have both announced that they would exit joint ventures with Myanmar military-controlled conglomerates, but oil groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ccb846b-e0bd-4e7f-8055-971b930ee130\">Chevron and Total</a> remain investors in the main gasfield.</p> <p>The Norwegian group had already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1f8db9-e2d1-4e45-80be-1f6f6fe1344b\">written off</a> its entire $780m investment in the country in May, but said then that it believed it could still “make a difference” in Myanmar.</p> <p>Brekke told the Financial Times then that the dilemma for Telenor was “how can we operate in a country with military dictatorship without jeopardising our values?” </p> <p>On Thursday, he told the FT: “It's a sad day, no doubt about that. Both because it's been a reasonably good investment . . . And even more than that, we have seen the way we have contributed to the development of the country.”</p> <p>M1 has long been active in Myanmar and was a stakeholder in IGT, a big telecoms tower operator in the country, before it <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/irrawaddy-green-towers-limited-sale-of-company-301191212.html\">sold out</a> to private equity firm CVC at the start of this year. </p> <p>M1 was founded by brothers Taha and Najib Mikati. Najib was prime minister of Lebanon on two separate occasions.</p> <p>The Mikati brothers, judged by Forbes to have fortunes of $2.7bn each, have based their success on telecoms businesses in Lebanon and throughout Africa.</p> <p>M1 will pay Telenor $50m now and a $55m deferred payment over the next five years. Telenor, which invested NKr5.3bn ($604m) in Myanmar over seven years, and which took out NKr3.2bn in dividends more recently, said the deal implied an enterprise value of $600m due to debt and future liabilities.</p> <p>Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-after-pressuring-telecom-firms-myanmars-junta-bans-executives-leaving-2021-07-05/\">reported</a> this week that Myanmar's military junta had told senior foreign telecoms executives not to leave the country without permission. Telenor declined to comment.</p> <p>Telenor and other telecoms groups in Myanmar, which include Qatar's Ooredoo and military-backed operators, had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e03cfc01-cf06-487d-8c45-0944f21c733a\">forced to cut off</a> mobile and internet services by the junta. The Norwegian group registered a “strong protest” against the crackdown and spoke out against a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d09f398e-60f5-4f63-99b0-22e1f4edbb09\">new cyber security law</a> that will give the regime sweeping powers over digital content.</p> <p>“The last two months all three areas [safety of employees, regulatory and compliance concerns] have worsened. We don't see any improvements,” Brekke said, adding that it had been “important for Telenor to stand up for our values”.</p> <p><em>This story has been amended to remove a reference to Hizbollah.</em></p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic correspondent 2021 'Telenor exits Myanmar after military coup' FT.com 8 July.
