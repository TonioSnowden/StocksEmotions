Germany and Austria are now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/myft/following/17551dab-9c33-4e1a-9832-cca0a3fd0659\">planning for gas rationing</a> as a dispute with Russia over payment for its energy deepens. It is another crisis on top of the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine, where Russia's invasion continues despite Moscow claiming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6afc2715-3f4e-48fc-bbb6-5a50b54f7e4b\">progress</a> in peace talks with Kyiv.</p> <p>The oil market remained sceptical too, with international benchmark Brent settling up almost 3 per cent at $113.45 a barrel on Wednesday. But European gas prices shot up by more than 11 per cent, to more than €118 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>In today's newsletter, Myles and Justin dig into a probe launched by the Biden administration into whether solar developers are dodging tariffs on part imports. The industry has blasted the investigation as “devastating” and says it will trigger a collapse in installations. </p> <p>The episode has shone a spotlight on a clash between the administration's priorities for domestic industry and jobs versus a rapid buildout of green energy infrastructure. </p> <p>We'll have more on this topic on this on FT.com in the coming days. Stay tuned for Myles's interview with George Hershman, chief executive of SOLV Energy, the biggest large-scale solar installer in the US, who had some fiery pushback regarding the investigation.</p> <p>And Amanda's Data Drill looks ahead to next week when US oil bosses will be hauled into Congress to talk about petrol prices. Bad news for Biden: most Americans are blaming him, not the execs and their companies, for the price inflation.</p> <p>And another reminder that our Energy Source Live conference in Houston (and online) is coming up on April 7. That's next week! If you haven't already, <a href=\"https://energysource.live.ft.com/?reference=FTNewsletter&amp;utm_source=emh&amp;utm_medium=FTNewsletter&amp;utm_campaign=2022energysourcelive\">sign up and come join us</a>.</p> <p>Thanks for reading. </p> <p>Derek</p> <h1>Biden torn between climate and job priorities </h1> <p>Joe Biden has long insisted that his climate and jobs goals go hand in hand. “When I think climate change, I think jobs,” goes a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifp9UtoxA3Q\">common refrain</a> from the US president.&#xa0;</p> <p>But an investigation launched by the Department of Commerce this week laid bare a fundamental tension between two of the administration's key priorities. Protectionist trade policies might be good for domestic manufacturers and employment, but renewables developers are warning they could devastate their businesses and derail the greening of the American economy.</p> <p>Biden's dilemma is perfectly encapsulated in this week's clash. </p> <p>In response to a complaint by an American solar panel manufacturer, the Commerce Department on Tuesday launched a probe into whether Chinese competitors are dodging tariffs on parts exported to the US by completing them in south-east Asia.</p> <p>American solar developers, already under serious inflationary pressure, were up in arms, arguing that the investigation could lead to huge increases in costs and a collapse in solar installations this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Taking up this case will have a chilling effect on the solar industry,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, an industry group. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“This mis-step will have a devastating impact on the US solar market at a time when solar prices are climbing, and project delays and cancellations are adding up.”</p> </blockquote> <p>At the heart of the case are a series of so-called antidumping and countervailing duties imposed on several China-based solar parts makers a decade ago. Auxin Solar, the California-based manufacturer that filed the complaint, argues the companies are getting around the tariffs by completing products in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam before they are shipped to the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>The difference might seem somewhat academic. But analysts estimate that about three-quarters of US solar product imports come from these four countries. And the tariffs that could be extended to them range from 50-250 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>According to the American Clean Power Association, more than 80 per cent of utility-scale projects due to be installed this year are exposed to a tariff extension. SEIA has argued extending the tariffs could lead to 14 gigawatts of solar deployment being scrapped — more than half of all domestic solar capacity installed last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hopper said the move would crush many of the clean power jobs Biden has tried to put at the centre of his climate agenda.</p> <p>The stand-off is yet another headache for the Biden administration, which on one hand wants to drive a renewables construction boom, and on the other hand wants to spur a jobs and manufacturing boom and protect domestic industry.</p> <p>However, much as the administration tries to marry these aims, in reality they are at odds. Renewable developers are big businesses, focused on creating profits. They want to buy parts from the cheapest source, which tend to be Penang rather than Pittsburgh.</p> <p>The solar industry says it supports moving manufacturing on to American shores. But they say builders would need generous incentives —&#xa0;like the manufacturing tax credits included in the stalled Build Back Better bill —&#xa0;to set up US plants that can compete with Asia. Plus, developing a domestic solar manufacturing hub would take time. </p> <p>It is not just the solar industry that is fretting over this tension. Offshore wind developers also worry that if the administration forces them to buy local, it could tank the nascent industry.&#xa0;</p> <p>“If you put the hammer down today and basically say: ‘You can't build an offshore wind project unless you use a US-manufactured wind turbine', we're dead in the water,” Bill White, head of offshore wind at Avangrid, which is building the country's first commercial scale project, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdee7b49-9355-4d88-ab79-3340127b4a86\">told the FT</a> in September.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote>  <p>“We need to think carefully about potentially protectionist impulses that might inadvertently stop the progress on building offshore wind,” White said.</p> </blockquote> <p>But today it is solar that is feeling the heat — and the industry is increasing the pressure on the administration to put its climate goals first. </p> <p>Tom Kuhn, chief executive of the EEI, which represents investor-owned utilities, said that while the industry supports the development of a domestic manufacturing sector for renewable components, there needs to be “balance between clean energy progress and trade concerns”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Launching the solar investigation is only the starting point, but developers said they were already feeling the effect as suppliers worried about a retrospective hit from a negative ruling. When a final decision is made — expected early next year — analysts said there was a reasonable chance the Commerce department would rule in favour of Auxin.&#xa0;</p> <p>Analysts at Clearview Energy Partners said the department's “protectionist leanings” meant such an outcome was a distinct possibility. </p> <p>“If so, domestic solar deployment would face a new and substantial price increase to its supply,” they said. (<em>Myles McCormick and Justin Jacobs)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Executives at six big oil companies —&#xa0;Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, Pioneer, and Devon Energy —&#xa0;will testify before lawmakers at next week's House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing: “<a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-gouged-at-the-gas-station-big-oil-and-americas-pain-at-the\">Gouged at the Gas Station: Big Oil and America's Pain at the Pump”.</a></p> <p>While oil execs have agreed to attend Wednesday's hearing, EOG, Devon, and Occidental declined to attend a separate <a href=\"https://naturalresources.house.gov/media/press-releases/chair-grijalva-invites-fossil-fuel-executives-to-testify-on-increased-gas-prices-amid-industrys-record-profits-unused-drilling-permits\">hearing</a> held by the Natural Resources Committee on their unused drilling permits. The three companies are among the most significant oil and gas operators on public lands and waters, and hold more than 2,800 approved and unused drilling permits. </p> <p>“As rising gas prices started hurting Americans, fossil fuel industry trade groups and their allies in Congress wasted no time placing blame on the Biden administration and pushing for a drilling free-for-all,” said Raúl Grijalva, natural resources committee chair and Democrat from Arizona. “But when you look at oil companies' record profits, these claims don't add up.”</p> <p>Democrats are eager to move fast to mitigate the political damage of high pump prices ahead of November's midterm elections. A poll conducted by <a href=\"https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/national-poll-march-2022-us-voters-report-increased-hardship-as-prices-rise-blame-biden-for-gas-prices\">Emerson College Polling</a> found that nearly 40 per cent of American voters blame the Biden administration for high prices at the pump, more than twice the share of those who blame oil and gas companies. The poll also found that Americans were more likely to vote for the Republican congressional candidate on their ballot if the midterm election were held today.<em> (Amanda Chu) </em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Australian billionaire pledges enough <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d14e8e9-63a1-400b-81af-e705d6eaaba9\">green hydrogen to Germany</a> to help replace a third of its Russian imports.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Spain approves a “shock plan” to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/713ef01c-c858-4394-bacc-8284b8f841bb\">limit economic damage</a> from the war in Ukraine, including fuel cuts to defuse a transport strike.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Berkshire Hathaway ranks among <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ed603c4-ecbb-4181-a78b-f3b9f16703a8\">the worst climate actors</a> along with Saudi Aramco, according to a new Climate Action 100+ analysis.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Despite lofty climate pledges, global banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eeee0f7-bb02-4950-a6d6-49da39c3cc41\">haven't changed their fossil fuel financing</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Culture Wars: The same states restricting voting, abortion, and LGBTQ rights are also <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/03/republican-fossil-fuels-renewable-energy/629420/\">stalling the transition</a> from fossil fuels.
