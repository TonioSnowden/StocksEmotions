  "title": "Russia Sanctions Intensify Calls for Myanmar Fuel Ban—'If The Jets Can't Fly, They Can't Bomb'; Debate on what sanctions to impose on military junta is in spotlight amid harsh measures against Russia over Ukraine invasion",
  "text": "<p>In the past year since a military coup shook Myanmar, Washington and Brussels have taken steps to cut off the country's army leaders and their businesses from the global financial system. But the junta has continued its campaign of airstrikes, arrests and custodial torture to counter the armed resistance that has emerged in response to the coup. Now, the coup's opponents are pushing for a ban on the sale of jet fuel to Myanmar.</p><p>Such a move, they say, would hobble the air force that for months has hit rebel strongholds with bombs and mortar shells. According to a United Nations report released last month, the Myanmar military has used jet fighters, combat helicopters, bombs and rockets in dozens of airstrikes, killing scores of civilians including children as young as 5. Human-rights groups and local media have documented fighter planes dropping munitions on or near civilian structures including homes and camps for people displaced by the conflict.</p><p>\"Without fuel, the military can't use their air force,\" said Zin Mar Aung, foreign minister of the National Unity Government, which sees itself as a parallel administration composed of ousted civilian leaders and their allies. \"If the jets can't fly, they can't bomb. It is as simple as that.\"</p><p>The debate around sanctions—what measures to impose and how far to go—is in the spotlight amid the West's swift and severe actions against Russia. Sanctions against Myanmar have come slower and been far more limited, in part because Western countries have limited engagement with and leverage over Myanmar. Western policy makers' reluctance also stems from experience: Severe trade and travel bans imposed on Myanmar's earlier regimes crushed its economy and pushed it toward greater reliance on China and Russia.</p><p>But the coup's opponents say tougher steps are necessary to curb violence across the country. Conflict has intensified as anti-junta rebels have allied with ethnic insurgents that were already fighting the Myanmar military. The junta labeled the rebels as terrorists and has tried to uproot them by bombing and burning villages that it says sheltered the rebels.</p><p>The nonprofit Karen Peace Support Network has published detailed accounts of early attacks, including a dayslong bombardment last March of villages near the Thailand border that killed at least 16 people and destroyed large parts of a high school. Last month, the relief group Free Burma Rangers shared video footage of an airstrike on Nam Mae Kon village in southeast Myanmar. The group said at least two civilians were killed and three injured. The footage showed a building on fire as what sounded like gunfire and several explosions were heard nearby.</p><p>\"Any way that we can stop these planes from getting into the air, and from conducting these horrific raids on villages, needs to be looked at and needs to be seized,\" said Tom Andrews, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.</p><p>So far, no country has blocked jet-fuel sales to Myanmar. The U.K. government last month urged businesses to ensure supplies don't end up in the hands of the military, and dozens of British lawmakers have backed a motion calling for a ban. The U.N. report published last month also recommended that governments support a ban. Myanmar's Defense Ministry doesn't disclose its fuel sources, which is why some are seeking an all-out stoppage of aviation-fuel supplies.</p><p>The Myanmar military didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Industry analysts say a fuel ban is a blunt instrument that could ground army planes but would also bring civilian flights to a standstill. \"It would literally cripple any planes from flying,\" said Serena Huang, the head of Asia-Pacific analysis at the energy-data firm Vortexa.</p><p>The step isn't without precedent. The EU in 2014 banned jet-fuel exports to Syria. On the ground, Russian entities continued importing jet fuel to Syria in defiance of Western sanctions. The U.S. in 2019 blacklisted participants of what it said was an evasion scheme supplying jet fuel to Russian forces in Syria. Last year, a Danish supplier was found guilty of breaching EU sanctions by selling jet fuel to Russian companies that later shipped it to Syria.</p><p>With no domestic oil refineries, Myanmar is reliant on imports for all of its fuel. Data from Vortexa and energy analytics firm Kpler shows that 100% of Myanmar's jet fuel is shipped from ports in Singapore, India and Malaysia. Major Western energy companies have storage terminals in Singapore, and shipment records from before the coup show that companies linked to Western majors, including Shell PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., sold fuel to intermediaries, who then sold it in Myanmar.</p><p>Most of the jet fuel shipped to Myanmar from Singapore over the past three years was loaded from a terminal operated by Singapore Refining Co., a joint venture between Chevron and Singapore Petroleum Co., a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned company PetroChina, said Ms. Huang of Vortexa. As recently as late February, a shipment loaded at the Singapore terminal was delivered to Myanmar's Thilawa port, according to ship-monitoring site MarineTraffic.</p><p>A jet-fuel ban would require suppliers like Singapore Refining to ensure their product doesn't end up in Myanmar. Chevron said in a statement that the company doesn't comment on trade matters and complies with all applicable laws and sanctions. Singapore Refining didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Overall, most jet fuel delivered at Myanmar ports has historically been shipped by National Energy Puma Aviation Services Co. Ltd., which is majority-owned by state firm Myanma Petroleum Enterprise, according to the analytics firm Kpler. A person familiar with NEPAS's operations said its business is limited to the supply of aviation fuel to commercial and civilian customers.</p><p>The problem, said Zoya Phan, campaigns manager for London-based advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, is that standard fuel used to power commercial flights could also be used in military aircraft. \"The only way to stop these airstrikes is to try to stop the supply of aviation fuel,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Feliz Solomon at feliz.solomon@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Sanctions Intensify Calls for Myanmar Fuel Ban—'If The Jets Can't Fly, They Can't Bomb'</p>",
