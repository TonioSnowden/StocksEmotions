  "text": "<p>\"We're creating a system here, not just buying a business to plug in,\" Mr. Wirth said. \"It is building capabilities to do things that are very analogous to what we've historically done, with a wide variety of feedstocks.\"</p><p>In a sign of the importance of the Renewable Energy Group deal, Chevron said REG's president and chief executive, Cynthia J. Warner, is expected to join Chevron's board, and Chevron's renewable-fuels business will move its headquarters to Iowa.</p><p>The REG acquisition comes as Chevron, along with other big oil-and-gas companies, faces intense pressure to overhaul their businesses to reduce the fossil-fuel-generated carbon emissions that are a main contributor to global warming. Chevron said last year it will triple spending on its low-carbon unit, pledging to spend $10 billion through 2028 on biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies, up from a prior commitment of roughly $3 billion.</p><p>Part of Chevron's strategy is to boost production of renewable fuels: gas, diesel and oil typically made from organic or waste materials that generate less carbon dioxide over the course of their manufacturing and consumption than fossil fuels.</p><p>The company said last year that it hopes to produce 100,000 barrels of renewable diesel by 2030. That is a volume big enough to supply California-based Chevron's current diesel customers on the U.S. West Coast, which is implementing some of the country's most aggressive clean-fuel programs.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Group acquisition will help meet that goal because REG has a renewable-diesel facility that it is expanding to a capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, said Mark Nelson, Chevron's executive vice president in charge of its downstream and chemicals business, who is overseeing the renewable-fuels push.</p><p>Chevron is also pouring money into renewable gas, initially by tying up with companies that produce the fuel from dairy-cow manure.</p><p>Chevron last year announced a joint venture with U.S. agriculture giant Bunge Ltd. to develop more sources of renewable fuels, such as oils from soybean processing plants.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
