Think about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/49e2f1ee-c923-47f7-ac6d-7f8e1747305b\">puzzling array</a> of bets spearheaded by<strong> SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/107fe840-1874-4fb2-a70b-f2f8f1381215\">scrutiny</a> drawn by the company's highly competitive, instinct-driven investment culture.</p> <p>But<strong> Masayoshi Son</strong>'s eclectic portfolio looks mild compared to the collection of taxpayer stakes amassed by Sunak: from a trendy cinema chain and a kombucha-based drinks brewer to the car-selling site<strong> Motorway.co.uk</strong> and <strong>Snoop</strong>, the banking app founded by former <strong>Virgin Money</strong> boss <strong>Jayne-Anne Gadhia</strong>.</p> <p>The 158 companies that now count UK taxpayers as shareholders are just the ones disclosed by the government so far. Almost 1,200 businesses took out loans from the programme, likely leaving the chancellor with stakes in hundreds more companies.</p> <p>This isn't the first time UK taxpayer money has been invested in a struggling start-up.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an acquisition <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/oneweb-dominic-cummings-and-the-400m-public-bailout-to-rescue-an-imperilled-satellite-internet-firm-12252863\">orchestrated</a> by <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c463eff4-2370-459e-b49e-65739c5b5423\">former chief adviser</a> <strong>Dominic Cummings </strong>last year, the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1da90e8-8869-4740-b5eb-d8c6339d8e2f\">spent</a> about £500m of taxpayers' money to rescue the failed satellite operator <strong>OneWeb</strong> from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a joint investment with Indian telecoms tycoon <strong>Sunil Bharti Mittal</strong>.</p> <p>And the government's ambitions to grow its start-up scene have never been stronger, as investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5466b46d-9cb4-479f-bf5a-1bd15783eb22\">hunt for UK “unicorns”</a> with the potential to take on the trillion-dollar tech companies of China and Silicon Valley that have historically dwarfed British business.</p> <h2>Evergrande's default domino effect</h2> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb02efc1-6dab-468b-9691-296b8e35d4dd\">we told you</a> about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d127e05-2208-4226-9cd1-ef2f7463cdf0\">deepening liquidity crisis</a> at Chinese real estate giant <strong>Evergrande</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The situation took <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e099e0e3-4fba-45a4-92e2-08891c2f8b0e\">another turn for the worse</a> this week after retail investors descended upon the company's headquarters in Shenzhen.</p> <p>Footage circulating on social media showed investors, who had bought wealth management products related to Evergrande, demanding their money back.</p> <p>When it comes to the world's most indebted property developer, which has Rmb572bn ($89bn) in debts but close to Rmb2tn ($310bn) in liabilities, there's a long list of people with money at stake.&#xa0;</p> <p>A potential failure would hit not only its creditors, but the contractors that help build and sell its apartments and the customers who have already bought them. It has ongoing projects in hundreds of Chinese cities.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Evergrande said it expects worsening sales in September, and added that subsidiaries had failed to “discharge their guarantee obligations as scheduled” for third-party wealth management products worth Rmb934m. The company also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-warns-further-property-sales-drop-liquidity-crunch-2021-09-14/\">warned</a> of a “cross-default” if it fails to meet its financial obligations.</p> <p>“The company is in active discussion with the issuers and investors with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable repayment arrangement,” it said.</p> <p>Fears over a default have already rippled over to other developers in China, the fiasco exposing the perilous state of China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1144ffe-30f9-41d3-b033-bb82eca258b4\">vast property sector</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The property developer has also borrowed heavily on international markets where it owes about $14bn, meaning the repercussions could soon be felt beyond China's borders.</p> <h2>Are junior bankers being replaced by robots?</h2> <p>Entry-level analysts needn't fret over their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">six-figure salaries</a> just yet.</p> <p>As record <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b955a75-55a4-4e13-b785-638b88bbfb0b\">dealmaking activity</a> wreaked havoc on the work/life balances of Wall Street's lower ranks — the effect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">gruelling hours</a> on the mental health of a group of first-year <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>staff was captured in a now infamous PowerPoint — banks are starting to rethink things.</p> <p>Companies including Goldman, <strong>Barclays</strong> and <strong>Moelis</strong> are working on initiatives to automate&#xa0;basic functions such as generating pitch books and valuation modelling — aka “grunt work” — with the aim of reducing workloads and retaining talent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06b0a82d-b0fa-437f-b640-57bdaa508e59\">executives told</a> the FT's Joshua Franklin.</p> <p>The efforts hint that juicy pay raises across the industry haven't been enough to stem the industry's high turnover, and that, even in the middle of an M&amp;A windfall, understaffing still persists.</p> <p>Automating less glamorous tasks isn't a one-size-fits all solution, however. As Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d3248a6-25e6-4abf-bf9d-088c16b3316c\">points out</a>, the average managing director has a limited understanding of how said technology works, potentially burdening their subordinates with even more work.</p> <p>“Some [bankers] only spend time with junior bankers when they've made a mistake,” said<strong> David Stowell</strong>, a finance professor at <strong>Northwestern University</strong>'s <strong>Kellogg School of Management</strong> and a former investment banker. “Then these young people feel like they've been treated like machines.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c83b53a-4427-4415-877b-f534ea3b379a\">has appointed</a> <strong>Denis Coleman</strong>, currently co-head of its financing group, as its chief financial officer, succeeding <strong>Stephen Scherr</strong>, who will retire at the end of January.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has hired<strong> Lewis Burnett </strong>as head of UK corporate broking. He was previously co-head of corporate broking at <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Private equity firm<strong> One Rock Capital Partners</strong> has hired <strong>Allison Spector</strong> as head of ESG. She joins in New York from <strong>Nuveen</strong>, where she led sustainability initiatives for the firm's real assets and private markets groups.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Daniel Michael</strong>, who recently stepped down as chief of the complex financial instruments unit of the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>'s division of enforcement, is joining <strong>Skadden</strong> as a partner in the firm's New York office.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Jones Day</strong> has hired <strong>Dorothy Giobbe </strong>as of counsel in its financial markets practice, based in New York. She was previously an executive director and assistant general counsel at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Alexa, pass the scalpel </strong>A tie-up between Amazon and hospitals is just one way in which Big Tech is encroaching on the healthcare sector. And a public fed-up with America's convoluted medical system means there's never been a better time for Silicon Valley to strike.
