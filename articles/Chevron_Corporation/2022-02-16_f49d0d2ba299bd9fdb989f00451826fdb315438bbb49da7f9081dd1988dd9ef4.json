  "title": "A Tighter Oil Market Has Downsides for Producers, Too; Risk of conflict in Ukraine is pushing crude prices close to $100 a barrel, but it could drive investment needed to rebalance market",
  "text": "<p>\"Any disruption of oil flows from the region would send Brent and WTI prices skyrocketing higher, far above $100,\" says Nishant Bhushan, oil analyst at Rystad Energy, referring to the two dominant crude benchmarks. A supply interruption still seems an outside bet, given the world's dependence on Russian fuel and Moscow's reliance on selling it, but it is a clear risk.</p><p>Higher prices would fill the coffers of international producers, but there would be downsides too, particularly for those with Russian exposure. Britain's BP owns nearly one-fifth of Russian oil giant Rosneft. Last year, the stake contributed a proportional $2.7 billion in profits before interest and taxes—a little over one-tenth of BP's total—and about $600 million in dividends. Paris-listed TotalEnergies added €1.3 billion, equivalent to $1.5 billion, to its 2021 cash flow from Russian operations that include its stake in gas producer Novatek and the Yamal liquefied natural-gas plant.</p><p>However, any negative impact from the exposure will be tempered by oil price rises. RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria estimates that a $5 to $6 a barrel price increase would completely offset the loss of Russian dividends at BP and TotalEnergies in 2022. Shell and Exxon Mobil also have Russian projects, but the cash flow impact likely isn't significant for them.</p><p>Predicting the effect of conflict or sanctions is difficult. U.S. officials have talked of targeting Russia's finances, energy exports and the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline this time. Europeans, heavily reliant on Russian energy imports, are more cautious. Oil and gas continued to flow to Western Europe during prior Russian-Ukrainian conflicts despite sanctions. There were other impacts, though. For example, 2017 sanctions prompted Exxon Mobil to withdraw from research and exploration joint ventures with Rosneft.</p><p>Oil and gas markets have been stubbornly tight in recent months. Demand is recovering, but producers have struggled to increase production after their pandemic shutdowns. U.S. shale companies remain focused on capital discipline—a change from the growth-at-all-costs mind-set that kept a cap on global prices in the years before the pandemic.</p><p>If sustained, higher prices would encourage investment, eventually loosening the market. The search for new reserves remains muted among European companies, but Saudi and Russian producers are increasing their spending levels. The U.S. shale patch is getting busier, and Chevron and Exxon Mobil recently increased their local drilling ambitions. New U.S. shale wells are relatively quick to deliver volumes: Oil at $100 a barrel could prompt oil production in the Lower 48 states to hit its pre-pandemic peak of 10.4 million barrels a day as soon as the end of this year, according to Rystad Energy.</p><p>High oil and gas prices might also push some fuel users to seek alternatives. Martijn Rats of Morgan Stanley estimates that demand will start to be eroded if oil prices reach $100 a barrel.</p><p>Less than two years after some oil prices went negative, the risk of conflict in Ukraine has added to talk of a new supercycle. It might not be long before the picture changes again. The inelasticity of oil and gas markets means the distance between feast and famine can be surprisingly small.</p><p>Write to Rochelle Toplensky at rochelle.toplensky@wsj.com</p><p>A Tighter Oil Market Has Downsides for Producers, Too</p>",
