  "text": "<p>The piece by Laurence Fletcher and Joshua Oliver (“Green funds risk a red flag”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae78c05a-0481-4774-8f9b-d3f02e4f2c6f\">Big Read</a>, February 21), lays bare one of the major obstacles to progress on the environment: the lack of precise meanings of “green” and “sustainable”. </p> <p>Thirty-five years ago Gro Harlem Brundtland defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present “without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs”. </p> <p>Yet notwithstanding countless quantitative assessments and studies on the subject, the crucial terms “needs”, “compromise” and “ability” remain vague. Consequently, while many might, for example, be quite certain that activities undertaken by companies like Chevron and Shell are “unsustainable”, the claim is virtually impossible to prove.</p> <p>Do the authors detect any irony in their stating that on the one hand sustainable and green are “seemingly vague” terms and, on the other, that investors poured exactly $142.5bn into sustainable funds in the fourth quarter of last year? </p> <p>Even the Cambridge dictionary appears to be of no help here since it defines “sustainable” as causing “little or no” damage to the environment for “a long time”. What precisely do these phrases mean?</p> <p>Basic accounting and finance inform us that sustainable activity is that which preserves wealth or assets. </p> <p>Or, as the economist Sir John Hicks remarked, all income — presuming, of course, it is positive — is sustainable by definition. </p> <p>Conceptually, it really is that simple. Unfortunately, since the environmental and social costs of “unsustainable” economic activity have always been murky, and often unquantifiable, opportunities for deception or obfuscation (referred to as “greenwashing” by the authors) remain rife.</p> <p>Market failures come in many forms, but it is difficult to imagine a more consequential example. </p> <p><strong>Mariano Torras <br></strong><em>Professor of Economics <br>Chair, Department of Finance and Economics, Adelphi University<br>Garden City, NY, US</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Defining sustainability is a challenge for investors' FT.com 25 February.
