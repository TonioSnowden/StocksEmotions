  "text": "<p>\"We do have a major storm heading our way,\" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. \"We are activating every single resource at our disposal so we are prepared to respond.\"</p><p>Current forecasts show the storm potentially becoming as strong as a Category 3 hurricane over the next two days, with winds reaching as high as 120 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for New Orleans, Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast from Cameron, La., through Mississippi to the border of Alabama.</p><p>A hurricane warning was also in effect for the western Cuba provinces of Pinar del Rio and Artemisa, and the Isle of Youth, where the hurricane began to hit Friday afternoon with sustained winds of 75 mph.</p><p>If the storm makes landfall in Louisiana Sunday, it will arrive exactly 16 years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. \"We know that Aug. 29 is a very critical date in our city's history and in all of our collective memories,\" said Collin Arnold, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. \"But that date has also taught us to be ready to be resilient, and that's what we're going to do together.\"</p><p>Since Katrina, a $14.5 billion flood protection system—flood walls, levees, canals and barriers constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—has helped bolster storm defenses around New Orleans.</p><p>Officials with the Flood Protection Authority East said they closed 24 land-based gates across the flood-protection system Thursday in anticipation of the storm, and plan to close another 27 gates Friday. The remaining 50 will be closed by Saturday, said Kelli Chandler, regional director of the Flood Protection Authority-East.</p><p>\"We are confident it will perform as designed,\" Ms. Chandler said.</p><p>Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for residents living outside of the levee system in Irish Bayou, Venetian Isles and Lake Catherine. New Orleans officials also called for voluntary evacuation across Orleans Parish. The National Hurricane Center said storm surge may possibly top levees outside of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System.</p><p>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Thursday night, activating emergency personnel. He warned residents across the state to plan for flash flooding, heavy rains and power outages.</p><p>\"The people of Louisiana have been tested time and time again,\" the Democrat said, \"and while it is my hope and prayer that this storm will not bring destruction to our state, we should be prepared to take the brunt of the severe weather.\"</p><p>Forecasters warned Ida could bring storm surges as high as 11 feet above ground along parts of the Louisiana coast, and eight to 16 inches of rain, reaching as much as 20 inches of rain in some areas of southeast Louisiana and the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama. Heavy winds could also produce devastating wind damage, forecasters warned, depending on where the storm makes landfall.</p><p>Joel Cline, tropical program coordinator for the National Weather Service, said the high levels of storm surge coupled with a foot or more of rain could create a dangerous situation.</p><p>\"There's a lot of water and very few places for it to go,\" he said. \"Clearly, people need to prepare.\"</p><p>Ida's projected path also made it a threat to the vast oil refining and petrochemical complex situated along the U.S. Gulf Coast, though the storm's more easterly track Friday suggested it would miss the heart of those operations in Texas and along the Texas-Louisiana border.</p><p>The storm was also affecting offshore production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, which account for roughly 17% of the nation's oil production and around 5% of its natural gas output.</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Chevron Corp. said they had begun evacuating staff from offshore platforms, with Shell and BP starting to shut in production at eight major oil-production sites. Chevron said output at its platforms was still at normal levels, but it was evacuating nonessential personnel.</p><p>Oil refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp., which has a refinery near Lake Charles, La., and pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. said they were monitoring the storm's path. Enbridge said it was evacuating staff from its offshore operations.</p><p>The center of the storm Friday afternoon was about 165 miles east of the western tip of Cuba, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. A tropical-storm warning was in effect for parts of Cuba. National Hurricane Center forecasters warned of heavy rains, flash flooding and mudslides in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, western Cuba and the Isle of Youth.</p><p>The National Hurricane Center said the storm would shift away from the Cayman Islands and pass western Cuba Friday before making its way to the Gulf of Mexico by the evening or Saturday.</p><p>Tropical Storm Ida is the ninth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration anticipated an above-average season, with between 15 and 21 named storms, and three to five of those becoming major hurricanes.</p><p>The 2020 hurricane season was the busiest on record with 30 named storms. On Aug. 27 last year, Hurricane Laura became the strongest storm to make landfall in Louisiana in more than a century. The Category 4 storm resulted in widespread power outages, flooding, intense storm surge and led to dozens of fatalities.</p><p>—Collin Eaton contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Hurricane Ida Strengthens as It Heads Toward Louisiana</p>",
