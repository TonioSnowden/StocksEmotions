  "text": "<p>That leads to a new prediction for 2023 and a related stock screen below.</p><p>Here's a chart showing the movement of front-month contract prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil CL.1 since the end of 2021:</p><p>Even though Kupperman didn't get his oil price call right, the energy sector of the S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 60% for 2022 through Dec. 27, excluding dividends. That is the only one of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors to show a gain in 2022. And the energy sector is also cheapest relative to earnings expectations, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.8, compared with 16.7 for the full S&amp;P 500.</p><p>WTI pulled back from its momentary peak at $130.50 in early March, but that didn't reverse the long-term trend of low capital spending by oil and natural gas producers, which has given investors confidence that supplies will remain tight.</p><p>Vicki Hollub, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY — the best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock of 2022 — said during a recent interview that there was \"no pressure to increase production right now,\" citing a $40 per barrel break-even point for oil prices.</p><p>Kupperman now expects strong demand and low supplies to push oil as high as $200 a barrel in 2023.</p><p>At the end of November, these 20 oil companies stood out as reasonable plays for 2023 based on expectations for free-cash-flow generation and dividend payments.</p><p>For this next screen, we are only looking at ratings and consensus price targets among analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>There are 23 energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500, and you can invest in that group easily by purchasing shares of the Energy Select SPDR ETF XLE.
