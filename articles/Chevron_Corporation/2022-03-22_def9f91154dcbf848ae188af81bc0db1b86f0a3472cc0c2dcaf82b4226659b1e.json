  "title": "Contract Impasse Leads to Strike  At Chevron Refinery in California  ----  By Allison Prang",
  "text": "<p>   More than 500 Chevron Corp. employees went on strike at a refinery in California on Monday amid a contract stalemate. </p><p>   The strike comes after the company's contract with the United Steelworkers Local 5 union expired Feb. 1, according to the United Steelworkers. </p><p>   Union members at the Bay Area plant had been working on a rolling extension ahead of the strike. </p><p>   \"USW members continued to report for work throughout the pandemic so our nation could meet its energy needs,\" said Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers' National Oil Bargaining Program. \"They deserve a fair contract that reflects their sacrifice.\" </p><p>   The Richmond refinery has about 3,000 total employees, according to Chevron. </p><p>   The company said the contract it is offering workers is competitive, fair and responsive to the union's concerns. </p><p>   \"We have negotiated in good faith for months, reaching two tentative agreements that were rejected by the union, and we are ready to continue discussions with USW so we can reach an equitable agreement,\" Chevron said in a statement. </p><p>   The strike comes amid surging gasoline prices across the U.S. </p><p>   In California, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline is at $5.855 a gallon, the highest in the country, according to AAA. </p><p>   Chevron said it is prepared to continue its normal operations and doesn't expect supply-chain problems. It wouldn't say whether gas prices would be affected. </p><p>   The broader United Steelworkers reached a pattern agreement with the oil industry about a month ago, but the individual units bargain over local issues as well, according to the union. </p><p>   Chevron said United Steelworkers Local 5's demands were more than what the company considers reasonable and went beyond the national pattern bargaining agreement. </p><p>   The Chevron strike is the latest in a string of high-profile strikes that have swept the country over the past several months. </p><p>   Workers at Deere &amp; Co., Mondelez International Inc. and Kellogg Co. ended up accepting new contracts that included pay raises, among other provisions. </p><p></p>",
