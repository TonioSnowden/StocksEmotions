  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX advanced 33 points, or 0.9%, to 3,967.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 257 points, or 0.8%, to 33,855.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 127 points, or 1.2%, to 11,086.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 declined 7 points, or 0.19%, to 3934, on Wednesday, cementing a five-day losing streak — its longest since Oct. 12.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Investors cheered weekly data Thursday showing the number of continuing jobless-benefit claims rose to the highest level since February, which was interpreted as reducing some of the pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue to raise interest rates, said Richard Farr, chief market strategist at Merion Capital Group.</p><p>\"The small increase in unemployment claims may be viewed by some as a reason to reduce recession odds,\" Farr said.</p><p>Markets have been pricing in a greater chance of a sharp economic downturn next year since the start of the month, as Treasury yields, oil prices and stocks have fallen, Farr said.</p><p>See: U.S. jobless claims climb to 230,000 in sign labor market may be slowly cooling off</p><p>Treasury yields climbed Thursday though with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rising 6 basis points to 3.474%, although yields were still lower than they were at the start of the month.</p><p>Recent moves in markets suggested that \"recession risks have started to overshadow inflation in the eyes of investors,\" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM.</p><p>Crude-oil futures CL.1 were trading at $72.37 per barrel, having dropped more than 40% from its March highs.</p><p>Investors have been focused on the U.S. labor market lately. Last week, data showing hotter-than-expected acceleration in wage growth, along with a more robust labor market, sent stocks sharply lower as investors surmised that the Fed's efforts to counter inflation weren't having their intended effect.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that unemployment will likely need to rise in order for the Fed to succeed in suppressing the worst inflationary wave in four decades.</p><p>The takeaway from Thursday's weekly jobless claims data is that it's taking unemployed Americans slightly longer to find work, according to Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, in a note.</p><p>\"At face value, the rise in continuing claims relative to the flat movement in initial claims implies that it is taking somewhat longer for those recently unemployment to find new jobs — the opposite of what we saw earlier this year,\" Dutta said.</p><p>Single-stock movers</p><p>* Tesla Inc. TSLA shares traded lower yet again on Thursday, adding to a recent string of losses for the electric-vehicle maker. The company has denied reports about planned production cuts at its Shanghai factory.</p><p>* Shares of oil and gas giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Chevron Corp. CVX were rebounding as oil prices bounced after a sharp decline.</p><p>* GameStop Corp. GMEshares shot higher despite a disappointing quarterly earnings report.</p><p>U.S. stocks rally after 5-day losing streak as data suggests economic growth slowing ahead of next week's Fed meeting</p>",
