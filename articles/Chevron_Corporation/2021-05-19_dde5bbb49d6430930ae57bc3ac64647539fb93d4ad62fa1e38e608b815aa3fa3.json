  "text": "<p>Good morning from New York. For the past year or so “natural capital” and “biodiversity” have been two of the hottest buzzwords in environmental, social and governance investing. But for all the talk, how much are companies and investors actually doing? Camilla Hodgson, from the FT's Climate Capital team, and I set out to answer that question in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/599675df-25f5-4846-860c-195faf91059e\">our latest article</a>. And read on to see how these issues are coming up at companies' annual meetings. <em>— Billy Nauman</em></p> <h1>IEA sets off shockwaves by stating the obvious</h1> <p>For anyone paying attention to what <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11859a52-f5ea-11e5-96db-fc683b5e52db\">scientists have been saying</a> about climate change, the contents of Tuesday's <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\">report</a> from the International Energy Agency (IEA), will come as little surprise.</p> <p>However, the fact that this message is now coming from the IEA is setting off shockwaves, given its history of backing fossil fuel expansion.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors that have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d56db46-6241-4b1c-846f-9985933cbdd0\">divested from fossil fuel companies</a> see this change of heart as a vindication of their strategy.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Anders Schelde</strong>, chief investment officer of AkademikerPension, the $22bn Danish pension fund, said the report showed the fund's decision to drop its equity shares of fossil fuel companies (including oil majors like Shell, Exxon, BP, and Total) was a “prudent [decision] that more investors should follow”.</p> <p><strong>Yossi Cadan</strong>, global finance campaign manager at environmental group 350.org, said it had taken away investors' “cover to justify continued fossil fuel expansion” and escalated pressure on the finance sector to stop funding high carbon companies.</p> <p>Yet, the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b524b96-7311-4fd7-9b2e-ff989dfb2b84\">sobering reality</a>”, is that there are few concrete government policies in place today that will curtail fossil fuel expansion. </p> <p>At the same time the IEA report came out, Brent crude <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83b10e14-d143-4951-a315-cd4170320ac3\">hit its highest price</a> in two months; fossil fuel company shares stayed mostly flat; and shareholders approved a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77c02f1-15ce-4d74-86d0-91d822b426c1\">climate plan</a> at Shell that will see the company continue looking for new fossil fuel reserves until 2025.</p> <p>The lack of market reaction is “interesting” said <strong>David Czupryna</strong>, head of ESG development at investment manager Candriam. </p> <p>“Is it sheer complacency? The IEA is not some kind of peripheral institution that oil market participants can afford to ignore,” he added. “It is the closest you get to an energy market watchdog. And this report sounds very much like the dog is awakening and sounding the alarm.”</p> <p>So perhaps a better way to interpret this is that what the IEA's report really shows is that more drastic action is needed from world leaders to cut fossil fuels and invest in clean energy if there is any chance of achieving the Paris goals.</p> <p>And that's not just coming from Moral Money, that's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b524b96-7311-4fd7-9b2e-ff989dfb2b84\">straight from the FT editorial board itself.</a> <em>(Billy Nauman)</em></p> <h1>Has the ‘Attenborough effect' come for asset managers?</h1> <p>The images of albatrosses eating plastics in <strong>David Attenborough</strong>'s 2018 BBC documentary shocked viewers into action. Suddenly, people scrutinised their purchases for plastic. The “Attenborough effect” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e091c436-3d16-11e8-b9f9-de94fa33a81e\">even restarted glass milk bottle purchases</a>.</p> <p>Now, the world's largest asset managers appear to be spellbound by the 95-year-old naturalist, too.</p> <p>In previous years, plastics maker DuPont easily shrugged off environmentalists' concerns about the company's production of tiny, nurdle pellets, which are used as the raw material for most plastics. In 2019, just 7 per cent of shareholders supported a proposal demanding disclosures about plastic pellet harm to the environment.</p> <p>But this year, DuPont investors delivered a jolt. The same proposal won a whopping 81 per cent support —&#xa0;a record high for an environmental petition that was opposed by the company.</p> <p>The backlash at DuPont has been part of a bigger trend this year at companies' annual meetings. Environmental, social and governance shareholder proposals that received paltry support in previous years are now drawing significant backing.</p> <p>At Pfizer, shareholder support doubled this year for a proposal requesting disclosures about political spending. And a majority of Berkshire Hathaway investors (other than <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>) threw support behind a proposal calling for diversity and inclusion disclosures.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The reason for the volte-face is simple. The big three asset managers, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, are now supporting ESG proposals they once opposed, Morningstar <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1039244/hints-of-sea-change-in-big-fund-company-esg-proxy-votes\">said in a new report</a> about the shareholder voting season so far this year.</p> <p>Voting has increasingly become a client concern for asset managers, said <strong>Jackie Cook</strong>, director of investment stewardship research at Morningstar. In Europe, “public pension funds are starting to ask asset managers about their stewardship”, she said.</p> <p>More companies will be under pressure in the days ahead. Amazon, Chevron, Exxon and Facebook have their annual meetings on May 26. And all four face a range of environmental and social shareholder proposals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Will the Attenborough effect continue to reverberate?&#xa0;(<em>Patrick Temple-West</em>)</p> <h1>GOP economist embraces ESG</h1> <p>If you want another sign of change, check out an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b30f6ea-1443-40fc-ad59-10da6d1f1b1e\">interview</a> that we recently did with <strong>Glenn Hubbard</strong> (pictured). Until the Trump era, Hubbard, the former dean of Columbia Business School, used to epitomise Republican economic policy. He advised president George W Bush and was a highly respected champion of the type of free-market ideas espoused by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Then came Trump, who offered a confusing blend of protectionism, deregulation and low taxes that often left traditionalists such as Hubbard dismayed.</p> <p>Now, however, Hubbard is trying to present a new free-market, pro-business economic vision, based around the competitive ideals of Adam Smith. But this no longer implies blind faith in the type of shareholder-first mantra that ruled in Reagan's world; Hubbard says he supports stakeholder ideals. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“I don't see ESG as somehow an enemy of shareholders — this isn't Milton Friedman versus socialism — it's more a matter of what really is in the long-term interest of the firm,” he observed. “Businesspeople today need to understand the corporate structure is a social gift. In fact, capitalism is a social gift. If the public doesn't want it, it won't happen.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Hubbard also says that he supports a carbon tax. “I'm very sceptical of subsidies in green things but if you put a price on carbon, businesspeople will rush around and innovate and do it efficiently and it does not have to be regressive. I don't understand why the administration that calls itself both progressive and green is walking away from the one instrument that might be able to help with both!”&#xa0;</p> <p>Will this world view have any impact on Trumpians? Probably not. But ESG activists should take note: mainstream Republican thought may now be evolving in some surprising ways. <em>(Gillian Tett)</em></p> <h1>CFA pushes forward with new ESG standards</h1> <p>A few months back <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1047a7ba-6160-449b-ba65-eab6be5e9f8c\">we told you</a> about the CFA Institute's plan to introduce a new set of ESG standards for asset managers.</p> <p>At the time, it did not receive the warmest welcome. The Investment Company Institute (ICI), the largest industry body representing US fund managers, raised concerns about whether it was necessary, given all the other standards on the market.</p> <p>But later today the CFA will publish a draft version of its framework.</p> <p>While it recognises the fact no one is calling for more letters in the ESG alphabet soup, the CFA sees its imitative as filling an important gap.</p> <p>The different thing about the CFA's plan is that it creates guidelines for investment products so that investors know what they are buying, while GRI, SASB and the like are focused on company-level disclosures.</p> <p>There would be some overlap with the EU's sustainable finance disclosure regime (SFDR) regulation, but managers that are required to comply with those rules would be able to port a lot of the same information into the CFA's system, said <strong>Chris Fidler</strong>, head of the CFA's ESG initiative.</p> <p>And Fidler thinks the CFA's framework is more likely than SFDR to be adopted worldwide.</p> <p>The CFA framework has the advantage of being designed to be global in scope. It was also not created with an expressed goal of driving more capital into ESG funds. That agnosticism should make it more palatable for investors in jurisdictions, like the US, where regulators' views on ESG have been murky, Fidler said. </p> <p>The final version of the standards is set to be published in November. And Fidler believes even the ICI will be more receptive, this time around. </p> <p>“I think they're more understanding of where we're coming from and where we're focused and why we're why we're doing this.” <em>(Billy Nauman)</em></p> <h1>Tips from Tamami</h1> <p><em>Nikkei's Tamami Shimizuishi helps you stay up to date on stories you may have missed from the eastern hemisphere.</em></p> <p>While proxy advisers have been busy pushing companies for more information on everything from climate policy to executive pay, regulators are weighing how to improve the transparency of proxy advisers themselves. </p> <p>The task is so tricky that the top US financial regulator was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a669f633-d9ba-48b1-bf96-b55b369901a8\">sued by the world's largest proxy adviser</a>, Institutional Shareholder Services. But a smaller regulator in Asia has shown another way forward, without triggering a legal challenge. &#xa0;</p> <p>Taiwan Depository &amp; Clearing Corporation (TDCC), a central securities depository, announced today its strategic partnership with Glass Lewis, which will provide the second-largest adviser's proxy research reports to companies listed in Taiwan for free.</p> <p>Taiwan is the first market in the world “where the central securities depository helps ensure that companies have timely access” to proxy research papers, TDCC chair Sherman Lin said.</p> <p>TDCC believes that making proxy reports available will improve corporations' ESG actions, TDCC said.</p> <p>TDCC has also provided access to major ESG ratings and reports since last year, encouraging issuers in Taiwan.</p> <p>“We are seeing a sustained increase in demand for meaningful and actionable governance research across the Asia Pacific region,” <strong>Stanley Soosur</strong>, country head Australia at Glass Lewis, said. Soosur said that the partnership with TDCC was unique as it provided “whole market coverage”, but Glass Lewis would continue to develop new relationships “where we find suitable partners”. </p> <h1>Charts of the day</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Can sustainability measurement and reporting standards serve not only companies and investors, but also the planet?
