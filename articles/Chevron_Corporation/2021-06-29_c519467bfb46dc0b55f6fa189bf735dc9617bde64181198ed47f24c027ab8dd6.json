  "text": "<p>Declan Kelly, an influential adviser to many Fortune 500 chief executives, has resigned as head of the communication firm Teneo, days after allegations of drunken misconduct at a charity concert. </p> <p>Kelly's departure marks a swift fall for an Irish-born executive who built a public relations empire by convincing corporate leaders that Teneo, which he styled as “the world's pre-eminent CEO advisory firm”, could save them from reputational crises. </p> <p>His exit comes five days after the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">revealed </a>that Kelly had inappropriately touched a number of women without their consent at Global Citizen's Vax Live concert in California on May 2. </p> <p>A day after the FT revelations, General Motors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37f8b75-f29f-4f6f-83d3-b9e559a2c79e\">cancelled a new $250,000</a>-per-month contract with Teneo, heightening fears inside the firm about a possible client exodus. </p> <p>Global Citizen, the anti-poverty campaign group that had worked with Kelly for years, told the FT last week that it had immediately removed him from its board on May 3 when it received complaints about his behaviour. It has launched an investigation into his conduct at the event. </p> <p>The crisis throws into question the future of Teneo, which Kelly co-founded in 2011 with Doug Band, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, whose network both men relied on to build the business.</p> <p>Band <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/149647b0-fbe6-4019-9478-fc553ed4ce6c\">resigned in December</a> after an interview that detailed his breakdown of relations with the former US president.</p> <p>The negative attention has also put pressure on private equity group CVC Capital Partners, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ef2e618-8944-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2\">which paid $350m</a> for a majority stake in Teneo in 2019 that valued the firm at about $700m. CVC has not commented on the allegations against Kelly or its plans for the company. </p> <p>Teneo has been a disruptive force in the business of providing high-level communications advice, in part by tapping a roster of blue-chip former CEOs and retired politicians as senior advisers, including former Xerox boss Ursula Burns, ex-Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan and former UK foreign secretary William Hague. </p> <p>The firm has grown rapidly through acquisitions, employs 1,250 people and counts Chevron, Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, General Electric, NatWest, Tesco and UBS among its clients. </p> <p>Teneo said on Tuesday that Kelly would be replaced by the firm's other co-founder, chief operating officer Paul Keary, “effective immediately”.</p> <p>In a statement, Kelly said that he had made “an inadvertent, public and embarrassing mistake for which I took full responsibility and apologised to those directly affected, as well as my colleagues and clients”.</p> <p>He added: “A campaign against the reputation of our firm has followed and may even continue in the coming days. However, regardless of the veracity of any such matters I do not want them to be an ongoing distraction to the running of our company.”</p> <p>His exit means that Teneo has lost its most effective recruiter of new clients. As Teneo grew rapidly over the past decade, Kelly managed directly a minority of its accounts but he remained a close and valued adviser to scores of top chief executives. </p> <p>Teneo has recently completed its acquisition of Deloitte's UK restructuring services business. According to a Moody's report from March, the deal cost $279m and was funded in part by another $100m investment from CVC. The deal would leave Teneo's debt above six times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, the credit rating agency said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Kelly told the FT last week that the executive had become inebriated and behaved inappropriately towards both women and men at the Global Citizen event. </p> <p>He had “temporarily reduced his work responsibilities”, was “committed to sobriety” and was “undertaking ongoing counselling from healthcare professionals”, the spokesperson said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by</em> <em>Oliver Ralph and Stephen Morris</em> </p><p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York and Arash Massoudi in London 2021 'Declan Kelly resigns as Teneo chief after claims of drunken misconduct' FT.com 29 June.
