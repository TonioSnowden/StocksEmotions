  "text": "<p>BP announced further share buybacks after third-quarter earnings more than doubled to $8bn, leaving the energy group on course for one of the most profitable years in its history.</p> <p>Underlying profits for the three-month period were $8.2bn, up from $3.3bn a year earlier and far exceeding analysts' average estimates of $6.1bn.</p> <p>The group's results cap a historic series of earnings for the world's biggest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/companies/oil-gas\">oil and gas</a> companies, buoyed by continued high energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.</p> <p>ExxonMobil reported a record quarterly profit of nearly $20bn last week, while Shell and Chevron posted the second-highest earnings in their histories at $9.5bn and $11.2bn respectively.</p> <p>The oil and gas sector's sustained profits since the invasion have fuelled renewed calls in countries including the US and UK for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f57f405-94c8-44cb-8fae-5f9e6390bf72\">more aggressive taxation</a> of the industry. BP shares have risen more than 45 per cent this year.</p> <p>“It's time for these companies to stop war profiteering,” US president Joe Biden said on Monday as he threatened to impose a windfall tax on US profits unless oil and gas producers boosted production in the US to help bring down prices.</p> <p>In the UK, which introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in May, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/ccd05942-e442-4e21-906d-4e25d932e4cc\">BP</a> said it expected to pay about $2.5bn in taxes on production from its North Sea business in 2022, including about $800mn under the government's new energy profits levy.</p> <p>Chief financial officer Murray Auchincloss told the Financial Times that “$2 out of every $3 we make [in the North Sea] is going to the government”, noting that it was a “very difficult time for society”. </p> <p>The tax contribution far exceeds that of rival Shell, which last week said new investments and decommissioning costs in the North Sea meant it had paid no UK taxes this year despite global profits of more than $30bn in the first nine months of 2022.</p> <p>Ben van Beurden, Shell chief executive, last week said the sector should be ready to “embrace” higher taxes. Rishi Sunak, the UK's new prime minister, is weighing options to expand the levy.</p> <p>In the US, BP has sought to boost oil and gas production by bringing two more rigs into the Gulf of Mexico, and two to three more rigs to onshore US fields, Auchincloss said. Investments in the North Sea will increase its UK production by 20-30 per cent by the middle of the decade, he added.</p> <p>Though slightly down from its 14-year high profit of $8.5bn in the second quarter, BP's third-quarter earnings were once again the strongest since 2008 and net debt declined for the 10th consecutive quarter.</p> <p>The performance was helped by what BP described as “exceptional” profits from its gas trading and marketing business. Underlying earnings in the gas and low-carbon energy division were $6.2bn, up from $3bn in the second quarter.</p> <p>Auchincloss said BP had sent 125 cargoes of liquefied natural gas to Europe in the past 12 months, 60 per cent more than in a “normal” year, as governments sought to replace Russian flows and stock the region's gas infrastructure ahead of this winter. “It's all about just trying to get energy to flow to the market that needs it the most right now,” he said.</p> <p>Profits from BP's oil business were slightly weaker than the previous quarter because of lower refining margins and “average” oil trading results, but still reached $5.2bn, the company said.</p> <p>If the $4.1bn acquisition of US-listed biogas producer Archaea — BP's biggest ever low-carbon deal — completes before the end of the year, the company expects capital expenditure in 2022 to reach $15.5bn.</p> <p>BP may make other, smaller green energy acquisitions this year to help “accelerate” the company's transition, Auchincloss said, but total expenditure would not exceed the $14bn-$16bn BP has projected.</p> <p>The company committed to buy back a further $2.5bn in shares in the fourth quarter, which would bring total share purchases for the year to just over $10bn. It left its dividend unchanged after raising it by 10 per cent in July. </p><p>Source: Tom Wilson in London 2022 'BP to buy back more shares after profit doubles to $8bn' FT.com 1 November.
