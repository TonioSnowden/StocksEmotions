  "title": "As Gasoline Prices Surge Nationwide, $5 Is a Bargain Around San Francisco; The Bay Area has the highest prices of any metro region in the nation, prompting long lines at one station where regular unleaded was $4.99",
  "text": "<p>ORINDA, Calif.—Jakob Deshler said he felt fortunate when he had to fill up his tank Tuesday in this suburb east of San Francisco: Mash Gas &amp; Food was selling gasoline for $4.99 a gallon.</p><p>\"It's nice, feels like I'm getting over on the big gas companies,\" the 31-year-old telephone lineman, who commutes 120 miles round-trip every day, said after filling up his Toyota Tacoma.</p><p>The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the U.S. on Wednesday was $4.25, a record high that is up 78 cents from a month ago and $1.46 from a year ago, according to AAA. Prices began to rise early in the winter as demand grew faster than supply with the easing of the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove prices higher, and the Biden administration's decision to ban imports of Russian crude oil drove them up again.</p><p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, the average price Wednesday was $5.75, the highest of any metro area in the country, according to online tracker GasBuddy. </p><p>Drivers lined up for $4.99 gasoline at Mash Gas &amp; Food in Orinda, Calif., which aims to be the cheapest alternative in the nation's costliest market. PHOTO: Jim Carlton/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>In more-remote regions of California it is even higher. A station in the affluent tourist town of Mendocino is charging more than $8. California's prices are the country's highest due in part to requirements for a specific blend of fuel meant to combat air pollution and a nation-high tax of 51 cents a gallon, according to industry analysts.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What steps should be taken to mitigate rising gasoline prices? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Around the San Francisco area, where everything from housing to groceries is more expensive than in most cities, Mash's price of $4.99 for a gallon of regular unleaded—if paid for in cash—is a bargain. On Tuesday afternoon, the line of waiting cars and trucks was about 10 vehicles long. An attendant kept them from blocking a neighboring restaurant parking lot and nearby highway offramp.</p><p>Patron Masood Ahmadi said he goes out of his way to refuel at Mash: If he needs gasoline when he leaves home in Brentwood, about 40 miles away, he sometimes buys just $10 worth so he can finish filling up in Orinda, where he works as a soccer coach.</p><p>Co-owner Ali Mashhoon said the station, which isn't affiliated with a national chain, has long tried to stand out with lower prices and to make up for narrow margins with high volume. </p><p>Mash's co-owner, Ali Mashhoon, and manager, Mehdi Boostanpour.

Over the past month, as customers have become more sensitive to discounts on the skyrocketing average price, he said daily sales have risen to about 14,000 gallons from 12,000.</p><p>Mr. Mashhoon said he and his family opened the station in 2019, when its price of gasoline was about $2 a gallon. Following the advice of his Iranian-immigrant father, who operated service stations during the fuel shortages of the 1970s, they installed two tanks capable of holding up to 35,000 gallons of fuel combined. That allows Mash to wait longer than some competitors before it has to refill, he said—which at a time of rising prices means longer before it has to pass on an increase in the wholesale cost.</p><p>The station also sells soda, chips and other snacks, but manager Mehdi Boostanpour said wholesale prices of those items have risen 10% to 15% over the past month, squeezing profits on them.</p><p>Independently owned and operated gas stations generally have lower prices than major chains because they spend less on expenses like marketing, said Patrick De Haan, head petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.</p><p>Mash's advertising consists primarily of one weekly ad in the Orinda News newspaper. </p><p>At a Chevron station down the road, the price that same day was 90 cents higher. PHOTO: Jim Carlton/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>At a Chevron station half a mile away, regular unleaded was $5.89 Tuesday—90 cents more than at Mash. Professional golfer Joel Morgan said he didn't go to Mash because the Chevron was close to a more convenient highway ramp and his supermarket discount card shaved the price by 20 cents.</p><p>Still, he stopped the pump at $11.89—two gallons, just a little more than his Subaru needed for the 40-mile drive home.</p><p>At Mash, Tania Yaser couldn't bring herself to be grateful for $5 gasoline she was putting in her BMW X3. The medical-device consultant's weekly gasoline expense has grown to $200 from $120 in the past month.</p><p>\"It's burning a hole in my pocket,\" she said.</p><p>Standing outside the station Tuesday with cars lined up five deep, Mr. Mashoon said he didn't expect the $4.99 to last. \"Part of this job is seeing how long we can hold on,\" he said.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mash raised its price for regular unleaded to $5.29—still among the lowest in the area.</p><p>Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com</p><p>As Gasoline Prices Surge Nationwide, $5 Is a Bargain Around San Francisco</p>",
