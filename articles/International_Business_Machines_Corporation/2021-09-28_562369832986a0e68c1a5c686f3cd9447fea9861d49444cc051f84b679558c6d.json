  "text": "<p>For decades we called them waiters and waitresses. Then one day, without warning, it all changed. The woman who just yesterday was my \"waitress\" strode up to the table and said \"Hi, my name is Amy, and I'll be your server tonight.\" Political correctness had overtaken restaurants.</p><p>The first industry to be \"corrected\" was airlines. Initially, because they were primarily female, the people who helped you find your seat on an airplane and served your meal were called \"hostesses\" or \"stewardesses.\" Today's Association of Flight Attendants union was founded in 1945 as the Airline Stewardess Association. The term \"stewardess\" was no doubt borrowed from the Navy, where stewards fulfilled the same role for over a century. Here the change made sense, however, since the traditional term \"stewardess\" no longer reflected the changing workplace. By the 1980s the male share of airline stewards was about 20%. Exit \"stewardess,\" enter the epicene \"flight attendant.\"</p><p>The switch to \"server\" was similarly made to remove gender from the equation, apparently in the continuing inexplicable cultural attempt to remove all differences between the sexes. But why?</p><p>The neutral \"server\" is annoying for three reasons. First, the word \"serve\" derives from the Latin \"servus,\" which means \"slave.\" That hardly seems a woke choice. The word \"wait\" has no invidious implications.</p><p>Second, whenever possible, a word should provide as much information as possible. That \"waiter\" and \"waitress\" convey both profession and sex is a boon, not a drawback. We get more value for our word buck.</p><p>Third, it \"corrects\" a problem that was never a problem. Unlike in the airline industry, waiting tables wasn't a job that had been disproportionately the realm of one sex. Hence there was no need to change the terminology. And although some actresses prefer to be called \"actors,\" Frances McDormand still received the 2021 Academy Award for best actress. Seems Hollywood is less woke than it would have you believe. I bet if there were an awards ceremony for restaurant servers, they'd be clamoring to bring \"waiter\" and \"waitress\" back.</p><p>I have firsthand experience in the corporate gender conundrum. Just out of college and struggling to make a living as a musician in Boston, I survived with temp work. My mother had insisted I learn to type in grade school. By my early twenties, I could burn up an IBM Selectric as well as any woman. Even though the company I worked for had changed its name to Kelly Services in 1966, in the early '80s people still called their employees (me included) \"Kelly Girls.\" But the pay was so good, I didn't care what they called me.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Opelka is a musical-theater composer-lyricist.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: A Trans-Atlantic Confusion\" -- WSJ Oct. 4, 2021)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
