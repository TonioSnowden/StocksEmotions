  "text": "<p>   How much pain will U.S. workers need to endure if inflation is to return to 2%? </p><p>   Not much, say most economists. Unemployment is expected to plateau near 4.3% at the end of next year, up from 3.6% in June, according to The Wall Street Journal's latest survey of economists. </p><p>   A great deal, according to other economists, who say unemployment might need to rise as high as 10%, implying a deep recession and much higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. </p><p>   The answer hinges on how recent economic shocks, from the pandemic to Ukraine, have altered how people think about inflation, and how low unemployment can go without generating persistent inflation overshoots. For the pessimists, a return to the prepandemic U.S. labor market, with 2% inflation and unemployment of about 4% or less, isn't possible for now. </p><p>   One point where economists mostly agree: Inflation will probably fall significantly over the next year or so without the Fed having to do anything, as recent large increases in energy and commodity prices drop out of future readings and supply disruptions resolve. </p><p>   After that, inflation might be running at about 4.5% or 5%, or as low as 2.5%, according to various measures of underlying inflation. Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank combines a variety of approaches and concludes that trend inflation is 3.3%. </p><p>   To get it to 2%, the Fed will need to cool the labor market and lower wage growth, currently around 5% to 7% a year, according to data from the Labor Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. That effort starts by reducing the number of job vacancies, which are historically high relative to unemployed workers. </p><p>   As the number of openings declines, unemployment tends to rise. The relationship between job openings and unemployment is expressed by the Beveridge curve, named for the British economist William Beveridge. </p><p>   This time may be different, say some economists and Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who told reporters last week that the number of job openings could fall significantly without a big rise in unemployment. </p><p>   In a paper published Friday, Fed governor Christopher Waller used the Beveridge curve to argue that unemployment might increase by 1 percentage point or less, even with a large decline in the vacancy rate. </p><p>   Vacancies are so high relative to available workers, the paper argued, that new job openings generate fewer and fewer hires. That means a given decline in vacancies will have a smaller effect on unemployment than in a normal labor market. </p><p>   Other economists say that such a free lunch is unlikely. </p><p>   Since the 1950s, every time the vacancy rate came down from a quarterly peak, it was accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment, according to a paper by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard. </p><p>   Moreover, the post-Covid economy may be less efficient at matching job seekers to job openings. That suggests higher unemployment might be needed, for a given number of vacancies, to stabilize wages and prices -- a measure known as the natural rate of unemployment. </p><p>   During the pandemic, jobs shifted geographically, putting them out of reach of some workers. Certain skills became more important while others were less in demand. The Fed can't do anything to fix such mismatches. </p><p>   Fed officials \"rely on labor market efficiency somehow going back to where it was before the pandemic,\" said Stephen Cecchetti, a finance professor at Brandeis International Business School. \"You can't rule it out, but it seems unlikely.\" </p><p>   Mr. Powell said that natural unemployment may have risen \"materially,\" at least temporarily. Since before the pandemic, Fed officials have put the long-run unemployment rate -- similar to the natural rate -- at around 4%. </p><p>   Raising unemployment to this new, higher natural rate might not be enough to control inflation, either. If high inflation has become deeply ingrained in the thinking of households and businesses, it will take much higher unemployment, and a punishing recession, to wring it out. </p><p>   How much higher? One concept is known as the sacrifice ratio, which measures how much unemployment needs to increase to cause inflation to fall by 1 percentage point. </p><p>   Mr. Summers estimates a  sacrifice ratio of two, meaning it would take one year of unemployment running 2 percentage points above its natural rate for inflation to decline by 1 point, according to a June speech at the London School of Economics. He estimates a natural unemployment rate of 5% and that inflation needs to decline by about 2.5 percentage points to reach 2%. </p><p>   U.S. households and investors don't seem to expect a return to the 1970s, yet. A July University of Michigan survey found that consumers expected prices to rise at an annual rate of 2.9% over the next five years. </p><p>   Still, some economists are wary of relying on measures of expected inflation. Businesses set wages and prices based mainly on what they see in the economy rather than on general inflation, said Mr. Cecchetti. He thinks the Fed will probably need to increase its policy rate above 4.5%, and push unemployment to between 5.5% and 6%, to control inflation. </p><p></p>",
