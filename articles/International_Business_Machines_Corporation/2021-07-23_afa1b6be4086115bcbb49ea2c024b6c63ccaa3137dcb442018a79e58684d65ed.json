  "text": "<h2>Marlowe: restore or replace</h2> <p>Are two acquisition roll-ups better than one? It's a question for Restore shareholders following a hostile attempt by the dealmaking team that built the company to take back control.</p> <p>Business services group Marlowe <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=1323-15068599-31HLBQESAEAT2SOTJ3A7NG4NII\">went public</a> on Thursday with a £743m offer for Restore, its Aim-quoted lookalike. Having had two proposals <a href=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/news/2021/07/22/restore-rebuffs-marlowe-takeover-offer/\">privately rejected</a> over the past few weeks, Marlowe took the direct approach with a pitch at 530p per share, of which 71p would be paid in cash and the remainder in equity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=RST%3ALSE\">Restore</a> said the offers underestimated its prospects. It said Marlowe, whose operations centre around corporate compliance and certification, had been too stingy with cash and had failed to provide any strategically compelling reasons to merge.</p> <p>The bear hug pits Restore's new management team against Alex Dacre and Charles Skinner, who were central to its previous success. On the opposing side is former TalkTalk and IBM executive Charles Bligh, who took over as chief executive in 2019.</p> <p>Dacre, Marlowe's youthful founder and chief, was previously in charge of mergers and acquisitions at Restore. Skinner spent a decade as Bligh's predecessor and is on the Marlowe board as a non-executive director. They will be joined later this year by Adam Counsell, who was Restore's financial director for most of Skinner's tenure.</p> <p>The appointment reunites a team whose buy-and-build strategy transformed Restore from a dormant cash shell into a market leader in records and information management. Using a hostile strategy means Marlowe's lobbying of shareholders, up to now a clandestine affair involving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1360494e-7d85-11e1-bfa5-00144feab49a\">wall crossing</a> and non-disclosure agreements, can be brought into the open. </p> <p>Key investors to win over include Slater Investments and Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, which are top 10 shareholders of both companies.</p> <p>In the background is Michael Ashcroft, the billionaire former Conservative party treasurer, who rescued Restore from being crushed by its debt pile in the wake of the financial crisis and then sold out at a profit in 2013. Ashcroft remains Marlowe's biggest investor, having floated the company as a cash shell in partnership with Dacre in 2015.</p> <h2>Ralph Ward: serious business</h2> <p>Knock it off. That's the advice of corporate governance expert and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boardroominside?lang=en\">self-identifying curmudgeon</a> Ralph Ward, who used an online seminar hosted by board management software start-up Shaparency this week to upbraid any budding Elon Musks in the audience. </p> <p>“You're dealing with some very high-powered important people in a board setting,” he said. “These are all alphas, they are all leaders, they are all subconsciously jockeying for position. If you have one person who is being clever at someone else's expense, that's going to leave a sting and it makes it harder to deal with. If I were a board chair, I would generally say, ‘No one likes a smart-ass, especially at a board meeting.'“</p> <h2>Morrisons: till the bitter end</h2> <p>One of Sir Ken Morrison's most-quoted barbs relates to how he could employ two checkout workers for the price of one non-executive director. The late supermarket magnate might not have been too impressed by Wm Morrison's latest experiment into having no cashiers at all.</p> <p>Morrisons has been testing a checkout-free grocery shop at its Bradford headquarters, using a similar model to Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2bdc95a-1d05-4f59-b255-9c0d84480896\">just-walk-out convenience stores</a>. The pilot, first revealed by <a href=\"https://www.retail-week.com/grocery/morrisons-trials-checkout-less-store-tech-at-bradford-hq/7040297.article\">Retail Week</a> and known internally as Project Sarah, is open only to Morrisons staff, though if judged a success, plans are in place to roll it out more widely.</p> <p>Queue-free shopping trials continue even as the path clears for Morrisons to fall into private equity ownership, which might put a different complexion on any initiative that looks counter to Sir Ken's legacy. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice was on Thursday given a Takeover Panel deadline of August 9 to make a counter-offer to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0219a-6acb-4e17-be9f-69c54c85e330\">£9.5bn agreed bid</a> from a Fortress-led consortium, or walk away.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'An unwelcome takeover approach is pulling Restore back to the future' FT.com 23 July.
