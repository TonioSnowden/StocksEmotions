  "title": "Stock Futures Retreat After Three-Day Rally; All three major U.S. stock indexes are on pace to end the week with gains",
  "text": "<p>In premarket trading, a sharp plunge in Snap shares weighed on growth stocks. Snap lost 28% before the opening bell after posting its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth as a public company. Shares of Meta Platforms and Alphabet pulled back 4.8% and 2.9%, respectively. Later Friday, investors will parse earnings reports from companies including Twitter.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are on pace to end the week in solidly positive territory, offering a respite to investors who have seen their portfolios pummeled this year. One bright spot this week has been a stretch of earnings reports that have given investors confidence to wade in and scoop up beaten-down stocks. Companies including Netflix and IBM have been among those who beat Wall Street expectations, even as firms across all sectors contend with obstacles including a strong dollar and inflationary labor pressures.</p><p>This week marked the return of a familiar trade that dominated in recent years: Buying shares of tech companies. The Nasdaq Composite has risen 5.3% this week, based on Thursday's closing prices, outpacing the S&amp;P 500's 3.5% rise. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla have emerged as among the biggest gainers this week, with shares of all three companies rising 13% or more, through Thursday.</p><p>Nonetheless, few investors say they are willing to call a bottom to a selloff that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 16% this year. Worries about persistently high inflation, the possibility of a recession and the war in Ukraine remain on the forefront of investors' minds.</p><p>\"I think investors are fishing for the bottom,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research. But, he said, \"I still would be cautious.\"</p><p>Mr. Brzeski noted that next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve, as well as U.S. gross domestic product data, could inject more volatility in the markets.</p><p>Investors will continue to keep a close watch on events in Europe, including the continuing uncertainty around the flow of Russian natural gas through the critical Nord Stream pipeline. Brent crude fell 0.3% to $99.19 a barrel Friday.</p><p>Traders will also be watching for the ripple effects from the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Thursday. Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB stock index fell 0.2% Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 traded roughly flat. The euro retreated 0.9% against the dollar to $1.0138, raising the possibility that Europe's common currencycould reach parity again.</p><p>Investors continued to assess the European Central Bank'slarger-than-expected interest-rate increase on Thursday, as well French and German flash purchasing managers' data for July that came in below expectations.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.844%, down from 2.908% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>In Asia, trading was fairly flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.1%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Retreat After Three-Day Rally</p>",
