  "text": "<p>Nationwide, the UK's second-largest mortgage lender, will allow the majority of its 13,000 office-based staff to carry on working from home full-time if they wish after the end of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The building society said it would introduce a “work anywhere” policy after more than 4,500 employees responded to an internal survey saying that they would like to work from home five days a week.</p> <p>Joe Garner, Nationwide chief executive, said in an interview that he personally plans to work remotely one to two days a week, to reassure staff that they will not be punished or damage their own career prospects by choosing not to come into an office.</p> <p>“Whatever leaderships of organisations say they want to happen, people will follow behaviour more than words,” said Garner. “The evidence so far is showing you can have better outcomes, productivity, and wellbeing by being more flexible. But if organisations want that to happen, the leadership needs to behave the same way.”</p> <p>In its survey of more than 8,500 staff, Nationwide said only 6 per cent of respondents wanted to work in an office five days a week, though Garner stressed that it would continue to provide enough office space for any employees who wanted to work there.</p> <p>Businesses in all sectors are grappling with how far to return to traditional working patterns once the pandemic recedes and offices fully reopen. Many employees are keen to keep the greater flexibility offered by remote working, but there are also concerns about the disproportionate pressure that it has placed on women and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7c8ce81-8e81-4d67-8104-4f6b3174958a\">young people</a> during the pandemic.</p> <p>Many large companies have said they expect to move towards a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2ad4ae3-6b40-4051-a6fe-6f8a75924e30\"> “hybrid” model </a>of home- and office-based work, though most are still working out the details. A few executives have been more strident — Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon last month described homeworking as an “aberration that we're going to correct as quickly as possible”.</p> <p>Nationwide's shift will allow it to permanently close three satellite offices near its Swindon headquarters. It will also advertise non-branch based jobs without a fixed location, “so we can recruit talented individuals where they are, not where the office is,” the company said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cost-cutting was not a driving factor behind the decision, according to Garner: “if indeed we're more productive and making better decisions [working from home], the benefits can be multiples of the hard cost saved”.</p> <p>He added, however, that “it is important that employers are sensitive to diverse and different needs, and therefore we do see a role for office spaces. They're also important for collaboration, creativity and social connection”.</p> <p>A report and survey commissioned by Nationwide and completed in partnership with big companies such as asset manager BlackRock and technology company IBM found widespread support for flexible working in the wider population, but it also noted several drawbacks.</p> <p>The report said “hard won advances in workplace equality have been put at risk” by the pandemic, with women bearing the brunt of increased childcare and schooling responsibilities, and being more likely to lose their jobs.</p> <p>Ketish Pothalingam, executive vice-president of Pimco, a $2.1tn investment group, also said in the report that 16-24 year-olds had been “disproportionately affected in terms of decline in employment and overall working outlook”, which would be a problem for companies and policymakers to address.</p> <p>Earlier this week Jane Fraser, the new chief executive of US bank Citigroup,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3a54eee-c741-4ced-9572-ac02b3990db9\"> warned</a> against an unsustainable blurring of the lines between work and home. Emphasising the importance of the office for collaboration and camaraderie, she told staff that in future the majority of roles at the bank would require at least three days a week in the office. </p> <p>Meanwhile a recent presentation by junior bankers at Goldman Sachs complained of working <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">95-hour weeks</a> and highlighted the strain that the past year had placed on some young employees' physical and mental health.&#xa0;</p> <p>Separately on Thursday, Santander said it would shut four UK offices by the end of the year, and reduce the size of four more, including its current headquarters in London. It said a new £150m campus already under construction in Milton Keynes would become its new UK headquarters.</p> <p>The bank said the 5,000 UK staff affected by office closures would be offered new arrangements combining homeworking with “access to local spaces designed to enable team collaboration”.<br><br>Nathan Bostock, Santander UK chief executive, said: “The pandemic has accelerated the existing trend towards greater flexible working, and our colleagues have told us this has brought significant benefits for many of them.”<br><br>The bank also said it would reduce its branch network in Britain by about a fifth, reflecting a shift towards online transactions.</p><p>Source: Nicholas Megaw in London 2021 'Nationwide to allow all office-based employees to ‘work anywhere'' FT.com 25 March.
