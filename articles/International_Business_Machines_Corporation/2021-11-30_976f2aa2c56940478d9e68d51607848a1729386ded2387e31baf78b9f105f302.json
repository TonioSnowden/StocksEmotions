  "text": "<p>As a child, I became a voracious reader and loved pulling out volumes of the encyclopedia to comb the pages. Some entries were for younger kids and some for older ones. I thought all of it was interesting.</p><p>My mom and her mother founded a private school 10 minutes by car from our home in Huntsville, Ala. In the small schoolhouse, teachers taught first grade through fourth in one room and fifth through eighth in another. As a first-grader, I was fascinated by subjects taught to older kids in our room.</p><p>I grew up in a redbrick ranch house in the northwest part of the city. We lived near the Marshall Space Flight Center, where NASA conducted its rocketry research. Our windows sometimes rattled when they tested.</p><p>My father also was named Jimmy, but with a different middle name so I wouldn't get nicknamed Junior in school and taunted. Dad was the manager of a local supermarket.</p><p>On Sundays, when the store was closed, I'd go with him to make sure the refrigeration units were running. It was super cool to be in a 15-aisle supermarket when it was empty. All the shelves were stocked and neat. Everything was colorful and amazing.</p><p>My mom, Doris, and her mother, Erma, ran House of Learning. Mom was more academic-minded than my father. She eventually returned to school to become a pharmacist. At home, she was a gadget freak. We were among the very first in town to have a Betamax VCR. She had a habit of buying early and choosing the wrong technology.</p><p>I thought learning in one big room with kids of different ages was great. There were just four kids in each grade. The schoolhouse operated in breakout sessions, with kids in each grade working in clusters.</p><p>Teachers spent time with each group, and the groups often interacted with each other. My grandmother had an expression: \"Each one, teach one.\" Older kids often taught the younger ones.</p><p>My advanced reading ability allowed me to start school a year early. As a result, I was always the youngest in each grade by a wide margin. In ninth grade, I went to the Randolph School, a small private college-prep school with about 40 students.</p><p>See More House Calls</p><p>* Childhood Yarns Told in the Dark Led Diana Gabaldon to Write 'Outlander'</p><p>* 'Belfast' Actress Caitríona Balfe Was Discovered at a Supermarket</p><p>* How Doors Guitarist Robby Krieger Went From Being Hazed to Being Cool in School</p><p>I wasn't particularly popular. My sports career was weak, because I was too young and too short. But I had my group of friends who were mostly geeks. We'd discuss geeky topics.</p><p>One of my failings that would wind up being an advantage later was doing whatever interested me. Not exactly a wise strategy in high school. I constantly heard someone say, \"He's just got so much potential.\"</p><p>I was smart enough, but I didn't figure everything out. For instance, I was exceptionally good at math, but I never cracked the formula for writing English papers.</p><p>At 16, after I graduated from high school, I majored in finance at Auburn University. Then I went on to get a masters at the University of Alabama and worked toward a Ph.D. in finance from Indiana University before leaving early in 1992. I moved to Chicago to become a futures trader.</p><p>Computers always interested me. My uncle owned a music store when I was a kid but eventually opened the town's first computer store in the late 1970s, before the IBM PC came out.</p><p>Mom, the gadget maven, had an early Eagle computer, which was an integrated word processor and spreadsheet, and then a Commodore. She tracked the family finances and did our taxes on them. My uncle taught me the basics of programming.</p><p>From the start in 2001, I envisioned Wikipedia as a company with just one employee who did coding. The rest would be handled by those who volunteered to write and edit entries and monitor them.</p><p>Initially, people thought of me as some sort of raging antibusiness communist. I just wanted to continue getting up each day and doing whatever I thought was most interesting.</p><p>Today, my wife, Kate, and I divide our time between a house we rent in London and a house we own in England's Cotswolds region. Our two children go to school in London, so we need to be there.</p><p>Our country house is on a river, and we have a beautiful view. When we arrive and open the door, our two girls run through the house and out the back to the garden. It's beautiful to watch.</p><p>My childhood encyclopedia seems to have gone missing. My father says it's in the shed, my mother insists we sold it years ago. One of these days I have to go through there to find it. For now, our daughters have their iPads.</p><p>Jimmy's Joys</p><p>Passionate about cooking? Yes, for family and friends. I have a nice big kitchen in the country. I love my Wüsthof knives and Smeg range.</p><p>Your kitchen? My wife used to push back when I called it my kitchen. Now she has conceded it's my kitchen.</p><p>Do you constantly monitor Wiki entries? I'm not the most active editor by a wide margin.</p><p>Wiki entry post you created? Mzoli's restaurant near Cape Town, South Africa. I was taken there by a journalist.</p><p>Worried about the accuracy of Wiki? We make it as good as we possibly can, but we know it isn't perfect. On the other hand, it's pretty good.</p><p>Wikipedia Co-Founder Jimmy Wales Was Educated in a One-Room Schoolhouse</p>",
