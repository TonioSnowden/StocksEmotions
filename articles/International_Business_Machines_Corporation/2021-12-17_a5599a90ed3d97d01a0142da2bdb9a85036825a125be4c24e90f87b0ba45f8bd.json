  "text": "<p>   Financier Brett Barakett and his wife, Meaghan Barakett, have sold their waterfront home in Greenwich, Conn., for $50 million, according to public records. </p><p>   The eight-bedroom home on the Belle Haven peninsula was listed for $55 million in April. </p><p>   The anonymous buyer bought the house through a Delaware-based limited liability company. </p><p>   Mr. Barakett is founder and chief executive of global asset management fund Tremblant Capital. </p><p>   \"Mr. Barakett movedto Palm Beach with his family and is now living there full time, given Tremblant has opened an office in the area,\" said Mike Geller, a spokesman for Tremblant Capital. In July 2019 Mr. Barakett paid $15.165 million for a house in Palm Beach, records show. </p><p>   The Greenwich house, designed by Connecticut architecture firm Shope Reno Wharton, has a 60-foot indoor pool. The roughly 2 1/2-acre property has 340 feet of frontage on Long Island Sound with a stone jetty and deep-water dock. </p><p>   The grounds also include an outdoor pool, a sports court, vegetable gardens, fruit tree orchards, a chicken coop and an electric-vehicle charging station. </p><p>   Mr. Barakett purchased the land in 2005 and replaced a 1950s-era house with a Georgian-style stone mansion, where the Baraketts were married in 2016. </p><p>   The land was once part of an early 1900s racetrack and was later owned by the late former IBM chief Thomas Watson Jr. </p><p>   Leslie McElwreath of Sotheby's International Realty, who had the Greenwich listing with colleague Joseph Barbieri, declined to comment. </p><p>   The buyer was represented by Douglas Elliman. Dina Goldentayer, a Douglas Elliman agent in Miami Beach, was a consulting agent. </p><p>   Luxury homes in Fairfield County, where Greenwich is located, sold for an average of about $3.39 million in the third quarter of 2021, up over 14% compared with the same period last year, according to a report by Douglas Elliman. </p><p>   Greenwich, which saw a real-estate turnaround in the pandemic, had its lowest single-family inventory and highest number of single-family sales on record in the third quarter, according to the report. </p><p></p>",
