  "text": "<p>In their reporting on the scramble to join the environmental, social and governance bandwagon, Michael O'Dwyer and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a47fb4a-4a10-4c05-8c5d-02d83052bee7\">Report</a>, August 30) fail to mention the UK's Big Four accounting firms' contribution to the World Economic Forum's 2020 promotion of stakeholder capitalism and the need for consistency of sustainability reporting. </p> <p>This guidance sets out how ESG and the UN's sustainable development goals should be measured and reported. As an active nonagenarian and career-long auditor there is no doubt in my mind these metrics will always need to be assured independently for their accuracy, reliability and the trust we can place on them. Who better to do this than trained auditors — internal and external with today and tomorrow's technology — but, only if the quality of their work is also measured and assured. </p> <p>ESG is not a new requirement, nor is stakeholder capitalism. Peter Drucker and John Humble in the 1970s both proclaimed on the environmental and social responsibilities of management and companies. R Edward Freeman promoted his stakeholder theory in the 1980s. </p> <p>The Prince of Wales founded today's Business in the Community in the 1980s, and has been promoting environmental and social company responsibilities to this day. The Commonwealth too has embedded ESG in its governance practices and reporting, pioneering much of today's ESG debate and practices, supported at that time by my own institute.</p> <p>Sustainability has been on the UN's agenda from the beginning of this century. But who was listening then, and who is now? And how sure are we its targets will all be achieved? </p> <p>How future generations judge today's ESG reporting, measuring, assessment and independent assurance must be on the agenda of all boards of directors and their audit and risk committees. Evidence today shows the ESG bandwagon has too few travellers. This has to change, for the planet, for all people and for the prosperity of all nations. </p> <p><strong>Jeffrey Ridley</strong> <br><em>Visiting Professor of Corporate Governance Assurance, <br>Lincoln International Business School, University of Lincoln; <br>Fellow, The Corporate Governance Institute; Past President Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors, <br>Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: More bosses must get aboard the bandwagon on ESG reporting' FT.com 5 September.
