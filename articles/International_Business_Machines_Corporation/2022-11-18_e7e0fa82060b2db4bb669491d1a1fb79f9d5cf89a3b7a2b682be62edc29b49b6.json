  "text": "<p>With its shares rising as much as 8% Friday, the company's stock is at a 9% decline year to date. In comparison, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF HACK is down 27% year to date, the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF CIBR is off 24%, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down 17% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP is off 29%.</p><p>Citi Research analyst Fatima Boolani, who has a buy rating, said in a Friday note that the company \"handily cleared all key growth and profitability hurdles.\"</p><p>While it was another beat-and-raise quarter, Boolani acknowledged the restraint in the \"raise\" part, which she said signaled \"prudence against budget/large deal scrutiny\" that the company \"is seeing in pockets, and where Palo Alto Networks' proactive deal rigor/pipeline coverage offer estimate risk backstop.\"</p><p>Jefferies analyst Joseph Gallo, who has also has a buy rating, applauded the company's annual recurring revenue, or ARR, growth of 67% and said that durable booking helped as deal cycles elongate. ARR is a metric often used by software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies to show how much revenue the company can expect based on subscriptions.</p><p>Gallo, however, said he was keeping an eye on billings growth, which slowed with only a 27% year-over-year gain, and on a slowdown of large-deal growth, which was at its lowest since the middle of 2019.</p><p>Stifel analyst Adam Borg, who has a buy rating, said Palo Alto Networks' report \"checked all the boxes.\"</p><p>\"Net/net, we continue to believe Palo has a number of drivers to sustain at least 20%+ top-line growth and operating-margin/free cash flow expansion in coming years,\" Borg said. \"More broadly, we continue to believe that Palo is well positioned to be a natural consolidator of cybersecurity spend and that its growth/profitability characteristics provide a degree of defensibility in uncertain times.\"</p><p>Of the 41 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 37 have buy-grade ratings and four have hold ratings. The stock hasn't carried a sell rating from any analyst surveyed by FactSet since January 2022. Of the analysts covering the stock, 10 raised and six lowered their price targets, resulting in an average of $217.87, down from a previous $219.21, according to FactSet data.</p><p>While Palo Alto Networks isn't on the S&amp;P 500, it is on the Nasdaq 100 NDX, where it's the 32nd-best performer in the year to date. But among tech companies, the only better performers are analog chip makers like Texas Instruments Inc. TXN and Analog Devices Inc. ADI and video-game publishers Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI — which is just waiting for the Microsoft Corp. MSFT acquisition to close — and Electronic Arts Inc. EA.</p><p>Although it's not on the Nasdaq 100, the only better-performing stocks in the field of enterprise software of much import are those of International Business Machines Inc. IBM, which is up more than 10% year to date, and product management software company PTC Inc. PTC, which is up 1% year to date.</p><p>Palo Alto Networks one of 2022's best software stocks after another beat-and-raise quarter</p>",
