  "text": "<p>Can a blazer look both historic and fresh? This one, with emphatic shoulders and a wasp waist, recalls Christian Dior's Bar Jacket from the celebrated 1947 \"New Look\" collection and, in our opinion, achieves that tricky objective. New York brand Rentrayage has made it from red-and-blue plaid wool deadstock (in this case, leftover fabric sourced from Italian warehouses). If passed down, it might just represent the \"New New Look\" of 2047. Ramblette Blazer, $850, Rentrayage.com</p><p>2. Actual Rose Colored Glasses</p><p>Stacked into a tower or imprinted with a saucy red-lipstick pucker, these cherry-blossom-pink coupes from Kuwaiti homeware brand Ecru look like a hand-me-down from your great-grandmother, if your great-grandmother was Dorothy Parker. Made in India, the glasses flaunt a hand-etched star pattern that confers considerable sparkle on any cocktail contained therein. The vibe is most certainly vintage, in a particular bon-mot-slinging, jumping-in-a-fountain-in-your-tuxedo kind of way. Pink Star Coupes Set of Four, $120, EcruOnline.in</p><p>3. Posters for Posterity</p><p>For anyone who's happily afflicted with wanderlust, a vintage travel poster is affordable art that can really transport. The pool of possibilities is deep. Take, for example, a cute illustration of a 1960s Danish fisherman for $225 (via Chisholm Larsson Gallery, pictured alongside other offerings from Chisholm Larsson) or a colorful 1930s Hawaii/South Seas Matson Line luggage label for $75 (from International Poster Gallery) or an original lithograph from Portugal's travel board that declares, with hilarious graphics, \"respect the tourist,\" for $69 (via The Vintage Poster).</p><p>4. Penguin Classic</p><p>The humble cocktail shaker is an eternal essential for amateur bartenders, even just as a deep vessel for drinks that need to be stirred. The easiest-to-use ones include a strainer, so that you can pour your finished drink directly into a glass without scrounging around for a separate spring strainer. This shaker is so equipped -- and shaped like an adorable penguin, telegraphing frostiness like crazy. Penguin Cocktail Shaker, $38, Viski.com</p><p>5. A Tough Ax To Follow</p><p>An ax has obvious utility. What else chops firewood? But you'd be hard pressed to find one that could serve as a bona fide showpiece. That is unless you're browsing the wares at Motor City Axe. The Detroit-based company sources a wide variety of vintage cutters, which it then restores and sometimes paints in vibrant colors. It also carves its own line of axes out of American hickory wood, like this one. Motor City \"The Up North\" Camp Axe, $107, MotorCityAxe.com</p><p>6. Pretty as a Picture</p><p>Lockets are meant to be passed down through generations and, while unusually petite at half-an-inch tall, this 14-karat yellow-gold iteration strikes us as entirely qualified for that role. (Petite means discreet.) From Brooklyn brand Catbird, it can be strung onto a variety of the brand's chains -- and filled with a meaningful, if tiny, photo of your giftee's choice. Get it engraved with a single letter for a personal touch. Dollhouse Locket Necklace, $168, CatbirdNYC.com</p><p>7. A Clearly Modern Hanukkah</p><p>The traditional menorah becomes a covetable work of contemporary art in this interpretation, designed by the self-proclaimed \"Modernist Judaica\" label Via Maris. Colorful glass creates a sculptural silhouette that is anything but ordinary, a look that a Hanukkah-celebrating aesthete will value for the foreseeable future. Glass Chanukiah, $235, Via-Maris.com</p><p>8. Spice and Everything Nice</p><p>Saffron's aroma is fleeting, but this timeless tool, designed expressly to grind the world's costliest spice, will endure. The mortar and pestle remains the best technology for getting maximum flavor out of the red-gold stigmas of the saffron crocus. A collaboration between Seattle's Madisonware Ceramics andVilla Jerada, purveyor of Moroccan and Levantine pantry products, this one comes in a kit with a 1-gram tin of Moroccan saffron. Saffron Mortar &amp; Pestle Kit, $52, VillaJerada.com</p><p>9. Staying Power</p><p>For a history buff, a membership to the National Trust for Historic Preservation is a slam dunk: It functions as a curated travel guide to more than 500 landmarks, and revenue goes to saving important places. Buy in at the $20 level for discounts at Historic Hotels of America, including the Greyfield Inn in Georgia, a Carnegie mansion. The $250 Preservation Council Steward level adds reduced rates at Historic Hotels Worldwide, such as the original Raffles (c. 1887) in Singapore, and includes two gift memberships, because isn't it better to give as well as receive? SupportSavingPlaces.org</p><p>10. Knit to Last</p><p>Wait, a holiday sweater that isn't ugly? With a traditional Andean pattern, this cheery knit steers clear of dancing elves, singing spruces and blinking-nosed Rudolphs. Los Angeles brand Industry of All Nations worked with a co-op of farmers and knitters in Bolivia to create this exemplar of classic coziness, which is hand-knit from resilient alpaca wool that will see out many chilly winters. Alpaca Hand-Knit Sweater, $380, IndustryofAllNations.com</p><p>11. Warm Memories (Splurge!)</p><p>Is your family's attic cluttered with baby clothes that haven't seen daylight since the Carter administration? Here's an idea: Liberate those dresses and dungarees from the cobwebby recesses, then enlist Brooklyn-based quilter Zak Foster to fashion them into a custom \"memory-quilt.\" The personalized process is rooted in conversation and, once the quilt has been started, takes about 4 to 6 weeks to finish -- resulting in a piece of functional art that will warm beds and hearts for generations. Custom Memory Quilt, from $1,500, ZakFoster.com</p><p>12. Never-ending Nosh</p><p>Ah, the season of cut-glass dishes filled with festive snacks, ready to extend hospitality to any visitor, caroler or portly red-suited gentleman who might show up. Pass on this tradition with the gift of dried fruits and nuts from Ziba, a company committed to an ethical supply chain and the proliferation of delicious heirloom varieties. This variety pack includes two types of heirloom almonds and the coveted Afghan kishmish raisins, known as \"the gummy bear raisin.\" Variety Pack, $57 for 7 (5 ounce) bags, ZibaFoods.com</p><p>13. Excellent Points</p><p>While plenty of apps can turn a phone into a compass, they're nothing one could bequeath to one's children. A better bet: the stainless-steel Voyager compass from the Scottish menswear brand Dalvey. Engrave the compass with your giftee's initials, or -- if you're feeling more verbose -- opt to get a message inscribed on the Voyager's shell. Voyager Compass in Blue Mother of Pearl, $139, from $14 for engraving, Dalvey.com</p><p>14. A Familiar Face</p><p>Though our homes are lousy with digital timekeepers, it's nice to have a couple of hands and big old numbers to tell the hour less coldly. This redesign of IBM's Indicator Clock, a midcentury stalwart of factory and classroom walls that's over 13 inches across, includes a glass crystal and dusky-red steel housing. Tap into a Boomer's nostalgia or a Zoomer's penchant for all things analog by giving this bold, battery-powered ticker. 1960s IBM Standard Issue Clock in Paprika, $299, Schoolhouse.com</p><p>15. Dash Away!</p><p>\"Dad, is it time to put the reindeer in the front yard?\" Holiday rituals with the potential to last generations can develop organically -- or they can be born of a big box containing a cloven-hoofed rattan figure adorned with 240 LEDs that will eventually become part of the family. At nearly 5-feet tall, this majestic stag can be lit in a choice of three different shades. Harlow Grey Rattan Leaping Stag Reindeer Light Up Outdoor Figure, $350, Lights4Fun.com</p><p>16. Top-Quality Topper (Splurge!)</p><p>By issuing soothing sounds, ASMR audio clips are meant to trigger tingling sensations. Their sartorial equivalent might be the quietly seductive wares of San Francisco designer Evan Kinori. In a brown, rust and cream tweed, this hand-numbered jacket has the sort of boxy cut we like for layering over hoodies and knits. Forgoing logos, loud prints and style-stupidity, this impeccably crafted piece bears little resemblance to passing fads. Zip Jacket, $965, EvanKinori.com</p><p>17. Simmer Lovin'</p><p>The artisans at Netherton Foundry in Shropshire, England, make hand-spun, black-iron cookware inspired by the region's 18th- and 19th-century iron masters. Launched in collaboration with cult British brand Toast, this stately stockpot takes soups, stews and curries as well as saucy oven roasts in its stride. Pre-seasoned with flax oil, the naturally nonstick surface thrives in high-temperature cooking. The beautiful, bulletproof construction will see this pot through many, many iterations of family recipes as they're passed down. Toast x Netherton Foundry Iron Stockpot, $145, US.Toa.st</p><p>18. A Weave Much to Be Desired</p><p>Do you have giftees with depressingly white walls? Treat them to a colorful composition by London artist Dalia James, who crafts meticulous Bauhaus-inspired weavings using heritage techniques and biodegradable bamboo, wool and silk that's been hand-dyed, so no two pieces are the same. Toast x Dalia James Hand Woven Artwork, $375, US.Toa.st</p><p>19. Whoa, Nice Skirt</p><p>For too long, green and red have dominated Christmas decor. This Technicolor tree skirt is here to usher in a more worldly, colorful tradition. Weavers sew together vintage Frezada blankets -- made of sheep's wool hearty enough to warm the people of the Andean highlands and weather countless holidays -- to create a festive statement piece. Be warned: May steal attention from the wrapped gifts nearby. But for design lovers, that is a happy problem to have. Coral Frazada Tree Skirt, $225, STFrank.com</p><p>20. Best Buds</p><p>Ceramics cognoscenti seek out art-historian-turned-potter Frances Palmer's vases for their classical shapes inspired by English earthenware and Japanese porcelain. The hitch? Their equally elevated prices. But here's a holiday miracle: The artisan has recently released an affordable new line of bud vases, hand-cast by a pottery in England's Stoke-on-Trent (the historic cradle of the British china industry) using molds made from her hand-thrown designs -- timeless gifts with serious ceramics cachet. Cirrus Bud Vases, from $190, FrancesPalmerPottery.com</p><p>21. Canine Canteens</p><p>Along with mattresses, toothbrushes and razors, pet accessories have been given the direct-to-consumer treatment. Wild One, which emerged in 2018, launched with a limited line of elegant, pastel-colored dog harnesses, leashes and poop bags. It has since expanded further, selling carriers, toys and home goods -- like these handsome dog bowls -- with a certain quality of longevity. Get the kit that includes two: one for kibble, one for water. Bowl Kit, $50, WildOne.com</p><p>22. Needle Dropper</p><p>We can't guarantee LPs will make it out of the 21st century. But no one expected them to survive the streaming boom either. And if any of your loved ones aspires to own \"The Who Sell Out\" (1967) or Nirvana's \"Bleach\" (1989) on vinyl, they're going to need something to play them with. Audio-Technica's record players have earned a reputation for great build-quality at reasonable prices, an underappreciated niche within hi-fi circles. LP60X, $149, Audio-Technica.com</p><p>23. Hold On To This</p><p>Embellished with golden beads, cinched with a slinky silk drawstring, this bag will be the life of any party -- not to discount your giftee's own charms. Part of the new Heirloom collection by California brand Doen, the hand-crocheted pouch emits old-school elegance and, with a comfortably slender handle, it can agreeably dangle from a wrist all night. It's unlikely to go missing even when she, ahem, has a little too much fun, so she can keep it for years -- and even pass it on. Lea Pochette Bag, $398, ShopDoen.com</p><p>24. Greens, Baby (Splurge!)</p><p>Cultivate a craving for heirloom produce year round with this compact indoor grow system. Under the full-spectrum LED grow light, baby greens shoot up fast, from seed to plate in 7-12 days. Made from powder-coated steel and food-grade high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the design looks sleek on a countertop, too. Seeds for everything from arugula to sunflower sprouts are sold separately, in individual packs, bundles and subscriptions of one, two or three \"grows\" per month. The Fieldhouse in Sod, $295, GrowLeath.com</p><p>25. A Glamorous Pill to Swallow</p><p>Does your loved one like to gulp vitamins on the go? Or have a penchant for chewing gum or popping Tic Tacs? This premium pillbox, just 1.25 inches tall, totes teensy things in style. Wrought from sterling silver and equipped with a twist-off lid, it was dreamed up by the late, great Italian jewelry designer Elsa Peretti. Decades after she introduced her iconic, organic designs, they're as covetable as ever. Thumbprint Pillbox, $150, Tiffany, 212-755-8000</p><p>26. Round Trip</p><p>Packed with nostalgic elegance, the hat box recalls trips by convertible to a country house in the Cotswolds, bellmen at the Viennese grande dame awaiting mountains of luggage and fancy occasions that required an array of bonnets. This modestly priced case from Calpak brings a whiff of glamour to today's ruthless travel but serves a practical purpose: It doubles as a smart weekend bag, one where your hat (and more) will survive the journey unscathed. Trnk Medium Hat Box in Black, $175, CalpakTravel.com. Inside the hatbox: Turtleneck Sweater, $595, Vince.com; Worth &amp; Worth Fellini Hat, $725, HatShop.com; One Day Toiletries Pouch, $490; Many Day Toiletries Pouch, $590, US.Metier.com</p><p>27. More Than a Pretty Case</p><p>If a ring is beautiful, its box should do that beauty justice -- just as handsome hyacinths merit a handsome vase. These cases come in one- or two-ring sizes, are crafted from wood with a high-gloss finish and are accented with decadent golden inlays. Someday, your giftee will probably pass on a ring she adores. Why not let her do so in style? Will You Single Ring Box, $178, Trove.Store; We Do Double Ring Box, $238, Trove.Store; Classic Wedding Band Rings, $2,400, $1,850, $1,150, Tiffany.com</p><p>28. The Dearest Diaries</p><p>Documenting one's adventures the old-fashioned way, on paper, ensures one's escapades will be discoverable to future generations, rather than, say, buried in Instagram feeds. With Papier's travel journals, choose among nearly 40 covers, each customizable with the traveler's name or initials and formatted for both planning and recording trips. British stationers Smythson's Off the Beaten Track Soho Travel Journal offers similar features, more poshly. Parakeets of London Travel Journal, $35, Papier.com; Off the Beaten Track Soho Travel Journal in Panama in Navy, $280, Smythson.com</p><p>29. Singular Shirt</p><p>When anything slightly daring is still considered iffy, it's rare to find a men's shirt with enduring charisma. But we think we succeeded: Crafty Los Angeles brand Atelier &amp; Repairs specializes in idiosyncratic designs, like this band-collar style, that make for memorable gifts. The shirt has one button that's a different color than the rest (a subtle quirk) and a patch pocket of antique Japanese fabric. Finished with hand-sewn details, every piece is slightly different -- and that's part of the fun. Pehoe Shirt, $250, AtelierAndRepairs.com</p><p>30. Book Mark</p><p>For literary types who wouldn't be caught dead with an e-reader, Milan-based artist Clara De Lorenzi offers personalized bookplates, or Ex Libris. Bookplates date to around the 15th century, when the heraldic designs (often reflecting their owner's hobbies -- falconry, anyone?) were used to mark precious manuscripts. Surprise a bibliophile with one of Ms. De Lorenzi's ready-made stamps, or commission a bespoke one tailored to their name and tastes. Extra credit: Give a vintage hardcover to christen it with. Ex Libris Basic Collection 04, from about $31, ClaraDeLorenzi.com</p><p>31. Heavy Necking</p><p>OK, a scarf is not the most surprising gift. Unless, that is, it's so massive it will envelop your giftee's neck and possibly shoulders with regal presence. About 18 inches across and 83 inches long, this blanket-like, mohair-blend design makes most throat-coddlers look flimsy, threadbare and unlikely to earn potential-heirloom status. It's the work of a cool, unisex brand based in Oslo, Norway, where temperatures can fall below zero Fahrenheit and scarf makers don't fool around. Fresia Check Colin Scarf, $200, HolzweilerOslo.com</p><p>32. Bottomless Bottle</p><p>Produced on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the wine of the same name comes as close to immortality as any in the world. Incredibly, even an open bottle of Madeira can be enjoyed for decades. Mannie Berk, founder of Rare Wine Co., has an 1802 Madeira in his cellar that he opened 25 years ago. \"It's still great!\" he reported. This delicious 2001 bottling, rich and warm with luxurious caramel tones, is one for the ages. 2001 D'Oliveiras Boal Madeira, $150, RareWineCo.com</p><p>33. Match Point</p><p>If your giftee is the sort who would have loved clinking Martinis with Manhattan's literati at the late, lamented Elaine's, the Instagram account Matchbook Diaries is a gift in itself. It documents striking strikers, largely from legendary bars and restaurants, collected by photographer Charles Ryan Clarke. Bestow some of that timeless glamour (in a gift you can actually wrap) with a fabulous, framed 8-by-12 or 10-by-12 print of one of Mr. Clarke's matchbook photos. The Original Matchbook Print, $175, CharlesRyanClarke.com</p><p>34. A Long Goodnight</p><p>The children's classic \"Goodnight Moon\" celebrates 75 years of noble bedtime-story service this year. Written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by Clement Hurd, the tale narrates the nighttime ritual of an anthropomorphic bunny as he bids adieu to kittens, mittens and red balloons. This edition's cushiony, midnight-blue leather cover and golden embossed letters, including personalizable name and date, ensures the book an extended shelf life. Leather Bound Goodnight Moon, $69 plus $13 for personalization, MarkAndGraham.com</p><p>35. Circular Thinking</p><p>Want to bequeath sparkle but don't love the thought of taking out a second mortgage? Consider this bracelet, a string of 47, round-cut, lab-grown, white sapphires. Los Angeles label Dorsey, which uses lab-engineered gems more affordable than their mined cousins, is helping to democratize high-wattage jewelry. This design is equally appropriate for flashing at a schmancy holiday party or brightening a dull day at the office. Kate Bracelet, from $250, ShopDorsey.com</p><p>36. Earthy Service</p><p>Haand's three-piece serving set looks as if it were hewn from centuries-old trees. But its burl finish is in fact the glaze on ultra-durable and dishwasher-safe porcelain. Your giftees (and maybe even their progeny) will be able to whip out the 18-inch platter and smaller plates (13-inch and 15-inch) for both special occasions and daily grub for years to come. 3 Piece Serving Platter Set in Burl, $265, Haand.us</p><p>37. A Tool Kit Supreme (Splurge!)</p><p>Your average tool kit is full of uninspiring, factory-made plastic gizmos. This extremely high-end collection -- from Wohngeist, a Swiss furniture, cabinetry and accessories designer -- by contrast, has soul. Each of its 24 instruments, including eight hex keys and a wood-handled chisel, was handcrafted and accorded its own magnetized landing spot in the pear-wood box. Your giftee will appreciate that material for its sturdiness, but also its unmistakable warm, earthy scent. A definitive keeper. Wohngeist 24-Piece Tool Kit, $2,850, MrPorter.com</p><p>38. Cardigan Trick</p><p>When creating this men's sweater, Dan Snyder, the Brooklyn founder of Corridor, said he wanted to \"make the color move.\" Fine yarn in a rainbow of shades connects woolly, soft cream blocks into a psychedelic brick wall. The effect? Bewitching but, thanks to the neutral base, not overwhelmingly bright. Did we mention that this destined-to-be-fought-over knit is super-soft? That's the durable alpaca wool at work. Cloud Cardigan, $395, Corridor, 646-484-5874</p><p>39. A Family Way (Splurge!)</p><p>Planning even the simplest family vacation can be laborious. But a trip with the express purpose of tracing your brood's roots? Rather overwhelming. For a lavish holiday gift to your loved ones, consider outsourcing the whole affair to pros. Kensington Tours, for example, has teamed up with AncestryProGenealogists to provide private guided tours of your ancestors' cities, villages and even homes, based on meticulous research through historical records and archives. Tours, from about $9,000 per person, KensingtonTours.com</p><p>40. A Catcher That's Fly</p><p>Rawlings has been making baseball gloves since the early 20th century, and it filed a 1922 patent for what the company says was the first glove with webbing in the space between the index finger and thumb. This earned its gloves the favor of plenty of famous players, including Mickey Mantle. One of Mantle's gloves from 1960 was purchased at auction by actor Billy Crystal for $239,000 in 1999. This new one, however, with a more refined design, won't cost you more than a Benjamin. Rawlings 12.75-inch Premium Series Glove 2022, $80, DicksSportingGoods.com</p><p>41. Baby Beanie</p><p>Pom-pom beanies often skew kitsch -- think of the red-and-white reindeer hat Kevin McCallister wears in \"Home Alone.\" This cap reads upbeat yet un-costumey, so your little one -- and perhaps, many winters from now, their little ones -- won't tire of it (barring the interference of moths). This robust knit incorporates organic cotton and recycled fibers, but really, we're here for the pom-pom, a kaleidoscopic explosion of a cherry on top. Rainbow Striped Knit Hat, $75, StellaMcCartney.com</p><p>42. Pop Art</p><p>With this highly collectible, accordion-style corkscrew in hand, you are Colette in her salon in the Palais Royal, you are Gerald Murphy entertaining guests on the Riviera. Patented by Frenchman Jules Bart in 1919 and long the quarry of flea-market hunters, the Zig Zag's nickel-plated-steel design provides the leverage necessary to extract a cork with enviable savoir-faire. This model, made from original 1920s molds, keeps the tradition alive. Even the box it comes in is pure retro chic. Zig Zag Corkscrew, $75, WatsonKennedy.com</p><p>43. The Write Frame of Mind</p><p>For almost 100 years, Lamy has been designing precise, beautiful pens in its Heidelberg, Germany, factory. But the company didn't make its first fountain pen until 1966, a sleek utensil crafted from a durable fiberglass resin. The metal body of the Dialog pen, by comparison, is downright chunky. That heft, plus the flash of gold in its nib, will ensure no one watching your giftee sign a check (or maybe an autograph?) confuses it with a Pilot G-2.Dialog Fountain Pen, $399, US-Shop.Lamy.com</p><p>44. Long May It Rain</p><p>Umbrellas get a bad rap, likely because most are flimsy contraptions that invert embarrassingly at a hint of wind. That soggy state of affairs makes the stick umbrella from Certain Standard, with its massive, 46-inch-wide canopy, sturdy fiberglass frame and cork composite handle (easy to grip, even with sweaty fingers) look pretty great. Bonus: If it ever breaks, the company will send your giftee a free replacement. The Large Umbrella, $75, CertainStandard.com</p><p>45. Wrapping Required</p><p>It's silk. It's sleek. It's by a brand that the snobby (and discerning) \"Succession\" characters wear. And it's . . . fairly affordable? Elite Italian label Loro Piana's elegant, floral-print scarf has a timeless look thanks to its Art Deco-inspired print and the fact that we honestly can't fathom a decade during which this would not look fabulous. Your giftee, and possibly her heirs, will be thanking you for this accessory for a long time. Tapestry Neck Scarf, $200, us.LoroPiana.com</p><p>46. Sip Pretty</p><p>To be labeled \"Bottled in Bond,\" a whiskey must be the product of a single distillation season, among other regulations laid out back in 1897. At Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. in Tullahoma, Tenn., general manager and distiller Nicole Austin returned to barrels from fall 2008 to create this bottling, a complex take on the famously smooth profile of George Dickel \"whisky\" (they spell it the Scottish way), with delicious fruit and nut notes and impressive structure. George Dickel Bottled in Bond Fall 2008, Aged 13 Years, $45, GeorgeDickel.com</p><p>47. Sail Like Hemingway (Splurge!)</p><p>A few years ago, actor Matthew Rhys (co-star of \"The Americans\") found a rare Wheeler yacht on eBay. The now-restored boat was built in Brooklyn in 1939, of the same class and era as Ernest Hemingway's beloved Pilar. Mr. Rhys charters this \"piece of Brooklyn history\" for New York harbor cruises, accommodating up to six passengers. Included in the two-hour excursion: snacks (cured meats, cheeses, maybe ceviche) and refreshments (from mojitos to cava), sometimes served by Mr. Rhys himself. $1,900 for a two-hour cruise, May-Oct.; MoveableFeastNY.com</p><p>48. Peel On</p><p>Kitchenware brand Material is waging a determined campaign against throwaway culture, one beautiful, durable item at a time. This stainless steel peeler comes in a bronze finish that gives it the patina of a well-burnished treasure. The sharp, dishwasher-safe blade makes for superlatively smooth peeling. Perhaps the best part: That blade is replaceable, making this a tool that can pass from kitchen to kitchen for years. The Forever Peeler in Bronzed, $28, MaterialKitchen.com</p><p>49. Belt to Last</p><p>You can only give a man socks so many holidays before he writes you off as fatally uninspired. Switch it up with this timeless belt handmade in Paris by leather-goods specialist Laperruque. It asserts itself through handsome contrast stitching rather than an obnoxious logo buckle. Though it's offered in many shades, this caramel calf leather will darken beautifully with wear -- and with a hardy nubuck lining, this cincher should hold up pants far into the future. Formal Belt, about $129, Laperruque.co</p><p>50. Best-Case Scenario</p><p>Few things evoke grandma's trousseau as potently as lace-trimmed linens. The silk organza lace on these pillowcases, however, is subtly patterned, lending a flourish more contemporary than crusty. Adding to their gemlike quality: The pattern is applied to a release of just 100 pieces. Available in crisp white and buttery winter white, the cases are woven of silk and Tencel, a plant-based fabric known for softness and machine-washability. Seraphina With Lace Pillowcase, from $160 each, BellaNotteLinens.com</p><p>---</p><p>WHAT HEIRLOOM MEANS TO ME</p><p>\"In my mom's things, I found medals my grandmother had won for dancing the fox trot at the local ballroom in the English Midlands. They're silver, kind of industrial, from the late 1920s and early '30s, and I wear them as pendants.\"</p><p>-- Lee Broom: London-based furniture and lighting designer, whose book, 'Fashioning Design,' by Rizzoli, published this month.</p><p>\"My dad has a worn, brown leather wallet that a friend gave him the night he left India in the 1960s, the first time he ever got on a plane. (There's an envelope of holy powder in it given to him by a priest.) I want the wallet because it represents the life that he made for us in America.\"</p><p>-- Neha Parikh: CEO of the digital navigation service Waze</p><p>\"My mother passed down her taste, among other things. When I am gone, I hope someone will treasure these things as much as I do: my great grandmother's ostrich-feather-and-tortoise-shell fan; a diamond-eyed leopard pin with a note from my mother; my grandmother's silver serving bowl.\"</p><p>-- Betty Halbreich: Author and founder of the Solutions Department at the iconic New York department store Bergdorf Goodman.</p><p>\"For me, 'heirloom' can come from outside your family, outside your culture, but still be so valuable. Kayanoya -- the 128-year-old Japanese seasoning brand -- is something I am always happy to pass along to friends and family.\"</p><p>-- Jing Gao: Chef, entrepreneur and founder of Fly by Jing, a modern Chinese pantry-staples company</p><p>\"When I moved out, I received an unassuming cabinet we've always called 'the telephone table,' made by my grandpa when the phone book needed a table. It makes any home feel like my family's home -- though it now holds hats, keys and knickknacks, not the Yellow Pages\"</p><p>-- Dieter Bohn: Former executive editor of the Verge, now a director of platforms and ecosystems at Google</p><p>---</p><p>CONTRIBUTORS: Yelena Moroz Alpert, Kyoko Vappaille Harris, Matthew Kronsberg, Nina Molina, Olivia Niland, Lettie Teague, Tyler Watamanuk, Christian L. Wright</p><p>(See accompanying photos -- WSJ Nov. 19, 2022)</p>",
