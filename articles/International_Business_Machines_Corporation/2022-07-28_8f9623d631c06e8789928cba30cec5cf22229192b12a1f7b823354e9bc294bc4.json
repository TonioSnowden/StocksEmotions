  "title": "Senate Passes $280 Billion Chip Bill",
  "text": "<p>The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 would spend $52.7 billion on direct financial assistance for the construction and expansion of semiconductor manufacturing facilities, as well as other programs. It adds $24 billion in tax incentives and other provisions.</p><p>It would also turbocharge federal spending on scientific research, reflecting concerns that without more investment the U.S. might struggle to maintain a technological edge.</p><p>\"It will mean more resilient American supply chains, so we are never so reliant on foreign countries for the critical technologies that we need,\" President Biden, a Democrat and a strong supporter of the bill, said in a statement.</p><p>The bill was approved 64-33, with 17 Republicans joining a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor. The House was set to vote Thursday. It had been expected to pass there, but a deal announced late Wednesday on a Democratic climate, healthcare and tax bill upset Republicans and might undercut GOP House support for the chips bill.</p><p>Opponents of the bill pushed to attach more strings to the funding and questioned the wisdom of a large subsidy to a profitable industry. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) called the package \"one of the grossest gifts to corporate America I've ever seen.\"</p><p>By favoring a particular industry -- in this case semiconductor manufacturing -- the U.S. is practicing the kind of so-called industrial policy it has long avoided. Supporters said the change is needed for the U.S. to stay competitive.</p><p>\"In the 1970s and '80s our companies could do just fine on their own,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in an interview this week. \"But in the 21st century, with countries like China and Germany investing heavily, we could sit back on the sidelines and who would lose out? American workers, American economic dominance and our national security.\"</p><p>Companies that could tap the funding for U.S. expansions include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., GlobalFoundries Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Applied Materials Inc. and more.</p><p>A broad swath of business leaders applauded Wednesday's vote. The bill allocates $39 billion for semiconductor manufacturing, but also includes $11 billion to advance semiconductor manufacturing research and workforce training, and a $2 billion fund to more quickly translate laboratory advances into military and other applications.</p><p>\"Companies that make semiconductors and companies that use semiconductors represent almost the entirety of the corporate ecosystem in America,\" said Jason Oxman, president of the trade group Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Intel, as well as manufacturers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. Vice Chairman Gary Cohn called for the legislation's approval earlier this week. \"We need to protect ourselves first as a country and make sure that we're in the chip manufacturing business,\" he said.</p><p>The Senate passed a version of its bill last year, but movement stalled until February when the House passed its version. The lower chamber added billions of dollars to combat climate change, as well as provisions on immigration and marijuana. Talks then stalled again, with lawmakers hung up for months on which provisions to jettison and which to include.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans, stressing the national security worries of reliance on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Most of the chips aren't made in the U.S.</p><p>Senior Pentagon officials gave briefings on Capitol Hill about national security concerns. White House officials coordinated the efforts of dozens of industry associations, holding sometimes weekly meetings.</p><p>Pressure on lawmakers ramped up in June when manufacturers like Intel and GlobalWafers, a Taiwan-based semiconductor silicon-wafer firm that had made public plans to build in Sherman, Texas, along with others, began saying their U.S. expansion plans hinged on passage.</p><p>At an early June meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room, congressional and administration staffers concluded it was time to narrow the bill's scope, said a White House official who attended.</p><p>Lawmakers stripped the bill of components they disagreed on, resulting in the skinnier Chips Act that dropped much of the House portion unrelated to semiconductors, but kept the research elements that lawmakers say will make the U.S. competitive long term.</p><p>During this week's debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) accused Intel Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger of extorting lawmakers, pointing to the executive's assertion that his and other companies would likely invest in manufacturing facilities in Europe or Asia if the bill doesn't pass this summer.</p><p>\"I worry not only about this bill. I worry about the precedent,\" Mr. Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, said. \"Any company who is prepared to go abroad, who has ignored the needs of the American people, will then say to the Congress, 'Hey, if you want us to stay here, you better give us a handout.' \"</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger, in a recent op-ed he co-wrote with Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley published in The Wall Street Journal, said the legislation is necessary for the U.S. to \"help level the playing field with global competitors.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
