Affordability is a core value for Livability, so we look for places that are growing wages and home values while maintaining an affordable cost of living.</p><p>This year, we focused on midsize cities (generally defined as 500,000 population or smaller) that are attracting big waves of young people. We also added more weight to some of our measures of diversity and inclusion to reflect what millennials are looking for in the cities they choose to call home.
