  "text": "<p>Soaring revenues from cloud services ensured <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-24/ibm-posts-best-sales-growth-in-10-years-on-cloud-demand\">earnings from IBM </a>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bbefb76-177d-492f-8045-5941d115e35f\">Microsoft</a> gave us a positive start to this big earnings week for tech. Now comes the hardware crunch, with both Tesla and Apple struggling with component shortages.</p> <p>The electric vehicle pioneer was first to report on Wednesday evening, warning its factories had been “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29866bf3-5c8c-4c9f-9771-f0a5032f0f0e\">running below capacity</a> for several quarters as [the] supply chain became the main limiting factor”, a trend “likely to continue through 2022”. Its shares are down nearly 9 per cent so far today.</p> <p>Despite the limiting factors, Tesla's volume growth this year should be “comfortably above 50 per cent”, said CEO Elon Musk. Last year, Tesla&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6d68b0-0171-4f24-9076-d778babf6fed\">delivered 936,222 vehicles</a>, an annual gain of 87 per cent.</p> <p>He also pledged the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7639bfb0-a6ac-4ad2-9d46-300f73083809\">most profound software update </a>in history&#xa0;to “solve” full self-driving technology in 2022 — a claim he has made in previous years without success. Lex has been investigating <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05a8b7d6-225d-4db4-aaaf-62e6bd5424ee\">the liability issues</a> when things go wrong, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e1bf926-0e5b-4550-93e3-63d12b6fa6e0\">Alphaville looks at </a>the implications of Musk saying the most important development work at Tesla this year will be on its Optimus robot.</p> <p>Apple's earnings call is after the market close on Thursday. Three months ago, chief executive Tim Cook blamed “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a74d722c-103e-42f0-a62c-9f17b7f72656\">supply constraints</a>” and a crisis in obtaining high-end chips for a $6bn revenue hit, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a2c18b9-4c37-470a-8c01-bec0a2310882\">reports Patrick McGee</a>. Cook added “the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter” — a line interpreted to mean a $10bn-plus hit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48c44813-e5a2-4fe2-a984-8bd4ae2e0ded\">As we reported </a>on Wednesday, the US commerce department has found manufacturers' inventories on average have only five days of chip supplies, as demand increased 17 per cent in 2021 compared to two years earlier.</p> <p>“Apple will very likely still report a monster quarter, blowing past its previous quarterly revenue record set [last year],” says Neil Cybart, independent analyst at Above Avalon who is projecting $127bn in revenue. “However, reported results could have been even stronger.”</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Ocado moves to lighter robots</strong><br>While Tesla focuses on Optimus, grocery logistics company Ocado has unveiled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7545d1e4-4e85-46ff-9908-4f253a775b81\">a range of automation improvements</a> from lighter robots to improved grocery picking. In FT Magazine, John Gapper&#xa0;tells the twisted tale of the battle between Ocado and Norway's&#xa0;AutoStore concerning a remote village, a world-changing invention and the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f12906e-fc6a-403b-aa41-aca03724b76f\">epic legal fight</a>&#xa0;that followed.</p> <p><strong>2. Crypto-kickers' monster mash</strong><br>The safekeepers of crypto assets are attracting billions of dollars from investors, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b95bca4e-545d-4b00-b31a-dfdf6d4f0757\">Fireblocks becoming</a> the highest valued crypto asset custodian on Thursday after raising $550m in a new funding round that puts an $8bn price tag on the company. Meanwhile, we have more on Meta <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e237df96-7cc1-44e5-a92f-96170d34a9bb\">preparing to abandon</a> its Diem crypto project, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0fefc0f-cdea-4ce6-94ab-234d1ece2d8d\">an opinion piece</a> on the UK bringing the promotion of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a8b0285-9003-4c2f-8974-73137f323acd\">crypto assets</a>&#xa0;under the umbrella of financial services regulation, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e7064bd-ec17-419c-a1ee-c28242e32904\">Martin Sandbu on</a> how the main objection to digital currencies is misguided. Finally, the head of Upbit, South Korea's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has promised that its non-fungible tokens featuring K-pop stars BTS will be&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb8c5995-c6d7-43c5-a12e-381901be2a31\">“eco-friendly”</a>&#xa0;after a backlash from environmentally conscious young fans.</p> <p><strong>3. Netflix targeted as tech swoons</strong><br>Pershing Square, Bill Ackman's investment group, has bought 3.1m shares of Netflix in recent days as the hedge fund billionaire&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba5ab83c-3a84-4544-8b7f-3158b358ef69\">seeks to capitalise</a>&#xa0;on a sharp sell-off that has almost halved the streaming company's market value in the past few months (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a7a894-10a9-4505-99b4-f1e1ef7bc4e1\">Blackstone is also on the lookout </a>for tech bargains).<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70f478ab-e48a-464e-ace9-33b86b51e2de\"> Anna Nicolaou says</a> the Netflix sell-off has been unsettling for Hollywood after its own efforts to copy the streaming model, although <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05770d6b-6a01-4884-addd-b5336e7b44cc\">WarnerMedia signed up more</a> US subscribers to HBO Max than Netflix's additions in the fourth quarter.</p> <p><strong>4. Has the appetite for plant-based meat peaked?&#xa0;<br></strong>Consumer interest in plant-based meats surged around the flotation of US start-up Beyond Meat in 2019. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/996330d5-5ffc-4f35-b5f8-a18848433966\">sales growth is falling</a> in the US and the UK. Investment is continuing, with&#xa0;$3bn raised&#xa0;in 2021 — but are products failing to meet taste expectations?</p> <p><strong>5. San Francisco is scaring away the tech crowd&#xa0;<br></strong>As a failure to tackle the&#xa0;epidemic of poverty continues, start-up founders, engineers and venture capitalists are leaving the city. If it wants its tech crown back, it cannot afford to just continue&#xa0;as normal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22925320-fe19-4305-917d-ef4ce3e7e96e\">writes Hannah Murphy.</a></p> <h2>Tech tools — Loftie alarm clock</h2> <p>Dreamt up by a New York start-up, this <a href=\"https://byloftie.com/\">smart alarm clock </a>has a simple raison d'être: it aims to banish your phone from the bedroom while you sleep, <em>writes Jamie Waters.</em> Everything about the $149 Bluetooth-enabled device — which plugs into the wall and is operated via an app or, more sensibly, by pressing its physical buttons — contributes to a soothing ambience. Its forte is its sound. It boasts a multitude of aural&#xa0;functions including a white-noise machine, meditation and breathing exercises, gong-infused sound baths, and other background comforts including chirruping cicadas and a&#xa0;crackling campfire that's sure to get eyelids drooping. Read about it in this round-up of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7eea3ed1-72dc-4e42-a101-c881c70e2c9b\">four gadgets to kick-start your day.</a></p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2022 'Chips are down as Tesla and Apple suffer growth pains' FT.com 27 January.
