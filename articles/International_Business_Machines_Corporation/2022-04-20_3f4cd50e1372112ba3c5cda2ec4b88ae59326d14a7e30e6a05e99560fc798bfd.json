  "title": "U.S. Stocks Waver Ahead of Major Earnings; Netflix plunged more than 30% after the company reported a drop in subscribers",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have had a strong start to the week, lifted by earnings reports that showed companies have largely been able to generate growth despite tightening monetary policy and the highest inflation in four decades. Netflix's report after hours on Tuesday disappointed, while Procter &amp; Gamble reported the biggest jump in sales in two decades, leading investors to closely scrutinize performance in an environment with rising prices.</p><p>\"We are living in a year of higher inflation and that will cause problems for some companies. What we are trying to assess is really the pricing power of a company, and some will see their profitability come under pressure if they don't have this,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble rose nearly 2.7% after it raised its full-year guidance and said demand for its pricier items held up. IBM climbed 6.2% after it reported stronger-than-expected revenue growth driven by its cloud business.</p><p>Netflix shares plunged 36%, on course for its worst day in nearly a decade, after it said its subscriber base shrank by 200,000 in the last quarter and predicted the loss of another 2 million subscribers this quarter. The S&amp;P 500's communications services sector, of which Netflix is a component, was down 3.3%.</p><p>The drop in Netflix's shares would slash around $40 billion of its market capitalization, which stood at $157 billion on Tuesday, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"There is also the secondary effect that economies are reopening. It is really time to shift the portfolio away from the life at home companies,\" Mr. Filip said.</p><p>Tesla and United Airlines are scheduled to post earnings after markets close.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.880% from 2.911% on Tuesday, reversing direction after three consecutive days of rises. The 10-year inflation-linked bond yield, a proxy for a benchmark real rate, briefly turned positive in intraday trading for a second day after spending more than two years in negative territory, reaching a high of 0.035% before easing to minus 0.027%.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with global benchmark Brent crude rising 0.2% to trade at $107.47 a barrel. Traders are assessing China's easing Covid-19 restrictions. Road traffic in major cities such as Beijing and Hong Kong has increased, lifting fuel demand, according to consulting firm Rystad Energy.</p><p>In economic news,U.S. home prices reached a record $375,300 in March as mortgage-interest rates shot up and a shortage of homes for sale continued to thwart buyers.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%. Credit Suisse declined 1.6% after the bank warned that it is likely to report a loss in the first quarter due to having to set money aside for legal issues. French food company Danone rose 6.2% after it beat expectations on sales and reiterated its full-year guidance despite inflationary pressures.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.9%.</p><p>Australian private-hospital operator Ramsay Health Care jumped 24% after a KKR-led consortium offered to buy the company for around $14.9 billion.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Waver Ahead of Major Earnings</p>",
