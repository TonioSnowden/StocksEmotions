Among those worries: A slowdown in China's economy, supply-chain blockages that have hampered sectors such as manufacturing, and inflation pressures.</p><p>Data showed jobless claims fell to a new pandemic low last week, a sign layoffs remain rare. Filings for initial unemployment benefits fell to 290,000 from 296,000 the week before, the Labor Department said. Meanwhile, existing-home sales rebounded in September, rising 7% from the prior month.</p><p>The shared-office company WeWork started trading publicly Thursday, two years after its planned initial public offering imploded.

They could provide a clearer picture of the pandemic recovery than the previous couple of quarters did.</p><p>\"Coming out of the depressed period of Covid and turning everything back on you had this amazing year-over-year comparison that was really easy to accomplish,\" said Kevin Philip, managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors. \"Now the question for a lot of people isâ€¦ will the earnings after this big jump sustain themselves?\"</p><p>Earnings reports will offer clues about consumer spending habits. \"I would not bet against the American consumer,\" Mr. Philip said. \"It's been a terrible bet.\"</p><p>AT&amp;T shares fell 0.6% after the company said it expected full-year earnings to reach the high end of its target. Blackstone shares gained 3% on net income that almost doubled in the third quarter.</p><p>Of the 80 companies on the S&amp;P 500 to have reported through Wednesday, 81% had topped analysts' earnings forecasts, according to FactSet, better than the roughly 75% that did so each quarter in 2019.</p><p>\"We've gone through a period of hesitation that's brought a bit of volatility but I think stocks will keep trending higher,\" said Paul Jackson, head of asset allocation research at Invesco. He expects households to keep spending savings accumulated during the pandemic.</p><p>HP raised its dividend and outlook for the 2022 fiscal year, and shares jumped 6.9%. Tesla added 3.3% after the auto maker said late Wednesday it had notched a third-straight record quarterly profit.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly lower. Shares of China Evergrande Group slumped 13% in Hong Kong after the embattled developer canceled plans to sell a majority stake in its property-management unit, a setback in attempts to ease its continuing cash crisis.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5%, Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.9% and China's Shanghai Composite Index ticked up 0.2%.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.1%, led down by stocks in the basic-resources, auto and industrial sectors.
