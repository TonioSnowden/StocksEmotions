  "text": "<p>(Portfolio, 296 pages, $27)</p><p>Just a few decades ago, professional communication was -- to modern sensibilities -- comically clunky. You could play phone tag all day. Grimy interoffice memo folders fell apart with constant use. Email swept through corporate life because people could suddenly send and read messages whenever they liked. It introduced, according to Georgetown computer-science professor Cal Newport, \"low-friction communication at scale.\"</p><p>Alas, low-friction communication quickly took on a life of its own. As Mr. Newport observes in \"A World Without Email,\" engaging in digital back-and-forth proved useful but created disruptions that made it hard to focus. \"The hyperactive hive mind\" that email (and, to an extent, instant-messaging programs) enabled has been a \"disaster for overall productivity.\" In short, it's time to try something else.</p><p>Mr. Newport offers a surprisingly zippy history of email and notes how suddenly it changed the way workers worked. When IBM brought the new medium to its headquarters in the 1980s, its engineers chose a server that could handle the then-current volume of analog interaction: voicemails, memos, scribbled notes that employees were sending. Within days the company blew through the server's capacity, creating five to six times more traffic than estimated. What would have been person-to-person chats became email chains. What would have involved one person involved many as people learned how to copy others. Mr. Newport quotes an IBM employee: \"Thus -- in a mere week or so -- was gained and blown the potential productivity gain of email.\"</p><p>When people collaborate in person, they tend to banter -- talking back and forth quickly. Mimicking this in email is a recipe for inefficiency, since multiple chains stack up on top of each other. There is no time to focus on any one topic before new messages come in on another. This dynamic feeds on itself when people find themselves sending more messages just to grab someone else's attention. Volume grows; sending and receiving more than 100 business emails a day is not unusual. Many people, Mr. Newport writes, have found that \"their actual productive output gets squeezed into the early morning, or evenings and weekends.\" Meanwhile, \"their workdays devolve into Sisyphean battles against their inboxes.\"</p><p>Even worse, Mr. Newport argues, email makes us miserable. Because our brains have evolved for small-group give and take, failing to respond feels risky and antisocial. \"To your entrenched social circuitry, evolved over millennia of food shortages mitigated through strategic alliances,\" Mr. Newport writes, \"these unanswered messages become the psychological equivalent of ignoring a tribe member who might later prove key to surviving the next drought.\" Anxiety is the result, and it leads, predictably, to half of users checking email and instant-messaging systems such as Slack every six minutes or less (as one 2018 study found).</p><p>About email's flaws, Mr. Newport is persuasive, though less so when it comes to finding an alternative. He profiles a number of small companies that use project boards such as Trello to manage workflow. Such tools aim at \"flipping the script\": that is, \"you decide when to communicate about a project; you don't let the project decide for you.\" Daily short meetings can help teams identify obstacles and keep people accountable without long message chains.</p><p>But even the companies that use these workflow alternatives use email to some degree, especially for dealing with the outside world. That is because, as Mr. Newport concedes, \"there's no debate that email elegantly solves real problems that once made office life really annoying\" -- such as someone finally calling you back the second you start a conversation with someone else. So perhaps a better title for Mr. Newport's book would be \"A World With Less Email.\" With that more modest goal in mind, he has smart recommendations for individuals and organizations, including these:</p><p>1. Using software such as Calendly to schedule meetings will avoid the soul-crushing slew of messages devoted to choosing a time. 2. Creating nonpersonal email addresses for topics, teams or projects can remove the expectation that a particular person is going to respond, removing the sting from delay. 3. Trying to compose shorter emails will allow you to see right away which matters deserve a phone call instead.</p><p>Mr. Newport argues that managers and support staff should view their mission, partly, as protecting employee time for deeper work. Big organizations could employ an \"attention capital ombudsman,\" charged with limiting the internal informational emails that subject employee time to the tragedy of the commons. He says that progressive organizations could even borrow a lesson from old-school industrial companies, which operate with strict protocols over how to assemble a car or fix a piece of machinery. Workflows, he says, \"should not be left to individuals to figure out on their own, as the most effective systems are unlikely to arise naturally.\" Yes, knowledge workers need autonomy over how they do their jobs. But when no one has time to do her job -- which is what checking email every six minutes guarantees -- then managers should step in.</p><p>And if your managers aren't yet on board? Mr. Newport suggests the life-changing habit of partitioning your time into deep work and interactive work. \"An hour dedicated exclusively to a hard project followed by an hour dedicated exclusively to administrative work will produce more total output than if you instead mix these efforts into two hours of fragmented attention.\" Chucking email entirely might be hard, but less drastic habit adjustments, at least, are doable.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Vanderkam is the author of \"Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done.\"</p>",
