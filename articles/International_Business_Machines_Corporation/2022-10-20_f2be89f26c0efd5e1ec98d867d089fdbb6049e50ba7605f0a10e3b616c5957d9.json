  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX was off 27 points, or 0.7%, to 3,668.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA shed 73 points, or 0.3%, to 30,345.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP was off 67 points, or 0.6%, to 10,611.</p><p>All three major indexes have recorded robust gains for the week despite finishing lower on Wednesday. The Dow is up 3.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 3.8%, and the Nasdaq risen 4.8%, leaving all three on track for their best week in more than a month.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>After falling in premarket trade in reaction to a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, stocks recovered some ground after the open as investors cheered stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose to 4.210%, the highest level since July 2008, dragging stocks lower again.</p><p>Christoph Schon, senior director of applied research at Qontigo, said the current correlation between stocks and bonds is really of concern to multi-asset investors.</p><p>\"Stocks and bonds (are) moving in the same direction, which we haven't really had in a very long time,\" said Schon. \"We would see those brief moments when stocks and bonds would fall together. Normally it didn't last more than a few weeks. Now, this has been going on for many months.\"</p><p>\"With yields now rising so much suddenly, instead of a safe haven, Treasuries are becoming really attractive,\" Schon told MarketWatch on Thursday. \"We've seen lots of inflows into exchange traded funds and bond funds because of those rising yields. I think investors are starting to see Treasuries as a real alternative to equity.\"</p><p>See: 'You can be invested in fixed-income again,' bond investors say, even before the Fed stops hiking rates</p><p>Investors received strong earnings reports from AT&amp;T T, International Business Machines IBM, Dow Inc. DOW, United Airlines Holdings UAL and others.</p><p>On the downside, Tesla TSLA shares slumped 7.2% after the electric vehicle maker said Wednesday evening it expects to miss its 2022 deliveries target.

FDX withdrew its guidance and called for much lower profit and revenue, but the companies that have reported so far have managed to outperform these low expectations, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.Reily Wealth.</p><p>\"We had expectations for a disaster in earnings, and that expectation hasn't met reality,\" Hogan said. \"We haven't had a single household name that has disappointed. There hasn't been one standout where you can say 'this is a tell.'\"</p><p>See: Stocks are attempting a bounce as earnings season begins. Here's what it will take for the gains to stick.</p><p>Next week will be one of the busiest for corporate earnings this quarter though as investors will see results from Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOG and Amazon AMZN, among other firms. 165 S&amp;P 500 index companies are expected to report next week, compared with just 66 this week, according to FactSet.</p><p>In U.S. economic data Thursday, investors received a weekly update on the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits.

T were up 0.5% after the telecommunications company topped profit expectations and posted another quarter of sizable subscriber gains.</p><p>* American Airlines Group Inc. AAL shares declined 3.4% despite the company's strong third-quarter results and robust fourth-quarter guidance.</p><p>* Shares of Adidas ADDDF was down 4.6% after the company slashed its full-year outlook and rolled out a \"business improvement program\" which will include initiatives aimed at mitigating \"the significant cost increases resulting from the inflationary pressure across the company's value chain as well as unfavorable currency movements.\" NIKE's NKE shares fell 1.4% following its rival's announcement.</p><p>* Semiconductor stocks SOX surged with Lam Research Corporation LRCX jumping 6.4% and Nvidia Corporation NVDA rising 1.6%.</p><p>â€”Jamie Chisholm contributed reporting</p><p>U.S. stocks reverse gains despite strong earnings, Treasury yields remain elevated</p>",
