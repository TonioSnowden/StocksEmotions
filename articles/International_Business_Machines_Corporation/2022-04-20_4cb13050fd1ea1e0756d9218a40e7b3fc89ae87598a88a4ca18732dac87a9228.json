  "title": "Dow Advances as Investors Look Beyond Netflix Report; Streaming-company's shares plunge more than 30%; Nasdaq loses ground",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have had a strong start to the week, lifted by earnings reports that showed companies have largely been able to generate growth despite tightening monetary policy and the highest inflation in four decades. Netflix's report after hours on Tuesday disappointed, while Procter &amp; Gamble reported its biggest jump in sales in two decades, leading investors to closely scrutinize corporate performance in an environment with rising prices.</p><p>\"We are living in a year of higher inflation and that will cause problems for some companies,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"What we are trying to assess is really the pricing power of a company, and some will see their profitability come under pressure if they don't have this.\"</p><p>The consumer-price index rose 8.5% in March from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace since December 1981. Still, some investors and analysts have said recent economic data contains clues that the surge in inflation may be slowing.</p><p>\"Inflation might remain at high levels, but certainly we might have seen the worst of the year-over-year increases,\" said Carin Pai, head of portfolio management and head of equity strategy at Fiduciary Trust International.</p><p>IBM climbed 7.9% after it reported stronger-than-expected revenue growth driven by its cloud business. Procter &amp; Gamble rose 2.7% after it raised its full-year guidance and said demand for its pricier items held up.</p><p>Netflix shares plunged 36%, on course for its worst day in nearly a decade, after it said its subscriber base shrank by 200,000 in the last quarter and predicted the loss of another 2 million subscribers this quarter. The S&amp;P 500's communications services sector, of which Netflix is a component, was down 3.7%.</p><p>\"It is really time to shift the portfolio away from the life at home companies,\" Mr. Filip said.</p><p>Netflix has lost $57.5 billion in market cap so far Wednesday, bringing its total market cap down to $97 billion. That loss is larger than the bottom seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 combined, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Other streaming companies fell: Paramount dropped about 7.1%, Warner Bros. lost 5.6%, Walt Disney slid 4% and Spotify fell 9.8%.</p><p>\"Netflix results don't necessarily have broader economic or market implications, especially since it is more company-specific,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Mr. Kourkafas said he is focusing on earnings from Procter &amp; Gamble and healthcare-products giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, which reported results Tuesday, to gauge insight into consumer sentiment.</p><p>Among other earnings reports expected Wednesday, Tesla and United Airlines are scheduled to post results after markets close.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.847% from 2.911% on Tuesday, reversing direction after three consecutive days of rises. The 10-year inflation-linked bond yield, a proxy for a benchmark real rate, briefly turned positive in intraday trading for a second day after spending more than two years in negative territory, reaching a high of 0.035% before easing to minus 0.027%.</p><p>Global benchmark Brent crude added 0.1% to trade at $107.39 a barrel. Traders are assessing China's easing Covid-19 restrictions. Road traffic in major cities such as Beijing and Hong Kong has increased, lifting fuel demand, according to consulting firm Rystad Energy.</p><p>Natural gas has also been volatile recently, climbing to $7.81 per million British thermal units on Monday before falling below $7 Wednesday.</p><p>In economic news,U.S. home prices reached a record $375,300 in March as mortgage-interest rates shot up and a shortage of homes for sale continued to thwart buyers. The Federal Reserve in a report said the U.S. economy grew at a modest pace in early spring amid high inflation and geopolitical instability.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%. Credit Suisse declined 1.5% after the bank warned that it is likely to report a loss in the first quarter due to having to set money aside for legal issues. French food company Danone rose 5.8% after it beat expectations on sales and reiterated its full-year guidance despite inflationary pressures.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.9%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Advances as Investors Look Beyond Netflix Report</p>",
