  "text": "<p>Sustained momentum in Microsoft's cloud business \"should help offset impacts of a volatile macro environment and mounting [foreign exchange] headwinds,\" a recent Morgan Stanley report said.</p><p>Microsoft is starting to experience the effects of an ending pandemic-era boom. The Covid-19 outbreak fueled the adoption of cloud services and the sale of computers using its Windows operating system. In the most recent quarter, though, PC shipments suffered their steepest decline in years.</p><p>The strength of the U.S. currency also means Microsoft's sales abroad are less lucrative, prompting last month's profit warning. International Business Machines Corp. last week said its earnings were dented by the dollar's strength. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks U.S. currency performance against other currencies, is up 10% since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Microsoft is among the lengthening list of tech companies pursuing belt tightening amid rising concerns about a recession. It recently imposed a hiring freeze on various parts of the company and laid off a small number of employees.</p><p>Demand for cloud services that boomed during the pandemic is still increasing, though at a more modest pace. Microsoft, during the pandemic, reported several quarters in a row of 50% or more year-over-year sales growth for its Azure platform, the world's No. 2 behind Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud. The pace of growth has moderated in the most recent quarters and analysts expect a slowdown to 43% sales growth in the most recent quarter from the year-earlier period.</p><p>Microsoft's advertising business had also seen strength in the pandemic, though the digital ad-market more broadly has been in turmoil recently. Netflix Inc. this month named Microsoft as a partner to build out its advertising-supported streaming business. Microsoft made $8.5 billion in search advertising sales in fiscal 2021, up more than 10% from the previous year.</p><p>The company also continues to build up its lucrative videogame operation and is trying to secure approvals for its $75 billion deal for Activision Blizzard Inc. This month, Britain's antitrust regulator opened a probe into whether the takeover might reduce competition.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft to Maintain Earnings Growth Through Cloud Strength</p>",
