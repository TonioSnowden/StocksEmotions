  "text": "<p>The Wallenbergs know a thing or two about portfolio diversification. The family's background is Swedish industry. But they also founded EQT, Europe's biggest private equity group. On Monday this revealed plans to <a href=\"https://ir.suse.com/websites/suse/English/9999/pdf-download.html?filename=SUSE_plans_initial_public_offering_Q2_2021_26_April_2021.pdf&amp;lg=en\">list German software group</a> Suse in Frankfurt at a mooted valuation of more than €6bn.</p> <p>It is the latest flurry from EQT, whose own shares have tripled since a 2019 listing, valuing it at more than $30bn. The buyout group recently bought FirstGroup's US bus business while abandoning plans to float Europe's largest veterinary service IVC Evidensia. </p> <p>EQT hopes to raise $500m from a Suse stake sale to pay down debts and fund further growth. </p> <p>Suse's version of open-source operating system Linux allows enterprise software customers to launch and run applications across a variety of hardware. The “written-once, run-anywhere” mantra means greater speed and efficiency for cloud-based applications. Suse's acquisition of Rancher Labs last year advanced the strategy. </p> <p>EQT paid Micro Focus $2.5bn for Suse in 2018, eight times trailing revenues. The struggling UK technology group had bought Suse as part of its takeover of The Attachmate Group in 2014. </p> <p>The acquisition by EQT was initially judged overpriced. That was until IBM acquired market-leading competitor Red Hat the following year for $34bn, a 10 times multiple. </p> <p>Since then, valuations have stretched even further. A peer comparison suggests Suse might fetch an enterprise value of 13 times trailing sales. Some premium should probably be granted for Suse's 98 per cent recurring revenues and 19-month average contract period. </p> <p>Indeed, Germany's TeamViewer, one of the few comparators listed in Europe, is growing similarly and trading at a 17 times multiple. A 15 times multiple for Suse would equate to an enterprise value of almost €7bn ($8.2bn), including €500m or so of net debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>EQT plans to continue growing the business. The public offering should give public investors a way into a relatively obscure tech segment. The mooted price for IVC Evidensia spooked London investors. EQT will hopefully show greater restraint in bringing Suse to the Frankfurt bourse.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice-weekly.
