  "title": "Rates Spur Companies to Unload Pension Liabilities",
  "text": "<p>When rates rise, liabilities for defined-benefit plans -- a type of pension plan that promises fixed amounts to participants -- shrink. The liabilities are based on long-term corporate bond yields and decrease when bond yields rise. Long-term corporate bond yields rose to 4.7% at the end of August, up from 2.76% at the end of 2021 and 2.58% a year ago, according to Mercer LLC, a consulting firm.</p><p>Defined-benefit plans sponsored by S&amp;P 1500 companies were 101% funded as of Aug. 31, up 6 percentage points from the prior-year period, according to Mercer. Discount rates are forecast to keep climbing, which would increase funding levels even more and make it more appealing for companies to shift their obligations.</p><p>Many companies in recent years closed their defined-benefit plans to new entrants and signed them up to defined-contribution plans. Those plans don't guarantee fixed payouts, relieving companies from the pressure to generate certain returns and the costs associated with managing the pensions.</p><p>Companies need to have a fully funded pension plan to transfer it entirely to a third party, a process that usually takes one or two years. They can move a portion of their pension obligations, but that requires a high funding status.</p><p>Finance executives and plan sponsors are preparing to unload their plans now as funding levels are high, advisers said. \"If interest rates level off or decrease, the funded status could fall pretty quickly,\" said Matt McDaniel, a partner at Mercer who advises companies on pension risk transfers. That could limit companies' ability to transfer their plans.</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. this month said it is moving more than 40% of its defined-pension obligations -- about $16 billion -- off its books. The technology company is splitting the liabilities equally between insurers Prudential Financial Inc. and MetLife Inc. in a transaction that closed Sept. 13. The plan was funded at 112% at the end of last year and will remain more than fully funded after the transaction, the company said. IBM declined to comment further.</p><p>Companies transferred $17.1 billion in pension risks during the first six months of the year, up from $8.7 billion during the prior-year period, according to Aon PLC, an insurer that advises on these transfers. The volume of transactions usually picks up during the second half of the year and volumes this year could exceed those in 2021, when companies moved $38 billion in pension obligations to insurers, said Ari Jacobs, a senior partner at Aon.</p><p>Aon is benefiting from higher rates as well, Chief Financial Officer Christa Davies said on a July 29 earnings call. \"Each 100 basis point increase in interest rates [. . .] decreases our pension unfunded liability, which decreases cash contributions to pensions,\" she said, adding Aon took steps to de-risk its liability. This includes freezing and closing plans, Ms. Davies said. The company declined to comment further.</p><p>Pactiv Evergreen Inc., a Lake Forest, Ill.-based packaging company, earlier this month said it was shifting around $660 million -- roughly 40% -- of its U.S. pension liabilities to two subsidiaries of insurer Athene Holding Ltd. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Corp. in August agreed to transfer around $1 billion in U.S. pension liabilities, its fifth transaction of this kind since 2018 to make for a total transfer of roughly $3.3 billion in pension obligations. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Defined-benefit plans typically have investment portfolios that include equities, commodities and real estate holdings. Private-equity assets also can be part of the mix, though less so than for public pensions, which are expected to take hits as the value of these investments is slumping. Recent stock market declines have hurt some defined-benefit pension plans invested in publicly traded equities, Mr. McDaniel said. Across all asset classes, estimated aggregate assets among S&amp;P 1500 companies were $1.79 trillion at the end of August, down from $2.33 trillion a year ago, according to Mercer.</p>",
