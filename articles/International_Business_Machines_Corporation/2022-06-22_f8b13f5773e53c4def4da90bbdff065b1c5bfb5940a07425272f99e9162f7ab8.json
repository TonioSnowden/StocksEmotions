  "text": "<p>   In \"Inflation and the Trump Factor\" (Business World, June 15), Holman Jenkins, Jr. writes, \"It's no exaggeration to say the 1970s inflationary upheaval produced the resurgent '80s and '90s.\" I disagree; the IBM PC was introduced in August 1981. That, and other developments in computing and technology in general, are what fueled the '80s and '90s and thereafter. </p><p>   Allen Kaplan </p><p>   Benicia, Calif. </p><p></p>",
