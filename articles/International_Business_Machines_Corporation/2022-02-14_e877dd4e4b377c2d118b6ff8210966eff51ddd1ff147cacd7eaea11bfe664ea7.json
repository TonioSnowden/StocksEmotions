  "title": "IBM executives called older workers ‘dinobabies' in company emails, according to age discrimination lawsuit",
  "text": "<p>These emails were submitted as evidence in an ageism case that former IBM employees have brought against the company. The lawsuit, which first began in 2018, started after IBM eliminated jobs for more than 20,000 American employees over the age of 40, representing 60% of its total U.S. job cuts during those years, according to ProPublica.</p><p>The executives, who IBM informed MarketWatch are no longer at the company, wanted to make the dinobabies “an extinct species,” the emails read.</p><p>See also: Will ‘unretirement' solve the labor shortage?</p><p>Labor attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan is representing hundreds of former IBM employees in the lawsuit, and alleges IBM executives were aware of a “companywide plan to oust older employees in order to make room for younger employees.”</p><p>One email from a former IBM executive, whose name was redacted from the filing, referred to older employees' perceived lack of understanding of the digital landscape as a danger for the company.</p><p>“This is what must change,” the email reads, per the filing. “They really don't understand social or engagement. Not digital natives. A real threat for us.”</p><p>See also: Welcome to the ‘crypto Super Bowl' with cryptocurrency ads running during the game for the first time</p><p>IBM spokesman Chris Mumma told Insider the company has “never engaged in systemic age discrimination.” He went on to say that “IBM separated employees because of changing business conditions, not because of their age.”&#xa0;</p><p>IBM seemed to acknowledge the validity of the emails, while claiming they do not represent the company's feelings toward its workers.</p><p>“As the data clearly show, the language used does not reflect IBM practices or policies. Between 2010 and 2020, 37 percent of all U.S. hires at IBM were over the age of 40, and during that same period the company hired more than 10,000 people in the U.S. over the age of 50,” an IBM spokesperson wrote to MarketWatch in an email.</p>",
