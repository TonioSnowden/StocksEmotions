  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> the <strong>Premier League</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c055f461-b3f4-44c0-b3d8-8254e17d4e87\">has sold</a> the rights to screen its football matches in the US to <strong>Comcast</strong>'s <strong>NBC</strong> for about $2.7bn over six years, almost tripling the value of its existing contract with the broadcaster and reinforcing its dominance over rival European leagues. </p> <h2>London calling: Leon Black swoops on luxury property</h2> <p>“A blue-plaque Belgravia mansion fit for a prime minister” is how Luxury London magazine <a href=\"https://luxurylondon.co.uk/house/property/93-eaton-square-london-property-for-sale-belgravia-stanley-baldwin-kathleen-duross-ford\">described</a> its July 2021 property of the month, which was once home to <strong>Stanley Baldwin</strong> and <strong>Henry Ford II</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Leon Black </strong>will have to do. </p> <p>The New York billionaire has agreed to buy 93 Eaton Square for £21m, people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e90cbac-edcd-4aba-a925-8782d59b8a1f\">told the FT</a>. </p> <p>Black's London purchase comes after he suffered several reputational blows in his home city of New York. </p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97fdc05b-d3cd-45b7-b155-5f4ab525c59a\">resigned</a> as chief executive of <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> in March following an independent investigation into his ties with the late sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, and stepped down as chair of New York's <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> soon after.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dabdc1c-fad3-4184-b439-8cc785302279\">paid $158m</a> to Epstein over a five-year period ending in 2017, according to a report by the law firm <strong>Dechert</strong>, which the investment group made public in January. </p> <p>The report found no evidence of any wrongdoing or knowledge by Black of allegations that Epstein was running an international sex-trafficking ring.</p> <p>But once a dealmaker, always a dealmaker. The private equity tycoon nabbed the property £2m below its asking price.</p> <p>Previous residents of the exclusive Eaton Square enclave include the composer <strong>Sir Andrew</strong> <strong>Lloyd Weber</strong>, the billionaire investor <strong>George Soros</strong>, <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>'s owner <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> and the James Bond actor <strong>Sir Sean Connery</strong>. Keeping with the 007 theme, the writer <strong>Ian Fleming</strong> even chose Eaton Square as the London residence of his fictional spy hero.</p> <p>(Fans of our property stories might recall that <strong>Sanjeev Gupta </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5956d2-33e0-4ab0-a6d9-76cf63929bd9\">purchased a £42m house</a> in Belgravia last year.)</p> <p>But some real estate agents that spoke to the FT still weren't sold on the area. With a cluster of London homes now going for more than £100m, Black's new property is “not even in the top of the second tier”, said one.</p> <p>“It's a great address but you would need a miner's lamp to live there,” said another of the ground and lower ground floor property.</p> <h2>Reading Unilever's tea leaves</h2> <p>On Thursday <strong>Unilever</strong> announced the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83529b44-f290-4668-a766-5559dfec431c\">€4.5bn sale of its tea division</a> to the private equity firm <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>.</p> <p>The business, now called <strong>Ekaterra</strong>, is home to a stable of recognisable tea brands including the century-old Lipton, and a potentially problematic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea19051f-c603-425e-8b8f-72cc11fe8b3e\">set of social issues</a>. </p> <p>In addition to brands that generate about €2bn of annual revenues, CVC is acquiring three large tea plantations in east Africa, giving the spun-off company direct involvement in an industry with a history of low wages and human rights abuses. </p> <p>Such concerns resulted in a lacklustre auction process at the later stages, including the exit of prospective bidder <strong>Carlyle</strong>.</p> <p>However, executives at Luxembourg-based CVC believe that improving the unit's environmental, social and governance credentials will ultimately help them to sell it on at a profit, said a person familiar with the matter. </p> <p>Ekaterra was “well-positioned to lead the category's sustainable development”, said <strong>Pev Hooper</strong>, a managing partner at <strong>CVC</strong>.</p> <p>Beyond the underwhelming price, there's a broader story of Unilever's underperformance under chief executive <strong>Alan Jope</strong>, who took over in 2019 and vowed to prioritise purpose over profits. He's received a chilly reception from investors, including a 13 per cent decline in Unilever's value this year.</p> <p>The situation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3229ee68-157f-4e1a-abc4-b81ab49b5d79\">could now be ripe</a> for an activist shareholder to swoop in on the ailing conglomerate and its crowded portfolio of brands from <strong>Ben &amp; Jerry's</strong> to<strong> Dove</strong>. </p> <p>Unilever's prized asset, a majority stake in the publicly traded Indian consumer goods division <strong>Hindustan Unilever</strong>, accounts for more than half of its overall value. Meanwhile, investors attribute almost no worth to Unilever's developed markets business.</p> <p>Breaking up conglomerates is en vogue as giants including <strong>General Electric</strong>, <strong>Toshiba</strong>, <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> and <strong>IBM</strong> split and simplify. Separating Unilever's food and soap businesses would undo almost two decades of integration work, but dividing the company by geography might be less disruptive.</p> <p>Jope has laboured for most of his tenure over strategic changes such as Thursday's tea divestiture. Bigger challenges are likely ahead, but with far greater upside potential. Analysts at the brokerage<strong> Exane</strong> recently estimated that if Unilever was valued in line with its peers, it would be worth almost double its current trading price.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Natasha Harrison</strong>, previously named as a successor to the veteran US trial lawyer <strong>David Boies</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4119dc42-7537-47b4-97ae-812589e8dbf2\">plans to quit</a> his firm<strong> Boies Schiller Flexner</strong> to launch a rival London practice.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Tatsufumi Sakai</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Mizuho Financial Group</strong>, will step down after the Japanese megabank suffered multiple system failures this year, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Mizuho-Financial-Group-CEO-Sakai-to-step-down?del_type=3&amp;pub_date=20211119000100&amp;seq_num=1\">as reported by</a> Nikkei Asia.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Willis Towers Watson</strong> has <a href=\"https://investors.willistowerswatson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/willis-towers-watson-announces-changes-respect-board-directors\">overhauled its board</a> following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6471af0-764d-49e7-87a0-dd2a2c110fd9\">collapse</a> of its $30bn merger with <strong>Aon</strong>. <strong>Inga Beale</strong>, <strong>Fumbi Chima</strong>, <strong>Michael Hammond</strong> and <strong>Shelly Swanback </strong>have joined “following a constructive engagement” with the activist hedge fund <strong>Elliott Investment Management</strong>, one of its largest investors. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Dick Weil</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a00b2d3-41c4-45a9-b801-0bb1ba60342b\">will retire</a> as chief executive of <strong>Janus Henderson</strong> in March in an abrupt move as the underperforming $419bn global asset manager comes under pressure from <strong>Trian</strong>, the activist hedge fund run by<strong> Nelson Peltz</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jim Grossman</strong>, chief investment officer of Pennsylvania's<strong> Public School Employees' Retirement System</strong>, is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pennsylvania-pension-cio-jim-grossman-to-resign-amid-federal-probe-11637243641?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">retiring</a> amid a federal investigation into inaccurately reported investment returns, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</strong> has hired <strong>Heather Nyong'o</strong> as a partner in its new San Francisco office.
