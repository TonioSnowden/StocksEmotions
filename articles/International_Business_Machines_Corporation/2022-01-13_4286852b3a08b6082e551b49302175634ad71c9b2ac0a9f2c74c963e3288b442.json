  "text": "<p>Conventionally, drugmakers have taken a one-size-fits-all approach. These days, startups increasingly aim to pinpoint specific groups of patients most likely to respond to a new medicine, based on the presence of a genetic or other biomarker. This could increase the chance of a medication earning regulatory approval and insurance coverage.</p><p>\"If I had to pick the No. 1 thing we see changing, it's the use of biomarkers,\" said Jonathan MacQuitty, life sciences sector head for Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p><p>Biotech startups also are banking on artificial intelligence to uncover new insights. For example, synthetic-biology company Absci Corp., which went public in 2021, has used AI when identifying the function of a protein that wasn't previously known, Chief Executive Sean McClain said. Other biotechs, such as Shape Therapeutics Inc., are applying AI to fields including gene therapy.</p><p>Biotech companies face headwinds this year, including heated competition for talent and supply-chain concerns. Companies that weather these and other challenges can distinguish themselves from weaker competitors this year.</p><p>\"Our sense is 2022 is going to be a strong year, selectively for good companies,\" said Kleanthis Xanthopoulos, CEO of cell-therapy startup Shoreline Biosciences Inc.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Medical-device exits. Venture capitalists cashed in on investments in medical-device startups in 2021, selling and taking a record number of them public.</p><p>Globally, medical-device startups—such as developers of robotic-surgery systems or instruments to treat heart disease—staged 24 IPOs last year, the highest number on record, according to Silicon Valley Bank. Acquirers purchased 22 venture-backed device startups in 2021, also a new high, according to SVB.</p><p>Investors and acquirers are seeking medical devices that could improve medical procedures and enable more patients to be treated or monitored remotely as the Covid-19 pandemic pressures hospitals.</p><p>Strong performance from several medical-device IPOs has encouraged more crossover investors to finance late-stage private companies and prepare them for a public offering, said SVB managing director Jonathan Norris.</p><p>$1 Billion+</p><p>How much startup Dren Bio Inc. could earn through a collaboration with Pfizer Inc. to discover bispecific antibody drugs for cancer.</p><p>Covid-19 Drugmaker to Spend SPAC Funds on Trial, Hiring</p><p>Biopharmaceutical firm Pardes Biosciences Inc. plans to spend a large chunk of the funds it raised through a public offering late last month on a pill it is developing to treat Covid-19, including manufacturing and hiring more clinical staff, WSJ reports. The clinical-stage company on Dec. 27 listed on Nasdaq after merging with FS Development Corp. II, a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by venture-capital firm Foresite Capital. Pardes said it raised $274 million, including $199 million from the SPAC's trust account and $75 million in the form of a private investment in public equity from Foresite, investment manager RA Capital Management and biotech giant Gilead Sciences Inc., among others. Pardes is one of several drugmakers—alongside Pfizer Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Japanese drugmaker Shionogi &amp; Co. Ltd.—that are developing oral antiviral pills against Covid-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month cleared Pfizer's Covid-19 pill for use.</p><p>Other VC News</p><p>China's Startups Attract Record Funding Despite Tech Clampdown</p><p>China is luring record levels of investment into the country's technology sector, even as it clamps down on consumer-technology firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc., WSJ reports. Unlike in previous years, when most Chinese tech funding went to internet startups in e-commerce, the bulk of the money in the past year headed into areas that hew more closely to Communist Party priorities, such as semiconductors, biotech and information technology.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>OSF HealthCare, an Illinois and Michigan hospital system, said its venture arm launched a $100 million third fund to continue focusing on improving patient care and outcomes, and greater operational efficiency.
