  "text": "<p>With <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2536e2fe-6d6c-43ec-a09f-14f239731ea6\"><em>No Time to Die</em></a> grossing $100m in its opening week, Bond still fights on, nearly 60 years since he first hit the big screen. Featuring Mayfair casinos, tarantulas and bikini-clad bombshells on Caribbean beaches, <em>Dr No</em> premiered at the London Pavilion in the autumn of 1962. Resolutely impervious to reality, the film ignored the waning of British colonial power and converted an outdated fantasy of imperial durability into box office gold. </p> <p>Only a few weeks later, a new thriller by an unknown author appeared in the bookshops. Len Deighton's <em>The Ipcress File</em> had a plot that was impossible to follow, and a title that was an impenetrable acronym (short for the “Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex under Stress”). The publishers Hodder had printed about as few copies as they could get away with. Yet its appearance marked a sea change in the cold war spy novel and today the first edition is a collector's item.</p> <p>From the start, the hero — later immortalised on celluloid by Michael Caine — was viewed as a kind of anti-Bond. The film calls him Harry Palmer but Deighton deliberately left him nameless, describing him as “a supercilious, anti-public school technician who thought he was an administrator.” He takes History Today and the New Statesman, reads Fuller's <em>Decisive Battles</em> to relax, does the crossword and — heaven forfend! — he cooks. His clothes are “mass-produced, off-the-peg” and in the film version, he actually wears glasses. </p> <p>Superman was dead, Michael Caine explained to an American interviewer puzzled by this deviation from macho norms: the times belonged to Clark Kent. Thanks to an ice-cold score by John Barry, the plangent notes of John Leach's cimbalom and the moody directing of Sidney Furie, the film version became an iconic expression of 1960s London. Meanwhile Deighton was unleashed: in less than a decade, he published another 10 books, produced two films, and served as travel editor for Playboy. Now in his nineties, he has received the imprimatur of seeing his works included in Penguin Modern Classics. </p> <p>The British were not the first to turn the collapse of empire into literature but they were surely the first to make it entertainment. While Ian Fleming's Bond was a throwback to the adventure yarns of the Edwardian era, younger writers were turning the spy novel into something grittier, more textured and more ambivalent in which the real enemy was not some dastardly foreigner but the bureaucrat across the postwar committee table. If John le Carré was their flag-bearer, Ted Allbeury was their most authentic exponent (with works like <em>The Dangerous Edge</em> that drew on his own wartime experiences), and Eric Ambler — author of the prewar classic <em>The Mask of Dimitrios</em> — their elder statesman. But none of them was as versatile, innovative, funny or curious as Deighton. <em>The Ipcress File</em> marked the beginning of an extraordinary career and the Bond comparisons were soon left behind. </p> <p>Born in a workhouse, Deighton had grown up in a family in domestic service in the middle of London. From his father, a chauffeur, he inherited an admiration for nuts and bolts and the power of technology, and in 1968, his novel <em>Bomber</em> became the first book to be written on a word processor, a 200-pound IBM behemoth that had to be lifted into his living room by crane. His mother was an accomplished cook and Deighton himself was no slouch at the stove: his culinary cartoon strips in the Observer ran for years, thereby contributing to one of the more enduring changes wrought to modern life by the Swinging Sixties — the entry of men into the kitchen. </p> <p>Food is a constant refrain in Deighton's novels. In <em>The Ipcress File</em>, the hero relaxes in the Lebanese hills outside Baalbek, and enjoys the smell of chicken stuffed with nutmeg, thyme, pine nuts, lamb and rice. On Tokwe Atoll, an imaginary American air force base, not even an impending neutron bomb test can spoil the meal: “the vichyssoise was rich with fresh cream, through which the fugitive flavour of leek came through mellow and earthy.”</p> <p>In a postwar Britain still hemmed in by exchange controls and only recently emancipated from rationing, Deighton spoke for a new generation and a new class, one that preferred to seize the opportunities peacetime life offered rather than sitting around lamenting the winds of change. His hero enjoys few things more than riling his boss, “an elegant, languid public school Englishman of a type that can usually reconcile his duty with comfort and luxury.” </p> <p>With national service in the RAF behind him, Deighton went from art school into illustration via a stint as an airline steward before he started writing for fun. He read voraciously and enjoyed living abroad — in France, Portugal, Germany: his second book, <em>Horse under Water</em>, is a passionate hymn to the beauties and tensions of the Algarve at a time when few people in England could tell the difference between Franco and Salazar. </p> <p>But the early Deighton was nothing if not a poet of London as it emerged hesitantly into the charged energy of the 1960s. His hero operates from seedy offices on the wrong side of Oxford Street, an “ancient creaking slum” on Charlotte Street, where the paint is peeling, the plaster is scabbed, and the lino scuffed. Not far away is “the Trat” — Deighton's immortalisation of La Trattoria Terrazza, the famous restaurant that turned the English on to the food of southern Europe — and Led's, “a dark-brown café” near Old Compton Street where the scene is “like Aldermaston March mixing with the Chelsea Arts Ball.” There are other cities too: Paris, New York, Marrakesh and Helsinki, “an urban afterthought where half a million people try to forget that thousand upon thousand square miles of desolation and Arctic wasteland begin only a bus-stop away.” Above all, there is Berlin, the city which in Deighton's later work starts to function as a kind of counterpoint to London. </p> <p>The effervescent spy sequence that made his name ends with the fabulously overblown <em>Billion Dollar Brain</em>: its megalomaniac American millionaire General Midwinter, threatening to unleash a new global conflict with his Facts for Freedom crusade now seems an eerily prophetic figure. After that, Deighton reached back for inspiration into the war of his childhood. </p> <p>Beautifully crafted and astonishingly researched, <em>Bomber</em> is a tapestry of a book that attempts to convey the human cost of the RAF bombing campaign for all sides. Next, two studies of 1940 — <em>Blitzkrieg</em> and <em>Fighter</em> — explored the power of technology in battle. Between them came perhaps his most brooding fiction. <em>SS-GB</em> is a police procedural whose hero is a Scotland Yard detective operating under Himmler's control, in a London now defeated and occupied. Perhaps because the subject tapped into Deighton's own wartime memories, and perhaps too because the action is necessarily circumscribed without the mad dashes and inexplicable journeys of the early fiction, its claustrophobic sinister atmosphere lingers in the imagination. </p> <p>In time, the authorial ambitions deepened. His hero's entanglements with the opposite sex, at first about as perfunctory as Bond's, become more complex and by the <em>Game, Set &amp; Match</em> trilogy it is clear that marriage and its secrets are what really interest him: espionage has become a vehicle for exploring the possibilities for deception and self-delusion in intimacy. Over two decades, the sarcasm and wit-fuelled abrasiveness give way to a more elegiac tone. But what remains constant is Deighton's delight in the play of words and an absurdist's interest in imperfect understanding and miscommunication in an era of shifting identities. We wrestle with the burdens history imposes on us. In the meantime, let us make sure our ingredients are fresh, enjoy the bounty of the world and try — while we get the job done — not to take ourselves too seriously.</p> <p><em>Len Deighton's books are now available as </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241505429/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0241505429&amp;linkId=3cdf065971a09c52f1a9c9a3b4a4258a\"><em>Penguin Modern Classics</em></a><em>.
