  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 were down 4.3 points, or 0.1%, at 3,703.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 rose 46 points, or 0.2%, to 30,506.</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 eased 33 points, or 0.3% to 11,119.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 100 points, or 0.33%, to 30424, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 25 points, or 0.67%, to 3695, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 92 points, or 0.85%, to 10681. Although all three major U.S. indexes remain higher for the week.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP is up 3.8% from its 2022 closing low but remains down 31.7% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Benchmark U.S. bond yields climbed to fresh 14-year highs overnight, which added to the pressure on stocks as investors worried that rising borrowing costs would weigh on corporate earnings while also clobbering the economy.</p><p>Still, stock index futures were choppy in premarket trade, mirroring volatility in bond yields.</p><p>In the U.K., Prime Minister Liz Truss announced plans to resign as soon as a new Conservative Party leader can be selected to take her place. The British pound GBPUSD, which has been extremely volatile this year, pared its gains after Truss's announcement, recently trading up 0.4% at $1.13.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 4.9 basis points to 4.167% after touching its highest since late 2007 earlier.</p><p>Movements in bond yields continued to drive trading in stocks, market strategists said.</p><p>\"Everything you're seeing in stocks is a derivative of what's happening in 10-year yields, and Truss is just a distraction,\" said Richard Farr, chief market strategist at Merion Capital Group.</p><p>Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, noted that the equity rally at the start of the week had petered out \"with Treasury yields hitting multi-year highs as investors turned their focus back to central banks and how fast they'll hike rates\".</p><p>He also blamed surprisingly high inflation readings in the U.K. and Canada for impacting global stocks.</p><p>\"All the big central banks are deciding policy over the next couple of weeks, so it's not surprising that's happening, but sentiment wasn't helped either by further inflation surprises from the U.K. and Canada for September, which echoed what we'd already seen from the US last week, and added to the sense that the hiking cycle will be extended,\" Reid added.</p><p>Confirming such concerns were statements this week from Federal Reserve officials, notably Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who reiterated the central bank may need to push its benchmark policy rate above 4.75% if underlying inflation does not stop rising. Markets are currently pricing in Fed funds rates of 5% by May next year.</p><p>Equity investors looking for a silver lining could at least gain succor from mixed but mostly well-received corporate earnings reports, noted Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.</p><p>\"The third quarter earnings season is beginning to pick up speed in the U.S., and so far the news has been marginally positive. After the bell, the releases continued the theme, with gains for IBM offset by share declines for Tesla and Alcoa,\" Hunter said.</p><p>One notable exception was Tesla, whose shares TSLA were down more than 6% in premarket trading after the company reported a massive year-over-year jump in quarterly profits, but still fell short of Wall Street expectations.</p><p>IBM's stock IBM was up 3%, though tech elsewhere was struggling after Ericsson's FI:ERIBR profits missed expectations and the shares fell 14%.</p><p>\"For now, corporate America seems to be standing up well to the inflation storm, but a lot will depend on the big tech companies reporting next week â€“ with the destiny of the markets in the hands of the likes of Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOG and Amazon AMZN,\" said Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director.</p><p>Investors received a weekly update on the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits on Thursday. The data showednew applications for benefits fell by 12,000 in mid-October to a three-week low of 214,000, as more people who couldn't work after Hurricane Ian returned to their jobs.</p><p>October Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for October remained in contraction territory, with a reading of -8.7, lower than expectations for -5. That's compared with -9.9 last month.</p><p>September existing home sales and also leading economic indicators will be published at 10 a.m.</p><p>U.S. stocks set to open lower as Treasury yields hit fresh 14-year highs; Tesla tumbles after earnings</p>",
