  "title": "National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Resigns in Wake of Sexual Misconduct Scandal; The women's professional soccer league was roiled by publication of sexual misconduct allegations against a coach.",
  "text": "<p>The controversy exploded on Thursday with a report in The Athletic, alleging abusive and controlling behavior by coach Paul Riley, including sexual coercion, at the Portland Thorns. The North Carolina Courage, his current employer, fired him on Thursday. Riley told The Athletic that the majority of allegations against him were untrue, and denied having sex with his players.</p><p>The Athletic reported Baird's departure Friday, and said that it had been sought by the league's board of directors. The board is made up of team owners including ones whose teams have been directly involved in the recent reports of problems.</p><p>Earlier Friday, the NWSL confirmed that the weekend's matches would not take place, \"given the gravity of the events of the last week.\" It said that the decision had been made in agreement with the players association. Its statement did not characterize whether the games would be treated as a postponement or a cancellation.</p><p>\"This week, and much of this season, has been incredibly traumatic for our players and staff, and I take full responsibility for the role I have played,\" said Baird, who took over as NWSL commissioner in March 2020.</p><p>\"I am so sorry for the pain so many are feeling. Recognizing that trauma, we have decided not to take the field this weekend to give everyone some space to reflect. Business as usual isn't our concern right now.\"</p><p>The players association spoke later on the games being halted, saying that after a \"profoundly painful day\" on Thursday, they had asked the NWSL for a postponement \"to give players space to process this pain\" and that the commissioner and board of governors had worked overnight to grant the request.</p><p>\"We know that many of our fans made travel plans, scheduled the night off, or juggled family commitments to attend our games and that this decision impacts you, too. We hope that fans will understand and support us through this time. This is far from over for any of us,\" the association said in a statement.</p><p>Star players including Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan had taken to Twitter to criticize the league's lack of earlier action in the Riley case, and also pointed to endemic abuse in earlier iterations of professional women's soccer leagues.</p><p>\"The league was informed of these allegations multiple times,\" wrote Morgan, who played under Riley at Portland several years ago. \"The league must accept responsibility for a process that failed to protect its own players from this abuse.\"</p><p>Morgan was not the primary focus of The Athletic story, which included detailed allegations from retired player Sinead Farrelly, of multiple incidents in which she felt coerced into having sex with her coach.</p><p>But Morgan on Thursday posted emails with Baird from earlier this year in which Morgan said she had raised concerns during a 2015 investigation by the Thorns into Riley, which she said were not looked into.</p><p>Riley was announced in early 2016 as the head coach of the franchise that became the North Carolina Courage.</p><p>Baird and the NWSL had said on Thursday they had referred the report about Riley's to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, which investigates allegations of sexual misconduct in amateur sports â€” including members of amateur sports bodies who also work in professional leagues. The NWSL requires coaches to have a license from U.S. Soccer.</p><p>On Friday, the Center's searchable database listed Riley as having received a temporary suspension from U.S. Soccer due to \"allegations of misconduct.\" U.S. Soccer, which helped found the NWSL, said on Friday it would hire an investigator to examine the allegations in The Athletic.</p><p>North Carolina was due to play the Washington Spirit on Friday night, along with another match between Racing Louisville and Gotham FC. The other six teams in the league were set to play Saturday night.</p><p>Baird had spent nearly a decade as chief marketing officer of the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee after holding executive positions in marketing at IBM and GM.</p><p>During her time as commissioner, she landed league sponsorships from Ally, Nationwide and MasterCard, and guided the NWSL to a month-long tournament in a Covid-prevention \"bubble\" in Utah, making it the first North American pro sports league to come back after the shutdown.</p><p>Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Resigns in Wake of Sexual Misconduct Scandal</p>",
