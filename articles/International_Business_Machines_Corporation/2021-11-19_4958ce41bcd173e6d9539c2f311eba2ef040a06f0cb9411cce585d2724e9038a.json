  "text": "<p>The outcome represents a win for all the companies, but particularly for Amazon, which lost the competition for the original JEDI contract to Microsoft in a surprise outcome. Amazon later complained in court that the original award to Microsoft was the result of political meddling by then-President Donald Trump, a charge the Pentagon denied.</p><p>The Pentagon eventually canceled the JEDI project (short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) and said it would start over with a new project called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. It has said the new project likely would be a multibillion-dollar procurement.</p><p>The Pentagon didn't immediately say why IBM Corp., which had been viewed as another possible participant, wasn't included.</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon, Google and Oracle didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The original JEDI contract, which was valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, was designed to allow the Pentagon to consolidate its current patchwork of data systems. The aim was to give defense personnel better access to real-time information and put the Defense Department on a stronger footing to develop artificial-intelligence capabilities that are seen as vital to military operations in the future.</p><p>A rebooting of the JEDI project this year became increasingly likely after a federal judge in April refused the Pentagon's motion to dismiss much of Amazon's bid-protest case, a decision that promised to extend the litigation for months or even years. The Pentagon finally pulled the plug on the original JEDI procurement in July.</p><p>Before the Amazon court fight, Oracle—one of the original bidders—also had sued to halt the contract awarding process. Its 2019 lawsuit claimed that an Amazon employee who worked for the Pentagon in 2016 and 2017 helped steer the procurement process to favor Amazon, which then hired him back.</p><p>A judge subsequently rejected those allegations, allowing the bidding process to move forward. Amazon has long maintained that it received no favorable treatment from the Pentagon at any point.</p><p>Infighting over the JEDI contract wasn't the only factor at work in its rebooting this year. Some lawmakers and government-contracting experts also had contended that JEDI's original single-vendor approach should be scuttled because it was inappropriate and outmoded for mammoth enterprises like the Defense Department.</p><p>These people said the Pentagon should move to an increasingly popular approach to enterprise cloud-computing that includes multiple companies as participants. Spreading out the work also reduces the risk of legal challenges from excluded companies, they said.</p><p>The Pentagon's move to seek bids from four big companies appeared to move the agency closer to adopting a multivendor approach.</p><p>Write to John D.
