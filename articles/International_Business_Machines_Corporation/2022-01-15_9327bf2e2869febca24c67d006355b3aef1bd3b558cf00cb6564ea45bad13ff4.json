  "title": "Everybody on Martha's Vineyard Knows the Mercedes Called 'Big Blue'; The 1979 Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL stands out not just because it's a classic; it represents the work one family has done for the Black community on the island and beyond",
  "text": "<p>He and his wife, Bennie, have been coming to their summer vacation home on Martha's Vineyard since the '80s. They've become an institution unto themselves because of the work they do. My mother-in-law opened the first Black-owned toy store on Martha's Vineyard, in the '90s.</p><p>The most reliable car they have there is \"Big Blue.\" My father-in-law would always see this guy driving this big blue Benz around the island. Whenever he ran into him, Flash would say, \"Hey, man, whenever you're ready to sell that car let me know. I'll be first in line.\" One day around 2003, the guy said he would sell it, and they agreed on a price of $5,500.</p><p>Unfortunately, Flash had his third stroke in July, and he said, \"Look, I'm not in condition to drive anymore, but I trust you and my daughter.\" Along with my brother-in-law, Pratt, my wife, B.J., and I have been the main custodians. When B.J. and I started dating, I would drive us around in it, and I really took a liking to it.</p><p>Martha's Vineyard is a very self-contained island. You have to do all these chores: make shopping trips and run to the town dump every few days. So it's become a workhorse car.</p><p>It has these big bench seats in the back. We load five big black trash bags on the back seat and white recycling bags in the trunk. We pay for the trash we unload, then we usually visit Espresso Love, a famous coffee place on the Vineyard. We put a mobile order in, and they always look for Big Blue coming around the corner. Many times the staff will run to the front and wave. Sometimes they'll walk out with our order. People look at us like, \"Who the hell are these celebrities in this big blue car?\"</p><p>Back in '79 you had no cup holders. Of course, you had a cigarette lighter and ashtray, but no cup holders. But the floorboards are almost completely flat, so when my wife and I go to pick up coffee, we put the coffee on the floor. Even though there's no support, the car rides so smooth, not once has it fallen over. To me, that's the ultimate engineering test.</p><p>We've become known around the island because we stand outâ€”young Black folks driving around in a 1979 Mercedes-Benz in damn-good condition. We've had it for around 20 years so people recognize it as more than just a nice car that's well-maintained; it represents the work the family has done in Boston, and also on Martha's Vineyard, for the Black community.</p><p>When I'm driving it I feel like I'm carrying the responsibility of all the work he's done. I feel pride that he gave me the keys. Whenever I come back from a trip out, I say, \"We took good care of your baby,\" and he gets this big smile on his face, and says, \"I'm so happy you're enjoying the car the way I enjoyed it when I was driving.\"</p><p>Write to My Ride at myride@wsj.com</p><p>Everybody on Martha's Vineyard Knows the Mercedes Called 'Big Blue'</p>",
