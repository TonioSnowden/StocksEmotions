  "text": "<p>\"It will be challenging to avoid a recession,\" said Anthony Capuano, CEO of hotel giant Marriott International. \"The chorus of voices saying we're careening towards a recession are getting louder by the minute. Time will tell, but it certainly seems we're headed in that direction.\"</p><p>Others are more sanguine. \"I see something mild,\" said Arvind Krishna, chief executive of International Business Machines Corp. He is, though, seeing more caution and careful evaluation of decision-making among his business contacts.</p><p>Many executives are managing as if there will be a downturn. Stephen P. MacMillan, chief executive of medical technology company Hologic Inc., said he is being cautious about major new investments and scrutinizing any additional hiring.</p><p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. CEO Antonio Neri said he wasn't too worried about the economy this year, either, for now. Should things turn south in 2023, the company will make more targeted investments. He said the strategy would include freeing up capital and reinvesting it strategically, rather than simply cutting costs.</p><p>The U.S. job market, meanwhile, remains strong, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at payroll processor Automatic Data Processing.</p>",
