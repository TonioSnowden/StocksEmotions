  "text": "<p>Several obituaries of the “lateral thinker” Edward de Bono, including that in the FT (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfc65c61-2c86-4844-89b9-ea22a3c0950a\">FT Weekend</a>, June 12), have managed to suggest both that his ideas weren't quite as original as he said they were and that he was a tad more interested in commercial success than was seemly for an “intellectual”. I would like to offer a corrective. In March 1994, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation published a paper by de Bono, called “The IBM Dollar”. It was genuinely innovative — presaging, 25 years ahead of time, private currencies (in his case, issued by what he saw as the most rock-solid company in the western world), initial coin offerings and digital cash more generally. It is still available through the CSFI's website. He offered it to us (we were just starting out) completely free of charge, and launched it at a CSFI round-table. In my opinion, a gent — and a generous one.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Hilton</strong><br><em>Director, Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, London EC3, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: An act of generosity from an original thinker' FT.com 18 June.
