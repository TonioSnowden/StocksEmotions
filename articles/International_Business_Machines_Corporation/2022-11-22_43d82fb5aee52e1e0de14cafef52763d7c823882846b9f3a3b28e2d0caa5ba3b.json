  "title": "New Mexico Pledges $100 Million to Back First Vehicle of America's Frontier Fund; The state's commitment anchors AFF's first fund to back companies in industries strategically important to the U.S., among them, microelectronics, chip manufacturing, AI and others",
  "text": "<p>The newly formed nonprofit's inaugural fund will invest in \"frontier technologies\" considered \"vital to the long-term economic prosperity and national security\" of the country, according to a council staff report. Target sectors include microelectronics and semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, new energy sources, synthetic biology and quantum sciences.</p><p>The fund's first investment will be constructing Roadrunner Studios in Albuquerque, N.M., as a for-profit venture complex to link technology, talent and capital with local businesses, according to the staff report. Roadrunner will also \"serve as the hub of a nationwide virtual Silicon Valley\" connecting other U.S. scientific and business centers, said Gilman Louie, America's Frontier Fund co-founder and chief executive, in a presentation at the council's meeting Tuesday.</p><p>AFF considers New Mexico \"well-positioned to become a leading regional center of excellence for frontier technology due to its federal labs, universities, entrepreneurial network and skilled workforce,\" the staff report said.</p><p>The firm aims to raise $500 million for the new fund and expects to hold a first close in next year's second quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. About two-thirds of commitments to the pool are expected to come from public investors such as the New Mexico sovereign fund, with the rest from private investors.</p><p>AFF and its new fund have drawn high-profile backers. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Eric Schmidt, former chief executive officer of Google, have supported the firm. AFF's board members include Sam Palmisano, former CEO of International Business Machines Corp., while Mr. Louie is a former chief of In-Q-Tel, an investment firm backed by the Central Intelligence Agency to develop technologies that serve national security.</p><p>The firm aims to use Frontier Fund I to back around 40 companies, mainly by acquiring majority positions, the people said. Frontier charges a 2% management fee while 100% of fund carried interest, or the manager's share of investment profits, will go to AFF rather than any of the general partners involved.</p><p>For its part, the New Mexico council has been looking to increase its exposure to early-stage businesses ever since a review of its investments in November 2019, Chris Cassidy, the council's director of private equity, said during the meeting.</p><p>Another goal the council has pursued is to invest with major venture-capital firms that can help New Mexico startups mature, in turn growing the universe of companies in which later-stage fund managers based in the state can invest.</p><p>The sovereign-wealth fund has a program through which it invests in New Mexico-focused managers. These managers \"love the opportunities they are seeing, but they ideally want to see more,\" Mr. Cassidy said.</p><p>New Mexico is home to several tech research hubs, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of New Mexico. Yet the state received just $131 million of venture capital funding last year out of $280 billion spent nationally, according to AFF figures.</p><p>Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CIO Network summit in September, Edlyn Levine, a co-founder and chief science officer of America's Frontier Fund, said a key priority for the U.S. is building a robust domestic chip-manufacturing industry.</p><p>\"Two guys in a garage is great,\" but scaling that idea into a business requires access to multibillion-dollar facilities, she said.</p><p>Write to Rod James at rod.james@wsj.com</p><p>New Mexico Pledges $100 Million to Back First Vehicle of America's Frontier Fund</p>",
