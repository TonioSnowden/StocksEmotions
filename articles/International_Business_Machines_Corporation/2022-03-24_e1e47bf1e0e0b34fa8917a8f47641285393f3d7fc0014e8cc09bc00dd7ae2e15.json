  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Fintech Specialist's  New Fund Raises  Cap to $2 Billion  ----  By Preeti Singh",
  "text": "<p>   Investors in Motive Partners' latest fund have approved raising the vehicle's upper limit to $2 billion ahead of its expected closing in the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The New York-based firm, which is partly owned by Apollo Global Management Inc. and Capital Constellation Inc., had set a $1.5 billion cap for the fund, the people said. When it began marketing the vehicle, Motive aimed to raise at least $1 billion, they said. </p><p>   \"They're raising the [hard] cap in response to the scale, velocity and quality of deal flow and they've routinely accessed co-investment capital for the same reasons,\" a Motive fund investor said. </p><p>   Deals by private-equity firms involving U.S. technology businesses totaled $411.16 billion last year, according to data provider Dealogic, or more than twice the $196.88 billion total for similar transactions in 2020. </p><p>   If the financial-technology specialist reaches its new target, its latest fund would be more than four times the size of its debut Motive Capital Fund I, which wrapped up with more than $473 million in 2019. Last August, Motive said in a regulatory filing it had more than $1.78 billion of assets under management. </p><p>   Motive was founded in 2016 by Managing Partner Rob Heyvaert, who started his first company, Cimad Consultants, at age 24 and built its capital-markets settlement engine before selling the business to International Business Machines Corp. He later started another financial services business that was also sold and has led the formation of two blank-check companies. </p><p>   Motive takes majority and minority stakes in North America- and Europe-based software, information and investment services companies that provide services to banking and payments, capital markets, data and analytics, investment management and insurance businesses. </p><p>   Last July, Apollo acquired a nearly 25% stake in Motive and said it planned to become an investor in Motive funds, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The deal provided Capital Constellation, which backed Motive in 2018, with a partial exit. </p><p></p>",
