  "text": "<p>   Huawei, which denied any involvement with espionage, said it was a Chinese success story whose founder was motivated not by rivalry with America but admiration for it. </p><p>   Mr. Ren, a former army engineer, started out in 1987 selling telecom switches from an apartment in Shenzhen, China. In his telling, a 1993 Greyhound bus trip across the U.S. stirred grand ambitions. </p><p>   In Dallas, Mr. Ren recalled visiting the 60,000-acre headquarters of Texas Instruments Inc. for a daylong tour. He hired a taxi to drive around the Silicon Valley research facility of International Business Machines Corp. so he could calculate how many square kilometers it encompassed. </p><p>   A quarter-century later, his company had a smartphone brand that sold more units than Apple Inc. </p><p>   As Huawei grew, it was stalked by allegations -- from former employees, rivals and U.S. officials -- that its advance relied on deceit. The company denied any wrongdoing. It settled lawsuits with competitors that accused it of stealing trade secrets, among them Cisco Systems Inc. and Quintel Technology Ltd. </p><p>   Paperwork for search warrants and interview notes piled up in a Justice Department office in New York. Some companies were afraid China would retaliate if they took Huawei to court, feeding a view at the department that Huawei's competitive advantage was impunity. </p><p>   HSBC ended up providing investigators with evidence for the Justice Department's first case, which originated in the Brooklyn, N.Y., office. </p><p>   Prosecutors in April 2017 served Huawei with a subpoena to answer questions about whether it conducted business in sanctioned countries, and company executives halted travel to the U.S. </p><p>   In August 2018, prosecutors readied an indictment against Huawei and Ms. Meng. They kept it under seal until she landed in a country within their reach. </p><p>   U.S. officials had hoped Canada would keep Ms. Meng behind bars until her extradition. The billionaire's daughter was a flight risk, prosecutors argued during her December 2018 bail hearing. </p><p>   Instead, a judge granted her bail, set at 10 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to $7.5 million, and imposed a curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Otherwise, she was free to roam. </p><p>   Ms. Meng resided in a $12.3 million, seven-bedroom villa, one of two homes she owned in the city. She had daily Zumba classes and yoga workouts. Personal chefs prepared meals. A florist arranged bouquets for the dining table. </p><p>   On March 6, 2019, three months after her arrest, bodyguards and TV cameras followed Ms. Meng into court for her extradition hearing. </p><p>   On the courthouse steps, protesters opposing Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong set fire to a Chinese flag. </p><p>   The court hearing lasted just a few minutes, marking the start of a protracted legal battle. Each time Ms. Meng went to court, she passed a Chinese nurse holding pictures of Messrs. Kovrig and Spavor to protest their detention. </p><p>   In the northeastern city of Dandong, on the North Korea border, Michael Spavor lived with some 20 other inmates in Cell 315. At night, they slept side by side like sardines. It was sweltering on hot days and cold after dark. Meals were meager and unchanging: cabbage, eggs and rice. </p><p>   Mr. Spavor, a Calgary native, traveled to South Korea at age 21 and taught English. He became fascinated with the authoritarian state of North Korea and began arranging tours. In 2013 and 2014, he planned three trips for Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls basketball star who had his own interest in the secretive country and its leader, Kim Jong Un. </p><p>   Mr. Kovrig had gone to Budapest after college in the mid-1990s, joining a wave of Westerners who flooded into once-closed Central European countries. He worked as a reporter and sang in a punk band before joining Canada's diplomatic service. </p><p>   Fluorescent lights glowed 24 hours a day in Mr. Kovrig's windowless cell at Beijing's No. 1 Detention Center. For almost six months, he was confined without a whiff of fresh air. He devised a daily workout of push-ups, six-minute planks and 7,000 steps. </p><p>   Prison authorities spent the first months of Mr. Kovrig's incarceration conducting interrogations that stretched to 10 hours. Over and over, they questioned his work at the Canadian embassy in Beijing. </p><p>   In June 2019, after more than 150 days in prison, Mr. Kovrig was allowed to send a batch of letters home. The embassy sent copies to his wife in Toronto. </p><p>   Vina Nadjibulla, a 44-year-old international security analyst, met Mr. Kovrig while they were studying international relations at Columbia University in 2001. The couple had separated by the time of Mr. Kovrig's arrest, but Ms. Nadjibulla put her life on hold, flying between Toronto, Washington and Ottawa to petition officials who could help free Mr. Kovrig. In June, Mr. Trudeau invited Ms. Nadjibulla to his office, and she read from her husband's letters. </p><p>   \"If there is one faint silver lining to this hell, it's this: trauma carved caverns of psychological pain through my mind,\" one letter said. \"I find myself filling those gulfs with a love for you and for life that is vast, deep and more profound and comforting than what I've ever experienced.\" </p><p>   About a week later, Mr. Trudeau arrived in Osaka, Japan, for the G-20 summit. He set out to lobby the one person who could release his two countrymen -- Mr. Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. </p><p>   In meetings with Western leaders, Mr. Xi seldom joked and rarely smiled. He usually began with a monologue of talking points almost identical to his public statements. He so resolutely stuck to scripted remarks that his interpreter simply read aloud from a prepared English text. When finished, Mr. Xi would ask, \"Don't you agree?\" </p><p>   Through the first half of 2019, Mr. Trudeau had failed to get an audience with Mr. Xi. The Chinese reply to Mr. Trudeau was frustrating: It would breach protocol for Mr. Xi, a head of state, to speak with Mr. Trudeau, merely the head of government of Canada, whose head of state was Queen Elizabeth II. </p><p>   Beijing expressed itself through trade restrictions. China blocked shipments of Canadian canola oil at its ports. In May, it barred pork from two of Canada's top slaughterhouses. Three days ahead of the G-20 summit, it stopped all Canadian meat from entering China. </p><p>   Mr. Trudeau asked Mr. Trump to speak up for Messrs. Kovrig and Spavor when the U.S. president met with the Chinese leader at the summit. </p><p>   In their meeting, Mr. Trump handed Mr. Xi a sheet of paper that listed the names of Americans being held in China. The names, written in Chinese and English, also included Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. </p><p>   \"It would be a great gesture,\" Mr. Trump said with a stroke of flattery, if China could help these people get home. </p><p>   Scanning the names, Mr. Xi pointedly noted that the last time the two leaders had met was the day of Ms. Meng's arrest. </p><p>   Mr. Trudeau got his opening by chance. Chile was a guest at the G-20 meeting, but its representative didn't attend a scheduled assembly. That left Canada seated alphabetically between China and Brazil -- Mr. Xi next to Mr. Trudeau. </p><p>   The Canadian prime minister passed a note, handwritten in Chinese, to Mr. Xi. \"We have to communicate,\" it said. Mr. Trudeau proposed they select two confidants to begin backchannel talks. </p><p>   The two men stepped to the side of a conference floor, exchanged pleasantries through a translator and clasped hands. </p><p>   Days later, Dominic Barton, the former global managing partner of consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., carried a folder into a gated state guesthouse in Beijing. His meeting was unofficial and secret. He told his secretary he was on vacation. </p><p>   The 60-year-old Canadian had risen in the slipstream of China's economic miracle, and through more than a decade living and working in the country had ties with Chinese entrepreneurs, executives and party leaders. </p><p>   Mr. Barton wasn't a diplomat. Yet Mr. Trudeau believed he could break the diplomatic logjam and bring home the two Michaels. </p><p>   The silver-haired executive smiled at a pair of Foreign Ministry officials when he entered his first meeting. A Communist Party official began reading from a stack of pages, pausing with dramatic effect for the translator to catch up. </p><p>   \"You have arrested Madam Meng.\" </p><p>   \"You are lapdogs of the United States.\" </p><p>   Mr. Barton interrupted, and the ministry official, appointed by Mr. Xi, looked up and flipped back to the first page. Then he began rereading from the beginning. For three hours, the official read from an invective-laced script, circling back to the top each time Mr. Barton protested. </p><p>   Mr. Barton held his tongue through the last hour of hectoring. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Barton asked if China's Foreign Ministry would attend a second meeting in Ottawa. No, the official said. But the Canadians were welcome to return to Beijing. </p><p>   That was the only good news Mr. Barton had for the prime minister. </p><p>   \"OK,\" Mr. Trudeau said in their phone call. \"Well, that's something.\" </p><p>   Weeks later, Mr. Barton was named Canada's ambassador to China. His first test was a meeting with Mr. Xi in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. The ambassador delivered a short speech in his halting Mandarin during an exchange that lasted barely a minute. </p><p>   \"My mission here is to resolve this issue,\" Mr. Barton said. \"I want to get Madam Meng and our people home.\" </p><p>   \"I didn't know you spoke Mandarin,\" Mr. Xi said. </p><p>   \"I don't . . . that's the only Mandarin I know,\" the executive replied. </p><p>   Mr. Xi smiled. \"It takes two people to repair a relationship,\" he said. </p><p>   China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, then offered his own rough-edged advice. </p><p>   \"You got a lot of work to do,\" Mr. Wang said, slapping Mr. Barton's back. \"You better exercise hard!\" </p><p>   Shortly after, Mr. Barton made his first visit to a Chinese prison. Guards escorted him past an interrogation room holding a metal chair with straps. </p><p>   He met Mr. Spavor in a reception room. Mr. Spavor, struggling with sleep, looked numb. \"How long will this go on?\" he said. \"Every day I wake up, and it's the same.\" </p><p></p>",
