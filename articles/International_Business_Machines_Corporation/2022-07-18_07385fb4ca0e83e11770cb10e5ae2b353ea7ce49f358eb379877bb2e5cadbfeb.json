  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 328 points, or 1%, to 31,617.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 32 points, or 0.8%, to trade at 3,895.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped 122 points, or 1.1%, to 11,574.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow rose 658 points, or 2.2%, as it and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite trimmed weekly losses.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS jumped more than 5% to lead Dow gainers after the investment-banking giant posted a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit, although earnings fell from the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Bank of America Corp. BAC shares rose 2.9% after the bank fell short of Wall Street's profit estimate, but revenue matched the analyst view as the first full week of the U.S. second-quarter earnings season gets under way. IBM IBM will deliver its figures after the closing bell. Reports from other big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase JPM, were not initially well-received last week.</p><p>But the market mood brightened by Friday — and continued on Monday, after Federal Reserve officials talked down the prospects of a 100-basis point rate hike at next week's policy meeting.</p><p>Read: Investors are obsessed with size of Fed's next rate hike. Here's what they're missing.</p><p>The chances of such a sharp tightening are now less than 30%, compared with more than 90% last Thursday, and a 75 basis point move to 2.25% to 2.50% is baked in. The dollar index DXY eased from 20-year highs in response, falling 0.6% to 107.44.</p><p>Traders were watching to see if upside momentum would continue after a strong Friday close that saw major indexes rally into the final bell and end near session highs.</p><p>\"The bulls need the [S&amp;P 500] to break 3,950, which could set off a trend,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Australia-based Pepperstone, in a note.</p><p>A follow-through in the rally \"could see some systematic players cover shorts, propelling the market higher — don't discount the impact that may have on options market makers too, and the need to buy back delta hedges is also there,\" Weston wrote.</p><p>Strategists at Deutsche Bank noted that aside from earnings, and with the Fed now in the premeeting blackout period, it would be a quiet week for U.S. macroeconomic catalysts, and that attention may turn elsewhere.</p><p>\"All things European will be at the forefront of market attention this week with the highlight being the ECB's likely first rate hike since 2011 on Thursday. Gas flows from Russia after maintenance on the Nord Stream pipeline ends the same day will also be a big focus with the EU expected to detail energy contingency plans the day before,\" said Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Dow component Boeing Co. BA rose 4.4% after the aerospace and defense giant said Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL would order 100 of its 737-10 jets as the air carrier modernizes its single-aisle fleet. Delta shares rose 5.8%.</p><p>* Elon Musk filed a motion Friday opposing Twitter Inc.'s TWTR request to expedite a trial over his intention to terminate his $44 billion takeover. Twitter shares were down 0.4%.</p><p>How other assets are faring</p><p>* Oil futures were higher with U.S. crude futures CL.1 adding 1.8% to $99.38 a barrel, also benefiting from signs that U.S. President Joe Biden had not secured an immediate increase in Saudi Arabian supply.</p><p>* The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 2 basis points to 2.953%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar index DXY fell 0.6%, helping to inspire gains for gold GC00, which rose 0.5%.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced 5.9% to $22,041.</p><p>* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 XX:SXXP rose 1.5%, while the FTSE 100 UK:UKX rose 1.3%.</p><p>* Asia markets got an added lift from signs the Chinese authorities will look to support the construction sector and ease monetary policy.
