  "title": "What CEOs Are Saying: 'We See Inflation Deeply Entrenched'; Leaders from Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Tesla and elsewhere give their thoughts on the economy, supply chain and consumer spending",
  "text": "<p>Here is what some of the world's corporate leaders said in their quarterly earnings reports recently about the economy, supply chain, and the advertising and energy markets.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive David Solomon:</p><p>\"We see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy…In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chains. Our economists, meanwhile, say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second half of the year. The answer is uncertain.\" (July 18)</p><p>Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Jane Fraser:</p><p>\"While sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-Covid levels, with household savings providing a cushion for future stress, and as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheets…So, while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory.\" (July 15)</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. Chief Executive Arvind Krishna:</p><p>\"If I look at our pipelines, our pipelines are remaining pretty healthy. So, I would tell you that right now what we're seeing is that the second half at this point looks pretty consistent to the first half when we look at our pipelines…Which is why you've heard me often say I'm a bit more optimistic than many of my peers, both within the industry and across the board, because we see that technology…is deflationary.\" (July 18)</p><p>Seagate Technology Holdings PLC Chief Executive Dave Mosley:</p><p>\"I think some of the supply-demand picture is changing very rapidly. The things that were constrained components six months ago may not be constrained anymore because of a lot of macro issues. It's not completely all clear yet, there are still component shortages that are affecting the enterprise.\" (July 21)</p><p>J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. Chief Commercial Officer Shelley Simpson:</p><p>\"I think, not unlike what's happened in the pandemic the last two years, there is continuing to be challenges in the supply chain that are creating uncertainty in the market, in particular with our customers around inventory, which is really generated from consumer behavior.\" (July 19)</p><p>Lockheed Martin Corp. Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave:</p><p>\"Going back in the beginning of the year, everyone was impacted by the latest variant that we had…And I think our ability to recover from that has been more challenging than we had originally anticipated. We have seen some level of improvement in certain areas of not only our operations but also our supplier operations, but we've also seen broken commitments at the same time.\" (July 19)</p><p>Alcoa Corp. Chief Executive Roy Harvey:</p><p>\"We look out at demand, and we continue to see growth this year. There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of questions particularly in Europe and of course China with Covid. So there's the potential that we continue to see customers stepping away. But realistically, what we're seeing right now is that demand continues to grow for the year. And so we continue to have a good, full order book.\" (July 20)</p><p>Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk:</p><p>\"I think inflation will decline towards the end of this year. We're certainly seeing prices of commodities trending lower, but take it with a grain of salt…making economic prognostication is fraught with error.\" (July 20)</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc. Chief Executive John Stankey:</p><p>\"I hate to describe it this way, but I think we got a little bit of a tale of two cities going on here. And when you see 9% inflation, it tends to hit those in the low-end of the market really, really hard…The flip side is you've got another segment of the population that banked a lot of money during the pandemic. They weren't traveling. They weren't dining out. They were feeling a little bit more flush, and they're making different decisions.\" (July 21)</p><p>Verizon Communications Inc. Chief Executive Hans Vestberg:</p><p>\"As I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we're seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior, and we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention.\" (July 22)</p><p>Philip Morris International Inc. Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau:</p><p>\"Yes, difficult beginning of the year. Doesn't mean that everything will be back to normal in H2. That will be still with some headwind, but clearly most of what we are facing is temporary; and there will be, over time, a recovery on the margin..\" (July 21)</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk:</p><p>\"We did build in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners.\" (July 19)</p><p>Netflix Inc. Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings:</p><p>\"We're talking about losing one million [paid subscribers] instead of losing two million, so our excitement is tempered by the less-bad results. But looking forward, streaming is working everywhere. Everyone is pouring in. It's definitely the end of linear TV over the next five, 10 years.\" (July 19)</p><p>Snap Inc. Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen :</p><p>\"Advertising spending—in particular, auction-driven direct-response advertising—is among the very few line items in a company's cost structure that they can reduce immediately in response to pressure on their top line or their input costs. As a result, as many industries and verticals have come under top-line or input-cost pressure, advertising spending has been amongst the first areas impacted.\" (July 21)</p><p>Omnicom Group Inc. Chief Executive John Wren :</p><p>\"We just got back from the Cannes Festival where I had the occasion to be personally with quite a number of our largest clients. And if I had to characterize the point of view, everybody is cautious because of the unknowns that are out there. But most sophisticated marketers who have lived through past recessions know that if they cut back too dearly, they lose sales as the recoveries start to happen.\" (July 19)</p><p>Halliburton Co. Chief Executive Jeff Miller:</p><p>\"I believe the oil-and-gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle. From a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Postpandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight.\" (July 19)</p><p>Schlumberger NV Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch:</p><p>\"The macro environment we are facing is quite unique. It's a confluence [of] unprecedented low spare capacity, eight years of underinvestment in international basins and a call for energy security that is creating a double sourcing of both oil and gas.\" (July 22)</p><p>Tractor Supply Co. Chief Executive Hal Lawton:</p><p>\"We're not seeing a precipitous drop-off anywhere. It's just the continued evolution as you always have in the business and maybe a little bit more faster evolving, just given the market dynamics that we've all been operating in over the last two or three years.\" (July 21)</p><p>Mattel Inc. Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz: </p><p>Ynon Kreiz PHOTO: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>\"Based on our own internal analysis, the importance of toys for families continue to be high, and most shoppers plan to spend the same or more on toys in 2022 as they did in 2021…Demand remains higher than prepandemic levels, and we expect traditional holiday season shopping pattern to return and, in general, the consumption pattern to come back.\" (July 21)</p><p>Boston Beer Co. Chief Executive Dave Burwick:</p><p>\"Hard seltzer has lost its novelty as consumers have been distracted by many new beyond-beer products entering a hypercrowded marketplace.\" (July 21)</p><p>Quotes were pulled from transcripts provided by FactSet.</p><p>Write to George Stahl at george.stahl@wsj.com</p><p>What CEOs Are Saying: 'We See Inflation Deeply Entrenched'</p>",
