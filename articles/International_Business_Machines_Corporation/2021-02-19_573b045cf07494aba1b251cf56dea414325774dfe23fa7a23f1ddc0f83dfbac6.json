  "title": "IBM Considers Health Unit Exit",
  "text": "<p>The unit, which employs artificial intelligence to help hospitals, insurers and drugmakers manage their data, has roughly $1 billion in annual revenue and isn't currently profitable, the people said.</p><p>Its brands include Merge Healthcare, which analyzes mammograms and MRIs; Phytel, which assists with patient communications and Truven Health Analytics, which analyzes complex healthcare data.</p><p>It isn't clear how much the business might fetch in a sale, and there may not be one.</p><p>IBM, with a market value of $108 billion, has been left behind as cloud-computing rivals Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. soar to valuations more than 10 times greater. The Armonk, N.Y., company has said it is focused on boosting its hybrid-cloud operations while exiting from some unrelated businesses.</p><p>In October, IBM said it planned to separate a major part of its information-technology services operations, which will be the company's biggest-ever business exit. The unit manages clients' IT infrastructure and accounts for nearly a quarter of IBM's sales and staff.</p><p>Watson was one of IBM's highest-profile initiatives in recent years and a big bet on the growing healthcare sector, though results disappointed in part because physicians were hesitant to adopt artificial intelligence. The company spent billions buying up a collection of health-related businesses that are now part of IBM Watson Health, with the aim of combining them into a vast store of patient data and applying algorithms to extract useful insights.</p><p>Watson never became the cohesive business IBM envisioned and has lost key executives in recent years.</p>",
