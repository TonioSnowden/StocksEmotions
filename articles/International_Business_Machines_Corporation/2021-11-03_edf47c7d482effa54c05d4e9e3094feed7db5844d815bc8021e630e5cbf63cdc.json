  "text": "<p>\"If you look at the data, it turns out that entrepreneurs on average earn less money than a typical employed person, work 13 hours more a week and report that it's a very stressful occupation,\" says Boris Nikolaev, assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. \"But despite that, there's overwhelming evidence in the literature that entrepreneurs report significantly higher levels of job satisfaction.\"</p><p>That's the big picture—and it's an important one. But look deeper, and the picture gets more nuanced, and more interesting. Research reveals what specifically brings happiness to entrepreneurs, and what doesn't. It shows what types of entrepreneurs are happy. And it shows that the ingredients of happiness differ for men and women and more.</p><p>Here are some of the highlights from the research.</p><p>Entrepreneurs are happy but also stressed</p><p>Academics have been asking entrepreneurs how happy they are for years, and the results are consistent, but also a little paradoxical.</p><p>\"Entrepreneurs are happier in terms of all indications of life satisfaction and work satisfaction,\" says Ute Stephan, professor of entrepreneurship at King's College London, who conducted a comprehensive review of more than 100 academic studies on entrepreneurship and well-being. \"However, they might be more stressed than the rest of us, as well.\"</p><p>This unusual mix of stress and happiness comes about, she says, because entrepreneurs tend to be deeply invested in their businesses, and their passion is a double-edged sword: It gives them a strong sense of purpose and autonomy, but it can also lead to worry, late nights, overwork and stress.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think entrepreneurship affects happiness? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Prof. Stephan says it's common for entrepreneurs to feel so passionate about what they do that they keep working longer than they should. That can quickly lead, she says, to disrupted sleep, especially because they continue to worry about work even when they have finished for the day—which affects their productivity and creativity the next day.</p><p>The stress and workload have a strong negative effect, as is evident in other studies, but the sense of doing something important and being their own boss is so gratifying that it outweighs all those negatives and leaves them happier overall.</p><p>\"What they are doing is important to them, it's part of who they are, it's part of their identity, and that's why it has such a positive impact on well-being,\" says Prof. Stephan.</p><p>Growth isn't the answer</p><p>Research has clearly established that overall, entrepreneurs are relatively happy. But it's also important to look at some of the elements that chip away at some of that happiness.</p><p>Growth, for instance. If you run a small business, it's natural to want it to grow. But will that make you happy? The results of a Swedish study of more than 1,000 small-business owners suggest otherwise. The researchers found that the owners of larger firms were no happier than those with smaller businesses.</p><p>Participants were asked to answer questions and rate their agreement with various statements on a scale from 0 to 6. Owning a bigger company was correlated with higher financial satisfaction (\"How satisfied are you with the profitability of your business?\"), but that benefit was canceled out by the stress of having more work and less free time (\"I frequently feel rushed due to insufficient time at work\").</p><p>\"When business owners think about how their life would be if the company was larger, they probably think about things like how fun it would be to hire employees and to earn more money,\" says Filip Fors Connolly, research coordinator for the Department of Sociology at Umeå University in Sweden. \"But they may not think about the increased workload and time pressure to the same extent. It's easy to forget or downplay that side.\"</p><p>Life vs. business</p><p>Another place where entrepreneurs find their happiness diminished: They work harder than they expect they will.</p><p>Alois Stutzer, professor of political economy at the University of Basel in Switzerland, analyzed survey data from over 1,000 German entrepreneurs between 1991 and 2013. The surveys asked people to rate their current life satisfaction and predict their level of happiness in five years. Consistently, they thought they would be happier. But according to the same entrepreneurs' answers five years later, they were actually less happy than their forecasts.</p><p>The entrepreneur survey showed an interesting split, however: Their job satisfaction increased, but their leisure satisfaction declined, dragging down the overall score. In other words, they were happy at work but not so happy in their lives, due to the increased workload of running a business.</p><p>For instance, the researchers compared the actual hours a week that entrepreneurs worked to their \"desired work hours\" from the survey, and found that entrepreneurs worked an average of 2.56 hours more a week than they had wanted to in the first year of self-employment, rising to 5.44 hours extra in year five.</p><p>What does all of this mean for entrepreneurs? When you're planning a new venture, try to consider how it will affect your life as a whole. \"My recommendation is to try to assess many more aspects than just the business's potential success or failure,\" Prof. Stutzer says. \"What you need isn't just a business plan, but actually more of a life plan.\"</p><p>A search for meaning</p><p>In the past, many studies of entrepreneurship have focused on autonomy as the key driver of happiness for entrepreneurs. You're in charge, you make the decisions, you decide how to spend your time.</p><p>But in a recent study, Prof. Stephan discovered that autonomy alone isn't enough. It's important, to be sure—but what entrepreneurs need, above all, is meaning. She analyzed survey data from over 22,000 people in 16 European countries, comparing their feelings of happiness with the extent to which their work gives them a sense of meaning and autonomy.</p><p>Happiness was measured by asking people to think about the past two weeks and rate how much they agree with statements like \"I have felt active and vigorous\" and \"I have felt cheerful and in good spirit\"; with meaning, it was statements like \"You have the feeling of doing useful work.\" Finally, she measured autonomy with questions such as, \"Are you able to choose or change your order of tasks?\"</p><p>She found that entrepreneurs experienced higher levels of happiness than wage-earning employees (4.37 vs. 4.28 on a scale of 1 to 6), as well as higher levels of meaning (4.56 vs. 4.25 on a scale of 1 to 5) and autonomy (2.66 vs. 1.95 on a scale of 0 to 3). Using regression analysis, she discovered that meaning was the decisive factor in entrepreneurial happiness.</p><p>\"What we found is that much more important than decision-making freedom is the sense of doing something profoundly meaningful,\" she says. \"That really energizes you, and as an entrepreneur you really need that energy to be creative and to do the work that's important to you.\"</p><p>But finding meaning in work doesn't have to be about changing the world. Framing work in terms of performing an important service can help even entrepreneurs in less glamorous industries find meaning and happiness—such as contractors who help people build a dream home, or accountants saving people from disastrous money problems. </p><p>For women entrepreneurs, the key to happiness is creativity. For men, it's teamwork. PHOTO: Doug Chayka</p><p>Men vs. women</p><p>When it comes to the qualities entrepreneurs need if they are going to be happy, the answer is different for men and women. Creativity is the key ingredient to women's happiness, the research shows. For men, it's teamwork.</p><p>Keith Hmieleski, professor of entrepreneurship at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, surveyed 303 founding CEOs of small businesses across the U.S., asking people to rate their agreement with various statements reflecting creativity (such as, \"I like to think of new ways to do things\" and \"I pride myself on being original\") and teamwork (such as, \"I work at my very best when I am a group member\" and \"I gladly sacrifice my self-interest for the benefit of the group I am in\").</p><p>The men who rated themselves more highly for teamwork tended to be happier, as were the women who rated themselves more highly for creativity.</p><p>The key to happiness—and success—is to buck stereotypes and master the qualities not typically associated with your gender, says Prof. Hmieleski. Men and women who did so experienced both more happiness and stronger company performance.</p><p>\"I think it's a matter of balance,\" he says. \"In entrepreneurship, there's a common stereotype of the 'great man' engaging in a lone risk-taking exercise, but in reality, entrepreneurship is more like raising a family, and communal and empathetic characteristics are just as important.\"</p><p>The price of failure</p><p>Although studies have found entrepreneurs to be happier than the general population, those studies are, by definition, focused on people still in business. But what about those who fail?</p><p>Prof. Nikolaev at Baylor University has answered that question, and the results make grim reading. Heanalyzed survey data from thousands of German entrepreneurs from 1985 to 2017, comparing their reported life satisfaction and health satisfaction while self-employed and after exiting self-employment.</p><p>In the survey data he analyzed, self-employed people were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their life overall and with their health on a scale of 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied). They found that people's average life satisfaction dropped from 6.2 to 5.0 after a business failure, while the life satisfaction of those who remained self-employed increased to 6.4. Health satisfaction fell more moderately, from 6.6 to 6.3 points, for those experiencing a business failure, while it remained stable for those who remained self-employed.</p><p>\"We found that the negative effect is pervasive, and it persists for several years after your business fails,\" he says. \"For entrepreneurs, it's very difficult to separate your personal identity from your professional failure. It's your baby, you're growing it, you're passionate about it, so it hurts more.\"</p><p>Give your successors freedom</p><p>Another common dream of entrepreneurs is to found a family business to pass on to their children. But a new study in Italy suggests that many founders are passing on a poisoned chalice.</p><p>The researchers used survey datato compare those who had founded their own companies with those who had gotten a company through inheritance, and they found that first-generation entrepreneurs are 10% to 15% happier than successors.</p><p>\"The reason why founders are happier is that they have more discretion about how to do their job,\" says Giancarlo Lauto, assistant professor of economics and statistics at the University of Udine, Italy. Successors, on the other hand, feel more constrained by the legacy of the company founder, even when they have been running the business themselves for decades.</p><p>Daniel Pittino, a co-author of the study and associate professor of business administration at Jönköping International Business School in Sweden and the University of Udine, says that founders who want their children to be happy in the family business should encourage them to work somewhere else first: \"It might seem counterintuitive, but we found in other research that, although there's a risk the person will stay outside the firm and never come back, you are sure that if they do come back, they'll come back motivated and aware of what they are doing.\"</p><p>Armed with fresh ideas and the confidence to implement them, successors who have worked elsewhere may be able to achieve more autonomy—and hence more happiness.</p><p>If you're happy, don't always show it</p><p>Finally, if you've overcome all the obstacles and managed to achieve happiness as an entrepreneur, should you show it? Recent research by Benjamin Warnick, assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Washington State University's Carson College of Business, suggests that would be a bad idea, at least if you're looking for funding.</p><p>Prof. Warnick used facial-expression analysis software to assess the emotions entrepreneurs expressed during funding pitches. He found that those who expressed happiness throughout the pitch generated less money than those who also expressed emotions generally seen as negative, such as anger and fear. Too much happiness, it turns out, makes you look naive and overconfident. Mixing in a little anger is a good way of showing your determination, while fear demonstrates the importance of the problem you're trying to solve.</p><p>\"Positivity is good,\" he says, \"but too much of a good thing turns bad.\"</p><p>Mr. Blackman is a writer in Serbia.
