  "text": "<p>The hot topic these days is whether the rise in prices in the US is a temporary shock due to supply and labour constraints and some pent-up demand or something more sinister. </p> <p>Martin Wolf sees risks in a “slow to respond” Federal Reserve (“The Fed risks being too slow on inflation”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f23cf87-0e66-4b6b-bf36-8c73f1bfbd9d\">Opinion</a>, June 9) and he is not wrong to be concerned. </p> <p>However, the issue is not whether the Fed will tighten its monetary grip but when it will do so and with how much information. Wolf notes the risks of acting on “outcomes” rather than “forecasts”, but coming out of a pandemic, our ability to forecast is hampered by too many unknowns. We see this clearly in the hard-to-read inflation data. Thus, waiting for more information is smart policy and there is time to react before the economy is, in his words, “smoking hot”.</p> <p>What is incorrect is to continue with injections of $120bn of liquidity every month in an economy where there is no shortage of credit. Quantitative easing needs to be on a slow and pre-announced reduction path, perhaps by $10bn a month. Yes, we know about the “taper tantrum” and markets will react, but better that they react to this minor shift than to a Fed tightening that is more dramatic. Even though we should not blame Fed policy for Latin America's debt problems, it is true that whenever rates rise in the US, there will be repercussions for emerging markets, especially those overly indebted pre- or post-Covid.</p> <p>The Fed's mandate does not include the impact of its rate-setting on the debt sustainability of global borrowers and nor should it. What Fed policy should ensure is that inflationary expectations are not unleashed and that confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency is not impaired.</p> <p>Short-circuiting a recovery with pre-emptive tightening may be ill-advised; however, continuing with credit expansion into an economy that is rapidly expanding should make the Fed more concerned about the planning of its inevitable policy shift. Timing is everything. </p> <p><strong>Danny Leipziger</strong> <br><em>Professor International Business<br>George Washington University<br>Washington, DC, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Fed is wise to await more data before tightening monetary grip' FT.com 10 June.
