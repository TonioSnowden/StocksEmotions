  "title": "Corporate Tech Leaders Are Mixed on EU Artificial Intelligence Bill; Some welcome clarity on personal data use, others say proposed regulations will stifle innovation",
  "text": "<p>Thomas Donnelly, chief information officer of software firm BetterCloud Inc., said the proposed restrictions will have a negative impact on Europe's technology sector over the long term, as companies elsewhere gain a competitive edge by continuing to develop cheaper and more efficient AI-powered applications.</p><p>\"I've been doing IT for a long time,\" Mr. Donnelly said. \"I've never seen tech as transformative as AI since the internet.\"</p><p>The European Union 's executive arm on Wednesday unveiled legislation  that would ban the use of certain kinds of AI systems, while limiting the use of facial recognition by police.</p><p>The proposal boosts regulatory oversight and sets out higher data-quality standards for the use of AI in designated \"high-risk\" areas, including critical infrastructure, college admissions and loan applications.</p><p>Carol Juel, CIO of Synchrony Financial, said actions by European regulators on technology issues are influential. AI powers the credit-card issuer's customer chatbot and helps the company catch potential fraud.</p><p>Ms. Juel said ideas from the European Union 's General Data Protection Regulation have influenced how U.S. legislators approach privacy matters since the law went into effect in 2018.</p><p>Although Synchrony doesn't do business in Europe, she will monitor how Europe's AI regulation plays out. \"Oftentimes those rules make their way across the pond,\" she said.</p><p>\"It is disappointing to see the leaders of democratic nations viewing AI with fear given the massive opportunities to cure diseases, avoid harms, distribute goods and services more efficiently, and create new jobs,\" said Stephen Messer, co-founder and vice chairman of Collective [i], an AI company focused on optimizing the sales process.</p><p>Benjamin Mueller, senior policy analyst at the Center for Data Innovation, said under the new policies, a financial firm building an AI-enabled credit-scoring system for its European market would have to perform extensive risk assessment, ensure its training data met high standards, make sure all AI-generated decisions are traceable, keep detailed technical documentation, build in human oversight measures, and more.</p><p>\"It's a huge headache for anyone starting such a company or buying that kind of software,\" Mr. Mueller said in an email.</p><p>Ted Kwartler, vice president of AI Trust at DataRobot Inc ., an AI platform developer, said the driving force behind the proposal is to protect consumers from companies misusing their personal data, a move he supports.</p><p>Mr. Kwartler, who is a member of a committee to advise the White House on government data issues, said the EU's guidelines on defining high-risk AI applications, along with built-in flexibility to re-evaluate those definitions as new use cases emerge, \"will ensure all future deployments of the technology will be fair and built with citizen safety in mind.\"</p><p>\"Our experience is that anytime there is certainty around the rules of the road for these sorts of technologies, then it's easier to do business,\" said Christian Troncoso, senior director of policy at the BSA Software Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group whose members include International Business Machines Corp ., Microsoft Corp ., Oracle Corp . and other software companies.</p><p>The use of AI in enterprise technology is on the rise, analysts say. Driven by the growing adoption of AI and other data-heavy software tools, global spending on cloud computing services is expected to reach a total of $332 billion this year, up 23% from 2020, information-technology research and consulting firm Gartner Inc . reported Wednesday.</p><p>Many companies world-wide deploy AI-enabled software to automate a range of tasks, from customer call-center services, to office administration, manufacturing and supply-chain logistics.</p><p>Mario Harik, CIO of XPO Logistics Inc., said AI capabilities help the company fulfill customer demand by optimizing the supply chain from end to end. He said regulations need to target specific uses of AI without inhibiting others. \"Using AI to forecast product inventories requires less regulation compared to AI used in autonomous vehicles,\" Mr. Harik said.</p><p>\"AI is progressing at such a rapid pace right now, both the good and the bad of it,\" said Peter van der Putten, director of decisioning solutions at software firm Pegasystems Inc .</p><p>Mr. van der Putten said tech vendors and consumers alike will benefit from clear rules and boundaries over its use, calling the proposed EU regulations a \"good first step.\"</p><p>\"In the long run, consumers will vote with their wallets,\" he added.</p><p>Sara Castellanos, Kim S. Nash and John McCormick contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p>",
