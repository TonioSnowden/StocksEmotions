  "text": "<p>ChessFest, the annual open-air day where ordinary&#xa0;players and novices&#xa0;can&#xa0;test their skills against grandmasters and masters, will be back in London's Trafalgar Square on Sunday July 17.</p> <p>The event includes free lessons by more than 50 chess coaches for children and adults, as well as top English experts taking&#xa0;on all comers in simultaneous play, blindfold chess and speed games. The boy and girl seven-year-olds, Kushal Jakhria and Bodhana Sivanandan, who won gold medals in the world age group championships in Greece and&#xa0;have performed strongly in adult competitions, will also be there.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Two of the most celebrated&#xa0;games in chess history, played 50 years ago when Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky&#xa0;at Reykjavik&#xa0;1972, and 25 years ago when IBM Deep Blue crushed Garry Kasparov in New York 1997, will be recreated on a giant screen&#xa0;in the square with 32 professional actors taking the part of the pieces.</p> <p>ChessFest comes at the start of an important&#xa0;few weeks for the game's status. The Chessable British Championships, with over 800 entries and counting, will be staged at the Riviera Centre in Torquay from August 8-21.&#xa0;</p> <p>From July 28 to August 10, the 187-nation Olympiad will be hosted in Chennai, India. England are seeded&#xa0;10th among an entry where the United States are clear favourites. China, the holders, are not competing, while Russia are banned due to the invasion of Ukraine.&#xa0;The Michael Adams-led team will hope for a top-six finish, but realistically&#xa0;will do well to maintain their seeding.</p> <p><strong>Puzzle 2477</strong></p> <p>Pavel Anisimov v Ian Nepomniachtchi, Krasnoyarsk 2007. Black, the future double world title challenger, to move and force mate.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c5c0899-7b6c-4e5b-9c1c-af26b6b0cffd\">Click here</a> for solution</p><p>Source: Leonard Barden 2022 'Chess arrives free in Trafalgar Square next Sunday' FT.com 11 July.
