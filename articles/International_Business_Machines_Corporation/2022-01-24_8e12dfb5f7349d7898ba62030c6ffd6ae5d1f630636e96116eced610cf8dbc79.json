  "title": "IBM stock rallies as results top Street view amid Kyndryl spinoff mid-quarter",
  "text": "<p>The company reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.33 billion, or $2.60 a share, compared with $1.36 billion, or $1.52 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and other items, were $3.35 a share.</p><p>Revenue rose to $16.7 billion from $15.68 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected earnings of $3.30 on revenue of $15.96 billion.</p><p>Kyndryl began trading&#xa0;on the NYSE on Nov. 4, a little more than a month into the fourth quarter. Last earnings report, &#xa0;Arvind Krishna, IBM's chairman and chief executive, discouraged analysts from using of the word “disruption” related to the spinoff and stressed that he would characterize the transition as resulting in a “slight pause.”</p><p>Just before the report, however, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who has a market perform rating, said that fourth-quarter results would be “messy, with jumbled consensus estimates.”</p><p>“IBM will report on a ‘continuing operations' basis (i.e., using new reporting segments, and without Kyndryl), but many estimates appear to have included at least one month of Kyndryl revenues,” Sacconaghi said.</p><p>“EPS is particularly challenging, as IBM issued a limited pro forma financial recast at end of December, which (1) did not provide an operating profit history for its new segments; and (2) overall, significantly understated the profitability of historical IBM,” Sacconaghi said.</p><p>“We increased revenue in the fourth quarter with hybrid cloud adoption driving growth in software and consulting,” said&#xa0;IBM's Krishna in a statement. “Our fourth-quarter results give us confidence in our ability to deliver our objectives of sustained mid-single digit revenue growth and strong free cash flow in 2022.”</p><p>Earlier in January, one analyst downgraded IBM on concerns about revenue growth following the spinoff of Kyndryl and IBM's ability to compete in the cloud market.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, IBM shares have gained nearly 14%, compared with an 11% rise on the Dow.</p>",
