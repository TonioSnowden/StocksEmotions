  "text": "<p>In US sports it is agreed “if offense is strong, the defense takes care of itself”. Similarly, strong share price performance has protected executives from challenges to their high pay. That is changing in a US where steep remuneration has started to prompt the regular investor censures already common in Europe. Bobby Kotick, the longtime boss of Activision Blizzard, is a case in point.</p> <p>Shareholders increasingly vote against management. This year 25 companies shareholders have approved executive pay packages with 75 per cent or less of the vote, up from 16 last year, according to data from Farient Advisors. Such high profile rebukes have occurred at prominent companies such as General Electric, IBM and Starbucks.</p> <p>Activision investors usually approve Kotick's big packages, and he has generally delivered big returns. Shares in the video game business have nearly tripled since the start of 2016. </p> <p>Yet, this year shareholder approval in a non-binding, say-on-pay vote appears to be in doubt. On Wednesday Activision oddly allowed another week of voting on this measure, despite concluding its annual meeting. The board announced results for every other ballot measure. </p> <p>Further debate is understandable. Kotick's 2020 “long-term performance incentive” has hit $124m according to company filings.&#xa0;Activision blames the windfall on the share price surge. </p> <p>Institutional shareholders are increasingly resistant to large CEO pay packages. These have edged up through benchmarking against peer group averages that ensures everybody below the mean can claim a pay rise. Even shareholders who have profited handsomely are losing their previous deference to management. </p> <p>A year ago, just over half of voting shareholders approved the non-binding proposal on pay at Activision. That prompted the board to cut Kotick's base salary in half, to less than $1m. Additionally, it trimmed annual and long-term share grants. </p> <p>Activision claims these have brought the CEO's target remuneration below the median for his peers. The maximum payout of Kotick's latest long-term award is a paltry $32m.</p> <p>An activist organisation, CtW Investment Group, remains unimpressed. It argues that the changes in Kotick's contract extension really only restrain his pay for one year, 2022. Afterwards the company can then enrich Kotick at will.</p> <p>Activision believes that it has made good faith efforts to respond to investor concern. Perhaps, but the accumulation of years of shareholder frustration and the shift in perceptions of pay will be tough to overcome with an extra week of voting.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'US CEO pay: shareholders have woken up to excess' FT.com 16 June.
