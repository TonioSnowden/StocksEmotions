The money can be great, but it comes with a constant fear of getting caught.  ----  By Rachel Feintzeig",
  "text": "<p>   They were bored. Or worried about layoffs. Or tired of working hard for a meager raise every year. They got another job offer. </p><p>   Now they have a secret. </p><p>   A small, dedicated group of white-collar workers, in industries from tech to banking to insurance, say they have found a way to double their pay: Work two full-time remote jobs, don't tell anyone and, for the most part, don't do too much work, either. </p><p>   Alone in their home offices, they toggle between two laptops. They play \"Tetris\" with their calendars, trying to dodge endless meetings. Sometimes they log on to two meetings at once. They use paid time off -- in some cases, unlimited -- to juggle the occasional big project or ramp up at a new gig. Many say they don't work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined. They don't apologize for taking advantage of a system they feel has taken advantage of them. </p><p>   \"It's two jobs for one,\" says a 29-year-old software engineer who has been working simultaneously for a media company and an events company since June. He estimates he was logging three to 10 hours of actual work a week back when he held down one job. \"The rest of it is just attending meetings and pretending to look busy.\" </p><p>   He was emboldened by a new website called Overemployed. Started by two tech workers this spring, it aims to rally workers around the concept of stealthily holding multiple jobs, framing it as a way to wrest back control after decades of stalled wages for some and a pandemic that led to unpredictable layoffs. </p><p>   Gig work and outsourcing have been on the rise for years. Inflation is now ticking up, chipping away at spending power. Some employees in white-collar fields wonder why they should bother spending time building a career. </p><p>   \"The harder that you work, it seems like the less you get,\" one of the workers with two jobs says. \"People depend on you more. My paycheck is the same.\" </p><p>   Overemployed says it has a solution. </p><p>   \"There's no implied lifetime employment anymore, not even at IBM,\" writes one of the website's co-founders, a 38-year-old who works for two tech companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. The site serves up tips on setting low expectations with bosses, staying visible at meetings and keeping LinkedIn profiles free of red flags. (A \"social-media cleanse\" is a solid excuse for an outdated LinkedIn profile, it says.) In a chat on the messaging platform Discord, people from around the world swap advice about employment checks and downtime at various brand-name companies. </p><p>   \"Avoid the slippery ladder in your career,\" one Overemployed post says. \"Take the side door instead.\" </p><p>   This article is based on conversations with a half-dozen workers who have secretly worked multiple full-time jobs, as employees and contractors, during the pandemic. The workers spoke anonymously for fear of being fired or not being able to pull off the arrangement again. The approach doesn't violate federal or state laws, according to employment lawyers, but it could represent a breach of contract or raise issues around confidentiality. And it could certainly result in an employee's termination. </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal verified the workers' accounts by examining offer letters, employment contracts, concurrent pay stubs and corporate emails. Most of them say they are on track to earn a total of $200,000 to nearly $600,000 a year, including bonuses and stock. They have paid off chunks of student-loan debt, plumped their kids' college-savings accounts and bought everything from an engagement ring to a sports car with the extra cash. </p><p>   The money is incredible, the 29-year-old software engineer says. So is the stress: \"I'll wake up in the morning and I'm like, 'Oh, this is the day I'm gonna get found out.'\" </p><p>   The Overemployed co-founder's journey to two jobs started with a career slump. Passed over last year for a promotion he thought was in the bag, he saw half his team get promoted instead. Next came layoffs. He started looking for another job, assuming his number would soon be up. </p><p>   Upon receiving an offer from a tech company less than 10 miles down the road, he figured he would quit his current job. Then it occurred to him: What if he didn't? </p><p>   \"When push comes to shove, you're going to become a number,\" he says. He launched the website early this spring, five months after starting his second job, with the aim of alerting other workers to the possibility of diversifying their sources of income and benefits. \"They say it's a free market. I'm going to go ahead and get mine too.\" </p><p>   The pandemic has given us new opportunities to shirk and fib. No matter how many check-ins they load on someone's calendar, bosses can't keep tabs on remote workers like they did when they sat one desk over. </p><p>   Employees feel the freedom. The change is logistical -- a worker can head to the beach this afternoon, and no one has to know -- as well as emotional. After months away from the office, where workers forged deeper relationships with colleagues and identified more with their companies, many feel increasingly disconnected from their employers, says Vanessa Burbano, a management professor at Columbia Business School who has studied employee misconduct. </p><p>   To be sure, many employees have filled their days at home with more work, feeling pressure to prove themselves. But others have taken their foot off the pedal. </p><p>   The tech worker started declining calendar invitations for meetings. Nothing happened. </p><p>   \"The beauty of working remotely is you actually have a choice,\" he says. The boss at his first company, he says, was distracted by managing up. The worker started handing off responsibilities to an eager new colleague. He took advantage of the company's unlimited PTO policy with a month off, citing Covid-19 burnout. By now he has perfected the art of diplomatically declining colleague requests. (Sorry, not enough bandwidth, he tells them.) If a complex project gets bogged down by co-workers, he doesn't try to get things back on track; delays can make it easier for him to juggle his multiple professional identities. </p><p>   He spends his days switching off among three laptops -- work, personal, other work -- keeping the one for his new job synced up to a desktop monitor and his other work computer open beside it. </p><p>   \"You have to physically switch and then that keys up your brain to say this is Job 1 or Job 2,\" he says. To maintain separation and secrecy, other workers swear by color-coding browser windows or using external microphones that can be muted without alerting others on a video call. One worker manages double meetings by logging on to one via computer and the other via phone. </p><p>   \"I've gotten better at hearing two different things at the same time and trying to process it,\" he says. The phone enables a quick getaway if one meeting risks hearing the other during a sudden unmute situation. </p><p>   When the worker gets called on simultaneously in both meetings -- it happens -- he drops one call, answers the other's query and then pops back onto the \"dropped\" call. Sorry, he had a network issue. What was the question again? </p><p>   Even better: Evade the meeting altogether. He often tells colleagues he doesn't think their issue requires a call, and he can help them faster on Slack. </p><p>   \"People love it because they're like, 'This guy just gets [stuff] done. He's not wasting his time in these meetings,'\" he says. </p><p>   One software engineer in Europe who has held down two jobs for most of the past few years says he was confused by the scene in his office when he first started working as a developer several years ago. Everyone looked so busy, but it didn't seem like they were getting much done. Was he just a superfast, talented developer? </p><p>   \"I think because I was new to the business I didn't fully understand the unwritten rules,\" says the man, who gave up his most recent second job in June but plans to try for a second one again in September. </p><p>   He took on his first double gig in 2018, telling his original company he would be attending a cybersecurity course in London. He moved there for several months, spent the hours he was supposedly at the nonexistent class at a new contract assignment, and earned an extra $350 a day. He has since cycled through several other remote double jobs, varying his use of video on calls so it won't look weird if he needs to go audio-only and using two laptops, with the speakers muted on one, to pull off double-booked meetings. </p><p>   Once, he unmuted his speaker too quickly before turning off the sound on the other laptop. For five seconds, Meeting One could hear Meeting Two. He cringed. No one noticed. </p><p>   Anybody who lives a double life for long enough will experience a close call. One worker was confused about his compensation and pulled up his pay stub to show his manager the discrepancy. To his horror, the paystub from his other job was listed on the same platform. He quickly stopped sharing his screen, telling his manager he didn't feel comfortable showing his paycheck. </p><p>   A data scientist in Richmond, Va., was surprised when his boss suddenly reached out for a video call -- the team never did video calls -- while he was teaching a coding class at his secret second job. He told the students to take a 10-minute break and jumped on his other computer. Overemployed has a list of possible moves and excuses for those in a pickle, like an imaginary call from a child's school. </p><p>   The data scientist had long been frustrated by the pace at his big bank. </p><p>   \"I just felt like I wasn't doing anything,\" he says. He wanted to do contracting work on the side, but stuck in the office, it felt impossible. When the pandemic sent him home in March 2020, he saw his chance, and began working for three other companies. </p><p>   \"I had nothing to do,\" he says of those early locked-down months. \"It was the perfect time to try something.\" </p><p>   Soon he was working 100-hour weeks. Little of it was for his original job. Eventually, his manager confronted him, asking him to ramp up his effort. </p><p></p>",
