  "text": "<p>Working from home has been a tailwind for IT services group <strong>Computacenter</strong>, which lifted earnings guidance second time in as many months.</p> <p>Computacenter said trading has continued positively through to the end of the year, meaning adjusted&#xa0;profit before tax for 2020 will be in excess of £195m. Its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/623fcb46-2160-4b84-9c3c-f59d0fe08ec3\">December update</a> had set a target of not less than £190m.</p> <p>Total revenue grew by 8 per cent on public sector and services-based demand, though spend slowed materially among customers in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, Computacenter said. Travel restrictions had helped cut costs and improve margins.</p> <p>“The positive momentum we have seen in trading since the start of the pandemic shows no sign of abating, and our pipelines for both Technology Sourcing and Services are as strong as at any time we have seen in the last year,” the company said. </p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Next </strong>has said it has pulled out of the bidding to buy Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group out of administration. The company — whose bid in partnership with investment group Davidson Kempner Capital was reported last week to be leading the auction — said in a statement that the consortium had been “unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor”.</p> <p>Department store group <strong>John Lewis</strong> said it expects to deliver a full-year profit following better than expected Christmas trading. Earnings will be ahead of guidance given at the half year in September, when the company forecast a small loss or a small profit for the full-year period. John Lewis also said it has enough liquidity to repay £300m borrowed from the government's Covid-19 loan scheme two months early.</p> <p><strong>Mediclinic</strong>, the operator of private hospitals in South Africa and Switzerland, said it remained cautious on the near-term outlook as the pandemic had reduced visibility on activity levels. It posted an 8 per cent fall in ebitda for the three months to December. </p> <p><strong>TheWorks</strong>, the gift and hobby retailer, reported a £4.3m pre-tax loss for its half year ended October. Revenue was down 7.8 per cent to £88.9m. Temporary store closures and government restrictions have affected trading since the end of the period so total sales fell 24.8 per cent in the 11 weeks to January 10, it said.</p> <p>Private equity group Alchemy Partners has formally withdrawn from the bidding to buy <strong>Countrywide</strong>, the estate agent, which has agreed a £130m takeover by privately owned peer Connells. </p> <p>Toy maker <strong>Character Group</strong>, whose brand licences include Peppa Pig and Pokemon, said group UK sales for the last four months of 2020 were up&#xa0;around 25 per cent and that international demand had improved significantly, particularly in the US. Management noted lockdown disruption and sharply higher freight costs from Asia. But, assuming no further worsening of these conditions, it expected to match current market expectations for the year ending August.</p> <p><strong>International Personal Finance</strong>, the doorstep money lender, said the Polish government has approved the extension of a temporary interest rate cap on new loans. Poland, IPF's most important market, will extend the cap from March to June.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Intel </strong>said it was the victim of a hacker who stole financially sensitive information from its corporate website <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b14742ed-c070-4d16-9696-96fe72ac04b8\">on Thursday</a>, prompting the company to release its earnings statement ahead of schedule.&#xa0;The US computer chipmaker believed an attacker had obtained advanced details about a strong earnings report it was due to publish after the stock market closed. It published its formal earnings announcement upon discovering the problem, six minutes before the market closed.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> paid its chief executive,&#xa0;Jamie Dimon, $31.5m for 2020, the same sum as the previous year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f852f8-f4a2-4ff1-a7d0-72a00ada9b64\">the US bank disclosed on Thursday</a>. Mr Dimon, who suffered a serious health scare last year and was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, is consistently one of the highest-paid US bank bosses. JPMorgan shares fell 8 per cent in 2020, more than rival Bank of America and the KBW bank index, which lost 5.5 per cent. </p> <p><strong>IBM </strong>revealed its revenue decline <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59e7ec7b-df49-4aba-ab2e-4aa07f3771fd\">accelerated in the final quarter</a> of last year as its normal end-of-year IT spending bounce by customers proved weaker than expected. However, the US technology company still said it expected to return to growth this year, reinstating revenue guidance it scrapped after the pandemic hit early last year. The latest figures highlighted IBM's long struggle to return to sustainable growth after several years of contraction.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Robert Smith</strong> <br>Every year the FT holds a charity stockpicking contest for its journalists, when know-it-all writers test their mettle against the markets. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc216a97-fa6e-4963-8d73-b933c94b78d0\">How did they do?</a> Our capital market correspondent tallies up the winners and losers.</p> <p><strong>Lombard</strong> <br>Brits love bricks.
