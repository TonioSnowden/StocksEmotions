  "title": "Technology:  Xerox CEO Visentin  Dies, Interim Named  ----  By Cara Lombardo and Alex Harring",
  "text": "<p>   Giovanni \"John\" Visentin,  chief executive of Xerox Holdings Corp., died after running the printer-and-copier company for roughly four years. </p><p>   Mr. Visentin, 59 years old, died on Tuesday \"due to complications from an ongoing illness,\" the company said Wednesday. Steve Bandrowczak, Xerox's chief operations officer and president, will serve as interim CEO. </p><p>   Xerox declined to comment on the illness or when Mr. Visentin notified the company about it. </p><p>   A veteran technology executive, Mr. Visentin joined Xerox in May 2018 and led the company through the pandemic. Mr. Visentin led Xerox's bid in late 2019 to buy rival HP Inc., which at the time was more than three times its size. The move was supported by Carl Icahn, the activist investor who is a major Xerox shareholder and whose representatives hold seats on its board. HP rejected Xerox's overtures and Xerox abandoned its pursuit early in the pandemic. </p><p>   Mr. Visentin previously managed business units at HP and International Business Machines Corp. and worked with Apollo Global Management portfolio companies. </p><p></p>",
