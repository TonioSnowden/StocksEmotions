  "title": "Forget Ferrari, This Fashion Designer Has Zero Apologies for His Honda; Jerome Peel's 'Honda genius' father steered him away from a costly supercar to a 1991 NSX",
  "text": "<p>Over the past couple years, I started thinking about buying a new car. I was working so hard and saving all my money, and for what? Like my dad, I've always loved cars, and I wanted something badass. I started sending him pictures of Porsches and Ferraris. Every time, he was, like, \"Nope. Don't do it. Do you know how much it costs to replace a clutch in a Ferrari?\" Then one day I sent him a photo of an NSX. He responded, \"That, I can get behind. That is my dream car.\"</p><p>Honda launched the NSX in model year 1991, basically to compete with Ferrari with a mid-engine [the motor is right behind the driver], V-6 sports car that wasn't exactly affordable, but cheaper than a Ferrari and, ideally, just as fun to drive. Everyone who knows about these cars, when they hear NSX, they say: Way ahead of its time.</p><p>Five months ago, I found my car in a dealership in Connecticut. It's a 1991, from the first model year, and while the NSX was always marketed in the U.S. as an Acura, mine is a Honda because it was built for the Japanese market, where Acura doesn't exist, and later imported here. The steering wheel is on the right-hand side, which I love because it's a little different.</p><p>It was an impulse buy and, at $50,000, I felt like I was getting a good deal. I should've done more research, but sometimes you can do an impulse buy and be happy forever. When I started my company, I bought my first embroidery machine without doing any research and it turned out to be the best machine I could've bought. Sometimes life works that way.</p><p>As soon as I got this car it had issue after issue. But here's the thing: It's a Honda. If you can screw in a lightbulb, you can fix a Honda. The first issue I had was the door locks and the alarm. That was easy to fix. The second issue was the thermostat. Easy to fix. Then a radiator hose. All of that stuff, I fixed in the parking lot of Advance Auto Parts in Brooklyn. When my ignition died, I went to New Jersey in my girlfriend's Honda del Sol (which I helped her pick out), bought a new ignition, and installed it in my NSX in 10 minutes using nothing but a Phillips-head screwdriver.</p><p>But that's not what makes this car so cool. You can be having the worst day, and if you jump in the NSX, everything changes. Every time I get it at my garage and the attendant pulls it up, I'm like, holy sâ€”. It shocks me every time I see it. I love cruising around the city or, even more, cruising upstate. I drive it to Trader Joe's, or to the East Village for dinner. It has the best suspension and handling of any car I've driven.</p><p>But sometimes, just sitting in a car you love is all you have to do. My dad pushed me to buy a Honda, and I am thankful he did.</p><p>My Ride</p><p>* Whatever You Drove in College Isn't as Cool as His Firetruck</p><p>* James Bond Might Not Take This Aston Martin on Grocery Runs</p><p>* Everybody on Martha's Vineyard Knows the Mercedes Called 'Big Blue'</p><p>* His Vintage British 'Rocket Ship' Is a Rare Find in the U.S.</p><p>Write to A.J.
