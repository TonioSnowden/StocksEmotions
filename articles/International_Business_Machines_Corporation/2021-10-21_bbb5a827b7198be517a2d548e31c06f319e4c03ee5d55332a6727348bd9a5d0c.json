He expects households to keep spending savings accumulated during the pandemic.</p><p>International Business Machines shares fell 7.6%, on pace for largest decrease since January, after the company reported weaker revenue that analysts had expected in the latest quarter.

Tesla added 3.2% after the auto maker said late Wednesday it had notched a third-straight record quarterly profit.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly lower. Shares of China Evergrande Group slumped 13% in Hong Kong after the embattled developer canceled plans to sell a majority stake in its property-management unit, a setback in attempts to ease its continuing cash crisis.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5%, Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.9% and China's Shanghai Composite Index ticked up 0.2%.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%, led down by stocks in the basic-resources, auto and industrial sectors.
