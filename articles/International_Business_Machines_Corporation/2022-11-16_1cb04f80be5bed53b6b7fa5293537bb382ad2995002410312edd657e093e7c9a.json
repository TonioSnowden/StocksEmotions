  "title": "10 Home Decor Holiday Gifts for 2022 With Timeless Appeal; What feels right this holiday: a return to heirloom-quality presents. A print of 'Starry Night' might be destined for a yard sale. But a framed, hand-woven art work from an up-and-coming maker? Precious.",
  "text": "<p>Haand's three-piece serving set looks as if it were hewn from centuries-old trees. But its burl finish is in fact the glaze on ultra-durable and dishwasher-safe porcelain. Your giftees (and possibly their progeny) will be able to whip out the 18-inch platter and smaller plates (13-inch and 15-inch) for both special occasions and daily grub for years to come. 3 Piece Serving Platter Set in Burl, $265, Haand.us</p><p>A More Modern Menorah</p><p>The traditional menorah becomes a covetable work of contemporary art in this interpretation, designed by the self-proclaimed \"Modernist Judaica\" label Via Maris. Colorful glass creates a sculptural silhouette that is anything but ordinary, a look that a Hanukkah-celebrating aesthete will value for the foreseeable future. Glass Chanukiah, $235, Via-Maris.com</p><p>A Midcentury Clock Whose Time Has Come Again</p><p>Though our homes are lousy with digital time-keepers—on the stove, in the set-top cable box—it's nice to have a couple of hands and big old numbers to tell the hour less coldly. This redesign of IBM's Indicator Clock, a midcentury stalwart of factory and classroom walls that's over 13 inches across, includes a glass crystal and dusky-red steel housing. Tap into a Boomer's nostalgia or a Zoomer's penchant for all things analog by giving this bold, battery-powered ticker. 1960s IBM Standard Issue Clock in Paprika, $299, Schoolhouse.com</p><p>A One-of-a-Kind Bauhaus-Inspired Weaving</p><p>Do you have giftees whose depressingly white walls need filling with something other than another cookie-cutter Matisse print? Treat them to a colorful composition by London artist Dalia James, who crafts meticulous Bauhaus-inspired weavings using heritage techniques and biodegradable bamboo, wool and silk that's been hand-dyed, so no two pieces are the same. Toast x Dalia James Hand Woven Artwork, $375, US.TOA.ST</p><p>Launch a Kid's Library With a Leather-Bound Favorite</p><p>The children's classic \"Goodnight Moon\" celebrates 75 years of noble bedtime-story service this year. Written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated in vivid hues by Clement Hurd, the tale narrates the nighttime ritual of an anthropomorphic bunny as he bids sleep-tight to kittens, mittens and red balloons. This edition's cushiony, midnight-blue leather cover and golden embossed letters, including personalizable name and date, ensures the book an extended shelf life. Leather Bound Goodnight Moon, $69 plus $13 for personalization, MarkAndGraham.com</p><p>A Historic Offering From A Cult-Favorite Potter</p><p>Ceramics cognoscenti seek out art-historian-turned-potter Frances Palmer's vases for their classical shapes inspired by English earthenware and Japanese porcelain. The hitch? Their equally elevated price. But here's a holiday miracle: The artisan has recently released an affordable new line of bud vases, hand-cast by a pottery in England's Stoke-on-Trent (the historic cradle of the British china industry) using molds made from her hand-thrown designs—timeless gifts with serious ceramics cachet. Cirrus Bud Vases, from $190, FrancesPalmerPottery.com</p><p>A Tree Skirt That Defies Christmas Colors</p><p>For too long, green and red have dominated Christmas décor, and this Technicolor tree skirt is here to usher in a more worldly, colorful tradition. Weavers sew together vintage Frezada blankets—made of sheep's wool hearty enough to warm the people of the Andean highlands and weather countless holidays—to create a festive statement piece. Be warned: May steal attention from the wrapped gifts nearby. But for design lovers, that is a happy problem to have. Coral Frazada Tree Skirt, $225, StFrank.com</p><p>A Personalized Stamp For Print Lovers</p><p>For literary types who wouldn't be caught dead with an e-reader, Milan-based artist Clara De Lorenzi offers personalized bookplates, or Ex Libris. Bookplates date to around the 15th century, when the heraldic designs (often reflecting their owner's hobbies—falconry, anyone?) were used to mark precious manuscripts. Surprise a bibliophile with one of Ms. De Lorenzi's ready-made stamps, or commission a bespoke one tailored to their name and tastes. Extra credit: Give a vintage hardcover to christen it with. Ex Libris Basic Collection 04, from about $31, ClaraDeLorenzi.com</p><p>A Best-Case Scenario When it Comes to Pillowcases</p><p>Few things evoke grandma's trousseau as potently as lace-trimmed linens. The silk organza lace on these pillowcases is subtly patterned, however, giving these covers an elegant flourish more contemporary than crusty. Adding to their gem-like quality: The rare pattern is applied to a limited release of 100 pieces. Available in a crisp white and a buttery winter white, the cases are woven of silk and Tencel, a plant-based fabric known for its softness and machine-washability. Seraphina Pillowcase With Lace in Winter White, from $160 each, BellaNotteLinens.com</p><p>SPLURGE: A Custom-Made Quilt to Remember</p><p>Is your family's attic cluttered with baby clothes that haven't seen daylight since the Carter administration? Here's an idea: Liberate those dresses and dungarees from the cobwebby recesses, then enlist Brooklyn-based quilter Zak Foster to fashion them into a custom \"memory-quilt.\" The personalized process is rooted in conversation and, once the quilt has been started, takes about 4 to 6 weeks to finish—resulting in a piece of functional art that will warm beds and hearts for generations. Custom Memory Quilt, from $1,500, ZakFoster.com</p><p>WHAT HEIRLOOM MEANS TO ME </p><p>To celebrate timeless gifts, we asked furniture and lighting designer Lee Broom what treasure he values most.</p><p>\"My parents and grandparents weren't wealthy, so there was no kind of furniture or clock that was passed down,\" said London-based designer Lee Broom, whose family hails from the British Midlands. \"But my mother passed away fairly recently, and I was clearing out her apartment and came across a small bag of three or four medals that I remember being in her jewelry box when I was a child.\" The locket-sized charms had been awarded to his grandmother for dancing competitions at the local ballroom in the 1920s and '30s. \"They're silver and engraved very simply on the back with the year and her name, Lilian Lee, for winning the foxtrot,\" said the designer, who describes the medals' decoration as hinting at Art Deco, almost industrial. \"Since then, I've worn them as pendants around my own neck,\" said Mr. Broom, whose book \"Lee Broom: Fashioning Design,\" by Rizzoli, with text by Becky Sunshine, was published this month. \"They aren't very expensive, but they're precious to me.\"</p><p>Explore buy side from wsj</p><p>* The 15 Best Gifts for Hosts</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
