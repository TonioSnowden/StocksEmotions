  "text": "<p>Rigetti Computing, one of the first start-ups to take on the giants of the tech industry in the new field of quantum computing, is planning to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that values it at about $1.5bn.</p> <p>The proposed listing, which is set to raise $457m, is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23177383-91f8-4ab8-8eaf-552f552d7a15\">latest sign </a>of the large amounts of cash being ploughed into a technology that until recently was considered little more than a science experiment. </p> <p>Quantum computers employ quantum mechanics to accelerate the speed at which they carry out calculations, potentially handling tasks far beyond anything today's supercomputers can manage.</p> <p>Founded eight years ago by Chad Rigetti, a physicist who previously worked at IBM, the California-based company has taken longer than it first predicted to reach the cusp of commercialisation. </p> <p>Rigetti said in 2018 that his group would build a computer within a year that employed 128 quantum bits, or qubits — a much larger system than anything then attempted, and an apparent sign that the technology was ready to be scaled up for practical use.</p> <p>That claim proved premature, and three months ago the company set a more modest goal of building an 80-qubit system by the end of 2021. Though smaller, Rigetti said the development marked a recent design breakthrough that put his company on a path to much more rapid advances in the coming years.</p> <p>“We have found a better way to scale,” Rigetti said in an interview with the Financial Times. The latest prediction is based on a modular design that involves linking a number of smaller quantum chips into a single processor, simplifying the job of getting a large number of qubits to work together.</p> <p>The company claimed the design gave it an edge over rivals, putting it on a path to build a 1,000 qubit system in 2024 and one based on 4,000 qubits in 2026. Its founder also predicted that it would be able to build a machine ten years from now with more computing power than all of today's cloud computing systems combined.</p> <p>However, company executives said the decision to go public now reflected a belief that early, more rudimentary versions of the technology would yield commercial benefits much sooner. “We believe we can get to customer value in a couple of years,” said Taryn Naidu, chief operating officer.</p> <p>Rigetti said it planned to go public early next year through a merger with Supernova Partners, a spac, or acquisition vehicle, co-chaired by hedge fund investor Alexander Klabin and Spencer Rascoff, a former chief executive of real estate site Zillow.</p> <p>The funding includes a $100m equity investment from investment groups that include T Rowe Price, Bessemer Venture Partners and Franklin Templeton. Other investors include In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, and Palantir, the data analytics company that has done extensive work for the national security establishment.</p> <p>While Wall Street's spac boom has opened a route for quantum computing companies to go public, stock market investors have yet to show real appetite for the technology. Shares in IonQ, a rival start-up, closed on Tuesday at $7.73, well below their $10 notional value at the time of the company's listing last week.</p><p>Source: Richard Waters in San Francisco 2021 'Quantum start-up Rigetti to go public in $450m spac deal  ' FT.com 6 October.
