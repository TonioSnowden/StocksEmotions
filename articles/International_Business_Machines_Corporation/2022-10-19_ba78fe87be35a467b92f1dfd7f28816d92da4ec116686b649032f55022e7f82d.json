  "text": "<p>All year, soaring inflation has dimmed the investing outlook, but better-than-expected quarterly results fromlarge U.S. banks had boosted stocks in recent sessions. A stream of mostly upbeat reportsfrom diverse companies Tuesday and Wednesday reinforced a sense that the business climate has held up well so far.</p><p>Still, anxiety about inflation and the Federal Reserve's response continued to preoccupy investors on Wednesday. The persistence of rising prices—which have consistently exceeded investors' expectations over the past year—makes strong earnings reports a double-edged sword.</p><p>\"I think the broader issue in this earnings season is really not just how companies are doing, but the macro issues with interest rates and Fed policy,\" said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office.</p><p>Signs that shoppers aren't ready to stop spending on dining, vacations and entertainment reinforce the case for more Fed interest-rate increases to come, which many investors think could cause a serious recession in the next year.</p><p>Inflation may reduce the central bank's perceived leeway to shift gears and ease policy again to cushion the economy when it does slow. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's computer model is estimating U.S. economic output rose at 2.9% in the third quarter, suggesting central bankers may not yet done enough to cool economic activity.</p><p>United Airlines' forecast for rising profit margins and resilient sales lifted airline shares Wednesday but also indicated that travel demand may continue to support higher ticket prices, said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investment at GuideStone Capital Management.</p><p>As higher rates bite, corporate performance could quickly slump across industries, he warned. \"I'm concerned that we're getting the very last amount of any good news out of a large majority of these companies,\" Mr. Pizzurro said.</p><p>United shares rose 5%.</p><p>Rising prices continue to scuttle investors' optimism, with more bad inflation news on Wednesday suggesting that global central banks will continue to raise interest rates. The U.K. reported 10.1% inflation year over year for September, underscoring a difficult path ahead for the Bank of England as it also navigates a series of fiscal-policy reversals by the British government.</p><p>Canada's annual inflation rate, likewise reported Wednesday, was 6.9% in September, slightly above what economists had forecast.</p><p>Yields on U.S. government debt, which largely reflect investors' expectations for benchmark interest rates through the maturity date, climbed on Wednesday. The 10-year yield rose to 4.127%, from 3.996% the day before. The two-year yield, more sensitive to short-term rate expectations, was at 4.55%, up from 4.435% on Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Yields have soared this year, slashing stock valuations by raising the competing returns offered by newly issued ultrasafe Treasurys. Attractive yields on cash-like government paper are making it harder to justify the traditional recession playbook of buying defensive stock sectors—especially because some of those sectors, such as utilities, look expensive right now, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Wealth.</p><p>Recently, Truist has been looking for value in industrial stocks, not a typical move with recession looming, Mr. Lerner said. On Wednesday, losses hit 10 of the S&amp;P's 11 sectors, with only energy stocks notching gains.</p><p>President Biden said Wednesday that he will consider additional releases of strategic oil reserves with the aim of lowering prices. Still, oil prices edged up, with global crude benchmark Brent climbing 2.6% to $92.41 a barrel.  </p><p>In other earnings news, Procter &amp; Gamble shares climbed 1% after the consumer-goods company lowered its outlook for full-year sales and itsquarterly earnings came in above Wall Street's estimates. Netflix jumped 13% after it said it gained2.4 million new subscribers last quarter, more than double the level it was expecting.</p><p>But Ally Financial, a major consumer lender, fell 7.9% after it reported a drop in earnings and said it set aside more funds in reserve against potential loan losses.</p><p>Tesla and IBM are expected to report earnings after markets close.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.5%. Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding gained 8.2% after reporting a narrower drop in profit last quarter, driven by record bookings.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks retreated. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 2.4%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Lower as Earnings, Inflation Figures Roll In</p>",
