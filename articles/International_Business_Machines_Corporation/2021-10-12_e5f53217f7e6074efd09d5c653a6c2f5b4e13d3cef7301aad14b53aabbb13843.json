Lenovo Group Ltd. retained the No. 1 spot, followed by HP Inc., which had its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in shipments driven by the weaker Chromebook demand in education, Gartner said. Dell Technologies Inc. was third and saw the largest year-over-year growth in unit shipments.</p><p>-- Maria Armental</p><p>---</p><p>EXXON MOBIL</p><p>Plastic-Recycling</p><p>Facility to Be Built</p><p>Exxon Mobil Corp. said it plans to build its first large-scale advanced recycling facility in Texas.</p><p>Exxon Mobil said it expects the plant at its Baytown complex near Houston to start operations by the end of next year, with an initial planned capacity to recycle 30,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually.</p><p>The company noted that a smaller, temporary facility is already producing commercial volumes of certified circular polymers that would be available by the end of 2021 to meet growing demand.</p><p>Exxon Mobil said it is developing plans to build about 500,000 metric tons of advanced recycling capacity around the world by 2026.
