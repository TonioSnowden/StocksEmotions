  "text": "<p>In his creative account of how to handle New Zealand's boom in house prices, Ruchir Sharma (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8959502-7dae-43b1-b993-3bf85fb4325a\">Opinion</a>, March 15) endorses adding housing price stability to the remit of central banks. This is a mistake. The target variable is credit expansion, not the outcome of higher housing prices. Bubbles are fuelled by easy money as Hyman Minsky observed decades ago. Central banks need to focus on the causes of price surges not the outcomes in specific markets. </p> <p>There is clearly room to improve measures of inflation that exclude housing costs. However, the answer to New Zealand's housing price surge is to be found in fiscal not monetary policy. Providing tax breaks for those in the income distribution who cannot afford housing is a preferable instrument to deal with inequality; putting housing prices into the objective function of the central bank is not. </p> <p>Central banks have already seen their remits enlarged during the pandemic, and further additions to their policy targets are not helpful. Even worse, it is more likely to confuse than help them focus on their core goals of price stability and economic activity. </p> <p><strong>Danny Leipziger</strong> <br><em>Professor of International Business <br>George Washington University <br>Washington, DC, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Central banks do not need a house price mandate too' FT.com 17 March.
