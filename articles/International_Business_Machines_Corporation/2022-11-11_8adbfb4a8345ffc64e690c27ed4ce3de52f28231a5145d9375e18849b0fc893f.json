  "title": "Japan Sets Up Advanced Chip Business With Toyota, Sony; Production of next-generation chips targeted by the late 2020s as Japan lags behind other nations",
  "text": "<p>Toyota Motor Corp., Sony Group Corp., and chip companies Kioxia Holdings Corp. and Tokyo Electron Ltd., as well as SoftBank Group Corp., have contributed the equivalent of about $7 million each to create the venture, the Japanese government said Friday. The government pledged to provide about $500 million in subsidies.</p><p>A research center for the new business will be set up this year, the government said.</p><p>\"As the struggle for control of technology between the U.S. and China intensifies, the importance of semiconductors is increasing from the perspective of economic security,\" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said.</p><p>Japan, once a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, has fallen far behind the U.S. and Taiwan. Tokyo sees that as a national security concern as well as a problem for local manufacturers, especially car makers that will increasingly rely on advanced chip technologies as they work to develop features such as autonomous driving.</p><p>The investment in Rapidus is smaller than the tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditure by advanced chip makers in a single year. The world's biggest contract chip maker is expected to spend $36 billion this year alone.</p><p>Rapidus President Atsuyoshi Koike said the company would work with U.S. businesses and groups including tech giant International Business Machines Corp. to research and develop semiconductors of next-generation 2-nanometer technology and beyond.</p><p>Japan is still a leading force when it comes to manufacturing skills \"and I feel that this is our last chance,\" Mr. Koike said, speaking in a briefing Friday.</p><p>The group will work on a preliminary design for a pilot production line over the next few months, it said. Rapidus aims to begin operating as a contract manufacturer producing logic chips after an initial research period.</p><p>Major economies like the U.S. and China are pouring in government money to enhance domestic chip production, which they see as geopolitically critical. The U.S. Congress passed legislation with $52.7 billion in direct financial assistance for building and expanding chip factories as well as other programs. Meanwhile China has spent billions of dollars in recent years to try to catch up to the world's most advanced chip makers, though it has yet to succeed.</p><p>For Toyota, Sony and others, the new business is aimed at helping to diversify and strengthen their chip supply chains. Companies globally have been grappling with a shortage of semiconductors since late 2020, when pandemic-driven demand for electronics clashed with an abrupt rebound in demand for cars.</p><p>Earlier this month, Toyota trimmed its annual production target for cars by 500,000 vehicles citing the risk of continuing semiconductor shortages. Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. cut their unit sales forecasts for the fiscal year ending March, also citing shortages.</p><p>The clash between the U.S. and China over chips has further heightened companies' concerns about their ability to secure stable supplies.</p><p>Toyota aims to become more involved in its chip supply chain—working directly on processes like circuit design that have in the past typically been handled by semiconductor companies, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>As cars shift to become electric, autonomous and internet-connected, the performance and procurement of semiconductors is becoming increasingly important, a spokeswoman for Toyota said.</p><p>The U.S. and allies including Japan have grown concerned about the rise of China's semiconductor industry, as well as the concentration of advanced chip making in Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory.</p><p>Currently only chip juggernauts like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. have the finances and technological prowess to manufacture the most sophisticated chips. The Taiwanese and South Korean companies introduced mass-production technology for 3-nanometer chips this year and plan to mass-produce 2-nanometer ones in 2025.</p><p>Last December, Japanese lawmakers approved the equivalent of $5.2 billion in funding aimed at rebuilding the domestic semiconductor industry, which had been globally dominant in the 1980s but declined over the years as it faced competition from Taiwanese and South Korean players. The move is part of Tokyo's goal to increase domestic chip revenue to the equivalent of nearly $100 billion by 2030, roughly triple the figure in 2020. The budget includes billions of dollars in subsidies for domestic leading-edge chip manufacturing.</p><p>—Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com and River Davis at river.davis@wsj.com</p><p>Japan Sets Up Advanced Chip Business With Toyota, Sony</p>",
