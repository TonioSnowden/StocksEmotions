  "text": "<p>Good morning. Joe Biden is to announce the sale of more oil from the government's strategic reserves in a speech later today addressing rising costs. </p> <p>The US president will also outline a plan to replenish the dwindling emergency stockpile in an effort to tame petrol prices, which have been a political liability for Democrats ahead of next month's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-midterm-elections\">midterm elections</a>.</p> <p>In March, Biden ordered the release of 180mn barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which led to a surge in energy prices and a scramble for supplies. The latest release of 15mn barrels from the SPR completes the president's target <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0600d0d8-4f66-4f88-bda5-af21b1966b0d\">but leaves reserves at their lowest level since 1984</a>.</p> <p>The latest intervention in the energy market by the White House follows the decision by Opec and its allies last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5eaea58f-d04f-40d6-aae5-f0b39ab324c0\">to cut oil production</a>, a move that angered Washington.</p> <p>The US government's decision to lean on the SPR to bring down domestic petrol prices has come under fire from Republicans, who argue reserves have fallen to dangerously low levels.</p> <p>Yesterday the White House responded to some of these criticisms by announcing a new mechanism that will be used to replenish supplies. </p> <p>Under the new arrangement the SPR would purchase oil if it fell to between $67 and $72 per barrel in spot transactions, but would also enter into contracts to purchase oil based on its forward price in the futures market. US oil prices rose to $83.50 ahead of Biden's announcement.</p> <p><em>Do you think Joe Biden is correct to sell oil reserves to help lower prices?

The company's shares surged as much as 15.5 per cent in after-hours trading.</p> <p><strong>2. UK inflation rate hits double figures</strong> UK inflation rose to 10.1 per cent, putting pressure on the government's stretched finances and on the Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dec290b0-dc52-4486-81c7-2173188e281b\">to announce a large interest rate increase</a> at its next meeting in November.
