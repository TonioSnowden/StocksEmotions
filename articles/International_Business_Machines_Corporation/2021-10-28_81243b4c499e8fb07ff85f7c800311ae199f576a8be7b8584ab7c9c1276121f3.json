  "text": "<p>Their firm, Ruder Finn, now has about 800 employees at 19 offices in four countries.</p><p>Mr. Finn, who died Oct. 18 at the age of 100, was an unconventional PR man.</p><p>In books, articles and interviews, he scolded chief executives for being intolerant of criticism, obsessed with profits and insufficiently dedicated to improving the world.</p><p>PR firms couldn't stifle criticism of corporations and shouldn't try, he argued, urging companies to listen to their critics and respond constructively. Nor could public relations \"invent new personalities or fashion images out of thin air,\" he wrote. \"Our job is to help people define their character and establish their identity.\"</p><p>To pass the time during meetings, Mr. Finn made sculptures out of paper clips. He made himself an expert in photographing sculptures, and his photography was featured in more than 100 books.</p><p>\"I'm afraid I probably deserve the reputation of not being a very hardheaded businessman,\" he told The Wall Street Journal in 1986. \"The bottom line isn't my highest priority.\"</p><p>Ruder Finn, plagued at times by sloppy financial management, sometimes ran short of cash.</p><p>Some executives missed a paycheck in 1984 and weren't fully repaid for more than a year. But Mr. Finn and his colleagues managed to pull things together and preserve the firm.</p><p>He wrote that CEOs should consider writing their own speeches, even though speechwriting was part of the PR revenue stream. Executives might become better leaders, he said, if they \"could make the time to struggle with words like the rest of us.\"</p><p>In the 1980s, three of his children rose to senior positions in the company. Some high-level executives, seeing their prospects for promotion limited at what had become a family-controlled firm, left to join rivals or set up their own companies. Mr. Finn insisted that his children were promoted because of their excellent work. One of his daughters, Kathy Bloomgarden, has served as chief executive of Ruder Finn since 2014.</p><p>His children were committed to keeping the firm independent, Mr. Finn said in a 2000 interview with PR Week. \"When times were not so good, they did not run out and seek a buyer,\" he said.</p><p>He was born as David Finkelstein in New York on Aug. 30, 1921. His father, a writer, later changed the family name to Finn. His mother did sales and marketing work for a family-owned dressmaking business.</p><p>David Finn met William Ruder in the early 1930s at Hebrew classes. While riding the New York subway, young David sketched other passengers. He wrote and drew for student publications. At City College, he majored in English. Toward the end of World War II, he briefly worked for the Army News Service in New York.</p><p>Mr. Finn's younger sister, Helen, married Mr. Ruder. Mr. Finn married Laura Zeisler, who was a student at Hunter College. Though his wife thought he should be seeking a job, Mr. Finn started writing a novel. After three months, he gave up and accepted work as a salesman for a maker of Christmas cards.</p><p>Messrs. Finn and Ruder started their company from an office in what had been a linen closet in a Manhattan hotel. To promote Perry Como's records, they organized contests with prizes including autographed cigarette lighters and trips to Lake Como in Italy.</p><p>Their success in promoting Mr. Como and other singers led to work with big companies, including eventually International Business Machines Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. They won publicity for Lever Brothers' No-Rinse Surf detergent by arranging for Boy Scouts to wash busts of Abraham Lincoln on his birthday.</p><p>In the 1950s, they were hired to promote the Pres-A-Lite, a device that dispensed lit cigarettes inside automobiles. Ruder Finn set up a fake romance and legal dispute over whether a young woman had to return the Pres-A-Lite her former boyfriend had given her. Stories and pictures appeared in the press.</p><p>Later, the young man and woman who had participated in the hoax said it had damaged their reputations. On the advice of lawyers, Ruder Finn made a payment to settle their complaint. It was \"one of the most embarrassing adventures in our careers,\" Mr. Finn wrote in a 1998 memoir, \"The Way Forward.\"</p><p>Most assignments were less frivolous. During the Kennedy administration, the White House hired Ruder Finn to drum up public support for a nuclear test ban treaty. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ruder Finn developed the ready.gov website for disaster information.</p><p>At a press conference organized for another client, Mr. Finn was horrified to find that no reporters had shown up. \"In desperation, I called our office and asked one of our executives to come and pose as an editor,\" he wrote. Mr. Finn vowed never to call a press conference again unless it was clear that at least a few journalists would attend.</p><p>Working for Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, made some of the firm's employees uncomfortable as awareness of the health risks of smoking grew. After lengthy discussions, Mr. Finn wrote, \"we came to the conclusion that working on projects that were good for society as well as for the company was ethically responsible.\"</p><p>Mr. Finn is survived by his wife, four children, 10 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.</p><p>He made a series of 108 paintings inspired by T.S. Eliot's \"Four Quartets.\" They were published as a book. Though he wasn't a full-time artist, Mr. Finn didn't want to be seen as a mere hobbyist. \"I didn't paint to pass the time away,\" he wrote. \"Painting was at the core of my being.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
