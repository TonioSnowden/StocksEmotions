  "title": "Microsoft Earnings Fall, Stock Slides as PC Demand and Strong Dollar Hurt Sales; Software giant predicts further slowdown as cloud growth slows and Windows sales slip",
  "text": "<p>It was the worst quarterly net income decline Microsoft has reported in more than two years and the weakest revenue growth in over five years.</p><p>Sales of Microsoft's Windows operating system fell by 15% during the quarter, the company said. Sales of PCs, a large portion of which use Windows, have fallen this year after booming at the onset of the pandemic. The company's Azure cloud-computing platform and other cloud services posted a 35% rise in revenue, although the pace of its growth has slowed in the past year.</p><p>The company is expecting further sluggishness ahead, reporting an outlook for the current quarter that was well below Wall Street forecasts, driven by even sharper declines in sales of PCs and tablets. Azure's growth also is expected to slow on a currency-adjusted basis, financial chief Amy Hood said on a conference call about the results.</p><p>Windows sales to PC makers are expected to drop more than  30% in the quarter, Ms. Hood said. The company's sales outlook for the current quarter, she said, was for as much as $53.35 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting $56.16 billion.</p><p>Microsoft shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading after it announced its results.</p><p>The software giant, which gets the lion's share of its sales from businesses, is doing better than tech companies which depend more on consumer spending and advertising. However, demand for its Windows operating system software has slipped alongside the sales of the personal computers which use it. Around the world households, companies and governments that purchased computers during the pandemic are scaling back.</p><p>Global shipments of desktop and laptop computers fell in the third quarter by 18% from a year earlier, according to a recent report by market-research firm Canalys. Notebook shipments were particularly hard hit, the technology-analysis firm said.</p><p>Microsoft is also a top player in cloud-computing services that have boomed during the pandemic. In the middle of the health crisis, Microsoft reported several straight quarters of 50% or more year-over-year sales growth for Azure, the world's No. 2 behind Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud.</p><p>The pace of growth has moderated this year, however. Revenue growth at Azure and its other cloud services slowed to 35% in the most recent quarter from 50% a year earlier.</p><p>As businesses grapple with high inflation, rising interest rates and economic worries, Microsoft says they use its software and cloud services more for efficiency and flexibility.</p><p>\"Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today,\" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said on the earnings call Tuesday. </p><p>Fluctuations in the dollar's value also have made Microsoft's numbers look worse, and Ms. Hood said the currency would continue to be a factor in its current quarter.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's performance against other currencies, is up nearly 15% since the beginning of the year. Microsoft gets close to half of its sales overseas, and a strong dollar means the money it earns in foreign currency translates into fewer dollars.</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. has had to contend with many of the same trends and last weekposted higher-than-expected sales for the third quarter. It cited continued strong demand for its cloud-computing services and artificial intelligence products.</p><p>Microsoft shares have fallen around 25% so far this year, slightly better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index which has slipped 28%.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook for Microsoft? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Earlier this month Microsoft said it was laying off employees to adjust to evolving business prospects. It didn't say how many people it was cutting. In July the software maker said it had plans to cut positions, affecting less than 1% of its total workforce of more than 200,000 people.</p><p>Videogames and Microsoft's Xbox videogame consoles are an increasingly important business for the company. The videogaming industry in general is going through a slowdown as the winding down of the pandemic means people are spending less time at home. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox revenue decreased by 3% in its most recent quarter.</p><p>Still, Microsoft has made a huge bet on the sector with its $75 billion plan to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. Regulators around the world are scrutinizing the deal and the company said it expects the deal to close by the end of next June.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Earnings Fall, Stock Slides as PC Demand and Strong Dollar Hurt Sales</p>",
