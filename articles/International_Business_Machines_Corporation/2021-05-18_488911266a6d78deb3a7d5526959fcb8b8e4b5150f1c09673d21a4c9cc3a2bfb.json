  "title": "Mayo Clinic, Others Use ‘AI Factories' to Speed AI Development; Healthcare provider is among organizations taking an assembly-line approach to quickly create targeted AI applications",
  "text": "<p>\"It's [a] more consistent process to produce algorithms,\" Mr. Buntrock said.</p><p>One application in development aims to analyze medical images to identify and classify \"biomarkers\"—measurable medical signs, such as excess abdominal fat—which could help predict patient health. Mr. Buntrock declined to quantify the speed and cost savings of the AI factory effort, but said they are significant.</p><p>The main reason companies are turning to the AI factory model is to increase their success rate with AI, said Erick Brethenoux, a vice president analyst at technology research and advisory firm Gartner Inc.</p><p>Common processes and tools allow teams to learn them quickly and share best practices on how to use them, which can substantially reduce the time and cost of building applications, Mr. Brethenoux said. The goal is to put proven techniques and technologies in the hands of teams of business users and AI specialists building applications for specific use cases, he said.</p><p>The concept is picking up speed, Mr. Brethenoux said. Organizations have accumulated significant data, which is needed to train AI algorithms, and a wider variety of AI development tools are available to tap those repositories.</p><p>As the economy shows signs of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, companies are looking to expand their use of AI to enhance the customer experience, increase sales and improve operations. Today, only about half of AI projects make it from pilot to production, according to Gartner. Barriers include issues with data integration and data volume and complexity, as well as a dearth of technology knowledge.</p><p>While limiting teams to a narrow set of procedures and tools wouldn't be ideal for developing an enterprise-wide AI system, the approach can systematize the development of targeted applications.</p><p>\"Just like a physical factory creates physical products, an AI factory should be able to deliver AI solutions in a systematic way,\" said John Thomas, a distinguished engineer and director at International Business Machines Corp.</p><p>At Mayo, teams from neurology, radiology, pathology and other departments that have a concept for a new AI application team up with the health provider's data scientists, machine-learning engineers and other AI specialists to develop the idea.</p><p>The teams use agile management, a common software-development methodology in which participants break development into small tasks, develop various functions and features in short sprints and quickly adjust if something isn't working or if a better idea surfaces.</p><p>Mayo teams use common data and software-development platforms, including Google Cloud and Google 's TensorFlow, for building machine-learning applications.</p><p>The teams also use a set of computer languages, such as Python, one of the most common AI coding languages, and software-development collaboration tools.</p><p>Another user of the AI factory model is Wunderman Thompson , a New York-based marketing agency that is a unit of advertising company WPP PLC .</p><p>At Wunderman Thompson , the number of AI factory pilots, proofs of concept and developed applications is growing, said Cleve Gibbon, the company's chief technology officer for North America.</p><p>Teams of marketing and advertising experts work with AI specialists who use agile project management. A team recently developed an application called Resolve, which uses machine learning to analyze client data and make predictions on their interests, which Wunderman Thompson clients can use to design marketing campaigns.</p><p>Dr. Gibbon said the company has shown double-digit percentage improvements in both the speed of developing applications and cost savings.</p><p>\"It's a matter of building a hypothesis and having the means and the processes to actually take it from ideation all the way through to impact—at scale and at speed,\" he said.</p><p>Write to John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.com</p>",
