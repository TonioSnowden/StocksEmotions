  "text": "<p>Major financial firms kicked off a bumper week of earnings reports Monday.

Charles Schwab and IBM will report later in the day. Companies due to provide updates later this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday and Twitter on Friday.</p><p>Synchrony Financial rose 3% after reporting earnings per share that fell on the year but were better than analysts had expected.</p><p>Investors are trying to reconcile a dire economic outlook with still relatively positive earnings forecasts. Economic growth is showing signs of slowing while inflation is soaring, last week reaching a fresh four-decade high. Meanwhile, central banks are raising interest rates rapidly, adding another cloud on the economy's horizon. So far, corporate reports have been lackluster.</p><p>\"It feels like something is wrong: Either the economic story is wrong or analysts are being too optimistic on earnings, and it feels like the latter,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"If you scrape the text of company earnings announcements, many are complaining.\"</p><p>Data due Monday are expected to show declining confidence among U.S. home builders as mortgage rates are rising. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the National Association of Home Builders to report a seventh consecutive month of declining confidence in July.</p><p>The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years at a meeting Thursday.
