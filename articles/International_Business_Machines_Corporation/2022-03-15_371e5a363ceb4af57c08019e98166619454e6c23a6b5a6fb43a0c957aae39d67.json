  "text": "<p>The “policymakers' nasty dilemma”, as described by Chris Giles (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36c76a56-3431-4ced-8a05-a7a904bc348b\">Opinion</a>, March 4), is indeed difficult when countries are confronted with slower growth and increasing inflation (aptly termed stagflation). However, the answer is to try and influence the underlying economic fundamentals and thereby shift expectations.</p> <p>First off, on the anti-inflation front, it matters whether the cause is excessive demand — the Covid pent-up demand argument — or, more likely, a combination of supply chain problems, food price increases and now energy price surges. </p> <p>If it's the latter, then raising interest rates by itself will not do the trick unless raised to very high levels, when they might actually affect investment.</p> <p>The more direct way means getting oil producers, annoyed by the climate change issue, to nevertheless increase production. It means Germany needs to re-examine its anti-nuclear energy policy, admittedly a long-run answer. It means putting more effort into fixing the problems of logistics and shipping. It means altering inflationary expectations by dealing with the supply side.</p> <p>Giles argues that the job “of managing the cycle and the trade-off between the inflationary and contractionary effects of this crisis in the UK and elsewhere should fall to central banks”. In fact, what we learned from the pandemic is that there was an over-reliance on central banks and, at least in the US, an unacceptably slow reversal of quantitative easing. </p> <p>We shouldn't make the same mistake with respect to stagflation and assume central banks are the primary answer. Their efforts are important for signalling; however, unless inflation is driven by excessive investment, which isn't the case, their raising rates may not damp investment much, since underlying expectations are already weak.</p> <p>The essential answer to stagflation lies in the management of expectations and this is both a political challenge, as recent events have shown, as well as an economic one. Gradual shifts in monetary policy will not do the trick. Neither will fiscal tinkering. </p> <p>The solution to stagflation may well end up being less a product of policymakers' nimbleness and more a result of political decisions and co-ordinated economic leadership.</p> <p><strong>Danny Leipziger</strong> <br><em>Professor of International Business<br>George Washington University<br>Managing Director, Growth Dialogue Washington, DC, US</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Leaders require co-ordinated response to beat stagflation' FT.com 15 March.
