  "title": "MANSION  ---  Private Properties:  Florida-Bound Financier  Lists Greenwich Estate  ----  By Katherine Clarke",
  "text": "<p>   A waterfront Greenwich, Conn., estate built on land once owned by the late former IBM chief Thomas Watson Jr., is coming on the market for $55 million. </p><p>   The sellers are Brett Barakett, founder and chief executive of Tremblant Capital, a global-asset management fund, and his wife Meaghan Barakett. Mr. Barakett purchased the land in 2005 from the estate of Olive Watson, Mr. Watson's wife, and replaced a 1950s-era house with a Georgian-style stone mansion, according to listing agents Joseph Barbieri and Leslie McElwreath of Sotheby's International Realty. </p><p>   Mr. Barakett is the latest in a string of financiers from the Northeast of the country to head south. He is selling because he and his wife are relocating to South Florida, where they can be close to an office his company is opening in West Palm Beach, his agents said. </p><p>   Located in tony Field Point Circle, which was formerly a horse track in the 1900s, the roughly 2 1/2-acre estate has 340 feet of private coastline on the Long Island Sound, an 180-foot stone jetty and a deep-water dock. The agents said the dock is unusual even among the most valuable estates in Greenwich. </p><p>   The grounds include an outdoor pool overlooking the Sound, a sports court with an in-ground basketball hoop, vegetable gardens, fruit-tree orchards, a chicken coop and an electric-vehicle charging station. </p><p>   The main house, designed by Shope Reno Wharton, a Connecticut architecture firm known for merging modern and traditional, has eight bedrooms, a formal living and dining room area, a yoga studio and a home gym. There is also an indoor 60-foot pool surrounded by dramatic classical columns. The Baraketts were married at the home in 2016, according to their agents. </p><p>   The Greenwich market has benefited over the past year from a wave of buyers coming from New York City in search of more space. Home sales were up 141% in Greenwich in the fourth quarter, according to a recent report by Douglas Elliman. </p><p></p>",
