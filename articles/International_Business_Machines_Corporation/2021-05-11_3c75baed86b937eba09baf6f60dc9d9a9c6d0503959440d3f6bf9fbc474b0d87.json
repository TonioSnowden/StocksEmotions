But it turns out some legal strategies are best left in the locker.&#xa0;</p> <p>So it is for ex-Paul Weiss lawyer<strong> Alex Oh</strong>, whose advocacy for longtime client <strong>ExxonMobil </strong>landed her in hot water with a district judge and triggered her resignation as enforcement chief at the <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> after just six days.&#xa0;</p> <p>Oh was installed at the markets regulator by SEC head <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1912d176-cc8a-4871-a033-691f3b91ae05\"><strong>Gary Gensler</strong></a> in April. She had barely taken out her pencils when a judge found her partly responsible for the “misconduct” of an Exxon witness in a deposition hearing whose details were revealed for the first time on Friday —&#xa0;as the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82eb07d7-9493-45ac-98c0-b705ccdd66a2\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Oh had represented the oil company for more than a decade in a 21-year case brought by Indonesian villagers. The plaintiffs claim Exxon hired private security personnel to guard its Aceh province natural gas plant who raped, tortured and killed villagers and their families.</p> <p>“We have fought these baseless claims <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61f928ba-a6de-11db-83e4-0000779e2340\">for many years</a>,” Exxon told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>In February<strong> Mark Snell</strong>, the oil company's general counsel for the Asia-Pacific region, was giving evidence in a remote deposition organised on Zoom. Oh represented Exxon, while Snell faced questions from lawyer <strong>Kit Pierson</strong> on behalf of the villagers.&#xa0;</p> <p>What happened next was spelt out in lurid detail in an opinion from <strong>Judge Royce Lamberth</strong> unsealed last week.&#xa0;</p> <p>According to Lamberth, Snell failed to properly answer 100 questions. In response to one yes-or-no question, he gave a 398-word answer. Lamberth said that amounted to misconduct, and found evidence suggesting that Oh and Snell had jointly planned the evasive strategy.</p> <p>The plaintiffs said Paul Weiss should be punished as a result.&#xa0;</p> <p>There were also complaints made by Paul Weiss lawyers about Pierson's behaviour during the hearing, saying he had engaged in “browbeating” and become “unhinged”. </p> <p>But Zoom hearings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnnI6HD6DU\">can be replayed</a>.&#xa0;When Lamberth watched the hearing back, he found that Pierson “maintained a calm demeanour. That includes moments when [Oh] accused him . . . of being unprofessional or shouting.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In an explanation filed with the court, Oh said she “genuinely believed when I made those assertions that my descriptions were supported by my own recollection, the transcript and the video of the deposition”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The incident highlights the tension between Paul Weiss' efforts to cultivate a public image as a champion of social justice, and the demands of its day job as a corporate law firm.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I suppose there may be some cost to being so visible in the social justice arena, though that would be a shame,” Brad Karp told an industry publication last week.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, Lamberth is weighing whether he should impose penalties on the firm for very different reasons.&#xa0;</p> <h2>A trophy Manchester United could win: least popular leveraged buyout</h2> <p><strong>Manchester United</strong> fans this month showed their anger at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">Super League fiasco</a> by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a083a4e-8f29-4f0c-9277-b8bcf8c48ccf\">storming the pitch</a> at the club's Old Trafford ground.&#xa0;</p> <p>But their unhappiness with the club's owners goes back much further. It started in 2005 when the American billionaire <strong>Glazer family</strong> bought Manchester United in a £790m leveraged buyout.</p> <p>Years later, the effects of that buyout have become clear, as the FT's Murad Ahmed, Patrick Mathurin and Chris Campbell show in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f52a13bf-a772-47d9-9378-6146532c02d9\">this data-rich story.</a>&#xa0;</p> <p>First, the deal saddled the club with debt — which has left it stumping up cash for interest payments.&#xa0;</p> <p>Fans would rather see that money spent on modernising its stadium, developing its youth academy and improving its squad.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Glazer family also extracted millions of pounds in dividends, which is rare in football. Check out this chart comparing its financing and dividend costs to <strong>Liverpool</strong>'s.&#xa0;</p> <p>Second, even as it has taken on those financial burdens, Manchester United's sponsorship revenues have slipped in recent years. Its new shirt-sponsor deal with <strong>TeamViewer</strong> is worth less per season than its current one with <strong>Chevrolet</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>And third, even though it has spent huge sums on new signings, that hasn't translated into Premier League victories. The club hasn't won the title since 2013 despite having one of the highest wage bills in the league.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an open letter to fans last week, chair <strong>Joel Glazer</strong> offered a “sincere apology” for its Super League decision. Fans, including the thousands forced to sell their shares to the Glazers in a compulsory buyout, may feel he has more than that to say sorry for.&#xa0;</p> <p>For more business of sports coverage, sign up to the FT's weekly Scoreboard briefing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Kamensky headed to jail for manipulating Neiman Marcus bankruptcy</h2> <p><strong>Dan Kamensky</strong> had hoped that his lectures at law and business schools about the lessons of his misconduct would continue this autumn.&#xa0;</p> <p>He might need to reschedule them.</p> <p>The prominent US hedge fund manager was sentenced to six months in prison on Friday, a term set to begin in June, for his misconduct during the 2020 bankruptcy of luxury retailer <strong>Neiman Marcus</strong>.</p> <p>The founder of <strong>Marble Ridge Capital</strong> pleaded guilty earlier this year to a single count of bankruptcy fraud after being arrested by the FBI at his home in September.&#xa0;He&#xa0;admitted to corrupting the outcome of Neiman's bankruptcy last July by trying to derail an attempt by US investment bank <strong>Jefferies </strong>to buy illiquid shares of the retailer so that he could acquire them more cheaply.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bloomberg chat messages and a secretly recorded phone call documented his treachery over that one day.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD's Sujeet Indap was in the lower Manhattan courthouse on Friday when Kamensky was given his punishment by <strong>Judge Denise Cote</strong> of the Southern District of New York. Read his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a2a2e7d-f671-4b07-af8b-9b0d43ef6576\">story here</a>.</p> <p>The 48-year-old former corporate lawyer argued that he should be spared prison for among other reasons, his charitable acts and a crime which happened in the heat of the moment.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prosecutors had wanted 12-18 months per sentencing guidelines. Kamensky also received a sentence of six months of home confinement and a $55,000 fine.</p> <p>In his remarks in court to the judge, Kamensky said: “Nothing can change what happened that day. The only thing I can do is own it.”</p> <p>It is a lesson of accountability, but one that students will not hear in person for some time.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>TPG</strong> co-founder <strong>James Coulter</strong> has relinquished his role as co-chief executive of the investment manager, leaving <strong>Jon Winkelried</strong>, the former<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> banker who has shared the top job since 2015, in sole charge of the $91bn firm.
