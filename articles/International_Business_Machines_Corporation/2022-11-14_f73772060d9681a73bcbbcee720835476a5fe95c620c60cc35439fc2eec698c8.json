  "title": "Who Wants Joan Didion's Old Stuff? Fans Younger Than Ever; The author's estate sale, held nearly a year after her death, has sent generations of Didionites on pilgrimages to Hudson, N.Y., to see—and touch—her personal effects",
  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, a stack of 13 ordinary blank notebooks, valued below $200, will also fetch thousands. Ms. Didion, who died last December at the age of 87, has inspired generations of writers and thinkers to observe and document the world with clarity and style. Now, many of those Didionites are vying for a piece of her legacy.</p><p>Held by Stair Galleries in Hudson, N.Y., and organized by Ms. Didion's heirs to benefit Parkinson's research at Columbia University, along with a Sacramento City College scholarship, the auction puts a price tag on the icon's possessions after six decades in the public eye. It contains 224 lots and will close on Nov. 16, when final bids are placed online or by phone.</p><p>A week before the auction's closing date, co-curator Lisa Thomas said fans have been visiting the gallery \"as a sort of a pilgrimage.\" Unlike at a museum exhibition, visitors are allowed to sit down at Ms. Didion's desk and punch out a few sentences on her IBM Wheelwriter 5 typewriters—\"There were no computers that we saw in the apartment,\" Ms. Thomas said—or rest for a spell on the white slipcovered sofas. The only off-limits items are the books, which have become fragile with age (particularly the Hemingway titles).</p><p>Since the preview opened on Oct. 31, the gallery has welcomed thousands of visitors. \"Several people have become very, very emotional,\" Ms. Thomas said, \"all writers, I think, who just really identified with her in the way that she looked to Hemingway.\"</p><p>Ms. Didion's audience seems to be getting younger, according to her estate's spokesperson, the literary publicist Paul Bogaards. Data provided by Bookshop.org shows a 27% increase in year-over-year sales for Ms. Didion's titles among readers aged 18 and 45. Half her Facebook community falls within the age bracket. And on TikTok, #joandidion has been used more than 14 million times.</p><p>Carrie Courogen, a 31-year-old writer, plans to bid on a 37-piece Spode dinner service that, so far, is among the auction's more affordable lots. She's waiting until the final hours because she is terrified of getting caught up in the thrill of competition and spending too much.</p><p>\"Part of me is like, 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime, incredibly special thing—live a little!'\" Ms. Courogen said. \"And the more responsible part of me is like, 'Oh no, baby, what are you doing?'\"</p><p>Na Kim, the art director of The Paris Review, had her eye on Ms. Didion's Limoges fish service before bids rose. Mitzi Angel, the president and publisher of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, has a friend \"who was very annoyed that she didn't get the writing desk,\" she said. Earlier this year, the publishing house renewed its licenses to publish \"The White Album,\" \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\" and \"Play It As It Lays.\" Licenses are granted by copyright owners—authors or their estates—for set lengths of time.</p><p>\"In this instance, renewal licenses for those books were avidly sought by FSG and Knopf, Ms. Didion's longtime publishers, and in the end, FSG won out,\" Ms. Didion's agent Lynn Nesbit wrote in an email.</p><p>Among the items in the estate sale, Ms. Didion's blank Moleskine notebooks are perhaps the most talked-about, according to Ms. Thomas, who added bookplates saying \"From the Library of Joan Didion\" \"to brand them.\"</p><p>\"Down the line, when people are reselling things, they can't say that they bought it at the Didion auction if it doesn't have one of our bookplates in it,\" she said.</p><p>Author Cara Blue Adams felt melancholy when she visited the galleries: \"Those objects felt stripped of her animating presence, if that makes sense, in a way that made me feel the weight of her loss.\" But it was comforting, she added, to see the author's copies of Hemingway, Wallace Stevens and Renata Adler, plus work by female artists including Helen Marden and Vija Celmins.</p><p>From the time Ms. Didion splashed onto the scene in her early 20s with a 1961 Vogue essay on self-respect, she has inspired women to express themselves with confidence.</p><p>\"As young female writers, we're always risking melodrama, sentimentality,\" said \"Sweetbitter\" author Stephanie Danler. \"And we read Didion and we see that she's a writer who magically appears to be free of those derogatory feminine qualities.\"</p><p>Thanks to social media, Ms. Didion is now known for her image as well as her prose. Just a few years ago, the not-for-purchase Literary Hub bag bearing her likeness was considered an insider status tote. (It has since become available for purchase, and Jonny Diamond, the outlet's editor in chief, said there are 10,000 totes in circulation to date.)</p><p>\"People coming to Joan Didion are more likely to see a photograph of her than they are to start reading her books without that context,\" said Ms. Danler, who started reading Didion as a teenager in the '90s, long before the author's photo was getting reblogged on Tumblr.</p><p>Regarding book sales, Ms. Angel said, \"we saw a major bump in 2020, which is interesting because that was before her death.\" The spike was significant enough that Ms. Angel hesitates to ascribe it to pandemic backlist reading. At the New York City bookstore McNally Jackson, \"The Year of Magical Thinking,\" \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\" and \"Play It As It Lays\" haven't left the top 50 bestsellers in years.</p><p>In her nonfiction books, Ms. Didion occasionally referred to the outfits, accessories and ephemera that filled her life: A minimalistic packing list included in \"The White Album\" has been pored over by superfans seeking to emulate her light carry-on. Most of those items—the two skirts, the nightgown, the mohair throw—are notably absent from the auction. (Ms. Didion's family has taken on the task of emptying her closets, per Ms. Thomas.) And, according to Mr. Bogaards, \"things were not Joan's thing.\"</p><p>\"If the world is placing a premium on those objects, it's because they hold her work in such high regard,\" he said.</p><p>Who Wants Joan Didion's Old Stuff?
