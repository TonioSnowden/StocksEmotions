  "text": "<p>   Dish Network Corp. tapped International Business Machines Corp. to help manage its coming 5G network, a move it sees as key to luring enterprise customers to its wireless business. </p><p>   The longtime satellite-TV company plans for its new 5G network to cover at least 20% of the U.S. population by next summer. It has teamed up with more than 35 companies to build the network. </p><p>   The terms of Dish's multiyear contract with IBM weren't disclosed. </p><p>   Dish jumped into the U.S. wireless industry in 2019, purchasing about 9 million former Sprint Corp. customers as part of a government-brokered deal that allowed T-Mobile US Inc. to acquire Sprint. Dish's consumer cellphone brands include Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless. </p><p>   Dish has been obtaining 5G spectrum airwaves for years with ambitions of being a formidable competitor in the wireless sector. </p><p>   Chief Network Officer Marc Rouanne said Dish could target a number of industries, including logistics and healthcare. He declined to say what kinds of companies are testing Dish's 5G service and when it would become generally available. </p><p>   IBM will provide what is known as orchestration software, technology that helps network providers manage and automate how they deliver 5G services, including fine-tuning speed levels or coverage areas for specific customers. For instance, an autonomous-car operator might need low latency, or quick response times, for fleets of cars in certain cities, while an energy company might be fine with slower response times over a broader coverage area. </p><p></p>",
