  "title": "Motive Partners Raises New Fund's Upper Limit to $2 Billion; Firm increased the fund's cap from $1.5 billion after gaining investor approval, people familiar with the matter say",
  "text": "<p>\"They're raising the [hard] cap in response to the scale, velocity and quality of deal flow and they've routinely accessed co-investment capital for the same reasons,\" a Motive fund investor said.</p><p>Deals by private-equity firms involving U.S. technology businesses totaled $411.16 billion last year, according to data provider Dealogic, or more than twice the $196.88 billion total for similar transactions in 2020.</p><p>If the financial-technology specialist reaches its new target, its latest fund would be more than four times the size of its debut Motive Capital Fund I, which wrapped up with more than $473 million in 2019. Last August, Motive said in a regulatory filing it had more than $1.78 billion of assets under management.</p><p>Motive was founded in 2016 by Managing Partner Rob Heyvaert, who started his first company, Cimad Consultants, at age 24 and built its capital-markets settlement engine before selling the business to International Business Machines Corp. He later started another financial services business that was also sold and has led the formation of two blank-check companies.</p><p>Motive takes majority and minority stakes in North America- and Europe-based software, information and investment services companies that provide services to banking and payments, capital markets, data and analytics, investment management and insurance businesses.</p><p>Last July, Apollo acquired a nearly 25% stake in Motive and said it planned to become an investor in Motive funds, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The deal provided Capital Constellation, which backed Motive in 2018, with a partial exit, WSJ Pro Private Equity reported.</p><p>\"We are gratified with their rapid growth, which reflects their differentiated approach to a truly massive addressable market opportunity in fintech,\" Daniel Adamson, president of Capital Constellation, said of Motive.</p><p>Mr. Adamson declined to comment on Motive's fundraising efforts.</p><p>Motive backs financial companies with the goal of improving their productivity through applied technology. It also provides growth capital to rapidly expanding companies in the software and information-services sectors.</p><p>On Monday, Motive announced an agreement to acquire the BETA+ assets of the London Stock Exchange Group, joined by Clearlake Capital Group in the $1.1 billion deal. The operations, which together generated revenue of about $300 million last year, include securities processing, custody, clearing and asset servicing technology, cost and tax basis reporting software and front-end client services.</p><p>Also this week, one of the blank-check companies led by Mr. Heyvaert closed its combination with San Francisco-based Forge Global Inc., a private securities marketplace, to form Forge Global Holdings Inc. The company's shares, which began trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, surged nearly 60% to close at $16.15 each that day.</p><p>On March 15, Motive said it would sell its investment in Clonakilty, Ireland-based software company Global Shares, a provider of cloud-based share plan management systems for employers, to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. for its asset and wealth management unit. Motive first backed the business in July 2018, acquiring a roughly 40% stake for about $25 million. Terms of the sale weren't disclosed.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
