  "text": "<p>Good morning. It's jobs Friday, which is lucky, because we need an excuse to start talking about inflation again. Write to us: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:ethan.wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a>&#xa0;</p> <h2>IBM as myth and warning</h2> <p>IBM's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded67317-682d-4cd9-8e41-fc72646dee12\">spin-off</a> of its data centre services business became official yesterday, when Kyndryl began trading. The new company fell more than 7 per cent in its debut, a fitting end to one of the stock market's favourite morality tales. It's a story about how greed, taken too far, is self-defeating. </p> <p>It starts in the 1990s, when IBM was close to bankruptcy, its core mainframe business having been ambushed by the personal computer. But a shift into technology services and consulting brings the company roaring back. But IBM's commitment to technological excellence was soon replaced by a love affair with earnings growth. In 2010 the company said it would double earnings per share, to hit $20, in five years. </p> <p>Earnings rose at first, drawing Warren Buffett into a huge investment in 2011. But the company was milking its cash cows, cutting expenses, underinvesting and missing the future. It was tragically late to the big shift to cloud computing in the last decade. The stock peaked in 2013, and IBM earned $6 a share last year. Here's the chart:</p> <p>I like this story; it appeals to my prejudices. But I wonder if it is true and — more importantly — whether the humbling of IBM could have been foreseen in advance. So I had a look at the historical numbers. Here are three decades of annual revenue, gross profit and earnings per share. The red line marks the moment the stock peaked:</p> <p>The interesting thing is that revenue started moving more or less sideways in 2008, years before the stock noticed that anything had gone wrong. It's pretty likely that investors were distracted by the roaring increases in earnings per share. But the continued rise in gross profit was important too. I know this because I worked for a value investor at the time, we owned the stock, and all we cared about was the fact that gross profit dollars went up, quarter after quarter. </p> <p>Gross profit is, in fact, very important. As I have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da13ee34-d040-4adf-9d99-2815283c9b4c\">written before</a>, gross profit is what happens when you can sell your product for more than it costs you to make. It means you are adding value and have pricing power. All other measures of profit are derivative of it. </p> <p>But those increasing gross profits (and per-share earnings) need to be put in the context of this chart, of spending on research and development and fixed investment:</p> <p>IBM has always spent a lot of money on R&amp;D, but that spending flatlined starting in 2004, even as earnings per share growth was accelerating. And as for capital expenditure — well, look at the chart. </p> <p>Now, it may be that as IBM moved into services, it needed less capital investment. But that R&amp;D drift is a warning sign. Compare its research spending and capex to Microsoft's:</p> <p>Where was IBM spending money? On shareholders:</p> <p>The numbers — at least at this high level of abstraction — line up with the myth. Investment fell as EPS and payouts rose, and this proved unsustainable. Rising gross profits fooled people like me, because they were driven not by the creation of new value but (to hear old IBM-ers tell it) by squeezing customers who were bound to the company by high switching costs. </p> <p>This morality tale matters because IBM is one of the greatest companies that has ever existed. According to <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447\">calculations</a> made by Hendrik Bessembinder, as of 2018, it had created more shareholder wealth in its history than all but four other companies. </p> <p>We live in an era dominated by a handful of companies that appear to have permanent competitive advantages. It is worth remembering how great companies can fall low.</p> <h2>A value-growth reversal?</h2> <p>The yield curve, having flattened hard during the great central bank tightening head fake of October 2021, is showing very early signs of steepening again. Not surprising, after the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have made dovish noises in the past two days. The whole curve fell on Thursday, but the five-year note fell more that the 10 or 30 year.</p> <p>The question is, will value stocks follow? They have tracked the 10-2 curve neatly for the past year, as “reflation trade” has become standard Wall Street jargon: </p> <p>The logic is simple here. A steep curve implies growth (most of the time) and in a high-growth world, economically sensitive value stocks see profits pop. Growth stocks suddenly don't look so special. Zooming in on the past month:</p> <p>So far, growth has kept on outperforming, even as the curve has steepened a touch (or at least stopped flattening). Do investors think that, despite their dovish promises, central bankers will be forced to tighten policy soon? </p> <p>Perhaps. Or maybe rotations just take time. We are already seeing early signs of a pivot towards small caps, which tend to be more cyclical. In the past five days the S&amp;P 600 small-cap index has jumped 4 per cent while the S&amp;P 500 put on half as much. Unhedged is watching closely. </p> <h2>Money for meme stocks</h2> <p>Avis Car Rental catapulted over 108 per cent at one point on Tuesday, for some reason. No one much cared; meme stock insanity is no longer news.</p> <p>For a while, there was a popular notion that the money the Treasury was dumping into the economy was ending up in meme stocks. If that's right, the fun might not last. The personal savings rate sank to 7.5 per cent in September — basically back to where it was before the pandemic began. Americans are back doing what we do best: spending.</p> <p>Here is the savings rate plotted against the moves in two big retail stocks:</p> <p>Will the big retail stocks follow the savings rate back down? Well, remember the difference between stocks and flows. The savings rate is a flow, and is falling. But household balance sheets, a stock, remain at all-time highs. In the second quarter of this year, American households' net worth was almost eight times household income — a record. </p> <p>Which raises interesting questions. Is retail market activity influenced income, or of wealth (or neither)? Do Americans speculate with their pay cheques, or their piggy banks? </p> <h2>One good read</h2> <p>A few weeks ago I read <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/20/magazine/sharks-cape-cod.html\">this</a>, about sharks, in The New York Times Magazine a few weeks ago. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Click at your own risk.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong and Ethan Wu 2021 'The parable of IBM' FT.com 5 November.
