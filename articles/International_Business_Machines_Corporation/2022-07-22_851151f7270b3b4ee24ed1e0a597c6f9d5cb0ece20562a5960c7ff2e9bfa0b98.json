  "title": "Stock Futures Retreat After Three-Day Rally; All three major U.S. stock indexes are on pace to end the week with gains",
  "text": "<p>In premarket trading, a sharp plunge in Snap shares weighed on growth stocks. Snap lost 29% before the opening bell after posting its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth as a public company. Meanwhile, Twitter shares fell 2.5% after the company posted a second-quarter loss and noted that revenue was hurt by uncertainty related to Elon Musk's pending acquisition.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are on pace to end the week in solidly positive territory, offering a respite to investors who have seen their portfolios pummeled this year. A stretch of earnings reports this week have given investors confidence to wade in and scoop up beaten-down stocks. Netflix and IBM are among those who have beaten Wall Street expectations.</p><p>This week marked the return of a trade that has dominated in recent years: Buying tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite has risen 5.3% this week, based on Thursday's closing prices, outpacing the S&amp;P 500's 3.5% rise. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla have emerged as among the biggest gainers this week, with shares of all three companies rising 13% or more through Thursday.</p><p>Nonetheless, few investors are willing to call a bottom to a selloff that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 16% this year. Persistently high inflation, the possibility of a recession and the war in Ukraine remain at the forefront of investors' minds.</p><p>\"I think investors are fishing for the bottom,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research. But, he said, \"I still would be cautious.\"</p><p>Mr. Brzeski noted that next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve, as well as coming U.S. gross domestic product data, could inject more volatility in the markets.</p><p>Investors will also maintain a close eye on Europe, which has been beset by concerns about the cost of living and an energy crisis that could push economies into recession. On Friday, fresh business surveys suggested that the eurozone economycontracted in July. Excluding pandemic lockdown months, this would mark the first contraction signaled by purchasing managers' indexes since 2013.</p><p>Still, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.5%, boosted by shares of tech stocks and energy companies. Shares of Uniper fell 16% after reports that Germany would take a 30% stake in the company and provide a bailout deal after it was hit hard by dwindling supplies of Russian gas.</p><p>The euro retreated 0.7% against the dollar to $1.0162, raising the possibility that Europe's common currencycould reach parity again.</p><p>Traders also remained focused on the flow of Russian natural gas through the critical Nord Stream pipeline, as well as the ripple effects from the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB stock index swung between gains and losses and recently traded up 0.1%. Brent crude fell 0.7% to $98.82 a barrel Friday.</p><p>Some investors say they have jumped back into the market in recent weeks to take advantage of bargains, noting that extreme bearish sentiment is often a contrarian signal. BofA Global Research on Friday reported \"max bearish\" sentiment among investors in its closely watched Bull &amp; Bear Indicator.</p><p>\"There's lots of metrics that point to negativity on equities. That's a good starting point for us and what has given us more confidence\" to add to equity positions, said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal &amp; General Investment Management.</p><p>On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.816%, down from 2.908% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>In Asia, trading was fairly flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Retreat After Three-Day Rally</p>",
