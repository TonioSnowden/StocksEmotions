  "title": "Venture Capitalists Seek to Buy Phoenix Suns With Potential Financing From Peter Thiel and Others; The group's $3 billion bid comes as the team has been up for sale following turmoil with its owner",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, the pair, along with others participating in their bid, met with the Suns' top brass, including the team's chief executive and its president of basketball operations and general manager, and toured the National Basketball Association team's arena and practice facility, the people said. Second-round bids are due in January, the people said.</p><p>The Suns didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Team owner Robert Sarver said in September that he would begin the search for buyers for the Suns and the Mercury after an investigation into his workplace conduct prompted the NBA to suspend him for a year and fine him $10 million.</p><p>While Messrs. Selby and Pressman are the only ones named on the offer sheet, the pair are assembling a group of up to roughly 10 others to help finance the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Other potential financiers in the deal include Mr. Thiel and private-equity and sovereign-wealth funds, such as the Qatar Investment Authority, the people said. The NBA recently said it would accept investment from pension and sovereign-wealth funds.</p><p>Should the group win the deal, Mr. Thiel would become a significant shareholder in the team even though he isn't listed on the group's initial offer, the people said.</p><p>Mr. Thiel didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Thiel, who co-founded online payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc., has emerged as a major Republican donor, including in Arizona. Mr. Thiel was one of Facebook's earliest investors and its longest-serving outside board member before parent company Meta Platforms Inc. said earlier this year that he would step down from its board.</p><p>Mr. Selby has been a longtime Arizona resident and recently launched a $110 million venture fund to target early-stage startups based there. Mr. Pressman is on the boards of technology companies including Nextdoor Holdings Inc. and has led Shasta's investments in startups that have gone on to be acquired by companies including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and International Business Machines Corp.</p><p>The Suns reached the NBA Finals in 2021. The Mercury have won three Women's National Basketball Association championships, most recently in 2014, and have been Brittney Griner's team since she entered the league in 2013.</p><p>Mr. Sarver's suspension followed an independent investigation that found, among other things, he had used a racial slur on at least five occasions \"when recounting the statements of others,\" had made numerous sex-related comments and treated female employees unequally, and had engaged in \"inappropriate physical conduct toward male employees.\" The sale comes after numerous parties called Mr. Sarver's punishment from the league—which included the largest fine the NBA's constitution and bylaws allow—insufficient. Those critics included minority owner Jahm Najafi, Suns sponsor PayPal, point guard Chris Paul and the National Basketball Players Association.</p><p>Robert O'Connell contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Marc Vartabedian at marc.vartabedian@wsj.com</p>",
