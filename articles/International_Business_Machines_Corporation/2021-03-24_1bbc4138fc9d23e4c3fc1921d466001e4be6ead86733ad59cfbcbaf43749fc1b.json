  "title": "Intel Sets  Strategy  To Speed  Its Chip  Revival  ---  Semiconductor maker  earmarks $20 billion  to expand U.S. plants,  will boost outsourcing  ----  By Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Intel Corp.'s new chief executive is fast tracking efforts to revive the semiconductor giant with a broad plan that mixes increased outsourcing with a commitment to spend $20 billion on new factories that could help address a global chip shortage. </p><p>   Pat Gelsinger said Tuesday that Intel would rely more heavily on third-party chip-making partners, including for some of its most cutting-edge processors, starting in 2023. </p><p>   But the new CEO, on the job a little more than a month, said Intel wasn't abandoning its historic roots of being both a designer and manufacturer of chips and would retain most production in-house. The company, he said, also is renewing efforts to make chips for others and targeting customers such as Apple Inc. and chip rival Qualcomm Inc. </p><p>   To underpin those manufacturing ambitions, Intel plans to build two new chip factories, commonly referred to as fabs --  short for fabrication -- at existing facilities in Arizona, Mr. Gelsinger said, with production from the $20 billion, multiyear investment due to start there in 2024. Intel also said that within the year it would detail further expansion plans. </p><p>   \"We are back with a vengeance,\" Mr. Gelsinger said in an interview. </p><p>   Wall Street cheered the plan. The stock rose more than 6% in after-hours trading. </p><p>   \"This puts them in the best position to get out products that are competitive as quickly as possible,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said, while cautioning \"it's going to be a long-term process to get Intel back to where it once was.\" </p><p>   Concerns about the robustness of the U.S. chip industry have grown in Washington over the past couple of years as production shifted to Asia. Those worries intensified in recent months amid a global component shortage. Car makers, in particular, have felt the impact, causing them to idle some of their production capacity. </p><p>   President Biden pledged last month to fix the chip shortages and ordered a review to identify ways to strengthen supply chains in critical fields such as semiconductors. Chip makers broadly welcomed the move, though warned there was no quick fix to current supply bottlenecks. The U.S. industry has argued for years that the federal government hasn't sufficiently supported what it says are critical chip-building capacities, including financial inducements to build plants. </p><p>   The U.S. now accounts for about 12% of global semiconductor-manufacturing capacity, down from 37% in 1990 as other countries have subsidized growth of their chip makers, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group. </p><p>   \"Every industry needs more semi capabilities,\" said Mr. Gelsinger, who rejoined Intel after serving as the company's chief technology officer during a prior stint. </p><p>   Intel, he said, is bidding on a Pentagon contract to build a commercial fab to meet U.S. government security needs. </p><p>   Under its enhanced outsourcing plan, Intel would ask others -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- to make crucial components of its chips. The move takes advantage of a design approach Intel and others have embraced: making semiconductors in a Lego-brick-like manner. Mr. Gelsinger said the company would, in some cases, outsource the core components of its central processors, the brain of a computer. </p><p>   Intel has pushed to build chips for others before, but failed to draw significant business. Mr. Gelsinger said Intel was more focused this time and had already attracted \"extraordinary interest\" from companies and governments in what it was offering. </p><p>   There are doubters the company will succeed this time making chips for others. \"They don't have a good history of working with customers like that,\" Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said. </p><p>   Intel, the largest U.S. chip maker by sales, had fallen out of favor with investors after a series of missteps. Graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp. overtook Intel last year as the largest U.S. chip company by market valuation. Nvidia's stock more than doubled last year amid pandemic-fueled sales of laptops and videogames. Intel's shares retreated 17%, though the stock has rallied about 20% since Intel said in January that Mr. Gelsinger would become CEO. </p><p>   Intel's woes date back several years. The company fell behind Asian rivals after repeated manufacturing missteps. Apple also dropped Intel as a chip supplier for some Mac computers, and the chip maker has suffered market-share losses and faced a push by activist investor Third Point LLC for strategic changes. The company said in January that it was parting ways with CEO Bob Swan and hiring Mr. Gelsinger as his successor. </p><p>   Intel's latest stumbles were tied to its so-called 7-nanometer semiconductors, a term that loosely describes performance and refers to how densely transistors are packed on a chip. Mr. Gelsinger said development of that chip was progressing well after the company modified its production process. The company aims to enter the final design stage for the chip this year, with chips available to customers in 2023. </p><p>   Intel also said it had struck a collaboration with International Business Machines Corp. around elements of chip design in a bid to speed manufacturing innovation. </p><p>   Mr. Gelsinger also said the company would top its first-quarter guidance issued earlier this year for sales and earnings. Sales are likely to reach $76.6 billion this year. That is down from a record $77.9 billion in 2020, but Wall Street had been expecting sales of about $72.7 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. </p><p></p>",
