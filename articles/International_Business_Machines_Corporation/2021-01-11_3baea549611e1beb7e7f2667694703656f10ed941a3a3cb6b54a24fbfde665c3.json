A startup position may be uncertain, but so are many others.</p><p>Startups offer the appeal of opportunities to take on multiple responsibilities early on in your career, the chance to have a big impact on a small team and strong workplace cultures, experts say. Tim Michaelis, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Northern Illinois University, still recommends all of his undergraduate students try their best to get hired at a startup, even during the pandemic. \"I would often get pushback that it isn't as secure as a big company like Google or IBM,\" he says. \"But I don't think there's a person in the country who truly feels secure in their jobs right now. So there's never been a better time to take a risk on a startup.\"</p><p>2. The risk of layoffs may be off-putting for some.</p><p>The downsides of working for startups include more risk, less structure, fewer mentors and a less-clear career path. \"With Covid, that risk has increased a lot,\" says Lisa Cohen, an associate professor at McGill University's business school who studies startups. Nearly 70,000 tech-startup employees world-wide lost jobs between March and the early summer, including more than 25,500 in the San Francisco region, according to a July report by U.K.-based brokerage BuyShares.co.uk. Meanwhile, a quarter of 1,036 U.S. employers surveyed closed open positions or rescinded offers made to graduating students in response to the pandemic, according to a report on recruiting trends by Michigan State University published in October. Chaa Loftin, a 27-year-old software engineer, eschewed startups in favor of established companies while job hunting. Impressed by its employee tenure record, he eventually accepted a job at IBM. \"At IBM, it tends to be around the five-to-seven year mark, and when I spoke with upper-level management, they discussed possible career paths for me and really emphasized growth within the company, which for me, as a millennial, is really important.\"</p><p>3. Established firms may offer stability beyond job security.</p><p>Some job seekers may feel more comfortable opting for a company with established policies, for example relating to taking additional time off during the pandemic, rather than the work culture common in startups.</p><p>\"Startups typically have ridiculous hours, so if you don't set expectations early on, it can be hard to change that in a remote-work environment,\" says Marjorie Kalomeris, a New York City career coach. Ana Maria Villegas, a 21-year-old recent graduate from Georgia State University said she reoriented her job search from startups to established companies for this reason. \"Big firms have more leverage to respond to the unique stresses of the pandemic,\" she said.</p><p>4. In-demand candidates still have some sway.</p><p>There are steps candidates can take during the hiring process to ensure that it is worth the leap of faith in an uncertain time. Kalomeris suggests candidates ask startups about their funding and look over their financials independently, evaluating growth potential and gauging the credentials and leadership style of the founders, who tend to have outsize impact in such companies. She also recommends setting boundaries about working hours. While the job market largely favors employers right now, due to rising unemployment—making salaries hard to nudge—there is room to negotiate lifestyle considerations and perks for remote work, like stipends to set up home offices, she added. Meanwhile, Nicholas Donahue, co-founder of startup Atmos, says he has offered higher equity and signing bonuses to get potential hires to the finish line.</p><p>Read the original article by Krithika Varagur here.</p><p>Joining a Startup May Not Be as Appealing as It Once Was</p>",
