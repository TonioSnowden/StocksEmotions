All three indexes ended the day at records.</p><p>Stocks have powered higher in recent sessions, putting the volatility sparked by swings in GameStop and other individual stocks in the rearview mirror.

They say that could boost growth when large companies are reporting robust profits but the broader economic outlook is patchy.</p><p>Democrats took a series of votes last week unlocking a process called reconciliation, which will allow the party to approve President Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan without Republican support in the Senate. House lawmakers are aiming to finalize and vote on a relief bill before the end of this month.</p><p>The combination of strong quarterly earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. companies and the possibility of more relief for the economy has given markets a shot in the arm, according to Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p><p>\"It's like your birthday and Christmas on the same day, and the markets are all happy,\" said Mr. Morris.</p><p>Another round of stimulus spending in the U.S., a net importer, also would be a boon for overseas stock markets, according to Mr. Morris. \"If you've got your . . . motors of growth in the U.S. and China doing very well this year, that helps everyone,\" he said.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. could return to full employment next year if lawmakers pass Mr. Biden's stimulus package.</p><p>Markets also have been buoyed by an upbeat set of earnings for the holiday quarter from large U.S. companies.

Ten of the index's 11 sectors ended Monday in positive territory, with only utilities, a traditionally defensive play, declining.</p><p>The market is in the midst of a broad \"reflation trade\" that is fueling gains in sectors that were beaten down by last year's coronavirus slowdown as well as small-cap stocks and emerging markets, said Paul Christopher , head of global market strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p><p>He chalked up investors' bullish mood to stimulus hopes, substantial savings that have piled up among U.S. consumers during the pandemic and hopes that Covid-19 vaccinations will let that money come pouring back into the economy later this year. \"There's a lot of dry powder on the sidelines waiting to be spent,\" Mr. Christopher said.</p><p>Bitcoin jumped 15% to $44,597, according to CoinDesk, after Tesla said it had invested $1.5 billion in the digital currency.
