Last week's labour market data surprised economists to the upside as non-farm payrolls rose by 263,000 compared with an expected 200,000. October's job gains were also revised up.</p> <p>Data this week on the services sector showed that part of the economy expanded for the 30th month in a row and inflation remains well above the Fed's 2 per cent target.</p> <p>The US central bank has raised its main policy rate from near zero to a range of 3.75 to 4 per cent so far this year and many observers are now asking if the pace of those borrowing cost rises will slow.</p> <p>Wall Street is betting that the US central bank will retreat from the 0.75 percentage point increases of the past four meetings when it gathers next week. The US futures market expects the benchmark rate to reach a peak range of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent by the middle of 2023.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Peru ousts president after ‘attempted coup'</strong> Lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9f1336a-9d79-4cb6-9e85-f9ef7e2eb439\">removed Pedro Castillo</a> yesterday after he tried to shut down congress before an impeachment vote. Vice-president Dina Boluarte, who was sworn in as the country's first female leader, called Castillo's move an “attempted coup d'état” during a hastily arranged ceremony.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Boluarte's arrival after a day of chaos in Lima<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f36be662-7c44-47ca-9d7d-ff779637cc0c\"> does not fix Peru's badly broken political system</a>, writes the FT's Latin America Editor Michael Stott.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Pentagon splits $9bn cloud computing contract among tech giants</strong> The Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55e5675c-6803-48c0-85d9-2097af69c16e\">has split a $9bn contract</a> for cloud computing services among Google, Oracle, Amazon and Microsoft, one year after scrapping a previous contract that was marred by accusations of political interference by the administration of former US president Donald Trump and bogged down by legal challenges.
