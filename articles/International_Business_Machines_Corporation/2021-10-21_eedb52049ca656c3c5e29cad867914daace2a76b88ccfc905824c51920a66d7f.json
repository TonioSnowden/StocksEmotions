  "text": "<p>* AT&amp;T gained 1.2%. The carrier added 928,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the third quarter, showing how a year of deep handset discounts for new and existing customers is proving a winning formula.</p><p>* Pinterest edged down 0.9% premarket, eating into Wednesday's 13% rise that came after The Wall Street Journal reported that PayPal is in talks to acquire the social-media platform.</p><p>* Blackstone jumped 2.9% premarket after the private-equity firm's net income nearly doubled in the third quarter, driven by strong investment performance for its largest strategies and continued expansion into fast-growing new business lines.</p><p>* American Airlines gained 1%. The airline turned a profit for the third quarter despite the rise of the Covid-19 Delta variant delaying some of its revenue recovery.</p><p>* IBM fell 5.5% premarket after it reported weaker-than-expected revenue in the latest quarter, weighed down by its cloud business and some clients' pause in spending.</p><p>* Rail operators were taking different trajectories after their earnings reports. Union Pacific ticked down 0.8% premarket after it logged higher earnings and revenue in the latest quarter, despite no growth in freight volumes.</p><p>* CSX gained 3.3% premarket after the rail operator posted third-quarter results ahead of expectations, as a 24% surge in revenue just outpaced a 23% increase in expenses.</p><p>* Canadian National Railway nudged up 0.9% premarket. Activist investor Elliott Management has a big stake in the company, adding to pressure on the railroad after its CEO resigned following a failed bid for rival Kansas City Southern.</p><p>* Las Vegas Sands slipped 2.7% premarket. The casino operator's losses narrowed in the third quarter as revenue improved, but increased pandemic-related restrictions and slow tourism continued to hurt financial results.</p><p>* Discover Financial Services was down 2.1% premarket after the company reported a better-than-expected profit in the latest quarter, but a loss on investment caused the company to miss revenue expectations.</p><p>* Intel, Chipotle, Snap, Mattel and Whirlpool will report earnings after the close.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Chinese dollar-bond defaults are rising quickly as the country's housing market slumps, and the problem could worsen as a wave of debt from the beleaguered industry comes due in the coming months.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Tesla, Pinterest, IBM, Intel: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
