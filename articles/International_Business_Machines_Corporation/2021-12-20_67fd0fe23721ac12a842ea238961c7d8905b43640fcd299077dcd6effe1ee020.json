  "text": "<p>Another chief executive rolled off the Unilever production line last week, when Leena Nair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39d03af0-219d-49b9-8e4d-864415098090\">was appointed</a> to run luxury goods company Chanel.</p> <p>Nair, who has worked at Unilever for nearly 30 years, is a product of the group's leadership development programme. Indeed, as the consumer goods company's chief human resources officer, she runs the system that builds its future leaders, and the leaders of other companies, including, in recent years, Unilever alumni such as Sir <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be55674a-6273-11ea-abcc-910c5b38d9ed\">Dave Lewis</a>, who ran Tesco, the UK retailer, until 2020. </p> <p>The likes of Unilever, McKinsey, IBM, and Procter &amp; Gamble are “CEO factories”. They can apply a first crude filter to the fire-hose of talented young graduates. This elite group then reaps the benefits of tailored training, job rotations and secondments. Managers emerge with a reputational boost based on the employer's corporate pedigree. </p> <p>Waiting at the CEO factory gate to see who emerges is no longer a foolproof succession shortcut, however. </p> <p>Factories have to be regularly retooled, for one thing. General Electric was the best-known and certainly the best-publicised CEO conveyor belt of the 1990s and early 2000s. Its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1f77dd6-f34f-11e0-b11b-00144feab49a\">Crotonville training centre</a> and leadership development programme won global renown. But the factory misfired in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99bf4992-c57a-11e8-8670-c5353379f7c2\">finding a replacement</a> for Jeff Immelt as GE chief executive, and the group turned in the end to an outsider, Larry Culp, former chief executive of Danaher, who is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb73e702-e885-4c20-8857-ddd29dc623af\">splitting GE up</a>. When shareholders asked about Crotonville at this year's annual meeting, Culp responded that the group was pursuing “a more diversified approach to management and leadership where the vast majority of development will come from what our leaders can learn on the job”.</p> <p>Corporate reputations are less stable than they once were. A <a href=\"https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=finance\">2015 paper</a> by Ye Cai of Santa Clara University and others reckoned a fifth of chief executives appointed by the largest 1,500 US listed companies between 1992 and 2010 came from 36 CEO factories, led by GE. Since then, though, I estimate 10 have undergone takeover, substantial restructuring, or demerger. Two more — Eastman Kodak and Sears — have filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>Like GE, Procter &amp; Gamble, another reliable blue-chip leader-mill, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1aad8d4-c3f8-11e2-aa5b-00144feab7de\">fluffed its succession plan</a> in 2009 and had to recall AG Lafley as chief executive. With Big Tech under regulatory attack, managers who might once have boasted of their work for Alphabet, Amazon or Facebook now have to answer awkward questions about how their employers have shaped their attitudes to data privacy, political influence and workplace culture.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of diversity champions such as Unilever's Nair, a big-company conveyor belt still risks churning out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8fe78a8-65e6-11e4-898f-00144feabdc0\">“default managers”</a>, who look the same and apply the same types of solutions as their predecessors to today's unpredictable challenges.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new leaders have been forged during the pandemic, shaped and tempered by real operational crises rather than classroom presentations.</p> <p>For all these reasons, employers must wonder if they need a costly CEO factory at all when they can mine the raw materials for leadership directly. </p> <p>Elena Lytkina Botelho of ghSmart, an advisory firm, challenges the idea that battle-hardened coronavirus veterans necessarily have what it takes. People “who are tested in wartime don't always work as leaders in peacetime”, she says. She believes CEO factories have “never been more important”, though reputation alone is no longer a guide to the quality of leaders a company might produce. More important is the type of experience would-be leaders receive. </p> <p>GhSmart <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/01/unexpected-companies-produce-some-of-the-best-ceos\">found</a> many successful chief executives came from lesser-known executive farms, including Larry Culp's former employer Danaher. These “stealth CEO factories” were able to provide a breadth of hands-on experience, autonomy and responsibility, combined with appropriate support. Critically, Botelho says the chief executive must “care about talent development”. Give it a few years, then, and Nair might just succeed in turning Chanel into a CEO factory in its own right.</p> <p>But if the current crisis teaches anything, it is the need to stay flexible. Discussing how to develop 21st-century leaders at the recent Global Peter Drucker Forum, consultant Deepa Prahalad, whose late father CK Prahalad helped to develop the idea that companies should identify their <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2008/09/15/core-competence\">“core competences”</a>, used the analogy of a parent checking their child's shoes for room to grow. </p> <p>“We don't have solutions for a lot of the challenges that are before us and we don't know exactly what competences will provide the answers,” she added. The best way to prepare future leaders, then, may be to give them “skin in the game” and see how they perform.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:andrew.hill@ft.com\">andrew.hill@ft.com</a></p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewtghill\">@andrewtghill</a></p><p>Source: Andrew Hill 2021 'Why the world's ‘CEO factories' need retooling' FT.com 20 December.
