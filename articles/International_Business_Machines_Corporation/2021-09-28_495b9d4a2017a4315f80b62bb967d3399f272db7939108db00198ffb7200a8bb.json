  "text": "<p>   Mr. Zachariah's job as a business technology strategist at International Business Machines Corp. can be done completely remotely, and Ms. Zachariah commutes to the district about three days a week for an executive job she recently started at Adfero, a communications firm in the district. </p><p>   They said their housing costs dropped from about $3,500 a month to $3,000 a month in Frederick, and they'll save $12,000 a year in daycare for their 1-year-old. </p><p>   \"The exodus calculation, for me, included the social unrest in D.C., the cost of living, becoming a mom,\" said Ms. Zachariah. \"But we could never make a move like this without flexibility at work.\" </p><p>   Jim Bass, a Frederick real-estate agent for 28 years, said prices of area homes at or above the $500,000 mark stayed stubbornly flat between 2010 and last year. But they rose 15% to 20% in 2020 and are still ticking upward, he said. \"Frederick is still just far enough from Washington and Baltimore that it never really came back after the recession\" that ended in 2009, Mr. Bass said. \"With commutes either nonexistent or much less often, we are seeing overdue appreciation.\" </p><p>   Mr. Freeman says his move to Florida is experimental. If it doesn't work out, he figures he can rent out both halves of his $479,000 Flagler Beach duplex and relocate. </p><p>   One unknown is that his employer, the Center for International Policy, left its office space during the pandemic and decided to become \"a think tank without walls\" for the foreseeable future, Mr. Freeman said. </p><p>   Mr. Freeman's friend, real-estate agent Cassidy Burns, had helped him look at properties in the district for years. He understands the impulse to leave. Mr. Burns said he fell in love with Charleston, S.C., a few years ago and has used the pandemic to prepare to run his Washington-area real estate and property management businesses from afar. He aims to leave the city in April. </p><p></p>",
