  "text": "<p>Bruce W. Arden endured part of his childhood on a farm in Kansas with no indoor plumbing or electricity. At age 17, in 1944, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and learned the elements of electronics as a radar technician.</p><p>\"Luck ushered me into digital computing,\" he wrote in a memoir offered to friends and family. After World War II, at the Allison division of General Motors, he helped design parts for jet engines and graduated from slide rules to an IBM card-programmed calculator.</p><p>Later, at the University of Michigan, he used a mainframe computer to calculate trajectories for Boeing missiles. He also helped the university find more efficient ways for researchers to write programs and share processing and memory resources. In 1959, with two colleagues, he created the Michigan Algorithm Decoder, used to convert language that makes sense to people into instructions that a computer can read.</p><p>\"My efforts were mainly to make programming more available to nonspecialists,\" he wrote.</p><p>He chaired computer-science departments at the University of Michigan and Princeton University, and was a dean at the University of Rochester. Among his students at Princeton was Eric Schmidt, later chief executive of Google, who described the professor as \"one of the founders of computer science.\"</p><p>Dr. Arden died Dec. 8 in Livonia, Mich. He was 94.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
