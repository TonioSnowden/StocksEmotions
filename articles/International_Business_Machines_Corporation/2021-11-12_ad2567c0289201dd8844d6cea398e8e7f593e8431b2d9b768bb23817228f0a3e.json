  "title": "Letter: The criminality of essay mills is hurting universities",
  "text": "<p>Essay mills are a pernicious feature of higher education and your investigation (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffc1c843-40c2-4fdf-b6f5-c118b363ad90\">Report</a>, FT Weekend, November 6) illustrated the sad ubiquity of these services, and the resulting challenges for universities and for the student experience.</p> <p>Many across the higher education sector will therefore welcome the inclusion of a “cheating services” chapter in the UK's “skills and post-16 education bill”. This makes it an offence to advertise or provide a commercial essay service. While this is a much-needed step, once enacted it's likely just to signal the criminality of essay mills rather than solve the underlying problem.</p> <p>Returning universities to a system of assessment dominated by invigilated examinations would be a simple but retrograde step. </p> <p>We need educators at universities supported and resourced to create imaginative and stretching courses designed to enhance learning. </p> <p>Ensuring students are on degree programmes that interest them — rather than succumbing to societal pressure to study something with statistically better short-term financial returns — would also assist. </p> <p>Universities then need to be more aware of pressures on students, and ensure programmes and supports have the flexibility to enable all students to succeed on their own merits. </p> <p>Above all we need to foster a joy for learning, rather than drifting into academic policing. </p> <p>Of course the FT missed an opportunity to solve the problem for us all. If only you'd commissioned answers to the question “Essay mills undermine academic integrity and harm students. Discuss”. It may have caused those service providers to implode.</p> <p><strong>David Boughey</strong><br><em>Professor of International Business History, University of Exeter Business School, Exeter, Devon, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: The criminality of essay mills is hurting universities' FT.com 12 November.
