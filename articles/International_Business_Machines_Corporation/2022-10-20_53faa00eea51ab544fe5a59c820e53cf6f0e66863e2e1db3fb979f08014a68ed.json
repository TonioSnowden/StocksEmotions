  "text": "<p>\"Our order is final,\" he told the New York Times in January 1986. Six months later, though, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional.</p><p>Mr. Bowsher, a former partner at accounting firm Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., reverted to his customary role of running an agency providing reports on the financial health and effectiveness of government programs. He continued to fulminate against what he called \"budgetary chicanery to create the appearance of a lower deficit,\" and incurred the wrath of some politicians by insisting that tax increases might be necessary.</p><p>Looking back on his 15-year term as comptroller general and head of the GAO (now known as the Government Accountability Office), Mr. Bowsher was most proud of the alarms it raised in the 1980s about failing savings and loan institutions, including early warnings about the need for a bailout of depositors.</p><p>Mr. Bowsher died Sept. 30 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 91 years old.</p><p>When Congress created the GAO in 1921, it was staffed mainly by clerks who checked vouchers for government spending. It gradually took on a broader role in assessing what taxpayers were getting for their money. Mr. Bowsher pushed the agency to identify problems in government programs and propose remedies. \"He encouraged accountants to go beyond being bean counters,\" said Natwar Gandhi, a former colleague.</p><p>In 1991, the GAO released a report saying U.S. policy makers could learn from Canada's experience in controlling healthcare costs. Though the GAO acknowledged that Canadians faced long waits for some medical procedures and didn't call for replicating the Canadian system, the report enraged some conservatives who saw it as an endorsement of socialism.</p><p>Recent Obituaries</p><p>* Benjamin Civiletti, Post-Watergate Attorney General, Dies at 87</p><p>* Robbie Coltrane, Actor Who Played Hagrid in 'Harry Potter' Movies, Dies at 72</p><p>* Patricia M.

Weeks after the passage of the Gramm-Rudman law, a Wall Street Journal editorial declared: \"Gramm-Rudman has given us a new American president. His name is Charles A. Bowsher.\" The editorial concluded with a question: \"Who elected him?\"</p><p>Rep. Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, and others filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Gramm-Rudman. In response, the GAO hired Lloyd Cutler as an outside counsel. Mr. Cutler \"said I would be famous in all law schools as a result of this case,\" known as Bowsher v. Synar, Mr. Bowsher said later. \"What he didn't tell me was that I was going to lose.\"</p><p>His warnings about the risks of failing S&amp;Ls proved accurate. The federal bailout eventually cost an estimated $124 billion.</p><p>Charles Arthur Bowsher, known as Chuck, was born May 30, 1931, and grew up in Elkhart, Ind., and Chicago. His father was a railroad engineer. His mother, who was born in Canada, had run a candy store in Toronto before marrying. He had an identical twin brother, Jack, who grew up to head International Business Machines Corp.'s employee-education program.</p><p>Charles Bowsher studied accounting at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, served in the Army at Camp Kilmer and went on to the University of Chicago for an M.B.A. degree. In 1956, he joined Arthur Andersen.</p><p>He met Mary Mahoney, a social worker, and they married in 1963. \"He has always loved government and public service,\" she told the New York Times later. \"On our first date, he said he would like to be in government some day, and I remember thinking, 'He isn't your average little accountant.'\"</p><p>In 1967, not long after he rose to partner at Andersen, the Defense Department recruited him as assistant secretary of the Navy for financial management. After serving in that role from 1967 to 1971, he returned to Andersen to head the firm's government practice in Washington, D.C.</p><p>President Ronald Reagan appointed him as comptroller general and head of the GAO in 1981. \"I hope you never lose that sense of indignation every citizen feels over waste and fraud in government,\" Mr. Reagan said at the time. Mr. Bowsher didn't.</p><p>He sought to make the GAO a more attractive employer by adding a child-care center and updating the offices. Underlings were encouraged to call him Chuck.</p><p>He is survived by his wife of 59 years, two children and three grandchildren. His twin brother died in 2021.</p><p>After retiring from the GAO, he served on a variety of boards. In 2009, he resigned as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank system's Office of Finance after finding himself uncomfortable with the way the home loan banks valued their mortgage securities. \"I decided I didn't have confidence in the financial statements,\" he told the Journal. Banks had too much wiggle room in valuing those securities, he said.</p><p>In a video interview recorded by the GAO, Mr. Bowsher recalled that when he joined the agency in 1981 his annual salary plunged to about $65,000 from the $265,000 he was earning at Andersen. His brother and some colleagues questioned the wisdom of taking such a huge pay cut, he said, but it worked out well.</p><p>\"It was a marvelous career, and I really became quite wealthy,\" Mr. Bowsher said. \"I always figured that if you did a good job, there would be a future out there.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
