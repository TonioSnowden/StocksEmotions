  "text": "<p>Lazard has set up a unit of advisers to counsel chief executives and company directors on geopolitical risks, as the boutique investment bank bets it can boost fees by combining financial advice with guidance on an increasingly chaotic world.</p> <p>The firm's new geopolitical advisory team is being launched as multinational corporations grapple with volatile events around the world, from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a> to simmering tensions between the US and China.</p> <p>Lazard announced the team on Thursday alongside the appointment of Jami Miscik, a former deputy director of intelligence at the CIA and co-chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board in the administration of Barack Obama. Miscik, who until recently worked with Kissinger Associates, is joining Lazard as a senior adviser in the geopolitical advisory team.</p> <p>Peter Orszag, chief executive of Lazard's financial advisory business and a former budget director in the Obama White House, said the bank saw an opening to assess the financial consequences of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/geopolitics\">geopolitical events</a> that complemented its existing global practice.</p> <p>Orszag said Lazard would differentiate its offering from other risk consultancies by pairing advice on global affairs with its expertise in dealmaking and data analytics.</p> <p>“There are other groups out there assessing geopolitical risks but no one is combining that with financial analysis the way we can,” Orszag said in an interview.</p> <p>The move brings Lazard, which advises blue-chip companies such as Google, IBM and BT Group on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/mergers-acquisitions\">mergers and acquisitions</a>, into competition with “pure play” international affairs consultancies such as Kissinger Associates, Eurasia Group and Teneo's WestExec Advisors.</p> <p>Boutique investment banks such as Lazard have largely been dependent on lumpy but lucrative M&amp;A fees that can surpass tens of millions of dollars on a single transaction.</p> <p>However, they have increasingly tried to offer other types of advice to executives, including on capital raising and strategies for repelling activist investors. Although much less lucrative than advising on dealmaking, Lazard and its rivals hope that the steady dialogue with executives and directors will help them win larger mandates.</p> <p>“Today companies have moved from thinking analysis of the geopolitical environment is a nice-to-have, to bringing it to the forefront of their decision-making,” Miscik said.</p> <p>Miscik is joining Lazard alongside General John Abizaid, the former head of US Central Command, and William McRaven, the head of US special operations when Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>The geopolitical team will be based in a newly established Lazard office in Austin, Texas and will be co-led by Theodore Bunzel and David Kaufman.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Sujeet Indap in New York 2022 'Lazard sets up geopolitical risk unit to capitalise on global volatility' FT.com 13 October.
