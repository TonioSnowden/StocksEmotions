  "text": "<p>Thomas Yuen was working in 1980 as an electrical engineer in Southern California when his kidneys failed and he learned he would require dialysis treatments for the rest of his life. The news gave him two things: a sudden need to earn much more money, and a drive to seize what life he had left.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Mr. Yuen co-founded AST Research, a technology hardware maker that got its start making expansion cards for International Business Machines' first personal computer. The cards added memory, storage and several ports to early computers, and were an instant hit, former colleagues said. Mr. Yuen and his co-founders, Albert Wong and Safi Qureshey, grew the company from a tiny office routinely rattled by landing airplanes into a Fortune 500 manufacturer with revenue of $1.14 billion by 1992.</p><p>Mr. Yuen spent the final decades of his life funding and promoting stem-cell therapy research, in hopes of finding treatments for chronic diseases such as Alport syndrome, his disease. He spared no expense outfitting his own R&amp;D firm, PrimeGen Biotech, according to Steve Gershick, the firm's chief financial officer.</p><p>Mr. Yuen was up-to-date about the intricacies of his company's research almost until his death on Feb. 13, friends and family say.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
