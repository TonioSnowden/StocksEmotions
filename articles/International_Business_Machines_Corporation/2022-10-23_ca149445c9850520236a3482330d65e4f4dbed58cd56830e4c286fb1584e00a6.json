  "text": "<p>Robin Harding misunderstands the motivation of the US (“Slowing Chinese growth is a recipe for global instability”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e438ce2a-4b7e-433d-a3db-dcadfc85f57d\">Opinion</a>, October 14) when he argues that America's policy is aimed at slowing China's ascent to becoming the world's largest economy. This description of policy simply fuels greater stress dynamics in the relationship between the two countries, and reinforces China's paranoia. While it may be argued that China's geopolitical ambitions are at the core of America's overall concerns, this doesn't work so well as a motivation for its policies on semiconductors and other advanced technologies.</p> <p>Another and perhaps more accurate way to look at the competition between the world's economic superpowers is through the lens of industrial policy and technological dominance.</p> <p>Whereas the US and its western allies were generally asleep in the wake of the 2015 “Made in China” report that detailed the sectors in which China aimed to establish its industrial and technological dominance, this has now changed. As a result of supply chain shortages, the pandemic and a re-evaluation of the advantages of reshoring, some countries have woken up to the economic challenge. </p> <p>Semiconductor legislation and technology curbs seen in this light are a stronger explanation for recent US actions than a more sinister goal of halting China's rise. In an environment of rampant mistrust between the two countries, it would better to attribute policy causation properly.</p> <p><strong>Danny Leipziger</strong> <br><em>Professor of International Business<br>George Washington University Washington, DC, US</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Industrial policy is a lens on superpower rivalry' FT.com 23 October.
