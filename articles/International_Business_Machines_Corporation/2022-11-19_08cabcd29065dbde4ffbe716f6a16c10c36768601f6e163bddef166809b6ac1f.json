  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  The Off Duty 50: Holiday Gift Guide:  It's About  Timeless  ---  In a throwaway world, these  50 heirloom-quality presents are  designed to be keepers",
  "text": "<p>\n  We're always here to help you find gifts that elicit \"you really know me!\" enthusiasm, even from the normally taciturn. This year, we aimed higher, aspiring to choose items with such eternal appeal, and of such high quality, that they might become heirlooms -- used and loved by both your giftees and subsequent generations. To set a suitably ancestral mood, we've included photos of our own forebears or distant, younger selves, and asked some notable people who we admire what \"heirloom\" means to them. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1. Lapel Appeal (Splurge!) </p><p>\n  Can a blazer look both historic and fresh? This one, with emphatic shoulders and a wasp waist, recalls Christian Dior's Bar Jacket from the celebrated 1947 \"New Look\" collection and, in our opinion, achieves that tricky objective. New York brand Rentrayage has made it from red-and-blue plaid wool deadstock (in this case, leftover fabric sourced from Italian warehouses). If passed down, it might just represent the \"New New Look\" of 2047. Ramblette Blazer, $850, Rentrayage.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2. Actual Rose Colored Glasses </p><p>\n  Stacked into a tower or imprinted with a saucy red-lipstick pucker, these cherry-blossom-pink coupes from Kuwaiti homeware brand Ecru look like a hand-me-down from your great-grandmother, if your great-grandmother was Dorothy Parker. Made in India, the glasses flaunt a hand-etched star pattern that confers considerable sparkle on any cocktail contained therein. The vibe is most certainly vintage, in a particular bon-mot-slinging, jumping-in-a-fountain-in-your-tuxedo kind of way. Pink Star Coupes Set of Four, $120, EcruOnline.in </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  3. Posters for Posterity </p><p>\n  For anyone who's happily afflicted with wanderlust, a vintage travel poster is affordable art that can really transport. The pool of possibilities is deep. Take, for example, a cute illustration of a 1960s Danish fisherman for $225 (via Chisholm Larsson Gallery, pictured alongside other offerings from Chisholm Larsson) or a colorful 1930s Hawaii/South Seas Matson Line luggage label for $75 (from International Poster Gallery) or an original lithograph from Portugal's travel board that declares, with hilarious graphics, \"respect the tourist,\" for $69 (via The Vintage Poster). </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  4. Penguin Classic </p><p>\n  The humble cocktail shaker is an eternal essential for amateur bartenders, even just as a deep vessel for drinks that need to be stirred. The easiest-to-use ones include a strainer, so that you can pour your finished drink directly into a glass without scrounging around for a separate spring strainer. This shaker is so equipped -- and shaped like an adorable penguin, telegraphing frostiness like crazy. Penguin Cocktail Shaker, $38, Viski.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  5. A Tough Ax To Follow </p><p>\n  An ax has obvious utility. What else chops firewood? But you'd be hard pressed to find one that could serve as a bona fide showpiece. That is unless you're browsing the wares at Motor City Axe. The Detroit-based company sources a wide variety of vintage cutters, which it then restores and sometimes paints in vibrant colors. It also carves its own line of axes out of American hickory wood, like this one. Motor City \"The Up North\" Camp Axe, $107, MotorCityAxe.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  6. Pretty as a Picture </p><p>\n  Lockets are meant to be passed down through generations and, while unusually petite at half-an-inch tall, this 14-karat yellow-gold iteration strikes us as entirely qualified for that role. (Petite means discreet.) From Brooklyn brand Catbird, it can be strung onto a variety of the brand's chains -- and filled with a meaningful, if tiny, photo of your giftee's choice. Get it engraved with a single letter for a personal touch. Dollhouse Locket Necklace, $168, CatbirdNYC.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  7. A Clearly Modern Hanukkah </p><p>\n  The traditional menorah becomes a covetable work of contemporary art in this interpretation, designed by the self-proclaimed \"Modernist Judaica\" label Via Maris. Colorful glass creates a sculptural silhouette that is anything but ordinary, a look that a Hanukkah-celebrating aesthete will value for the foreseeable future. Glass Chanukiah, $235, Via-Maris.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  8. Spice and Everything Nice </p><p>\n  Saffron's aroma is fleeting, but this timeless tool, designed expressly to grind the world's costliest spice, will endure. The mortar and pestle remains the best technology for getting maximum flavor out of the red-gold stigmas of the saffron crocus. A collaboration between Seattle's Madisonware Ceramics andVilla Jerada, purveyor of Moroccan and Levantine pantry products, this one comes in a kit with a 1-gram tin of Moroccan saffron. Saffron Mortar &amp; Pestle Kit, $52, VillaJerada.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  9. Staying Power </p><p>\n  For a history buff, a membership to the National Trust for Historic Preservation is a slam dunk: It functions as a curated travel guide to more than 500 landmarks, and revenue goes to saving important places. Buy in at the $20 level for discounts at Historic Hotels of America, including the Greyfield Inn in Georgia, a Carnegie mansion. The $250 Preservation Council Steward level adds reduced rates at Historic Hotels Worldwide, such as the original Raffles (c. 1887) in Singapore, and includes two gift memberships, because isn't it better to give as well as receive? SupportSavingPlaces.org </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  10. Knit to Last </p><p>\n  Wait, a holiday sweater that isn't ugly? With a traditional Andean pattern, this cheery knit steers clear of dancing elves, singing spruces and blinking-nosed Rudolphs. Los Angeles brand Industry of All Nations worked with a co-op of farmers and knitters in Bolivia to create this exemplar of classic coziness, which is hand-knit from resilient alpaca wool that will see out many chilly winters. Alpaca Hand-Knit Sweater, $380, IndustryofAllNations.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  11. Warm Memories (Splurge!) </p><p>\n  Is your family's attic cluttered with baby clothes that haven't seen daylight since the Carter administration? Here's an idea: Liberate those dresses and dungarees from the cobwebby recesses, then enlist Brooklyn-based quilter Zak Foster to fashion them into a custom \"memory-quilt.\" The personalized process is rooted in conversation and, once the quilt has been started, takes about 4 to 6 weeks to finish -- resulting in a piece of functional art that will warm beds and hearts for generations. Custom Memory Quilt, from $1,500, ZakFoster.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  12. Never-ending Nosh </p><p>\n  Ah, the season of cut-glass dishes filled with festive snacks, ready to extend hospitality to any visitor, caroler or portly red-suited gentleman who might show up. Pass on this tradition with the gift of dried fruits and nuts from Ziba, a company committed to an ethical supply chain and the proliferation of delicious heirloom varieties. This variety pack includes two types of heirloom almonds and the coveted Afghan kishmish raisins, known as \"the gummy bear raisin.\" Variety Pack, $57 for 7 (5 ounce) bags, ZibaFoods.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  13. Excellent Points </p><p>\n  While plenty of apps can turn a phone into a compass, they're nothing one could bequeath to one's children. A better bet: the stainless-steel Voyager compass from the Scottish menswear brand Dalvey. Engrave the compass with your giftee's initials, or -- if you're feeling more verbose -- opt to get a message inscribed on the Voyager's shell. Voyager Compass in Blue Mother of Pearl, $139, from $14 for engraving, Dalvey.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  14. A Familiar Face </p><p>\n  Though our homes are lousy with digital timekeepers, it's nice to have a couple of hands and big old numbers to tell the hour less coldly. This redesign of IBM's Indicator Clock, a midcentury stalwart of factory and classroom walls that's over 13 inches across, includes a glass crystal and dusky-red steel housing. Tap into a Boomer's nostalgia or a Zoomer's penchant for all things analog by giving this bold, battery-powered ticker. 1960s IBM Standard Issue Clock in Paprika, $299, Schoolhouse.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  15. Dash Away! </p><p>\n  \"Dad, is it time to put the reindeer in the front yard?\" Holiday rituals with the potential to last generations can develop organically -- or they can be born of a big box containing a cloven-hoofed rattan figure adorned with 240 LEDs that will eventually become part of the family. At nearly 5-feet tall, this majestic stag can be lit in a choice of three different shades. Harlow Grey Rattan Leaping Stag Reindeer Light Up Outdoor Figure, $350, Lights4Fun.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  16. Top-Quality Topper (Splurge!) </p><p>\n  By issuing soothing sounds, ASMR audio clips are meant to trigger tingling sensations. Their sartorial equivalent might be the quietly seductive wares of San Francisco designer Evan Kinori. In a brown, rust and cream tweed, this hand-numbered jacket has the sort of boxy cut we like for layering over hoodies and knits. Forgoing logos, loud prints and style-stupidity, this impeccably crafted piece bears little resemblance to passing fads. Zip Jacket, $965, EvanKinori.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  17. Simmer Lovin' </p><p>\n  The artisans at Netherton Foundry in Shropshire, England, make hand-spun, black-iron cookware inspired by the region's 18th- and 19th-century iron masters. Launched in collaboration with cult British brand Toast, this stately stockpot takes soups, stews and curries as well as saucy oven roasts in its stride. Pre-seasoned with flax oil, the naturally nonstick surface thrives in high-temperature cooking. The beautiful, bulletproof construction will see this pot through many, many iterations of family recipes as they're passed down. Toast x Netherton Foundry Iron Stockpot, $145, US.Toa.st </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  18. A Weave Much to Be Desired </p><p>\n  Do you have giftees with depressingly white walls? Treat them to a colorful composition by London artist Dalia James, who crafts meticulous Bauhaus-inspired weavings using heritage techniques and biodegradable bamboo, wool and silk that's been hand-dyed, so no two pieces are the same. Toast x Dalia James Hand Woven Artwork, $375, US.Toa.st </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  19. Whoa, Nice Skirt </p><p></p>",
