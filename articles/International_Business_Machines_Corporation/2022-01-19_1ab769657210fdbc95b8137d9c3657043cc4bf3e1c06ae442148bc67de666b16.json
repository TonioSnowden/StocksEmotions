  "text": "<p>Mr. McDougall most recently served as deputy commissioner for the British data-protection regulator the Information Commissioner's Office, where he worked on artificial intelligence, advertising technology and competition, among other areas. Before that, Mr. McDougall worked in consulting capacities at Promontory Financial Group, a unit of International Business Machines Corp., and accounting and consulting firm Deloitte.</p><p>ZoomInfo said Mr. McDougall would focus on privacy and helping the company be transparent in how it collects and uses professional contact data. He also will advise on privacy best practices for the company, which provides a platform that helps sales and marketing teams improve their pitches to potential customers.</p><p>ZoomInfo's compliance function has until now resided with the company's general counsel, according to a company spokesman.</p><p>The company's geographical expansion and the addition of new products and services prompted ZoomInfo to set up a stand-alone compliance function, according to the spokesman.</p><p>The hire comes about a year and a half after the company went public and roughly four months after the business said it would simplify its shareholder structure from the one used when it went public to be more attractive for new investors and make it easier to potentially make more deals.</p><p>ZoomInfo in July raised about $500 million in debt and said it planned to use some of the funds to acquire Chorus.ai, a company that uses machine learning and AI to capture and analyze customer calls, meetings and emails. ZoomInfo agreed to spend about $575 million in the deal.</p><p>Write to David Smagalla at david.smagalla@wsj.com</p><p>ZoomInfo Adds Former U.K. Data-Protection Regulator as Compliance Chief</p>",
