  "title": "Stock Futures Slip, Signaling More Market Volatility; Tesla, Moderna, Nvidia shares fall premarket; Unilever gains after activist takes position in consumer-goods giant",
  "text": "<p>Ahead of the bell in New York, Tesla, due to file earnings Wednesday, lost 3.6%. Shares of Moderna and Pfizer also lost more than 3% premarket, while chip company Nvidia fell 2.9%.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes slipped, falling to 1.728% from 1.747% Friday. Yields have risen this year as bond prices have fallen, a selloff that has rippled through financial markets by punishing speculative bets on stocks and cryptocurrencies that took off when the Fed rushed to stimulate the economy in the early days of the pandemic.</p><p>The losses continued early Monday. Bitcoin traded at about $33,623, down 8.4% from its 5 p.m. ET level on Friday. Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF, a big winner in 2020, fell 1.9% in premarket trading.</p><p>The biggest single factor driving yields up and stock prices down is the expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates multiple times in 2022 to rein in inflation, which is running at its fastest pace in 40 years. The central bank is set to gather for a two-day meeting Tuesday. At its conclusion on Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to signal that rates will likely rise as soon as March.</p><p>The central bank is concerned fast-rising consumer prices will become self-reinforcing by feeding into expectations of higher inflation, said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank. \"It is talking about tightening aggressively to get on top of that.\"</p><p>Mr. Graham-Taylor said he thinks inflation will fall this year and that the Fed won't raise rates as many times as the market expects, pulling down 10-year government-bond yields.</p><p>Earnings season continues, with results due from Halliburton, International Business Machines and Steel Dynamics on Monday, followed by General Electric, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla later in the week. About a fifth of companies on the S&amp;P 500 have filed results, and 82% have beaten analysts' expectations for earnings per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Oil prices, which had defied recent pressure on broader markets by shooting higher since mid-December, edged down. Brent crude futures, the international energy benchmark, fell 0.3% to $87.70 a barrel.</p><p>International stock markets fell, following Wall Street lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 2.4%, led down by shares of travel, leisure, construction and technology companies.</p><p>Unilever, however, jumped 6.2% after reports that activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had bought a stake in the packaged-food and consumer-goods company in the wake of its failed bid for part of GlaxoSmithKline. Vodafone Group rose 4.7% after Reuters reported that the telecom is in talks with Iliad to combine their units in Italy.</p><p>Asian markets were mixed, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates pushed investors to reassess valuations of fast-growing technology companies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2%, the Shanghai Composite Index was flat and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%.</p><p>Chinese internet stocks came under pressure. Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group and JD.com fell 6.3% and 5.6%, respectively.</p><p>Still, Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Société Générale, said investors were returning to the battered Chinese internet sector, drawn by relatively low valuations and a changing regulatory environment. \"It seems that there is some stabilization in the regulation framework. Recent news has not been all bad for the Chinese internet sector,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Slip, Signaling More Market Volatility</p>",
