  "text": "<p>The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an urgent alert about the vulnerability and urged companies to take action. CISA Director Jen Easterly said Saturday, \"To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk. We will only minimize potential impacts through collaborative efforts between government and the private sector.\" Germany's cybersecurity organization over the weekend issued a \"red alert\" about the bug. Australia called the issue \"critical.\"</p><p>Security experts warned it could take weeks or more to assess the extent of the damage and that hackers exploiting the vulnerability could access sensitive data on networks and install back doors they could use to maintain access to servers even after the flawed software has been patched.</p><p>\"It is one of the most significant vulnerabilities that I've seen in a long time,\" said Aaron Portnoy, principal scientist with the security firm Randori.</p><p>Security experts noted that many companies have other processes in place that would prevent a malicious hacker from running software and breaking into these companies, potentially limiting the fallout from the bug.</p><p>Microsoft Corp., in an alert to customers, said \"attackers are probing all endpoints for vulnerability.\" Amazon.com Inc., Twitter Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. were among the companies that have said they were carrying out investigations into the depth of the problem.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest cloud computing company, said in a security alert, \"We are actively monitoring this issue and are working on addressing it.\"</p><p>The software flaw was reported late last month to the Log4j development team, a group of volunteer coders who distribute their software free of charge as part of the Apache Software Foundation, according to Ralph Goers, a volunteer with the project. The foundation, a nonprofit group that helps oversee the development of many open-source programs, alerted its user community about the vulnerability on Dec. 9.</p><p>\"It's a very critical issue,\" Mr. Goers said. \"People need to upgrade to get the fix,\" he said. Log4j is used on servers to keep records of users' activities so they can be reviewed later on by security or software development teams.</p><p>Because Log4j is distributed free, it is unclear how many servers are affected by the bug, but the logging software has been downloaded millions of times, Mr. Goers said.</p><p>Software providers that include Log4j in their products, such as International Business Machines Corp.'s Red Hat, Oracle Corp. and VMware Inc., have said they are deploying patches.</p><p>It isn't the first time that open-source software has sparked security concerns.</p><p>In 2014, internet users world-wide were urged to reset their passwords after another issue, known as Heartbleed, was discovered in OpenSSL, an obscure yet similarly ubiquitous piece of internet software built by volunteers.</p><p>Hackers started exploiting the flaw widely early Friday, including to gain access to servers running Microsoft's Minecraft gaming software, researchers said.</p><p>The researchers soon observed widespread scanning and attempts to trigger the Log4j bug across the Internet. In a note published Friday, Microsoft advised some Minecraft gamers that they should upgrade their software to patch the bug.</p><p>During a roughly 24-hour period, the security firm Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. said it saw more than 100,000 attempts to exploit the bug, about half of which it estimated were from malicious cyberattackers. The rest were by legitimate researchers, either governments scanning national infrastructure or security researchers, Check Point said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
