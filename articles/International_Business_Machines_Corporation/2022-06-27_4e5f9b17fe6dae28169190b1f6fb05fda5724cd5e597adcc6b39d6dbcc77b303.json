  "title": "U.S. News: BIS Warns Rates Must Rise Faster",
  "text": "<p>The world's central banks must raise interest rates sharply, even if it significantly hurts growth, the institution known as the central banks' central bank warned on Sunday. If they don't, the world risks a 1970s-style inflationary spiral, the Bank for International Settlements said in its annual report. Even if they do, the global economy could face a toxic combination of low or negative growth and high inflation, known as stagflation, it said.</p><p>The Federal Reserve this month increased its policy rate by 0.75 percentage point to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%, but it is still deeply negative in real terms, i.e. after adjusting for inflation. Central banks in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway have recently announced 0.5-percentage-point rises in interest rates, but their real policy rates remain far below zero.</p><p>\"Gradually raising policy rates at a pace that falls short of inflation increases means falling real interest rates. This is hard to reconcile with the need to keep inflation risks in check,\" the BIS said. \"Given the extent of the inflationary pressure unleashed over the past year, real policy rates will need to increase significantly in order to moderate demand.\"</p><p>Inflation erodes the value of money. If the interest rate is below the inflation rate, debtors pay back less than they borrowed, measured in terms of what that money can buy. That encourages people to borrow.</p><p>The Switzerland-based BIS, which acts as a bank and think tank for central banks, drew uncomfortable parallels with the 1970s. Then, as now, real policy rates fell far below zero, meaning central banks were stimulating rather than slowing economic activity as inflation surged.</p><p>Adding to the risks: Overvalued assets and high debt, which were much less of a concern in the 1970s, could magnify any growth slowdown. \"A modest slowdown may not be enough. Lowering inflation could involve significant output costs, as after the 'Great Inflation' of the 1970s,\" the BIS wrote.</p><p>The BIS has issued a series of warnings in recent years about an overreliance on easy money, but its advice went largely unheeded.</p><p>There are differences from the 1970s, too. Recent commodity-price rises are proportionally smaller, though spread across a broader range of goods, and commodity supply has so far held up better, the BIS said. Major central banks are now independent of governments and have a clear mandate to keep inflation at 2%, neither of which was true in the 1970s. Back then, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns was late to raise interest rates after coming under pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep unemployment low ahead of the 1972 presidential election.</p><p>Even so, the path of real rates in advanced economies over the past 12 months bears a striking resemblance to the 1970s, with large declines ahead of an oil-price shock, the BIS said. In most advanced economies, real rates are between 1 and 6 percentage points below their historical range over the past three decades, it said. \"At this stage, it's too early to say that the task [of central banks] has been completed,\" Agustin Carstens, general manager of the BIS, told reporters.</p><p>Earlier this month, Fed officials signaled they expect to raise their policy rate to between 3.5% and 4% next year. That would be a positive real rate if inflation returns to the Fed's target of 2%, but negative if instead inflation stays closer to current levels. They expect the unemployment rate to rise slightly, from 3.6% now to 4.1% in 2024. That scenario avoids a recession, though Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers this past week that a recession is possible.</p><p>The European Central Bank has signaled a gradual series of rate increases from the current level of minus 0.5%. Speaking to European lawmakers this month, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the bank planned to increase rates to more normal levels, but not higher. \"We certainly are not tightening monetary policy,\" Ms. Lagarde said. The ECB expects both unemployment and inflation to decline.</p><p>Given that inflation has spread to a broad variety of goods and services, such gentle policy moves are unlikely to work, said Stephen Cecchetti, a former senior BIS official who is now a finance professor at Brandeis International Business School. He estimates U.S. unemployment will likely need to reach 5% for several years to bring inflation down. \"The question is whether you can drive it all out in one recession, or if it could take more than one recession,\" Mr. Cecchetti said.</p><p>Another challenge: The longer high inflation persists, the more likely it is to remain high. People tend to ignore price increases when inflation is low but start paying more attention when it is high, and changing their behavior in response. Workers who have lost purchasing power seek larger wage rises.</p><p>In the U.S., wages are rising at an annual rate of about 6.1%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In Europe, wages are likely to be rising at an annual rate of 5% by year end, a pace that could be sustained through the end of 2023, according to economists at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>\"We may be reaching a tipping point, beyond which an inflationary psychology spreads and becomes entrenched,\" the BIS wrote. \"This would mean a major paradigm shift.\"</p>",
