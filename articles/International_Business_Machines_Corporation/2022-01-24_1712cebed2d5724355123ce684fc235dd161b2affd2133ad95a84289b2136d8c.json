  "text": "<p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 3.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4%, or about 800 points, putting the blue-chip index on track for its seventh consecutive day of losses.</p><p>Tesla, which is due to report earnings Wednesday, lost 8.5%. Shares of Moderna fell 11% and fellow vaccine maker Pfizer shed 4.7%. Chip maker Nvidia, one of last year's strongest performers, fell 8.3%. One of the few bright spots was Kohl's, which jumped 35% after a group backed by activist hedge fund Starboard Value offered roughly $9 billion to buy the department store chain.</p><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.719% from 1.747% Friday as investors fled to the safety of government bonds. Yields move in the opposite direction from prices. Last week, the 10-year yield hit its highest level in more than two years. Yields have risen this year as the Fed has moved closer to hiking interest rates, punishing speculative bets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies that flourished during a period of rock-bottom rates.</p><p>The losses in once-hot investments continued Monday. Bitcoin was trading at about $33,578, down more than 5% from its 5 p.m. ET level on Sunday. Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF, a big winner in 2020, fell 2.3%.</p><p>The biggest single factor driving yields up and stock prices down is the expectation that the Fed will raise rates multiple times in 2022 to rein in inflation, which is running at its fastest pace in 40 years. The central bank is set to gather for a two-day meeting Tuesday. At its conclusion on Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to signal that rates will likely rise as soon as March.</p><p>The Fed is concerned fast-rising consumer prices will become self-reinforcing by feeding into expectations of higher inflation, said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank. \"It is talking about tightening aggressively to get on top of that.\"</p><p>Mr. Graham-Taylor said he thinks inflation will fall this year and that the Fed won't raise rates as many times as the market expects.</p><p>Fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine are also weighing on markets, analysts said. The State Department on Sunday instructed the families of U.S. diplomats in Ukraine to leave the country, while the White House is considering sending several thousand troops to Europe.</p><p>Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said a conflict and its possible consequences—including the closure of the U.S. financial system to Russian banks—would play out in markets in unpredictable ways. \"The closer you get to the cliff, the more nervous [the market] is,\" Mr. Galy said. \"We don't have the information to trade.\"</p><p>Investors are looking ahead to a fresh batch of corporate earnings reports this week, including from some big tech companies. International Business Machines is due to report quarterly results after the closing bell on Monday, followed by General Electric, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla later in the week. About a fifth of companies on the S&amp;P 500 have filed results, and 82% have beaten analysts' expectations for earnings per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Oil prices, which had defied pressure on broader markets by rising to start 2022, got caught up in the selloff. Brent crude futures, the benchmark in international energy markets, fell 2.6% to $85.61 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas stock markets fell. The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled 3.7%, dragged down by shares of travel, leisure, and basic-resource companies.</p><p>Unilever, bucking the trend, jumped 7.2% after reports that activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had bought a stake in the packaged-food and consumer-goods company in the wake of its failed bid for part of GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>Asian markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index was flat and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%.</p><p>Chinese internet stocks came under pressure. Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group and JD.com fell 6.3% and 5.6%, respectively.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Drops to Correction Territory Amid Market Fall</p>",
