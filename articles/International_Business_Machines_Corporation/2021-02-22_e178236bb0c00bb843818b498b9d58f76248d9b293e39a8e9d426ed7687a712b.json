  "text": "<p>   At the firm, she says, she found strong professional support in honing her legal skills. Still, as the only Black attorney in the firm's L.A. office when she joined, \"I told myself that if I mess this up, they're never going to hire another Black lawyer.\" </p><p>   Her answer, Ms. Henry says, was to burrow into the work, aim to write the best briefs, and over time, more Black attorneys did join the office. Yet she says her focus on perfecting her legal skills hurt her ability to network and bring in business, and she worried how asking for help inside the firm would look. </p><p>   \"As an African-American attorney, do I really want to step up and say, 'I'm having trouble with this'?\" she says she asked herself. Instead, she turned to an outside mentoring network for midcareer women, whose guidance helped her boost her profitability. \"It's what I needed to have candid conversations about getting where I wanted to be,\" she says. </p><p>   In the wake of the racial-equity movement set off by the death of George Floyd in police custody, the killing of Breonna Taylor and other prominent cases involving Black Americans and police, some business leaders are redoubling efforts to create more career opportunities for Black people. Best Buy Co., whose headquarters is just miles from where Mr. Floyd was killed, pledged in December to fill one out of every three new salaried corporate jobs with people of color and increase retention with more career support. </p><p>    Target Corp., also based nearby, has committed to boosting the representation of Black employees across the company by 20% over the next three years and creating new career pathways -- in part because, as company officials drilled more deeply into employee data by race, it saw Black employees in many areas were leaving at higher rates than others. </p><p>   \"That tells you there's something systemic about the experience,\" says Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief diversity and inclusion officer, who says that both promotion data and employee surveys suggested Black employees wanted more career routes up and across the company. CEO Brian Cornell says having an effective strategy is critical to innovating for the retailer's diverse customer base. \"Simply put, we believe diverse and inclusive teams are the most successful,\" he says. </p><p>   Companies are also joining forces. A coalition of more than 30 CEOs from companies including Merck &amp; Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Nike Inc. are backing a startup, called OneTen, aimed at creating one million \"family sustaining\" jobs for Black Americans within a decade. The initiative, which will focus on helping those without a college degree train, find and retain jobs at the participating companies, is an acknowledgment by the CEOs that their racial-diversity efforts haven't made a meaningful difference for Black Americans, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, a OneTen founder, has said. One of just a handful of Black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies, Mr. Frazier is retiring in June. </p><p>   Part of the challenge in drawing more Black workers into upwardly mobile positions will be bridging the job-opportunity gap that exists well before many find their way into company workplaces. Blacks face higher unemployment and underemployment than other Americans, even among those with a college education, according to government data. </p><p>   Another issue is geography: Nearly 60% of the Black labor force lives in the South, federal data shows, while far fewer Blacks live in the West, where much of the booming tech industry is. In California, for example, less than 6% of the population is Black. Black populations are also relatively small in the kinds of cities expected to see the most job growth over the next decade, according to McKinsey, such as big new-economy hubs like Seattle and Austin; fast-growing second-tier cities like Provo, Utah; and areas seeing big inflows of middle-class and affluent seniors, such as Prescott, Ariz., and Ocean City, Md. </p><p>   Failing to address the gap is likely to widen the wealth disparity between Blacks and other Americans. Among Black private-sector workers, 43% earn less than $30,000 a year, compared with 31% of all employees, in part because they make up far more of low-paying service and laborer jobs, especially in the retail and hospitality sectors, the McKinsey data shows -- industries that have been especially devastated by the pandemic. Looking ahead, their high concentration in those fields puts 23% of jobs held by Black workers at risk of being displaced by automation over the next decade, McKinsey estimates, slightly more than whites and employees of Asian descent and slightly lower than the 25% for Hispanics. </p><p>   The relatively few Black professionals who make it into upper management fare better at promotions than those in earlier career stages, the McKinsey data shows. In the first half of last year, Black men, in particular, were promoted at higher rates than their white peers to senior positions, with the exception of executive teams. Still, the gains are uneven, partly because the numbers are so small. Virtually no Black women at the senior vice president level were promoted during that same period within the two dozen companies McKinsey studied. </p><p>   Gwen Kelly, now in her 60s, says that throughout her marketing career she often felt she was two to three promotions behind her white peers. Before she was recruited by an ad agency to serve in her first director-level position, she says, the firm first discussed the decision with a major client. \"They wanted to gauge their reaction,\" she says. </p><p>   Later she worked in insurance and then for Walmart, first as a marketing executive and ultimately in the company's diversity office. But her discussions with managers about advancing further didn't lead to higher positions, though she says she often did more senior-level work. </p><p>   Though she saw some Black women rise through the ranks, Ms. Kelly says she lacked higher-up sponsors who could champion her for bigger roles. \"You can't say there weren't people like that. I just wasn't the one that was chosen,\" she says, adding that she also didn't know how to seek out such advocates. \"There's ignorance on both sides,\" says Ms. Kelly, who left Walmart in 2018 and is now a marketing consultant in Bentonville, Ark. </p><p>   Walmart says it has been expanding its efforts to bolster diversity through its ranks, including, in more recent years, requiring that both internal and external shortlists for senior roles include at least one woman or person of color and making it easier for employees to find sponsors. It also is publishing more detailed breakdowns of the racial and ethnic makeup of its workforce on all levels. </p><p>   \"We're not going to move the needle if we're not all transparent,\" says Donna Morris, Walmart's chief people officer. In the first half of Walmart's past fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, Black employees, who make up 11.6% of managers, got 17% of all promotions from one management level to another and 18% of promotions from hourly jobs to manager roles. </p><p>   On the other end of the spectrum, more than 25,000 Walmart employees -- 47% of them people of color -- have participated in Live Better U, a company-sponsored online higher-education program Walmart founded in 2018. For $1 a day, employees can enroll in online courses and earn degrees and trade certificates putting them on track for higher-level jobs. </p><p>   One is 34-year-old Courtney Stingley, who began working at Walmart nine years ago as an electronics sales associate at the store in his hometown, Forest, Miss. He took on other department roles and got a taste for managing others as an overnight supervisor in another store. But his applications for a manager role that came with a salary, not hourly wages, went nowhere. \"My education was holding me back,\" says Mr. Stingley, who had a two-year associate degree in drafting and design technology. </p><p>   Enrolling in the Live Better U program in 2018 and taking the online courses in his off hours, he graduated last October with a bachelor's degree in supply chain, transportation and logistics management. One week after applying for a logistics load manager job at Walmart's Bentonville headquarters, he got the job, and his salary is now double the wages he made before, he says. </p><p>   After knowing nearly every role and function in the stores, managing logistics at a regional level has been a culture shock, he says. \"There, I was the go-to for everything; here, I'm starting all over again, but it has been very educational for me,\" says Mr. Stingley, who says he wants to eventually go into human resources. \"It has opened my eyes to the reasons I'm actually here.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Fuhrmans, deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal's management bureau, can be reached at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com.
