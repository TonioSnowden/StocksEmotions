  "text": "<p>Three of the hottest letters in ESG are SDG.</p><p>As executives navigate a crowded landscape of environmental, social and governance, or ESG, frameworks, more and more are turning for guidance to the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, that the United Nations established in 2015.</p><p>\"There is growing demand among corporations and investors to use the SDGs as a road map,\" says Cathy Clark, a professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.</p><p>She isn't surprised. Because all 193 member countries of the U.N. have adopted the SDGs, it gives business leaders who are struggling for a common way to gauge and disclose their companies' social and environmental impact an opportunity to show \"we're aligning with the consensus-driven values across the globe,\" Ms. Clark says. \"This is the to-do list for the planet.\"</p><p>Management Top 250</p><p>* Explore the full ranking</p><p>With this in mind, we've added to the Drucker Institute's measure of corporate effectiveness this year a new metric that assesses how well a company's actions match up against the SDGs. Our mathematical model, which now includes a total of 34 metrics, serves as the basis for the Management Top 250, a ranking produced annually with The Wall Street Journal since 2017. It rests on the core teachings of Peter Drucker, the late management scholar.</p><p>A big agenda</p><p>There are 17 SDGs that together form, in the U.N.'s words, \"the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.\" It is a broad and incredibly ambitious agenda meant to be tackled by 2030: ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, taking urgent action to combat climate change, promoting decent jobs and inclusive economic growth, fostering peaceful and just societies with accountable institutions, and much more.</p><p>The SDGs are also being used to help generate new guideposts for corporate reporting. For example, the International Business Council has released a set of \"stakeholder capitalism\" metrics, which more than 100 companies have signed on to, that are grounded in the SDGs.</p><p>In the Drucker Institute's model, the SDG rating falls into our social responsibility category, one of five areas of corporate performance that we evaluate, alongside customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation and financial strength. It is supplied by HIP Investor, which analyzes stocks, bonds and other assets not only for their future risk and return potential but also for their positive and negative effects on people and the planet.</p><p>As with every change to our model, we took great care to ensure that what we wanted to introduce was a good statistical fit. The correlation coefficient between HIP's SDG rating and the overall dimension of social responsibility is, at 0.92, exceedingly robust. This type of correlation ranges from negative 1 (signaling that two variables move in completely opposite directions) to positive 1 (whereby they move in perfect lockstep). Zero means there is no relationship whatsoever.</p><p>What's more, adding the SDG metric boosted the correlation between social responsibility and total corporate effectiveness to 0.79 from 0.76 last year. We define effectiveness as Mr. Drucker did: \"doing the right things well.\"</p><p>Reality check</p><p>A focus on the SDGs can spur companies to act in ways that they might not have otherwise. Bank of America Corp., which has the 11th-highest SDG rating among the 846 companies in our 2021 rankings, says it was inspired by the SDGs to issue last year an Equality Progress Sustainability Bond, proceeds from which will be used to finance environmental projects and help reduce inequalities in Black and Hispanic communities.</p><p>\"There is an important discussion under way about the role capitalism plays in our society and the ways in which it must evolve to ensure all participants in our economic system are treated fairly,\" says Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. \"Public companies have an important role to play to help drive that discussion.\"</p><p>Figuring out how faithfully or not a company adheres to the SDGs isn't simple. Underlying the U.N.'s 17 big goals are 231 separate indicators. But some of them, such as those connected to peace and justice, don't apply directly to corporations. Others that are pertinent to business are unobtainable because of a lack of corporate transparency.</p><p>In the end, HIP was able to create a rating with 62 indicators across the 17 SDGs by using a combination of the U.N.'s methodology and various proxies. The HIP metric covers 841 of the 846 large, publicly traded U.S. companies we tracked this year.</p><p>As with many other facets of ESG, companies have been known to let their rhetoric around the SDGs outpace reality. \"There is a very large gap between 'I intend to address the SDGs' and 'I'm actually implementing the SDGs in ways that you can trust,' \" Ms. Clark says.</p><p>In fact, while more than 70% of large companies have mentioned the SDGs in official corporate reports, according to a 2019 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, few have made a serious commitment to meeting them.</p><p>\"Industry by industry, the results are really abysmal,\" says Mark Kramer, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and a member of the supervisory board of the World Benchmarking Alliance, which represents organizations looking to shape the private sector's contributions toward the SDGs.</p><p>R. Paul Herman, HIP Investor's chief executive, says his team pays close attention to the quality of a company's SDG-related reporting. Claims that are opaque or not backed by hard data score low in HIP's system. \"We try to pinpoint who's authentically doing something versus asserting they're doing something,\" he says.</p><p>Many experts expect that, over time, ESG reporting by companies will become increasingly standardized and auditable, and that will help tamp down inflated claims in this arena.</p><p>But, in the meantime, Mr. Herman points to another virtue of the SDGs: Their expansive nature, which extends beyond the scope of corporate activity per se, is a good reminder of how interconnected our world is. \"If we don't solve the SDGs,\" Mr. Herman says, \"you won't be able to run a business.\"</p><p>It is a view that Mr. Drucker would have certainly appreciated. As he himself wrote in 1973, long before anybody had heard the term ESG: \"A healthy businessâ€¦cannot exist in a sick society.\"</p><p>Mr. Wartzman is the head of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, a part of the Drucker Institute, and Ms. Tang is the institute's senior director of research.
