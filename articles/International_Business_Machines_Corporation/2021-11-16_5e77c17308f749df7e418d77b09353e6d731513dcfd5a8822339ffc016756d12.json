  "title": "Hungary's OTP Bank Invests in AI Supercomputer; The system, developed by Silicon Valley's SambaNova, will leverage AI language models to automate more banking services for Hungarian speakers",
  "text": "<p>The move, announced last week, comes as the European market trails behind the U.S. and China in building faster, more powerful computers, a race many global leaders see as an issue of national security.</p><p>OTP Bank said its system will be made available as a public-sector resource. The company will work with Hungary's Ministry for Innovation and Technology to provide AI-driven capabilities for government agencies, universities, research hospitals and other organizations.</p><p>Because of the bank's sprawling regional presence, many of the new capabilities will also be shared with neighboring countries, said Péter Csányi, the bank's deputy chief executive and head of its digital division. OTP Bank is the flagship bank of OTP Group, which currently has some 17 million customers within a network of more than 1,700 branches in 11 countries, including Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>\"This is a big and bold step for us,\" Mr. Csányi said. \"It's not a one-country show.\"</p><p>OTP Bank's system is being built by Palo Alto, Calif.-based SambaNova Systems Inc., a four-year-old tech firm backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc., Intel Capital and other high-profile investors.</p><p>SambaNova is providing the bank with an integrated full-stack software and hardware platform on a subscription basis. The platform is designed to get future AI projects up and running in a matter of weeks, rather than months, the company said.</p><p>\"What we're building is a set of capabilities that most commercial enterprises cannot build themselves,\" said Marshall Choy, SambaNova's vice president of product. \"We're talking about a multi-rack deployment across multiple sites and operating as a single distributed system,\" he said.</p><p>Supercomputers are designed to handle massive amounts of data and computations at lightning speeds, typically in fields like engineering, science and medical research. Fugaku, a record-fast supercomputer at the Riken Center for Computational Science research facility in Kobe, Japan, operates more than 1,000 times faster than a regular computer, according to the Japanese scientific research center.</p><p>They consist of room-sized hardware units housing thousands of nodes connected through high-performance network technologies. By linking the nodes into giant networks, digital workloads can be chopped up into smaller tasks, enabling the computer to tackle many tasks at the same time and dramatically increase processing speeds. By handling massive amounts of data, supercomputers are especially powerful for running AI models.</p><p>Over the past year, researchers working on a range of issues related to Covid-19 have leveraged supercomputer capabilities created by pooling resources from International Business Machines Corp., Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp. and other giant tech firms.</p><p>A supercomputer is also being used in efforts to map the universe.</p><p>The global market for supercomputers, which typically cost more than $3 million, is expected to reach a total of $5.9 billion this year and grow at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 10% until 2024, according to research firm Hyperion Research. Giant exascale supercomputers cost hundreds of millions of dollars, while the Fugaku system alone costs more than $1 billion, industry analysts estimate.</p><p>China and the U.S. currently account for nearly two-thirds of the world's 500 fastest supercomputer systems, while Europe has just over 100, said Peter Rutten, a research director at International Data Corp.'s performance-intensive computing infrastructure systems, platforms and technologies group. The booming AI market is putting the development of these systems into high gear, he added.</p><p>\"AI is driven by corporations, less by governments, and both the U.S. and China have very large enterprises, especially in the hyperscale space, that have invested large amounts in AI development,\" Mr. Rutten said. \"European corporations tend to follow the U.S. in innovation,\" he said.</p><p>\"I doubt that OTP Group's supercomputer would qualify for the Top 500 largest supercomputers, but it is a very interesting system because it is built with technology from a U.S.-based AI startup,\" Mr. Rutten said.</p><p>The system, which will run in OTP Bank's data center in Hungary, is expected to be deployed in early 2022, SambaNova said. Mr. Choy said the move enables the bank to jump ahead in the development of AI across Europe, \"and indeed in global efforts.</p><p>\"Europe is a little bit behind in digital development,\" Mr. Csányi said. Investing in an AI supercomputer \"will help us adjust to a changing world.\"</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p>",
