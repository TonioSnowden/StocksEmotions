  "text": "<p>Howard Schultz created buzz on his first day back at Starbucks as interim CEO. On Monday, he suspended billions of dollars in share repurchases and said that his focus would be on the coffee chain's cafes, customers and employees rather than the stock market. Mr. Schultz said Starbucks must grow faster and redesign its store experience to be more relevant to consumers -- even if that means sacrificing quarterly earnings and shareholder returns in the short term. The company faces a unionization push among its U.S. baristas. Starbucks shares fell 3.7% Monday.</p><p>SPIRIT AIRLINES INC.</p><p>SAVE +22%</p><p>Another discount airline is swooping down on Spirit. JetBlue Airways Corp. offered to buy the ultralow-cost carrier for roughly $3.6 billion, Spirit said Tuesday, challenging rival Frontier Group Holdings Inc. Spirit already struck a $2.9 billion cash-and-stock merger agreement with Frontier announced in February -- a deal that would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline. Spirit said late Thursday it would entertain its new suitor's unsolicited bid, but that its agreement with Frontier remains in place and its board continues to recommend it. Spirit shares soared 22% Tuesday.</p><p>TWITTER INC.</p><p>TWTR +27%</p><p>Elon Musk is ruffling feathers at Twitter. The CEO of Tesla Inc. will join the social-media platform's board after Mr. Musk on Monday revealed his 9.2% stake in the company. Twitter also said on Wednesday it is working on adding an edit button -- a function long-requested by many users -- after Mr. Musk on Monday polled his Twitter followers on the feature. Twitter shares gained 27% Monday.</p><p>SHELL PLC</p><p>SHEL +0.2%</p><p>Shell expects a stain from its Russia exit. The London-based oil giant on Thursday said it anticipates accounting charges from $4 billion to $5 billion in its first quarter related to its decision to cut Russia ties in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine. The disclosure gives investors more clues about the effects Western companies face as they divorce themselves from Russia. Beyond the impact of the Russia exit, Shell said it expects to report strong first-quarter earnings in its large liquefied-natural-gas business, as well as from oil and gas trading. Shell shares added 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>CONAGRA BRANDS INC.</p><p>CAG +0.3%</p><p>Inflation is still eating up the maker of Slim Jims. Rising costs of ingredients and trucking pushed Conagra to raise product prices again, as the food industry fights higher supply-chain costs driven by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The food manufacturer now expects inflation in the current quarter to be \"an unprecedented 26%\" higher than two years earlier, CEO Sean Connolly said. Conagra's profit took a hit in the quarter ended Feb. 27, as its costs soared more than expected. Mr. Connolly said demand among shoppers remains strong. Conagra shares rose 0.3% Thursday.</p><p>HP INC.</p><p>HPQ +15%</p><p>Warren Buffett, once wary of technology companies, is doubling down on computer hardware. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed in securities filings Wednesday that it built a stake of more than 11% in computer-and-printer maker HP. The holding -- worth more than $4.2 billion, based on HP's Wednesday closing price -- marks another foray into computing by the billionaire investor, who also has big positions in IBM and Apple. Berkshire also agreed this year to buy insurer Alleghany Corp. and boosted its position in Occidental Petroleum Corp. HP shares surged 15% Thursday.</p><p>WALMART INC.</p><p>WMT +0.6%</p><p>Walmart is paying up to keep on trucking. The retail giant is offering up to $110,000 starting salaries for truck drivers and expanding a training program that enables its employees to enter the field to grow its in-house fleet. The push comes as the trucking industry struggles with recruitment even as wages rose steadily during the pandemic. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target Corp. are taking on more responsibilities within their supply chains and, in some cases, taking over tasks once handled by third parties. Walmart shares rose 0.6% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
