  "text": "<p>Top tech executives including Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc.'s Andy Jassy, Microsoft Corp.'s Satya Nadella and Alphabet Inc.'s Sundar Pichai attended the White House meeting, according to a list of participants shared by an administration official. The guest list also included JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, and Brian Moynihan, president and CEO of Bank of America Corp., among other representatives of the financial industry.</p><p>The summit came as Mr. Biden is overseeing an evacuation of Americans from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. The president has attempted to reorient national security priorities around what his senior advisers have said are the top strategic threats of the coming decades, including cybersecurity, competition with China and Russia's efforts to destabilize Western stability and alliances.</p><p>Speaking to reporters briefly at the start of the meeting, Mr. Biden highlighted estimates that roughly half a million cybersecurity jobs in the U.S. are unfilled and stressed that the private sector needs to do more to safeguard digital systems from criminal and state-backed hackers and spies.</p><p>\"The federal government can't meet this challenge alone,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've invited you all here because you have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.\"</p><p>The summit was the first high-profile meeting Mr. Biden has had as president with the private sector to discuss cybersecurity. Senior White House officials have said for months that the problem is one of shared responsibility between government and industries -- particularly those responsible for operating the nation's critical infrastructure -- and recently suggested the administration could look to pursue mandates if voluntary security standards aren't widely adopted.</p><p>Mr. Biden in the early months of his administration highlighted cybersecurity as a top national security concern in the wake of a Russian espionage operation, discovered in the final months of the Trump administration, that compromised at least 10 federal agencies and 100 U.S. companies.</p><p>The issue grew more pronounced as a threat this spring and summer after a spree of high-profile ransomware attacks forced the shutdowns of a major U.S. fuel pipeline, a large meat distributor and a range of small businesses.</p><p>Some companies attending the meeting announced initiatives aimed at bolstering cybersecurity and expanding job training and education.</p><p>Microsoft pledged to invest $20 billion over the next five years to bake security into the basic design of products, a fourfold increase over its previous commitment, and said it would make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state and local governments modernize technology. Google promised to put $10 billion toward cyber improvements over five years and train 100,000 people in information technology and data analytics. International Business Machines Corp. said it would help educate at least 150,000 people in cybersecurity over three years.</p>",
