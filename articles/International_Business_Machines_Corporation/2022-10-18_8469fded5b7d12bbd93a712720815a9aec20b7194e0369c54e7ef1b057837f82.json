  "text": "<p>   After Mr. Xi's efforts to make China less reliant on foreign technologies, the country is now able to make about 26% of the semiconductors it needs, up from 13% in 2017, according to Handel Jones, chief executive officer of consulting firm International Business Strategies. </p><p>   Those are less complicated chips. Despite billions of dollars in investments over the past 10 years, China has failed to mass-produce higher-end chips. </p><p>   A state-led push to develop China's first large commercial passenger jet has shown limited progress after a decade of investments. The aircraft recently cleared one of a series of regulatory hurdles to begin carrying passengers, but industry experts say it remains years away from commercial service. </p><p>   Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of research firm Gavekal Dragonomics who has written extensively about China's economy, said he's becoming more negative about China's outlook given the limited benefits from its technology-centric industrial policy. </p><p>   \"The declared strategy can boost certain sectors such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, but is not enough to create economywide productivity growth,\" he said. </p><p>   Increased regulatory screening of foreign investments, for national security reasons, has led to more multinationals leaving or planning to divest from China. Despite government data showing continued strong foreign investment flows into China, the Rhodium-Atlantic Council study finds that foreign direct investment as a share of China's GDP has declined steadily, to 21% last year from nearly 30% a decade earlier. </p><p>   A survey released in August by the U.S.-China Business Council of 117 American companies operating in China showed that business optimism had reached record lows. Some 8% of the companies polled had shifted parts of their supply chains out of China to the U.S., according to the survey, while another 16% had moved some operations to other countries. </p><p>   \"A lot of people are not sure if economic development will continue to be the central task of the party,\" said Mao Zhenhua, chairman and founder of rating agency China Chengxin Credit Co., at an economic forum held in Beijing in June, according to a transcript. \"Some course correction is needed for the economy to be back on the right track.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Karen Hao and Rachel Liang contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
