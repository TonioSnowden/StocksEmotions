  "title": "Aviation Maverick Started Helicopter Company From Scratch; Engineer Frank Robinson designed small helicopters in his living room after aviation companies passed on his ideas",
  "text": "<p>\"Nobody really focused on the civilian market. He went ahead and did it,\" said Kurt Robinson, the company's president and Mr. Robinson's son.</p><p>Since its first two-seat models were shipped to customers in the early 1980s, Robinson Helicopter has produced more than 13,500 helicopters and now employs more than 1,000 people. The company said 70% of its orders are from overseas buyers. Robinson now makes three helicopter models, some with more powerful engines for specialized duties and larger cabins for seating for four or five people.</p><p>Mr. Robinson, who retired from the company in 2010, died Nov. 12 at his home in Rolling Hills, Calif. He was 92 years old and had dementia, his family said.</p><p>Born in Carbonado, Wash., Mr. Robinson was the youngest of four children in a family where his father worked as a coal miner and later operated a boat house. Kurt Robinson said his father's interest in helicopters started in the late 1930s, when he saw a newspaper picture of aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky hovering in a helicopter prototype.</p><p>He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington in 1957 and went to work for Cessna Aircraft Co. Mr. Robinson later cycled through helicopter programs for other aviation companies, including at Kaman Corp., Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter Co. and Hughes Aircraft. He worked on tail rotor design for Hughes's MD 500 model, the civilian version of a light observation helicopter used by the Army during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Mr. Robinson urged executives at Bell and Hughes to pursue more civilian-specific helicopters, rather than just remarketing expensive military choppers for commercial use. His ideas attracted no interest from the companies.</p><p>\"All the helicopter companies in the '60s and '70s were really focused on the military,\" Kurt Robinson said. \"Frank was interested in personal helicopters.\"</p><p>Mr. Robinson quit Hughes in 1973 to pursue his own helicopters. As a single parent with four children at the time, he retreated to his house in Palos Verdes, Calif., where he started Robinson Helicopter. He and a couple of engineers worked on designs in his living room for the next two years. Their goal was to design a personal-use helicopter that could be priced below $50,000. The cheapest civilian helicopter at the time cost more than twice as much.</p><p>Mr. Robinson stopped buying shoes to reduce his expenses since he didn't need to wear shoes in his home, he recalled in a Dow Jones Newswires interview in 2000. He mortgaged his home to pay for a prototype that he started building in his garage. When that work ran afoul of local officials, Mr. Robinson moved the project to a Torrance airport hangar. He personally piloted the first flight of the prototype in 1975, and the Federal Aviation Administration certified it for sales in 1979.</p><p>More Obituaries</p><p>* Executive Managed Seminal Computer System at IBM</p><p>* Michael Maccoby Applied Psychology and Anthropology to Business</p><p>* Alvin Segal Made Peerless a Giant in Suits and Sport Coats</p><p>* Ela Bhatt, Organizer of India's Women Workers, Dies at 89</p><p>The R22 was a hit with customers in the early 1980s, attracting unexpected demand from flight schools as a trainer for helicopter pilots. Kurt Robinson said the company's helicopters currently are the most used in the world for training pilots.</p><p>The latest R22 model is priced at $330,000. The closely held company, which didn't turn its first annual profit until 1987, said it now has annual revenue of about $250 million, and is the market leader in helicopters priced below $1 million.</p><p>Colleagues said Mr. Robinson considered himself an aviation-industry maverick after his ideas were dismissed by the industry's establishment. He mostly avoided hiring engineers and executives from other aircraft companies in favor of developing young engineers and managers from in-house staff.</p><p>\"Frank promised me I'd learn how to fly, so it was an easy sell,\" said Peter Riedl, Robinson's vice president of engineering, who said he joined the company in 1986 fresh out of college.</p><p>As orders grew during the 1980s, Mr. Robinson faced the challenge of expanding production and introducing larger models while sticking to the affordability and simple designs that attracted customers to the Robinson brand.</p><p>\"The engineers here argue about the ounces and they argue about pennies. That's always been the mantra,\" Kurt Robinson said.</p><p>The company introduced the four-seat R44—a larger version of the R22—in the early 1990s. Upsizing the R22 required the aircraft's steering system to be re-engineered for heavier loads. Mr. Robinson settled on electrical-mechanical controls after nearly crashing while test flying an R44 with hydraulic controls. \"Frank was involved in all aspects of the design and testing of the helicopters,\" Mr. Riedl said. \"That was his passion.\"</p><p>The R44 quickly became Robinson's bestselling model by the end of the 1990s with specialized variants, including a news helicopter with cameras. The company came out with its largest and most powerful model in 2010 with the five-seat R66, which is powered by a turbine engine from Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC.</p><p>Robinson Helicopter has come under investigation by federal transportation regulators over the years because of fatal crashes involving the R22 and R44 models. Some crash investigations cited design problems with the main rotor under certain conditions as a possible factor. In the mid-1990s, the FAA required special awareness training for pilots of Robinson helicopters after determining the crashes were largely caused by pilot errors. Mr. Robinson began a safety course for helicopter pilots starting in the 1980s, and the company said 30,000 pilots have completed the course.</p><p>\"A helicopter is more difficult to fly than an airplane,\" said Kurt Robinson. \"If you're going to create something, you have to be part of all aspects of it.\"</p><p>Mr. Robinson was preceded in death by his wife and is survived by six children.</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>Aviation Maverick Started Helicopter Company From Scratch</p>",
