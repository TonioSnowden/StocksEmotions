  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked down 6.26 points, or 0.02%, to 35603.08. Shares of International Business Machines, a Dow component, fell $13.57, or 9.6%, to $128.33. The company reported weaker revenue than analysts had expected in the latest quarter.</p><p>\"The craziest thing about what I see going on in markets is just an absolute tug of war between growth and value investments,\" said Jeff Powell, managing partner and chief investment officer at Polaris Wealth Advisory Group. \"I've not seen a market like this in a really long time.\"</p><p>Stocks have risen in recent days after solid earnings helped quell concerns that sent markets lower at the start of fall. Among those worries: a slowdown in China's economy, supply-chain blockages that have hampered sectors such as manufacturing and inflation pressures.</p><p>Data showed jobless claims fell to a pandemic low last week. Filings for initial unemployment benefits fell to 290,000 from 296,000 the week before, the Labor Department said. Meanwhile, existing-home sales rebounded in September, rising 7% from the prior month.</p><p>The shared-office company WeWork started trading publicly, two years after its planned initial public offering imploded. The company went public through a combination with BowX Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company. Shares rose $1.40, or 13%, to $11.78.</p><p>AT&amp;T shares fell 15 cents, or 0.6%, to $25.76 after the company said it expected full-year earnings to reach the high end of its target. Blackstone shares gained $3.83, or 3%, to $132.52 on net income that almost doubled in the third quarter.</p><p>Of the 80 companies on the S&amp;P 500 to have reported through Wednesday, 81% had topped analysts' earnings forecasts, according to FactSet, better than the roughly 75% that did so each quarter in 2019.</p><p>\"We've gone through a period of hesitation that's brought a bit of volatility, but I think stocks will keep trending higher,\" said Paul Jackson, head of asset allocation research at Invesco. He expects households to keep spending savings accumulated during the pandemic.</p><p>HP raised its dividend and outlook for the 2022 fiscal year, and shares jumped $1.98, or 6.9%, to $30.57. Tesla added $28.20, or 3.3%, to $894 after the auto maker said late Wednesday it had notched a third-straight record quarterly profit.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly lower Thursday. Shares of China Evergrande Group slumped 13% in Hong Kong after the developer canceled plans to sell a majority stake in its property-management unit, a setback in attempts to ease its cash crisis.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.1%, weighed down by stocks in the basic-resources, auto and industrial sectors. Mining companies Anglo American and BHP Group both fell, and copper prices pulled back from recent highs.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.674%. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, lost $1.21, or 1.4%, to $84.61 a barrel. It was still the fourth-highest settlement value of this year.</p><p>Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.1%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.1%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
