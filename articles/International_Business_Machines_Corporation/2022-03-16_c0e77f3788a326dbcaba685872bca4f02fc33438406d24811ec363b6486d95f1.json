  "title": "Russia Sanctions Forcing Banks to Quickly Adapt; Financial institutions face myriad challenges following up on rapid-fire directives from various governments",
  "text": "<p>Daniel Gutierrez, co-chair of the legal and regulatory affairs committee at the Financial &amp; International Business Association trade group, said the challenges range from validating names of individuals and entities, to understanding executive orders and general licenses allowing certain activities, to working with complicated correspondent banking relationships.</p><p>As regulatory risk manager at Ocean Bank in Miami, Mr. Gutierrez said he and his team are tackling aspects of sanctions against Russia as they are introduced, including with one person monitoring the Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list and another monitoring anti-money-laundering alerts.</p><p>The U.S. and its allies have imposed economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia and Belarus in recent weeks, including blacklisting key Russian state-owned banks. The sanctions regimes among jurisdictions, however, differ with regard to who and what is listed.</p><p>To comply with sanctions, financial institutions rely on vendors for blacklists to help screen their clients and transactions. But questions remain about how fast the lists are revised, industry experts said.</p><p>\"Given the pace of these new designations, if you are using a third-party screening service provider, you should talk to your vendor to see how quickly they are updating the restricted party list they are using,\" said Claire Yi, an attorney at the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, during a recent webinar on Russia sanctions.</p><p>Risk data provider ComplyAdvantage said on its website on Tuesday it has added hundreds of entities from various sanctions regimes to its platform in recent weeks. The London-based company updates its list based on published sanctions lists and speeches by officials and news releases on those who are about to be sanctioned, said Charles Delingpole, the founder and chief executive of ComplyAdvantage. Its technology checks important sources every minute and has been able to update its data within 17 minutes, he added.</p><p>Industry experts say banks and financial institutions also need to communicate the importance of compliance across their units.</p><p>Entities not complying with sanctions face significant reputational risks in addition to financial penalties, and some banks are \"slow-walking\" payments believed to be of higher risk and, in some cases, reviewing them manually, said Tom Best, a partner specializing in white-collar defense and compliance at law firm Paul Hastings LLP.</p><p>\"It's a fact that Ukraine as a country is higher risk now than it was before the tanks started to roll,\" he said.</p><p>Sanctions on Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions pose a unique challenge, Mr. Best added.</p><p>Moscow has recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent \"people's republics\" and deployed troops there. The Biden administration in response imposed comprehensive sanctions on the regions, barring transactions or trade with individuals or entities there. But there isn't a list of individuals or entities in those areas and internet protocol addresses used for online services aren't precise enough to show specific parts of Ukraine.</p><p>While many banks have been using geographical location software and maps to ensure payments into Ukraine aren't going into regions under embargo, the tools are imperfect and illicit actors can manipulate them, Mr. Best said.</p><p>\"Financial institutions are having to balance the risk that their compliance controls cannot ensure to 100% accuracy that payments are not flowing to persons or entities in the comprehensively sanctioned regions, against the reputational and ethical risks of restricting innocent individuals' access to their own funds at a time when they are urgently needed,\" Mr. Best said.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Sanctions Forcing Banks to Quickly Adapt</p>",
