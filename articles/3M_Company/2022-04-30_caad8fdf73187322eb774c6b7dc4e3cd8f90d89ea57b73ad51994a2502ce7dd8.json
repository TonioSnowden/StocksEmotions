  "text": "<p>The auction page for the drawing – dubbed \"my political journal\" – showed at least two active bids. The top bid for 1.25 ether – a prominent cryptocurrency token – is worth nearly $3,600.</p><p>\"The auction for the #NFT of my political cartoon that @elonmusk shared (230K retweets, 1.3M likes) is currently at 1.25 $ETH! There are 13 days left to bid, so don't miss your chance to own a bit of internet history!\" Wright wrote in an update on Friday afternoon.</p><p>Musk caused a stir on Thursday when he tweeted out Wright's cartoon. It depicts a stick figure standing slightly left-of-center on the political spectrum as of 2008 – only to end up as right-leaning conservative in 2021 as a figure labeled \"woke progressive\" gradually moved further left during the intervening years.</p><p>Musk, who is in the process of buying Twitter for $44 billion, later elaborated on his political stance, noting he was a staunch supporter of Democratic former President Barack Obama. However, he asserted the current Democratic party has been \"hijacked by extremists.\"</p><p>\"The far left hates everyone, themselves included!\" Musk tweeted Friday morning.</p><p>Musk followed minutes later, adding, \"But I'm no fan of the far right either. Let's have less hate and more love.\"</p><p>The NFT auction isn't Wright's only effort to monetize the cartoon. In a post thanking Musk for his post, he also posted an Etsy listing for a mug depicting the political doodle.</p><p>In another tweet, Wright said he \"really [loved] the discussion it has kindled.\"</p><p>\"Though admittedly simplistic, I think it speaks to a truth many feel. Of course, politics are more complex than can be captured in a political cartoon with stick figures,\" he said.</p><p>Musk's decision to share the drawing further roiled left-leaning Twitter users and pundits, who have already expressed concern that his dedication to free speech absolutism will clear the way for more abusive and harmful posts on the platform.</p><p>This article was first published on NYPost.com</p><p>Political cartoon shared by Elon Musk is being sold as an NFT</p>",
