  "title": "U.S. News: 3M Earplugs Are Focus Of Massive Set of Suits",
  "text": "<p>Sgt. Butler, 31 years old, is among more than 200,000 service members and veterans who are suing 3M Co., saying it knowingly sold defective earplugs that caused their hearing problems. The first trial, which combines the cases of three Army veterans, has opened in federal court in Pensacola, Fla., and is expected to last through April.</p><p>The claims have been consolidated before a U.S. district judge in Florida in what is known as multidistrict litigation. The number of earplug plaintiffs dwarfs those currently alleging harm from any other product or drug, including weedkiller, baby powder and blood thinners.</p><p>\"They didn't warn about the risks,\" Florida attorney Bryan Aylstock said during opening statements late last month. \"And because of that, these three soldiers have hearing damage, and they're going to suffer with it for the rest of their life.\"</p><p>Minnesota-based 3M, which makes products ranging from N95 face masks to tape, said in a statement the earplugs weren't defective. Its design reflected features the military requested, and the U.S. government not only had input in the products' creation but also was responsible for training soldiers to use them, the company said.</p><p>\"It's not like you can just hand them out and say, 'Use this product, you're going to be good,' \" Mike Brock, an attorney for 3M, said during opening statements. \"It has to be fit properly.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the Defense Department, which isn't a party to the suits, declined to comment on ongoing litigation.</p><p>The trial is one of three scheduled this year to give 3M and plaintiffs' lawyers a sense of how jurors react to their competing narratives. If any trials end in large plaintiff awards, 3M could face building momentum and pressure to settle. A win in court by the company would likely extend the time before any resolution.</p><p>The lawsuits question the safety of a uniquely shaped earplug that 3M and a company it acquired, Aearo Technologies, made from 1999 to 2015. The military bought millions of the earplugs, which had an olive green side designed to block sound fully and a yellow end meant to let in nearby voices while shielding the ear from more harmful ballistic noises.</p><p>The service members allege that the company knew for years that the second version of its Combat Arms Earplugs had a tendency to come loose and let in more sound than specified. They claim that 3M didn't give the military adequate instructions on how to use the earplugs and that the technique to create a proper fit wasn't intuitive.</p><p>Mr. Brock, 3M's lawyer, said he would show that the veterans whose cases are being heard in Pensacola can't prove that they used the Combat Arms Earplugs for a significant period or that the plugs are the cause of their hearing problems.</p>",
