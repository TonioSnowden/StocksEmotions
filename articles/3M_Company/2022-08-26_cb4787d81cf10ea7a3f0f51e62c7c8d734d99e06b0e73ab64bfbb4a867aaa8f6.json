  "text": "<p>The judge's ruling denied 3M's attempt to shift the earplug lawsuits to bankruptcy court to drive a settlement of allegations the product was defective and left U.S. military veterans with lasting hearing damage.</p><p>3M didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. It has denied that the earplugs are unsafe and said bankruptcy offers the best forum to resolve its earplug liabilities.</p><p>Shares in 3M fell 9.2% to $129.80 in late afternoon trading.</p><p>Write to Akiko Matsuda at akiko.matsuda@wsj.com</p>",
