  "title": "3M's Suit Against Rival Led to Own Liability Woe",
  "text": "<p>The company began court-ordered negotiations with lawyers representing more than 100,000 U.S. military veterans earlier this month, discussing veterans' claims that the earplugs caused hearing damage.</p><p>3M said the earplugs are safe and effective, and that they work when soldiers are given proper training. 3M has said it is protected from such lawsuits, because the company was delivering products that the military requested.</p><p>Lawyers for 3M and the soldiers have completed 16 court-ordered bellwether trials, which are designed to inform potential settlement discussions. Plaintiffs won 10 of those trials; 3M won six. An additional eight cases were dismissed.</p><p>Potential legal liabilities from the earplugs lawsuits, and other litigation, have weighed on 3M shares, analysts said. The company's stock has declined about 35% over the past 12 months.</p><p>3M's expansion into the military earplugs business came via its acquisition of Indianapolis-based Aearo Technologies Inc., which in the 1990s developed a dual-sided earplug: One side reduced all noise, and the other side allowed spoken communication to be heard while still protecting the wearer from loud sounds such as explosions. 3M purchased Aearo for $1.2 billion in 2008.</p><p>Moldex-Metric Inc., a privately owned California company, in 2011 started selling its own military-grade earplug.</p><p>Both companies' earplugs have two modes, allowing different levels of sounds to be heard. With 3M's earplugs, wearers turn them around and insert the other side into the ear to allow more or less sound through, while Moldex's earplugs have a flippable cap.</p><p>Moldex's new product raised concerns among 3M employees, who were worried about a competitor pushing into the business, according to company emails. One 3M employee in 2011 said the combat earplugs had annual sales of more than $4 million and a profit margin of nearly 90%.</p><p>3M in 2012 filed a patent lawsuit against Moldex. It moved to withdraw the suit the following year. In 2014, Moldex sued 3M, alleging that 3M used the patent suit to try to dominate the military earplug market. 3M denied the allegations.</p><p>During the ensuing litigation, lawyers for Moldex obtained an Aearo testing memo that has become a central part of the veteran lawsuits. According to lawyers representing the veterans, the 2000 report showed that Aearo knew the earplugs had problems.</p><p>Moldex Chief Executive Mark Magidson declined to comment on the dispute.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
