  "text": "<p>Supply chain challenges led General Electric to miss Wall Street's expectations for the fourth quarter, in a setback for chief executive Larry Culp's plan to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ca38b2c-a9ce-4450-b156-a17a24e33976\">split the industrial conglomerate </a>into three companies.</p> <p>GE's revenue for the final three months of 2021 fell 3 per cent to $20.3bn, compared with a consensus forecast of $21.5bn from analysts polled by Refinitiv. </p> <p>Its shares dropped 6.8 per cent in morning trading on Tuesday, to levels last seen almost a year ago, before it announced a split designed to unlock value for investors. Culp plans to break up the conglomerate into three public companies focused on healthcare, energy and aviation.</p> <p>Culp said supply chain “headwinds”, including shortages of semiconductors, resin, parts and labour, had hit its healthcare business hardest and affected the group's sales by about 3 percentage points. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/01/results-semiconductor-supply-chain-request-information\">report </a>from the US commerce department on Tuesday found that US manufacturers' demand for semiconductors had surged 17 per cent between 2019 and 2021, but “a major supply and demand mismatch” had cut the median inventory of chips from 40 days to fewer than five days. </p> <p>Many of the largest US companies have been cautioning for months about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a7cdc0d-99aa-4ef6-ba9a-fd1a1180dc82\">challenges posed</a> by chip shortages, rising freight costs, backlogged ports and shortages of labour throughout the supply chain. </p> <p>Several have managed to navigate those headwinds better than others, however, with 3M on Tuesday saying that the diversified industrial group had “effectively managed supply chain disruptions”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>GE's healthcare orders remained strong, said Carolina Dybeck Happe, its chief financial officer, but the group forecast supply chain disruptions to last at least through the first six months of this year. </p> <p>The company had also lost revenues from being more selective about which projects it took on in power and renewable energy, Culp said, pointing to its 2020 decision to exit the new-build coal-fired generation market. He argued, however, that this more selective approach would improve margins and reduce risk over time.</p> <p>GE swung to a net loss of $3.9bn or $3.55 a share in the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $2.4bn or $2.20 a share a year earlier. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of 92 cents a share beat estimates of 85 cents a share. Its industrial cash flow — a figure closely watched on Wall Street — hit $3.8bn, also exceeding forecasts.</p> <p>Culp forecast a return to revenue growth in 2022, driven by a hoped-for jump in aviation revenue as air travel recovers. The group guided investors to expect organic revenues to increase by a high-single digit percentage, adjusted earnings of between $2.80 to $3.50 a share for the full year and free cash flow of $5.5bn-$6.5bn.</p> <p>“We're seeing real momentum and opportunities for sustainable profitable growth from near-term improvements in GE's businesses, especially as aviation recovers and our end markets strengthen,” Culp told investors, saying that a double-digit increase in orders in 2021 pointed to faster growth. </p> <p>An $87bn reduction in GE's debt load over the past three years had put it in a position to “play offence”, he added, saying that it was seeking organic investment opportunities and bolt-on acquisitions. </p><p>Source: Mamta Badkar and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York 2022 'GE revenue misses expectations as tangled supply chains take toll' FT.com 25 January.
