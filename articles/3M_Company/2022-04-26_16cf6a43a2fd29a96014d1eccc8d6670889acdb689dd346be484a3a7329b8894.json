  "text": "<p>A fierce debate about the future of Twitter has begun after Elon Musk pulled off a stunning victory to secure <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79e3bc48-96ef-4e62-b30b-d3ddb45d7a2f\">the support of the social media company's board</a> for a $44bn takeover.</p> <p>Among Democrats there was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fabd30a5-237c-46ab-8b59-fb3f9a03a225\">widespread alarm</a> about the prospect of former president Donald Trump rejoining the platform while Republicans were jubilant.</p> <p>Trump himself appeared to rule out a return to Twitter, telling Fox News yesterday that he would communicate via his own social media venture, Truth Social. Other Republicans, however, looked forward to their return to the platform. </p> <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial Republican member of Congress whose personal account was banned, said: “Prepare for blue check mark full scale meltdown after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk\">@elonmusk</a> seals the deal and I should get my personal Twitter account restored.”</p> <p>But Democrats said the platform's content moderation rules could be relaxed under Musk's ownership, leading to an explosion of hate speech and misinformation.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who has publicly clashed with Musk on the platform, tweeted: “This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable.”</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html\">statement</a> released to announce the deal, Musk said: “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”</p> <p>Musk, who will fund the $54.20 per share cash purchase from his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/427218b5-f6c7-4287-b493-2bd299081b1c\">vast personal wealth</a>, has said he is not interested in the economic benefits of owning Twitter. Experts have warned looser content moderation policies will scare off advertisers. </p> <p>Twitter yesterday raced to reassure advertising agencies in the wake of the deal announcement, telling them to expect business as usual and underlining its commitment to its existing product road map, according to screenshots of emails seen by the Financial Times. It will update investors on Thursday about the business when it releases earnings.</p> <p>Investors, however, appeared to be warming to the deal. The shares, which have traded below the offer price since it was unveiled on April 14, rose 5.6 per cent in pre-market trading to $51.70. </p> <p><em>Will Musk's ownership of Twitter make the platform better or worse?
