  "text": "<p>General Electric raised its forecast for cash flows and delivered better than expected second-quarter results, as America's best-known industrial conglomerate rode the upswing in the global economy.</p> <p>A recovery in its aviation and healthcare businesses — two of the group's major profit engines — helped GE generate $18.3bn of revenues in the second quarter, up 9 per cent from a year ago and ahead of forecasts.</p> <p>With major economies beginning to rebound from the damage inflicted by the pandemic, GE on Tuesday lifted its full-year forecast for industrial cash flow — a figure closely watched on Wall Street — to a range of $3.5bn to $5bn, up from $2.5bn to $4.5bn. </p> <p>Chief executive Larry Culp, whose $230m pay package was roundly&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/131f52af-53c5-47d8-b915-767df8403bb5\">rejected</a>&#xa0;by shareholders in May, said that “momentum is building across our businesses”.</p> <p>Evidence of a recovery at GE was echoed by 3M, the Minnesota-based industrial group which makes everything from N95 masks to Post-it notes. The company reported “organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas,” as is raised its earnings forecast for the full year. </p> <p>Chief executive Mike Roman told analysts that the company had seen “ongoing strength in many end markets including home improvement, oral care and general industrial along with a pick-up in healthcare elective procedures”.</p> <p>Although 3M rivals GE in market capitalisation, the latter, whose businesses stretch from energy to transport, has long been seen as a bellwether for the global economy. </p> <p>Its aviation business, which supplies engines and other components, was particularly hard hit last year as global lockdowns plunged the airline sector into its worst crisis in decades. Demand for its medical equipment, including ultrasound gear, waned as hospitals prioritised treating Covid -19 patients over more standard elective procedures. </p> <p>The second quarter showed signs of rebound in both businesses, with revenues at the aviation division climbing 10 per cent to $4.8bn from a year ago. Orders surged 47 per cent, a marked improvement from the first three months of 2021<strong>,</strong> when orders tumbled 26 per cent.</p> <p>Revenues in GE's healthcare business rose 14 per cent from a year ago to $4.45bn.</p> <p>GE shares were up 2 per cent on Tuesday, extending their advance this year to more than 20 per cent. </p> <p>The pandemic erupted as Culp, who has led the group since late 2018, sought to quell investors' fears that GE had become too sprawling and was burdened with too much debt. As part of his efforts, Culp agreed in March to sell its aircraft-leasing business to Irish company AerCap for $30bn.</p> <p>GE's adjusted earnings of $425m, or 5 cents a share, exceeded analysts' expectations of 3 cents. The group's industrial cash flow for the period, meanwhile, was $388m compared with cash burn of $845m in the first quarter of this year and $2.1bn in the second quarter of 2020.</p> <p>Culp added that “while we recognise that many are still facing continued challenges with new Covid spikes and variants, we're seeing our businesses return to growth this quarter”.</p> <p>Echoing companies across several sectors, GE also flagged the pressure of rising costs. Chief financial officer Carolina Happe said she expects inflationary pressures for the rest of this year and into 2022, particularly in aviation and renewables. However, GE is focused on reducing costs and using price increases to mitigate the effects, she added.</p><p>Source: Mamta Badkar in New York 2021 'GE signals global recovery as it lifts cash flow targets' FT.com 27 July.
