  "text": "<p>The agreement is part of the federal government's efforts to better coordinate the production and distribution of medical-grade face masks, which have become critical equipment for people treating Covid-19 patients. The effort includes big manufacturers, such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc., both of which have ramped up production of N95s and other protective gear in the past year. Masks and other gear remain in short supply as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations hover near peak levels across much of the country.</p><p>The project is operating under a provision of the Defense Production Act that allows the federal government to consult with businesses for emergency preparedness and response. President Trump invoked that part of the law by executive order in March.</p><p>The agreement provides participants with protection from potential antitrust lawsuits for cooperating as part of the agreement, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are overseeing the meetings to ensure that the cooperation and data-sharing steers as clear as possible of anticompetitive practices, the group's agreement states. Companies aren't typically allowed to hold such detailed discussions about production plans with competitors.</p><p>Mask makers in the group, including 3M, Honeywell and Owens &amp; Minor Inc., together account for much of the U.S. capacity to make N95 masks. Other participants include distributors W.W. Grainger Inc. and Henry Schein Inc., group-purchasing organizations Premier Inc. and Vizient Inc., and medical device manufacturers including General Electric Co. and Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc.</p><p>Participants said bringing manufacturers, distributors, buyers and government officials together will help speed up distribution and overcome bottlenecks. \"It serves the nation's response to have a line-of-sight,\" said Omar Vargas, 3M's head of government relations.</p><p>Some participants said they plan to discuss standardizing product identification numbers so that mask shortages can be more easily spotted. Manufacturers said the program could also help them track where masks go after they are sold to medical distributors.</p><p>Leaders from some companies said officials took too long to bring the group together. \"It's been very bureaucratic in the approach of setting it up,\" said Blair Childs, an executive in public affairs for Premier. \"The biggest challenge we have seen in the supply chain is lack of coordination.\"</p><p>Federal officials said that outside the work of the new group, they have signed contracts totaling hundreds of millions of dollars with mask makers in the group to boost production. FEMA said it also has worked separately with companies to import tens of millions of masks from China and to coordinate where masks are distributed in the U.S. Companies meeting with FEMA said the new effort, and the legal protections it affords, will help them better coordinate their work as the pandemic stretches toward the one-year mark.</p><p>\"The government cannot get us out of the pandemic alone,\" said Nicolette Louissaint, president of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit focused on medical supply chain preparedness that is part of the agreement.</p>",
