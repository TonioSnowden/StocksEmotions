  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Arts in Review -- Art Review:  A Thaw in  The Frieze  ---  Celebrating the first major art fair in the U.S.  since the Covid-19 pandemic started  ----  By Brian P. Kelly",
  "text": "<p>    New York -- The art fair has awoken after a year-long slumber, refreshed and full of nervous energy -- while at the same time undeniably transformed. Frieze (through May 9) -- the first major fair to open in the U.S. since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic -- may not be a phoenix rising from lockdown ashes, Nonetheless, it remains a metamorphosed creature, recognizable in its genetic structure and immutable characteristics, but fundamentally altered, and in many ways for the better. </p><p>   Previously held on Randall's Island, Frieze, known for its brand-name exhibitors and affection for the controversial and the contemporary, has moved to the Shed -- the ultra-flexible, high-tech cultural center at Hudson Yards. And while the new venue may be the most obvious shift, the dozens of other changes resulting from a global health crisis are just as notable, not for their monumentality but because of their lack of it, all serving as signposts of what a return to normal might look like for art lovers and the fair circuit. </p><p>   As the Journal reported earlier this week, in-person exhibitors, spread across three floors, now number 60 compared with the roughly 160 in the past. (Frieze offers an online viewing room -- that stopgap that fairgoers acclimated to over the past year -- with about that number of galleries.) And instead of the come-and-go, browse-as-you-please tenor of previous fairs, this year's features timed ticketing, a two-hour viewing limit, and proof of vaccination or negative test for entry. And once inside, the fair is almost paperless with maps, checklists and more provided via QR codes throughout the venue. </p><p>   So how does this new fair fare? Let's get the negative out of the way first. I terribly miss the Randall's Island experience. The ferry ride. The landscape. Picnicking outside the Frieze tent. All these marked a spring Hajj to witness the metaphorical rebirth of the natural and New York art worlds. This year, the rebirth may be more meaningful than in the past, but the chill of Hudson Yards is a far cry from the vivacious exuberance of Frieze's earlier setting. If ever there was a year when that feeling was needed, it was this one. </p><p>   However, once inside, there is plenty to like about this new Frieze. The decreased number of exhibitors makes the fair itself feel breezy, and splitting them across three floors gives you the opportunity to breath between venues, to reflect on what you've just taken in. The fair feels manageable while, in the past, other fairs, including Frieze itself, have felt overwhelming. That sense extends to the timed, limited entry. Fewer visitors is not an ideal situation if you're trying to sell art, but if you're trying to look at it, it's fantastic. (In the past, attendance has numbered around 50,000; now total capacity at a given time is capped at about 850, including fair and gallery staff.) There's no jostling, shoulder-to-shoulder, to get a glimpse at the most popular booths, and between the spaced out visitors and the strict restrictions, things on my visit felt about as safe as a major art fair could be. The mood itself was one of apprehensive joy, the feeling of being reunited with school friends after a too-long summer break -- there were handshakes and gasp hugs, and behind masks, many smiles. </p><p>   But what about the art? Seeing old friends is nice, but that's not why one comes to a fair. By their very nature, events like this, that gather galleries and work from around the world, don't have a single narrative. But much of the best work here seems to be imbued with a cautious optimism -- the joy of surviving the past year's collective trauma flecked with terror at the thought of backsliding. Frieze has been changed by Covid-19, but artists and viewers have, too. Which is why Kaari Upson's \"Self Same Pattern\" (2021), a series of 10 crushed urethane cauldrons on a light-as-air pink table -- a wink to Eva Hesse? -- collides the delicate and the sturdy, a wistful hope that supports ruin of the past. But it also brings to mind the frustration of cooking meal after meal during quarantine, the rage at seeing a dish-filled sink for the hundredth time. The pairing of Huma Bhabha's roughly sculpted, alienlike bronzes with Daniel Hesidence's breathable, pastel-hued canvases underlines the happy/fearful nature of the affair, as do Yuji Agematsu's miniature sculptures, all made from trash, which in their abstractions take on forms ranging from the creepily buglike to the calmingly arboreal. </p><p>   Other must-see works include Cynthia Daignault's \"26 Seconds\" (2021), a series of nine paintings of frames from the Zapruder film that make us reflect on personal recording devices' role in history, from JFK to George Floyd; Katherine Bernhardt's nostalgia-drowned paintings of ET and the Pink Panther; Jan Gatewood's \"3M Mantra Magnified and Seeking Connection\" and Emma Stern's \"Nina (Roller Girl)\" (both 2021), eyecatcching pieces that at first look like CGI but on closer inspection are made with traditional materials, gentle sendups of the current NFT craze; Hugo McCloud's \"Rush Hour\" (2021), a panel depicting daily life in Mexico made entirely from single-use plastics; and Dana Schutz's chaotic canvases populated by creations that look like they could have come from the mind of Hieronymus Bosch after visiting a carnival on acid. </p><p>   The harsh reality of the past year is also why the levity in some works seems doubly worthy of celebration -- after 2020, we all deserve some happiness, and Hernan Bas delivers it by the gallon in \"The Suspect,\" a six-panel folding screen with a series of paintings of fishless fishtanks, a disgruntled looking aquarist, and an octopus, tentacles on top of a tank, who might know a thing or two about what happened to all those swimmers. </p><p>   While there's still so much uncertainty about the future, for a moment at Frieze, we can all feel like that octopod: happy, safe and sated. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Kelly is the Associate Editor of the Journal's Arts in Review page. </p><p></p>",
