  "text": "<p>The major indexes are holding onto their July gains, but persistent inflation and signs of a slowing economy are giving investors no leave to relax. This week, the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, also brings a Fed policy meeting at which U.S. central bankers are expected on Wednesday to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point in their effort to tame rising prices.</p><p>As higher borrowing costs begin to cool economic output, investors are focused on how well household finances and corporate profits are holding up.</p><p>\"We've been so spoiled over the last couple years by how every single earnings report was meeting or exceeding expectations,\" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at MissionSquare Retirement. \"Certainly as we've gotten into 2022, that has not been the case.\"</p><p>Shares of Walmart fell 8% after the country's largest retailer warned that higher prices for food and fuel were causing consumers to pull back. Target shares were dragged down too, dropping 3.7%. General Motors shares gave up 2.8% after the car maker's second-quarter profit fell short of estimates.</p><p>Other earnings report revealed bright spots. General Electric shares added 5.6% after the company reported better-than-expected results. Consumer-product manufacturer 3M jumped 6% after it said it would spin off its healthcare business to create two public companies.</p><p>A bevy of other leading companies including Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Alphabet, Visa, Mondelez Internationaland Chipotle Mexican Grillwill post results after the closing bell.</p><p>Each stands to offer clues about how well different corners of industry are withstanding inflation, rising interest rates and many consumers' souring view of the economy. Some investors are worried that the fast tightening of financial conditions will compound economic pressure brought on by Covid-19, supply-chain disruptions and the Ukraine war to tip the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>\"You could see a long period of slower growth,\" said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"There's a lot of what's going on right now that can't be modeled.\"</p><p>Anxiety continued to spill into the bond market, where trading pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.790% from 2.819% Monday. The benchmark government bond has rallied over the past month as investors seek a safe harbor and revise down their bets on how high the Fed will raise interest rates before changing course. Bond yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>Debt investors are trying to forecast how the central bank will balance its twin jobs: getting inflation under control while avoiding a deep contraction that could damage the still-strong labor market. Falling yields indicate that many traders foresee the Fed pivoting to easier money to cushion a slowing economy. But they may be underestimating just how stubborn inflation has become, said Thanos Bardas, global co-head of investment-grade debt at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>\"I'm very skeptical the Fed will be able to cut rates as soon as the market believes,\" Mr. Bardas said.</p><p>Meanwhile, overseas markets are facing headwinds of their own.</p><p>European natural-gas prices rose on concerns that Russia's cut to the Nord Stream pipeline could mean a shortage in Europe come winter. European countries on Tuesday reached a watered-down agreement to curb their consumption of natural gas over the next eight months in an effort to shield their economies from a possible cutoff of Russian supplies.</p><p>Mr. Wicker of MissionSquare said that his firm has limited its international stock holdings this year, in part because of how war in Ukraine is rocking European economies.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 closed roughly flat. UBS Group shares slid 9.4% after the bank reported a small increase in second-quarter earnings, but the results missed analysts' expectations.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed mostly higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.7%. Alibaba Group Holding will pursue a primary listing of its stock in Hong Kong, hedging its bets as regulatory pressure on Chinese companies grows on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 0.5% to $99.67 a barrel.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Fall With Major Earnings on Tap, Fed Looming</p>",
