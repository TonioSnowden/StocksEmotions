  "title": "3M to Stop Making, Discontinue Use of 'Forever Chemicals'; Company says it has already reduced its use of PFAS, which accumulate and take a long time to break down",
  "text": "<p>In recent decades, research has linked exposure to some forms of the chemicals with health problems including kidney and testicular cancers, thyroid disease and high cholesterol, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Regulators and environmental groups have taken aim at the chemicals, and thousands of lawsuitsalleging contamination and illness have been filed in recent years targeting 3M and other manufacturers.</p><p>3M estimated that its current annual sales of manufactured PFAS total about $1.3 billion. The company said it would stop making all fluoropolymers, fluorinated fluids and PFAS-based additive products by the end of 2025.</p><p>The company also said it would stop using PFAS across its products by the end of 2025, saying that it has already reduced its use of the substances over the past three years.</p><p>3M cited accelerating regulatory focus on eliminating the chemicals and \"changing stakeholder expectations\" in making its decision.</p><p>\"While PFAS can be safely made and used, we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve,\" 3M Chief Executive Mike Roman said.</p><p>3M's shares have fallen about 31% so far this year, compared with a 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>Over the course of exiting the business of manufacturing the chemicals, 3M said it expects to incur pretax charges of about $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion, including a $700 million to $1 billion charge in the current quarter. The St. Paul, Minn.-based manufacturer said it intends to fulfill current contractual obligations during the transition period.</p><p>The EPA in August proposed designating two forms of PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the federal Superfund law. The American Chemistry Council and companies such as 3M opposed the move, saying that it wasn't based on the best available science and that it wouldn't speed up remediation of contaminated sites.</p><p>3M phased out production of those two PFAS chemicals, known as PFOA and PFOS, in the early 2000s.</p><p>The two forms of PFAS chemicals have been at the center of thousands of lawsuits targeting 3M and other manufacturers. More than 200 public water systems, 13 states and cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore and San Diego have sued 3M and other companies that sold firefighting foam containing the chemicals, alleging that they contaminated drinking water. Firefighters have also sued, alleging that repeated exposure to PFAS in firefighting foam caused cancer and other illnesses.</p><p>The lawsuits claim manufacturers knew that PFAS were harmful and accumulating in people and the environment, but didn't alert the EPA for years. While drinking water filtration systems can remove the chemicals, the process can be costly, according to lawyers targeting the manufacturers.</p><p>3M has said that firefighting foam helped save servicemember and civilian lives, and that the company produced the foam to the military's specifications, qualifying 3M for legal protection from liability as a government contractor.</p><p>3M has other legal challenges related to its products. U.S. military veterans have filed lawsuits against 3M over hearing damage linked to what they claim are defects in the company's military-grade earplugs. The company facesbillions of dollars in potential costs from legal settlements or trials after soldiers alleged they returned from war with hearing damage due to the earplugs, which the government bought for around $7.63 a pair.</p><p>3M has said the earplugs are safe and effective when soldiers are given the proper training on how to use them.</p><p>3M, which also makes products including Scotch tape and Post-it Notes, is proceeding with plans to spin off its healthcare business as a public company. In the fall, 3M cut its profit and sales forecast for the year, amid weakening demand from customers and as inflation weighed on consumer spending.</p><p>Bob Tita contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>3M to Stop Making, Discontinue Use of 'Forever Chemicals'</p>",
