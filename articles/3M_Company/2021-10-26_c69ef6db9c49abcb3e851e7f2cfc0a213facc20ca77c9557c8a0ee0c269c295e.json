  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA edged up 15.73 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at a record 35,756.88, after rising to an all-time intraday high of 35,892.92 in earlier activity.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 8.31 points, or 0.2%, to finish at a new peak of 4,574.79, after hitting an intraday record, at 4,598.53.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 9.01 points, or 0.1%, to end at 15,235.71. The tech-heavy index traded as high as 15,384, briefly topping its closing record of 15,374.33 from Sept. 7.</p><p>On Monday, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 ended at record highs, with the Nasdaq Composite closing within 1% away from a new high.</p><p>See:&#xa0;MarketWatch and Barron's are gathering the most influential figures in crypto to help identify the opportunities and risks that lie ahead in digital assets on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.&#xa0;Register today.</p><p>What drove the market?</p><p>Investors pushed stock benchmarks higher Tuesday as they continued to digest company earnings reports for the third quarter.</p><p>“Investors are shrugging off concerns about inflation. Instead, they are focusing on the corporate earnings season, which continues to surprise on both side of the Atlantic,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a note.</p><p>See: Why it's wrong to compare today's inflation surge to 1970s-style ‘stagflation'</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index has advanced for nine of the last 10 sessions as third-quarter earnings reports have largely topped expectations.</p><p>“Companies are still able to put through a lot of their prices increases,” said Paul Nolte, a senior portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, in a phone interview Tuesday. “So far, it seems the consumer is taking higher prices in stride.”</p><p>Tuesday's earnings wave included General Electric Co.GE, 3M Co. MMM, and, after the market close, Google parent Alphabet Inc.GOOGL and Microsoft Corp.MSFT. Social-media giant Facebook Inc.FB fell 3.9% after it surpassed third-quarter earnings estimates but issued a revenue outlook below Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>In economic data released Tuesday, the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices increased nationally 19.8% from a year ago in August, roughly in line with the previous month's increase. The separate 20-city index, which measures price appreciation among a group of major metropolitan areas across the country, showed a 19.7% year-over-year gain, down from a revised 20% annual gain the month before.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. new-home sales increased 14% to an annual rate of 800,000 in September, the government said Tuesday. The median forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch had been for new home sales to come in at an annual rate of 760,000 for September.</p><p>“The housing market is strong,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein, in a phone interview Tuesday. “Interest rates are very low,” he said, while “housing demand is very high.”</p><p>The Conference Board said its U.S. consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from a revised 109.8 a month earlier.&#xa0;The gain follows three straight declines in sentiment. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a decline to 108.</p><p>“It was encouraging, certainly, to see consumer confidence tick up,” said Winograd. “Consumer confidence has tracked the COVID situation pretty closely, and with the delta variant fading, it's good to see consumers responding.”</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of General Electric GE closed 2% higher after the industrial conglomerate reported third-quarter profit and industrial free cash flow that beat expectations, while providing an upbeat full-year earnings outlook.</p><p>3M Co. MMM shares slipped 0.1% after the maker of Post-it Notes and diversified industrial company topped forecasts for the third quarter.</p><p>Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp.LMT dropped 11.8% after the defense contractor's profit and sales fell and sales came in below consensus estimates.</p><p>Raytheon Technologies Corp.RTX reported earnings and revenue that topped forecasts while raising its 2021 outlook.

Yields and debt prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1%.</p><p>Oil futures ended higher, with the U.S. benchmark CL00 rising 1.1% to settle at $84.65 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 settled 0.7% lower at $1,793.40 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 index XX:SXXP ended 0.7% higher, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX gained 0.8%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP was down 0.3%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI fell 0.4% and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK jumped 1.8%.</p><p>—Steve Goldstein contributed to this report.</p>",
