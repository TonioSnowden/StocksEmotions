  "title": "Trading-Software Company Adara Files for Chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>Adara, which last year changed its name from Imation Enterprises Corp., is owned by GlassBridge Enterprises Inc., which has its roots in a 1996 data-storage spinoff by 3M Co. By 2015, Adara had net operating losses exceeding $450 million. It decided to exit the data-storage business and enter the asset-management business.</p><p>Last year, the coronavirus pandemic and resulting liquidity squeeze prompted an Adara bondholder and investor to scrap its plans to acquire all of Adara from GlassBridge, Adara President Daniel Strauss said in a court filing.</p><p>ESW subsequently provided a secured credit facility to Adara that enabled it to pay off the bondholder, he said.</p><p>Adara then tried to raise outside capital to repay the ESW loan, but was unable to find an investor before the debt matured this past January, causing a default and eventually the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Strauss said.</p><p>Austin, Texas-based ESW, including related entity ESW Holdings Inc., is now a secured lender owed $12.8 million, as well as a preferred shareholder.</p><p>A proposed restructuring agreement, subject to court approval and potentially higher bids, also includes $350,000 in financing from ESW that will help Adara get through bankruptcy.</p><p>Adara said it has minimal, if any, general unsecured claims. The company, which has four employees, hopes to get its bankruptcy plan approved in June.</p><p>ESW, short for \"Enterprise Software,\" is controlled by Texas billionaire Joseph Liemandt. Over the past couple of decades, the firm has bought more than 100 companies in deal sizes ranging from less than a million dollars to at least $460 million. Last year, ESW said it was aiming for more acquisitions in 2021 as the big companies that are its target customers rely ever more heavily on technology.</p><p>ESW's hunting grounds include smaller, ailing software businesses destined for bankruptcy court. Since 2015, ESW has sealed deals for about 10 bankrupt companies.</p><p>Adara is represented in the bankruptcy by law firms Gellert Scali Busenkell &amp; Brown LLC and Loeb &amp; Loeb LLP.</p>",
