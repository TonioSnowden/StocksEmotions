  "text": "<p>GE has made strides in restoring its credibility. The industrial conglomerate has long been a byword for opaque accounting and a sprawling mess of businesses. Under chief executive Larry Culp, the group has shed assets, pared down debt and begun simplifying its financial reporting.</p> <p>These efforts mean analysts can ditch the aspirins when going through GE's quarterly earnings. Investors — who now have a clearer view of the company's comeback efforts — have rewarded the company. The market capitalisation has risen 83 per cent to $118bn over the past 12 months. The stock, at 37 times forward earnings, now commands one of the richest valuations in the industrial sector. Another conglomerate, 3M, trades on half that multiple.</p> <p>Yet since March, GE shares have stuck at $100-$105 a share. That is understandable. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on demand for the group's products and services. Further share price gains require something outside Culp's control: a full recovery in the aviation industry and an end to the global supply chain turmoil.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_webcast_pressrelease_10262021.pdf\">Third-quarter results</a> underscored the scale of the challenges. Aviation and healthcare are the group's two main profit motors. The commercial jet engines business is recovering thanks to the rebound in global travel. But the healthcare unit, which makes CAT scanners, MRI machines and other hospital equipment, struggles because of supply shortages. GE's move to narrow its forecast for industrial free cash flow for 2021 other than to $3.75bn to $4.75bn reflects this uncertainty.</p> <p>GE Capital is another wild card. Once a systemically-important financial institution, Jeff Immelt shrunk it during his tenure as CEO. Culp took a big step toward unwinding the business further by merging its jet-leasing business with rival AerCap Holdings. GE Capital still has run-off long-term care insurance obligations, resulting in a $15bn reserve shortfall a couple of years back. </p> <p>Further bad news from this source — or anywhere else — would be harder to hide because of the simplified structure. But transparency also creates more value long term than it destroys. The final of shape of GE may be slimmer still.</p><p>Source:  2021 'GE: the untangling of an industrial behemoth' FT.com 26 October.
