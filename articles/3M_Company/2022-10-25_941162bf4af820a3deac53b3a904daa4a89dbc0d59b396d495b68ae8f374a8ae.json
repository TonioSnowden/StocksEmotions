  "text": "<p>Data released Tuesday morning showed home-price growth slowed sharply, sending bond yields tumbling.</p><p>The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.083% from 4.231% on Monday as bond prices rose, according to Tradeweb. Monday's yield was its highest closing level since 2008. The two-year yield, which is closely tied to central bank policy expectations, dropped to 4.409% from 4.498%.</p><p>Having fallen for months on fears about rising interest rates and soaring inflation, stocks have shot higher in recent days as investors cheered earnings from large financial firms.</p><p>Higher mortgage rates are crimping housing demand, denting red-hot home price inflation that has buoyed headline inflation measures. Stocks turned higher following the data release because some investors saw the drop in demand as a sign that the Fed's monetary tightening is reining in inflation.</p><p>Hopes—and bets—are building that the Federal Reserve could be approaching a point at which it feels comfortable easing the pace of its interest rate increases.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point next week, but are also expected to debate a smaller increase toward the end of the year, offering investors hope that the worst could be behind them.</p><p>\"It would be prudent here for policy makers to step on the brake a little bit. It would be prudent to signal that they aren't going to let financial conditions get too tight,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>The megacap technology firms set to report earnings could offer a barometer of the U.S. consumer.</p><p>Higher interest rates that proved to be a boon for bank earnings could have the opposite effect on interest rate-sensitive tech firms.</p><p>\"As the Federal Reserve continues to tighten, with a further 75-basis-point rate rise expected from next week's policy meeting, the tech sector looks especially vulnerable,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Spotify are set to report results after markets close, setting the tone for a week of tech earnings with Apple, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Amazon.com due to report later in the week.</p><p>Shares of General Electric slipped 1.8% as it outlined plans to cut costs. General Motors rose 2.9% after reporting earnings that were ahead of forecasts. 3M shares fell 0.9% after the sticky-note maker reported lower profits. United Parcel Service rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that beat forecasts.</p><p>U.S. listed Chinese stocks indexes are recovering some of Monday's record losses after President Xi Jinping's political-shakeup to kick off his third term. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 4.5% in Tuesday trading following a 14% drop on Monday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 1.2% to $92.32 a barrel.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 was an outperformer in Asia, rising 1%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.9%.</p><p>HSBC fell 6.2% in London after reporting a drop in quarterly profit and issuing a cautious outlook.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise Amid Earnings Stampede, Hopes for Easier Fed Policy</p>",
