  "title": "Chinese Owner Boosts  GE's Appliance Unit  ----  By Austen Hufford",
  "text": "<p>   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- When General Electric Co. agreed to sell its appliance unit to a Chinese manufacturer in 2016, the future wasn't clear for the business, its workers or the tens of millions of U.S. households owning GE appliances. </p><p>   Nearly six years later, GE Appliances is growing, having increased its U.S. market share every year since 2017. Since being bought by Qingdao, China-based Haier Group, GE Appliances has invested about $1.5 billion in technology and new products, and added about 3,000 jobs for a total U.S. workforce of 15,000. In October, the company announced an additional $450 million investment and 1,000 new jobs at its main Appliance Park campus in Louisville that makes washers, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators. </p><p>   The appliance maker's path after operating within GE's conglomerate structure is drawing new attention as GE prepares to separate its remaining businesses into three companies, focused on aviation, healthcare and power. GE executives say that separation will let managers better focus on their individual business lines, benefit customers and attract more investors. </p><p>    Kevin Nolan, GE Appliances' chief executive, said the move out from under GE to appliance maker Haier has improved his company's culture and decision making. </p><p>   It held 16.4% of the retail market for large appliances in the 12 months through September, its highest percentage in at least a decade, according to research firm TraQline. </p><p>   \"If you got a big, bureaucratic organization, there is no way you can move at the speed of the market,\" Mr. Nolan said. \"You see a real winning spirit with the employees now.\" </p><p>   GE Appliances' 2016 sale to Haier for $5.4 billion was years in the making. In 2008 GE said it intended to sell or spin off the appliance unit. </p><p>   But the plan was shelved as that year's financial crisis crashed the housing market, said Chip Blankenship, who started running GE Appliances in 2012 and left in 2017, about a year after the acquisition. </p><p>   Mr. Blankenship said during his tenure he was charged with shepherding parts of a $1 billion investment from GE -- spread out over several years -- that included moving some production back to the U.S. </p><p>   Mr. Blankenship said he didn't anticipate getting another investment of that size for another decade. </p><p>   \"We would always be No. 12 on a list of nine things that could be funded\" at GE, he said. </p><p>   A GE spokeswoman pointed to announcements made at the time of the sale, saying it was part of an effort to make GE a simpler and more-focused industrial company, and that Haier was committed to investing in the business. </p><p>   Some analysts say there are benefits to being a company with multiple distinct markets because the various business cycles might not overlap, allowing a growing part to buoy the broader company while another is declining. </p><p>    3M Co., for example, saw growth in its medical-grade face masks in 2020, which partially offset declines in other parts of its business. </p><p>   The acquisition of a well-known U.S. brand by the Chinese company came against a backdrop of growing tensions between the two nations in such issues as trade, technology and human rights. </p><p>   Some Western organizations have faced backlashes and boycotts in China, while the U.S. government has barred domestic companies from investing in or exporting to certain Chinese companies. </p><p>   GE Appliances executives said being part of a Chinese corporation hasn't hurt the brand. \"I can't sit there or worry about impressions or political things that are going on,\" Mr. Nolan said. </p><p></p>",
