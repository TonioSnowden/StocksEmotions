Soaring inflation is weighing on companies and consumers, while the Federal Reserve's indications that it will quickly tighten monetary policy threatens to drag on growth.</p><p>\"We're in a world-wide tightening cycle now, and so we have to let the air out of many of these assets,\" said Mace McCain, chief investment officer at Frost Investment Advisors.</p><p>Assets considered havens in times of trouble, such as Treasury bonds, are being pressured by inflation and expectations for tighter central-bank policy along with stocks, complicating matters for investors seeking shelter during recent volatility.
