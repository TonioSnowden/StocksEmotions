  "text": "<p>Andy Reynolds Smith has stepped down as the chief executive of Smiths Group as the UK industrial conglomerate aims to expand once it has spun off its medical business.</p> <p>Paul Keel, who has worked in senior roles at US multinational 3M for 16 years, has taken over with immediate effect at the helm of the engineering group that was crucial to the UK's efforts to produce its own ventilators during the peak of the first wave of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The unexpected move was “mutually agreed” between the board and Reynolds Smith, who had been in charge of the company since 2015 and will remain at the group until the end of its fiscal year in July.</p> <p>Industrial groups globally have come under investor pressure to streamline or simplify their portfolios. Smiths, which makes products ranging from oil pipeline seals to airport scanners, was no exception, deciding in 2019 to spin off its medical business. </p> <p>The split was delayed because of the pandemic, but the board said it “remains committed to the separation of Smiths Medical”, which the company previously had said it aimed to complete by the end of July.</p> <p>Smiths hopes to grow as swaths of the economy put a greater focus on security, safety and hygiene. It also aims to snap up opportunities to provide engineering to next-generation technologies such as low Earth orbit satellites and clean energy. </p> <p>Keel's “international experience positions him well to build on the progress made during Andy's tenure and allows Smiths to deliver on its significant potential as it enters its next growth phase”, said Sir George Buckley, chair of Smiths and a former 3M chief executive.</p> <p>Keel will receive an annual salary of £875,000 with bonuses up to 180 per cent of that figure and shares subject to performance, the company said. The appointment was made after “an extensive search process”. </p> <p>Reynolds Smith will be paid under his notice period by Smiths until May 24 2022 unless he finds a new position before then.</p> <p>Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Investec, said Reynolds Smith did a “reasonable job” in rationalising the company into four divisions, but was unable to drive growth as much as investors would have liked.</p> <p>“Visualise a guy on the stage spinning plates. By the time you've spun the last one, the first one has stopped spinning,” he said, referring to the longstanding challenge faced by Smiths. </p> <p>He added: “Smiths should be able to grow above GDP or global industrial production, but they have to make sure all the divisions align to get that growth.”</p> <p>The company's share price held steady at £15.51 by mid-morning on Tuesday. </p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey 2021 'Smiths Group chief stands down with immediate effect' FT.com 25 May.
