  "text": "<p>Shares in Avon Protection plummeted on Friday after the UK defence supplier said it had launched a strategic review of its body armour business following the failure of one of its products in tests for the US military. </p> <p>The Wiltshire-based supplier of military equipment, until recently known as Avon Rubber, warned of separate delays in obtaining approval for another product as the company's shares tumbled.</p> <p>They dropped by as much as 44 per cent in early morning trade — the biggest drop on record since 1989. By lunchtime they had recovered slightly to £10.71, down 43 per cent.</p> <p>The group added that the financial contribution of its armour business next year and beyond “will be significantly reduced”. The company also delayed its 2021 results previously due on November 23. </p> <p>The company, which used to make everything from <a href=\"https://www.avon-protection-plc.com/who-we-are/history/#currentPage=1\">pneumatic tyres to milking machine tubes</a>, had until recently been regarded as one of the more successful corporate transformation stories on the London market. </p> <p>Under chief executive Paul McDonald it has turned itself into a critical supplier to the US military, as well as the emergency services. </p> <p>It bought US conglomerate 3M's helmet and armour business in 2019 and Ohio-based headgear purveyor Team Wendy last year. It also sold its dairy arm. </p> <p>Investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c70f670-f52b-40e8-bf73-5fc81fd55f1f\">bought into the story</a>, sending its shares as high as £46 last autumn. A disappointing trading update in December triggered a sustained sell-off. The company in August warned that bottlenecks in its supply chain would dent profits this year and next. </p> <p>However, McDonald only last month gave an <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/avon_rubber_plc1/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=820&amp;newsid=1516777\">upbeat assessment</a>, telling investors in a trading update that the company was carrying “significant commercial momentum into FY22, which will also benefit from a strong ramp-up in body armour”.&#xa0;</p> <p>A person close to the company said that it was notified of the failure in testing on Wednesday night and had made the announcement “as soon as was practicable”.</p> <p>Nevertheless, analysts noted that management's credibility had been hit. </p> <p>“We are clearly disappointed by this news . . . The company is taking decisive action, although we do wonder if this was required over 12 months ago,” said analysts at Stifel.</p> <p>Avon's body armour business accounts for about 15 per cent of overall group revenue. The company stressed that the issues and the strategic review were restricted to its body armour business and that its higher margin respiratory protection and helmet product portfolios remained unaffected. </p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer in London 2021 'UK's Avon Protection takes hit after body armour product fails US test' FT.com 12 November.
