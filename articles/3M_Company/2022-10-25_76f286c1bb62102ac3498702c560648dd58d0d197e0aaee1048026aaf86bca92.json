  "text": "<p>The company posted a profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 of $3.86 billion, or $6.77 a share, compared with $1.43 billion, or $2.45 a share, a year earlier. During the quarter, 3M completed the deal to merge its food-safety business with Neogen Corp.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items including a $4.71-per-share gain from divestitures, adjusted earnings came to $2.69 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for adjusted earnings of $2.60 a share.</p><p>Sales fell 4% to $8.62 billion for the third quarter, missing Wall Street expectations for revenue of $8.71 billion, according to FactSet. The company said foreign-currency translations due to the run-up in the U.S. dollar reduced revenue growth by 5%.</p><p>Shares of 3M fell more than 2% in premarket trading to $115.50. So far this year, the stock is down more than 33%.</p><p>3M also cut its full-year sales and adjusted earnings guidance, saying it now expects sales to come in 3.5% to 3% below 2021 sales, reduced from prior guidance of a decline of between 2.5% and 0.5%. Adjusted earnings are expected to be between $10.10 a share and $10.35 a share, down from the prior range of $10.30 a share to $10.80 a share.</p><p>The company said foreign-currency translations will take a larger toll than previously expected, reducing sales by an estimated 4.5% for the year, compared with the prior expectation of a 4% hit to sales.</p><p>The results come as 3M works to spin off its healthcare business into a separate, public company. The conglomerate is also trying to shield itself from a mountain of personal-injury lawsuits filed over its allegedly defective military earplugs, which were produced by its subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC. Aearo has sought bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>3M's Quarterly Sales Fall Due to Strong Dollar</p>",
