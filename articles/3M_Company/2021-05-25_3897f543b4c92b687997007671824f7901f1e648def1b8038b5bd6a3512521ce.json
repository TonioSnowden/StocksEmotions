  "text": "<p>Amigo is in crisis after the High Court rejected its controversial creditors' scheme of arrangement that could cap its liabilities. The guarantor lender said its board was reviewing all options including an appeal. </p> <p>“Amigo is incredibly disappointed that the Scheme has not been approved,” said Gary Jennison, chief executive officer. “We are currently reviewing all our options and will provide an update at the earliest opportunity.”</p> <p>The scheme, designed to caps awards for the mis-selling of guaranteed loans by Amigo, had won the support of 74,877 customers representing over 95 per cent of those who voted. The Financial Conduct Authority argued that Amigo could offer “a better, fairer deal” for&#xa0;customers due redress.</p> <p>“The FCA considered it necessary in this case to share with the court its view that the scheme as proposed was inherently unfair, as it placed a disproportionate burden on customers, as opposed to shareholders and bondholders, to keep the company afloat,” the FCA said. “This is an important judgment and any firm considering a scheme of arrangement should take it into consideration.”</p> <p>The troubles of companies like Amigo and sector peer Provident Financial rarely inspire much sympathy. But rising financial vulnerability means <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72b3e83a-4e6e-479d-b5df-e5c572e7d477\">alternatives to high street lenders</a> are needed, writes <strong>Helen Thomas</strong> in today's FT.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Telit Communications</strong> has agreed to be taken private by Dbay, the activist private equity group that is its biggest shareholder, at a value of £306.9m. The internet of things equipment maker said it had accepted a cash offer of 220p from Dbay, a 6 per cent premium to its price when the offer period began in March. Shareholders not wanting cash are to be offered an alternative of a loan note. Telit's board — which includes the Chinese businessman who controls Run Liang Tai Management, the group's second-largest shareholder — had faced criticism in March for allowing Dbay to begin due diligence without committing to a price. </p> <p>Furniture and homewares retailer <strong>Made</strong> set out plans to float on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange. The company said it intends to raise approximately £100m.</p> <p><strong>Hurricane Energy</strong> posted a $625.3m annual loss and said it will not be in a position to repay $230m of convertible bond debt falling due in July 2022. “Material uncertainties regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern have been identified, pending the results of the proposed financial restructuring process” announced in April, the oil explorer said. </p> <p>Software maker <strong>Aveva</strong> posted an adjusted pre-tax profit for the year ended March of £338.7m, up 12.3 per cent year on year, following its $5bn purchase of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a85ae32c-bf0e-4d8f-9983-3a287c6189c7\">US peer OSIsoft</a> in August. “Although early in the financial year, trading has started well for the enlarged Aveva group and it is performing in-line with our expectations,” said chief executive Peter Herweck.</p> <p><strong>Avon Rubber</strong> plans to change its name to Avon Protection later this year. The maker of respiratory&#xa0;masks for military and emergency services posted an adjusted pre-tax profit of $16m in the half year ended March, up 23.1 per cent year on year, with revenue growing 41 per cent to $122m. Trading since March has continued in line with expectations with “excellent” revenue visibility going into 2022 and beyond, it said.</p> <p><strong>Ted Baker</strong>, which on Monday delayed the announcement of full-year results, said it agreed an extension to its revolving credit facility with its existing lending syndicate.&#xa0;The fashion label said it had agreed with lenders to cut the size of its loan and extend the maturity by more than a year to November 2023.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Smiths Group</strong> named former 3M Company director Paul Keel as its new chief executive, replacing Andy Reynolds Smith with immediate effect. “The change has been mutually agreed as the right time to provide new leadership as Smiths enters into its next growth phase,” the engineer said. The company added that it remains committed to the separation of Smiths Medical and is “actively engaging with all options”. Smiths had <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/andy-reynolds-smith-boss-of-smiths-group-set-to-leave-after-2bn-spin-off-2kcrdhc6d\">denied in December 2019</a> that Reynolds Smith would leave the business following the demerger of the medical division, which was postponed in the early stages of the pandemic. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>When the Fortnite maker <strong>Epic Games</strong> opened its case against <strong>Apple</strong>, legal analyst Nick Rodelli gave the software developer a one-in-three chance of prevailing.&#xa0;By the time Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers retired on Monday to consider her verdict Rodelli, who works for the investment research firm CFRA, put the chances at 55 per cent in Epic's favour. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc8fd505-2e75-4646-b2a7-34d32796f32a\">five takeaways</a> from the trial that could have big consequences for a billion iPhone users and thousands of app developers.</p> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> is relocating 100 bankers from London to offices in the EU and Asia as Germany's largest lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/891b2482-e15e-4c2f-8e51-9a4271599dc0\">accelerates a restructuring</a> of its corporate bank following Brexit. Under the plan, a quarter of the division's 400 UK staff are being made redundant, with their roles moved to Dublin, Berlin, Frankfurt and cities across Asia, according to people familiar with the decision.</p> <p>An Italian bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c02a6e97-5505-4d4a-933f-a0e934ca6eda\">has collapsed</a> because of exposure to Greensill Capital and GFG Alliance, as the shockwaves from the failure of the UK finance company claimed another casualty. Milan-based <strong>Aigis Banca</strong>, a specialist lender to small and medium-sized businesses, was ordered into liquidation by the Bank of Italy over the weekend, with larger peer Banca Ifis buying its assets and liabilities for the symbolic price of €1.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Activist investor Coast Capital has urged fellow shareholders&#xa0;in FirstGroup to vote against the sale of US bus assets to Swedish alternatives group&#xa0;EQT. Shareholders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/800e18fd-6e5d-43a2-a55c-1a8020f9f296\">should stay onboard</a> with management and back a deal.</p> <p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian <br></strong>The Federal Reserve is no longer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f9d00da-afb1-4b51-9a0f-6344df914bd8\">the markets' best friend</a> as it faces a tricky pivot.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Amigo thrown into crisis after court rejects survival plan' FT.com 25 May.
