  "text": "<p>Its miscalculation about demand and the shift in the market have been so costly that Peloton—a company worth nearly $50 billion about a year ago—has laid off thousands of people, had to borrow $750 million to head off a cash crunch and is exploring a sale of a minority stake. It is a reminder that strategic choices—not just pandemic forces—determine how businesses emerge from the crisis. Peloton's value fell to less than $5 billion this past week.</p><p>In late 2020—with homebound consumers clamoring for its bikes—Peloton's co-founder and longtime chief executive, John Foley, dismissed the idea that the company was growing too much based on a demand spike that could prove temporary.</p><p>\"Overbuilding supply-chain capacity—that's a term that has never come up in the Peloton senior leadership rooms or boardrooms,\" Mr. Foley said in a September 2020 call with analysts. \"We feel like there's such a massive opportunity that we need to invest heavily in the supply chain for years and years to maintain it. When you say 'normalize coming out of Covid,' we don't see that.\"</p><p>Many companies faced the same question during the pandemic: How best to handle a surge in demand? Procter &amp; Gamble Co. decided not to permanently expand toilet-paper factories that would have taken years to come online. Clorox Co. added capacity through contract manufacturers. To fill government orders for masks, Honeywell International Inc. and 3M Co. added shifts or retrofitted facilities.</p><p>Most of the leaders of those businesses realized that the sudden demand could be short-lived, or hedged their manufacturing investments.</p><p>Peloton chose to build permanent production capacity, believing that demand for its products would remain elevated for years and it could avoid ocean shipping logjams by operating U.S. sites. It struck a $420 million deal to buy Precor Inc., a maker of commercial exercise equipment with two U.S. factories. Then it announced plans for the Ohio factory. It was a major strategy shift for a brand that until then had largely relied on third-party manufacturers in Asia.</p><p>Though millions more people now subscribe to Peloton's online workout classes than before the pandemic, sales of equipment have fallen 40% from a year ago. The company recently said weak sales and losses will continue this year.</p><p>Even without the Ohio factory, Peloton is laying off hundreds of workers and is saddled with a glut of unsold inventory. It's a sharp reversal from June 2020 when Peloton had $230 million in backlogged orders for its products.</p><p>Barry McCarthy, a former Netflix Inc. and Spotify Technology SA finance executive who took over as Peloton's CEO in February, said the falloff in demand was foreseeable.</p><p>\"I don't care particularly why they thought that Covid was the new normal, except insofar as to inform me who should be on the bus,\" Mr. McCarthy said in an interview earlier this year, referring to his executive team and how he'll decide which leaders he'll replace. He has since brought in new executives to oversee Peloton's supply chain.</p><p>Mr. Foley, who remains executive chairman of Peloton's board after stepping down as CEO, declined to comment though the company. His co-founder, William Lynch, has resigned as president and is leaving the board. A Peloton spokesman declined to discuss the leadership's thinking around the manufacturing expansion plans.</p><p>Peloton's bikes and treadmills are equipped with a tabletlike screen that connects users to online workout classes. An instructor leading a spin class from a Peloton studio can remotely adjust the resistance on bikes connected to the class. A number of Peloton instructors have achieved celebrity status among users, some of whom opt to pay a lower subscription fee to access Peloton classes using standard stationary bicycles. Peloton's original bike, which initially sold for $2,245, now costs $1,445 after price cuts. The company last month raised the price of its connected workout subscription, which syncs with Peloton classes, to $44 a month, from $39 a month. A Peloton class membership that's not connected to the equipment costs $12.99 a month. Home stationary bikes from other manufacturers can cost anywhere from less than $1,000 to several thousand dollars.</p><p>Headed into the pandemic, Peloton, which Mr. Foley co-founded in 2012, was losing money but notching steady growth. The U.S. outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020 sent sales surging almost instantly. For the period ended June 30 of that year, subscriber growth more than doubled from the previous quarter and revenue for the company's bikes and treadmills nearly tripled from the year before. Peloton was profitable for the first time.</p><p>The good times were short-lived. As demand soared throughout the year and a second Covid wave derailed Americans' hopes of a quick return to normalcy, Peloton became overwhelmed by a crush of orders, which was exacerbated by massive port delays in Asia, where Peloton built its machines. Mr. Foley assured customers and investors that the company was keeping up. But behind the scenes, Peloton was in chaos. Customer-service operations were overwhelmed as people who were paying thousands for their machines faced monthslong waits and repeated, last-minute delays.</p><p>In November of 2020, Mr. Foley apologized and said that Peloton was underperforming. A few months later the company said it would delay the launch of a new treadmill, double its customer-service operations and begin shipping products by air. Peloton acquired Precor and, in early 2021, announced plans to build the Ohio factory.</p><p>That summer, with Covid vaccines widely available and gyms starting to reopen, Peloton lowered the price of its bike by about 20%, though it said the cut didn't reflect weaker sales. Three months later, Peloton scrapped its annual forecast while reporting its smallest quarterly subscriber gain since it became a public company.</p><p>Peloton would miss its quarterly forecast every quarter thereafter, including in Mr. McCarthy's first partial period as CEO.</p><p>\"Routinely companies get caught in this, building too much and then having to write off inventory and do fire sales,\" said Ravi Anupindi, a University of Michigan professor who studies supply chains. The pandemic, with its drastic demand spikes, exacerbated that phenomenon, he said. \"Companies see an increase in demand and become overly enthusiastic, and that's the critical mistake.\"</p><p>Clorox doubled production of some of its most in-demand products, like sanitizing wipes, but stopped short of adding a factory. Rather it enlisted outside manufacturers, hired temporary workers and added lines to existing factories, CEO Linda Rendle said. </p><p>Peloton's new CEO, Barry McCarthy, took the reins when his predecessor, who had pushed for the expansion, stepped aside.

As the nation's toilet-paper shortage became fodder for late-night talk show hosts, P&amp;G CEO Jon Moeller, then the company's finance chief, said machinery required to make toilet paper was too costly and took too long to build to justify adding more for a demand spike that was unlikely to last. The company took steps to increase toilet paper production in other ways, including running factories 24/7 and bringing idled machinery back online, to meet demand.</p><p>Early in the pandemic, Honeywell set up new N95 mask production lines at existing facilities in Phoenix and Rhode Island. Those expansions created more than 1,000 jobs—and were funded in part through government contracts.</p><p>With the contracts completed and demand for the masks down, Honeywell was left with excess capacity a year later. The company stopped production at the sites and laid off about 500 workers in Rhode Island and 700 in Phoenix about a year ago.</p><p>At another site in Chandler, Ariz., Honeywell set up a new N95 production facility early in the pandemic and revamped that site with automated equipment in 2021 to cut production costs in half. Honeywell is in the process of shutting down that facility this year, laying off another 120 people.</p><p>Leaving the new manufacturing lines in places didn't make sense, CEO Darius Adamczyk said in July 2021, because they were built with speed in mind. \"We did that because the country needed us to do it. We didn't do it to maximize profit,\" he said on a conference call.</p><p>Earlier this year, Honeywell sold some of the manufacturing equipment at auction.</p><p>Montreal-based Medicom Group, which makes surgical masks in Georgia, said its expanded facilities there are still operating at high capacity because of its longstanding relationships with dental customers and medical distributors.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How have your exercise habits changed over the course of the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Chief Operating Officer Guillaume Laverdure said some newer mask-making competitors have shut down because they were too reliant on demand that existed only at the peak of the pandemic. \"The factory is running at full speed, as we speak,\" he said.</p><p>Back in Ohio, state and local officials had cheered Peloton's expansion there. The plant was to add 2,000 jobs to the region. A company spokesman said the factory is now expected to cost $90 million to $100 million since Peloton isn't equipping it with machinery.</p><p>The state has seen an influx of companies building manufacturing and other operations there, both to meet surging demand and to address problems caused by global supply-chain snarls. A number of U.S. companies, like chip maker Intel Corp., have opted to add suppliers and production facilities in the U.S.</p><p>Last year, First Solar Inc., the biggest American-owned solar-panel maker, announced plans to build a $680 million factory about 10 miles from the Peloton site. Amazon built a fulfillment center nearby, following through on plans made before the pandemic. </p><p>Peloton expects to sell its factory in Luckey, Ohio, after construction is finished. PHOTO: Brian Day for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Peloton's reversal was a disappointment, said J.P. Nauseef, CEO of JobsOhio, an economic development nonprofit, adding that the blow is lessened by the fact that the company will finish building it and find a buyer.</p><p>\"I felt for the team and the people who would lose their jobs,\" said Mr. Nauseef. \"But given the circumstances it's about as good a situation as you could have anticipated.\"</p><p>—Thomas Gryta and Austen Hufford contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>This Half-Built Ohio Factory Shows How Peloton Mismanaged the Pandemic</p>",
