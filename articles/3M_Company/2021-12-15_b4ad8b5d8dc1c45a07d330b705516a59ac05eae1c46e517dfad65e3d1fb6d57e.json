  "title": "3M Reaches Deal With Neogen  ----  By Cara Lombardo and Patrick Thomas",
  "text": "<p>   3M Corp. on Tuesday agreed to combine its food-safety business with Neogen Corp., a food testing and animal healthcare specialist, to create a combined company valued at $9.3 billion, including debt. </p><p>   Neogen, based in Lansing, Mich., has a market value of $4.3 billion, while 3M's is around $100 billion. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported such a deal was imminent. </p><p>   3M is based in St. Paul, Minn., and sells everything from Post-it Notes to Nexcare bandages and N95 masks. The food-safety business is part of its healthcare business, one of its four major units. </p><p>   The deal is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust, a tax-efficient way for companies to sell off a division, with Neogen's management team running the combined company. It values the 3M unit at $5.3 billion. Existing 3M shareholders will own 50.1% of the combined company. </p><p>   Many of 3M's industrial conglomerate peers such as General Electric Co. and Emerson Electric Co. have been splitting up or shedding assets in response to investor demand for focused companies. </p><p>   Neogen offers test kits and other products to help track sanitation and allergens everywhere in the food-supply chain from \"the farm gate to the dinner plate.\" </p><p>   Neogen's chief executive officer, John Adent, who will lead the combined company, said in an interview that talks about the deal stretch back to 2019. He said it would create a more efficient food-safety company with a balance sheet primed for future deals. \"It gives us the scale we need,\" he said. </p><p>   He said the company will be poised to benefit from an increased demand for food-safety products as consumers get more interested about what is in their food. </p><p>   The deal would expand Neogen's product offerings and its research and development capabilities, the companies said. The combination would make Neogen's food-safety segment about 70% of its total revenue. </p><p></p>",
