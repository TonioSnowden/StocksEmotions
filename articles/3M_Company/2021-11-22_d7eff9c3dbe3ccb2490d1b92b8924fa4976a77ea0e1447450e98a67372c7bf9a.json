  "text": "<p>The new chief executive of Smiths Group has launched a robust defence of the UK company's conglomerate structure, dismissing the notion that the manufacturer of everything from airport baggage scanners to satellite parts needs to slim down.</p> <p>Paul Keel, a US executive who took the top job at Smiths in May, said that keeping the group intact would not saddle its valuation with a discount even as GE and Toshiba, two of the world's best-known conglomerates, this month announced plans to break up.</p> <p>“There's nothing broken with this company,” Keel told the Financial Times. “If we can execute better, get a little more growth, we will be among the most highly valued in our peer group.”</p> <p>The contention that Smiths needs to improve its performance rather than change its structure comes weeks after the group agreed to sell its misfiring medical division for $2.7bn. </p> <p>Keel, a veteran of the industrial sector whose career has included spells at GE and 3M, said that the diversity of its businesses helps shield the company against downturns in any one sector.</p> <p>He pointed to the success of industrial conglomerates such as Honeywell and Danaher and the countless examples of companies focused on a single sector that had failed.</p> <p>“The common denominator is not structure. It's not multi-segment or pure-play,” he said. “The common denominator is performance.” </p> <p>However, the new CEO, who replaced Andrew Reynolds Smith, is under pressure to end a period of lacklustre revenue growth. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, the group has mustered average annual revenue growth of just 0.3 per cent over the past decade.</p> <p>Keel last week laid out medium-term earnings targets that aim for annual revenue growth of 4 per cent to 6 per cent.</p> <p>Smiths is aiming to generate between £400m and £500m of extra revenue in the next three to five years through new products such as fibre optic satellite components and lightning-resistant gas piping. To help achieve that, the group also plans to sell its scanners to port and border authorities and apply its seals to hydrogen and methane projects.</p> <p>The disposal of the medical business was welcomed by investors, but Mark Fielding, an analyst at RBC, said that the company will need to show evidence that its performance is improving.</p> <p>“The market will be sceptical about pricing in a growth rate change without evidence as while there does seem a positive cultural shift many of these aspirations are not new to Smiths,” said Fielding.</p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey 2021 'Smiths CEO defends conglomerate structure as GE and Toshiba break up' FT.com 22 November.
