  "text": "<p>\n  MICHAEL J. CUDAHY </p><p>\n  1924-2022 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  As a boy, Michael J. Cudahy was known for pranks. </p><p>\n  When his father was U.S. ambassador to Poland, young Mike taught himself to make exploding cigarettes. One of them singed the mustache of a Polish general at a diplomatic reception. </p><p>\n  He later skipped college and had trouble settling into a career. </p><p>\n  In his 40s, however, Mr. Cudahy co-founded Marquette Electronics Inc., a pioneering maker of medical equipment that withstood competition from far larger companies, including 3M Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co. </p><p>\n  Marquette, based in Milwaukee, got off to a rocky start in the mid-1960s. Some of the company's early electrocardiogram, or EKG, machines leaked so much electricity that they might have risked electrocuting patients, Mr. Cudahy wrote later. After product quality improved, Marquette thrived as an international supplier of high-tech hospital equipment, including patient-monitoring devices. </p><p>\n  A self-described \"benevolent dictator,\" Mr. Cudahy spurned such corporate conventions as meetings and organizational charts. His factory workers didn't have to punch the clock and were on an honor system. His office cafeteria offered beer and wine at lunchtime. Mr. Cudahy, who liked a glass of Early Times whiskey with his lunch, trusted his colleagues not to overindulge. </p><p>\n  He sold the company to General Electric Co. for about $824 million in 1998. Mr. Cudahy then devoted himself to philanthropy and civic causes in Milwaukee, notably a renovation of the Pabst Theater, featuring a new space called Cudahy's Irish Pub. He died March 11 his home in the Milwaukee suburb of Cedarburg. He was 97. </p><p></p>",
