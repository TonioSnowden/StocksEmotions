The question now is: are there circumstances in which what still amounts to dollar dominance could suddenly turn into a <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/408d4065-f66d-4368-9095-c6a8743b0d01\">dollar rout</a>?</p> <p><strong>The Fed is no longer markets' best friend </strong>Having waited for too long, the central bank faces a policy pivot — as it is hostage to a “new monetary framework” that is ill-suited for the pandemic-related structural changes to the economy.

YouTube is testing an “applause” feature and Facebook wants to make it easier for fans to pay. But tipping is not just a way for users to show their appreciation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d97ae47-d716-4595-9944-ed05f9dfe1f6\">says Elaine Moore</a>, it is a way to outsource payment altogether.</p> <p><strong>Celebration of breaking the mould in later life </strong>The new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af40b6a2-297a-4d25-a7dc-29b703eacad5\">podcast <em>Growing Old Disgracefully</em></a> is, according to its intro, made up of “remarkable stories told by remarkable people”. Most contributors are over the age of 70 and, as such, are people we seldom hear from in podcasting. More importantly, all have made a choice in their later years that demolishes stereotypes.</p> <h2>Podcast of the day</h2> <p><strong>Bitcoin: ‘I'll either be rich, or wrong'</strong> When 29-year-old Sam found out that his younger brother had made £30,000 trading bitcoin, he couldn't believe what he was hearing.
