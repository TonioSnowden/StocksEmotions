  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Kirkland  Can Advise  3M Unit in  Bankruptcy  ----  By Akiko Matsuda",
  "text": "<p>   A bankruptcy judge will allow Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP to represent 3M Co.'s earplug unit Aearo Technologies LLC in its chapter 11 case, rejecting objections raised by earplug lawsuit claimants and the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog. </p><p>   Judge Jeffrey Graham of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis on Thursday shot down concerns over Kirkland's potential conflict of interest in representing Aearo in its bankruptcy because the law firm also advises parent 3M in its mass earplug cases. Roughly 230,000 claimants sued the company, alleging 3M earplugs have caused hearing loss. </p><p>   Judge Graham said he believed the goals for 3M and its bankrupt unit Aearo are aligned at this point because they both aim to resolve valid injury claims. \"This is not an easy call because of the myriad of factors,\" he said. \"But ultimately, I do believe that Kirkland Ellis is disinterested and not adverse based upon the unique facts of this case.\" </p><p>   3M placed Aearo, the earplug manufacturing unit, under chapter 11 protection in July to shift the injury lawsuits to bankruptcy court. The strategy hasn't worked out as planned as Judge Graham declined to extend Aearo's litigation shield to 3M, and the mass lawsuits are continuing against 3M in federal court in Pensacola, Fla. </p><p>   During the court hearing on Wednesday, lawyers representing the earplug injury claimants said Kirkland can't be loyal to Aearo as its bankruptcy counsel because Kirkland lawyers pushed Aearo into chapter 11 for the sole purpose of managing 3M's litigation risks. </p><p>   \"It was an offshoot of the combat arms litigation that they got paid $173 million,\" said Robert Pfister, one of the lawyers representing injury claimants, noting that Kirkland conceived the bankruptcy plan while representing 3M for the mass injury litigation, for which it received $173 million in fees. </p><p>   The U.S. Trustee said Kirkland's duty as 3M's litigation counsel is to minimize the parent company's liabilities. Its role in Aearo conflicts with that because Aearo's bankruptcy case depends on 3M's commitment to provide unlimited funding toward resolving the earplug litigation in return for a full release from liability, and as counsel to Aearo, Kirkland has a fiduciary duty to maximize 3M's contribution. </p><p>   Mark McKane, litigator at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, disagreed and said Kirkland is \"uniquely qualified\" to represent Aearo in the bankruptcy case because it has been advising not only 3M but also Aearo in the mass earplug lawsuits. The interests of Aearo and 3M have been aligned in this matter because they both deny liability and seek to settle or resolve it. </p><p></p>",
