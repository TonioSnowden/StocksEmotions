  "title": "3M to Spin Off Healthcare Business; Earplugs Unit Files for Bankruptcy; Conglomerate takes $1.2 billion charge as Aearo subsidiary faces veterans' claims of hearing damage",
  "text": "<p>The company said it has committed $1 billion to fund a trust to pay claims about its earplugs and $240 million to fund expected expenses related to the cases. 3M said it would provide more funding if required. The company filed for bankruptcy for Aearo Technologies, a subsidiary that once made the earplugs, as a way to fence off the litigation from the rest of 3M.</p><p>Spinoffs have become popular with industrial conglomerates, including General Electric Co., as executives look for ways to distinguish business lines with the potential for better sales and profit growth. Many of 3M's businesses have had anemic growth rates in recent years, causing some analysts and investors to urge the company to pursue a breakup.</p><p>Executives had argued the company's diverse portfolio of hundreds of businesses and thousands of products benefited from being together because they shared research and common materials, such as adhesives. Going forward, 3M will consist of three business groups: safety and industrial products, consumers products and electronics and transportation. The company is forecasting that these businesses will have annual sales of $26.8 billion.</p><p>\"The connection between healthcare and the rest of the company is more limited than the businesses that will make up the new 3M,\" said Chief Executive Mike Roman during a conference call.</p><p>3M shareholders will receive shares in the new company. The health business lines had sales of about $8.6 billion in 2021, the company said. The new company will include 3M's products for wound care, oral care, healthcare information technology and biopharma filtration, 3M said.</p><p>3M, based in St. Paul, Minn., expects to retain a 19.9% stake in the new company and said the stake will be monetized over time. The company expects to complete the spinoff by the end of 2023.</p><p>The maker of Scotch tape and Post-it Notes on Tuesday reported a drop in second-quarter revenue and profit and cut its full-year sales and earnings outlook as it grapples with a stronger dollar and uncertain economic environment that affects consumer and industrial spending patterns.</p><p>3M's shares were recently trading up 6.3% at $142.57.</p><p>More than 100,000 U.S. military veterans have filed lawsuits against 3M over hearing damage linked to what they claim are defects in the company's military-grade earplugs.</p><p>3M bought Aearo Technologies for $1.2 billion in 2008.</p><p>The Chapter 11 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis comes after 3M began court-ordered settlement talks earlier this month with lawyers representing military veterans. Lawyers for 3M and the soldiers have completed 16 bellwether trials designed to inform the negotiations, of which plaintiffs won 10 and 3M won six; eight others were dismissed.</p><p>Bankruptcy offers powerful tools for corporate defendants to settle injury lawsuits and is a recourse that other large U.S. companies and nonprofits in recent years have used to resolve mass product-liability claims.</p><p>In addition to the bankruptcy filing, Aearo filed a lawsuit against earplug plaintiffs aiming to stop them from pursuing claims outside of bankruptcy against the publicly traded parent company 3M.</p><p>Bryan Aylstock, the court-appointed lead plaintiffs' counsel, said, \"we will challenge this bankruptcy filing and are confident 3M will fail in the courts.\"</p><p>3M and Aearo Technologies have said the earplugs were effective and safe when they were used properly.</p><p>The charges tied to the earplug litigation weighed on 3M's quarterly results. Earnings for the period ended June 30 plunged to $78 million, or 14 cents a share, from $1.52 billion, or $2.59 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>Will Feuer and Alexander Gladstone contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>3M to Spin Off Healthcare Business; Earplugs Unit Files for Bankruptcy</p>",
