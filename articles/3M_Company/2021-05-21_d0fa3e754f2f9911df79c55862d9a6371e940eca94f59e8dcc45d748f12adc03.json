  "text": "<p>The career of Spencer Silver, the American chemist at 3M who created a unique adhesive that brought the Post-it note into being, is a glowing example of how important serendipity and persistence are to innovation. Silver, who has died aged 80, set out to make a strong adhesive for aircraft production. Failing in that, he co-created one of the most ubiquitous office products ever conceived.</p> <p>Silver's achievement has an honoured place among accidental inventions and discoveries that include penicillin, cornflakes and the microwave oven. The not-too-sticky adhesive was, <a href=\"https://news.3m.com/English/3m-stories/3m-details/2021/Spencer-Silver-co-inventor-of-3M-Post-it-Notes-dies-at-80/default.aspx\">he acknowledged</a>, a “solution waiting for a problem to solve”. The breakthrough came when fellow 3M employee Art Fry saw a use for it to anchor a bookmark in his hymn book. Altogether it took 12 years from Silver's invention to the launch of the Post-it note in 1980. </p> <p>The original small, square, canary-yellow notes, billions of which are sold annually, are available today in fuchsia, green, orange, pink and blue, some with much stickier adhesives. Variants include “Post-it Extreme Notes”, more durable and water-resistant, and even Virtual Post-it notes created for computers in the form of desktop notes.</p> <p>Spencer Ferguson Silver III was born in San Antonio, Texas, on February 6 1941. His father was an accountant and his mother a secretary. He graduated from Arizona State University with a bachelors degree in chemistry in 1962 and four years later earned a PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Soon he joined 3M, working on pressure-sensitive adhesives.</p> <p>Failing in his aim to develop a superstrong adhesive, in 1968 he devised one that stuck lightly to surfaces. Based on acrylate copolymer microspheres, tiny bubbles that “kind of sparkled in the light”, it was strong enough to hold paper together but could be removed and stuck again — repeatedly — without damaging the paper.</p> <p>Silver was certain it was a breakthrough, but for what he did not know. “I felt my adhesive was so obviously unique that I began to give seminars throughout 3M in the hope I would spark an idea among its product developers,” he told the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f08e8a9a-fcd7-11df-ae2d-00144feab49a\">Financial Times in 2010</a>. He promoted his adhesive so assiduously that he was known as “Mr Persistent”.</p> <p>Fry, a chemical engineer in the tape division lab, heard about Silver's adhesive in 1974 from a colleague and attended one of his seminars. Later, he thought it might stop his page marker from falling out while singing in a church choir. He used Silver's adhesive to create a bookmark that stuck but did not tear pages when removed. </p> <p>After testing this on co-workers, he sent a report to his supervisor with a note on the front written on a piece of the bookmark; the supervisor wrote his answer on the same paper, stuck it back on to the front, and returned it. “It was a eureka, head-flapping moment,” Fry told FT. “I can still feel the excitement.”</p> <p>The two men tested a prototype product at 3M offices. The pale yellow was chosen by chance, from the colour of scrap paper used by the lab next door. The product was tried out unsuccessfully in 1977 under the name Press 'n Peel, but it was boosted a year later when 3M flooded offices in Boise, Idaho, with free samples; 90 per cent of recipients said they would buy them. In 1980, 3M introduced Post-it notes nationally, and in Canada and Europe soon after.</p> <p>“The Post-it notes took off so rapidly,” Silver told CNN in 2013, “that I think it left a lot of people in marketing and sales gasping a little bit.” “It was always a self-advertising product,” he added, because customers would put the notes on documents they sent to others, arousing the recipient's curiosity. The Post-it even became a cultural emblem. Artists have used it and it has appeared in films and television dramas. Post-its have also been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p> <p>Silver spent 30 years at 3M, rising to be corporate researcher, its top technical title, before retiring in 1996. He earned 37 patents and won awards including the 1998 American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention, according to the company. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the Minnesota Science &amp; Technology Hall of Fame.</p> <p>Silver is survived by Linda, his wife of 56 years, his daughter Jennifer and two grandchildren. The invention did not make him or Fry extremely wealthy, though Silver said in 2013 he enjoyed a “comfortable retirement”, and added: “The fact that the Post-it notes just exploded as a product is more than I could ever hope for.”</p> <p><em>The writer was formerly the FT's business and employment editor</em></p><p>Source: Brian Groom 2021 'Spencer Silver, chemist and inventor 1941-2021' FT.com 21 May.
