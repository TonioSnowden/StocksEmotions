  "title": "3M Sales Fall as Weaker Consumer Demand, Strong Dollar Pressure Results; Inflation's impact prompts the maker of Scotch tape and other products to cut its full-year outlook",
  "text": "<p>3M executives said Tuesday that inflation continues to drive up the cost of materials and other expenses, while companies' moves to raise prices and pass along higher production costs are discouraging consumer spending, particularly in electronics, where 3M supplies materials. The company said demand for back-to-school products this summer was weaker than expected because higher prices diminished consumers' purchasing power.</p><p>\"Inflationary pressures remain persistent and broad based,\" said Monish Patolawala, chief financial officer, during a conference call with analysts.</p><p>3M's shares were down slightly at $117.84 at midday on Tuesday, while major U.S. stock indexes moved higher.</p><p>The St. Paul, Minn.-based company said the strong U.S. dollar lowered its sales in the quarter by about 5%, with unfavorable exchange rates reducing 3M's sales in foreign currencies when they are converted into dollars. The company predicted that foreign-currency translations would reduce sales for the year by about 4.5%, compared with its previous forecast of 4%.</p><p>Sales of disposable masks declined by $130 million during the quarter from a year earlier, the company said.</p><p>3M said it is proceeding with the spinoff of its healthcare business into a separate, public company. 3M continues to defend itself against personal-injury lawsuits filed over earplugs that the company produced for the military, and chemicals produced years ago that were used in 3M's Scotchgard fabric coating and other products.</p><p>The company's Aearo Technologies subsidiary, which produced the earplugs that veterans have alleged were defective, filed for bankruptcy protection this summer in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement with plaintiffs.</p><p>3M said it now expects sales for 2022 to decline by a range of 3% to 3.5% from 2021's level, compared with the company's prior projection of a 0.5% to 2.5% decline. Adjusted earnings for 2022 are expected to be between $10.10 a share and $10.35 a share, the company said, down from its prior range of $10.30 a share to $10.80 a share.</p><p>Overall, for the three months ended Sept. 30, 3M reported a profit of $3.86 billion, or $6.77 a share, compared with $1.43 billion, or $2.45 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the quarter fell to $8.62 billion from $8.94 billion, missing Wall Street analysts' expectations of $8.71 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com and Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>3M Sales Fall as Weaker Consumer Demand, Strong Dollar Pressure Results</p>",
