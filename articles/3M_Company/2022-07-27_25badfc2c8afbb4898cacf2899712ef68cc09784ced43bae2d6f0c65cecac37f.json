  "title": "Technology:  3M to Spin Off Healthcare;  Shields Itself From Ear Suits  ----  By Bob Tita",
  "text": "<p>    3M Co. said it would spin off its healthcare business as a public company and sought bankruptcy protection for a subsidiary that once produced military earplugs that thousands of veterans blame for damaging their hearing. </p><p>    The moves Tuesday attempt to address the industrial conglomerate's lingering overhangs with sluggish growth of its businesses and an increasing exposure to lawsuit costs. </p><p>   The company said it has committed $1 billion to fund a trust to pay claims about its earplugs and $240 million to fund expected expenses related to the cases. 3M said it would provide more funding if required. The company filed for bankruptcy for Aearo Technologies, a subsidiary that once made the earplugs, as a way to fence off the litigation from the rest of 3M. </p><p>   Going forward, 3M will consist of three business groups: safety and industrial products, consumers products and electronics and transportation. The company is forecasting that these businesses will have annual sales of $26.8 billion. </p><p>   3M shareholders will receive shares in the new company. </p><p></p>",
