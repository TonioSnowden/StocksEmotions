  "text": "<p>3M is based in St. Paul, Minn., and sells everything from Post-It Notes to Nexcare bandages and N95 masks. The food-safety business is part of its healthcare business, one of its four major units.</p><p>The deal is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust, a tax-efficient way for companies to sell off a division, with Neogen's management team running the combined company. It values the 3M unit at $5.3 billion. Existing 3M shareholders will own 50.1% of the combined company.</p><p>Many of 3M's industrial conglomerate peers such as General Electric Co. and Emerson Electric Co. have been splitting up or shedding assets in response to investor demand for focused companies.</p><p>Neogen offers test kits and other products to help track sanitation and allergens everywhere in the food supply chain from \"the farm gate to the dinner plate.\"</p><p>Neogen's chief executive officer, John Adent, who will lead the combined company, said in an interview that talks about the deal stretch back to 2019. He said it will create a more efficient food-safety company with a balance sheet primed for future deals. \"It gives us the scale we need,\" he said.</p><p>The deal would expand Neogen's product offerings and its research and development capabilities, the companies said. The combination would make Neogen's food safety segment about 70% of its total revenue and the combined company would have projected sales of about $1 billion in the first full year post-closing.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com</p><p>3M Agrees to Combine Its Food-Safety Unit With Neogen</p>",
