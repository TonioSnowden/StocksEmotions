They are the races in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p><p>Both TransDigm, an aerospace and defense company, and Cintas, which provides uniforms and other products to businesses, are based in Ohio, the state that Vance seeks to represent in the Senate as he battles his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan.</p><p>The giving by the two companies' CEOs could be an effort to make a connection with a powerful fellow Ohioan, according to Michael Beckel, research director at Issue One, a nonpartisan watchdog group that aims to reduce the influence of big money in politics.</p><p>\"It makes sense that Ohio-based companies would want a good relationship with their senator,\" Beckel told MarketWatch.</p><p>TransDigm and Cintas didn't respond to requests for comment, while Vance's campaign declined to comment.</p><p>Vance is \"controversial,\" but Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman has backed him, noted Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that pushes for better transparency around corporate political spending.</p><p>\"The fact that Portman, who had been viewed as a moderate, has endorsed him, would make a contribution by a corporate person, let's say, more acceptable,\" Freed told MarketWatch.</p><p>Portman's decision to retire led to the Ryan-Vance race.</p><p>Vance won Ohio's GOP Senate primary after getting former President Donald Trump's endorsement despite his past criticism of Trump. His campaign also has gotten attention for benefiting from a $15 million contribution from billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel.</p><p>Vance last month responded to a MarketWatch questionnaire about his stances, saying he wants to end tax loopholes for tech companies and ban congressional stock trading.</p><p>See: Republican Senate candidate J.D.
