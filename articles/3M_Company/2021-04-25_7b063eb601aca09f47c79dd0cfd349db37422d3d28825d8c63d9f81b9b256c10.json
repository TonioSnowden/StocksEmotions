  "text": "<h2>Earnings</h2> <h4>Big tech</h4> <p>Advertising figures will be in the spotlight when Google's parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> reports this week. An unexpected surge of advertising in the final months of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad31fe98-741c-46ce-9dd8-63fc32eb0d8e\">last year</a> lifted Google's revenues far above Wall Street forecasts.</p> <p>Alphabet's revenue grew 13 per cent for the year as a whole, even as non-digital sectors of the global advertising industry contracted about 20 per cent.</p> <p>A boom in PC sales, surging demand for video-gaming and increased usage of cloud services are expected to drive up revenues for <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/720ba9e9-8cea-4583-b26e-d98a74c4db21\">Last quarter</a>, the company produced a 17 per cent surge in revenue, to $43.1bn. The jump belied Wall Street expectations that the US software company's growth rate would slow to less than 10 per cent.</p> <p>Sales of iPads and in its wearables unit, which includes AirPods and the Apple Watch, are expected to boost earnings for <strong>Apple</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sales in all five of the $2.4tn company's product categories grew at double-digit percentages <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39157bd8-12ac-4b54-b4e3-8d6432d8abf6\">in January</a>, with the iPhone being the group's slowest-growing category because of supply constraints and the delayed launch of its first 5G-enabled smartphones.</p> <p>A push into ecommerce during coronavirus lockdowns bore fruit for <strong>Facebook</strong>, which posted record quarterly revenues in January. But the forecast might be uncertain for this quarter after chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4f14d0-a30e-43e5-a8fc-e680d15e3261\">Mark Zuckerberg warned</a> of a growing competitive threat from Apple.</p> <p>Zuckerberg cited Apple's forthcoming privacy changes to the iOS 14 operating system, which requires applications on iPhones to obtain users' permission to harvest advertisement targeting and tracking data.</p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong>'s initiative to ramp up its infrastructure to offer one-day shipping, the growth in other parts of the business and rising figures for its Prime subscriptions are expected to boost the ecommerce giant's earnings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d65b5fa8-4445-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c\">Amazon's earnings</a> over the festive period far surpassed analysts' expectations last quarter. The retailer exceeded revenue estimates, but it was strong net income that surprised investors most: $3.3bn versus a consensus of $1.97bn, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p> <h4>Banks</h4> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> reports this week after suffering a 68 per cent plunge in the fourth quarter and warning that the long-term impact of coronavirus was still uncertain, with the true fallout disguised by government and central bank support programmes.</p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong>, which unveiled a strategic shift to Asia and retreat from the west, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb321081-434e-43f4-b9e7-13354afdfc5f\">pledging</a> to invest $6bn to expand in Hong Kong, China and Singapore, while selling its US retail arm and its French consumer bank, is publishing its earnings this week.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds</strong>, <strong>NatWest</strong> and <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> also report this week.</p> <p>Provisions for bad loans and writedowns in the value of some of <strong>Santander</strong>'s businesses are expected to affect the lender's results.</p> <p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94faa98d-7b77-4d8c-8216-b73ce9ad1d81\">the loss of €8.8bn</a> was exacerbated by new costs related mainly to restructuring in Santander's Spanish businesses in the fourth quarter. However, the bank predicted a rebound in profitability in 2021.</p> <p>A surge in bond and rates trading revenue is likely to boost <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>'s net profit, when Germany's largest lender reports.</p> <p>Last quarter, Deutsche made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/098222ba-7701-4963-bc89-45370be359cf\">a net profit</a> for the first time in six years on the back of a global trading boom. The bank reported a net profit of €113m for 2020, the first since 2014 and higher than expected by analysts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Payment groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2637f6d1-ed91-4999-ba4c-03e2d227e3e9\">Visa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/97fa60a8-abaa-4e3f-a00d-2361eefee24c\">Mastercard</a> also report this week.</p> <h4>Energy</h4> <p>Some of the world's biggest energy groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d89f65d1-0c73-4575-aa11-8e770f8d90bd\">reported record annual losses</a> in the last quarter, marking a brutal 12 months for an industry under mounting pressure to speed up a transition to cleaner fuels. Both <strong>ExxonMobil</strong>, the US's biggest oil producer, and <strong>BP</strong>, the UK energy group, will update investors.</p> <p>ExxonMobil racked up losses of more than $20bn last year — the first annual loss in its history, while BP recorded its first annual loss since the Deepwater Horizon disaster more than a decade ago after fourth-quarter profits plunged 96 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Total</strong>, which will also issue its results this week, in February joined the list of oil majors reporting multibillion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c93f7ed-cd30-4507-aa2b-856ed779863b\">full-year losses</a>, but it provided a rare glimmer of hope in the pandemic-stricken sector by beating fourth-quarter expectations and maintaining its dividend.</p> <p>Other companies to watch this week include electric-car maker <strong>Tesla</strong>, drugmaker <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, coffee chain <strong>Starbucks</strong>, aerospace manufacturer <strong>Boeing</strong>, British drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>, KFC's owner <strong>YUM! Brands</strong>, foodmaker <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong> and fast-food chain <strong>McDonalds</strong>.</p> <h1>Key reports</h1> <h4>Monday</h4> <p>Canadian National Railway; Tesla; Pearson</p> <h4>Tuesday</h4> <p>3M; Advanced Micro Devices; Alphabet; Amgen; BP; Centene; Ecolab; Eli Lilly; Fiserv; General Electric; HSBC; Illumina; Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies; Microsoft; Mondelez International; Roper Industries; Sherwin-Williams; Starbucks; Stryker; Texas Instruments; United Parcel Service; Vale; Visa; Waste Management; Novartis; Whitbread; Focusrite; Aveva; IWG; PZ Cussons</p> <h4>Wednesday</h4> <p>ADP; Apple; Boeing; Boston Scientific; Equinix; Facebook; GlaxoSmithKline; Humana; Moody's; Norfolk Southern; Qualcomm; Sanofi; ServiceNow; Deutsche Bank; eBay; Ford Motor; Shopify; Spotify; YUM!

The IHS Markit eurozone flash purchasing managers' index for services rose to 50.3 in April, from 49.6 in March.</p> <p>China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index for April, out on Friday, will be closely watched for signs of further expansion as the country's economic recovery continues.</p> <p>Factory activity in the country beat expectations to rise to 51.9 in March, according to official figures from the National Bureau of Statistics. A reading higher than 50 signals expansion.</p> <p>Data released earlier this month showed that gross domestic product leapt by a record amount year on year in the first quarter, though the rise was flattered by a contraction a year earlier owing to the pandemic. </p> <p>Non-manufacturing PMI data, also out on Friday and which leapt to 56.3 in March, will indicate the role of China's services sector in the recovery.</p> <h1>Key data and events</h1> <h4>Monday</h4> <p><strong>Germany, Ifo expectations (Apr)</strong></p> <h4>Tuesday</h4> <p><strong>US, consumer confidence (Apr)</strong></p> <p><strong>Sweden; Hungary; Japan, rate decisions</strong></p> <h4>Wednesday</h4> <p><strong>Japan, retail sales (Mar)</strong></p> <p><strong>Australia, CPI (Q1) </strong></p> <p><strong>Germany, GfK consumer confidence (May)</strong></p> <p><strong>France, consumer confidence (Apr, Index)</strong></p> <p><strong>Canada, retail sales (Feb)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, rate decision</strong></p> <h4>Thursday</h4> <p><strong>Sweden, GDP (Q1)</strong></p> <p><strong>Germany, unemployment rate (Apr)</strong></p> <p><strong>Eurozone, consumer confidence (Apr)</strong></p> <p><strong>Germany, CPI (Apr, flash)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, initial jobless claims</strong></p> <p><strong>US, real GDP (Q1)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, real consumer spending (Q1)</strong></p> <p><strong>Egypt, rate decision</strong></p> <h4>Friday</h4> <p><strong>Japan, jobless rate (Mar)</strong></p> <p><strong>Japan, industrial production (Mar, preliminary)</strong></p> <p><strong>Japan, manufacturing PMI (Apr, final)</strong></p> <p><strong>China, NBS non-manufacturing PMI (Apr, Index)</strong></p> <p><strong>China, NBS manufacturing PMI (Apr, Index)</strong></p> <p><strong>France, GDP (Q1, flash)</strong></p> <p><strong>France, CPI (Apr, flash)</strong></p> <p><strong>Spain; Germany; Italy, GDP (Q1, flash)</strong></p> <p><strong>Eurozone, HICP (Apr, flash)</strong></p> <p><strong>Eurozone, GDP (Q1)</strong></p> <p><strong>Canada, GDP (Feb)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, personal income (Mar)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, personal spending (Mar)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, core PCE inflation (Mar)</strong></p> <p><strong>US, University of Michigan sentiment (Apr)</strong></p> <p><strong>Colombia, rate decision</strong></p><p>Source: FT Reporters 2021 'US tech and UK banks head earnings bonanza, Fed rate meeting' FT.com 25 April.
