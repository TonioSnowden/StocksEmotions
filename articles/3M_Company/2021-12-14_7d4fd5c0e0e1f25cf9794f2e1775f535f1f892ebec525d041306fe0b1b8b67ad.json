  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 167.16 points, or 0.5%, to 35,483.79.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 54.64 points, or 1.2%, at 4,614.33.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 275.44 points, or 1.8%, to 15,137.84.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow fell by 320.04 points, or 0.9%, to 35,650.95, the lowest closing value since Dec. 6, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also lost ground.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Stocks fell after data showed the U.S. November producer-price index rose 0.8%. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.5% advance. The increase in wholesale prices in the past year rose to 9.6% in November from 8.8% in the prior month, marking one of the highest levels in decades.</p><p>Treasury yields rose modestly after the data, providing a lift to financial shares, while weighing on technology and other growth-oriented sectors. But the move in yields was hardly alarming, analysts said.</p><p>“Mixed messages continue to reign as the year winds down,” said Lindsey Bell, chief money and markets strategist at Ally Invest. “Hotter-than-anticipated PPI has upset the market, especially tech stocks, this morning. Yet, bond yields don't seem to be worried about inflation sticking around as the 10-year sits 20 basis points below pre-Thanksgiving levels.”</p><p>Investors had already expected Fed policy makers to announce a faster pace of tapering of bond purchases on Wednesday due to higher inflation, and particular attention will be paid to the Fed's latest economic projections and its interest rate expectations, laid out in the so-called dot plot.</p><p>See:&#xa0;5 things to watch for when the Federal Reserve announces its policy decision Wednesday</p><p>“Front-end interest rates are pricing just under three rate hikes in 2022 — which would seemingly reflect an expectation that tapering of asset purchases is accelerated and that Fed ‘dots' will drift higher at&#xa0;Wednesday's meeting,” said a team of Citi strategists led by Andrew Hollenhorst.</p><p>“However, equity prices at all-time highs and long-term real interest rates close to historic lows suggest the market continues to price a relatively benign scenario where inflation returns to target without significantly more restrictive monetary policy,” the analysts said in a note to clients.</p><p>Read:Fund managers dash for cash ahead of Fed decision</p><p>Investors may also want to see the Fed's view on the fast-spreading omicron variant of COVID. Facing rising infections, California became the latest state to reimpose indoor mask mandates, which take effect on Wednesday. A study released Tuesday from Discovery, South Africa's biggest health-insurance provider, showed that two shots of the Pfizer-BionTech vaccine offer 70% protection against hospitalizations.</p><p>The International Energy Agency on Wednesday cut its 2022 supply forecast from non-OPEC producers by 100,000 barrels a day and its demand forecast by the same amount, amid expectations a surge in coronavirus cases due to the omicron variant will weigh on the global recovery.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Terminix Global Holdings Inc.TMX jumped 17.2% after agreeing to be purchased by rival pest-control group Rentokil Initial PLC&#xa0;UK:RTO in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $6.7 billion.&#xa0;</p><p>Neogen Corp.NEOG were up 7.7% after the food-safety business confirmed a report by The Wall Street Journal that it is combining with a similar unit of 3M Corp.'s&#xa0;MMM,&#xa0;-1.42%&#xa0;in a deal with an enterprise value of $9.3 billion. 3M shares rose 0.1%.</p><p>Shares of Tesla Inc.TSLA slipped 3.3%, after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sold more shares.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;BX:TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;was up 1.2 basis points at 1.439%. Treasury yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a half-dozen other monetary units, was up 0.1%.</p><p>In oil futures, West Texas Intermediate crude CL00&#xa0;for January delivery&#xa0;CLF22 fell 1.8%.</p><p>Gold futures&#xa0;GC00 for February delivery GCG22 fell 0.9%.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 Index&#xa0;XX:SXXP fell 0.8%, while London's FTSE 100 Index&#xa0;UK:UKX lost 0.2%.</p><p>In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index&#xa0;CN:SHCOMP fell 0.5%, while the Hang Seng Index&#xa0;HK:HSI fell 1.3%in Hong Kong.
