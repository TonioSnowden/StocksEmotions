  "title": "Do We Need N95 Masks to Protect Against Omicron? Cloth masks may not offer enough protection against fast-spreading variant. Here's what you need to know about stronger options.",
  "text": "<p>What is an N95 mask?</p><p>N95 masks which are certified by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have a denser network of fibers than surgical or cloth masks. That tighter mesh, together with an electrostatic charge in the material, generally makes such masks the most efficient at trapping larger droplets and aerosols that are exhaled by the wearer. They also better block such particles from being inhaled.</p><p>Properly fitted, certified N95 masks can filter up to 95% of particles in the air.</p><p>What is the latest guidance surrounding mask wearing?</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance recommends that people wear masks, including cloth ones that are multilayered and tightly woven, that fit snugly and have an adjustable wire nose bridge. It also suggests layering masks, using a disposable mask underneath a cloth mask.</p><p>The agency recommends that specially labeled \"surgical\" N95 respirators should be prioritized for healthcare personnel, but also says that in some situations \"when supplies are available, individuals may choose to use a basic disposable N95 respirator for personal use.\"</p><p>Many professionals in the field say certain masks are more effective than others in protecting people from the Omicron variant and that cloth masks alone aren't. If you can't get an N95, doctors suggest KN95, KF94 and FFP2 masks, which are certified in China, South Korea and Europe, respectively.</p><p>What is the difference between an N95 and a KN95?</p><p>N95 masks are certified in the U.S., while KN95s are certified in China. The CDC warns that many KN95s in the U.S. are counterfeit and don't meet NIOSH requirements.</p><p>Do N95 masks protect others?</p><p>Studies have found that N95 masks help protect the wearers as well as people around them from the virus that causes Covid-19.</p><p>Why aren't cloth masks as effective?</p><p>Single-layer cloth masks, which many people prefer for comfort and style, can block larger droplets carrying the virus, but aren't as effective in blocking smaller aerosols or particles carrying the virus, according to infectious-disease specialists.</p><p>What about surgical masks?</p><p>Surgical masks are made of polypropylene, which has electrostatic charge characteristics that can block the virus. The drawback of surgical masks is that they often fit poorly, creating gaps that can allow particles to pass through.</p><p>Should I wear a cloth or surgical mask over an N95 for extra protection?</p><p>Doctors have recommended wearing cloth masks over surgical masks to create a snugger fit. A second mask isn't necessary when wearing an N95, although some scientists have said it could help protect the N95's material. 3M, which makes N95s, doesn't recommend putting an additional mask over an N95 and warns that putting anything over them can change the fit or breathability.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Clare Ansberry at clare.ansberry@wsj.com, Nidhi Subbaraman at nidhi.subbaraman@wsj.com and Sumathi Reddy at Sumathi.Reddy@wsj.com</p><p>Do We Need N95 Masks to Protect Against Omicron?</p>",
