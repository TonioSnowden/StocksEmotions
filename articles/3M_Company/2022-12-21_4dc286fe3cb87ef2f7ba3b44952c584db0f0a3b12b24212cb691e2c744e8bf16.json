  "text": "<p>3M cited accelerating regulatory focus on eliminating the chemicals and \"changing stakeholder expectations\" in making its decision. The company said it has already reduced its use of the substances over the past three years.</p><p>What are PFAS or 'forever chemicals'?</p><p>PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a set of thousands of chemicals that were first produced in the 1940s and then widely used for decades in products such as nonstick cookware, waterproof jackets and firefighting foam.</p><p>The chemicals were prized by manufacturers and consumers for their ability to resist heat, stains and grease.</p><p>Since the chemicals break down slowly and have been found in the environment as well as the blood of people and animals around the world, the EPA moved to eliminate the use of two forms of PFAS more than a decade ago and it now plans to limit those chemicals in public drinking water, among other regulatory actions.</p><p>People can be exposed to PFAS in a variety of ways, according to the EPA. Those include drinking water, eating foods or breathing air that has been contaminated with the chemicals.</p><p>Are the chemicals dangerous to your health?</p><p>According to the EPA, exposure to high levels of certain PFAS may lead to increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased cholesterol levels and risk of obesity, among other things.</p><p>Scientists are continuing to study the health effects of PFAS, and the EPA has said the risks are difficult to determine because people can be exposed to the chemicals in a variety of ways. The agency has said there are thousands of chemicals with varying effects and most studies have only focused on a limited number of PFAS.</p><p>The two PFAS chemicals that were most commonly used and studied for their potential health effects are known as PFOA and PFOS. Companies stopped manufacturing both chemicals beginning in the early 2000s, and the chemical industry has disputed some health findings by the EPA.</p><p>What U.S. states have issues with 'forever chemicals'?</p><p>PFAS have been found across the country in groundwater and surface water. In 2018, the state of Minnesota reached a settlement with 3M for $850 million after alleging that the company damaged drinking water and natural resources in the Twin Cities area.</p><p>Other states have filed lawsuits against PFAS manufacturers over alleged contamination and many are increasing regulations on the chemicals. About seven states, including Maine, Vermont, New Jersey and Michigan have set limits for certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water. Other states have proposed limits for them in drinking water and taking other steps, such as providing aid to farmers whose animals and crops have been tainted by the chemicals.</p><p>Some states are also moving to ban PFAS in products. Since 2020, California has passed laws banning PFAS in cosmetics, firefighting foam and food wrappers, among other products.</p><p>How common are PFAS in drinking water?</p><p>The first systematic testing for PFAS in drinking water under an EPA program between 2013 and 2015 looked for six PFAS chemicals and found the chemicals in public drinking water systems serving an estimated six million people.</p><p>The EPA has ordered a new round of testing that will begin in 2023 to look for 29 PFAS chemicals in public drinking water systems.</p><p>What products contain PFAS today?</p><p>3M, DuPont and other manufacturers stopped producing PFOA and PFOS through agreements with the EPA beginning in the early 2000s. Other forms of PFAS continue to be used in an array of products from cellphones and semiconductors to clothing, cosmetics, textiles and food packaging.</p><p>A major area of concern involves firefighting foam that contained PFAS that has seeped into some drinking water supplies near military sites, airports and training facilities where the foam was used for years.</p><p>What is the role of the EPA in regulating PFAS?</p><p>The EPA has laid out a road map for regulating PFAS on a number of fronts to protect public health.</p><p>The EPA plans to propose the first federal limits on PFOA and PFOS in drinking water and has said the regulations could be completed in 2023. The move would require public drinking water systems to ensure that the two chemicals are below limits set by the agency for the first time. The limits would supersede any state regulations that had set higher limits for the chemicals.</p><p>In August 2022, the agency proposed designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the federal Superfund law, a move that would give the agency more authority to require companies to clean up contaminated sites.</p><p>In June 2022, the agency sharply lowered safe-consumption levels for PFOA and PFOS, a shift it said was in light of newly available science. The new lifetime health advisories aren't enforceable limits but are intended to provide guidance for state officials and others as they develop policies to protect the public from the chemicals.</p><p>This explanatory article may be periodically updated.</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at Kris.Maher@wsj.com</p><p>What Are 'Forever Chemicals' and Are They Hazardous to Your Health?</p>",
