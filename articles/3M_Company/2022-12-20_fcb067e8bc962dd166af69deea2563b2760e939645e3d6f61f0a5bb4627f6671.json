  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 11 points, or 0.3%, to 3,829.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 145 points, or 0.4%, at 32,903.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 10,564.</p><p>Stocks fell for a fourth straight session on Monday.The Nasdaq Composite was down 6.3% over that stretch, and has retreated 32.6% so far this year.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Wall Street was looking to avoid a fifth straight losing session, while investors weighed the implications of a surprise monetary policy shiftby the Bank of Japan.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 closed the previous day near a six-week low as concerns intensify that central banks' hiking of borrowing costs to combat inflation will push economies into recession and cause corporate earnings to fall.</p><p>The Bank of Japan had been an outlier among major central banks by having maintained rates at the zero lower bound, while others embarked on their biggest tightening cycle in a generation, noted Henry Allen, strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>But on Tuesday the BoJ doubled the cap on the country's 10-year bond BX:TMBMKJP-10Y, from 0.25% to 0.5%, causing the yen to jump more than 3%, while whacking equities in the region and giving U.S. stock investors more to consider. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a gauge of the dollar's strength against a basket of rivals, down by 0.8% to 103.86.</p><p>See: Why the Bank of Japan's surprise policy twist is rattling global markets</p><p>The BoJ kept its short-term interest rate at minus 0.1%, but the raising of the yield at which it will allow bonds to trade was seen as a step toward the ending of its era of ultraloose monetary policy. The Nikkei 225 JP:NIK fell 2.5%.</p><p>\"That was like the last holdout on global yields and really the last anchoring of global yields. So to see that [cap on its 10-year bond] moves up, even though they [BoJ] are specifically saying this is not a rate hike, they're trying to improve market functioning,\" said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist, Crossmark Global Investments, via phone.</p><p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose to 3.694% as the equivalent maturity Japanese government bond BX:TMBMKJP-10Y climbed to 0.418%.</p><p>However, some analysts argued that recent drops in U.S. stocks were starting to go too far.</p><p>\"I think we've been oversold the last couple weeks,\" Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading, said in a phone interview. There's the macroeconomic pressures weighing on stocks, but Saluzzi said the recent run of heavy selling may also be partly attributable to year-end tax-loss harvesting to reap tax benefits from the year's losses.</p><p>The Bank of Japan announcement may have unsettled some early trading, he said. But ultimately, there's just one central bank in the mind of U.S. equity investors, Saluzzi noted.</p><p>Until the Federal Reserve is clear that its own interest rate hikes are complete, markets will be choppy, Saluzzi said. \"The economy is weakening. No matter what the Fed said, they are not going to be doing much more,\" he said.</p><p>See: BofA clients bought equities again last week, driving biggest ETF inflows since 2017 in sinking stock market</p><p>Strategists at Citi said they do not expect a year-end rally this year as the returns for the S&amp;P 500 are now below their levels at the end of October, when investors saw a rally in the U.S. equities starting from mid-October.</p><p>\"Going into the end of the year, seasonal effects for November and December are much stronger when returns are positive through October – in 2022 they were not,\" wrote strategists led by Alex Saunders in a Monday note. \"We did not see a lasting November/December rally this year so far, as Santa Claus effects are much more muted in down years.\"</p><p>See: Are stocks cheap enough to buy? BlackRock says they are after a brutal 2022</p><p>Tuesday morning data gave another window to a slowing economy. Construction on new U.S. homesfell a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in November to 1.43 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. However, building permits for new homes fell 11.2% to 1.34 million in November.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* 3M Co. MMM isphasing out the manufacturing of so-called \"forever chemicals\" like fluoropolymers, fluorinated fluids, and PFAS-based additive products by the end of 2025. The phaseout process will include taking mostly noncash charges of $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion to exit from the line of business. Shares were down 0.4% in afternoon trading.</p><p>* Wells Fargo &amp; Co. WFC was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1.7 billion and return more than $2 billion to consumers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The regulator said the fines and consumer redress are connected to \"widespread mismanagement\" of auto loans, mortgages and deposit accounts, the CFPB said. Shares were off 1.8% on Tuesday.</p><p>* Shares of Newmont Corporation NEM jumped 4.8% after gold prices settled at their highest levels in a week on Tuesday. The gold miner's stock is down nearly 23% year to date.</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow rises nearly 150 points in final hour of trade as stocks attempt to bounce after Bank of Japan policy surprise adds to jitters</p>",
