  "title": "Tuesday's Markets:  S&P Drops From Record Level  ----  By Joe Wallace and Michael Wursthorn",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks edged away from record territory as investors sold shares of technology and communications stocks and Treasury yields climbed. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 ended the day in the red for the first time in three sessions, halting the stock market's steady grind higher. </p><p>    Tesla shares weighed on the broad index after investors' underwhelming response to the electric-car maker's latest quarterly report, underscoring the high bar the market has set for stocks this earnings season. </p><p>   Shares of other big tech companies followed Tesla lower, while investors also contended with a third straight day of rising bond yields, bringing the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury to 1.622%. </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite fell 48.56 points, or 0.3%, to 14090.22 a day after closing at a record. The S&amp;P 500 also pulled back from record levels, falling 0.9 point, or less than 0.1%, to 4186.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average barely budged, closing up 3.36 points, or less than 0.1%, to 33984.93. </p><p>   About 30% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported results so far, with nearly 88% topping analysts' expectations, according to FactSet. But just 57% of reporting companies have seen their stock prices rise in the wake of their reports. </p><p>   Investors appear cautious, money managers said, pointing to risks stemming from elevated valuations, the potential for a jump in inflation and the raging epidemic in India. </p><p>   \"We've got a big week of tech earnings where valuations are probably a bit more stretched than in other areas,\" said Stuart Rumble, investment director at Fidelity International. </p><p>   In after-hours trading, Microsoft shares fell after topping Wall Street's profit forecasts, shedding more than 3%. Alphabet's report was better received by investors after it broke sales records for the first quarter, sending shares up nearly 4% posttrading. </p><p>   Among the biggest movers in the regular session, shares of Tesla, which reported a record profit, fell $33.46, or 4.5%, to $704.74. </p><p>   The electric-car maker's stock has struggled this year, rising just 0.1% since the end of December, amid a series of challenges including an investigation into a crash of a Model S sedan this month in Texas. The stock remains up more than 300% over the past 12 months. </p><p>   General Electric slipped 8 cents, or 0.6%, to $13.49 after the company's jet-engine business and divestitures weighed on its quarterly results. </p><p>   Profit shrank at Eli Lilly, pulling shares down $5.01, or 2.7%, to $182.21. And 3M shares fell $5.18, or 2.6%, to $194.45, despite reporting better-than-expected earnings. </p><p>   Delivery companies were among the S&amp;P 500's best performers, with United Parcel Service shares jumping $18.32, or 10%, to $194.13 after the shipping company topped forecasts for profit and revenue. FedEx, which reported earnings last month, rose $11.75, or 4.3%, to $287.51. </p><p>   Some investors say stocks face a bumpy ride in the coming months, pointing to signs of excess in cryptocurrencies and other corners of financial markets. </p><p>   \"It may make sense to take a couple of chips off the table,\" said Daniel Egger, chief investment officer at St. Gotthard Fund Management. </p><p>   Surveys showing that individual investors are extremely bullish suggest stocks are vulnerable to a pullback, according to Mr. Egger. </p><p>   On Wednesday, investors will closely watch Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference once the central bank wraps up its latest policy meeting. </p><p>   Investors will be looking for clues around whether the Fed's thinking on interest rates has changed in light of recent economic data, some of which suggests inflation is reappearing. </p><p>   Overseas, Europe's Stoxx 600 fell 0.1%. Early Wednesday in Asia, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.3%, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2% and South Korea's Kospi was down 0.9%. S&amp;P futures were up 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
