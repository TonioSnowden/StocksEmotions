  "text": "<p>Investors cheered earnings from large financial firms, sending stocks in recent days after months of falling on fears of rising interest rates and soaring inflation.</p><p>\"We are seeing better-than-feared earnings reports, and Treasury yields are pulling back—both are positives for the stock market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial Inc.</p><p>Data released Tuesday morning showed home-price growth slowed sharply, sending bond yields tumbling.</p><p>The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note slid to 4.108% from 4.231% on Monday as bond prices rose, according to Tradeweb. Monday's yield was its highest closing level since 2008. The two-year yield, which is closely tied to central bank policy expectations, edged lower to 4.475% from 4.498%, retracing a larger move immediately following the housing print.</p><p>Falling long-term yields propelled segments of the stock market most sensitive to interest rates. Shares of utilities and real estate firms—that offer high dividends and sometimes compete with bond yields—gained 1.7% and 3.4% as of early Tuesday afternoon, respectively.</p><p>\"This is a pretty broad-based rally, but clearly the leadership is in rate-sensitive sectors,\" added Mr. Hogan.</p><p>Growth segments of the market also saw gains, as investors place more value on those companies' future earnings when interest rates are lower. Technology and consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Nearly all of the S&amp;P 500 11 sectors were in the green, save shares of energy firms.</p><p>Higher mortgage rates crimped housing demand, denting red-hot home price inflation that has buoyed headline inflation measures.</p><p>Stocks turned higher following the data release because some investors saw the drop in demand as a sign that the Fed's monetary tightening is reining in inflation.</p><p>Hopes—and bets—are building that the Federal Reserve could be approaching a point at where the central bank feels comfortable easing the pace of interest rate increases.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point next week, but are also expected to debate a smaller increase toward the end of the year, offering investors hope that the worst could be behind them.</p><p>A slow down in the pace of rate-increases would not necessarily be indicative of a shift towards easy monetary policy, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>\"It would be very dangerous for the market to assume a 0.50-point rate-increase at the Fed's December meeting is a 'pivot,'\" said Ms. Krosby, citing the Fed's speed in raising rates and \"the lagged effect of rate increases that have yet to be felt in the economy.\"</p><p>Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Spotify are set to report results after markets close, setting the tone for a week of tech earnings with Apple, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Amazon.com due to report later in the week.</p><p>The megacap technology firms set to report earnings could offer a barometer for U.S. corporate health, especially with the future guidance they offer, Ms. Krosby said. Higher interest rates that proved to be a boon for bank earnings may have the opposite effect on rate-sensitive tech firms.</p><p>\"We may have seen both inflation and fears of Federal Reserve tightening peak in recent weeks,\" said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers. \"If regime change is a three-legged stool, the next component needed for a reversal in market-fortunes is corporate earnings.\"</p><p>Mr. Edwards said he is keenly focused on whether revenues remain robust and how resilient margins and corporate guidance will be, especially given uncertainty around the strong dollar's negative impact on profits earned abroad and economic drags associated with higher interest rates.</p><p>Shares of General Electric slipped 1.2% as it outlined plans to cut costs. General Motors rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that were ahead of forecasts. 3M shares fell 0.4% after the sticky-note maker reported lower sales. United Parcel Service rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that beat forecasts but later lost much of those gains, rising just 0.3% on the day.</p><p>U.S. listed Chinese stocks indexes are recovering some of Monday's record losses after President Xi Jinping's political-shakeup to kick off his third term. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 4% in Tuesday trading following a 14% drop on Monday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 0.6% to $91.78 a barrel.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 was an outperformer in Asia, rising 1%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.4%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise Amid Earnings Stampede, Hopes for Easier Fed Policy</p>",
