  "title": "3M's Earplug Business Files for Chapter 11; Aearo Technologies unit faces claims of hearing damage from military veterans over alleged defects",
  "text": "<p>Separately, the company said it would create a new company from its healthcare businesses, putting it on a path followed by other industrial conglomerates in recent years, including General Electric Co., of creating separate companies for business lines with the potential for better sales and profit growth by themselves.</p><p>3M executives had argued for years that the company's diverse portfolio of hundreds of businesses and thousands of products benefited from shared research and development and the use of common materials, such as adhesives.</p><p>3M shareholders will receive shares in the new company. The health business lines had sales of about $8.6 billion in 2021, the company said. The company will include 3M's products for wound care, oral care, healthcare information technology and biopharma filtration, 3M said.</p><p>3M, based in St. Paul, Minn., expects to retain a 19.9% stake in the new company and said the stake will be monetized over time. The company expects to complete the spinoff by the end of 2023.</p><p>The maker of Scotch tape and Post-it Notes on Tuesday reported a drop in second-quarter revenue and profit and cut its full-year sales and earnings outlook as it grapples with a stronger dollar and uncertain economic environment that affects consumer and industrial spending patterns.</p><p>Shares rose 4.2% in premarket trading.</p><p>More than 100,000 U.S. military veterans have filed lawsuits against 3M overhearing damage linked to what they claim are defects in the company's military-grade earplugs.</p><p>3M bought Aearo Technologies for $1.2 billion in 2008.</p><p>3M and Aearo Technologies have said the earplugs were effective and safe when they were used properly. The company plans to use the bankruptcy process to cap its liability and reduce the time and cost needed to litigate thousands of cases separately. The strategy has been used by other companies, particularly those that had exposure to yearslong litigation related to asbestos.</p><p>The charges tied to the earplug litigation weighed on 3M's quarterly results. Earnings for the period ended June 30 plunged to $78 million, or 14 cents a share, from $1.52 billion, or $2.59 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>3M also booked various charges in the quarter tied to its allegedly defective military ear plugs as well as suits related to the production of \"forever chemicals.\" The company said it is taking a per-share charge of 51 cents to remediate contaminations from chemicals at and around a plant in Belgium as well as a 17-cents charge on other significant litigation.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, 3M said adjusted earnings were $2.48 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected adjusted earnings of $2.41 a share.</p><p>Overall for the second quarter, 3M's sales fell 3% to $8.7 billion. Stripping out the effects of currency translations, organic sales rose 1%. 3M said sales faced a 4-percentage-point headwind from the combined impact of Covid-19 related restrictions in China as well as a decline in disposable respirator demand. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for $8.57 billion.</p><p>3M trimmed its outlook for the year and now expects 2022 sales to fall by between 2.5% and 0.5%. 3M previously forecast 2022 sales growth of 1% to 4%.</p><p>The company lowered its per-share earnings outlook to between $10.30 and $10.80 for the year, down from $10.75 to $11.25.</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com and Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>3M's Earplug Business Files for Chapter 11</p>",
