  "text": "<p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 rose 96 points, or 0.3%, to 35716</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500 ES00 gained 0.4%, or 18 points, to 4576</p><p>Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00 rose 0.7%, or 101 points, to 15596</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 64 points, or 0.18%, to 35741, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 22 points, or 0.47%, to 4566, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 137 points, or 0.9%, to 15227. Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 ended at record highs, with the Nasdaq Composite just 1% away from a new high.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has advanced for eight of the last nine sessions as third-quarter earnings have largely topped expectations. But strategists at Deutsche Bank are starting to notice a trend.</p><p>“Even though this has been a good earnings season in aggregate we are starting to see more companies with supply backlogs, hiring difficulties, and rising input prices that are eating into profits. Indeed yesterday saw a few consumer staples companies lower full year profit outlooks in their earnings releases,” said strategists led by Jim Reid.</p><p>Tuesday's earnings wave includes General Electric GE, 3M MMM, and after the close, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT. Social-media giant Facebook FB edged higher in premarket trade after it surpassed third-quarter earnings estimates but issued a revenue outlook below Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Overnight, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held their second call in four months. The economics calendar includes home price, new-home sales and consumer confidence data.</p>",
