  "title": "Kirkland Wins Court Approval to Advise 3M Earplug Unit Bankruptcy; A bankruptcy judge said 3M and its Aearo unit's interests are aligned and Kirkland's representation in both doesn't cause a conflict",
  "text": "<p>Judge Graham said he believed the goals for 3M and its bankrupt unit Aearo are aligned at this point because they both aim to resolve valid injury claims.</p><p>\"This is not an easy call because of the myriad of factors,\" Judge Graham said. \"But ultimately, I do believe that Kirkland Ellis is disinterested and not adverse based upon the unique facts of this case.\"</p><p>3M placed Aearo, the earplug manufacturing unit, under chapter 11 protection in July to shift the injury lawsuits to bankruptcy court. The strategy hasn't worked out as planned so far as Judge Graham declined to extend Aearo's litigation shield to 3M, and the mass lawsuits are continuing against 3M in federal court in Pensacola, Fla.</p><p>During the court hearing Wednesday, lawyers representing the earplug injury claimants said Kirkland can't be loyal to Aearo as its bankruptcy counsel because Kirkland lawyers pushed Aearo into chapter 11 for the sole purpose of managing 3M's litigation risks.</p><p>\"It was an offshoot of the combat arms litigation that they got paid $173 million,\" said Robert Pfister, one of the lawyers representing injury claimants, noting that Kirkland conceived the bankruptcy plan while representing 3M for the mass injury litigation, for which it received $173 million in fees.</p><p>The U.S. Trustee said Kirkland's duty as 3M's litigation counsel is to minimize the parent company's liabilities. Its role in Aearo conflicts with that because Aearo's bankruptcy case depends on 3M's commitment to provide unlimited funding toward resolving the earplug litigation in return for a full release from liability, and as counsel to Aearo, Kirkland has a fiduciary duty to maximize 3M's contribution.</p><p>Mark McKane, litigator at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, disagreed and said that Kirkland is \"uniquely qualified\" to represent Aearo in the bankruptcy case because it has been advising not only 3M but also Aearo in the mass earplug lawsuits. The interests of Aearo and 3M have been aligned in this matter because they both deny liability and seek to settle or resolve it.</p><p>In addition, to address potential conflict, Aearo's independent directors have been represented by a separate law firm. The effectiveness of the structure is apparent in the funding agreement, which even injury lawyers see as advantageous to the claimants.</p><p>\"The funding agreement is a â€˜pretty darn good deal,' and those aren't my words. Those are Mr. Pfister's words,\" Mr. McKane said.</p><p>Write to Akiko Matsuda at akiko.matsuda@wsj.com</p>",
