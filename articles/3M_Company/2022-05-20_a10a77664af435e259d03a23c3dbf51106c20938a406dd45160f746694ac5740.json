  "title": "Federal Jury Says 3M Must Pay $77.5 Million to Army Veteran in Latest Earplugs Case; James Beal's lawsuit alleged that the company's earplugs caused hearing loss, ringing in the ears",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court in Pensacola, Fla.</p><p>The green and yellow earplugs were designed to block noise if inserted in one direction. When inserted in the other direction, they were designed to let in nearby voices but still shield the ear from harmful noises.</p><p>Mr. Beal served in the army from 2005 to 2009, his lawyers said, and was in the army reserves until 2011. He was exposed to noise from weapons while training and in combat, the lawyers said. He currently has hearing loss and ringing in his ears, according to his lawyers.</p><p>3M has stood by the safety of the earplugs. The company said in a statement Friday that it was disappointed in the verdict and will appeal it.</p><p>\"We disagree with the punitive damages awarded in this case,\" the company said. \"3M's conduct with respect to the CAEv2 product was consistent with the company's values and longtime commitment to keeping our U.S. military safe.\"</p><p>Mr. Beal's lawyers—Bryan Aylstock, Shelley Hutson and Christopher Seeger—said in a statement that nearly $300 million has been awarded to service members.</p><p>\"It is clear 3M's defenses—whether in the courts, to investors, or the public—are unconvincing and without merit,\" the lawyers said.</p><p>The service members allege that 3M knew for years that the earplugs had a tendency to come loose and let in more sound than specified. They also say that 3M didn't give the military adequate instructions on how to use the earplugs.</p><p>In the company's recent quarterly results, 3M cited the lawsuits as part of the company's litigation costs that have weighed on its overall results. The company said last month it will start to adjust earnings to reflect costs tied to litigation.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Federal Jury Says 3M Must Pay $77.5 Million to Army Veteran in Latest Earplugs Case</p>",
