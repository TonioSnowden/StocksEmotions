  "text": "<p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 fell 0.2% to 4,651</p><p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 were flat at 35,546</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 dropped 0.4% to 16,008</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Industrials DJIA fell by 320.04 points, or 0.9%, at 35,650.95, the lowest closing value since Dec. 6, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP also lost ground.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Monday marked the biggest one-day point and percentage falls since Dec. 1 for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow, as investors fretted over the fast spreading omicron variant of COVID and looked ahead to the kickoff of the last Fed meeting of the year.</p><p>Investors expect policy makers to announce a faster pace of tapering at the meeting's conclusion on Wednesday due to higher inflation, with particular attention on the Fed's latest economic projections and its rate expectations, laid out in the so-called dot plot.</p><p>See:&#xa0;5 things to watch for when the Federal Reserve announces its policy decision Wednesday</p><p>“Front-end interest rates are pricing just under three rate hikes in 2022 — which would seemingly reflect an expectation that tapering of asset purchases is accelerated and that Fed ‘dots' will drift higher at&#xa0;Wednesday's meeting,” said a team of Citi strategists led by Andrew Hollenhorst.</p><p>“However, equity prices at all-time highs and long-term real interest rates close to historic lows suggest the market continues to price a relatively benign scenario where inflation returns to target without significantly more restrictive monetary policy,” the strategists said in a note to clients.</p><p>Read:Fund managers dash for cash ahead of Fed decision</p><p>Investors will get an update on producer price inflation, with November data due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Ahead of that, a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business reported a slight increase in small-business owners sentiment.</p><p>Investors may also want to see the Fed's viewpoint on the fast-spreading omicron variant of COVID. Facing rising infections, California became the latest state to reimpose indoor mask mandates, which take effect on Wednesday. A study released Tuesday from Discovery, South Africa's biggest health-insurance provider, showed that two shots of the Pfizer-BionTech vaccine offer 70% protection against hospitalizations, Bloomberg reported.</p><p>“The question this week is whether central banks perceive inflation or omicron to be the greater risk. The consensus view still appears to be that price pressures are driven by temporary factors that will largely correct over time but every month of inaction is a risk,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.</p><p>The International Energy Agency on Wednesday cut its 2022 supply forecast from non-OPEC producers by 100,000 barrels a day and its demand forecast by the same amount, amid expectations a surge in coronavirus cases due to the omicron variant will weigh on the global recovery.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Terminix Global Holdings Inc.TMX jumped 24% in premarket trade after agreeing to be purchased by rival pest-control group Rentokil Initial PLC&#xa0;UK:RTO in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $6.7 billion.&#xa0;</p><p>Neogen Corp.NEOG soared 14% after the food-safety business confirmed a report by The Wall Street Journal that it is combining with a similar unit of 3M Corp.'s&#xa0;MMM,&#xa0;-1.42%&#xa0;in a deal with an enterprise value of $9.3 billion.</p><p>Shares of Tesla Inc.TSLA slipped 2% in premarket trading, after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sold more shares.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;BX:TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;rose 1 basis point to 1.436%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Treasury yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a half-dozen other monetary units, fell 0.1%.</p><p>In oil futures, West Texas Intermediate crude CL00&#xa0;for January delivery&#xa0;CLF22 rose 4 cents to $71.36 a barrel.</p><p>Gold futures&#xa0;GC00 for February delivery GCG22 fell 0.2% to $1,784.90 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 Index&#xa0;XX:SXXP was unchanged, while London's FTSE 100 Index&#xa0;UK:UKX was up 0.3%.</p><p>In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index&#xa0;CN:SHCOMP fell 0.5%, while the Hang Seng Index&#xa0;HK:HSI fell 1.3%in Hong Kong.
