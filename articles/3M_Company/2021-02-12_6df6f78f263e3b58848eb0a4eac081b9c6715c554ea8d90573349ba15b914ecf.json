  "title": "Counterfeit  N95 Masks  Seized From  Warehouse  ----  By Deanna Paul",
  "text": "<p>   New York City authorities raided a Long Island City warehouse that they said held 1.7 million counterfeit N95 masks, marking one of the biggest single seizures of personal protective equipment since the pandemic began. </p><p>   The Queens County District Attorney's Office, which spearheaded the investigation, charged Zhi Zeng, the warehouse manager, with felony trademark counterfeiting on Wednesday. If convicted, the 33-year-old Brooklyn man faces up to 15 years in prison. Other individuals are under investigation. </p><p>   Authorities said the warehouse was \"an elaborate production assembly line\" for the counterfeit masks. They also found hundreds of thousands of pieces of other personal protective equipment in the warehouse. </p><p>   \"We are living in a horrible pandemic with more than 450,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. This defendant allegedly sold false hope and security and was set to sell more of these counterfeit masks,\" said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz. </p><p>   Acting on a tip, law enforcement raided the two-story warehouse in Long Island City this week, and discovered more than 100 pallets \"piled high with boxes of 3M-labeled N95 masks,\" according to the district attorney's office. Mr. Zeng, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday, was present at the time. </p><p>   3M Co. is a manufacturer of N95 masks, which have emerged as critical protective tools for healthcare workers. A 3M spokeswoman said the company assisted the Queens prosecutors' probe and has launched a global effort to fight fraud. </p><p>   The Queens District Attorney's Office is working to identify anyone who may have purchased or used the counterfeit masks that were already distributed. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Austen Hufford contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
