  "text": "<p>   Corporate giants from Apple Inc. to Visa Inc. are expected to report financial results over the coming week, giving investors insight into the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delta variant and increased business costs. </p><p>   In all, 180 members of the S&amp;P 500 are to provide quarterly updates starting Monday, including the world's biggest tech companies. The list also includes restaurant companies McDonald's Corp. and Starbucks Corp., industrial firms such as 3M Co., Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., as well as Ford Motor Co. and energy heavyweights Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. </p><p>   Companies are on track to report strong year-over-year gains in revenue and profit, as they benefit from the reopening of economies this spring. </p><p>   Still, many already reporting have talked about the need to raise prices for products from metal fasteners to Oreo cookies to offset rising costs for materials, transportation and workers. </p><p>   Electric-car manufacturer Tesla Inc. helps kick off the week Monday. The company in April reported record earnings, and Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors then that \"demand is the best we've ever seen.\" Wall Street, according to FactSet, is expecting Tesla's sales to be $11.53 billion for the second quarter, nearly double the company's $6.04 billion in sales in the year-ago second quarter. </p><p>   On Tuesday, Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. report after the closing bell. Apple in its March quarter saw profit more than double on revenue that rose more than half. For the June quarter, analysts expect sales of $73.3 billion, lower than the $89.58 billion in March but higher than the year-ago results. </p><p>   Microsoft's sales for its fourth quarter ended in June are expected to increase 16% from a year earlier to $44.13 billion, which would represent its highest quarter ever, according to FactSet. The company has seen strong growth in its cloud and game offerings. </p><p>   Alphabet, parent of Google, and Facebook Inc. have benefited from an increase in spending for online ads, and better-than-expected results from Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. on Thursday suggest those numbers could remain strong. </p><p>    Amazon.com Inc. is to report second-quarter results Thursday, and analysts expect sales to rise to $115.34 billion, its third straight quarter above $100 billion in sales. </p><p></p>",
