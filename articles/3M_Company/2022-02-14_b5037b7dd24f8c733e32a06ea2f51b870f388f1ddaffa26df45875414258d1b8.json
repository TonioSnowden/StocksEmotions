  "text": "<p>\"Governors removing mask mandates just means that the government is no longer requiring masks. It does not mean that there is now no risk to going around maskless,\" said Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public-health professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Here's what to know about state updates to mask mandates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance, and what you should take into consideration as you weigh whether or not to mask up.</p><p>Which states have shifted mask mandates recently?</p><p>Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, Delaware and California are among the states easing restrictions around masking as the Omicron surge subsides. California's indoor mask mandate will expire on Feb. 15, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. Oregon's requirements will end by March 31 and Delaware's mandate lapsed on Feb. 11.</p><p>New York dropped its indoor mask mandate for businesses effective Feb. 10, but the mandate for schools will stay in place for now, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The change won't affect the New York City rule that requires vaccination to enter restaurants, theaters and other public spaces.</p><p>As states relax restrictions, 3M, America's largest manufacturer of respirators, said Monday that it expects the easing pandemic to reduce demand for medical masks this year.</p><p>Does this mean there are no local mask mandates in effect in those states?</p><p>Not necessarily. School districts in Connecticut and New Jersey will be able to determine their own masking policies starting Feb. 28 and March 7, respectively, governors of those states said. In New York, masks will still be required in healthcare settings and on public transportation. Los Angeles County will keep its indoor mask mandate in place for at least a few more weeks despite California's decision to curb its statewide mandate. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak encouraged employers and organizations, including school districts, to set their own mask policies.</p><p>What is the latest CDC guidance?</p><p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the agency recommends people wear masks in public indoor settings where transmission of Covid-19 is substantial or high. CDC data show that is the case across the U.S., even as reported new infections have fallen from the winter's Omicron-driven peak. The CDC has also recommended universal masking in K-12 schools regardless of vaccination status.</p><p>\"We certainly understand the need and desire to be flexible,\" Dr. Walensky said. But \"we are not there yet,\" she said of doing away with masking recommendations.</p><p>The CDC also continues to recommend that anyone who is immunocompromised, unvaccinated or not up to date on vaccines should wear masks in indoor public spaces.</p><p>Should I still consider wearing a mask if there is no mandate?</p><p>Yes, especially in certain circumstances. Dr. Wen suggests taking three factors into consideration: the medical risks within your household, your own tolerance of contracting Covid-19, and the potential value of not wearing a mask.</p><p>For example, people who are unvaccinated, immunocompromised, or are planning to see immunocompromised loved ones, or who aren't bothered by wearing a mask may want to continue to do so in public indoor spaces, said Dr. Wen. (Outdoor masking, she said, is generally not necessary.)</p><p>\"I am going to continue wearing masks in indoor crowded spaces because I have two little children who are too young to be vaccinated. For me, wearing a mask is not an inconvenience,\" said Dr. Wen.</p><p>Now is a good time for people to take stock of their personal risks and medical vulnerabilities, adds Lucy McBride, a Washington, D.C., primary-care physician. Her patients who are immunocompromised may take different measures to protect themselves, she said.</p><p>The best thing people can do to mitigate their own risk and the spread of Covid-19 is to get vaccinated and boosted, according to the physicians. \"Masking is a tool in the tool kit, but there is no substitute for vaccination and boosting,\" said Dr. McBride.</p><p>What kind of mask should I wear?</p><p>Physicians say cloth face masks may not provide enough protection against the virus. They recommend pairing cloth masks with surgical models or using high-filtration masks. The CDC says cloth masks provide less protection than surgical masks, KN95s and NIOSH-approved respirators, including N95s.</p><p>It is important to select a mask that fits snugly over your nose, mouth and chin, the CDC says. If you do opt for a cloth mask, ensure that it fits snugly and doesn't leak air.</p><p>States Ease Mask Mandates, but Should You Still Wear a Mask?</p>",
