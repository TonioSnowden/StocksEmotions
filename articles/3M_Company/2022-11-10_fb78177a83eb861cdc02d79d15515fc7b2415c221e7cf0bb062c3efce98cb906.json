  "title": "California Sues 3M and DuPont Over PFAS Chemicals; The suit alleges manufacturers of 'forever chemicals' knew for decades they were harmful to humans and the environment",
  "text": "<p>3M said in a statement that it \"acted responsibly in connection with products containing PFAS and will defend its record of environmental stewardship.\"</p><p>A representative for DuPont didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>More than half a dozen other states have filed similar lawsuits against PFAS manufacturers.</p><p>In response to litigation and increasing regulations around PFAS, 3M has previously said that it is committed to environmental stewardship and to appropriate remediation at locations where the company produced or disposed of the chemicals.</p><p>A statement on DuPont's website says the company's present use of PFAS is limited, that it has systems, processes and protocols in place to ensure the chemicals are used safely, and that it is actively pursuing research into alternatives.</p><p>The California suit focuses on seven PFAS chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS, which the complaint says have been detected in the blood of 99% of state residents tested, in addition to lakes and rivers, drinking water sources, fish and wildlife.</p><p>A yearslong investigation shows the manufacturers knowingly violated state consumer protection and environmental laws, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said.</p><p>\"The scale of the devastating public nuisance created by Defendants' egregious misconduct is truly staggering,\" the complaint says. \"Unless drastic actions are taken soon, California will be dealing with the consequences of this misconduct for many generations.\"</p><p>The chemicals are part of a class of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that have become the subject of a growing wave of litigation, as well as increasing scrutiny from federal and state environmental regulators.</p><p>Known as \"forever chemicals\" because they take a very long time to break down in people and the environment, PFAS were widely used in consumer products under brand names such as Teflon and Scotchgard beginning in the 1950s because of their nonstick and water-repellent qualities.</p><p>Mr. Bonta's office wants 3M and the other defendants to establish an abatement fund that could be used for testing and monitoring, drinking water and wastewater treatment, and safe disposal of the chemicals, among other measures. California is also seeking an unspecified amount of damages, restitution and statutory penalties. â€”Bob Tita contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com and Kris Maher at Kris.Maher@wsj.com</p><p>California Sues 3M and DuPont Over PFAS Chemicals</p>",
