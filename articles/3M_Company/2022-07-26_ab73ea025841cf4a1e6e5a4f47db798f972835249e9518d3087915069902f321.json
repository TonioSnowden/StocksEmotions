  "text": "<p>See Now: 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies files for bankruptcy as it looks to resolve Combat Arms Earplugs litigation</p><p>3M is facing claims related to its discontinued Combat Arms Earplugs version 2, which it sold to the U.S. military and consumers. Military service members have blamed the earplugs for causing problems such as hearing loss and tinnitus by inadequately blocking noise from the likes of aircraft and artillery.</p><p>\"3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless face increasing litigation, including approximately 115,000 filed claims and an additional 120,000 claims on an administrative docket as of June 30, 2022,\" said 3M, in a statement.</p><p>See Now: 3M to spin off health care business and create two listed companies</p><p>3M has committed $1 billion to fund the trust. \"We have great respect for the brave men and women who protect us, and remain committed to the military as an active partner and valued customer going forward,\" said 3M Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman, in the statement. \"We determined that taking this decisive action now will allow 3M and Aearo Technologies to address these claims in a way that is more efficient and equitable than the current litigation.\"</p><p>However, lead plaintiffs' counsel Bryan Aylstock of Aylstock Witkin Kreis &amp; Overholtz, PLLC, slammed the level of funding. \"3M's bankruptcy maneuver is further proof that they value their profits and stock price more than the well-being of veterans who fought and served our country,\" he said, in a statement. \"Considering that juries have ruled in favor of 13 out of 19 servicemembers whose cases went to trial and awarded nearly $300 million in damages, the trust to resolve earplug litigation claims is woefully underfunded and not the 'efficient and equitable resolution' that 3M is desperately pretending it is.\"</p><p>See Now: 3M stock rises after mixed earnings, announcement of healthcare spinoff</p><p>Shares of 3M, which also announced mixed second-quarter earnings and the planned spinoff of its healthcare business before market open, rose 6.6% to $142.91 in Tuesday trading. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1% on Tuesday.</p><p>3M's stock has fallen 19.3% this year, compared to the S&amp;P 500's SPX decline of 17.7%.</p><p>See Now: In a busy morning 3M announces healthcare spin off, mixed earnings and subsidiary's voluntary bankruptcy</p><p>Of 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, one has an overweight rating, 14 have a hold rating and six have an underweight or sell rating.</p><p>3M's attempt to resolve earplug litigation 'woefully underfunded' says lead plaintiffs' counsel</p>",
