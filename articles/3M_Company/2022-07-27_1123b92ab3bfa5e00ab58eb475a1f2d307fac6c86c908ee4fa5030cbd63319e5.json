  "text": "<p>The company said it has committed $1 billion to fund a trust to pay claims about its earplugs and $240 million to fund expected expenses related to the cases. 3M said it would provide more funding if required. The company filed for bankruptcy for Aearo Technologies, a subsidiary that once made the earplugs, as a way to fence off the litigation from the rest of 3M.</p><p>Going forward, 3M will consist of three business groups: safety and industrial products, consumers products and electronics and transportation. The company is forecasting that these businesses will have annual sales of $26.8 billion.</p><p>3M shareholders will receive shares in the new company.</p>",
