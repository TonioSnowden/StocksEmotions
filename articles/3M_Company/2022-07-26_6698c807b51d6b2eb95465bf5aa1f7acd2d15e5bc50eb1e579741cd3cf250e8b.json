  "text": "<p>The major indexes are holding onto their July gains, but persistent inflation and signs of a slowing economy are giving investors no leave to relax. This week, the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, also brings a Fed policy meeting at which U.S. central bankers are expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point in their effort to tame rising prices.</p><p>As higher borrowing costs begin to cool economic output, investors are focused on how well household finances and corporate profits are holding up.</p><p>Shares of Walmart fell 8.2% after the country's largest retailer warned that higher prices for food and fuel were causing consumers to pull back. Target shares also fell 4.7%. The firm had noted excess inventories would lead to declining profits going forward in a warning issued in early June.</p><p>General Motors shares fell 2.2% after the car maker's second-quarter profit fell short of estimates. Shares of Raytheon Technologies fell 2.6% after the aerospace and defense company reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations but sales that came up short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>Moody's shares fell 1% after the credit-rating, research and risk-analysis company said its profit and revenue for the second quarter fell. Corning shares dropped 0.7% after the specialty-materials maker's third-quarter guidance fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>But the earnings reports also revealed some bright spots. General Electric shares added 4.8% after the company reported better-than-expected results. Consumer-product manufacturer 3M jumped 4.8% after it said it would spin off its healthcare business to create two public companies. Shares of Archer Daniels Midland added 4.8% following better-than-expected quarterly results.</p><p>Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Alphabet, Visa, Mondelez Internationaland Chipotle Mexican Grillwill report after the closing bell.</p><p>Each report stands to offer clues about how well different corners of industry are withstanding inflation, rising interest rates and many consumers' souring view of the economy. Some investors are worried that the fast tightening of financial conditions will compound economic pressure brought by Covid-19, supply-chain disruptions and the Ukraine war to tip the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>\"You could see a long period of slower growth,\" said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"There's a lot of what's going on right now that can't be modeled.\"</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.734% from 2.819% Monday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 5.2% from its 5 p.m. ET level Monday to trade at $21,015.71 apiece Tuesday, according to CoinDesk.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1.5% to $101.71 a barrel.</p><p>European natural-gas prices rose on concerns that Russia's cut to the Nord Stream pipeline could mean a shortage in Europe come winter. Benchmark futures climbed 10% to â‚¬198.00 a megawatt hour, equivalent to $202.35, according to FactSet, adding to a jump on Monday.</p><p>European countries on Tuesday reached a watered-down agreement to curb their consumption of natural gas over the next eight months in an effort to shield their economies from a possible cutoff of Russian supplies.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1%. UBS Group shares slid 7.8% after the bank reported a small increase in second-quarter earnings, but the results fell short of analysts' expectations. Unilever shares added 2.6% after the retailer said it expects underlying sales growth for the full year to exceed previous guidance, driven by higher prices, although volumes are forecast to be under pressure.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed mostly higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.7%. Alibaba Group Holding will pursue a primary listing of its stock in Hong Kong, hedging its bets as regulatory pressure on Chinese companies grows on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.8%, and South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 ticked 0.2% lower.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Lower With Major Earnings on Tap, Fed Looming</p>",
