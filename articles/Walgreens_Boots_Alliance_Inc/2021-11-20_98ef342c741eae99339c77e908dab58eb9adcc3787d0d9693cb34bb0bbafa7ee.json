  "text": "<p>Tyson is beefing up its prices. The meat giant reported a jump in sales Monday after charging more for its beef, chicken and pork, citing growing costs from labor challenges and grain prices. Tyson -- which produces roughly 1 of every 5 pounds of chicken, beef and pork in the U.S. -- said increasing wages and adding new benefits have helped improve staffing. Over the most recent quarter, Tyson said, the company's average beef prices rose by nearly one-third compared with last year, while pork prices increased by 38% and chicken about 19%. Tyson shares rose 3.6% Monday</p><p>WALMART INC.</p><p>WMT -2.6%</p><p>What supply-chain crisis? As companies scramble to get goods into stores, Walmart shelves are stocked for the holiday season. The big-box retailer on Tuesday reported another quarter of higher sales, as it raised prices for some products and consumers shopped early for the winter holidays. Large companies with deep pockets continue to show they can work around disruptions that are hobbling their smaller competitors. Some of the biggest U.S. retailers, including Walmart, have chartered their own cargo ships to sidestep congestion at U.S. ports. Walmart shares fell 2.6% Tuesday.</p><p>FORD MOTOR CO.</p><p>F -2%</p><p>If you can't find semiconductor chips, make them. That's the view of Ford and General Motors after chip shortages curtailed their output of vehicles. On Thursday both announced new partnerships with semiconductor makers to develop chips; Ford's deal is with GlobalFoundries Inc., and GM forged ties with Qualcomm Inc. and NXP Semiconductors NV. Ford shares lost 2% Thursday.</p><p>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC.</p><p>ATVI -6.1%</p><p>Activision Blizzard's chief executive is facing calls to step down. More than 500 current and former Activision Blizzard employees asked for the resignation of CEO Bobby Kotick after The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that he knew for years about sexual-misconduct allegations at the company. Mr. Kotick has told directors and other executives he wasn't aware of many allegations of misconduct, the Journal reported. Microsoft Corp.'s videogame boss said Thursday that the company is evaluating its relationship with Activision in the wake of the report. Activision shares sank 6.1% Tuesday.</p><p>APPLE INC.</p><p>AAPL +1.7%</p><p>Apple is embracing DIY. The iPhone maker said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The tech giant said the program would begin in early 2022. The company is known for its tight control of the repair process, but the Biden administration in July encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules barring electronics makers from restricting the use of independent repair shops or people repairing their own devices. Apple shares added 1.7% Wednesday.</p><p>SWEETGREEN INC.</p><p>SG +77%</p><p>Investors ate up Sweetgreen's debut on Thursday, the latest new public offering to surge on its first day of trading. Shares of Sweetgreen closed at $49.50, valuing the salad chain -- which is not profitable -- at more than $6 billion on a fully diluted basis. Sweetgreen joins electric-truck maker Rivian Automotive Inc. and sneaker maker Allbirds Inc. in producing big gains in their market debuts this month. Chief Executive Jonathan Neman said that Sweetgreen intends to use much of the new investment to open new U.S. locations. Sweetgreen shares jumped 77% Thursday.</p><p>CVS HEALTH CORP.</p><p>CVS -2.3%</p><p>CVS is going to make do with less. The pharmacy chain said Thursday it will close 900 stores over the next three years -- nearly 10% of its U.S. locations. At the same time, it will add more health services at remaining locations and book a roughly $1 billion restructuring charge. Staffing shortages have stressed both CVS and rival chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as pharmacy employees scramble to juggle Covid-19 testing and vaccines with filling prescriptions and serving customers. CVS shares fell 2.3% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
