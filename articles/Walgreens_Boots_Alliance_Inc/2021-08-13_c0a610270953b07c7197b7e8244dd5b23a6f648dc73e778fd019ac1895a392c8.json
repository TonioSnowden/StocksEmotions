  "title": "Technology:  DoorDash Revenue Climbs 83%  ---  Resilience of food  delivery is a boon for  the company even as  restaurants reopen  ----  By Preetika Rana",
  "text": "<p>   DoorDash Inc.'s second-quarter revenue almost doubled, showing food delivery's resilience even as restaurants reopened across the U.S. and people began moving around again. </p><p>   Revenue in the three months ended June 30 was $1.24 billion, up 83% from the year-earlier quarter when nationwide shutdowns because of Covid-19 propelled blistering growth. That came in slightly higher than the $1.10 billion average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>   The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash. The company commanded more than half of the U.S. food-delivery market at the end of April, up from just over one-third in late 2019, according to market-research firm Edison Trends. </p><p>   The health crisis made consumers more accustomed to the ease of convenience at the touch of a button. DoorDash expanded into delivering everything from toothpaste to toilet paper and Tylenol during the pandemic. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on the websites of retailers like Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc. </p><p>   Continued demand for food delivery, combined with DoorDash's business partnerships and its expansion into new verticals like grocery and convenience items, led the company to raise its full-year outlook on the value of orders placed on its platform. DoorDash said it expects order value this year to be in a range of $39 billion to $40.5 billion, up from the $35 billion to $38 billion range it forecast just three months ago. </p><p>   A looming question for DoorDash and its competitors is just how much will change as the country reopens. The new Covid-19 Delta variant could boost the company's near-term fortunes if it discourages people from going out again; but executives say that it doesn't mean that the company will continue to grow at 2020's breakneck pace. </p><p>   \"You had this hockey stick-like growth in 2020,\" Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar said in an interview. Mr. Adarkar said he expects DoorDash will grow this year, though the pace of growth won't be as dramatic. \"What's encouraging is that you're seeing continued stickiness in terms of consumer behavior. New habits and behaviors have formed,\" he said. </p><p>   DoorDash will focus on investing in growth over near-term profits so it can capitalize on this shift, Mr. Adarkar said. The company expanded to Japan over the quarter. </p><p>   One reason that DoorDash can invest in growth is because the company has been profitable on an adjusted basis before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization for more than a year, including the latest quarter. Companies often point to this metric to signal a path to future profits. These adjustments entail stripping out expenses such as asset write-downs that executives and many investors consider to be outside a company's fundamental operations. </p><p>   Uber Technologies Inc., whose Eats division competes directly with DoorDash, expects to post its first profit on this basis by the end of this year, for example. </p><p>   DoorDash posted an adjusted Ebitda profit of $113 million, compared with $79 million in the same period a year ago. That beat analysts' average forecast. </p><p>   But its net loss was saddled by a $138 million stock-based compensation charge, tied to employees liquidating their shares after the company went public in December. </p><p>   DoorDash posted a $102 million loss for the second quarter compared with a rare $23 million profit in the same period a year ago, when employees couldn't exercise their stock options. </p><p>   DoorDash hasn't posted an annual profit since its inception eight years ago, but it is the only major food-delivery platform to turn a quarterly profit during the pandemic. </p><p>   Executives at DoorDash and Uber Eats have spent the past year testing what they hope will be the secret sauce to long-term growth and profits. They are trying to raise customers' average order size by expanding into more lucrative offerings like groceries and alcohol; bundling nonperishable goods with food to drive down delivery costs; and using technology to reduce errors by restaurants and drivers, translating into fewer refunds. </p><p>   DoorDash is also growing its logistics business, which entails delivering orders that are placed on other retailers' websites. DoorDash now provides delivery services for Walmart, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Petco Health and Wellness Co., among others. </p><p>   These orders are more profitable than the restaurant orders DoorDash receives on its app because it doesn't spend money on marketing to drive those orders, nor does it need to refund consumers when someone goes wrong. </p><p>   Clients like Walmart bring big business, meaning drivers typically carry more than one order at the same time, lowering DoorDash's delivery cost. </p><p></p>",
