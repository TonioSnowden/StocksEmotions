  "title": "NCR Seeks Leveraged-Buyout  Sale to a Private-Equity Firm  ----  By Laura Cooper and Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>    NCR Corp. is in exclusive talks to be sold to private-equity firm Veritas Capital, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be one of the biggest leveraged buyouts as the environment for such deals has become more perilous. </p><p>   A deal could still be weeks away, the people said, and it's far from guaranteed, given that a number of LBOs have been shelved lately because of choppy financing markets. </p><p>   NCR's shares closed up nearly 13% Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported on the exclusive talks. </p><p>   Should a deal get done, it would be one of a small number of relatively big LBOs to be sealed in recent months as rising interest rates boost the cost of deal financing.NCR has a market value of $4 billion. </p><p>   In recent weeks, Kohl's Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. both ended strategic reviews without striking deals. Both companies cited challenges in the financing market. </p><p>   Software company Zendesk Inc. managed to strike a roughly $10 billion deal to be purchased by private-equity firms Permira and Hellman &amp; Friedman LLC in late June. That deal was buoyed by private-credit providers. </p><p>   Founded over 130 years ago, NCR has recently been focused on diversifying its business from hardware-focused products like ATMs and self-checkout technologies to software and services for customers in banking, restaurants and retail. </p><p>   For the first quarter, NCR reported revenue of $1.86 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year, but below its forecast of $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion. The company adjusted its full-year guidance down to about $8 billion in revenue, citing the effects of the war in Ukraine, inflation and the Omicron Covid-19 variant. </p><p>   NCR, formerly known as the National Cash Register Co. and once part of AT&amp;T, in February launched a strategic review that has drawn interest from private-equity suitors. The shares have fallen with tech stocks and were down about 30% this year through Monday. </p><p></p>",
