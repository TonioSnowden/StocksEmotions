The PCE core price index, the Fed's favored inflation measure, rose 5.4% year over year in February, up from 5.2% a month earlier.</p><p>There's room for inflation readings to show “signs of stabilizing and decreasing within the next couple months,” said Andrew Patterson, a senior international economist in Vanguard's investment strategy group, in a phone interview Thursday. “If they're still trending upwards towards June, that's when we're really starting to talk about all the options the Fed has at its disposal.”</p><p>In other economic data released Thursday, consumer spending rose 0.2% in February, below forecast. Meanwhile, data on weekly jobless claims showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose 14,000 last week to 202,000.</p><p>Investors were also taking note of news that President Joe Biden on Thursday announced more releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserves. Biden plans to order the release of 1 million barrels of crude oil per day for the next six months from the reserve, the officials told reporters.</p><p>In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed, as expected, early Thursday to stick with a plan to boost output by 432,000 barrels a day in May. OPEC+ has resisted pleas to more rapidly boost production.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is targeting Russia's technology sector in the latest round of sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said Thursday it is targeting operators in the sector “to prevent it from evading unprecedented multilateral sanctions and procure critical western technology.”</p><p>Seealso: Heavy fighting rages near Kyiv as Russia appears to regroup</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.WBA dropped 5.7% after the drugstore chain reported fiscal second-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations.</p><p>How did other assets fare?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 3.3 basis points to 2.324%.
