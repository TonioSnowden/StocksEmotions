  "title": "Business News: Drugstore Chains Reach Out to Unvaccinated",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration has said it planned to export 80 million donated doses by the end of the month to alleviate global shortages, both through Covax, the international vaccine effort, and directly with partners based on regional need.</p><p>For the U.S. public, there will be fewer vaccine locations to choose from as government-run sites shut down. But it means easier access to shots at retail pharmacies, which no longer require appointments or screen recipients based on need.</p><p>Retailers, from big drugstore chains to grocery pharmacies, are now focused on reaching the unvaccinated and the business they bring. CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which took hits from the pandemic, said they expect to start making money on Covid-related products and services, including tests.</p><p>CVS is reallocating some of the legions of pharmacists and technicians either hired or repurposed for the vaccine push, while \"adapting our model to better meet the demand in each location,\" a spokesman said. The chain will end dedicated vaccine clinics at locations with lower demand, though people can still get shots at all stores.</p><p>Rite Aid, as part of the White House push, extended Friday vaccination hours until midnight at some locations in June, but doesn't plan to do so in July.</p><p>Walgreens, which plans to report quarterly financial results on Thursday, declined to say whether it was scaling back store operations or laying off workers hired to aid in vaccinations. The chain in December said it planned to hire 25,000 people across the U.S., including 8,000 to 9,000 pharmacists and other healthcare workers, to administer the vaccine.</p><p>Walgreens recently started giving $25 to be used toward a purchase to customers who receive a vaccine.</p>",
