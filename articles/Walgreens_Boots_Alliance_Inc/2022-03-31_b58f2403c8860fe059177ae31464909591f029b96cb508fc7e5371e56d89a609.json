  "text": "<p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. didn't agree to settle and is headed for a jury trial set to start April 5 in New Port Richey, Fla. Walgreens said a 2012 settlement covered the recent claims and said the allegations are unjustified.</p><p>Teva said Wednesday it will pay $177 million to Florida over 15 years and provide generic Narcan, or naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray, valued at $84 million over 10 years. Allergan will pay $134 million, the state said.</p><p>Ashley Moody, the attorney general of Florida, sued CVS, Walgreens and several drugmakers alleging the companies inflated supply and demand for opioids and \"created illegitimate demand for dangerous opioids while unlawfully increasing the supply of opioids to meet that demand.\"</p><p>CVS said the settlement, which will be paid over 18 years, includes no admission of wrongdoing and that it would continue to defend against other lawsuits relating to opioids.</p><p>Teva said its settlement isn't an admission of liability or wrongdoing. The company said it would continue to defend itself in court in states where it hasn't reached an agreement.</p><p>Allergan, a unit of AbbVie Inc., had no immediate comment. Its settlement agreement with Florida denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>The nation's chain pharmacies face hundreds of lawsuits involving the opioid crisis. The companies argued that they had tried to stop pills from being illegally diverted and followed procedures required by federal and state regulators. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid Corp. last summer settled with two New York counties, for a combined $26 million without admitting wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2021, a group of states unveiled a $26 billion settlement with drug companies and distributors to resolve thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits.</p>",
