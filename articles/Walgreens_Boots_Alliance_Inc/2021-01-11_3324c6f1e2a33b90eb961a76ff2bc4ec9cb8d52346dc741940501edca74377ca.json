  "title": "In Connecticut, Rollout Goes Smoothly  ---  State has administered  about half of allotted  doses, compared with  about 28% nationally  ----  By Joseph De Avila",
  "text": "<p>   Connecticut's Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been relatively smooth, health officials said, while the U.S. and many states lag behind their original distribution plans. </p><p>   The state has administered about half its allotted doses, compared with neighboring New York, which has administered nearly one-third of its allotment, and New Jersey, with little more than a quarter of its doses distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the U.S., about 28% of all the first doses have been administered, according to the CDC. </p><p>   The shortfall is due in part to a lag in reporting data, government officials and health experts said. But as the federal government has left it to states to determine what to do with the vaccines, and with some states pushing decision-making to local health departments and hospitals, the process has hit snags in many places. </p><p>   Connecticut hospital executives said open lines of communication with Gov. Ned Lamont's office and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with good coordination among the state's hospitals have been important factors during the first phase. About 300,000 health-care and long-term-care workers are eligible for the first phase. </p><p>   \"Our hospital systems, our federally qualified health centers and our local health departments have been successful in standing up very large clinics in very short order and getting those employees into those clinics and getting them vaccinated,\" said the state's acting health commissioner, Deidre Gifford. </p><p>   Connecticut had administered nearly 100,000 of its first doses, or about 47%, as of Wednesday, according to the Department of Public Health. </p><p>   The number of vaccines distributed to each state depends on the population size, so large states like New York have a more complicated task. </p><p>   In New Jersey, health officials have said many health-care workers opted to wait until after the holidays to get their first shot, delaying the state's vaccination progress. The vaccination numbers also likely reflect an undercount because of reporting lags for hospitals and long-term-care facilities, health officials have said. </p><p>   New York's vaccine-distribution effort has been marked by public spats between Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration and local elected officials. The governor's team has assumed control of the vaccine-distribution efforts and set strict penalties for misallocating doses. </p><p>   In Connecticut, communication and coordination between the state and hospitals hasn't been a problem, said Thomas Balcezak, chief clinical officer of Yale New Haven Hospital. The hospitals in the state are working well together, too, with his facility recently receiving a couple of hundred doses from another hospital when it was in need, he said. </p><p>   Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, said the hospitals laid the groundwork for a good relationship with the state at the start of the pandemic, sharing data and coordinating a response to the health emergency. </p><p>   During weekly calls, state and hospital officials talk about current concerns, as well as any problems they should anticipate for the next week and out into the future, Mr. Kidwell said. \"There is a strong commitment to troubleshooting on a daily basis, and I think it's been beneficial to getting the vaccine administered,\" he said. </p><p>   Every nursing home in Connecticut will have concluded its first round of vaccinations by Sunday, according to the Department of Public Health. </p><p>   The federal effort to vaccinate nursing-home workers and residents is being led by CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. Chris Cox, a CVS executive who is overseeing the vaccination program for the company, said there have been no major problems with the program in Connecticut and the company's relationship with the state \"has been seamless.\" </p><p>   But the first phase of vaccine distribution in Connecticut hasn't been without its hiccups. As in other states, a significant number of health-care and long-term-care staffers are wary of taking the vaccine. </p><p>   \"Our problem is not shooting it into people's arms,\" Dr. Balcezak said. \"Our problem is making sure people want it and we have the vaccine from the federal allocation.\" </p><p>   He said the majority of the medical staff at his hospital trust the safety of the vaccine and intend to get vaccinated, but most food-service and cleaning staff are still reluctant to be immunized. </p><p>   The state had estimated 80% of the health-care and long-term-care workforce would get vaccinated. That number is hovering around 60% for hospital workers and about 50% or lower for long-term-care workers, Dr. Gifford said. </p><p>   The lower acceptance rate means the state will open up the next phase of vaccinations -- for people 75 and older, front-line essential workers and people living in congregate settings like group homes -- in mid-January as opposed to the end of January as originally planned, Dr. Gifford said. </p><p>   The next phase of vaccinations, which comprises about 800,000 people, will be even more challenging, she said. </p><p>   \"We are going to be working with a wider range of employers not in the health-care sector, but also individuals not affiliated with any employer,\" Dr. Gifford said. The state is working on a process for scheduling that is easily accessible to people who don't have good internet access or computer skills and for non-English speakers. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
