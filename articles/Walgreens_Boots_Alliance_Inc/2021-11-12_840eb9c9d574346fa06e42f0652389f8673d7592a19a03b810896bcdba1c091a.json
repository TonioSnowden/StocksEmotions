  "title": "Ten recommended stocks if you think value will beat growth as inflation surges",
  "text": "<p>That's the theory, at least: Growth stocks derive a disproportionate share of their valuation from future years' earnings, so they should disproportionately suffer when higher inflation means that the present value of those earnings is lower.</p><p>The last several months have provided a real-world test of this theory, and so far it's failed. It was in mid-May, you may recall, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first reported that inflation was running far higher than expected. Since then, despite constant reassurances that inflation's spike was merely transitory, inflation has become worse. This week, it was reported that inflation was running at its fastest pace in over 30 years — 6.2%, versus “only” 4.2% in the May release from BLS.</p><p>Contrary to the theory, however, growth stocks have dominated the market since mid-May. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF VOOG has gained 23%, in contrast to just 7% for the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF VOOV. (The full index, of course, is the S&amp;P 500 Index SPX.)</p><p>My hunch about the source of value stocks' unexpectedly disappointing performance since May: Investors initially believed the “inflation is transitory” narrative. As recently as September, for example, the headline of the MarketWatch story reporting the latest release of CPI data asked the question “Has inflation peaked?”</p><p>To the extent my hunch is correct, and to the extent high inflation is not transitory, value stocks should soon reassert their historical dominance. There are early indications that this may be happening: Since the mid-week release of unexpectedly high inflation, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF has outperformed the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF by 0.6 percentage points.</p><p>Two days do not a trend make, of course. In the meantime, one way to consider betting on value's imminent dominance would be with the value stocks currently recommended by the advisory newsletters with the best long-term performance. Such stocks stand a good chance of performing well even if value isn't beginning a sustained period of outperforming growth.</p><p>Exactly one year ago, for example, I presented a list of such stocks. Since then, even though value and growth are close to being neck-and-neck for total returns, the value stocks I listed in that year-ago column have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a margin of 51.7% to 31.3%.</p><p>For this column I repeat the multi-step process to construct a new list. I started with stocks that are recommended by at least three of the top performers. I narrowed down the list by including only those whose price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios are below those of the S&amp;P 500 and whose dividend yields are above.</p><p>Ten stocks survived this winnowing process, and they are listed below. (The data on each stock's valuations are from FactSet.)</p><p> Stock                                      Number of newsletters recommending  Price/book ratio  Price/earnings ratio  Dividend yield  International Business Machines Corp.
