  "title": "CVS Health Posts Higher Revenue as Customers Seek Covid-19 Tests, Vaccines; The company gave 11 million vaccinations and eight million tests in the latest quarter as the pandemic persisted",
  "text": "<p>Third-quarter sales were $73.79 billion overall, a rise from $67.06 billion in 2020's third quarter. CVS posted an adjusted profit of $1.97 a share, up from $1.66 a share a year earlier.</p><p>The results exceeded the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted sales of $70.52 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.79 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>As the Delta variant of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. through the summer, Covid-19 concerns continued to bring customers to pharmacies. The company administered more than eight million tests in the quarter as CVS's testing program expanded.</p><p>CVS also administered 11 million Covid-19 vaccinations in the quarter. Its pharmacies, as well as those of competitors such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp., have been a key venue for distributing shots since the U.S.'s vaccination campaign ramped up around the start of this year. More recently, the companies have been preparing to offer larger volumes of booster shots and vaccinations for children and teens.</p><p>That effort—like the operations of companies large and small of late—has strained against hiring difficulties as the economy lurches back into gear. In September, CVS launched a one-day career event meant to draw 25,000 new workers, as the company anticipated staffing needs for Covid-19 shots and tests as well as flu shots.</p><p>The company is also raising its minimum hourly wage to $15.</p><p>Meanwhile, income edged higher in CVS's health-insurance business, which includes the Aetna insurance company. Its government-services arm improved in performance, CVS said, which offset higher costs related to Covid-19.</p><p>Looking ahead, CVS lifted its full-year outlook. It said it now expects to report a per-share adjusted profit of $7.90 to $8.00 in 2021, up from a previous forecast of $7.70 to $7.80.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Health Posts Higher Revenue as Customers Seek Covid-19 Tests, Vaccines</p>",
