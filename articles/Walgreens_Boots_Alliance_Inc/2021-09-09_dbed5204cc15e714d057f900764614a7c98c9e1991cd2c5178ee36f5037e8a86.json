  "title": "Trial of Theranos Founder Begins",
  "text": "<p>The beginning of Ms. Holmes's trial marked a new chapter in the fall of a Silicon Valley superstar, a drama that inspired books and television series since Theranos dissolved three years ago. After months of delays due to the pandemic and Ms. Holmes's pregnancy, the government laid out its case against the 37-year-old Stanford University dropout whose charisma and salesmanship helped vault her blood-testing startup's valuation to more than $9 billion before its implosion over its technology's repeated failures.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's attorneys took their turn before the jury to portray Ms. Holmes as a hardworking entrepreneur who may have been a bit naive but had conviction she could achieve technological breakthroughs.</p><p>\"Failure is not a crime,\" said Lance Wade, an attorney with Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly LLP. \"Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime.\"</p><p>Ms. Holmes pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The maximum penalty for each wire fraud count is 20 years in prison.</p><p>The opening remarks were the first opportunity for Ms. Holmes's lawyers and prosecutors with the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of California to influence the jury in a trial that will feature weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses.</p><p>Over about 45 minutes, Mr. Leach told jurors Ms. Holmes defrauded patients and investors with claims of revolutionary blood-testing technology that could test for a range of health conditions using a few drops of blood from a finger prick. Those claims helped draw in board members like former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and investors including former education secretary Betsy DeVos and Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>In fact, Mr. Leach said, the company's technology didn't work and Ms. Holmes knew it.</p><p>The Journal's investigative reporting in 2015 and 2016 exposed how Theranos Inc.'s technology didn't work, how the company tried to cover up its failures and how patients' lives were affected and their health jeopardized.</p><p>Government prosecutors described Ms. Holmes as willing to cut corners and cheat to raise the funding needed to keep her company afloat. By 2013, Theranos was in \"a rush, a scramble,\" Mr. Leach told jurors, as its business partners Walgreens Boots Alliance and Safeway Inc. waited for Theranos's blood-testing machines to be rolled out to their customers in stores across the country.</p><p>Walgreens offered Theranos blood-testing technology in 41 of its pharmacies and had plans for many more before suspending the relationship after the Journal's Theranos reporting. Safeway built clinics in 800 of its supermarkets to offer Theranos blood tests but dissolved the relationship before patients got the company's tests there.</p><p>Theranos had brought in half a million dollars in revenue in 2011 and no revenue at all in 2012 and 2013, Mr. Leach said, citing coming testimony from a top Theranos finance officer. In 2013, he said the company was burning through $1 million to $2 million a week. \"In a matter of months, Theranos would be out of money,\" said Mr. Leach.</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, Theranos's No. 2 executive and her one-time boyfriend, directed employees to alter commercial blood machines to work with small amounts of blood. \"This was a way to deceive Walgreens and Safeway, and to stall, and to buy time,\" Mr. Leach said.</p><p>Ms. Holmes courted the media to win favorable coverage about the company's blood analyzers and used the publicity to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. She and Mr. Balwani raised that money, prosecutors allege, based on a series of false and misleading statements, including that Theranos's technology had been blessed by major pharmaceutical companies and it was being deployed by the American military on the battlefield to save soldiers' lives.</p><p>\"This is a case about fraud, about lying and cheating to get money,\" Mr. Leach said.</p><p>To win a conviction, government lawyers must convince the jury that Ms. Holmes intended to commit fraud, not simply that the company ran into problems living up to its promises.</p><p>Mr. Leach told jurors he would show them \"email after email\" where issues were brought directly to Ms. Holmes's attention. She was a hands-on CEO, he said, and \"the buck stopped with her.\"</p><p>In the defense's opening statements, Mr. Wade said Ms. Holmes, who started the company at 19, dedicated 15 years to the quest of improving lab testing, and never sold a single share in the company that she owned, evidence of her commitment to the mission. Speaking for about two hours, Mr. Wade painted Mr. Balwani as a bad influence and suggested their relationship had an ugly side that most people never saw.</p><p>Mr. Balwani faces a separate trial next year and pleaded not guilty to the same charges as Ms. Holmes. In court filings, Ms. Holmes's lawyers said the couple had an abusive relationship that affected her decision-making as head of Theranos -- though Mr. Wade stopped short of drawing that connection in court Wednesday. A lawyer for Mr. Balwani has denied any allegations of abuse.</p><p>Mr. Wade disputed that Ms. Holmes knew the tests weren't accurate and reliable, saying that at the time, \"she had every reason to believe that the lab operations were under control and that an appropriate system was in place.\" He also dismissed the allegations that Ms. Holmes defrauded investors, whom he said fully understood the risks they took investing in a fledgling startup.</p><p>After opening statements concluded, the government called So Han Spivey as its first witness. Ms. Spivey, who also goes by Danise Yam, managed finances at Theranos for more than a decade. She began to testify about times that Theranos had trouble making payroll and the company's widening annual losses. She will face more questioning Friday.</p>",
