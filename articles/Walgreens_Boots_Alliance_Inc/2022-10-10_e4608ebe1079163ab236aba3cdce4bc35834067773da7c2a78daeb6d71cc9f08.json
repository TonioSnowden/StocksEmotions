  "title": "U.S. Stocks Waver Amid Volatile Trading; Shifting expectations about Fed's interest-rate increases and further escalation in Ukraine war weigh on markets",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have swung in recent days, driven by shifting expectations about more interest-rate increases from the Fed. Friday's jobs report showed the labor market is still tight as the unemployment rate fell back to a half-century low, exacerbating concerns that the Fed could tighten financial conditions more aggressively. Investors are looking ahead to the next U.S. inflation data release Thursday as another important indicator.</p><p>\"There's still that hangover in markets. The U.S. labor market is still incredibly strong and the Fed has a single mandate right now: inflation,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"The most important number in the world right now\" is the coming inflation figure, he said.</p><p>The Ukraine war is also coming back to the forefront of investors' minds, due to damage to a key bridge in Crimea over the weekend and the bombardment of Kyiv and other cities Monday morning.</p><p>\"This could mean less relief for inflation over the next few months, if oil prices rebound,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Oil prices were relatively unchanged with global crude benchmark Brent trading at $97.81 a barrel. Traders said they were focusing on the coming inflation data and what it could mean for Fed policy.</p><p>Earnings season is picking up speed, with household names in the consumer and finance sectors set to report this week. PepsiCo is on the docket for Wednesday and Delta Air Lines, Walgreens Boots Alliance and BlackRock will give updates Thursday. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will report on Friday.</p><p>\"Everyone is expecting a poor earnings season but quite a lot of that is already priced in. We're expecting downgrades, guidance coming down. But that still doesn't mean we can't get negative surprises,\" Ms. Dwek said.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. The Bank of England saidit may increase bond purchases that are part of a market-stabilizing operation and put forward a new repo facility for banks. U.K. government bonds sold off. The yield on the 30-year gilt rose to 4.586% from 4.380% on Friday, extending its climb into a sixth consecutive trading session.</p><p>\"It's a credibility issue. The bank saying it may or may not buy some bonds doesn't deal with that,\" said James Athey, an investment manager at Abrdn. The British government sparked turmoil in U.K. markets in recent weeks with an unpopular package of tax cuts.</p><p>\"Also, the closer we get to the date this program is due to end, the more nervous investors holding long-dated gilts are going to get,\" Mr. Athey said. The program is set to end on Friday.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3%.</p><p>The U.S. bond market is closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. Japanese and South Korean stock markets were also shut for public holidays.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Waver Amid Volatile Trading</p>",
