  "title": "DoorDash Revenue Rises 83% as Consumers Stick to Food Delivery; Company sees expanded offerings and delivery partnerships spurring growth amid uncertainty from Delta variant",
  "text": "<p>The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash. The company commanded more than half of the U.S. food-delivery market at the end of April, up from just over one-third in late 2019, according to market-research firm Edison Trends.</p><p>The health crisis made consumers more accustomed to the ease of convenience at the touch of a button. DoorDash expanded into delivering everything from toothpaste to toilet paper and Tylenol during the pandemic. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on the websites of retailers like Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.</p><p>Continued demand for food delivery, combined with DoorDash's business partnerships and its expansion into new verticals like grocery and convenience items, led the company to raise its full-year outlook on the value of orders placed on its platform. DoorDash said it expects order value this year to be in a range of $39 billion to $40.5 billion, up from the $35 billion to $38 billion range it forecast just three months ago.</p><p>A looming question for DoorDash and its competitors is just how much will change as the country reopens. The new Covid-19 Delta variant could boost the company's near-term fortunes if it discourages people from going out again; but executives say that it doesn't mean that the company will continue to grow at 2020's breakneck pace.</p><p>\"You had this hockey stick-like growth in 2020,\" Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar said in an interview. Mr. Adarkar said he expects DoorDash will grow this year, though the pace of growth won't be as dramatic. DoorDash's shares fell nearly 5% in after-hours trading.</p><p>\"What's encouraging is that you're seeing continued stickiness in terms of consumer behavior. New habits and behaviors have formed,\" Mr. Adarkar said.</p><p>He added that DoorDash will focus on investing in growth over near-term profits so it can capitalize on this shift. The company expanded to Japan over the quarter.</p><p>One reason that DoorDash can invest in growth is because the company has been profitable on an adjusted basis before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization for more than a year, including the latest quarter. Companies often point to this metric to signal a path to future profits. These adjustments entail stripping out expenses such as asset write-downs that executives and many investors consider to be outside a company's fundamental operations.</p><p>Uber Technologies Inc., whose Eats division competes directly with DoorDash, expects to post its first profit  on this basis by the end of this year, for example.</p><p>DoorDash posted an adjusted Ebitda profit of $113 million, compared with $79 million in the same period a year ago. That beat analysts' average forecast.</p><p>But its net loss was saddled by a $138 million stock-based compensation charge, tied to employees liquidating their shares after the company went public in December. DoorDash posted a $102 million loss for the second quarter compared with a rare $23 million profit in the same period a year ago, when employees couldn't exercise their stock options.</p><p>DoorDash hasn't posted an annual profit since its inception eight years ago, but it is the only major food-delivery platform to turn a quarterly profit during the pandemic.</p><p>Executives at DoorDash and Uber Eats have spent the past year testing what they hope will be the secret sauce to long-term growth and profits . They are trying to raise customers' average order size by expanding into more lucrative offerings  like groceries and alcohol; bundling nonperishable goods with food to drive down delivery costs; and using technology to reduce errors by restaurants and drivers, translating into fewer refunds.</p><p>DoorDash is also growing its logistics business, which entails delivering orders that are placed on other retailers' websites. DoorDash now provides delivery services for Walmart, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Petco Health and Wellness Co., among others.</p><p>These orders are more profitable than the restaurant orders DoorDash receives on its app because it doesn't spend money on marketing to drive those orders, nor does it need to refund consumers when someone goes wrong. Clients like Walmart bring big business, meaning drivers typically carry more than one order at the same time, lowering DoorDash's delivery cost .</p><p>Mr. Adarkar said the company added a record number of first-time drivers to its platform in the second quarter. DoorDash isn't facing a shortage of drivers, unlike Uber and Lyft Inc. But it was forced to boost its advertising spending because the ride-share companies have driven up prices for driver ads amid the shortage, the company said. DoorDash's increased ad spending, combined with its focus on consumer growth, meant sales and marketing costs more than doubled to $427 million in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.</p><p>There are other challenges  as DoorDash navigates a post-pandemic world. Many U.S. cities temporarily capped the commissions DoorDash and others could charge restaurants during the pandemic, and some are considering making those caps permanent. DoorDash said Thursday that these caps translated to $26 million in lost revenue. Last month, DoorDash and rival Grubhub Inc. sued San Francisco over its decision to make its cap permanent.</p><p>DoorDash has made some concessions  in an attempt to appease restaurants. Earlier this year, the company said it would allow restaurants to choose from three commission rates, offering varying degrees of marketing and product support based on the selection.</p><p>Write to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com </p><p>DoorDash Revenue Rises 83% as Consumers Stick to Food Delivery</p>",
