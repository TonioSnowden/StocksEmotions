  "title": "CVS, Walmart Limit Purchases of Plan B Pills After Surge in Demand; Retailers' websites show the emergency contraceptive in short supply after Supreme Court's abortion decision",
  "text": "<p>Walmart didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A CVS spokesman said the company has implemented temporary purchase limits to ensure equitable access, and that it has ample supply of the pills in stores and online.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which also had a purchase limit on its website, said the restriction was an error and that it would soon be corrected. A spokesman said the company is investigating the situation.</p><p>The pills are often referred to and sold under the Plan B brand without a prescription. Also called morning-after pills, they are designed to be taken up to three days after unprotected sex. The medication mainly works by preventing ovulation and, failing that, may stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus.</p><p>Plan B pills are different from medication abortion, also known as plan C, which requires a prescription and involves the administration of different pills to terminate a pregnancy. In the U.S., medication abortion has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Two medications—mifepristone and misoprostol—are typically used in a medication abortion regimen.</p><p>Several companies make versions of Plan B that range in cost from $10 to more than $50. On Monday, the cheapest option available from major retailers' websites was a pill for $35. There are three types of emergency contraceptive pills: progestin-only pills like levonorgestrel (sold under the brand name Plan B, among others), ulipristal (brand name Ella) and combined emergency contraception pills that consist of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. The latter two types require prescriptions.</p><p>Plan B One Step, the top-selling emergency contraceptive, is owned by a pair of private-equity firms, Kelso &amp; Co. and Juggernaut Capital Partners. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. sold the brand in 2017 to the investors as part of a move to shed its women's health business. Representatives from the firms didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In the days following Friday's court decision, social media filled with comments either encouraging or dissuading people to stock up on the contraceptive. Some users posted that they were buying as many as possible; others argued against stockpiling for fear it would cut off access to people with an immediate need.</p><p>Planned Parenthood, in a statement Monday, advised against stockpiling emergency contraceptives as they have limited shelf-life and because hoarding supplies could limit access for women who have an immediate need.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>CVS, Walmart Limit Purchases of Plan B Pills After Surge in Demand</p>",
