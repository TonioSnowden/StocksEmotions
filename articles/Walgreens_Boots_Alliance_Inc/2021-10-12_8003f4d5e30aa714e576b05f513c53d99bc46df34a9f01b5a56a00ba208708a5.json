  "text": "<p>Collapse of Theranos</p><p>* Live coverage of the trial</p><p>* A Theranos Timeline: The Downfall of Elizabeth Holmes, a Silicon Valley Superstar</p><p>Ms. Holmes, 37 years old, is charged with defrauding patients and investors, with the top charges carrying a maximum federal prison sentence of 20 years. She has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Here are a few of the revelations we have heard so far in testimony or seen in court exhibits.</p><p>A key source revealed</p><p>Former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff emerged over five days of testimony as not just a key witness for the prosecution, but as one of The Wall Street Journal's original sources during its 2015 reporting into failures at the company.</p><p>Dr. Rosendorff said during questioning from prosecutors that he received a phone call from then-Journal reporter John Carreyrou and decided to speak off the record about his time at Theranos.</p><p>\"Even months after I left the company, I felt obligated from a moral and ethical perspective to alert the public,\" Dr. Rosendorff testified on Sept. 28. He saidhe hadn't quite known how to do that, \"but when this opportunity presented itself, I took advantage of it.\"</p><p>Mr. Carreyrou, who left the Journal in 2019, later confirmed that Dr. Rosendorff was his \"first and most important source\" and said that, \"Without him, I wouldn't have been able to break the Theranos story.\"</p><p>Safeway was promised 20-minute tests, $10 per-test profit</p><p>When former Safeway Inc. Chief Executive Steven Burd took the witness stand in the trial, the full extent of the promises Theranos made to the grocery-store chain finally became clear.</p><p>As the two companies hammered out a deal in 2010 that would have put blood-testing devices in hundreds of grocery stores, Theranos guaranteed Safeway a $10-per-test profit, Mr. Burd testified in October. A profit seemed plausible at the time, Mr. Burd recalled, because Elizabeth Holmes told Safeway that Theranos projected $223 million in revenue in 2011 and $167 million in operating expenses, with an adjusted profit of $56 million. In reality, the company had far less revenue and substantial losses until it shut down, court testimony has shown.</p><p>For Theranos, the Safeway partnership was a crucial way to expand its reach to consumers. Mr. Burd said he had long been interested in improving healthcare and also saw it as a way to boost the grocer's slim profit margins.</p><p>Safeway first met with Theranos around March 2010, Mr. Burd testified, and struck a deal that September that included Safeway investing $85 million. Safeway ended up spending more than $350 million on the failed partnership, an amount prosecutors say underscores how the company was victimized by Theranos, but that Ms. Holmes's lawyers say is largely money Theranos never asked them to spend.</p><p>Mr. Burd testified that Theranos told Safeway its devices could perform 95% of all blood tests and results would be available to customers in 20 to 30 minutes, which he said was crucial so shoppers could get their results back in the time it took them to buy groceries. Theranos pitched Ms. Holmes as a Stanford University Ph.D. student in chemical and electrical engineering, according to a 2010 presentation shown in court; it didn't mention that Ms. Holmes dropped out of Stanford after one year of undergraduate study.</p><p>The partnership was set for a full Safeway-wide launch in the middle of 2011. By the time Mr. Burd retired in May 2013, he testified, Theranos blood-testing devices still weren't in his grocery stores.</p><p>Mattis personally invested</p><p>Former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis revealed on the stand that he was not only a board member and longtime supporter of Ms. Holmes, but had invested $85,000 of his personal money in January 2014 to give himself \"skin in the game.\"</p><p>\"And was that a significant investment for you at the time?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bostic asked.</p><p>\"For someone who had been in government service for 40 years, yes,\" the retired general replied.</p><p>Blindsided board</p><p>Emails shown in court during the testimony of Mr. Mattis showed that while the Theranos board publicly expressed support for Ms. Holmes after the Journal's initial reporting in 2015, privately they were pressing for answers.</p><p>\"At this moment, how many of our customer submissions are being tested on lab equipment versus Edison?\" former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich asked in an email to board members and Ms. Holmes, referring to Theranos's proprietary blood-testing device.</p><p>On the witness stand, Mr. Mattis said that he shared the concerns Mr. Kovacevich raised.</p><p>A few weeks later, a Theranos lawyer circulated a supportive statement the company planned to issue on behalf of the board.</p><p>Mr. Kovacevich pushed back on the wording, writing that calling the board \"'familiar with the technology,' is a stretch.\" Gary Roughead, a former U.S. Navy officer and board member, sent an email saying he agreed. The line came out.</p><p>Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, Theranos's former No. 2, told the board there were plans to conduct three studies, including one comparing finger-stick performance to traditional blood draws, and to seek publication of the results in peer-reviewed journals.</p><p>For William Frist, a former U.S. senator and, as a surgeon, the only board member with significant medical experience, the promises weren't enough.</p><p>\"Integrity of lab data is at the heart of everything,\" he wrote to the group. \"That would have been good strategy months ago and still is appropriate but what we need asap is evidence of accuracy.\"</p><p>The same day, Theranos released the board's joint statement, which said, \"Theranos's technology is both transformative and transparent.\" It continued: \"As a group, we embrace this promise and stand with Theranos.\"</p><p>Forged documents</p><p>During opening statements, prosecutor Robert Leach described how Ms. Holmes told investors that Theranos's technology had been validated by 10 of the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies, a claim he says was outright false.</p><p>Mr. Leach showed jurors a document with the Pfizer logo that he said Ms. Holmes portrayed to investors as evidence of the pharmaceutical giant's support. In fact, he said, it was a forged document.</p><p>\"Pfizer did not write this. Pfizer did not put its logo on this. Pfizer did not give its permission to put its logo on this. Pfizer did not make the conclusions in this report,\" Mr. Leach said in court last week.</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes's Theranos Trial in Pictures: Inside a Courthouse Saga</p><p>The company founder's family and other supporters have been attending the proceedings to hear lawyers and witnesses lay out the case. </p><p>https://www.wsj.com/story/elizabeth-holmess-theranos-trial-in-pictures-inside-a-courthouse-saga-4ad7a88f</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes's Theranos Trial in Pictures: Inside a Courthouse Saga. The company founder's family and other supporters have been attending the proceedings to hear lawyers and witnesses lay out the case. PHOTO: Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Pfizer did have a $900,000 contract before 2009, he said, but after seeing initial reports from Theranos it concluded it had no use for Theranos's technology and never did business with the company again.</p><p>A Pfizer spokeswoman said it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on an ongoing criminal trial but that the company \"has fully cooperated with prosecutors throughout this process.\"</p><p>Losses piling up</p><p>Theranos's longtime corporate controller, Danise Yam, who was the top financial officer for many years, testified that the company had accumulated losses of more than $585 million from 2003 to 2015. The company reported that number to the IRS on its 2015 tax returns, jurors were shown.</p><p>Ms. Yam spoke of years when the company brought in no money at all, and periods when they burned through $1 million to $2 million a week. On cross-examination by one of Ms. Holmes's attorneys, Ms. Yam, who also goes by the name So Han Spivey, said the largest expenditure in many years was research and development costs.</p><p>More investment than previously thought</p><p>Investors poured more money into the company than previously known: $944.56 million over six investment rounds, according to a March 15, 2015, report from a firm called Aranca that was repeatedly hired to value the company.</p><p>Ms. Yam testified that she gave internal financial information to Aranca to help it assess Theranos's valuation. Later, prosecutors showed that far rosier revenue projections were given to potential investors than what Ms. Yam gave to Aranca, something Ms. Yam said she couldn't explain. In one instance, Theranos told investors to expect $990 million in revenue in 2015, while the company had told Aranca that it would have $113 million or less in revenue.</p><p>Potential business lines</p><p>In addition to its well-known partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. that put Theranos testing centers in Walgreens pharmacies, Theranos explored some partnerships that haven't previously come to light.</p><p>Text messages from April 2015 included in court filings show Theranos also had its sights on a partnership with Highmark Inc., a healthcare company in Pittsburgh. Ms. Holmes texted Mr. Balwani, \"Highmark CEO 100% deal done,\" and that another Highmark executive apologized for not working with Theranos, acknowledging it was a \"huge mistake.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What have you found most interesting about the Theranos trial? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Theranos never launched a blood-testing partnership with Highmark. Highmark spokesman Aaron Billger said, \"A proposal was presented to us—like the many we receive annually on new ventures. After further review, the decision was made to not invest.\"</p><p>Ms. Yam's testimony also brought to light that Theranos had a $288,000 contract in its early years to provide cartridges and devices to the American Burn Association, a group that helps burn victims through research and services. On cross-examination, Ms. Yam said that work was done in connection with the Defense Department. The American Burn Association didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani lied to investors about having a profitable business relationship with the Defense Department and having Theranos technology deployed on the battlefield.</p><p>Hiring private investigators</p><p>Court filings show the extent to which Theranos tried to keep former employees from talking about the company after they left. Records detail $150,000 paid to investigations firm Interfor and private investigator David Fechheimer for what was listed in records as \"E. Cheung &amp; T. Shultz project\"—a reference to Erika Cheung and Tyler Shultz, two junior Theranos employees who quit over concerns about the company's practices and later spoke out, including to the Journal, about their experience.</p><p>Interfor declined to comment. Mr. Fechheimer died in 2019.</p><p>Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com and Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>What the Elizabeth Holmes Trial Is Revealing About Theranos</p>",
