  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week,</p> <p>It has been a gloriously balmy few days in London. You have to hold on to such things in these troubled times. Sadly, like the global news agenda, the UK forecast is for more clouds on the way. I'm afraid to say that in the coming seven days, the bleak still has the upper hand over the bright.</p> <p>Brussels will again be the venue for debate on the Ukraine invasion, firstly with a meeting of EU interior ministers on Monday to discuss the resulting refugee crisis and then on Thursday when Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg presents the military alliance's annual report.</p> <p>It is one of those quirks of British life — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c14cc550-6317-4fa9-b340-b8fe1c79ca2d\">explained so well in this piece from the FT archive</a> — that the UK's personal tax year will start on April 6, so more on that next weekend. This Friday, however, marks the date for corporate and government financial statements. This will have extra significance this year because it will lay bare the roots of current inflationary pressures. It will also be the day when the significantly higher energy price cap comes into force. </p> <p>Perhaps it is better to reflect on significant figures of our recent past, who have passed away. It is a busy week for that with a remembrance service for Prince Philip in London — a day before the 20th anniversary of the Queen Mother's death — and a memorial to legendary cricketer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfe12eef-b863-4885-a844-877e40cef26c\">Shane Warne</a> in Melbourne.</p> <p>Reasons to be cheerful? European bison will be returning to British soil, where they were previously hunted to extinction, with a project to <a href=\"https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/explore-rewilding/reintroductions-key-species/rewilding-superstars/european-bison\">rewild parts of Kent</a>, where it is hoped the animals will help local woodlands to flourish. And before you ask, no, this will not be an April Fool's Day joke.</p> <p>Something else that has been returning after a period of extinction in the UK is railway nationalisation. The latest example is ScotRail, which will be returned to public ownership on Friday after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52ad3178-21bc-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">Holyrood government cancelled the franchise</a> with Abellio amid criticism of its performance. It also revives the debate about whether direct control is a better solution than Westminster's decision to create a mixed economy system under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05fef011-f693-46a2-bfcd-fbdfffe4368d\">Great British Railways</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b0a0d0e-e418-4346-84f6-eabefa099fd6\">state-owned body</a> akin to Transport for London that will contract out national train service routes.</p> <p>Do please get in touch — you can email me at <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>Not satisfied with the quantity of inflation news so far? Well, you are in luck because we have a week of consumer price index and producer price index reports from European nations. We'll also get GDP estimates from the US, the UK and Canada, plus international comparisons of business confidence with the manufacturing purchasing managers' index data on Friday.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>Earnings season is nearly at an end — ready for the start of the next quarter — but this week will bring an earnings announcement from Covid-19 vaccine poster child <strong>BioNTech</strong>. The resurgence of cases in the UK and other countries has led to calls for fourth doses among some more vulnerable groups, showing that vaccine demand is unlikely to dip any time soon. BioNTech is among a group of companies expected to publish late-stage trial results on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3963f1fa-64d7-4c68-9afb-bfba02c26971\">Omicron-targeted shots</a> imminently.</p> <p>New <strong>Burberry</strong> chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1c3a94a-8ffc-4448-8d9c-31d75a32644e\">poached from Milan-based <strong>Versace</strong></a>, is due to take the reins of the British fashion house on Friday at a big moment for the company. Former chief executive Marco Gobbetti had introduced a strategy to move the brand upmarket, and had achieved some success but sales were undermined by pandemic restrictions on travel, which prevented Burberry's key Chinese customers coming to Europe to buy new outfits.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>UK, household disposable income and inequality data plus the Treasury committee is to question chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Office for Budget Responsibility on last week's Spring Statement.
