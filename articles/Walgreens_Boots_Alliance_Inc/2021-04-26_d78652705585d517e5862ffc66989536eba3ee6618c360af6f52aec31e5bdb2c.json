  "text": "<p>   Health officials around the country resumed offering Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine this weekend after getting a green light from federal regulators on Friday. </p><p>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted their recommendation to pause the shots after investigating reports of rare but potentially dangerous blood clotting in certain recipients. On Friday, FDA and CDC officials said inoculations could continue because their benefits outweigh their risks. </p><p>   The FDA issued updated informational guides that inform vaccine recipients and doctors of the risk of blood-clotting that primarily has affected adult women under 50. The overall risk is about 1.9 cases per million people, though the risk is about 3.5 times higher for women ages 18 to 49, officials said. </p><p>   The Indiana Department of Health said it began administering the J&amp;J shot on Saturday to adults age 18 and up at a mass vaccination site at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The site administered 2,515 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine on Saturday and an additional 1,325 doses through late afternoon on Sunday, said a spokesman for Indiana University Health, which is helping run the site. </p><p>    Florida started offering the shots again on Sunday at federally supported vaccination sites in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville and Miami, said the state's Division of Emergency Management. </p><p>   A mass vaccination site at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, N.Y., opened appointments for residents to get the J&amp;J shot on Sunday after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city would immediately restart using the vaccines. </p><p>   Some officials said it could take a few days to schedule appointments but welcomed the return of J&amp;J's vaccine after last week's pause sent states scrambling to reschedule thousands of appointments. </p><p>   \"It does have some advantages over the other vaccines in particular populations where it may be difficult to give them a second shot,\" said Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer at Northwell Health. \"We really need to have multiple options out there to have people comfortable to get vaccinated so we can get to herd immunity.\" </p><p>   Pharmacy chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. said they would restart vaccinations with the J&amp;J shot this week. </p><p>   Arizona's health department said it had advised healthcare providers in the state to resume offering the J&amp;J shot, of which the state has nearly 105,000 doses. The Minnesota Department of Health said the state had distributed 9,600 doses of the vaccine to healthcare providers that it expects to be available to the public in the coming days. </p><p>   J&amp;J's shot achieves immunity with one shot rather than two as required for Pfizer Inc.'s and Moderna Inc.'s vaccines. J&amp;J's shot is easier to keep refrigerated and for longer periods. </p><p>   States and hospitals are taking advantage of the simpler dosing to vaccinate people who are less likely or able to return for a second shot, such as those who are homeless, people who travel frequently for business and older people confined to their homes. </p><p>   Northwell, based in New Hyde Park, N.Y., likely will resume offering the J&amp;J shot once it updates the informational materials it provides to patients to include a warning about blood clots and once it educates its doctors and nurses on how to communicate the risk to patients, particularly women under 50 years old, Dr. Stefas said. </p><p></p>",
