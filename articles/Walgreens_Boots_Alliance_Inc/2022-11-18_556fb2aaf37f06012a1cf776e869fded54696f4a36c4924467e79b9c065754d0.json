  "title": "Elizabeth Holmes Is Sentenced to 11.25 Years in Prison for Defrauding Theranos Investors; Jury convicted Holmes in January on charges that she misrepresented startup's technology, finances and business to investors",
  "text": "<p>Judge Davila ordered Ms. Holmes to serve 135 months, or 11.25 years, and to surrender on April 27, 2023. The sentence length is in the midrange of those received by the dozen white-collar criminals with similar offenses cited by the government in its sentencing memorandum.</p><p>The government lawyers who prosecuted Ms. Holmes asked for a 15-year prison sentence, a 3-year supervised release and $804 million in restitution, the sum that they said Theranos defrauded from later-stage investors, certain business partners and a board director. In a court filing, prosecutors cited \"the depravity of Ms. Holmes's lies\" and her \"blind ambition\" that they said would continue to inflict harm on others.</p><p>In tearful remarks to the court before learning her fate, Ms. Holmes said she was full of regret and that, looking back, there were many decisions she would have made differently.</p><p>\"I am devastated by my failings,\" she said. \"Everyday for the past years I have felt deep pain for what people went through because I failed them.\"</p><p>Judge Davila said he would schedule a hearing to discuss restitution.</p><p>Before delivering the sentence, he referenced the honest entrepreneurial spirit of the Northern California region's historic agricultural economy that eventually gave way to the technology juggernaut of modern Silicon Valley. He also said he took into consideration letters he received from venture capitalists who reminded him that failure in the startup world isn't uncommon.</p><p>\"But they didn't endorse failure by fraud,\" he said. \"Those letter writers did not condone misrepresentation and manipulation.\"</p><p>Ms. Holmes has 14 days to appeal her conviction; her lawyers will seek to let her stay out of prison pending her appeal.</p><p>The former CEO embraced her parents and her partner, Billy Evans, in the courtroom after the details of her punishment were read. She shares a child with Mr. Evans and is expecting another.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's lawyers declined to comment. Her parents also declined to comment. The U.S. Attorney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Ms. Holmes had sought home confinement and community service, and no more than 18 months in prison. Her lawyers, in their request for leniency, positioned the 38-year-old as a caring friend and loving mother with a toddler at home and a second child on the way, whose incarceration would only prove detrimental to her family and community.</p><p>In her statement, Ms. Holmes apologized to the Theranos employees and patients affected by Theranos's failings. She said she would make the world a better place through her teachings to her children, and to focus on helping people in need.</p><p>\"I gave everything I had to building our company and saving our company,\" Ms. Holmes said. \"I regret my failings with every cell in my body.\"</p><p>Ms. Holmes founded and ran Theranos as chief executive for close to 15 years, touting a technology solution to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. The case featured one of the most high-profile criminal fraud trials in years amid a decadeslong decline in white-collar prosecutions.</p><p>Her prosecution followed a series of Wall Street Journal articles starting in 2015 that called into question Ms. Holmes's claims about the Theranos technology. The saga led to a bestselling book, an award-winning Hulu series and a planned movie.</p><p>Her sentence is a remarkable outcome for a startup executive buoyed by Silicon Valley's fake-it-until-you-make-it culture, in which a founder's vision and bravado are often the biggest draws of attention and money. Over the years, some have defended Ms. Holmes as no different from her startup founder peers who make the occasional exaggerated sales pitch.</p><p>In the case of Theranos, prosecutors showed that Ms. Holmes's hype and hubris went beyond acceptable norms, misleading investors with claims that unproven technology was ready for real-world use and risking patients' health by providing them with lab results that weren't reliable.</p><p>\"The fact that she was prosecuted, taken to trial and convicted goes a long way of sending a message to Silicon Valley about the line between puffery and sales pitches on the one hand, and material misrepresentations on the other,\" said Amanda Kramer, a former federal prosecutor in New York and attorney with Covington &amp; Burling LLP.</p><p>In court Friday, Judge Davila said he found enough evidence to determine there were at least 10 investors in Theranos who were victims of fraud, and that the total sum they were defrauded was $121.1 million.</p><p>His findings, which he said were based on U.S. sentencing guidelines and the facts of the case, come in much closer to defense's recommendations for the loss amount than the government's recommendation.</p><p>Judge Davila agreed with the defense that it wasn't fair to consider all investors in Theranos's 2013 and 2014 funding rounds as victims, as the government had recommended. Even if investors overpaid, the company stock wasn't worthless, and the value of the stock must be considered, he said.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's appeal could take many months or even years, said lawyers following the case. Ms. Holmes could challenge aspects including evidence the judge allowed in over the defense's objections or any possible sign of juror misconduct. No hints of juror misconduct have emerged, and the judge has been accommodating with arguments and requests from both sides, lawyers said. Judge Davila permitted a hearing earlier this month for Ms. Holmes to argue for a new trial; he ultimately denied her request.</p><p>Ms. Holmes, who dreamed up Theranos as a 19-year-old Stanford University student, claimed her startup's technology could cheaply and quickly run more than 200 health tests using a proprietary finger-prick blood-testing device that made large needles and vials of blood obsolete. At its peak, investors valued Theranos at more than $9 billion, the 10th largest among venture-capital-backed startup companies at the time.</p><p>The Testimony of Elizabeth Holmes</p><p>Ms. Holmes owned half of it, with a paper value of around $4.5 billion, she testified during her trial. With Ms. Holmes's marketing skills and a star-studded board of Washington insiders, Theranos raised about $945 million from investors.</p><p>The monthslong trial showed a different reality. The company managed to use its proprietary blood-testing device for just 12 types of patient tests. Those results were unreliable. At its lab, Theranos secretly ran most of its blood tests on commercial devices from other companies, including some that Theranos altered to work with tiny blood samples.</p><p>Jurors learned during the trial that Ms. Holmes forged reports provided to some investors and partners such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s U.S. drugstore unit by adding logos of Pfizer Inc. and other major drug companies without permission from the companies. Prosecutors showed in court how text had been deleted and added to the documents, which some investors said in testimony made them appear to them to be complimentary validation reports, which they weren't.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is the sentence for Elizabeth Holmes a fair one? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Despite Theranos's problems, Ms. Holmes and her top deputy and ex-boyfriend, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, showed investors projections of annual revenue that at one point was supposed to reach $990 million, when the real number was $500,000, and boasted of a partnership with the military to put Theranos devices on medevacs. There was no such partnership, according to evidence presented in trial.</p><p>\"Elizabeth Holmes lied to me about saving soldiers' lives through military contracts,\" investor Craig Hall, whose firm put about $5 million into Theranos, wrote in a letter to the court to advocate for a tough sentence, according to a government filing. \"Simply put, Holmes's actions were loathsome and un-American.\"</p><p>In her testimony, Ms. Holmes repeatedly said she had regret for some of her mistakes but never intended to mislead anyone: \"There are many things that I wish I did differently.\"</p><p>Marc Vartabedian contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes Is Sentenced to 11.25 Years in Prison for Defrauding Theranos Investors</p>",
