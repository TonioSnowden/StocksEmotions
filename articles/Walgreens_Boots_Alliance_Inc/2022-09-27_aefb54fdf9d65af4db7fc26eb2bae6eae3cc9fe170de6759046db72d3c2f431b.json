  "text": "<p>Altfest's screen was designed to help investors identify potential stocks for long-term investments — that is, for commitments of several years, at least — with some implied downside protection. Any stock screen is only a first step for your own consideration of companies' less tangible quality factors.</p><p>Here's a year-to-date price chart to illustrate the broad market's action before and after we did the first screen:</p><p>From the previous closing low on June 16, the S&amp;P 500 rose 17% through Aug. 16. Then it took a 15% flop through Sept. 26, hitting its lowest closing level since Dec. 14, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Read: The Dow just joined the S&amp;P 500 in a bear market: What investors need to know</p><p>First, we'll lay out the criteria, with results from a new screen as of the close on Sept. 26. Then we'll summarize changes to the list and show how the June 29 list has performed, even though the intention of the first screen wasn't to \"pick winners\" for a period of less than three months.</p><p>New dividend-stock screen</p><p>Here are the screening criteria, with the number of companies meeting each among the S&amp;P 500:</p><p>* Beta for the past 12 months of 1.00 or less, when compared with the price movement of the entire index: 298 companies. For this screen, a beta of less than 1 indicates a stock's price has been less volatile than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.</p><p>* Dividend yield of at least 3.50%: 78 companies.</p><p>* Expected earnings per share for 2024 increasing at least 4% from 2023, based on estimates among analysts polled by FactSet: 50 companies.</p><p>* Expected sales for 2024 increasing at least 4% from 2023: 22 companies. We are using calendar-year estimates for earnings and sales; many companies have fiscal years that don't match the calendar.</p><p>Here are the 22 companies identified by the new screen, sorted by dividend yield: </p><p> Company                                Ticker  Dividend yield  Expected increase in EPS – 2024  Expected increase in sales – 2024  12-month beta  On June 29 list?
