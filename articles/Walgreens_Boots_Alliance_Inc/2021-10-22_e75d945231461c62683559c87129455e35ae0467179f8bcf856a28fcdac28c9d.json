  "text": "<p>Pediatricians, schools and pharmacies are preparing to host Covid-19 vaccination clinics for millions of children, in what will be the largest vaccine effort since initial doses for adults went out almost a year ago.</p><p>States and federal officials say they anticipate thousands of doctors' offices will administer most of the vaccines when eligibility expands to 28 million children between 5 and 11, should regulators allow the shots. Most states including Colorado, Oklahoma and Virginia are also setting up thousands of clinics at schools and community-health facilities, while some states will put vaccines at places frequented by families such as museums.</p><p>Pharmacists, who normally don't give vaccines to children in many states, will also help, after Congress granted them permission to administer Covid-19 vaccines to most children during the pandemic. CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. expect to offer the vaccine, as do community pharmacies.</p><p>Federal officials and states are planning for a rollout that could get under way in early to mid-November. The two-dose vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE. is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Facing no supply concerns and having honed Covid-19 vaccine distribution over the past year, state and public-health officials say they anticipate a smoother rollout than with adults, when early demand outstripped supply, overwhelming pharmacies and other providers. These officials also are encouraged by how the pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be shipped in smaller packages than the doses for adults and can be refrigerated for up to 10 weeks instead of needing ultracold freezers that most doctors' offices lack.</p><p>As a result, practices can use more doses before they expire, reducing potential waste.</p><p>\"This is going to be logistically a little bit easier than it was with the adults,\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.</p><p>Still, state and public-health officials say thousands of doctors and nurses who haven't yet given Covid-19 vaccines will need to learn how to order and administer the shots. Another challenge is predicting how many parents will vaccinate their children. Polls show many parents haven't decided. About one-third of 217 parents of children 5 to 11 years old surveyed recently by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they plan to wait to see how the shot performs before inoculating their children.</p><p>States are weighing where to send vaccines based on whether parents are comfortable sending their children to get vaccinated at school with permission slips or want to discuss the shot with a healthcare worker before making decisions. Some states are surveying doctors' offices about administering vaccines and helping them sign onto Covid-19 vaccination programs.</p><p>Virginia expects only about one-quarter of its schools to offer on-site vaccination, citing communities that are vaccine hesitant and schools that have limited staff, said Danny Avula, the state's vaccination liaison. He predicted about half of the 723,000 eligible children in the state will be vaccinated in the first few months.</p><p>\"I don't think the uptake will be that significant,\" Dr. Avula said.</p><p>The vaccine appeared to safely generate a robust immune response in children 5 to 11 years in a Phase 3 trial, according to the drugmakers.</p><p>An advisory panel to the FDA meets Tuesday to discuss the Pfizer clinical trial data for the children, and an FDA decision could come within days. Then, after an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meets and issues a recommendation, distribution could begin.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech are furthest ahead with development of a vaccine for children under 12 years old. Moderna Inc. is conducting a clinical trial while Johnson &amp; Johnson has yet to begin one.</p><p>Some children's hospitals will offer vaccines and join with community and religious groups, according to federal officials. Most hospitals, which played a major role during the initial U.S. vaccination rollout, will sit out pediatric vaccinations because they are short-staffed and overwhelmed due to recent surges in Covid-19 patients, public-health officials said.</p><p>Rhode Island plans to initially offer vaccines to about 80,000 children at sites such as doctors' offices, and a mass vaccination site, Gov. Daniel McKee said. Rhode Island is also asking municipalities to hold at least two Covid-19 clinics for children by the end of the year, replicating a strategy with adults that drove high vaccination rates, he said.</p><p>Providence Children's Museum will be a vaccination site, providing child-friendly activities during the 15-minute post-vaccination period when children are monitored, Mr. McKee said.</p><p>Many schools are used to administering vaccines, particularly in rural areas. The Juneau, Alaska, school district plans to place vaccine clinics in elementary schools. Shots will be given after school hours to make the process more convenient.</p><p>\"We'll continue to have clinics until we see demand go down,\" said Kristin Bartlett, chief of staff at Juneau School District.</p><p>In Gorham, Maine, superintendent Heather Perry is considering bringing in the school mascot, a ram, to vaccine clinics to entertain children.</p><p>MaineHealth, the state's largest hospital system, is working with school districts to administer the shots. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer, said the system plans to give shots in gymnasiums. She said one of her best tricks is singing a slow version of \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\" with children nervous about getting shots.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
