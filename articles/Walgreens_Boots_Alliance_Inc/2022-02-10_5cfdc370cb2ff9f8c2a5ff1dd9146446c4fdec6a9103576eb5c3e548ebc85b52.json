  "title": "Business News: Covid-19 Vaccines, Tests Boost CVS --- Drugstore chain is evaluating acquisitions to expand its reach into health services",
  "text": "<p>Covid-19 vaccinations, in-store testing and take-home test kits made up about 35% of operating profit for CVS's retail segment in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company posted earnings of $1.98 a share, beating analyst expectations of $1.83 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>The company maintained its guidance for the current year of adjusted earnings of $8.10 to $8.30 a share, saying that benefits from Covid-19-related sales could wane, especially in the second half of 2022. On a conference call with investors, executives said they didn't expect the authorization of a new Covid-19 booster shot this year.</p><p>CVS stock fell more than 5% in Wednesday trading, the biggest decline among S&amp;P 500 companies. \"Given that CVS maintained the '22 guidance range despite the large Covid benefit this quarter, in our view, the Covid benefit is likely to moderate,\" said analyst Steve Valiquette at Barclays.</p><p>For the current year, CVS expects vaccine volume to fall 70% to 80% versus last year and in-store Covid-19 testing to fall 40% to 50%, Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin told analysts on the conference call. It expects to sell more at-home tests in 2022 compared with the previous year, he said.</p><p>CVS executives say they have won over new customers throughout the pandemic and they expect some of those shoppers to stick around. \"We have seen a lot more traffic in the stores and that's manifesting itself in more prescriptions\" and spending, Mr. Guertin said.</p><p>CVS, drugstore rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., grocery chains and big-box stores such as Walmart Inc. have played prominent roles in the U.S. effort to distribute Covid-19 vaccinations across the country. Many have also been crucial to the federal effort to make available rapid, at-home Covid-19 tests, which were outstripped by demand in the latest quarter as Americans sought to get tested around the holidays.</p><p>Before the pandemic, CVS and other drugstores were struggling to fend off a growing number of online rivals. Covid-19 has proved a welcome tailwind. Now CVS is in the midst of trying to remake itself as a broad healthcare provider. The retailer said last year it would close about 900 of its roughly 10,000 stores over three years and open more primary-care clinics.</p><p>CVS plans to transition locations into three types: primary-care clinics, so-called health hubs that offer more routine health services and retail pharmacies, Chief Executive Karen Lynch said Wednesday. The company has said it aims to hire more doctors to bring that plan to life. CVS is also evaluating acquisition options in the space, Ms. Lynch said.</p><p>CVS is initially targeting primary-care providers, she said. The company's preference is finding regional or national service providers and groups with experience in working with patients enrolled in Medicare plans. \"We won't be able to scale fast enough if we do onesie, twosies,\" Ms. Lynch said, referring to smaller, local practices.</p><p>Ms. Lynch said CVS also has an interest in other health services, including home health.</p><p>Staffing shortages have stressed CVS and Walgreens as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have sought to juggle Covid-19 testing and vaccines with filling prescriptions and serving customers.</p><p>The retailer had significant hiring through the year, Ms. Lynch said, including a one-day virtual event that attracted 45,000 new workers.</p><p>Last year, CVS said it would raise starting wages for workers to $15 an hour by this July.</p><p>The Woonsocket, R.I.-based company has seen its costs rise, in part because of wage increases, along with its sales over the past year.</p><p>For the three months ended Dec. 31, CVS said sales in its retail business rose 13% from a year earlier to $27.11 billion.</p><p>The company posted a quarterly profit of $1.31 billion, or 98 cents a share, up from $973 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue, which includes CVS's health-insurance and pharmacy-services businesses, increased 10% from a year earlier to $76.6 billion, the company said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected sales of $75.66 billion.</p><p>CVS's fourth-quarter results included an impairment charge of $1.4 billion related to the company's store-closure plan.</p><p>---</p><p>Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
