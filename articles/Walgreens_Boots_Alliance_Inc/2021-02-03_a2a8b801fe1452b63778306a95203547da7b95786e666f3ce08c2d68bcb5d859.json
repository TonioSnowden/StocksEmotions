  "text": "<p>Mr. Zients also announced the first phase of a federal program starting Feb. 11 that will deliver vaccines directly to certain pharmacies.</p><p>\"This will provide more sites for people to get vaccinated in their communities,\" he said during a White House briefing on the administration's Covid-19 response. \"And it's an important component to delivering vaccines equitably.\"</p><p>Most major retail pharmacy and grocery chains will participate in the effort, including ones operated by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., CVS Health Corp., Kroger Co. and Walmart Inc.</p><p>Acknowledging vaccine supply constraints, Mr. Zients said the program would be limited in the first phase, with a million doses being allocated to 6,500 stores next week.</p><p>Mr. Zients said the additional one million doses to pharmacies \"is consistent with Moderna and Pfizer scaling their operations.\"</p><p>On eligibility requirements at pharmacies, since each state has its own policy, Mr. Zients said each state will need to check on its requirements but reiterated that President Biden has called on states to open vaccination to those 65 and older.</p><p>The Trump administration in November announced a vaccination partnership with large chain pharmacies and networks that represent independent pharmacies and regional chains. The plan included a few thousand pharmacies in the beginning, later expanding to about 40,000 pharmacy sites. The Trump administration said in early January it was accelerating the plan.</p><p>State leaders tasked with the vaccine-administration effort have called for additional supply, with some on the verge of running out as they have accelerated their rollout.</p><p>The pharmacy effort will expand, but in its initial phase will focus on providing vaccines to communities most at risk of severe illness, with states working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on initial pharmacy partnerships, administration officials said.</p><p>\"Equity is at the core\" of how they are selected in order to reach populations most at risk, Mr. Zients said, adding that the CDC will monitor the initial phase of the pharmacy vaccinations.</p>",
