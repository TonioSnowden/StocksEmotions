  "text": "<p>Most Americans still think of Walgreens and CVS as a place to pick up a prescription and maybe some Hallmark cards. Both companies want to become their medical providers, too.</p><p>That explains why earlier this week a unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance pushed deeper into medical practices, just two months after CVS Health Corp. agreed to buy home-healthcare company Signify Health for $8 billion. For CVS, which already owns a pharmacy-benefits manager and insurance giant Aetna, now isn't the time to take its foot off the accelerator, despite pressure to focus on buying back shares.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc.'s sporadic but determinedforays into healthcare, which include the recent acquisition of a chain of primary-care centers, is one reason to move quickly. Just as important is the long-term opportunity as an aging American population leads to growth in Medicare Advantage enrollment, which is shifting providers into value-based reimbursement models. This largely explains the race to acquire your local doctor's office. While your family doctor might have belonged to a small practice, chances are he or she is part of a bigger group now as consolidation in the primary-care space heats up.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think CVS will be able to catch up to UnitedHealth Group? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The obvious model for CVS-Aetna, as well as other insurers seeking to bulk up their medical businesses, is UnitedHealth Group Inc. Through its medical-provider arm, Optum Care, it has been buying multi-specialty physician practices, and it now counts 60,000 physicians in 2,000 locations. Optum's rapid growth doubly benefits UnitedHealthâ€”first by boosting the group's overall growth, and because keeping patients relatively healthy reduces costs for those covered by the group's insurance arm. UnitedHealth's strategy has helped it outperform its peers, making it the seventh most valuable company in the U.S. with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion.</p><p>The Signify deal was the first significant step in CVS Chief Executive Officer Karen Lynch's plan to remake the company as a care provider. During a conference last year, she told investors that \"partnering with the consumer on their lifelong healthcare journey requires continuous presence that seamlessly blends digital and analog interactions.\"</p><p>CVS already provides limited healthcare services through its MinuteClinics and HealthHub stores. Now the company is on the hunt for doctors, with plans to have more than 200 centers across the country in coming years. A key challenge is figuring out just what sort of acquisition makes most sense. CVS reportedly backed out of buying One Medical, which Amazon snapped up. More recently, The Wall Street Journal reported CVS was in talks to acquireCano Health Inc., which operates primary-care centers, though some outlets reported CVS backed out of that as well. For a company with plenty of real estate already, physician enablement companies like Privia Health Group Inc. and Agilon Health Inc., which partner with doctors but don't actually own or lease physical space, could make more sense.</p><p>The pressure to use limited cash for buybacks is strong, though. CVS shares fell sharply in October to below $90 at one point due to a decline in the quality rating of one of its Medicare Advantage plans, which is expected to hurt earnings in 2024. It later lost out on a pharmacy-benefit-manager contract with Centene Corp. Instead of reducing its profit outlook, management in the most recent earnings call vowed to buy back shares more aggressively to stay on track, helping to lift the stock back above $100. Focusing squarely on juicing earnings per share while healthcare is being remade feels like missing the forest for the trees.</p><p>Lisa Gill, a JP Morgan healthcare analyst and a longtime CVS bull, wrote in a note recently that \"it is more important for CVS to make the right acquisition that will meaningfully advance its long-term strategy as opposed to hitting a near-term earnings target.\"</p><p>In its recent earnings call, CVS management argued it could do both. Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin acknowledged that at the current valuation \"a deal is likely less accretive than share repurchase,\" but he noted that the company can use \"balance sheet capacity\" for the right strategic deal.</p><p>That is far from a given. CVS generates a lot of cash but took on a large amount of debt to finance the $69 billion acquisition of Aetna in 2018. It therefore has limited wiggle room if it wants to keep its investment-grade rating. Shareholders would be better served if management delivered a slight profit disappointment in the short term to seize the long-term healthcare opportunity along with its rivals.</p><p>Write to David Wainer at david.wainer@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Has Little Time to Waste as Amazon, Walgreens Ink Doctor Deals</p>",
