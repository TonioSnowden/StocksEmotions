  "text": "<p>   Indoor visits will soon be able to resume at some New Jersey nursing homes as novel coronavirus cases continue to decrease, public-health officials said. </p><p>   The New Jersey Department of Health has notified long-term-care facilities in seven counties where there has been moderate Covid-19 activity that they can resume indoor visitations with social distancing after they prove they meet certain requirements, said Judith Persichilli, commissioner of the department, during a news conference Wednesday. </p><p>   Those requirements include no active cases for 14 days and sufficient staff and personal protective equipment. </p><p>   The counties where long-term-care facilities are now eligible for indoor visits are Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem, said Ms. Persichilli. </p><p>   \"This is good news. We are seeing outbreaks in our long-term-care facilities decrease,\" Ms. Persichilli said. </p><p>   Vaccinations are also continuing at long-term-care facilities across the state, Ms. Persichilli said. </p><p>   So far, the federal effort to administer inoculations at nursing homes led by CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has resulted in more than 230,000 long-term-care residents and staff in New Jersey getting vaccinated, she said. </p><p>   Overall, the state has administered 1.76 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. </p><p>   New Jersey's seven-day average of Covid-19 cases was 2,934 on Tuesday, one of the lowest figures since mid-November. There were 2,070 people hospitalized on Tuesday with Covid-19 or probable cases, the lowest level since mid-November. </p><p>   Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the falling infection rates mean restaurants would be permitted to raise their indoor dining capacity to 50% \"sooner rather than later.\" </p><p>   The new variants of Covid-19, however, could complicate the easing of additional restrictions, depending on the infection rates, he added. </p><p>   In New York, the daily positivity rate for Covid-19 tests on Tuesday fell to 2.85%, the lowest level since November 21. There were also 5,876 people hospitalized with Covid-19 in the state on Tuesday. </p><p>   \"New Yorkers have shown courage and fortitude in the face of this unprecedented pandemic, and it's thanks to them that we're seeing a decline in hospitalizations and in the Covid positivity rate,\" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. </p><p></p>",
