  "title": "U.S. stock futures mixed after Fed-inspired Nasdaq retreat",
  "text": "<p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 rose 71 points, or 0.2%, to 36,362.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 edged down 1.5 points, or less than 0.1%, to 4,691.</p><p>Futures on the Nasdaq-100 NQ00 fell 81.25 points, or 0.5%, to 15,685.25.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow industrials DJIA fell 392 points, or 1.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP skidded 3.3%. For the Nasdaq, it was the worst one-day percentage drop since Feb. 25.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Markets were rocked by the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in mid-December, which showed officials not only talked about quicker and more frequent interest-rate hikes but also about a more aggressive wind down of its $8.9 trillion balance sheet than the last time it reduced it.</p><p>“Clearly, the Fed is going to raise rates. The Fed is going to normalize the portfolio,” said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on Fox Business Network. “It's just how quick or how fast they do it. And, look, I think, 18 months from now, we will be sitting with 3% 10-year Treasury.”</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 1.74% early on Thursday.</p><p>Growth stocks suffered more pain. The ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, a proxy for highly speculative tech companies, slumped over 7% on Wednesday.</p><p>“Growth companies had been the main beneficiaries of extraordinarily low real and nominal interest rates, which pushed valuations to elevated levels. As the Fed begins to normalize policy, it's logical that these stocks will face the strongest headwinds, similar to what we saw on Wednesday. Within the U.S. equity market, we continue to have a preference for value stocks over growth stocks,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS.</p><p>Futures remained mixed after data showed first-time jobless claims rose slightly last week to 207,000, but remained near a 52-week low. Claims rose from a revised 200,000 in the previous week. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected initial claims to total a seasonally adjusted 195,000 in the seven days ended Jan. 1.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.BBBY initially tumbled in premarket trade after the retail company reported a surprise fiscal third-quarter loss and sales that missed expectations. But shares bounced back and were up more than 8% in recent action.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.WBA shares rose more than 4% after the pharmacy retailer reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat expectations and raised its full-year guidance.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed.</p><p>Oil futures saw strong gains, with the U.S. benchmark CL00 up 2.5% after finishing Wednesday at a six-week high. Gold futures GC00 fell 1.9%.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD was down 1.5%.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP fell 1.1%, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX declined 0.7%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP fell 0.3%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 0.7% and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK dropped 2.9%.</p>",
