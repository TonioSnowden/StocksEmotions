  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Starbucks Has a Tall Order For Howard Schultz --- The CEO is back for his third stint running the coffee giant. But as drive-through orders have replaced lingering over espresso, it's a very different company from the one he built.",
  "text": "<p>That transformation, accelerated by the pandemic, has sparked an identity crisis for the 51-year-old chain, and a host of problems for its cafes. It also has kicked off an unusual management saga in which the company's powerful early leader considers remaking the strategies of his successors. Mr. Schultz must now decide how much to rewrite the playbook that made Starbucks a global phenomenon.</p><p>Cafes designed to sell espresso to people lingering inside now dispense iced coffee through drive-through windows to customers lined up in cars. Workers have grown frustrated by changing procedures, hours and customer demands, circumstances that were exacerbated by pandemic worker shortages that often left some cafes understaffed. Worker dissatisfaction has spawned a unionization push, with more than 200 of the company's 9,000 U.S. locations filing to be represented by the Starbucks Workers United union.</p><p>During an internal forum with U.S. store leaders this month, Mr. Schultz said he had returned to fix things. \"I wasn't here the last four years, but I'm here now,\" he said.</p><p>He promised to focus on employees, cafes and customers, not shareholders, scrapping billions of dollars in share buybacks to invest in operations. \"I am not in business, as a shareholder of Starbucks, to make every single decision based on the stock price for the quarter,\" he said. \"Those days, ladies and gentlemen, are over.\"</p><p>By some measures, Starbucks is more successful than ever. By the quarter ended March 28, 2021, sales had already bounced back from early in the pandemic. The company reported record revenue for the fiscal year ended Oct. 3, and its earnings of $4.2 billion were the second-highest ever. Starbucks, the largest coffee chain in the world by sales and number of locations, aims to open thousands of new cafes by the end of the decade, many overseas.</p><p>But Starbucks's shares have fallen 32% in the last 12 months, while a Standard &amp; Poor's index of restaurant stocks was down 6% during the period. Its stock fell last October when it announced that average hourly wages would rise to $17 an hour by this summer, and again in February when it reduced its forecast for its earnings and store margins during its current fiscal year because of inflation, labor costs and continuing disruptions stemming from the virus.</p><p>Operations at some stores have become a struggle. Baristas juggle coffee requests coming in through drive-through windows, mobile devices and for delivery, a challenge for a chain that also scores workers on their ability to connect with customers. Many cite persistent problems with the ice machines, which frequently break and are too small to meet the demand for cold drinks.</p><p>Since returning as CEO, Mr. Schultz has expressed wonder that the company he founded to serve espresso now mostly sells iced drinks to go.</p><p>\"The third-place environment, which has been such a foundational aspect of the Starbucks experience all over the world, is now somewhat confined by the fact that people are not using our stores the same way,\" he said in an address to employees at Starbucks headquarters on April 4, his first day back. Starbucks should reconsider its business model, he said, thinking beyond coffee and cafes, maybe even to branded nonfungible tokens.</p><p>\"We have to redefine the design, our store experience, and with that comes a significant level of investment,\" he said. \"We're going to create new segments of business that are not solely dependent on our stores.\"</p><p>Mr. Schultz has already made changes in the executive ranks. He brought back longtime confidants in advisory roles, including former Starbucks communications chief Vivek Varma and Cliff Burrows, who led past efforts such as the development of Starbucks's upscale Roastery stores. The company's general counsel, appointed by Mr. Schultz's predecessor, departed on the second day of Mr. Schultz's new tenure. Mr. Schultz hired a new senior executive specializing in worker relations, Frank Britt, to act as the company's chief strategy officer.</p><p>Mr. Schultz's third stint running Starbucks wasn't planned. His first tour as CEO had ended in 2000 when he handed the reins to Chief Operating Officer Orin Smith, who was followed by Jim Donald in 2005. Sales began to falter in the mid-2000s and were hit hard by the 2008 economic downturn, prompting Mr. Schultz to return for a second stint that year. He stepped down again in 2017, turning over leadership to Kevin Johnson, and explored an independent U.S. presidential bid. He decided against running, then occupied himself with philanthropy and entrepreneurial efforts.</p><p>Starbucks remained on his mind, he has said. He maintained ties to the board, including to Chairwoman Mellody Hobson, a Chicago asset manager who has called Mr. Schultz a mentor and friend. He remained one of Starbucks's biggest shareholders, with 21.6 million shares held directly and through family trusts, accounting for roughly 2% of its total stock, according to a securities filing.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, his successor, streamlined parts of the business and focused on increasing efficiency, particularly through to-go ordering through the company app. That approach boosted sales, but some former executives said the company lost touch with its people-focused culture. Workers noticed an increasing focus on speed metrics, including the average time to prepare an order, by store. Some workers complained about increasing pressure.</p><p>The pandemic badly hurt Starbucks's business, curbing sales and increasing expenses once cafes began reopening. To-go sales helped it perform better than many competitors, but the recovery was bumpy.</p><p>Mr. Johnson said he had signaled to the board in 2021 that he wanted to retire after the pandemic eased. Rosalind Brewer, Mr. Johnson's second in command, had been seen internally as Starbucks's future CEO. But she left Starbucks in early 2021 to become CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. Starbucks had no immediate replacement for her, later promoting veteran executives to take on her operational responsibilities.</p><p>Last November, although Mr. Schultz wasn't involved with the company in any official capacity, he met with cafe managers in Buffalo, N.Y., where workers were set to vote on unionization. The increasingly vocal union campaign had convinced him he should go, according to people familiar with his thinking. He addressed workers for an hour about the company's origins and its early investments in employee benefits, in an effort to persuade them not to unionize. Two of the three Buffalo stores later voted to unionize.</p><p>Later that month, Mr. Schultz gathered with former colleagues at a Seattle-area golf club to memorialize the late John \"Jack\" Rodgers, a Seattle businessman who made an early investment in the coffee chain. According to people who were there, Mr. Schultz reminisced about the chain's early days and worried about the union drive and what it meant for the company.</p><p>By February of this year, Mr. Schultz had become increasingly occupied with Starbucks's challenges, said the people familiar with his thinking. Within weeks, he was telling confidants he was coming back.</p><p>Ms. Hobson, the chairwoman, said the board turned to Mr. Schultz to help steer the company at what she described as an inflection point, describing him as the right messenger at this time. \"Is there any chance Howard would stay for good, good?\" she said in an interview. \"Zero. It'll be a short-term assignment.\"</p><p>She said the new CEO, among other things, needs to tackle the current workplace issues and \"the innovation piece of who we are and what we are. . . . So we need someone who has vision.\"</p><p>As interim CEO and a member of the board, Mr. Schultz will help select his successor. Ms. Hobson said Starbucks formed a committee some time ago and has been considering permanent CEO candidates, but the pandemic has constrained its search.</p><p>Former executives who remain close to the chain don't expect Mr. Schultz to bow out entirely by the fall, as Starbucks has said he intends to do. Mr. Schultz has also rejoined the company's board, and Starbucks hasn't said if that role is interim.</p><p>Some investors said they wondered who could or would be up to the task of running Starbucks next, with a strong-willed founder remaining involved. \"It's like mom watching over you,\" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at wealth-advisory firm Hightower Advisors LLC, which last owned Starbucks shares in 2021. \"Howard is a winner. But this is going to take time.\"</p><p>During Mr. Schultz's internal address on his first day back, some veteran employees expressed enthusiasm about his return on an internal chat board, saying the company had lost some of its direction and leadership in recent years.</p><p>\"I am in tears listening to you Howard,\" wrote one. \"Thank you for coming back and inspiring us all over again, we missed you!\"</p><p>Others have expressed concern that the company resorted to calling back its early leader to try to get back on track.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
