  "title": "Doctors Left to Decide Who Gets Extra Covid-19 Vaccines Amid Booster Debate; Physicians are making decisions about whose existing conditions qualify them to receive fresh doses",
  "text": "<p>Though her doctor believes she is at high risk and wrote a note to help her get vaccinated early in the rollout of shots in February, Ms. Boral isn't technically eligible for a booster yet. Currently, only patients with seriously compromised immune systems are cleared for the extra shots, such as people who have recently received an organ transplant, blood-cancer patients and those taking immunosuppressant drugs.</p><p>\"I would go out and get one immediately if I could,\" Ms. Boral said. \"I don't understand why our country is dragging its feet.\"</p><p>The Biden administration's plan to make boosters available to more people in the U.S. is in flux. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday endorsed booster shots of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE for adults 65 and older and those at high risk of severe disease. Some officials and researchers support additional vaccines for most people to bolster immunity against the virus. Others say boosters might only be necessary for now among certain groups like older and immunocompromised people.</p><p>The uncertainty is frustrating patients as physicians and pharmacists draw different conclusions about whether people in their care qualify for Covid-19 booster shots.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you received any guidance on Covid-19 boosters from your doctor or pharmacist? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some doctors say current guidelines exclude high-risk patients who might benefit from a booster, such as cancer survivors who recently completed a chemotherapy treatment or patients with a history of respiratory problems, like Ms. Boral.</p><p>\"There's a lot of gray area around how to define someone as moderately or severely immunocompromised,\" said David Cohn, an oncologist and chief medical officer at the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \"You kind of have to set a bar somewhere.\"</p><p>Some hospitals, including James Cancer, have begun contacting cancer patients and other people with compromised immune systems to schedule booster shot appointments.</p><p>\"Our goal is to make it as easy as possible\" to get a booster, Dr. Cohn said.</p><p>Other doctors and some public-health officials have said patients shouldn't seek booster shots until authorities can administer as many vaccines as possible to those who have declined to get vaccinated and to residents of developing nations where vaccine supplies remain limited.</p><p>World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this month that the body lacks sufficient data to recommend booster shots for healthy patients. He asked wealthy nations on Wednesday to hold off on administering boosters until the end of the year.</p><p>\"Starting with boosters, especially giving it to healthy populations, is really not right,\" Dr. Tedros said.</p><p>Booster shots have been available to immunocompromised people in the U.S. since mid-August, when the FDA authorized a third shot for patients over age 18 who had received a second dose at least 28 days earlier. Studies suggest that the vaccines' effectiveness has held up well against the highly contagious Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which became the dominant strain in the U.S. over the summer, but that protection wanes over time.</p><p>Some physicians are administering boosters only to patients who qualify under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's criteria, while others are giving boosters to other patients they determine to be at high risk. Some refer patients to pharmacies and other vaccination sites that might be strictly adhering to federal guidance for confirming a patient's booster eligibility.</p><p>Pharmacy chains like CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said they are offering booster shots to people who sign a form stating that they qualify for the shot because they are immunocompromised, based on the CDC's criteria.</p><p>The agency's list of qualifying patients includes those with advanced or untreated HIV infection, patients undergoing active cancer treatment and recent stem-cell-transplant recipients. Both chains said they aren't requiring patients to show documentation of their immunocompromised status.</p><p>Some doctors have said boosters should be given only when they are most effective, after immunity has waned, and in the most efficient dosages possible—both points that current data hasn't defined well yet. Most people should hold off on getting boosters until the data is more conclusive, said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at the Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University.</p><p>\"Most likely we are going to all need boosters at some point, because that's just how vaccines work. Immunity wanes. Viral mutations happen. But the question to me is at what point,\" Dr. Ranney said.</p><p>Lucy McBride, an internist in Washington, D.C., said she is generally following CDC and FDA guidelines on booster shots but that some patients' situations don't easily fit the government's recommendations. She cited examples of people who live with severely immunocompromised family members, or older people who work in areas of high community transmission—two situations where she said she would advise administering boosters.</p><p>\"Because the messaging has been so confusing and because the data is still evolving, we're basically asking patients and pharmacies to make their own decisions,\" said Dr. McBride. \"At the end of the day, it comes down to the person in front of me, and because the CDC can't possibly speak to every American, they have to draw these somewhat arbitrary lines in the sand.\"</p><p>Some patients, especially older Americans, are getting impatient. Richard Graus, a 78-year-old retired geologist from Front Royal, Va., said he has been wearing a mask indoors and monitoring the news to find out when he can get a third shot. The FDA panel's recommendation Friday means he is likely to get access to a booster soon.</p><p>\"I'm of an age where the immunity that I have is probably not as good as it was when I was younger,\" Mr. Graus said. \"I'm not desperate for it at this point, and I can wait another month if that's what it takes, but I don't want to have to be overly cautious for the rest of my life.\"</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Doctors Left to Decide Who Gets Extra Covid-19 Vaccines Amid Booster Debate</p>",
