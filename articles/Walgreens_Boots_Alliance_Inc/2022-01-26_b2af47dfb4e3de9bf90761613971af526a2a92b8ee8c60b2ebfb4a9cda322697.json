  "title": "When Should a Vaccinated Person Who Recovered From Covid-19 Get Boosted? It's Complicated; Physicians and health authorities say there isn't enough scientific evidence to give broad recommendations",
  "text": "<p>People who have received Covid-19 vaccinations but not boosters and have become infected are facing a difficult choice: when to get that additional dose.</p><p>While the Omicron variant spreads across the U.S., more vaccinated people are becoming infected than at any previous point in the pandemic. After recovery, some people are perplexed about what to do next.</p><p>A lack of official guidance from government health officials about when to get the booster has added to the confusion among these patients about whether—and when—they should line up for a booster shot.</p><p>Physicians and vaccine experts say that because there is limited scientific data to determine a time interval for a booster, timing should be individualized based on risk. They say generally most recovered vaccinated people can wait a few weeks before getting a third dose.</p><p>\"There's no reason to rush out and get that booster dose if you've had a recent illness with Covid,\" said Buddy Creech, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"You've got a period of at least eight to 12 weeks when you're going to be highly protected because of that recent infection, and therefore you may have some time before you have to receive the booster dose.\"</p><p>Physicians and researchers also say that waiting will ensure that the additional dose properly boosts the immune system.</p><p>The discussion over when people should get their booster shots has intensified as more people are confronted with the more transmissible Omicron variant.</p><p>As overall case counts rise during the Omicron surge, breakthroughs are also increasing. Recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the rate of vaccinated people testing positive in December was more than three times that at the Delta peak in late August—444 people per 100,000, compared with 132 per 100,000.</p><p>Unvaccinated people testing positive came in at 1,006 per 100,000 in December, compared with 683 per 100,000 in late August.</p><p>Vaccines were shown in clinical trials to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic disease, but the two-dose primary series has been found to be less effective against Omicron than in the case of earlier variants.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you plan to get a booster shot? Why, or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Boosters decrease the chances of an infection. Roughly 305 people per 100,000 had breakthrough infections in the week ended Dec. 25, according to another CDC data set, which pulled from fewer U.S. locations but separated out the booster impact. The rate in that data set for people who were vaccinated, but without boosters, was 512 people per 100,000.</p><p>As vaccinated but unboosted people become infected, they might be encountering different recommendations.</p><p>The CDC tells physicians that people who finished their primary series of shots and recovered from Covid-19 can get a booster once they are no longer isolating or quarantining, but that there is no minimum time for how soon after to get the additional dose.</p><p>\"We just don't want you to be waiting in line at Walgreens if you just tested positive that day because it would potentially put the staff at risk,\" CDC official Sara Oliver said during a recent meeting with the agency's outside panel of vaccine experts.</p><p>Pharmacies, where many people in the U.S. are receiving vaccinations, say they follow government guidance but they also ask that people take additional steps before getting a booster.</p><p>CVS Health Corp. asks that patients seeking boosters not have tested positive or experienced symptoms within two weeks, a spokesman said. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. asks patients to wait at least 10 days from when they started experiencing symptoms or had a positive test if asymptomatic, and if they had experienced symptoms, be symptom-free for at least 24 hours, the company said.</p><p>Doctors and researchers say the lack of a time interval might not matter for people who are at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 and should get a booster relatively soon once they clear the virus. \"The person who's elderly with a lot of comorbidities, I would err toward giving that booster dose,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's vaccine-research group.</p><p>For those who aren't at high risk, physicians suggest that many of them wait at least one month, possibly as many as three, before getting a booster, depending on their individual risk. They say these individuals likely have strong protection against infection—perhaps as long as three months—from antibodies and other immunity weapons that will combine with whatever was gleaned by vaccination, resulting in immunity seen by experts as more powerful than either alone.</p><p>A booster given too soon after an infection means the body won't distinguish it from the recent infection, and won't lead to a proper boost, said David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p>\"It's going to be hard to tell the difference between that vaccine [booster] and just some of the virus that was still sitting around,\" Dr. Dowdy said.</p><p>Waiting also could lessen the intensity of any uncomfortable side effects of getting vaccinated, such as chills, headache and fevers.</p><p>Another reason to wait is uncertainty of duration from mixing immunity from vaccines and infections, researchers say, pointing to limited data on long-term infection immunity and how the virus behaves differently in individuals.</p><p>An infection has shown to offer at least three months of protection against a repeat infection, and a subsequent booster protects even longer, but Dr. Creech said it is still unclear whether the duration of total protection changes if the booster is given immediately after infection.</p><p>Dr. Creech's Vanderbilt hospital system, which requires vaccinated healthcare workers to get boosters, permits them to seek a 90-day exemption from a positive Covid-19 test.</p><p>Physicians say another confusing aspect involves recovered vaccinated people who had received monoclonal antibody treatments. The CDC guidelines for physicians say people who have received monoclonal antibodies should wait about three months before receiving any Covid-19 vaccines, but doesn't distinguish between a primary vaccination series and boosters.</p><p>The CDC didn't respond to multiple requests for comment on this issue.</p><p>—Jon Kamp contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
