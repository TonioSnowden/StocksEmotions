  "text": "<p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is bracing for a recession and life after Covid.</p><p>The second-biggest U.S. drugstore chain by stores said Thursday that quarterly sales fell and earnings plunged as revenue from Covid-19 vaccinations dried up. The pharmacy chain also paid out a $683 million opioid settlement.</p><p>The Deerfield, Ill., company has relied on demand for Covid-19 tests and vaccines to power sales over the past year. Demand dropped off significantly in its fiscal third quarter, as Walgreens administered 4.7 million vaccinations, down from 11.8 million in the Omicron-driven prior quarter, the company said Thursday.</p><p>Executives said they are working to bolster profitability and gird against an economic downturn by further expanding the company's healthcare business and overhauling store offerings to prepare for a potential recession.</p><p>\"We see our customers making deliberate choices to prioritize overall value and convenience,\" Chief Executive Roz Brewer said on a call with analysts. \"There's a shift in calculus due to food and fuel inflation, but health and wellness will always be a priority.\"</p><p>The chain is adding hundreds of primary-care offices, expanding into home healthcare and launching a clinical-trial business in which it would use its troves of data to match patients with clinical trials and, in some cases, help conduct trials for pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Walgreens and its chief rival, CVS Health Corp., have for years been in a race to become go-to treatment centers, particularly for patients with costly, hard-to-manage chronic conditions.</p><p>For now, Walgreens's effort to transform itself into a healthcare provider is proving costly.</p><p>The company said it would be another year before its recently acquired primary-care business starts turning a profit, and hundreds of locations won't start making money for at least another two years. Walgreens last year agreed to acquire a controlling stake in primary-care network VillageMD and said it would add hundreds of locations in the next few years.</p><p>Meanwhile, a move away from tobacco products cost Walgreens 1 percentage point in sales, the company said. U.S. retail sales grew 1.4% in the quarter; excluding tobacco products, sales would have risen 2.4%.</p><p>The company said it is still trying to hire more employees to return about 3,000 stores to regular operating hours amid a shortage in pharmacists and pharmacy technicians that led many locations to cut hours.</p><p>It also is working to automate more filling of prescriptions through so-called micro-fulfillment centers, where an assembly line of robots fill pill bottles. The centers fill about 20% of store prescriptions, and Walgreens aims to grow that to 40% to 50% over time.</p><p>Ms. Brewer said the company is preparing for a recession in part by substantially expanding its private-label business. Demand for cheaper, private-label offerings is growing for consumer products from soda to soap as consumers cut costs amid soaring inflation, according to data tracking firms.</p><p>Overall sales at Walgreens for the period ended May 31 fell about 2% to $32.6 billion, largely on declining pharmacy sales. Retail sales rose slightly, helped by higher sales of at-home Covid tests.</p><p>The company reached a $683 million deal last month to resolve claims related to the distribution of prescription opioid medications in Florida.</p><p>Walgreens posted a quarterly profit of $289 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, Walgreens said adjusted earnings were 96 cents a share, 4 cents higher than analysts had expected, according to FactSet.</p><p>The company said investments in the growth of its Walgreens Health business also chipped away at its bottom line. Walgreens has been looking to expand into the healthcare industry, having acquired a major position last year in home-health benefits manager CareCentrix and VillageMD.</p><p>Walgreens, which backed its outlook for the year, earlier this week said that it would keep its Boots U.K. pharmacy chain and No7 Beauty Co. business after failing to receive adequate bids for the units. The company said market conditions had put a severe crimp on financing availability for potential buyers and it will instead focus on growing both businesses.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com and Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Walgreens Shifts Into Recession Mode as Covid Boom Fades</p>",
