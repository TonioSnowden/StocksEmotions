  "text": "<p>The counties argued that by enabling the opioid crisis, the pharmacy companies created a public nuisance. Each county said the crisis cost them about $1 billion in costs related to law enforcement, social services and courts.</p><p>The verdict in the bellwether case is being closely watched by attorneys elsewhere as similar cases play out against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors.</p><p>Plaintiffs attorneys for the counties issued a joint statement calling the verdict an \"overdue reckoning.\"</p><p>\"For decades, pharmacy chains have watched as the pills flowing out of their doors cause harm and failed to take action as required by law,\" the attorneys said. \"Instead, these companies responded by opening up more locations, flooding communities with pills, and facilitating the flow of opioids into an illegal, secondary market.\"</p><p>Michael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS Health Corp., said the company strongly disagreed with the verdict.</p><p>\"Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need,\" he said. \"We look forward to the appeals court review of this case, including the misapplication of public nuisance law.\"</p><p>Fraser Engerman, a spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said the company planned to appeal and believed that the court erred in allowing the case to go before a jury.</p><p>\"As we have said throughout this process, we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the 'pill mills' and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis,\" Mr. Engerman said in a statement. \"The plaintiffs' attempt to resolve the opioid crisis with an unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law is misguided and unsustainable.\"</p><p>Walmart Inc. also said it would appeal. \"Plaintiffs' attorneys sued Walmart in search of deep pockets while ignoring the real causes of the opioid crisisâ€”such as pill mill doctors, illegal drugs, and regulators asleep at the switch,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>Walmart also said plaintiffs' lawyers \"wrongly claimed pharmacists must second-guess doctors in a way the law never intended.\"</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com</p><p>Walgreens, Walmart and CVS Pharmacies Contributed to Opioid Epidemic, Ohio Jury Finds</p>",
