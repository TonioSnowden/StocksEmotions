  "title": "Prosecutors Make Final Arguments Against Former Theranos President; Government attorney says Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani gave investors false financial projections; 'The house of cards crumbles'",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Balwani willingly collaborated with Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, his girlfriend for more than a decade, to cheat investors and patients in a bid to keep the floundering startup afloat, Mr. Schenk said. He did this by luring investors with lies about the company, including inflated revenue projections, and approving marketing materials that touted Theranos tests as accurate, despite knowing they were anything but, Mr. Schenk said.</p><p>\"Theranos was running out of money and Mr. Balwani had a choice to make,\" Mr. Schenk told the jury. \"He could watch Theranos fail. He could watch his girlfriend's business collapse or he could pursue a different path.\" And that path was fraud because Theranos \"would not generate any revenue by being honest with people,\" Mr. Schenk said.</p><p>Mr. Balwani, age 57, faces 12 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Ms. Holmes, who was Theranos's founder, was convicted in January of four counts of fraud. She awaits sentencing in September. The pair were indicted together in June 2018, three months before the company dissolved, but U.S. District Judge Edward Davila ordered the trials severed in March 2020.</p><p>The closing arguments come 13 weeks after the start of Mr. Balwani's trial, which has been beset by delays due to the pandemic affecting jurors and others involved in the trial. The government called 24 witnesses to testify, including former employees, scientists, investors and patients.</p><p>Mr. Balwani's defense witnesses included a physician who walked back her confidence in Theranos tests while under cross-examination, and a technical consultant hired by the defense. Mr. Balwani didn't testify. Mr. Balwani's attorneys have said Theranos was created and controlled by Ms. Holmes, who owned 51% of company shares and founded the company about six years before he joined it, so any scheme to defraud would be Ms. Holmes's alone. They also said Theranos had hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank when Mr. Balwani left in 2016.</p><p>Mr. Balwani's attorney is expected to follow the government with closing arguments, which will likely continue Wednesday, after which the jury will begin deliberating Mr. Balwani's fate. Each fraud count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although such a severe sentence is unlikely in this case, lawyers have said.</p><p>Theranos claimed it could run almost 300 tests for health conditions using its proprietary technology, a miniaturized version of commercial blood analyzers that required only a finger prick of blood. In reality, it could perform just 12 tests on its own devices, and ran another 27 on modified commercial analyzers that the company hid from investors, prosecutors said.</p><p>To secure a conviction, the government must prove that Mr. Balwani knowingly participated in a fraud scheme, that the scheme was devised to obtain money from investors and patients, that the lies he told were material to Theranos obtaining that money, and that Mr. Balwani had the intent to defraud.</p><p>Mr. Schenk, the assistant U.S. attorney, sought to show that Mr. Balwani held tremendous power and influence at Theranos and was a true partner to Ms. Holmes. He displayed to the jury a text message Mr. Balwani sent Ms. Holmes in July 2015: \"I am responsible for everything at Theranos. All have been my decisions too.\"</p><p>During the trial, former employees testified that the pair ran Thearnos in tandem. \"I considered Mr. Balwani and Elizabeth to be unified in all of their decision-making processes,\" Mark Pandori, former Theranos lab director who reported to Mr. Balwani, said in his testimony in March.</p><p>Dr. Pandori testified that he told Mr. Balwani the company should stop using their proprietary testing device, called the Edison, because the results were unreliable. He said Mr. Balwani rebuffed him.</p><p>\"He had a temper and he showed it to a lot of people when he disagreed with them,\" Dr. Pandori testified.</p><p>In a text message he sent to Ms. Holmes in November 2014, Mr. Balwani called the lab a \"disaster zone.\" Ms. Holmes had given Mr. Balwani relatively free rein to run the lab, she testified in her own trial.</p><p>Another lab director testified during the trial that he ordered the company to stop performing a pregnancy hormone test on the Edison devices because the results were inaccurate, but Mr. Balwani rebuffed his concerns and the company continued to perform the test on its proprietary devices.</p><p>Mr. Schenk told the jury that Mr. Balwani was responsible for false information given to investors and to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., with whom Theranos had a partnership to offer its tests inside retail pharmacies. In one instance, investor Alan Eisenman, whose nearly $1 million investment underpins one of the counts of wire fraud, forwarded an analyst report to Mr. Balwani. The report said Theranos technology relied heavily on traditional needle-in-the-arm blood draws and its results took longer than advertised—which was true. But Mr. Balwani dismissed the report as incorrect.</p><p>\"What's fatal to fraud? The truth,\" Mr. Schenk said.</p><p>Mr. Balwani showed investors revenue projections in October 2014—with just two months of the year remaining—that said the company would make $140 million for the year. In reality, its revenue for that year was $150,000, according to a document shown in court.</p><p>\"It is only a matter of time before the house of cards crumbles and the financial projections never come true,\" Mr. Schenk said.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Prosecutors Make Final Arguments Against Former Theranos President</p>",
