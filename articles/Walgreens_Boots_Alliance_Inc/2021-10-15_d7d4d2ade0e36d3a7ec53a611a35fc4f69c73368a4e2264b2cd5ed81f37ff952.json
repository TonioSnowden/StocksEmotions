  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 rallied 74.46 points, or 1.7%, to 4438.26, marking the benchmark's largest one-day percentage gain since March 5. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 534.75 points, or 1.6%, to 34912.56. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 251.79 points, or 1.7%, to 14823.43.</p><p>The rally was broad-based. All of the S&amp;P 500's sectors rose, with materials and technology stocks leading the 11 groups. Just 25 companies in the benchmark index fell. Walgreens Boots Alliance notched the best performance in the index, gaining $3.51, or 7.4%, to $50.77 after the pharmacy chain reported a revenue boost and said it would acquire a controlling stake in primary-care network VillageMD, enabling it to open doctors' offices at hundreds of locations.</p><p>Other companies that reported earnings also saw big gains. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group gained $16.81, or 4.2%, to $420.36, after it raised its guidance for full-year earnings and recorded a jump in revenue due to higher premiums. Bank of America added $1.93, or 4.5%, to $45.07 after the bank said its third-quarter profit rose 58%.</p><p>Other banks also reported strong earnings, results that were largely rewarded by investors. Morgan Stanley gained $2.44, or 2.5%, to $101.01. Citigroup ticked up 54 cents, or 0.8%, to $70.80. Wells Fargo, in contrast, fell 74 cents, or 1.6%, to $45.31.</p><p>Money-managers and strategists said Thursday's rally doesn't necessarily mean that the U.S. stock market has turned a corner. Many expect more uncertainty in the months ahead. Still, with bond yields so low and few other places for strong, consistent returns, many remain bullish on stocks.</p><p>\"We don't think any of these problems are going to end the bull market,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"I think this is a natural period of consolidation and volatility and that it's completely normal as part of any economic recovery.\"</p><p>In bond markets, where yields fall when bond prices rise, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.519% from 1.549% Wednesday, providing some relief to growth and technology stocks. Western Digital, a maker of hard disk drives, added $2.34, or 4.3%, to $56.55. PayPal gained $10.09, or 3.9%, to finish at $266.45.</p><p>Economic data were also a bright spot Thursday. U.S. jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 9 fell to 293,000 from 329,000 the week prior -- the first time they have fallen below 300,000 since the pandemic began.</p><p>Meanwhile, fresh data from the Labor Department also showed that the prices that suppliers are charging businesses and other customers cooled slightly in September from the month before, despite remaining historically high. The department's producer-price index rose 0.5% last month, down from 0.7% in August and lower than the 0.6% rise expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Oil prices rallied. Futures for Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 1% to $84 a barrel, their highest settle value since October 2018. U.S. crude futures climbed 1.1% to $81.31 a barrel, closing at their highest level since October 2014.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.2%. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was up 1.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.7% and Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 was up 0.5%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.3%.</p>",
