  "title": "Should You Get a Covid-19 Vaccine Booster Shot? What to Know; Questions and answers on issues such as how well boosters protect against the Omicron variant and who is eligible",
  "text": "<p>Extra doses of vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson are cleared for people at least 18 years old. And people can get booster shots that are different from their first vaccine doses.</p><p>Health authorities have been recommending boosters because preliminary research suggests they are needed to maintain a strong level of immune protection against the Omicron variant.</p><p>Here is what we know about the need for boosters.</p><p>What is a booster shot?</p><p>It is an extra dose of the vaccine. In the case of the messenger RNA vaccines, it is a third dose. The extra dose mobilizes your body's immune-system defenses further to protect against Covid-19, health authorities say. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said early testing indicates a booster shot given at least six months after the second vaccine dose produces antibody levels five to 10 times higher than after two doses. Johnson &amp; Johnson said, in announcing it had asked the FDA to authorize a booster, that the shot increased the protection of the company's one-dose vaccine to 94% in the U.S.</p><p>Should I get a booster shot?</p><p>With its latest move Jan. 5, the CDC now recommends that anyone 12 years old or older should get the additional shot after completing a first course of Covid-19 vaccination, especially given the threat of the Omicron variant.</p><p>\"As we face an increase in Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, it is critical that our younger people have access to additional doses of the vaccine that will maximize their protection,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said.</p><p>Health authorities also now recommend that many children 5 to 11 years year old who have weakened immune systems also get the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. Research suggests that people with weakened immune systems may not get enough protection without the extra dose.</p><p>Anyone who initially received a Pfizer-BioNTech shot and is eligible for a booster shot may now have it administered at least five months after they received their second dose.</p><p>Moderna boosters were made available to people 18 and up who are at least six months past their second shot.</p><p>Adults who got the J&amp;J single-dose vaccine had already been authorized to get a booster at least two months after their shot.</p><p>An extra Covid-19 vaccine dose could mobilize more antibodies against the coronavirus, though the evidence supporting an additional dose isn't definitive. The immune system is complicated, involving more than antibodies. Other studies evaluating any benefit from an extra dose are still under way.</p><p>A number of countries have been rolling out boosters. Israel has made them available to people 12 years and older. In Europe, France and the U.K. have started giving boosters to older people and those with compromised immune systems. The European Medicines Agency has recommended boosters for adults.</p><p>Where can I get the booster shot?</p><p>Getting the booster is similar to getting the initial course of vaccination, federal health officials said. The vaccines are available at some 80,000 locations around the U.S., including retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as mass-vaccination sites and doctors' offices. The Biden administration and Pfizer have said there is enough supply for the boosters, which are available at no cost to people in the U.S.</p><p>Should I get a booster now, or wait until there's a new vaccine targeting Omicron?</p><p>Doctors recommend getting a booster now rather than waiting. Even if the booster is less effective at preventing severe disease or hospitalization against Omicron than against earlier variants, doctors expect boosters to provide at least some protection against Omicron.</p><p>Moderna said on Dec. 20 that preliminary results from initial lab tests found that a third dose of their vaccine increased immune responses against the Omicron variant compared with two doses, suggesting that a booster could help protect against the new strain.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech have similarly reported early findings that indicate that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests, but the two-dose regimen was significantly less effective at blocking the virus. Still, the two-dose regimen may prove effective in preventing severe illness from Covid-19, the companies said.</p><p>The FDA is prepared for the possibility of Omicron-targeting vaccines, but it is unclear so far whether one will ultimately be necessary, said Peter Marks, who heads the agency's vaccine center.</p><p>The development of an Omicron-specific booster is expected to take at least three months, and there could be manufacturing or authorization delays beyond that. Waiting would leave people more exposed in the meantime.</p><p>Researchers previously said the current vaccines appear to work well against variants of concern that have emerged before Omicron. Yet they might not work as strongly against newer variants as they do against earlier ones. For that reason, people might want booster shots to ensure that they get the fullest level of protection possible against the variants. And they would want a third shot if any variants emerge that prove better able to evade current vaccines. Drugmakers are working on shots targeting variants.</p><p>Is it safe for me to get a booster shot from a different vaccine brand?</p><p>The CDC backed booster mixing and matching on Oct. 21, saying people can get a shot that is different from what they had received previously.</p><p>For immunocompromised people who already are authorized to get a third messenger RNA dose, the CDC says they should try to get the same type of vaccine as their first two shots but can mix and match if they have to.</p><p>The CDC's recommendation follows the FDA's authorization of mixing and matching on Oct. 20.</p><p>The permission to mix and match vaccines and boosters would help ensure doses are available to anyone who wants one, while also increasing options for fully vaccinated people, according to health authorities.</p><p>The FDA's mixing-and-matching decision was informed by a National Institutes of Health study that showed that receiving a different vaccine than the original one received boosted antibody levels across all three vaccine types, particularly among Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients.</p><p>The NIH study showed that J&amp;J vaccine recipients boosted with a Moderna dose saw a 76-fold increase in antibody levels, while a Pfizer booster increased antibody levels 35-fold and a J&amp;J dose increased antibody levels fourfold.</p><p>I got Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. What does this mean for me?</p><p>Any adult who got a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson at least two months after the single-dose shot, according to the FDA.</p><p>Advisers to the FDA had voted unanimously Oct. 15 to recommend the agency authorize an extra dose of J&amp;J, to shore up protection against the coronavirus.</p><p>The panel of outside doctors and experts voted to recommend that all adults who received a first dose of the J&amp;J vaccine should get the second dose at least two months later.</p><p>The committee members opted not to take a vote on whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get the J&amp;J booster shot, saying that evidence was too limited.</p><p>J&amp;J said studies found the booster increased protection. An international study, in which subjects received two doses of its vaccine, 56 days apart, found the two-dose series was 75% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 disease overall, and 94% effective in the U.S. portion of the study. And the two-dose series was 100% effective against severe to critical cases, J&amp;J said.</p><p>J&amp;J also said studies found that the second dose boosted levels of immune-system agents known as antibodies significantly in the weeks following the booster.</p><p>I've been vaccinated and had Covid-19. Does a booster shot make sense for me?</p><p>People who both had Covid-19 and are vaccinated don't need to rush to get the boosters now rolling out across the U.S., health experts say.</p><p>Several studies suggest that people who have had Covid-19 and were fully vaccinated have strong protection, including against variants, and probably don't need the boost. Such research is preliminary and data is incomplete, according to scientists who specialize in vaccines and immunology. More is known about people who had Covid-19 and then were vaccinated, scientists said, than those who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections.</p><p>Can I get the flu vaccine and a Covid-19 booster shot at the same time?</p><p>The CDC says that flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines can be given together. It also recommends that everyone age 6 months and older receive a flu shot by the end of October because flu activity peaks December through February. Health experts have warned that the coming flu season is on track to be worse than the last cycle as Covid-19 restrictions that also helped prevent the spread of the flu virus are eased.</p><p>What about people with weakened immune systems?</p><p>The FDA had already authorized the additional dose for certain people with compromised immune systems. Research shows that immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19, are more likely to transmit it to household contacts and more likely to have breakthrough infections.</p><p>The immunocompromised include transplant recipients, some cancer survivors and people living with HIV; their weakened immune systems make them less responsive to vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to provide protection. The elderly also tend to have weaker immune systems, and they are also likely candidates for boosters.</p><p>Why wouldn't Covid-19 immunity last?</p><p>Studies suggest and many researchers say the immunity provided by Covid-19 vaccines will wane over time.</p><p>The vaccines work by generating neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating.</p><p>Pfizer has said that antibody levels start to decline from their earlier peaks about eight months after the second dose. After a third shot, antibody levels were up more than five times among people age 18 to 55 and more than 11 times in people age 65 to 85, compared with two doses, according to Pfizer's data.</p><p>Even with reduced antibodies, vaccines are protecting against severe disease, according to researchers and published research. That is because the vaccines help other immune-system weapons: the T-cells that hunt down infected cells and destroy them, and memory B-cells, which circulate in the blood and help churn out antibodies upon detecting a virus. Both are likely helping prevent severe disease, according to researchers.</p><p>Peter Loftus and Sumathi Reddy contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com and Jared S.
