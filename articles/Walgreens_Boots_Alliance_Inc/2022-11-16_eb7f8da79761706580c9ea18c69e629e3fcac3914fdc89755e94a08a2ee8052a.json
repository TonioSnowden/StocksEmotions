  "text": "<p>    Walmart Inc. agreed to pay $3.1 billion to settle opioid-crisis lawsuits brought by several U.S. states and municipalities, adding to a landmark settlement with rival pharmacy chains. </p><p>   The agreement resolves a collection of lawsuits brought by states, cities and Native American tribes. Earlier this month, CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. agreed to pay roughly $5 billion apiece to settle the lawsuits. The companies didn't admit wrongdoing in their deals. </p><p>   The Walmart agreement was announced the same morning that the retail giant reported its latest quarterly results. The company said it took $3.3 billion in charges in the last quarter related to opioid settlements. It reported stronger-than-expected sales in the October-ended quarter and raised sales and profit goals for the year, signs the big discount chain is drawing in shoppers despite high inflation. Walmart shares rose 6.6%. </p><p>   Each state, local government and tribe will need to decide whether to participate in the settlement. Walmart said it strongly disputes allegations in the lawsuits and the settlement isn't an admission of liability. </p><p></p>",
