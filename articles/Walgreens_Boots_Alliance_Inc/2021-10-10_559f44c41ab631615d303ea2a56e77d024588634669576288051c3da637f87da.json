  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>We are all a lot more aware about the need to look after ourselves these days — a very thin silver lining to a pandemic — and this week a lot of people are looking to do just that.</p> <p>Firstly, there is a glut of marathons, both those that were delayed, such as Paris, and the Boston event, normally run each year in the spring, on Patriots' Day, but this year postponed until the Columbus Day public holiday. If you enjoy a gruelling run — like the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acdd72fc-cab9-459e-ada6-77ab2df6c30a\">FT's Laura Noonan</a> — there are more than 300 to choose from in October, more than any other month this year, according to online tracker Global Marathon.</p> <p>For those concerned about what they eat (or rather should not eat), prepare yourselves for Anti-McDonald's Day on Saturday. Then there is the growing trend for Covid passports, coming into force in Wales on Monday and Brussels on Friday, measures that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e94ff2e-6bf0-442c-be60-385ffc393f53\">divide societies</a>. Stay safe.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>After a profit warning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4904701-61bf-46c6-b6a6-311ce895767a\">wiped 15 per cent from Boohoo's market value last month</a>, investors will be watching closely the full-year results from rival Asos on Thursday. The two online fashion retailers serve slightly different markets, and Asos has the benefit of already having distribution infrastructure in the US and Europe. </p> <p>But cost pressures are mounting in the supply chain and competition is increasing — both from reopened bricks-and-mortar retailers and online rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d079978-65f4-47b8-a572-ed1f7b6a8e61\">China's SheIn</a>. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profit of £180m on sales of £3.92bn, and more detail on future strategy at an accompanying capital markets day.</p> <p>It is the first flush of banking results season. Goldman Sachs, reporting third-quarter earnings on Friday, is a bellwether for investment banking, an industry <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a67e0300-98a8-4e29-890a-0949135933ba\">thriving on the mergers and acquisitions boom</a>. </p> <p>JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday will provide a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49f2a28d-15f4-47d2-b037-d98c6bc3d124\">broader outlook on loan demand</a> (which has been soft) and overall consumer spending, which has recovered but could be under threat from the coronavirus Delta variant. </p> <p>If BlackRock's results on Wednesday interest you, you should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfd1e3d-e256-4656-a96d-1204538d75cd\">read this</a>.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>The two key items on the UK's economic agenda this week will be the labour market figures on Tuesday and, 24 hours later, the August gross domestic product estimate, giving us a better guide to what is happening behind the headline news of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3893aa1-432c-4071-ba6c-251be116e10a\">HGV driver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30edf029-e121-43d5-9653-3cc7bbdc318c\">abattoir worker shortages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/940e0ba1-485e-4a70-ba29-a966087b6f3b\">upward pressure on wages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b955bd40-b750-4d1c-98a6-9b719bed0e19\">a return to 1970s economics</a>.</p> <p>Hopefully, they will be more uplifting than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57ed92ab-994b-4fed-b422-518a0562c698\">last Friday's US non-farm payroll data</a> — apologies, by the way, to those of you who did not feel enough was made about this last week, but thank you for the emails. Keep them coming to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/global-inflation\">Inflation</a> will again be a topic on conversation
