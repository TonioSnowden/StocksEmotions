  "title": "U.S. News: Vaccine Push Spurs Demand For Virus Tests",
  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp . and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc . have begun limiting the number of at-home tests customers can buy online or in stores as they work with test suppliers to ensure they are able to meet demand.</p><p>Meanwhile, employers are having a tougher time securing bulk tests to screen employees as retail pharmacies and other testing providers ration supplies, according to consulting group Mercer LLC .</p><p>A repeat of last summer's crippling delays in Covid-19 test results appears unlikely, laboratories and medical professionals say, given that U.S. labs expanded operations last year and more types of tests are available. As Covid-19 peaked in many states last summer and fall, many people in coronavirus hot spots waited weeks for results.</p><p>As of Sept. 6, laboratories in the U.S. were processing more than 1.2 million daily Covid-19 tests that hunt for the virus's genetic material, federal data show. At the height of demand last fall and winter, labs processed more than 2 million such tests a day.</p><p>The most common type of Covid-19 laboratory test performed is done using a technique called a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.</p><p>Many laboratories have excess testing capacity. Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings can run about 300,000 Covid-19 tests a day and is currently using less than half of that capacity, said Adam Schechter , LabCorp 's president and chief executive.</p><p>\"If all the unvaccinated individuals decided to opt for weekly testing, it might be a stretch. And if that all comes in on Mondays, that too would be a touch more difficult from a load-balancing standpoint,\" said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratory at the University of Washington Medical Center. \"But I'd anticipate more people getting vaccinated, so I think we will be OK.\"</p><p>For rapid antigen tests, which hunt for pieces of virus protein and give results in about 15 minutes, demand already has started to outstrip the available supply of the tests themselves recently. Abbott Laboratories , a key supplier of such tests, scaled down its operations after demand plummeted in the summer, and the company is currently working on scaling its manufacturing back up and hiring additional employees.</p>",
