  "title": "As Kids Under 5 Start Getting the Covid-19 Vaccine, Parents Struggle to Find Appointments; Nearly 20 million children 6 months to under 5 years of age are newly eligible for the vaccine",
  "text": "<p>\"We want him to be as protected as he can as soon as possible,\" Ms. Carvill said.</p><p>Federal health authorities on Saturday recommended Moderna Inc.'s two-dose vaccine as well as a three-dose regimen by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE for children as young as 6 months. It was a moment some parents and caregivers had been eagerly awaiting, yet some of them haven't managed to book appointments for their children, while others are holding off.</p><p>Ashira Konigsburg, who lives on the Upper West Side in New York City, emailed her pediatrician last Friday to secure an appointment for her 3-year-old daughter for this week. She was unsuccessful.</p><p>\"It's been a saga,\" she said. \"They are not sure when their doses are being delivered, but it's happening later this week.\" Ms. Konigsburg was able to secure an appointment for her daughter at Walgreens next week, but is still trying to find an earlier appointment.</p><p>\"If it's this hard for someone who is motivated to get their kid vaccinated, I'm worried about someone who is less motivated. It's a lot of barriers,\" Ms. Konigsburg said.</p><p>For Blake Strickland of Seattle, Wash., the Covid-19 vaccines seem unnecessary for his children. He and his wife don't intend to get their 1-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son vaccinated. \"We're not antivaccine. Our kids got their other vaccinations. But we feel like Covid is endemic now and it's part of life,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Strickland, who is vaccinated, said his children got Covid-19 in March. His daughter was asymptomatic, but his son had a bad cough and fever, though the symptoms were short-lived.</p><p>\"That was kind of scary,\" Mr. Strickland said. \"If our doctor recommended the vaccine, we'd think about it but we're not in a rush to get it. The kids already got Covid, so if they're going to have long-term effects from it, we can't avoid that now.\"</p><p>Some children have experienced delayed or long-term effects from Covid-19, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome or MIS-C. While children are less likely to get severely sick from Covid-19, severe illness and death among children is possible. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said this month that more than 30,000 children under 5 have been hospitalized with the virus and more than 440 have died in the U.S. The vaccines could have prevented these outcomes, Dr. Murthy said.</p><p>Vaccines provide the best protection against getting Covid-19, even if a child has been previously infected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.</p><p>Public health experts have expressed concerns that the uptake of the vaccine among children under 5 will be as low or lower than the rate of vaccination among older children. Just over one-third of children aged 5 to 11 have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>An April poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority of parents of children under 5 either didn't intend to vaccinate their children if the vaccines were authorized or said they would take a wait-and-see approach. About 18% of parents surveyed said they would get their children vaccinated right away when a vaccine was authorized, while about one-quarter said they would definitely not vaccinate their child. Nearly 20 million children from 6 months to under 5 years of age are newly eligible for vaccination.</p><p>Some families may find it challenging to locate a place that can administer the vaccine. The White House has said the shots would be available through children's hospitals and health systems, as well as public-health clinics, community health centers and pharmacies, among other locations. But the nation's pharmacy chains will have a more limited role in rolling out vaccines to the youngest children than in previous rollouts. Pharmacists are permitted to vaccinate children three and older, under a federal emergency preparedness act.</p><p>CVS Health Corp. said it would offer vaccines only at locations with Minute Clinics, which are staffed with medical professionals authorized to vaccinate children younger than 3, such as a physician associate or nurse practitioner. CVS said its clinics will have vaccines for children aged 18 months and older. About 1,100 of CVS's 9,900 locations have clinics.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said it planned to offer vaccines to children 3 and older at about half its locations, or 4,150 stores, starting as soon as Saturday. Rite Aid Corp., with about 2,400 U.S. locations, said it planned to start offering vaccines to children 3 and older later this week.</p><p>Susie Cagle, of Alameda, Calif., said Tuesday that she had tried all morning to make a vaccine appointment for her 19-month-old son, but couldn't get through to her pediatrician's office.</p><p>\"The pediatrician had told us that they'd be ready to go once vaccines were authorized for under-5s. But I don't know if they're ready or not because I can't get through on the phone. I can't even get through to get on hold,\" Ms. Cagle said. \"It feels anticlimactic after all this waiting. Everything's not ready to go.\"</p><p>In Florida, government officials didn't preorder Covid-19 vaccines for children under 5. Gov. Ron DeSantis's administration has said it doesn't recommend that the vaccine be administered to young children who are healthy. Doctors in the state, however, were allowed, starting Friday, to order the vaccine, but the doses will likely arrive in Florida later than any other state.</p><p>President Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited a vaccination clinic in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday and spoke to children, local officials and healthcare workers who were administering Covid-19 doses to young children.</p><p>\"Let's be clear: Elected officials shouldn't get in the way and make it more difficult for parents who want their children to be vaccinated, who want to protect them and those around them. This is no time for politics,\" Mr. Biden said.</p><p>Some parents said they were worried about the side effects of the vaccines and wouldn't vaccinate their young children.</p><p>\"I'm not that confident of what the side effects may be, if it's going to be the right choice for them,\" said Satia Timmons, who has six children, including a 10-year-old son and a 2-year-old nephew whom she recently adopted. Ms. Timmons, who is vaccinated and lives in Sunrise, Fla., said she wouldn't vaccinate the younger children.</p><p>Claudia Mora, whose son is 2, said she, too, is concerned about side effects but said she intended to vaccinate her son as soon as possible.</p><p>\"I'm a vaccine believer but he's my first child and there have been some instances of children having high fevers and seizures from the vaccines,\" said Ms. Mora, who lives in Brooklyn. \"Would that be a reason not to vaccinate him? No. But I do think about it.\"</p><p>The CDC has assured parents that the vaccines are safe for young children. Side effects for the shots, which are administered at much smaller doses than those given to adults, were mostly mild or moderate, according to clinical trial data. Side effects included discomfort at the injection site, irritability and fever. Overall, the CDC said serious adverse effects were rare. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends Covid-19 vaccines for all pediatric patients from 6 months on who don't have contraindications to receiving a shot.</p><p>Sharon Terlep, Lizeth Beltran, Jon Kamp and Tarini Parti contributed to this article.</p><p>As Kids Under 5 Start Getting the Covid-19 Vaccine, Parents Struggle to Find Appointments</p>",
