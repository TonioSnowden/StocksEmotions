  "text": "<p>CVS administered about six million Covid-19 vaccines in its most recent quarter, down from about 17 million vaccines in the year-ago quarter and more than eight million in the first three months of the year.</p><p>Total pharmacy claims in the period grew almost 4% on a 30-day equivalent basis. The company said its performance was bolstered by new business and an extended cough, cold and flu season, which helped offset a decrease in Covid-19 vaccinations.</p><p>Retail sales were bolstered by higher prices and increased prescription and front-store volume, which included at-home Covid-19 testing kits. Same-store sales, or sales at locations open more than a year, were up 8% compared with the year-ago quarter.</p><p>The company, alongside rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., grocery chains and big-box stores such as Walmart Inc., has played a critical role in the nationwide effort to combat Covid-19.</p><p>CVS Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said the company expects $3 billion in revenue this year from a combination of Covid-19 vaccines and tests, down 33% from 2021. He said that is \"indicative of the endemic tail of Covid on our retail business.\"</p><p>The company raised its full-year per-share earnings guidance to between $7.23 and $7.43, up from its previous view of between $6.93 and $7.13. On an adjusted basis, the company now expects full-year earnings of between $8.40 and $8.60, up from between $8.20 and $8.40.</p><p>Full-year revenue is now expected to be between $307 billion and $312 billion, the company said, up $2 billion from its prior projected range.</p><p>The raised outlook comes as the company reported that net income for the quarter ended June 30 rose to $3 billion, or $2.23 a share, from $2.8 billion, or $2.10 a share, in the previous year.</p><p>Stripping out one-time costs, per-share earnings were $2.40. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting adjusted per-share earnings of $2.18.</p><p>Revenue came in at $80.6 billion, ahead of analyst expectations for $76.4 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>CVS shares rose 4.8% Wednesday and are down 3.2% this year.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
