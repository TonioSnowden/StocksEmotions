  "text": "<p>Investors are watching earnings to gauge the impact of stickier-than-expected inflation, rising energy prices, supply-chain disruptions and anticipated interest rate increases over the next two years.</p><p>\"Can companies weather those risks or was the entire rally only fueled by ultraloose monetary policy?\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research. Investors are looking to see \"where are we in terms of the post-lockdown cycle and also to get some insights into how solid earnings and companies are going into this tapering period and this era of somewhat higher interest rates.\"</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Bank of America gained 2.6% after its third-quarter profit rose 58% from a year earlier. Shares of UnitedHealth Group added 2.7% after it raised its guidance for full-year earnings, and held steady its expectations for how Covid-19 would affect this year's results.</p><p>Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance rose 2.4% after posting a profit rise, as its pharmacy and retail businesses in the U.S. grew, and recovery continued in the U.K. as Covid-19 restrictions eased.</p><p>Futures for Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 1.4% to $84.31 a barrel. Futures for gas to be delivered in the Netherlands—the European benchmark—gained 5.4% to 98.70 euros per megawatt-hour, equivalent to about $112.11.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.523% Thursday, from 1.549% Wednesday.
