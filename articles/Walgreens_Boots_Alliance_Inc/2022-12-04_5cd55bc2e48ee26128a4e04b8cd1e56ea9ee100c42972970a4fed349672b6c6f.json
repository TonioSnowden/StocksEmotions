  "title": "CVS Tries Out Remote System to Help Fill Prescriptions; Some pharmacists check pill counts and handle other tasks from miles away",
  "text": "<p>The largest U.S. pharmacy chain by revenue said its initiative, which began this past summer in Arizona, will lighten the workload for store pharmacists and free them up to provide customers with a wider range of services, such as vaccinations and health screenings. The plan doesn't involve changes to how people pick up their prescribed medications from CVS pharmacies.</p><p>Some practitioners, however, have concerns about whether CVS's plan will ultimately improve service or working conditions for pharmacists amid chronic short staffing. State regulations also present some barriers for the company to further execute its plan.</p><p>\"It's really a way to make the processing of prescriptions much more efficient,\" CVS Chief Executive Karen Lynch said in an interview.</p><p>CVS and rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are struggling to stop an exodus of drugstore pharmacists by offering measures such as bonuses, higher pay and guaranteed lunch breaks. Pharmacists were already in short supply before the pandemic; demand for Covid-19 shots and tests coupled with a nationwide labor shortage exacerbated the problem.</p><p>Walgreens, with nearly 9,000 U.S. locations, has said shortages of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians led it to reduce hours at roughly one-third of its stores, cutting into revenue and frustrating customers. The chain is rolling out a network of automated, centralized drug-filling centers, which the company says will reduce pharmacists' workload.</p><p>The CVS initiative is a step toward pharmacists' eventually carrying out crucial tasks such as verifying pill counts in physical bottles from remote locations, something that most state pharmacy boards currently don't allow, executives said. In that scenario, pills would be placed by a pharmacy technician on a specialized tray, which uses weight to register pill count, and that information along with images of the prescription would be beamed to a pharmacist, who could be working at another store or a central location.</p><p>The scope of CVS's rollout is limited in part by state regulations that require drugstores to have a certain number pharmacists on site or prohibit remote drug verification, the company said. Those rules vary by state, and most states bar pharmacists from working remotely.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think the efficiency of remote prescription verification will improve patient care? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>CVS is operating essentially all of its stores on regular hours, and the worker shortage isn't costing the company revenue, said Prem Shah, CVS's chief pharmacy officer.</p><p>But Mr. Shah said staffing remains a concern, with many pharmacists still overworked and fewer people attending pharmacy schools. Meanwhile, he said, pharmacists are leaving drugstores to work in hospitals or other jobs.</p><p>The number of pharmacy-school applicants has dropped by more than one-third from its peak a decade ago, according to the Pharmacy College Application Service, a centralized pharmacy-school application service.</p><p>\"We have to win them back by creating a better environment,\" Mr. Shah said. \"We're really looking inward on how we deliver pharmacy care in our country.\"</p><p>Richard Dang, president of the California Pharmacists Association, said he supports the idea of freeing up pharmacists to do more advanced clinical services but is skeptical that remote prescription verification will reduce pharmacists' workload or improve patient care. And he worries that such a system ultimately won't result in more resources for pharmacists.</p><p>\"Historically, the larger companies haven't shown a dedication in increasing personnel,\" Mr. Dang said. \"It really depends on how it will be built up and implemented. If you verify remotely, you're losing tactile, in-person verification of the color of the pill, or the pill count. It leaves room for some error.\"</p><p>Pharmacist-free drugstores aren't CVS's goal, Mr. Shah said, though the company is looking at whether pharmacies, in some cases, would be able to operate at times with no pharmacists on staff.</p><p>The larger aim is to improve workflow, both to ease pharmacist workloads and to better manage store traffic and staffing levels, Mr. Shah said. For instance, after Hurricane Ian caused widespread damage in southwest Florida in September, pharmacists from unaffected CVS locations were able to remotely assist hard-hit stores in verifying prescriptions, he said.</p><p>CVS plans to equip all of its stores with technology to review and enter prescription information remotely by next year, the company said.</p><p>Pharmacists' time is also increasingly valuable, Mr. Shah said, as they become able to administer a wider range of medical services. CVS is betting that those additional services could generate substantial revenue and draw more customers into stores. Covid testing and vaccinations generated billions in revenue for CVS and Walgreens earlier in the pandemic, but demand has fallen sharply this year.</p><p>CVS said last month that its pharmacists are now able to evaluate and prescribe Paxlovid, an oral antiviral treatment, to Covid-positive patients. Walgreens has begun enlisting pharmacists and pharmacist technicians to test for the flu by swabbing for the virus. And Kentucky's board of pharmacy recently approved a noninvasive colorectal cancer-screening protocol that can be performed by pharmacists.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Tries Out Remote System to Help Fill Prescriptions</p>",
