  "title": "Panera Bread Scraps IPO Deal With Danny Meyer's SPAC; Restaurant chain cites deteriorating capital-market conditions in delaying its plans to go public",
  "text": "<p>The two sides on Friday said that the agreement lapsed and wouldn't be renewed.</p><p>\"The deterioration of capital market conditions over the last several months has led to the realization that an IPO may not be imminent, and as a result we felt it was appropriate not to extend our planned partnership,\" Panera Brands Chief Executive Niren Chaudhary said. He added that the company will continue to prepare for and explore a public offering.</p><p>Mr. Meyer's SPAC said it would continue to search for another merger partner. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, have no operations and are designed to merge with private companies in order to take them public.</p><p>It is the latest in a string of deals to be called off in recent weeks as it gets harder for companies to secure financing amid rising interest rates and the broader swoon in stock markets.</p><p>Earlier Friday, Kohl's Corp. called off its sale to Franchise Group Inc. amid rising interest rates and an uncertain retail environment. And earlier this week, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said it would keep its Boots and No7 Beauty Co. businesses after failing to receive adequate bids.</p><p>A number of deals involving SPACs, which exploded in popularity in mid-2020 and through 2021, have also fizzled of late. According to data from Dealogic, more than two dozen U.S. SPACs that announced plans to merge with private businesses have since called off their plans this year, while others have withdrawn plans for IPOs.</p><p>JAB Holding Co., a European investment firm that is the majority investor in Panera Brands, declined to comment.</p><p>Panera Bread Co. was a public company for more than 25 years until 2017, when it was bought by JAB to add to its expanding consumer portfolio. The deal for nearly 2,000 cafes was valued at roughly $7.2 billion at the time, excluding debt.</p><p>JAB has been transforming its portfolio of coffee and food brands in recent years. It took the global coffee company Peet's public in Europe in 2020, and its Krispy Kreme Inc. brand made its debut in the U.S. public markets a year ago. Panera said last year that it would sell bakery brand Au Bon Pain to restaurant operator Ampex Brands. In August, JAB combined Panera Bread with Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. under one unit.</p><p>Last year saw a number of restaurant companies debut on the public markets. Coffee chain Dutch Bros Inc., breakfast and brunch spot First Watch Restaurant Group Inc., salad chain Sweetgreen Inc. and hot dog company Portillo's Inc. all went public last year through IPOs.</p><p>Panera Bread Scraps IPO Deal With Danny Meyer's SPAC</p>",
