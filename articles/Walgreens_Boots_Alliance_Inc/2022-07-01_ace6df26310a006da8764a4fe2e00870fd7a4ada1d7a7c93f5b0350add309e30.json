  "title": "Kohl's Ends Talks of Its Sale to Vitamin Shoppe Owner Franchise Group; Department-store chain says it will no longer pursue a sales process amid current retail environment",
  "text": "<p>Kohl's Chairman Peter Boneparth said that recent choppiness in the financing market and the retail industry had made a deal unattainable. \"Given the environment and market volatility, the board determined that it simply was not prudent to continue pursuing a deal,\" he said.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Boneparth said the board has confidence in the company's management to execute its strategic plan. \"While there was criticism from activists, the vast majority of shareholders are supportive of the direction management is taking the company,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Boneparth said the company is exploring other ways to unlock value for shareholders, including by selling some real estate and buying back stock.</p><p>Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass said the company is rolling out Sephora shops in more than 850 of its stores by the end of 2023 and opening 100 smaller format stores over the next four years. \"Sephora is a game changer,\" she said.</p><p>Shares in Kohl's, which also cut its sales forecast for the current quarter, fell more than 15% in premarket trading.</p><p>Kohl's board began to engage with advisers in late January after receiving informal inquiries about buying the department-store chain, the company said in a securities filing. The company said it attracted interest from more than 25 parties. Bidders included the private-equity firm Sycamore Partners and Canada's Hudson's Bay, owner of Saks, during a monthslong sales process, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>The retailer last month entered exclusive deal talks with Franchise Group, which owns retail brands like Vitamin Shoppe. Franchise Group initially offered to pay $60 a share for Kohl's—a deal valued at around $8 billion—but ultimately reduced the price to $53 a share, without definitive financing to close the deal, Kohl's said.</p><p>Kohl's said Friday that the two sides \"faced significant obstacles reaching a fully executable agreement.\"</p><p>Inflation is driving interest rates higher and raising the cost of capital, slowing deal making from its record-setting pace last year. Earlier this week, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said it would keep its Boots and No7 Beauty Co. businesses after failing to receive adequate bids.</p><p>Kohl's has also been facing a downturn in discretionary spending that has hit the retail industry particularly hard, with climbing inflation pushing consumers to prioritize their shopping needs.</p><p>On Friday, Kohl's said inflation is cutting further into consumer spending and that it expects sales to fall at a high-single-digit rate in its second quarter, worse than prior expectations of a low-single-digit drop. The company also reaffirmed plans to conduct a $500 million accelerated stock buyback after its second-quarter earnings report, which is slated for Aug. 18.</p><p>\"The consumer is facing a lot of pressure, and we'll navigate that effectively,\" Ms. Gass said. \"We stand for value and have a lot of agility with pricing and promotions.\"</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com and Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com</p><p>Kohl's Ends Talks of Its Sale to Vitamin Shoppe Owner Franchise Group</p>",
