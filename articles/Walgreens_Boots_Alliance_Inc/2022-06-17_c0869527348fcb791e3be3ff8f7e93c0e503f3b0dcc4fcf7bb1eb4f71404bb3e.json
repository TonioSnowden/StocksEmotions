  "text": "<p>P&amp;G said that broad supply-chain challenges coincided with an increase in demand. The company said availability has increased significantly in the past several months as it works with retailers to improve supply.</p><p>Rival Edgewell Personal Care Co., the company behind Playtex and o.b. tampons, also said it has run into production problems in the past year.</p><p>Kotex maker Kimberly-Clark Corp. said in a statement that it hasn't experienced a product or supply shortage. Kimberly-Clark is the industry's third-biggest player in tampons behind P&amp;G and Edgewell. Its sales and market share declined over the past year, according to firms that monitor such purchases.</p><p>Tampons and sanitary napkins are a $3 billion-a-year industry in the U.S. Overall, U.S. demand for tampons is about the same as it was a year ago, data tracking firm IRI said.</p><p>An average of 7% of tampons were out of stock in U.S. stores the week ended Sunday, IRI said. Out-of-stock rates for the product have been steadily improving over the past month. Rates below 10% are considered healthy.</p><p>A handful of states and about a dozen individual markets have out-of-stock rates above that 10% threshold, with Arkansas and West Virginia among the hardest hit. Elsewhere, several parts of Indiana, and the Jackson, Miss., and Wheeling, W.Va., regions are experiencing short supply, according to IRI.</p><p>\"It's very needle in a haystack right now,\" said Allison Corson, a 24-year-old woman in Philadelphia who has struggled to find her preferred Tampax Radiant super or super-plus tampons. She has resorted to buying tampons when she travels to New Jersey, more than an hour from where she lives.</p><p>Drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. said they are experiencing temporary shortages of specific tampon varieties. CVS said some manufacturers aren't able to fully fill the orders.</p><p>The companies declined to elaborate on the extent of shortages or disclose which brands were in shortest supply.</p><p>On Thursday, tampons from all major brands were available on websites for Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., both for in-store pickup and delivery, though some variants were sold out. Availability on Amazon.com was spottier.</p><p>A Walmart spokeswoman said the company isn't experiencing a tampon shortage. Target is working with manufacturers where product has been more limited to secure additional inventory.</p><p>P&amp;G said its tampon sales have increased 10% since late 2020. The company credits Tampax's increased popularity in part to a sweeping educational marketing campaign featuring comedian Amy Schumer with health professionals, launched in 2020.</p><p>Supply-chain disruptions in Edgewell's feminine-care business and a lack of raw materials hurt product availability and the company's ability to meet demand, executives said on Edgewell's second-quarter earnings call.</p><p>Edgewell's feminine products are solely manufactured at a 500,000-square-foot plant in Dover, Del., that runs around the clock. The facility was hard-hit by Covid-19 in December, leading to between around 10% and 15% of its workforce to be out sick.</p><p>By the end of January, the virus was spreading in Canada, impacting the company's suppliers, meaning Edgewell couldn't get its materials, according to the company.</p><p>Amanda Currie, a 38-year-old healthcare worker in the Detroit area, went to Target, CVS and Walgreens in May and wasn't able to find any of her preferred Tampax Ultras, a brand made by P&amp;G.</p><p>\"I can't buy light or regular and that's generally what I was seeing,\" said Ms. Currie. She found her brand on Amazon, but the price was outrageous, she said. Ultimately, she ended up paying a friend through Venmo for tampons.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
