  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Walgreens Boots Alliance is out of favor on Wall Street. But Thursday's strong fiscal third-quarter results suggest that attitude should soften in the months ahead. </p><p>\n  The pharmacy giant reported sales of just over $34 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.38 a share in the quarter that ended in May; both figures topped analyst estimates. Walgreens also raised its full-year earnings guidance to about 10% growth from a year earlier. That is the second straight quarter it has raised its outlook since new Chief Executive Rosalind Brewer took over the top job in March. </p><p>\n  Evidently, actual shareholders had expected more than did the analysts: The stock fell 6% in morning trading. But it has also rallied about 50% since last September, when shares reached a multiyear low. </p><p>\n  Stronger prescription growth was key to results: Comparable prescriptions grew nearly 10% from a year earlier in the U.S. That growth came primarily from Covid-19 vaccinations administered by the company. </p><p>\n  But the higher vaccination rate meant more patients returned to doctors' offices as well. During the pandemic, new prescription volumes were especially weak as patients deferred nonemergency medical care. Those deferrals hampered results for all sorts of healthcare businesses, and pharmacies were no exception. Over time, patients will likely catch up on most of that deferred care. </p><p>\n  Stronger prescription growth brings customers into the stores and boosts sales of other products. Retail sales grew by a modest 1.7% from a year earlier in the May quarter, but that growth came from beauty products and photo sales, which carry relatively high profit margins. </p><p>\n  Shareholders will have to grapple with significant uncertainty. Vaccination rates are falling in the U.S. at the moment, and it remains unclear whether or when patients will need booster shots. There are also fundamental business challenges that won't go away even once the pandemic is truly over. For example, traditional bricks-and-mortar pharmacies face the threat of competition from Amazon. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, there are also obvious sources of upside: Lockdowns in the U.K. have hammered sales at Boots locations, but that situation should improve in the months ahead. The company said Thursday that foot traffic at its U.K. stores has shown early signs of recovery, but locations in airports and train stations are still lagging. And the slew of worries mean the stock can be had for a reasonable price. Shares trade at less than 12 times its pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 results, a bargain in today's stock market. </p><p>\n  Walgreens' health is clearly improving. Despite Thursday's selloff, it is a good bet that investor attitudes will soon follow. </p><p></p>",
