  "text": "<p>The people should receive a booster at least six months after they had taken a second dose, the FDA said.</p><p>The authorization is a major step toward making the extra doses available after some people who had been vaccinated but were eager for added protection tried to get the extra shot but were turned away.</p><p>It caps weeks of public debate—over whether booster shots are necessary, when they should be given and who should receive them—that has split federal health officials and outside health experts.</p><p>Some federal health officials have said boosters shots are important for helping the vaccinated sustain protection against the Delta variant that has swept across the U.S.</p><p>Boosters will help the U.S. stay ahead of the pandemic, federal health officials have said.</p><p>Yet other health experts and researchers, including some within the federal government, have said there isn't conclusive data supporting wide use, pointing to research showing the vaccines continue to work at preventing severe disease and death.</p><p>In clearing boosters, the U.S. joins Israel, Germany, the U.K. and other wealthier countries administering additional doses.</p><p>However, the World Health Organization has urged the nations to forgo boosters for now and instead share the shots with low-income countries who haven't been able to access vaccines.</p><p>The additional doses should be available in the U.S. in the coming days, authorities said, but will also depend on a vote—by a panel of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meeting Wednesday and Thursday—on who should receive the shots.</p><p>The vaccines are expected to be available at some 80,000 locations around the U.S., including retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as mass vaccination sites and doctor's offices.</p><p>The Biden administration and Pfizer have said that there should be enough supply for the boosters, which will be available to no cost to people in the U.S.</p><p>(more to come)</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When do you expect to get your Covid-19 booster shot?
