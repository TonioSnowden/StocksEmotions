  "title": "Should I Get a Covid-19 Vaccine Booster Shot? What to Know; Questions and answers on issues such as how well boosters protect against the Delta variant and how effective they are",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration's plans to offer boosters of the Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have been delayed as regulators continue to analyze data about them. The FDA and CDC so far have only considered Pfizer's booster plan. Moderna has also submitted one, and J &amp; J is expected to do so.</p><p>Boosters, health authorities have said, might help extend the protection conferred by immunization, and help fight contagious variants such as Delta. Here is what we know about the need for boosters.</p><p>What is a booster shot?</p><p>It is an extra dose of the vaccine. In the case of the messenger RNA vaccines, it would be a third dose. For the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, the third dose will likely be the same. For the Moderna vaccine, the FDA is studying whether to give a lower dose than the first two. The extra dose mobilizes your body's immune system defenses further to protect against Covid-19, health authorities say. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said early testing indicates a booster shot given at least six months after the second vaccine dose produces antibody levels five to 10 times higher than after two doses. Johnson &amp; Johnson said Sept. 21 that a booster dose of its one-dose vaccine administered two months after the first shot increased protection against symptomatic illness in trial participants.</p><p>Should I get a booster shot?</p><p>The FDA recommended boosters for people who are 65 years and older or are at risk of severe disease and death, including because of their jobs or where they live. The CDC backed the shots for seniors, many adults with underlying health conditions and workers at high risk of Covid-19 exposure.</p><p>Many people will qualify for the booster because the CDC's list of underlying medical conditions is wide-ranging. They include cancer, chronic lung and kidney disease and heart disease, as well as diabetes, obesity, pregnancy and smoking. The eligible—people who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot—would get an extra dose at least six months after their second dose.</p><p>An extra Covid-19 vaccine dose could mobilize more antibodies against the coronavirus, though the evidence supporting an additional dose isn't definitive. The immune system is complicated, involving more than antibodies. Other studies are still under way evaluating any benefit from an extra dose.</p><p>Data published in the New England Journal of Medicine from Israel, which began offering boosters to people over 60 in July, found that rates of infection and severe illness were substantially lower among study participants age 60 and over who had been vaccinated at least five months earlier and then received a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The study analyzed the medical records of 1.1 million people.</p><p>People with weakened immune systems might stand to benefit most from the additional dose. Shots were already available for some of these people, who are known as being immunocompromised. Those eligible include people who have received an organ transplant or are taking a drug that weakens their immune responses.</p><p>Where can I get the booster shot?</p><p>Getting the booster will be similar to getting the initial course of vaccination, federal health officials said.</p><p>The vaccines are expected to be available at some 80,000 locations around the U.S., including retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as mass-vaccination sites and doctors' offices. The Biden administration and Pfizer have said that there should be enough supply for the boosters, which will be available to no cost to people in the U.S.</p><p>Will boosters better protect against Delta or other variants?</p><p>Researchers say the current vaccines appear to work well against variants of concern that have emerged so far. Yet they might not work as strongly against newer variants as they do against earlier ones. For that reason, people might want booster shots to ensure that they get the fullest level of protection possible against the variants. And they would want a third shot if any variants emerge that prove better able to evade current vaccines. Drugmakers are working on shots targeting variants.</p><p>Is it safe for me to get a booster shot from a different vaccine brand?</p><p>For immunocompromised people who already are authorized to get a third messenger RNA dose, the CDC says they should try to get the same type of vaccine as their first two shots but can mix and match if they have to. Mixing and matching is under study right now. The decision Sept. 22 only applies to people who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine already.</p><p>In June, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases started a study looking at whether mixing and matching vaccines and boosters could prolong immunity and better protect against variants. One thing the study will explore is the best combination of shots. It could be that getting a vaccine from one manufacturer and a booster from another might actually produce stronger protection, researchers say. The ability to mix and match might also simplify the logistics of giving people boosters.</p><p>I got Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. What does this mean for me?</p><p>The FDA has been weighing whether adults who received Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose shot will need another Covid-19 vaccine shot. It is likely this population will also need booster shots, according to U.S. health authorities.</p><p>The company said Sept. 21 that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine administered two months after the first shot increased protection against symptomatic illness in trial participants.</p><p>Data from a late-stage clinical trial showed that study participants in 10 countries including the U.S. who received a second dose of the company's vaccine two months after the first had 75% protection against symptomatic Covid-19. Participants in the U.S. had 94% protection against the illness. J &amp; J didn't explain the reason for the difference in efficacy rates. The company earlier this year said a single dose of its vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe Covid-19.</p><p>\"We now have generated evidence that a booster shot further increases protection against Covid-19 and is expected to extend the duration of protection significantly,\" said Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at J &amp; J.</p><p>Can I get the flu vaccine and a Covid-19 booster shot at the same time?</p><p>The CDC says that flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines can be given together. It also recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive a flu shot by the end of October because flu activity peaks December through February. Health experts have warned that the coming flu season is on track to be worse than the last cycle as Covid-19 restrictions that also helped prevent the spread of the flu virus are eased.</p><p>What about people with weakened immune systems?</p><p>The FDA had already authorized the additional dose for certain people with compromised immune systems. Research shows that immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19, are more likely to transmit it to household contacts and more likely to have breakthrough infections.</p><p>The immunocompromised include transplant recipients, some cancer survivors and people living with HIV; their weakened immune systems make them less responsive to vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to provide protection. The elderly also tend to have weaker immune systems, and they are also likely candidates for boosters.</p><p>Why wouldn't Covid-19 immunity last?</p><p>Studies suggest and many researchers say the immunity provided by Covid-19 vaccines will wane over time.</p><p>The vaccines work by generating neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating.</p><p>Pfizer has said that antibody levels start to decline from their earlier peaks about eight months after the second dose. After a third shot, antibody levels were up more than five times among people ages 18 to 55 and more than 11 times in people ages 65 to 85, compared with two doses, according to Pfizer's data.</p><p>Even with reduced antibodies, vaccines are protecting against severe disease, according to researchers and published research. That is because the vaccines help other immune-system weapons: the T-cells that hunt down infected cells and destroy them, and memory B-cells, which circulate in the blood and help churn out antibodies upon detecting a virus. Both are likely helping prevent severe disease, according to researchers.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com and Jared S.
