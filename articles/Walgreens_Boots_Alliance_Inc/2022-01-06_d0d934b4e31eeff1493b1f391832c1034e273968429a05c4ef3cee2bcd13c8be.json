  "text": "<p>* Bitcoin is extending its slump, but crypto stocks aren't being uniformly dragged down with it. Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital fell 0.7% premarket and Hut 8 Mining slid 4.7%, but bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase rose 1% and Bakkt Holdings added 1%. In a crypto rout, perhaps its better to make your money trading the stuff than spending money on digging it up.</p><p>* Walgreens Boots Alliance added 4.3% premarket. The pharmacy retailer reported results that beat forecasts and lifted its full-year guidance.</p><p>* Alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands slipped 0.5% after it posted lower sales and earnings in the latest quarter, though its adjusted profit beat analysts' expectations.</p><p>* Datadog shares added 2.2% ahead of the bell on an otherwise bad day for tech shares, albeit in low-volume trading. The cloud security company said it had entered a partnership with Amazon Web Services on product development.</p><p>* Akamai Technologies shares dropped 2.6% premarket after Piper Sandler cut its rating on the stock and lowered its price target.</p><p>* Flagship meme stocks AMC Entertainment and GameStop are finding their footing, with premarket rises of 1.2% and 2%, after suffering particularly badly during Wednesday's broad market drop.</p><p>* Crude prices are climbing, and energy companies are along for the ride. Chevron rose 1.3%, Exxon Mobil climbed 1.6%, Occidental Petroleum added 2.8% and Baker Hughes gained 2%.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Investors are betting that rising interest rates and a tech swoon could bring American stocks' winning streak to an end in 2022.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Bitcoin, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Walgreens, Exxon: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
