  "text": "<p>Third-quarter sales were $73.79 billion overall, a rise from $67.06 billion in 2020's third quarter. CVS posted an adjusted profit of $1.97 a share, up from $1.66 a share a year earlier.</p><p>The results exceeded the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted sales of $70.52 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.79 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>As the Delta variant of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. through the summer, Covid-19 concerns continued to bring customers to pharmacies. The company administered more than eight million tests in the quarter as CVS's testing program expanded.</p><p>CVS also administered 11 million Covid-19 vaccinations in the quarter. Its pharmacies, as well as those of competitors such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp., have been a key venue for distributing shots since the U.S.'s vaccination campaign ramped up around the start of this year. More recently, the companies have been preparing to offer larger volumes of booster shots and vaccinations for children and teens.</p><p>That effort—as with many companies large and small—has strained against hiring difficulties as the economy lurches back into gear. In September, CVS launched a one-day career event meant to draw 25,000 new workers, as the company anticipated staffing needs for Covid-19 shots and tests as well as flu shots.</p><p>For the latest quarter, CVS said it hired a record number of employees, including nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses. The company, with its Aetna insurance unit, also bulked up to prepare for open enrollment season and in anticipation of high demand for flu shots.</p><p>\"Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business,\" CVS Chief Executive Karen Lynch said in a call with analysts.</p><p>The company is also raising its minimum hourly wage to $15.</p><p>Meanwhile, income edged higher in CVS's health-insurance business, which includes Aetna. Its government-services arm improved in performance, CVS said, which offset higher costs related to Covid-19.</p><p>Looking ahead, CVS lifted its full-year outlook. It said it now expects to report a per-share adjusted profit of $7.90 to $8.00 in 2021, up from a previous forecast of $7.70 to $7.80.</p><p>Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Health Posts Higher Revenue as Customers Seek Covid-19 Tests, Vaccines</p>",
