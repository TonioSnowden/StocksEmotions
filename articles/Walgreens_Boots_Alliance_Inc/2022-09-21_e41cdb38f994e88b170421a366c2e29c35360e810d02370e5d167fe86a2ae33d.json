  "text": "<p>   Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has reached a $1.37 billion deal to take full ownership of Shields Health Solutions. </p><p>   The company said on Tuesday that it had signed an agreement to acquire an additional 30% stake in Shields, rounding out the roughly 70% stake it had built up since July 2019, as Walgreens moves toward providing more healthcare services. </p><p>   Shields partners with hospitals and health networks nationwide to provide specialty pharmacy services, which typically entail high-cost products for severe illnesses and complex diseases. </p><p>   Walgreens said on Tuesday that Shields has delivered 57% sales growth in the first nine months of 2022. </p><p>   The pharmacy-chain operator started making moves to take ownership of Shields three years ago when it and a private-equity firm made equity investments in the company on terms that weren't disclosed. </p><p>   Shields said at the time that the investments would bolster its national expansion. </p><p>   Last fall, Walgreens increased its stake to about 70% with a $970 million investment that included an option for the company to pick up any remaining equity interests in the future. </p><p>   The deal to take full ownership of Shields is expected to close by the end of the calendar year, after which the company will continue operating as a distinct business and brand within the Walgreens umbrella. </p><p>   Walgreens also said on Tuesday that John Standley is stepping down as president of the Walgreens Co. subsidiary in a management shakeup that will see the unit reorganized under two leaders. </p><p>   Under the restructuring, Shields chief Lee Cooper will take over pharmacy operations while Tracey Brown, president of retail products and chief customer officer, will head the retail side, Walgreens said. </p><p></p>",
