  "title": "Walgreens  Nears Deal  For Urgent  Care Firm  ----  By Laura Cooper",
  "text": "<p>   A unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is nearing a deal to combine with a big owner of medical practices and urgent-care centers in a transaction valued at roughly $9 billion including debt, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The potential deal is among a string of acquisitions by big consumer-focused companies aiming to delve deeper into medical care. </p><p>   The drugstore giant's primary-care-center subsidiary, Village Practice Management, would combine with Summit Health, the parent company of CityMD urgent-care centers, in an agreement that could be reached as early as Monday, the people said. </p><p>   Health insurer Cigna Corp. will invest in the combined company, the people said. </p><p>   There is no guarantee the parties will reach a deal, the people cautioned, noting that they are still hammering out details of an agreement. </p><p>   Summit Health, which is backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, has more than 370 locations in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and  Oregon, according to the company's website. Current and former physicians also own a large interest in the business. </p><p>   Village Practice Management, which does business as VillageMD, provides care for patients at free-standing practices and at Walgreens locations, virtually and in the home. </p><p>   Walgreens appears to have pre-empted a sale process for Summit Health that was set to kick off next year, according to the people, who said the company was about to interview banks before it received interest from VillageMD. </p><p>   Summit Health has been backed by Warburg Pincus since 2017, when it took a stake in CityMD, a large chain of New York City urgent-care centers. </p><p>   Since that time, Warburg has helped the company complete multiple transformative acquisitions, including the 2019 merger of CityMD and multispeciality medical-practice group, Summit Medical Group. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
