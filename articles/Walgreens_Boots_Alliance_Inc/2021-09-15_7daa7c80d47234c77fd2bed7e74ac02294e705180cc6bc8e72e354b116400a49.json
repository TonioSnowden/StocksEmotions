  "title": "Theranos Projections Called Rosy",
  "text": "<p>During continued questioning of Theranos's longtime corporate controller, Danise Yam, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Leach showed projections given to investors that Theranos would log $140 million in revenue in 2014 and $990 million in 2015.</p><p>\"Do you have any idea where that number came from?\" Mr. Leach asked Ms. Yam, who also goes by the name So Han Spivey. \"No,\" Ms. Yam replied, adding that she hadn't helped prepare it.</p><p>Ms. Yam said during questioning that she gave more modest revenue projections to a company hired to value Theranos stock, ranging from $50 million in 2013 to nearly $132 million in 2016.</p><p>The next witness Tuesday was Erika Cheung, a former Theranos lab worker who alerted federal regulators to problems at the company. A third witness expected this week, according to court filings, is Daniel Edlin, a onetime project manager who reported directly to Ms. Holmes and could testify about technology claims Theranos made to the Defense Department and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.</p><p>Collectively, statements made by the three in this case and other legal proceedings back up prosecutors' central arguments that Theranos's secretive culture fostered deception and coverups, that the company misled investors about its finances and that it skirted federal regulations.</p><p>Ms. Holmes faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a white-collar criminal case that has captivated Silicon Valley and been the fodder for a book, movies and podcasts. She has pleaded not guilty. Ms. Holmes's attorney has portrayed her as a dedicated entrepreneur who may have been a bit naive but whose only crime was that her startup failed, as many startups do. The trial is expected to last more than three months.</p><p>Ms. Cheung declined to comment. Mr. Edlin and Ms. Yam didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Journal's investigative reporting in 2015 and 2016 exposed how Theranos's technology didn't work, how the blood-testing company tried to cover up its failures and how patients' lives were affected and their health jeopardized.</p><p>Ms. Yam managed finances at Theranos for 11 years. During that time, the company suffered losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Ms. Yam said the blood-testing company reported accumulated losses on a tax return of $585 million from 2003 to 2015.</p>",
