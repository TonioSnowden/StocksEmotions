  "title": "Walmart Sales Rise as Retail Giant Gains More Shoppers; Nation's largest retailer by revenue raises sales outlook, though it says consumers reduced purchases of electronics and home goods",
  "text": "<p>There were also signs that the country's largest retailer by revenue continues to shrink a glut of goods that has weighed on its business and cast a shadow over the holiday selling season. Inventories were more than 12% higher than a year ago, compared with increases of 25% and 33% in the previous two quarters.</p><p>Large retailers have been canceling orders with suppliers, resisting price increases for products and, in some cases, asking suppliers to provide discounts to help remedy the situation.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. business has under $1 billion in excess inventory, down from about $1.5 billion last quarter, company executives said. Most of that is now in stores, not in the supply chain, which gives Walmart more control over how to offload it, said John David Rainey, Walmart's chief financial officer, in an interview.</p><p>The parent of Walmart and Sam's Club plans to continue to discount items that have been most challenging to sell, including home goods, electronics and apparel, he said.</p><p>\"As we've exited the pandemic, and [consumers'] dollars are being stretched further, those are items that are more discretionary,\" said Mr. Rainey. Shoppers are buying those items when they are on sale, he said.</p><p>Walmart's stock rose nearly 8% in Tuesday trading to $149, as the company raised its sales outlook and said earnings on an adjusted basis would decline by a smaller margin than it previously expected. Shares in the retail giant are up 3% this year, compared with a 7% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 16% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Walmart executives said Tuesday that they remain cautious on the health of the U.S. consumer over the next year in the face of high food and gas prices. The company's report comes amid news that rival Amazon.com Inc. is preparing to cut what could be about 10,000 corporate jobs. Walmart has had an \"extreme focus on the expense side of the business,\" which helped Walmart beat earnings expectations in the most recent quarter, said Mr. Rainey, on a conference call Tuesday.</p><p>Walmart kicks off a string of reports from retail chains ahead of the critical Black Friday shopping event next week. Target Corp. and Macy's Inc. are slated to release their quarterly reports later this week.</p><p>Home Depot Inc. also on Tuesday reported steady sales growth in its latest quarter, with comparable sales up 4.3% in the quarter ended Oct. 30, lifted by higher prices. Traffic fell 4.3% from the prior year, the company said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Walmart? Join the conversation below.</p><p>For lower-income Americans there are signs that savings are dwindling and spending on necessities is still elevated, said Walmart executives. \"They are not going to continue to dig into their piggy banks to spend as we get into next year,\" said Mr. Rainey. Inflation is cooling in some general-merchandise categories, he said, but is persistent in food.</p><p>Walmart, with its \"everyday low price\" marketing and significant grocery business, typically does well in times of weaker consumer spending. During the most recent quarter, households earning $100,000 or more helped push Walmart grocery sales higher, executives said. Ahead of Thanksgiving, Walmart has promoted a basket of typical meal purchases such as turkey and corn muffin mix sold at last year's prices.</p><p>Lower sales of generally higher-margin categories, such as electronics, home and apparel, ate into profits for Walmart. The retailer raised prices during the quarter to offset some higher costs, it said.</p><p>Inflation eased last month but remained high, offering a sign that the price increases of the last year may be cooling. The retailer raised prices during the quarter to offset some higher costs, it said. The average amount that Walmart U.S. shoppers spent per trip rose 6% from last year, while it increased 4.9% for Sam's Club shoppers.</p><p>Walmart recorded a more than $3 billion charge in the latest quarter in connection with a settlement of opioid-related lawsuits brought by several U.S. states and municipalities, a move that comes weeks after pharmacy chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. reached similar settlements.</p><p>The settlement helped push Walmart to a quarterly loss of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.11 billion a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as the opioid settlement, the company's earnings per share were $1.50, which was ahead of analysts' expectations.</p><p>The company also unveiled a new $20 billion share buyback authorization, after ending the third quarter with about $1.9 billion left under its previous program.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Sales Rise as Retail Giant Gains More Shoppers</p>",
