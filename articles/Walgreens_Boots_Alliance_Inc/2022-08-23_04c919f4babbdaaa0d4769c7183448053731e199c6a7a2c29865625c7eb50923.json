  "title": "Should You Get a Covid-19 Vaccine Booster Shot? What to Know; Questions and answers on issues such as how well boosters protect against the Omicron variant and who is eligible",
  "text": "<p>An extra dose of the vaccine from Moderna is cleared for people at least 18 years old. Doses from Johnson &amp; Johnson are authorized only for adults for whom other shots aren't available or medically appropriate, or who won't take another vaccine.</p><p>Here is what we know about the need for boosters.</p><p>What is a booster shot?</p><p>It is an extra dose of the vaccine. In the case of the messenger RNA vaccines, it is a third dose, as well as a fourth dose for some people. The extra dose mobilizes your body's immune-system defenses further to protect against Covid-19, health authorities say. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said early testing indicates a booster shot given at least six months after the second vaccine dose produces antibody levels five to 10 times higher than after two doses. Johnson &amp; Johnson said, in announcing it had asked the FDA to authorize a booster, that the shot increased the protection of the company's one-dose vaccine to 94% in the U.S.</p><p>Should I get a booster shot?</p><p>The CDC recommends that anyone 12 years old or older get an additional shot after completing a first series of Covid-19 vaccination, especially given the threat of the Omicron variant.</p><p>The agency also recommends that children 5- to 11-years-old get the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. The CDC had already recommended that children in this age group with weakened immune systems get a booster as well. Research suggests that people with weakened immune systems may not get enough protection without an extra dose.</p><p>Anyone who initially received a shot of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna and is eligible for a booster shot may now have it administered at least five months after they received their second dose.</p><p>Adults who got the J&amp;J single-dose vaccine had already been authorized to get a booster at least two months after their shot, and the CDC recommends they get either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster.</p><p>The FDA has cleared a second booster shot from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna for adults 50 years and older. These adults can get an additional dose at least four months after receiving their first booster shot, and can choose from Pfizer or Moderna regardless of which booster they initially received.</p><p>What about people with weakened immune systems?</p><p>The FDA has authorized boosters for certain adults with compromised immune systems. The CDC recommends a three-shot primary series for certain people with compromised immune systems, with the fourth dose serving as a booster.</p><p>In March, the FDA authorized second booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years old and up with weakened immune systems and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized Covid-19 vaccine. The agency also authorized a second Moderna booster for immunocompromised people 18 years old and above.</p><p>Research shows that immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19, are more likely to transmit it to household contacts and more likely to have breakthrough infections.</p><p>The immunocompromised include transplant recipients, some cancer survivors and people living with HIV; their weakened immune systems make them less responsive to vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to provide protection. The elderly also tend to have weaker immune systems, and they are also likely candidates for boosters.</p><p>A mobile health clinic offering Covid-19 vaccines in Salinas, Calif., in March.

The vaccines are available at retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as doctors' offices. The Biden administration has said there is enough supply for boosters.</p><p>The federal government has been providing vaccines free of charge in the U.S. under a program through which Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurers pay doctors, pharmacies and other vaccination sites for administering the shots. The uninsured could face fees for getting a shot, however, because a separate program covering the cost has stopped accepting claims because of a lack of funding.</p><p>Should I get a booster now, or wait until there is a new vaccine targeting Omicron?</p><p>Doctors recommend getting a booster now rather than waiting. Even if the booster is less effective at preventing severe disease or hospitalization against Omicron than against earlier variants, doctors expect boosters to provide at least some protection against Omicron.</p><p>An analysis released by the CDC shows boosters are important in maximizing protection against the Omicron and Delta variants. The data back up earlier findings supporting booster shots.</p><p>Researchers have found that while the vaccines provide strong protection, such protection wanes over time. During the Omicron-predominance, a third dose reduced the risk of hospitalization by 91% during the two months after a booster shot, and after four months fell to 78%, according to a CDC study published in February.</p><p>As Omicron became the dominant strain, three doses of a mRNA vaccine were 94% effective in preventing mechanical ventilation or death, while people who received two doses were 79% less likely, according to a study published by the CDC.</p><p>Moderna has said that preliminary results from initial lab tests found that a third dose of their vaccine increased immune responses against the Omicron variant compared with two doses, suggesting that a booster could help protect against the new strain.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech have similarly reported early findings that indicate that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests, but the two-dose regimen was significantly less effective at blocking the virus. Still, the two-dose regimen may prove effective in preventing severe illness from Covid-19, the companies said.</p><p>The FDA has already directed vaccine manufacturers to modify their Covid-19 booster shots to better target the subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 of the Omicron variant, as well as the ancestral coronavirus strain. The agency indicated it may authorize the shots before results of human testing of such shots are known, and that the modified vaccines could potentially be used starting in early to mid-fall.</p><p>Pfizer and its partner BioNTech asked the FDA to clear use of a Covid-19 shot modified to target the original coronavirus plus the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron, which have become predominant in the U.S.</p><p>The companies said they have begun producing doses of the vaccines, and could begin supplying them to the U.S. government upon FDA clearance.</p><p>Moderna has also requested that the agency clear its booster shot targeting Omicron variants. The company said it is ready to ship doses of the new shot in September if it is cleared by the FDA.</p><p>Is it safe for me to get a booster shot from a different vaccine brand?</p><p>The CDC has backed booster mixing and matching, saying people can get a shot that is different from what they had received previously.</p><p>For immunocompromised people who already are authorized to get a third messenger RNA dose, the CDC says they should try to get the same type of vaccine as their first two shots but can mix and match if they have to.</p><p>The permission to mix and match vaccines and boosters would help ensure doses are available to anyone who wants one, while also increasing options for fully vaccinated people, according to health authorities.</p><p>The FDA's mixing-and-matching decision was informed by a National Institutes of Health study that showed that receiving a different vaccine than the original one received boosted antibody levels across all three vaccine types, particularly among Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients.</p><p>The NIH study showed that J&amp;J vaccine recipients boosted with a Moderna dose saw a 76-fold increase in antibody levels, while a Pfizer booster increased antibody levels 35-fold and a J&amp;J dose increased antibody levels fourfold.</p><p>The CDC has backed mixing and matching vaccines and boosters for Covid-19. PHOTO: Nic Coury for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>I got Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. What does this mean for me?</p><p>Any adult who got a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer and BioNTech or Moderna at least two months after the single-dose shot, according to the FDA.</p><p>If someone received the J&amp;J vaccine for both their primary shot and a first booster, they may get a second booster of either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, at least four months after the first booster.</p><p>In May, the FDA limited the use of J&amp;J's vaccine after reviewing the risk of life-threatening blood clots.</p><p>The shot's authorization is now only for adults for whom other shots aren't available or medically appropriate, or who have concerns with the mRNA vaccines.</p><p>The agency made its decision after it confirmed a total of 60 cases, including nine deaths, of the clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and because scientists don't currently know what risk factors lead to vaccinated patients developing the syndrome.</p><p>Still, J&amp;J has said that data continues to support a favorable benefit-risk profile of its vaccine, including extra doses in adults, when compared with no vaccine.</p><p>J&amp;J said studies have found a booster increased protection. An international study, in which subjects received two doses of its vaccine, 56 days apart, found the two-dose series was 75% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 disease overall, and 94% effective in the U.S. portion of the study. And the two-dose series was 100% effective against severe to critical cases, J&amp;J said.</p><p>J&amp;J also said studies found that the second dose boosted levels of immune-system agents known as antibodies significantly in the weeks following the booster.</p><p>I've been vaccinated and had Covid-19. Does a booster shot make sense for me? If so, when should I get one?</p><p>Doctors and vaccine experts say there isn't enough evidence to know yet when exactly a booster dose should be given to a vaccinated person fully recovered from Covid-19, and timing depends on the individual's own risk. For example, people who are at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19, such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions, should look to receive a booster relatively soon once they clear the virus.</p><p>Yet some physicians suggest that many recovered vaccinated people wait at least one month, possibly up to three, before getting a booster, depending on their individual risk. They say these individuals likely have strong protection against the virus, possibly up to three months, thanks to the infection, and can avoid what may be strong, uncomfortable side effects after getting the booster dose like chills, headache and fevers.</p><p>The CDC says fully vaccinated people who have been infected with Covid-19 can get a booster shot 90 days from symptom onset. Research shows long periods between infection and vaccination may prompt a better immune response to vaccination, according to the CDC. Patient risk such s immunosuppression and exposure to the virus should be taken into account when assessing the right time for vaccination, health experts said.</p><p>For recovered vaccinated people who had received monoclonal antibody treatments, the agency's guidelines for physicians say these people don't need to wait before receiving any Covid-19 vaccines. The guidelines, however, don't distinguish whether they apply to a primary vaccination series or boosters.</p><p>The CDC says that flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines can be given together. PHOTO: Nic Coury for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Can I get the flu vaccine and a Covid-19 booster shot at the same time?</p><p>The CDC says that flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines can be given together. It also recommends that everyone age 6 months and older receive a flu shot by the end of October because flu activity peaks December through February. Health experts have warned that the flu season is on track to be worse than the last cycle as Covid-19 restrictions that also helped prevent the spread of the flu virus are eased.</p><p>Why wouldn't Covid-19 immunity last?</p><p>Studies suggest and many researchers say the immunity provided by Covid-19 vaccines will wane over time.</p><p>The vaccines work by generating neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating.</p><p>Pfizer has said that antibody levels start to decline from their earlier peaks about eight months after the second dose. After a third shot, antibody levels were up more than five times among people ages 18 to 55 and more than 11 times in people ages 65 to 85, compared with two doses, according to Pfizer's data.</p><p>Even with reduced antibodies, vaccines are protecting against severe disease, according to researchers and published research. That is because the vaccines help other immune-system weapons: the T-cells that hunt down infected cells and destroy them, and memory B-cells, which circulate in the blood and help churn out antibodies upon detecting a virus. Both are likely helping prevent severe disease, according to researchers.</p><p>Peter Loftus and Sumathi Reddy contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
