  "title": "Walmart Revenue  Rises as Shoppers  Boost Store Visits  ----  By Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   Walmart Inc. reported stronger-than-expected sales during the fall quarter, an indication that shoppers were looking for deals but still spending ahead of the holiday shopping season. </p><p>   Walmart's comparable U.S. sales -- those from stores and digital channels operating over the past 12 months -- through Oct. 28 rose 8.2% from a year earlier. That is above the roughly 3% increase the company predicted in August. Sales of groceries, store brands and seasonal items were strong, the company said, helped by higher prices. Shopper visits to stores increased 2.1% in the third quarter. </p><p>   The company's total revenue rose 8.7% to $152.8 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31 compared with the same period last year. </p><p>   Walmart, the country's largest retailer by revenue, said Tuesday that households continue to face pressure from rising food prices, and lower-income shoppers are dipping into savings. Executives said shoppers are spending in some categories as they hunt for deals, which has lifted sales at the discount retailer, but it remains cautious on the health of the U.S. consumer over the next year and is working to lower prices. </p><p>   Walmart kicks off a string of reports from large retail chains ahead of the critical Black Friday shopping event -- typically among the year's largest single shopping days -- next week. Target Corp. and Macy's Inc. are slated to release their quarterly reports later this week. Home Depot Inc. also on Tuesday reported steady sales growth in its latest quarter, with comparable sales up 4.3% in the quarter ended Oct. 30, lifted by higher prices. </p><p>   Holiday retail sales are slated to grow, but at a slower pace than last year, according to retail industry groups and industry consultants, citing consumer strain from higher prices. </p><p>   The National Retail Federation predicted sales will rise between 6% and 8% to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion year over year between November and December, a slower pace of growth than last year. </p><p>   Some consulting firms such as Deloitte predicted shoppers will spend about the same amount over the holidays as last year, but on fewer gifts in response to rising prices. </p><p>   U.S. retail spending stalled in September from the previous month, according to government data, as shoppers faced high inflation and rising interest rates. The retail sales report for October is due out Wednesday. </p><p>   On Tuesday, Walmart showed signs it continues to shrink a glut of goods that has weighed on its business and cast a shadow over the holiday selling season. U.S. inventories were more than 12% higher than a year ago, compared with increases of 25% and 33% in the previous two quarters. </p><p>   Large retailers have been canceling orders with suppliers, resisting price increases for products and, in some cases, asking suppliers to provide discounts to help remedy the situation. </p><p>   Walmart's U.S. business has under $1 billion in excess inventory, down from about $1.5 billion last quarter, company executives said. Most of that is now in stores, not in the supply chain, which gives Walmart more control over how to unload it, said John David Rainey, Walmart's chief financial officer, in an interview. </p><p>   The retailer plans to continue to discount items that have been most challenging to sell, such as home goods, electronics and apparel, he said. </p><p>   \"As we've exited the pandemic, and [consumers'] dollars are being stretched further, those are items that are more discretionary,\" Mr. Rainey said. Shoppers are buying those items when they are on sale, he said. </p><p>   Walmart's stock rose nearly 7% Tuesday, as the company raised its sales outlook and said earnings on an adjusted basis would decline by a smaller margin than it previously expected. The share-price gain also came as the company reported that it swung to a quarterly loss after settling a series of lawsuits related to dispensing opioid medication. Shares of the retail giant are up about 2% this year, compared with a roughly 8% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 16% decline in the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   Walmart executives said Tuesday that they remain cautious on the health of the U.S. consumer over the next year in the face of high food and gas prices. The company's report comes amid news that rival Amazon.com Inc. is preparing to cut what could be about 10,000 corporate jobs. Walmart has had an \"extreme focus on the expense side of the business,\" which helped Walmart beat earnings expectations in the most recent quarter, Mr. Rainey said on a conference call Tuesday. </p><p>   For lower-income people, there are signs that savings are dwindling and spending on necessities is still elevated, Walmart executives said. \"They are not going to continue to dig into their piggy banks to spend as we get into next year,\" said Mr. Rainey. Inflation is cooling in some general-merchandise categories, he said, but is persistent in food. </p><p>   Walmart, with its \"everyday low price\" marketing and significant grocery business, typically does well when consumer spending is weak. During the most recent quarter, households earning $100,000 or more helped push Walmart grocery sales higher, executives said. </p><p>   Lower sales of generally higher-margin categories, such as electronics, home and apparel, ate into Walmart's profit. The retailer raised prices during the quarter to offset some higher costs, it said. </p><p>   Inflation eased last month but remained high, offering a sign that the price increases of the past year might be cooling. The average amount that Walmart U.S. shoppers spent per trip rose 6% from last year, while it increased 4.9% for Sam's Club shoppers. </p><p>   Walmart recorded a charge of more than $3 billion in the latest quarter in connection with a settlement of opioid-related lawsuits brought by several U.S. states and municipalities, a move that comes weeks after pharmacy chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. reached similar settlements. </p><p>   The settlement helped push Walmart to a third-quarter loss of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.11 billion a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as the opioid settlement, the company's earnings per share were $1.50, topping analysts' expectations. </p><p></p>",
