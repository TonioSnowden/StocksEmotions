  "title": "FDA Clears Covid-19 Booster Shots From Pfizer for High-Risk People; Third dose of the vaccine was authorized for people who are 65 or older or at high risk of severe Covid-19, including from their jobs",
  "text": "<p>The people should receive a booster at least six months after they had taken a second dose, the FDA said.</p><p>The authorization is a major step toward making the extra doses available after some people who had been vaccinated but were eager for added protection tried to get the extra shot but were turned away. Among those eligible: healthcare workers, teachers and grocery-store employees as well as prison inmates and those in homeless shelters.</p><p>Yet the authorization doesn't go as far as the Biden administration initially envisioned. The administration initially planned to make boosters available beginning this week to all adults, but the FDA dialed back its go-ahead after agency staff and advisers said that evidence so far didn't support broad use.</p><p>The development caps weeks of public debate—over whether booster shots are necessary, when they should be given and who should receive them—that has split federal health officials and outside health experts.</p><p>Some federal health officials have said boosters shots are important for helping the vaccinated sustain protection against the Delta variant that has swept across the U.S.</p><p>Boosters will help the U.S. stay ahead of the pandemic, federal health officials have said.</p><p>Yet other health experts and researchers, including some within the federal government, have said there isn't conclusive data supporting wide use, pointing to research showing the vaccines continue to work at preventing severe disease and death.</p><p>FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock indicated that the agency was interested in expanding access to booster doses, if more data emerged supporting broader use.</p><p>\"This pandemic is dynamic and evolving, with new data about vaccine safety and effectiveness becoming available every day. As we learn more about the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed,\" Dr. Woodcock said.</p><p>In clearing boosters, the U.S. joins Israel, Germany, the U.K. and other wealthier countries administering additional doses.</p><p>However, the World Health Organization has urged the nations to forgo boosters for now and instead share the shots with low-income countries who haven't been able to access vaccines.</p><p>The additional doses should be available in the U.S. in the coming days, authorities said, but will also depend on a vote—by a panel of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meeting Wednesday and Thursday—on who should receive the shots.</p><p>The CDC usually follows the recommendation of the panel. Vaccination sites don't have to follow the agency's guidance, but many pharmacies and doctors do in practice.</p><p>Covid-19 Vaccines</p><p>More WSJ coverage, selected by the editors</p><p>* Pfizer Covid-19 Booster Shouldn't Be for Moderna, J&amp;J Vaccine Recipients, Health Official Says</p><p>* Biden Pledges 500 Million More Pfizer Vaccine Donations for Poor Nations</p><p>* Pfizer Study of Covid-19 Vaccine in Pregnant Women Delayed by Slow Enrollment</p><p>* Europe's Covid-19 Vaccination Success Faces Winter Test</p><p>\"We have been preparing for weeks to administer booster shots to eligible Americans and are ready to do so following CDC's final recommendation later this week,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.</p><p>There are nearly 100 million people 65 and over who have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>The vaccines are expected to be available at some 80,000 locations around the U.S., including retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as mass vaccination sites and doctor's offices.</p><p>The Biden administration and Pfizer have said that there should be enough supply for the boosters, which will be available to no cost to people in the U.S.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 shot was the first to be authorized by regulators and the only one so far to be fully approved. Moderna Inc. has filed with regulators for full approval of its shot, and J&amp;J has said it plans to file this year.</p><p>Research has shown that Covid-19 vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech's remain highly protective against severe disease and death even without boosters.</p><p>Citing the vaccines' effectiveness, federal health officials in July dismissed talk of boosters, saying they weren't needed.</p><p>The spread of Delta and infections in a small number of people who were fully vaccinated prompted some people with weak immune systems and others to seek extra doses.</p><p>The shifting pandemic also prompted federal health officials to reassess the need for boosters.</p><p>Studies from Pfizer and elsewhere showed diminishing levels of antibody protection against infections.</p><p>\"We believe boosters have an important role to play in addressing the continued threat of this disease, alongside efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated. Today's FDA action is an important step in helping the most vulnerable among us remain protected from Covid-19,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When do you expect to get your Covid-19 booster shot? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Federal health officials have also cited data out of Israel that found that rates of infection and severe illness were substantially lower among study subjects aged 60 years and older who had been vaccinated at least five months earlier and then received a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine.</p><p>In August, the FDA authorized a third dose of Covid-19 shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna for certain people who are immunocompromised 12 years and older.</p><p>The latest green light came after FDA's own staff concluded recently that the vaccines cleared for use in the U.S., including Pfizer's, continue to afford protection against severe Covid-19 and death without additional doses.</p><p>The FDA authorization was in line with a recommendation last week by an outside advisory panel that recommended boosters be for only 65 and older and adults at high risk for severe disease.</p><p>The panel had also indicated it would support boosters for people at high risk of exposure at work, such as healthcare workers or teachers, but didn't formally vote on it.</p><p>The panel, however, rejected a request by Pfizer to clear the doses for people over 16 years old after a daylong meeting that included dueling presentations about booster doses.</p><p>The authorization applies to boosters of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech only.</p><p>Plans to offer extra doses of vaccines by Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are delayed because the FDA needs more time to collect and analyze data about them.</p><p>Moderna has asked the FDA to greenlight a smaller dose of its vaccine for administration as a booster, while J&amp;J has shared data with regulators but hasn't yet filed for authorization of its own shot.</p><p>Stephanie Armour contributed to the article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
