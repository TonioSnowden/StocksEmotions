  "text": "<p>Boots has benefited from shoppers returning to high streets and travelling more, boosting sales shortly after its US owner abandoned plans to sell the UK health and beauty retailer.</p> <p>The chain reported an increase in like-for-like sales of 15.2 per cent in the three months to August 31, compared with a year earlier. That was despite pharmacy sales falling almost 7 per cent as demand slipped for Covid-19 services such as vaccines.</p> <p>“We've seen people going on holiday again and a little bit of business travel as people go back to work, up from really a very low base. What's more encouraging is to see people coming back into town centres,” said Boots managing director Sebastian James.</p> <p>He said inflationary pressure in the health and beauty market was not as severe as in other sectors, running at about 3.5 per cent. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e5210578-da7c-4654-a1ec-57f7c8082697\">Boots</a> locked the price of about 1,500 of its most popular items and launched a “Boots Everyday” range with some items starting at 50p.</p> <p>“We get a little bit of the lipstick effect where the products we sell are an indulgence but they're relatively inexpensive. People might not get a new outfit but they may get a new lipstick and that's a benefit to us,” said James.</p> <p>Boots UK was thrown into uncertainty in June after its owner, the US pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef04cc7c-0b51-404e-9e40-58e10e9b8f75\">abandoned plans to sell the UK retailer</a>, citing a downturn in financial markets.</p> <p>The group did not provide an update on WBA's plan for the future of Boots.</p> <p>“We embarked on a process before the Ukrainian war, before the real bite of the cost of living crisis. Not surprisingly, it's not the right thing to do to push through a process when market conditions are so manifestly not right,” said James.</p> <p>“One day. the time will be right. There's no rush; we're very happy to be owned by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7218e1af-0f76-4512-ba5c-7945a1aab57c\">WBA</a>,” he added.</p> <p>Walgreens on Thursday posted a quarterly loss despite topping earnings expectations, as the pharmacy chain warned the strong dollar and slowing demand for Covid tests could weigh on future earnings growth.</p> <p>The Illinois-based retailer reported a loss of 48 cents per share for the fourth quarter, missing analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings of 47 cents. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $5.01, missing forecasts of $5.99 per share.</p> <p>Walgreens is moving to become a “consumer-centric healthcare company”, with the recent acquisitions of home care company CareCentrix and speciality pharmacy company Shields.</p> <p>It is also expanding its primary healthcare group VillageMD and opening more health corners in Walgreens stores, which offer patient screening services.</p> <p>Walgreens posted fourth-quarter sales down 5.3 per cent year on year to $32.4bn, surpassing analysts' expectations of $32.1bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sales in the company's US retail pharmacy segment decreased 7.2 per cent year on year to $26.7bn, while sales at its international unit fell 6.6 per cent, partly because of the strong dollar.</p> <p>It took a $783mn impairment charge on Boots, reflecting “uncertainty in the global markets and wider macroeconomic environment”.</p><p>Source: Abby Wallace in London and Alexandra White in New York 2022 'Boots sales recover as customers return to shops and travel resumes' FT.com 13 October.
