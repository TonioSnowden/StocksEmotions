  "title": "Business News:  Trial for Theranos  Ex-President Starts  ----  By Heather Somerville",
  "text": "<p>   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani wasn't in charge at Theranos Inc., and the blood-testing company was neither his idea nor his creation, his attorney told a jury Tuesday as the second criminal-fraud trial involving the defunct Silicon Valley startup got under way. </p><p>   The responsibility for the rise and fall of Theranos rests on founder and Chief Executive Elizabeth Holmes, attorney Stephen Cazares said in opening statements as he outlined the main points of Mr. Balwani's defense. </p><p>   \"Sunny Balwani did not start Theranos, he did not control Theranos,\" said Mr. Cazares. \"Elizabeth Holmes, not Sunny, founded Theranos and built Theranos.\" </p><p>   By the time Mr. Balwani joined Theranos in 2009 as president and chief operating officer, Ms. Holmes had spent six years building \"a small but sophisticated company,\" said Mr. Cazares. His knowledge of the company was largely based on what Ms. Holmes, who was also his girlfriend, and Theranos scientists told him, Mr. Cazares said. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani, 56 years old, the former president and chief operating officer at Theranos, faces a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly lying to investors and patients about the blood-testing startup's technology. Mr. Balwani helped run the company from 2009 to 2016 alongside Ms. Holmes, and helped finance it by underwriting a $13 million loan and buying $5 million in stock. The two had a romantic relationship that spanned more than a decade and was intertwined with their co-leadership of the company, according to evidence in the case. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes was found guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy in January in a separate criminal trial. </p><p>   The government has accused Mr. Balwani, like Ms. Holmes, of misleading investors, business partners and patients about the capabilities of Theranos's technology and its finances. Theranos claimed it could test for more than 200 health conditions using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. Prosecutors have alleged and witnesses in Ms. Holmes's trial testified that the company used its proprietary device for just 12 types of patient tests, and those tests could be inaccurate. Theranos relied on commercial blood analyzers for the majority of its tests, lawyers for both sides have said. </p><p>   The government's indictment against Mr. Balwani alleges fraud spanning from 2010 to 2016, during which Mr. Balwani was at the company. In Ms. Holmes's trial, she described Mr. Balwani as her closest business mentor who had influence over how she ran the business, although he wasn't the ultimate decision maker. </p><p>   \"This is a case about fraud. About lying and cheating to obtain money and property,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Leach. Mr. Balwani \"did this to get money from investors and he did this to get money and business from paying patients who were counting on Theranos to deliver accurate and reliable blood tests so that they could make important medical decisions.\" </p><p>   Mr. Leach said Mr. Balwani was responsible for what he described as false financial projections that were given to investors. Mr. Leach said Mr. Balwani told investors to expect Theranos would have $990 million in revenue in 2015, when in fact the company had less than $2 million in sales, among other projections Mr. Leach said were misleading. </p><p>   Mr. Cazares countered that allegation, saying Mr. Balwani accurately portrayed the company's expected revenue growth based on an agreement from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to put Theranos blood-testing devices in thousands of retail pharmacies. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani is an entrepreneur and immigrant from a family of farmers, who became wealthy from his own success in tech startups before going to work at Theranos, Mr Cazares said. Mr. Balwani had worked as a software engineer and had a business degree when he went to the blood-testing company, where he was put in charge of the lab despite having no medical or lab experience. </p><p>   Before Mr. Balwani's lawyers outlined the broad strokes of his defense, prosecutors Tuesday described Mr. Balwani as one-half of a business duo that lied to cheat investors and patients out of money. \"They were partners in everything, including their crimes,\" said Mr. Leach. </p><p></p>",
