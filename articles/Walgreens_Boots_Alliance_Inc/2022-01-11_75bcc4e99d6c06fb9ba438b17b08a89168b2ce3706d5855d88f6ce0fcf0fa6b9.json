  "title": "Covid-19 Vaccines and Tests Boost Albertsons and CVS Sales; Supply chain under stress from staffing shortages, Albertsons executives say; more consumers eating at home as Omicron spreads",
  "text": "<p>The roughly 11 million Covid-19 vaccinations that Albertsons said it has administered have helped create repeat customers, increasing pharmacy and grocery sales and lifting gross profits, executives said Tuesday.</p><p>\"This has been a major initiative for us, not only from a business perspective, but also from a social perspective,\" Sharon McCollam, Albertsons' chief financial officer, said on a conference call.</p><p>CVS separately projected its 2021 profitability would be stronger than previously expected, as executives said surprisingly high demand for Covid-19 vaccines in November and December boosted the largest U.S. pharmacy chain. CVS finance chief Shawn Guertin said Tuesday at an investor conference that more people sought on-location tests, and sales of over-the-counter Covid tests \"really took off.\"</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. last week said that demand for vaccines and at-home tests helped increase sales and profits in the drugstore giant's latest quarter, and led the company to boost its full-year profit forecast.</p><p>The Omicron variant's spread across the U.S. is also prompting consumers to eat more at home again, Albertsons executives said. The chain's identical sales—a metric that strips out the effects of store openings and closures—grew 5.2%, excluding fuel, for the quarter ended Dec. 4. Albertsons is passing through some increase in prices from food manufacturers, benefiting as people paid more for products.</p><p>Escalating Covid-19 infections are stressing Albertsons' supply chain, however, as executives said more workers are calling out sick. They said the chain expects to see more supply challenges in the next four to six weeks.</p><p>\"As we get past Omicron, we expect to see more of that capacity,\" said Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran on a call with analysts.</p><p>Supermarket companies such as Albertsons benefited from surging sales early in the pandemic as restaurants closed dining rooms and consumers cooked more meals at home. Sales growth for Albertsons has leveled off compared with the frenzied early months of the crisis, but identical sales in the latest quarter remained about 18% higher than in the same stretch of 2019, the company said.</p><p>Albertsons gained market share in the latest quarter, Mr. Sankaran said, and sales of fresh food are growing faster than in the rest of the store. The company has been automating production and simplifying tasks across stores so employees can spend more time on the floor, he added.</p><p>Like other grocers, Albertsons is spending more on overtime and raising wages to combat worker shortages, executives said. Albertsons' costs continue to rise in other areas like packaging, ingredients and transportation, executives said.</p><p>Mr. Sankaran said the company has been judicious about how it passes down such increases to consumers.</p><p>\"We have a strong consumer. We haven't seen a dramatic change in their behavior,\" he said, adding that he doesn't yet know whether shoppers' behavior will change if inflation continues to take hold.</p><p>Albertsons' digital sales for the quarter grew 9% from a year earlier and more than tripled from two years ago. The company said it would continue to invest in e-commerce, including pickup and warehouses for online orders.</p><p>Albertsons lifted its outlook for the fiscal year that runs through February, projecting that identical sales will decline by less than the company's previous forecast. The company said it is now expecting adjusted earnings of $2.90 a share to $2.95 a share in the February-ending year, up from previous guidance of $2.50 to $2.60.</p><p>At Monday's closing price of $31.90, Albertsons shares have more than doubled since the first trading day following the company's June 2020 initial public offering, when shares closed at $15.45. The stock fell 6% Tuesday morning.</p><p>Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Vaccines and Tests Boost Albertsons and CVS Sales</p>",
