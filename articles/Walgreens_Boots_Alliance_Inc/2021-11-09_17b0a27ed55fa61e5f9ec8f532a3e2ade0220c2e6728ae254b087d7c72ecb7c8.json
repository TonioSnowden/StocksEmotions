  "title": "Should You Get a Covid-19 Vaccine Booster Shot? What to Know; Questions and answers on issues such as how well boosters protect against the Delta variant and who is eligible",
  "text": "<p>Boosters, health authorities have said, might help extend the protection conferred by immunization, and help fight contagious variants such as Delta. Here is what we know about the need for boosters.</p><p>What is a booster shot?</p><p>It is an extra dose of the vaccine. In the case of the messenger RNA vaccines, it would be a third dose. For the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, the third dose will likely be the same. For the Moderna vaccine, the FDA is studying whether to give a lower dose than the first two. The extra dose mobilizes your body's immune system defenses further to protect against Covid-19, health authorities say. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said early testing indicates a booster shot given at least six months after the second vaccine dose produces antibody levels five to 10 times higher than after two doses. Johnson &amp; Johnson said, in announcing it had asked the FDA to authorize a booster, that the shot increased the protection of the company's one-dose vaccine to 94% in the U.S.</p><p>Should I get a booster shot?</p><p>The CDC's recommendation of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson boosters has made extra doses available to many adults who have been fully vaccinated and have passed the recommended waiting period. But who can get a booster—and when—depends on the original vaccine the person took.</p><p>Any adult who got a J&amp;J vaccine may get a booster at least two months after the single-dose shot.</p><p>People who were initially vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine can get any booster at least six months after their second dose so long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace.</p><p>Many people will qualify for the booster because the CDC's list of underlying medical conditions is wide-ranging. They include cancer, chronic lung and kidney disease and heart disease, as well as diabetes, obesity, pregnancy and smoking. Those eligible—people who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot—would get an extra dose at least six months after their second dose.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech submitted a request Nov. 9 to the FDA to expand the authorization of their Covid-19 booster to adults as young as 18 years old. The FDA could grant the authorization before the end of the year. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said that annual booster shots were likely and that the protection from the vaccine's third shot would probably fall after about a year.</p><p>An extra Covid-19 vaccine dose could mobilize more antibodies against the coronavirus, though the evidence supporting an additional dose isn't definitive. The immune system is complicated, involving more than antibodies. Other studies are still under way evaluating any benefit from an extra dose.</p><p>Data published in the New England Journal of Medicine from Israel, which began offering boosters to people over 60 in July, found that rates of infection and severe illness were substantially lower among study participants age 60 and over who had been vaccinated at least five months earlier and then received a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The study analyzed the medical records of 1.1 million people.</p><p>People with weakened immune systems might stand to benefit most from the additional dose. Shots were already available for some of these people, who are known as being immunocompromised. Those eligible include people who have received an organ transplant or are taking a drug that weakens their immune responses.</p><p>A number of countries have been rolling out boosters. Israel has made them available to people 12 years and older. In Europe, France and the U.K. have started giving boosters to older people and those with compromised immune systems. The European Medicines Agency has recommended boosters for adults.</p><p>Where can I get the booster shot?</p><p>Getting the booster will be similar to getting the initial course of vaccination, federal health officials said.</p><p>The vaccines are expected to be available at some 80,000 locations around the U.S., including retail pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., as well as mass-vaccination sites and doctors' offices. The Biden administration and Pfizer have said that there should be enough supply for the boosters, which will be available at no cost to people in the U.S.</p><p>Will boosters better protect against Delta or other variants?</p><p>Researchers say the current vaccines appear to work well against variants of concern that have emerged so far. Yet they might not work as strongly against newer variants as they do against earlier ones. For that reason, people might want booster shots to ensure that they get the fullest level of protection possible against the variants. And they would want a third shot if any variants emerge that prove better able to evade current vaccines. Drugmakers are working on shots targeting variants.</p><p>Is it safe for me to get a booster shot from a different vaccine brand?</p><p>The CDC backed booster mixing and matching on Oct. 21, saying people can get a shot that is different from what they had received previously.</p><p>For immunocompromised people who already are authorized to get a third messenger RNA dose, the CDC says they should try to get the same type of vaccine as their first two shots but can mix and match if they have to.</p><p>The CDC's recommendation follows the FDA's authorization of mixing and matching on Oct. 20.</p><p>The permission to mix and match vaccines and boosters would help ensure doses are available to anyone who wants one, while also increasing options for fully vaccinated people, according to health authorities.</p><p>The FDA's mixing-and-matching decision was informed by a National Institutes of Health study that showed that receiving a different vaccine than the original one received boosted antibody levels across all three vaccine types, particularly among Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients.</p><p>The NIH study showed that J&amp;J vaccine recipients boosted with a Moderna dose saw a 76-fold increase in antibody levels, while a Pfizer booster increased antibody levels 35-fold and a J&amp;J dose increased antibody levels fourfold.</p><p>I got Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. What does this mean for me?</p><p>Any adult who got a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson at least two months after the single-dose shot, according to the FDA.</p><p>Advisers to the FDA had voted unanimously Oct. 15 to recommend the agency authorize an extra dose of J&amp;J, to shore up protection against the coronavirus.</p><p>The panel of outside doctors and experts voted to recommend that all adults who received a first dose of the J&amp;J vaccine should get the second dose at least two months later.</p><p>The committee members opted not to take a vote on whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get the J&amp;J booster shot, citing that evidence was too limited.</p><p>J&amp;J said studies found the booster increased protection. An international study, in which subjects received two doses of its vaccine, 56 days apart, found the two-dose series was 75% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 disease overall, and 94% effective in the U.S. portion of the study. And the two-dose series was 100% effective against severe to critical cases, J&amp;J said.</p><p>J&amp;J also said studies found that the second dose boosted levels of immune-system agents known as antibodies significantly in the weeks following the booster.</p><p>I've been vaccinated and had Covid-19. Does a booster shot make sense for me?</p><p>People who both had Covid-19 and are vaccinated don't need to rush to get the boosters now rolling out across the U.S., health experts say.</p><p>Several studies suggest that people who have had Covid-19 and were fully vaccinated have strong protection, including against variants, and probably don't need the boost. Such research is preliminary and data is incomplete, according to scientists who specialize in vaccines and immunology. More is known about people who had Covid-19 and then were vaccinated, scientists said, than those who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections.</p><p>Can I get the flu vaccine and a Covid-19 booster shot at the same time?</p><p>The CDC says that flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines can be given together. It also recommends that everyone age 6 months and older receive a flu shot by the end of October because flu activity peaks December through February. Health experts have warned that the coming flu season is on track to be worse than the last cycle as Covid-19 restrictions that also helped prevent the spread of the flu virus are eased.</p><p>What about people with weakened immune systems?</p><p>The FDA had already authorized the additional dose for certain people with compromised immune systems. Research shows that immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19, are more likely to transmit it to household contacts and more likely to have breakthrough infections.</p><p>The immunocompromised include transplant recipients, some cancer survivors and people living with HIV; their weakened immune systems make them less responsive to vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to provide protection. The elderly also tend to have weaker immune systems, and they are also likely candidates for boosters.</p><p>Why wouldn't Covid-19 immunity last?</p><p>Studies suggest and many researchers say the immunity provided by Covid-19 vaccines will wane over time.</p><p>The vaccines work by generating neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating.</p><p>Pfizer has said that antibody levels start to decline from their earlier peaks about eight months after the second dose. After a third shot, antibody levels were up more than five times among people ages 18 to 55 and more than 11 times in people ages 65 to 85, compared with two doses, according to Pfizer's data.</p><p>Even with reduced antibodies, vaccines are protecting against severe disease, according to researchers and published research. That is because the vaccines help other immune-system weapons: the T-cells that hunt down infected cells and destroy them, and memory B-cells, which circulate in the blood and help churn out antibodies upon detecting a virus. Both are likely helping prevent severe disease, according to researchers.</p><p>Peter Loftus contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com and Jared S.
