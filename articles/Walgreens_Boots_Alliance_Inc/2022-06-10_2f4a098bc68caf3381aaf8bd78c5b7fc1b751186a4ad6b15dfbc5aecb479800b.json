  "title": "Rising Costs Weigh on Leveraged Buyouts",
  "text": "<p>As a result, some private-equity firms are choosing not to make bids for companies they were considering or are looking to do deals using more equity, according to deal makers and their advisers. Some banks, meanwhile, have chosen to drop out of financing packages for fear they will be unable to unload the loans to investors.</p><p>Leveraged-loan volume, after a torrid January, has slowed dramatically as the Fed raises rates to curb inflation and stocks trade well below prior highs. Through May 25, companies issued some $51 billion of leveraged loans to fund private-equity buyouts this year, down from about $65 billion during the same period last year, according to data from LCD.</p><p>Turmoil in the market has taken a toll on leveraged-buyout activity. So far this year, there has been $373 billion in private-equity deals announced in the U.S., including sales and purchases, down from some $570 billion in the same period last year, according to Dealogic.</p><p>A number of big potential deals in the works that have yet to be agreed upon hang in the balance. Possible targets include the software company Zendesk Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s Boots retail-pharmacy chain. Zendesk said Thursday that a strategic review had run its course without a deal, saying bidders cited \"adverse market conditions and financing difficulties at the end of the process.\"</p><p>\"It puts a lot of pressure on doing new deals,\" Jeffrey Ross, a partner at the law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, said of the downturn in the financing market. He works with firms including Carlyle Group Inc., TPG Inc. and Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice LLC on financing their transactions.</p><p>Lenders typically parcel out leveraged loans to institutional investors such as collateralized loan obligation managers and mutual funds, as well as to other banks. (Many of the biggest CLO managers are operated by the separately managed credit arms of the private-equity firms themselves.)</p><p>The loans are risky by nature because they are often taken out by companies with high debt loads; that risk is heightened in times of economic uncertainty such as these.</p><p>The market had been running at a brisk pace. In 2021, $146 billion in leveraged loans was issued for buyouts, the most since 2007. And last year was the biggest ever for private-equity deal making, with the volume of new purchases, asset sales and add-on deals exceeding $1 trillion, according to Dealogic.</p><p>In January of this year there were loans for deals such as the $17 billion agreement by Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman LLC to purchase health-care technology provider Athenahealth Inc., which required a nearly $7 billion term loan. In addition, a consortium including Advent International Corp. and Permira purchased the cybersecurity provider McAfee Corp. in a roughly $12 billion deal that required some $5 billion in leveraged loans.</p><p>Last month, by contrast, only $2.2 billion in leveraged loans was earmarked for buyouts, the smallest amount since July 2020 excluding the typically slow December period, LCD data show.</p><p>Unlike in Europe, where the syndicated-loan market has largely been closed for business since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, investors can still get the deals done in the U.S. if they are willing to pay higher prices.</p><p>That is in part because of the proliferation in recent years of private-credit funds, which don't have to syndicate out the debt and can provide capital from dedicated vehicles backed by investors keen on doing so. The move to take Zendesk private would likely have depend heavily on private-credit providers financing what would have been one of the largest LBOs of the year, according to people familiar with the deal.</p><p>Indeed, private credit has been behind some of the largest deals announced so far this year, including the $10.4 billion purchase of the software company Anaplan Inc.</p><p>Big private lenders such as Blackstone Inc.'s credit arm, Blue Owl Capital Inc. and Ares Management Corp. will likely continue to take market share from banks as shakiness sets in, according to market participants.</p><p>Private credit is usually more expensive than a traditional loan, but offers more certainty and stability in pricing.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
