  "text": "<p>Those requirements include no active cases for 14 days and sufficient staff and personal protective equipment.</p><p>The counties where long-term-care facilities are now eligible for indoor visits are Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem, said Ms. Persichilli.</p><p>\"This is good news. We are seeing outbreaks in our long-term-care facilities decrease,\" Ms. Persichilli said.</p><p>Vaccinations are also continuing at long-term-care facilities across the state, Ms. Persichilli said.</p><p>So far, the federal effort to administer inoculations at nursing homes led by CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has resulted in more than 230,000 long-term-care residents and staff in New Jersey getting vaccinated, she said.</p><p>Overall, the state has administered 1.76 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>New Jersey's seven-day average of Covid-19 cases was 2,934 on Tuesday, one of the lowest figures since mid-November. There were 2,070 people hospitalized on Tuesday with Covid-19 or probable cases, the lowest level since mid-November.</p><p>Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the falling infection rates mean restaurants would be permitted to raise their indoor dining capacity to 50% \"sooner rather than later.\"</p><p>The new variants of Covid-19, however, could complicate the easing of additional restrictions, depending on the infection rates, he added.</p><p>In New York, the daily positivity rate for Covid-19 tests on Tuesday fell to 2.85%, the lowest level since November 21. There were also 5,876 people hospitalized with Covid-19 in the state on Tuesday.</p><p>\"New Yorkers have shown courage and fortitude in the face of this unprecedented pandemic, and it's thanks to them that we're seeing a decline in hospitalizations and in the Covid positivity rate,\" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.</p>",
