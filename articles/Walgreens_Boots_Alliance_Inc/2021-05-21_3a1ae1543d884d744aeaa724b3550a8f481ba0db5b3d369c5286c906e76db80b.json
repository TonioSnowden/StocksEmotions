  "text": "<p>The situation is creating consternation for some as the U.S. aims to speed its vaccination campaign.</p><p>\"I was just on a call with doctors from other states and people were, like, 'Maybe we do, maybe we don't' \" require parental consent for various ages, said Elizabeth Mack, a pediatric critical-care physician who is vice president of the South Carolina chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>\"I think most people just want to get shots out the door and are getting consent from everyone rather than trying to sort it out,\" she said.</p><p>Getting young Americans vaccinated is viewed by health officials as a critical step in fully reopening schools and restarting the U.S. economy. Only the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE is cleared for use in minors, including teens aged 16 to 18. There are 25 million kids between the ages of 12 and 17, according to U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a group focused on children's welfare.</p><p>Young people now make up a bigger share of Covid-19 cases. The number of children who cumulatively have tested positive for the disease increased 3% in the two-week period ended May 13, while children comprised 24% of cases reported last week, according to data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The definition of child relative to the data varies based on each state's statutes.</p><p>The disease is generally less severe in younger people, who comprise a far smaller share of Covid-19-related deaths and hospitalizations than older Americans, though increasingly people hospitalized for the disease are age 50 or younger, according to national data.</p><p>CVS Health Corp. is requiring all minors to have a parent or guardian's permission to receive a shot, no matter the state laws. The pharmacy chain asks vaccine recipients to disclose their age. Customers aren't required to provide age documentation, although anyone younger than 16 must be accompanied by an adult.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., makes an exception in South Carolina for 16- and 17-year-olds, because 16 is the state's age of consent for medical procedures including vaccines. Elsewhere, Walgreens requires anyone younger than 18 to have a parent or guardian present at vaccinations. The chain won't turn people away if they don't have proof of identity, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Children generally follow their parents' wishes when it comes to healthcare, medical providers say. With vaccines in particular, the more likely conflict is a parent who wants a child to receive a shot and a child who resists, family doctors say.</p><p>But Covid-19 vaccines have created family splits for a few reasons.</p><p>The vaccine's status as a new drug approved under the Food and Drug Administration's emergency-use authorization has some parents nervous. Hesitancy is high among some segments of the population, creating fissures between parents and children who hold opposing views.</p><p>Teens see powerful motivators in gaining vaccinated status. Once-routine freedoms -- from school sports to summer camp to attending concerts -- might now require a shot. Other children are rattled by the thought of getting sick or infecting a loved one.</p><p>\"There's a lot more emphasis on getting the Covid vaccine than on other vaccines,\" said Arin Parsa, the 13-year-old founder of the advocacy group Teens for Vaccines. \"Schools have shut down, teens can't go outside. They care about their parents or other older family members in the household.\"</p>",
