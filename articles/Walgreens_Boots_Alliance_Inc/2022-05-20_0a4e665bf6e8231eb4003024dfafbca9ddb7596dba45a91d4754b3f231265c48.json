  "title": "U.S. News:  Baby Formula Aid Stumbles,  Prompting Program Revamp  ----  By Annie Gasparro and Jaewon Kang",
  "text": "<p>   A nationwide baby-formula shortage has exposed the shortcomings of a multibillion-dollar government program aimed at providing formula at no cost to families, said lawmakers and recipients, prompting efforts to revamp it. </p><p>   Some low-income parents who rely on the federal Women, Infants and Children program said shortages of approved baby formula have left them paying hundreds of dollars to purchase formula outside the program, while they navigate a patchwork of changes made to the WIC program in recent months in response to shortages. </p><p>   A February recall of Similac powdered infant formulas left grocery shelves largely bare in many states where that brand was dominant. Other manufacturers, such as Enfamil supplier Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, haven't been able to make up the difference after Similac's owner, Abbott Laboratories, paused production at the factory that made the recalled formula. </p><p>   President Biden said Wednesday that he is requiring suppliers to send ingredients to infant-formula makers before other customers, invoking the Defense Production Act. The White House also directed government agencies to use Department of Defense commercial aircraft to pick up from overseas infant formula that meets U.S. standards. </p><p>   Government officials have said the shortage is especially acute for families who rely on subsidies from the government's WIC program, which provides food and health assistance. Under WIC, which is federally funded but administered by the states, each state contracts with a single infant formula manufacturer to supply the program at a discount, and WIC recipients aren't able to switch to a different brand if the state-contracted provider's brand is sold out. </p><p>   About 21% of powdered baby formula was out of stock in U.S. stores as of early May, according to research firm IRI. More retailers, including Giant Eagle Inc. and Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket LLC, are introducing purchase limits on formula, joining bigger chains such as Kroger Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. </p><p>   Supporting about half of the nation's infants, WIC is the largest buyer of infant formula in the U.S., making up more than half of annual formula sales, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program. Of the $6 billion total program, roughly $1 billion is typically used on infant formula after rebates, according to market research and USDA data. </p><p>   \"Over the last several months, the federal government has worked round the clock to address the production shortfall brought about by the recall . . . and offer maximum flexibility, information, and support to WIC participants,\" USDA officials said in a statement. </p><p>   In response to the shortage, the USDA began working with states in February to allow WIC recipients to purchase alternative formulas, such as store brands, as well as different sizes or varieties that aren't normally covered by WIC. But the USDA said last week not all states have enacted all of the waivers, which expire in August. </p><p>   Abbott has contracts for supplying WIC in 34 states, all of which have adopted the waivers, according to the USDA. </p><p>   The Senate passed a bill by unanimous consent Thursday that would allow participants using WIC benefits to purchase alternative brands, and give the USDA the ability to automatically waive restrictions that limit how much participants in a food nutrition program can spend on baby formula. The House passed the bill Wednesday. It goes to President Biden for his signature. </p><p>   Historically, the system has created a greater reliance on WIC-approved formula manufacturers by requiring states to contract a single supplier, thus giving the winning company a majority of market share. The arrangement saves states money by incorporating volume discounts. But it leaves the system at risk of a meltdown if one of the few suppliers with these contracts can't meet demand, lawmakers said. </p><p>   Liliana Cardona said she is buying whatever formula she can find near her home in Waterbury, Conn., sometimes buying products at stores like Rite Aid not covered by her WIC benefits. She said she has spent about $150 of her own money in a month on formula. </p><p>   She said that it has been nerve-racking trying different formulas with her 4-month-old son, and that the shortages have prompted her to try to produce breast milk again. \"I'm excited for him to be 6 months [old], so he can start eating solids,\" Ms. Cardona said. </p><p></p>",
