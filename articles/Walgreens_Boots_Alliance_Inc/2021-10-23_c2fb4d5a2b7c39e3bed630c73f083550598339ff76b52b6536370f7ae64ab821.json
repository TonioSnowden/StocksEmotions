  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Ex-Pfizer Scientist Had Qualms About Theranos",
  "text": "<p>Dr. Weber described Friday the due diligence he went through in 2008 to assess Theranos's technology and determine whether his company would have any use for it, including reviewing findings from a Theranos study involving cancer patients. Dr. Weber eventually decided that Pfizer shouldn't get into business with Theranos and raised questions about the accuracy of its claims.</p><p>As part of his vetting process, Dr. Weber reviewed a document from Theranos that presented findings from a 15-month study beginning in 2007 which measured how 27 late-stage cancer patients responded to treatment. The Theranos devices were provided to patients to use at home, and their data was shared through the internet, with a cellphone or by landline phone, the document shows.</p><p>The findings showed huge variations between the subjects in the study, but Theranos failed to adequately explain why there was this variation, Dr. Weber testified. He conferred with colleagues who led oncology studies for Pfizer, and they told him they had no interest in using Theranos's technology, Dr. Weber said.</p><p>He had other concerns, which he later laid out in a seven-page report he shared internally at Pfizer: The startup made unconvincing arguments about its accomplishments, and the nine conclusions in Theranos's cancer study report were \"not believable.\"</p><p>For instance, one of Theranos's conclusions in its study is that \"the Theranos System performed with superior performance.\" Dr. Weber testified in court that he didn't agree with that.</p><p>More than a year after Pfizer passed on a collaboration with Theranos, Ms. Holmes in April 2010 emailed Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. executives a nearly identical copy of that cancer-patient study that Dr. Weber had reviewed. Theranos struck a partnership with Walgreens in 2013 to put its blood-testing devices in drugstores.</p><p>In this instance, according to the email that was displayed in court, Ms. Holmes claimed the report was an independent due diligence report on Theranos technology. The study had an important difference from the version Dr. Weber reviewed: the image of the Pfizer logo at the top of each page.</p><p>Dr. Weber said Friday the logo was added without Pfizer's permission. He said before prosecutors showed him the document, he hadn't been aware of its existence.</p><p>After Dr. Weber told Ms. Holmes in January 2009 that Pfizer wouldn't be using its machines, Ms. Holmes \"asked for other names at Pfizer to approach and I politely deflected,\" according to an email he sent to his superiors that was displayed in court. Dr. Weber also said his supervisors had agreed with his decision to pass on Theranos.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's lawyers have argued that her only crime is running a failed startup and that she lost everything when Theranos shut down in 2018.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
