  "text": "<p>US stocks have shed about $9tn this year as the Federal Reserve's attempt to rein in runaway inflation and mounting concerns over global growth sent investors dashing away from the world's biggest equities market.</p> <p>The market value of the S&amp;P 1500 index, a broad barometer of the US stock market, has tumbled from $45.8tn at the end of 2021 to $36.6tn by the end of trading yesterday on Wall Street, Bloomberg data show.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which tracks shares in America's biggest companies, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abb8a9f6-e57f-4a54-bb17-14a2c489831f\">slumped by about a fifth in 2022</a>, leaving it on course to record its worst performance for the first six months of a year since 1970.</p> <p>The slump in fortunes for investors was underlined yesterday by the world's leading central bankers who warned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c686df6-823b-49c2-bf0e-80e119d9e80a\">the era of low interest rates and moderate inflation is over</a>. </p> <p>Speaking at the European Central Bank's annual conference in Sintra, Portugal, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell warned of “some pain” to come for developed economies as central banks try to tame raging inflation but said it would be worse if price rises went unchecked.</p> <p>“The process is highly likely to involve some pain, but the worst pain would be from failing to address this high inflation and allowing it to become persistent,” he said.</p> <p>In China, however, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8739e5e0-104a-4458-8389-d25c5adc019e\">investors are more optimistic</a>. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks is on course for the biggest monthly gain in almost two years. This week the government in Beijing halved the quarantine period <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d52d545-0da7-4e01-931f-969b68da2150\">for international travellers</a>, raising hopes the worst of a lockdown-induced economic shock has passed.</p> <p>There are also signs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59e7e32b-66b5-4fe8-8a7b-1da57adfd556\">merger and acquisition activity is returning</a>, with deals worth more than $10bn up 12 per cent in the first half of 2022 compared with the same period last year.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

Economists also estimate the annual increase edged down to 4.8 per cent, from 4.9 per cent in April.
