  "title": "U.S. News: Schools, Pediatricians Gearing Up For Rollout of Children's Vaccine",
  "text": "<p>Pharmacists, who normally don't give vaccines to children in many states, will also help, after Congress granted them permission to administer Covid-19 vaccines to most children during the pandemic. CVS Health Corp . and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc . expect to offer the vaccine, as do community pharmacies.</p><p>Federal officials and states are planning for a rollout that could get under way in early to mid-November. The two-dose vaccine from Pfizer Inc . and partner BioNTech SE is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration .</p><p>Facing no supply concerns and having honed Covid-19 vaccine distribution over the past year, state and public-health officials say they anticipate a smoother rollout than with adults, when early demand outstripped supply, overwhelming pharmacies and other providers. These officials also are encouraged by how the pediatric Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine will be shipped in smaller packages than the doses for adults and can be refrigerated for up to 10 weeks instead of needing ultracold freezers that most doctors' offices lack. As a result, practices can use more doses before they expire, reducing potential waste.</p><p>\"This is going to be logistically a little bit easier than it was with the adults,\" said Claire Hannan , executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.</p><p>Still, state and public-health officials say thousands of doctors and nurses who haven't yet given Covid-19 vaccines will need to learn how to order and administer the shots. Another challenge is predicting how many parents will vaccinate their children. Polls show many parents haven't decided. About one-third of 217 parents of kids 5 to 11 surveyed recently by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they plan to wait to see how the shot performs before inoculating their children.</p><p>States are weighing where to send vaccines based on whether parents are comfortable sending their children to get vaccinated at school with permission slips or want to discuss the shot with a healthcare worker before making decisions. Some states are surveying doctors' offices about administering vaccines and helping them sign onto Covid-19 vaccination programs.</p><p>Virginia expects only about one-quarter of its schools to offer on-site vaccination, citing communities that are vaccine hesitant and schools that have limited staff, said Danny Avula, the state's vaccination liaison. He predicted about half of the 723,000 eligible kids in the state will be vaccinated in the first few months. \"I don't think the uptake will be that significant,\" Dr. Avula said.</p><p>The Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine appeared to safely generate a robust immune response in children 5 to 11 years in a Phase 3 trial, according to the drugmakers. The FDA confirmed the data on Friday.</p><p>An advisory panel to the FDA meets Tuesday to discuss the Pfizer clinical trial data for the children, and an FDA decision could come within days. Then, after an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meets and issues a recommendation, distribution could begin.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech are furthest ahead with development of a vaccine for children under 12 years old. Moderna Inc . is conducting a clinical trial while Johnson &amp; Johnson has yet to begin one.</p><p>Some children's hospitals will offer vaccines and join with community and religious groups, according to federal officials. Most hospitals, which played a major role during the initial U.S. vaccination rollout, will sit out pediatric vaccinations because they are short-staffed and overwhelmed due to recent surges in Covid-19 patients, public-health officials said.</p><p>Many schools are used to administering vaccines, particularly in rural areas. The Juneau, Alaska, school district plans to place vaccine clinics in elementary schools.</p><p>\"We'll continue to have clinics until we see demand go down,\" said Kristin Bartlett, chief of staff at Juneau School District.</p>",
