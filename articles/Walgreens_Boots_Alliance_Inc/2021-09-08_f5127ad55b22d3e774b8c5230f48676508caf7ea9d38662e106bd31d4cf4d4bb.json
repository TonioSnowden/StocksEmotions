  "title": "Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes's Trial Begins With Prosecution Statement; Prosecutors allege Holmes turned to fraud to maintain financial backing for the blood-testing startup",
  "text": "<p>Three years after the federal charges that ushered in the dissolution of Theranos, Mr. Leach laid out the government's case against Ms. Holmes, 37 years old, a Stanford University dropout whose charisma helped vault the blood-testing startup's valuation to over $9 billion before its implosion over questions about its technology.</p><p>Over about 45 minutes, Mr. Leach told jurors Ms. Holmes defrauded patients and investors with claims of revolutionary blood-testing technology that could test for a wide range of health conditions using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. Those claims helped draw in board members like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and major investors including former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp., owner of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>In fact, Mr. Leach said, the company's technology didn't work and Ms. Holmes knew it.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's lawyers portrayed her as a hardworking entrepreneur whose only fault was that her company, like many startups, didn't succeed.</p><p>\"Failure is not a crime,\" said Lance Wade, an attorney with Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly LLP. \"Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime.\" He said Ms. Holmes spent 15 years dedicated to the quest of improving lab testing and never sold a single share in the company that she owned, evidence of her commitment to the mission.</p><p>Mr. Wade said Ms. Holmes, who started Theranos at age 19, was naive at times about challenges facing her business, but \"she genuinely, deeply believed it would be successful.\"</p><p>She has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The maximum penalty for each wire fraud count is 20 years in prison.</p><p>The opening remarks were the first opportunity for the former chief executive's lawyers and prosecutors with the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of California to influence the jury of five women and seven men in a trial expected to last more than three months. The trial will feature weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses, including potentially from Ms. Holmes herself.</p><p>The Journal's investigative reporting in 2015 and 2016 exposed how Theranos's technology didn't work, how the blood-testing company tried to cover up its failures and how patients' lives were affected and their health jeopardized.</p><p>Government prosecutors described Ms. Holmes as willing to cut corners and cheat to raise the funding needed to keep her company afloat. By 2013, Theranos was in \"a rush, a scramble,\" Mr. Leach told jurors, as its business partners Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Safeway Inc. waited for Theranos's miniature blood-testing machines to be rolled out to their customers in stores across the country.</p><p>The company had brought in half a million dollars in revenue in 2011, and no revenue at all in 2012 and 2013, Mr. Leach said, citing upcoming testimony from a top Theranos finance officer.</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Theranos executive Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani directed employees to alter commercial blood machines to work with small amounts of blood. \"This was a way to deceive Walgreens and Safeway, and to stall, and to buy time,\" Mr. Leach said.</p><p>The pair also courted the media to win favorable coverage about their miniature blood analyzers and used the publicity to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more from investors. They raised that money, prosecutors allege, based on a series of false and misleading statements, including that Theranos's technology had been blessed by major pharmaceutical companies and that it was being deployed by the American military on the battlefield to save soldiers' lives.</p><p>All told, the purported fraud made Ms. Holmes a billionaire, Mr. Leach said, one who graced magazine covers and was a lauded Silicon Valley executive.</p><p>\"This is a case about fraud, about lying and cheating to get money,\" Mr. Leach said.</p><p>To win a conviction, government lawyers must convince the jury that Ms. Holmes intended to commit fraud, not simply that the company ran into problems living up to its promises.</p><p>Mr. Leach told jurors he would show them \"email after email\" where issues were brought directly to Ms. Holmes's attention. She was a hands-on CEO, he said, and \"the buck stopped with her.\"</p><p>Mr. Leach said jurors would hear testimony from former employers, investors and patients who bought Theranos tests, Mr. Leach said. Many of the company's blood tests, he said, skewed the medical decisions of patients and put them at risk.</p><p>Theranos dissolved in 2018, months after Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani were indicted in the criminal case. By that point, the company also faced a wave of civil lawsuits from investors and patients, had reached a settlement along with Ms. Holmes with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was dogged by other regulatory issues.</p><p>Mr. Balwani faces a separate trial next year and has pleaded not guilty to the same charges as Ms. Holmes. The relationship between the two, which was at one point romantic, could play a prominent role at the trial. In court filings, Ms. Holmes's lawyers said the couple had an abusive relationship that affected her decision-making as head of Theranos. A lawyer for Mr. Balwani has denied any allegations of abuse.</p><p>Ms. Holmes's lawyers could reveal during opening statements whether they will use the relationship as part of a mental-health defense. Potential jurors in the case were questioned last week about whether they or anyone they are close to had personal experience with domestic violence, but weren't told why they were being asked.</p><p>Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com</p><p>Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes's Trial Begins With Prosecution Statement</p>",
