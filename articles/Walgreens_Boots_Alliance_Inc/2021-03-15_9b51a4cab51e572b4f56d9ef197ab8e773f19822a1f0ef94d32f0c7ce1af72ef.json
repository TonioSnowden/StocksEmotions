  "title": "Business News -- Boss Talk:  Starbucks' Mellody Hobson  Says Change Is Brewing  ----  By Heather Haddon",
  "text": "<p>\n   Mellody Hobson has seen corporate pledges to increase workplace diversity come and go over the years. Starbucks Corp.'s new chairwoman believes this time is different. </p><p>\n  As co-CEO and president of minority-run, asset-management firm Ariel Investments LLC, Ms. Hobson is one of the U.S.'s most prominent Black investors.  She will be the only Black chairwoman of an S&amp;P 500 company, when she assumes that role at Starbucks Wednesday. She's one of a handful of Black women to recently take on a leadership position in the highest echelons of U.S. corporations. Another is Rosalind Brewer, who was Starbucks' operating chief and will be Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s CEO Monday. </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson, 51 years old, rose from intern to the top of Chicago-based Ariel, which manages $15 billion in assets. She joined Starbucks' board nearly 16 years ago. She spoke to The Wall Street Journal from the southern California home she shares with her husband, filmmaker George Lucas. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   WSJ: What are your goals as chairwoman? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: My job is to partner with [CEO] Kevin Johnson to help the organization continue to scale to new heights. I'm the band leader. I'm a person of color and that adds a fascinating dimension to our story. I think that will be really powerful for our people. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What about for yourself? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: I have this friend who says being the first or only Black anything is a proud and lonely walk. I'm ecstatic, but I understand the importance of it. You have to do a good job so that there will be more opportunities for others. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Starbucks last year announced new management diversity goals. Where does that stand? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: It's not time for any kind of victory lap, but I know we have a plan. We're holding people accountable. I really give Kevin a lot of credit for tying performance around diversity to pay. That's where the rubber meets the road. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What have been hurdles to making those advancements? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: We've had this conversation in our boardroom for many, many years. Now, the work is very comprehensive and there's complete alignment. </p><p>\n  We have the worst problem -- where your good people get picked off. We just had that with [Rosalind Brewer]. Of course I didn't want to lose Roz at Starbucks, but the outcome is pretty great for her and for Black women. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Ariel launched an investment arm to help fund minority-owned service providers to companies. How diverse is Starbucks' supply chain? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: Business diversity includes all areas of corporate spending. About 2% of Fortune 500 spending right now is with minority business enterprises. Starbucks has been focusing on this for some time. Last year, we spent more than $600 million with diverse suppliers, about 8% of our spending. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: You've said we're in a \"civil rights 3.0\" phase in the U.S. What signs of real change do you see? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: The broader society is keeping score. There are consequences that exist for not living up to those commitments. It's going to be super hard to be a Fortune 500 company without a diverse person on your board. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What grade would you give the U.S. in terms of board diversity? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: B-minus. White men make up 30% of the U.S. population and 70% of the board seats. The reason it's not in the \"C\" category is because in the last year or so, there has been a sea change. I know how many calls I've gotten and how many people I've recommended. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Starbucks lost other executives lately. What does that mean for the executive bench? </p><p>\n  Ms. Hobson: We've had people retire. Covid also had people soul-searching about what they wanted to be. That said, I think the executive leadership team is strong. That's reflected in the success we've seen in the business, especially during a very challenging time. </p><p></p>",
