  "title": "Walgreens Names Brewer Chief,  Only Black Female CEO of Big Firm  ----  By Heather Haddon",
  "text": "<p>   Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is set to name Starbucks Corp. operating chief Roz Brewer as its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter, setting her up to be the only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company today. </p><p>   Ms. Brewer will succeed CEO Stefano Pessina, who said in July that he would step down as CEO once the drugstore company found a new leader. Mr. Pessina, one of the Walgreens' biggest individual investors, said he was planning to stay on the Walgreens board and serve as executive chairman. </p><p>   Starbucks, which said Tuesday that sales were recovering in China in particular even as the pandemic has necessitated continued store closures elsewhere, said Ms. Brewer would depart at the end of February. </p><p>   Ms. Brewer, 58 years old, was COO and a member of the board at Starbucks since 2017. She helped shift Starbucks toward a focus on to-go operations during the pandemic and worked to diversify leadership. </p><p>   Starbucks last fall said it would tie executive compensation to increasing minority representation in its workforce, and mandated antibias training for company leaders. Starbucks said CEO Kevin Johnson will continue to lead the company's diversity efforts. In March, the company is expected to appoint investor Mellody Hobson as its chairwoman, positioning the coffee chain to be among the biggest U.S. companies with a Black person leading its board. </p><p>   Starbucks's president of its North American business and chief marketing officer will assume Ms. Brewer's roles and report directly to Mr. Johnson, the CEO said on a call. </p><p>   \"We're very excited for her and are grateful for her many contributions over the years,\" Mr. Johnson said. </p><p>   Starbucks said Tuesday global same-store sales fell 5% in its quarter ended in December from the year-earlier period. A quarter earlier, sales by that measure fell 9% from a year earlier. Same-store sales in China increased 5% year over year in the latest quarter. </p><p>   Starbucks is still navigating restrictions imposed by local officials seeking to curb the new coronavirus's spread. Sales of $6.7 billion during the quarter were down 5% from a year earlier, with Starbucks attributing the decline to fewer customers, reduced hours and store closures related to the pandemic. Analysts polled by FactSet anticipated $6.9 billion in sales. </p><p>   Shares of Starbucks fell nearly 2% to $103 after hours. </p><p>   In China, where Starbucks stores were largely closed and sales plummeted when the pandemic took off there early in 2020, sales have largely bounced back with the broader economy. </p><p>   For the latest quarter, Starbucks reported adjusted earnings of 61 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations of 55 cents a share. Earnings of 53 cents a share, on income of $622 million, were down from 74 cents a year earlier, with Starbucks attributing the decrease to the pandemic. The company expects earnings of $2.42 to $2.62 a share for its full fiscal year, up slightly from previous guidance. </p><p></p>",
