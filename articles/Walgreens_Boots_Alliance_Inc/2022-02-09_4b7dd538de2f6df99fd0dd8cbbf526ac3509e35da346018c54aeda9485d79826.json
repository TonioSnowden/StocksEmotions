  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp. posted higher revenue in the holiday quarter, lifted by the more than 20 million Covid-19 vaccines it administered in the period.</p><p>With a boost from the vaccinations and the over 8 million Covid-19 testsCVS administered in the quarter, same-store sales grew by 13.4% from a year earlier, when the vaccines were just being authorized.</p><p>Both CVS and rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. have played prominent roles in the U.S. effort to distribute Covid-19 vaccines across the country. The drug-store chains have also been key to the federal effort to make available rapid, at-home Covid-19 tests, which were outstripped by demand in the latest quarter as Americans sought to get tested around the holidays.</p><p>In the three months ended Dec. 31, CVS said sales in its retail business rose 12.7% from a year earlier to $27.11 billion. Covid-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and the sale of over-the-counter test kits made up about 40% of the increase in the segment's revenue, the company said.</p><p>Staffing shortageshave stressed both CVS and Walgreens, as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have scrambled to juggle Covid-19 testing and vaccines with filling prescriptions and serving customers. CVS has said it hired nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses earlier this year to meet the demands.</p><p>The Woonsocket, R.I.-based pharmacy and healthcare company has seen its costs rise along with its sales over the past year. Total cost of products sold rose to $46.38 billion in the quarter, up from $42.45 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Still, the company posted a quarterly profit of $1.31 billion, or 98 cents a share, up from $973 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, the company posted earnings of $1.98 a share, beating analyst expectations of $1.83 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>CVS's total revenue, which includes its health-insurance and pharmacy-services businesses, grew by 10.1% from a year earlier to $76.60 billion, the company said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected sales of $75.66 billion.</p><p>The company's fourth-quarter results included an impairment charge of $1.4 billion related to the company's store-closure plan.</p><p>CVS said it expected to post full-year 2022 earnings from continuing operations between $7.04 a share and $7.24 a share. On an adjusted basis, it expects earnings to come in between $8.10 a share and $8.30 a share.</p><p>It also widened its full-year cash flow from operations guidance range to between $12 billion and $13 billion.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Posts Higher Revenue, Boosted by Covid-19 Vaccine Demand</p>",
