  "title": "Kohl's Ends Sale Talks, Looks to Unlock Value",
  "text": "<p>Kohl's Chairman Peter Boneparth said in an interview that recent choppiness in the financing market and the retail industry had made a deal unattainable. He added that the board has confidence in the company's management to execute its strategic plan. \"While there was criticism from activists, the vast majority of shareholders are supportive of the direction management is taking the company,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Boneparth said the company is exploring other ways to unlock value for shareholders, including by selling some real estate and buying back stock.</p><p>Inflation is driving interest rates higher and raising the cost of capital, slowing deal making from its record-setting pace last year. Earlier this week, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said it would keep its Boots and No7 Beauty Co. businesses after failing to receive adequate bids for its U.K. pharmacy chain.</p><p>On Friday Panera Brands Inc., owner of Panera Bread, Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels, said it was putting plans for an initial public stock offering on hold due to unfavorable market conditions.</p><p>Like other department stores, Kohl's, with about 1,100 stores, has struggled to attract shoppers amid rising competition from discounters, fast-fashion chains and online competitors. Despite efforts to woo shoppers by adding new brands, improving its loyalty program and offering features such as the ability to return items bought at Amazon.com Inc. to its stores, its recent performance has lagged behind some of its peers. It has attracted the attention of activist investors, who pushed unsuccessfully to overhaul its board.</p><p>In an interview Friday, Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass said the company is largely sticking with its playbook of rolling out Sephora shops in more than 850 of its stores by the end of 2023 and opening 100 smaller format stores over the next four years. \"Sephora is a game changer,\" she said.</p><p>Shares in Kohl's fell 20% to $28.68 Friday, as the retailer also cut its sales forecast in the current quarter amid a slowdown in consumer spending.</p><p>Kohl's board began to engage with advisers in late January after receiving informal inquiries about buying the department-store chain, the company said in a securities filing. Kohl's later launched a sale process and said it attracted interest from more than 25 parties. Bidders included private-equity firm Sycamore Partners and Canada's Hudson's Bay, owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, during a monthslong sales process, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>The retailer last month entered exclusive deal talks with Franchise Group, which owns retail brands like Vitamin Shoppe and Pet Supplies Plus. Franchise Group initially offered to pay $60 a share for Kohl's -- a deal valued at around $8 billion -- but ultimately reduced the price to $53 a share, without definitive financing to close the deal, Kohl's said.</p><p>The deal structure called for Franchise Group, which has a smaller market capitalization than Kohl's, to sell real estate and add on debt. Analysts have said that such structures contributed to the bankruptcies of Mervyn's, Sears Holdings Corp., Shopko Corp. and Toys \"R\" Us Inc.</p><p>Kohl's said Friday that the two sides \"faced significant obstacles reaching a fully executable agreement.\"</p><p>Franchise Group released a statement confirming that the deal talks ended, but said it is committed to evaluating opportunities that will enhance shareholder value. The company's stock closed down more than 7%, bringing its year-to-date decline to nearly 38%.</p><p>On Friday, Kohl's said inflation is cutting further into consumer spending and that it expects sales to fall at a high-single-digit rate in its second quarter, worse than prior expectations of a low-single-digit drop. The company also reaffirmed plans to conduct a $500 million accelerated stock buyback after its second-quarter earnings report, which is slated for Aug. 18.</p><p>\"The consumer is facing a lot of pressure, and we'll navigate that effectively,\" Ms. Gass said. \"We stand for value and have a lot of agility with pricing and promotions.\"</p><p>Analysts said Kohl's difficulties will likely deepen as the economy softens.</p><p>\"The challenge now for Kohl's is how to create new value going forward, beyond the Sephora and small-format initiatives at a time when retail sales are slowing and fears of a recession loom,\" said Craig Johnson, president of consulting firm Customer Growth Partners.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
