  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Employers Split on Abortion Coverage",
  "text": "<p>The type of health-insurance plans offered by large and midsize U.S. companies tend to include some abortion benefits. A federal antidiscrimination statute requires all employers that provide health insurance to cover an abortion if the life of the mother is at risk from the pregnancy.</p><p>Around 10% of covered U.S. workers are enrolled in plans offered by employers that specifically excluded or tightly restricted abortion coverage, according to a 2019 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>Large-employer plans diverge on whether employees are covered for an abortion when there isn't a health risk in carrying the pregnancy to full term. Smaller companies tend to have a type of insurance that is subject to state laws, which may or may not allow abortion coverage as part of plans.</p><p>Around 37% of companies cover at least some form of elective abortions, according to an early June survey of 400 companies of all sizes from consultant Mercer, a unit of Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. The survey isn't complete and many companies are only recently reviewing the details of their abortion coverage, said some of the Mercer executives involved in the research. \"It is hard to get firm data on what percentage of healthcare plans cover elective abortion and what don't,\" said Julie Campbell, a principal in Mercer's Health &amp; Benefits group. In recent days, some clients are reaching out to Mercer after discovering their abortion coverage is unintentionally narrow, she said.</p><p>Target, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. offer employee healthcare plans that cover abortion broadly, according to people familiar with the plans. Large banks and technology companies tend to cover the costs of abortion care for employees and family members under their plans, including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. The companies are among those that have also promised to reimburse employees for travel related to abortion and other healthcare services.</p><p>Walmart's 2022 employee benefits document states: \"Charges for procedures, services, drugs, and supplies related to abortions or termination of pregnancy are not covered, except when the health of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, the fetus could not survive the birthing process, or death would be imminent after birth.\"</p><p>Walmart, the biggest private employer in the country with around 1.7 million U.S. staffers, doesn't cover the cost of emergency contraception such as Plan B unless prescribed by a doctor, according to the documents. Medications such as Plan B, which are intended to prevent pregnancy up to 3 days after unprotected sex, are available for purchase without a prescription.</p><p>In a memo to staff on Friday, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said the company was getting input from employees and reviewing its policies following the Supreme Court's decision. \"No matter what your position on this topic is, we want you to feel respected, valued and supported,\" he wrote in the memo. \"We will share details on our actions as soon as possible, recognizing that time is of the essence.\"</p><p>Walmart's policies on abortion coverage closely mirror abortion laws in Arkansas, where the retailer is based. When the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, Arkansas's attorney general enacted a so-called trigger law that outlaws abortion in all cases except to protect the life of the mother.</p><p>---</p><p>Lauren Weber contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
