  "title": "CVS to Pay $5 Billion to Settle Opioid Lawsuits; Drugstore chain agrees to make payments over 10 years to states, cities and tribes that sued over opioid abuse",
  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp. has agreed to pay about $5 billion in a landmark settlement that the company says would resolve all remaining opioid-crisis lawsuits brought by states, cities and other governments.</p><p>The largest U.S. drugstore company is the first pharmacy chain to reach a settlement in the collection of lawsuits brought by governments and Native American tribes blaming CVS and rival pharmacies for helping fuel the nation's opioid epidemic.</p><p>Under the proposed deal, CVS would pay $4.9 billion to states and municipalities and $130 million to tribes over the next 10 years starting in 2023. The company said the agreement isn't an admission of guilt and that it would continue to defend against any litigation that the settlement doesn't resolve. Each state, local government and tribe still must decide whether to participate in the settlement.</p><p>The company, in a statement, said it is pleased to have resolved the claims and outlined steps it has taken to combat opioid abuse. CVS has been in a separate legal battle with its insurers over whether they should cover some of the liability the company faces for the opioid lawsuits.</p><p>Widespread opioid abuse has claimed more than half a million lives and triggered more than 3,000 lawsuits by governments, hospitals and others against players in the pharmaceutical industry, including manufacturers, distributors and drugstores.</p><p>Many of the lawsuits allege that pharmacies didn't do enough to stem the flow of pills into communities. The drugstores have argued that they had tried to stop pills from being illegally diverted and followed procedures required by regulators.</p><p>In August, a federal judge in Ohio ordered CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Walmart Inc. to pay $650 million over 15 years to two Ohio counties after a jury found the companies liable for contributing to the opioid epidemic.</p><p>That case, closely watched by attorneys elsewhere, was the first decision reached among opioid lawsuits targeting the pharmacy chains. The judge's order came following a six-week trial; the companies said at the time that they planned to appeal the decision.</p><p>In March, CVS agreed to pay $484 million to settle opioid-related claims by the state of Florida, without admitting wrongdoing. Walgreens later agreed to pay $683 million to settle the Florida lawsuit without admitting wrongdoing. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid Corp. also settled with two New York counties in 2021 for a combined $26 million.</p><p>A Walgreens spokesman declined to comment. Representatives from Rite Aid and Walmart weren't immediately available.</p><p>In 2021, a group of states reached a roughly $25 billion settlement with Johnson &amp; Johnson and drug distributors including McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc. The deal was finalized this summer.</p><p>J&amp;J said its $5 billion payment wasn't an admission of liability. The drug distributors, which are paying about $20 billion over 18 years, said they disputed the allegations against them. Cities and counties have said they would use the money to bolster social services focused on the harms of opioid addiction as well as for funds for first responders.</p><p>Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP and grew wealthy from sales of OxyContin agreed earlier this year to pay up to $6 billion to settle lawsuits accusing them of helping fuel the opioid-addiction epidemic. The settlement came after an earlier $4.5 billion settlement was overturned by a federal judge.</p><p>The family didn't admit liability but will cede control of Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and pleaded guilty in 2020 to three federal felonies related to the marketing and sale of OxyContin.</p><p>CVS said spreading out the settlement payments would allow it to continue to invest in its business. The company for years has worked to transform itself from a pharmacy chain to an integrated provider of medical services, with the biggest step being its 2018 acquisition of insurer Aetna. In September, CVS agreed to buy home-care provider Signify Health Inc. in an all-cash $8 billion deal.</p><p>The company reported $5.2 billion in opioid-litigation charges for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Those charges, combined with a $2.5 billion loss on assets held for sale to write-down the long-term care business, led CVS to a $3.9 billion operating loss in the period compared with $3.1 billion in operating income a year ago.</p><p>Also Wednesday, the company reported a 10% sales increase for the quarter ended Sept. 30 and raised its financial outlook for the full year even as demand has slowed for Covid-19 vaccines and tests.</p><p>CVS said sales were $81.2 billion for the quarter as revenue grew across all segments, including a 9.9% increase in the insurance business and a 6.9% gain in the pharmacy business aided by higher prices, purchases of at-home Covid-19 test kits and more prescription sales.</p><p>The company raised its earnings-per-share guidance for the calendar year to $3.12 to $3.22 from $7.23 to $7.43. It now expects cash flow from operations to be $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>CVS to Pay $5 Billion to Settle Opioid Lawsuits</p>",
