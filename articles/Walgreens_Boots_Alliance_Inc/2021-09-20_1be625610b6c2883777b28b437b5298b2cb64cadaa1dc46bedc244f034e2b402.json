  "title": "CVS Makes Hiring Push Amid Worker Shortage, Increased Covid-19 Vaccine Demand; Pharmacy chain plans to add 25,000 people this week as stores struggle with long lines, frustrated customers",
  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp., one of the biggest U.S. providers of Covid-19 tests and vaccines, is racing to hire thousands of workers as staffing shortages prompt stores to close drive-through lanes and at times turn away customers seeking shots.</p><p>The largest U.S. pharmacy chain by stores said it plans to add 25,000 employees this week in a single-day hiring spree to prepare for a potential surge in demand from booster shots and as more people seek Covid-19 tests and flu vaccines.</p><p>CVS employees and customers at some locations have described chaotic stores, hourslong lines and phones that go unanswered as the chain addresses a national labor shortage. Companies in sectors from retail to manufacturing are having a hard time filling jobs, leading to deteriorating service, production slowdowns and burnout among staff.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What staffing shortages have you seen at businesses in your area? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The worker shortfall at CVS, also hitting rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., is being exacerbated by rising demand for Covid-19 tests as people begin to seek flu vaccines ahead of what health officials predict will be a severe influenza season.</p><p>\"This is testing our role in the community,\" said Neela Montgomery, who has been president of CVS's pharmacy retail unit since November. \"But provided we staff up the way we intend to, we're going to make our way through this.\"</p><p>Ms. Montgomery said CVS is administering more tests than it was at the height of the pandemic as Covid-19 cases rise and as more employers, schools and other entities require unvaccinated workers, students and customers to produce negative test results.</p><p>Demand for flu shots is already higher than usual, she said, and the company didn't initially anticipate that the booster-shot rollout would converge with flu season. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday endorsed booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine for adults older than 65 years and those at high risk of severe disease.</p><p>CVS employees, in interviews and posts on social media, have described short-staffed pharmacies, customers lashing out during long waits and workers quitting out of stress.</p><p>Kate-Madonna Sieger, of Lakeville, Minn., said that when her 9-year-old son exhibited potential Covid-19 symptoms a few weeks ago, she visited three CVS pharmacies and each said there was no pharmacist on duty to administer a test. Ms. Sieger, 39, who is receiving treatment for breast cancer, also said she received an expired, but ultimately harmless, prescription last month from the CVS she regularly frequents.</p><p>\"I called the pharmacist to ask him how this could have happened and he said, 'We're really short-staffed, and we're really sorry,'\" she said. \"I have nothing against CVS but that's concerning.\"</p><p>A CVS spokesman said staffing issues aren't systemic.</p><p>\"We're always going to have in pockets some staffing issues that may unfortunately cause some service issues,\" Ms. Montgomery said. \"But we are very focused on deploying district and regional teams to support those stores when they are understaffed. That is one of the advantages of having 10,000 stores.\"</p><p>Walgreens, which has shortened store operating hours in some cases because of staffing shortages, on Friday announced cash awards to pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. A company spokeswoman said Walgreens overall had had, \"minimal disruption.\"</p><p>The company will pay $1,000 \"certification awards\" to be paid out over a six-month period to pharmacy technicians who are or become certified to administer flu and Covid-19 vaccines, along with bonuses of $1,250 for full-time pharmacists and $1,000 to part time pharmacists.</p><p>The U.S. has relied heavily on retail pharmacies for nationwide Covid-19 testing and vaccine distribution through a federal partnership with nearly two dozen retail pharmacy chains, including Walmart Inc., Kroger Co. and Rite Aid Corp., as well as CVS and Walgreens.</p><p>The participating companies have administered roughly one-third of the more than 300 million doses administered since vaccines became available at the end of 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CVS and Walgreens, with some 19,000 U.S. locations between them, have delivered the bulk of those shots. CVS said it has given 34 million doses to date.</p><p>The CDC said in a statement that the agency is working closely with pharmacies to ensure they are prepared to administer booster and flu shots this fall. It said unlike at the height of the pandemic, supply isn't a problem, and providers are well-versed in storing and administering shots.</p><p>CVS, more than other chains, has expanded the size and scope of its pharmacy business in recent years. The chain has begun offering medical services from diagnostics to mental-health counseling in stores. It also has taken on more business as regional and grocery chains go out of business.</p><p>CVS has taken steps to attract more workers. The chain in August said it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $15, with increases starting this summer and fully implemented by July. The company also said it would eliminate the grade-point-average requirement for university recruitment this year. It has done away with the high-school diploma or General Education Development requirement for most entry-level roles.</p><p>Walgreens also has announced plans to raise starting pay to $15 an hour, beginning in October and fully implemented by November 2022.</p><p>Ms. Montgomery, CVS's pharmacy chief, said the company encourages retail employees to enroll in its pharmacy technician training program in an effort to expand the pool of workers. Pharmacy technicians are certified to assist pharmacists in filling prescriptions and can answer customer questions.</p><p>The hiring event, planned for Friday, aims to fill 19,000 open positions while adding another 6,000 jobs at roughly 10,000 locations nationwide. Pharmacy technicians will comprise 14,000 of the new hires, with the remaining jobs going to pharmacists, nurses and retail workers. CVS's pharmacy operations, which include distribution centers, operational roles and clinics as well as store and pharmacy workers, employ 200,000.</p><p>Job seekers can start the application process via text or on the company's website, try out for the job virtually and potentially get hired immediately, the company said. CVS isn't accepting in-person applications.</p><p>Pharmacy technician wages start at $16 an hour. Pharmacy techs make $17.50 an hour on average in the U.S., with higher pay going to those who work in hospitals, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A pharmacy tech working at a retail setting makes $16.55 an hour on average while the same job in a hospital averages $19.80 an hour.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Makes Hiring Push Amid Worker Shortage, Increased Covid-19 Vaccine Demand</p>",
