  "title": "Theranos ex-President Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani's Fraud Case Goes to Jury; Deliberations begin over whether blood-testing startup executive lied to investors and patients",
  "text": "<p>The conclusion of testimony and arguments in the white-collar case follows a marathon four days of closing arguments. Mr. Balwani's defense spent more than 11 hours making its case to the jury that Mr. Balwani, who was the longtime chief operating officer of the defunct blood-testing startup Theranos, acted in good faith and was honest in his dealings, that Theranos technology showed promise and that the government's witnesses were unreliable or dishonest.</p><p>The government, which made its closing arguments Tuesday, took the opportunity to make a rebuttal Friday. A prosecutor told the jury that Mr. Balwani withheld information from investors and business partners, including the fact that Theranos used commercial blood analyzers for the majority of its tests. The prosecution said he repeatedly overstated Theranos's technological capabilities and accuracy and knowingly gave dishonest revenue projections to investors.</p><p>A Theranos Timeline: The Downfall of Elizabeth Holmes, a Silicon Valley Superstar</p><p>Mr. Balwani, 57, has been charged with 12 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. A guilty verdict on any of these counts could send him to prison for years. The jury sat through three months of trial, including testimony from 24 government witnesses and two witnesses called in Mr. Balwani's defense.</p><p>Theranos rose to be a one-time Silicon Valley startup superstar with claims that it had created technology to revolutionize healthcare with a small device that could test for more than 200 health conditions using just a finger prick of blood, rendering traditional blood-drawing methods obsolete. The prosecution told jurors that Mr. Balwani and Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos's founder and chief executive, together deceived investors and patients about the capabilities and prospects of their startup. Theranos's device was at most used to test patients for 12 health conditions and secretly used commercial blood analyzers to run most of its blood tests</p><p>Starting in October 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Theranos had relied on conventional machines for most blood tests, struggled with accuracy problems, deceived its investors and corporate partners including Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., skirted regulators and put patients at risk. The company was hit with civil lawsuits, regulatory inspections and sanctions and was dissolved in September 2018. Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes were indicted together in June 2018.</p><p>Mr. Balwani was in charge of the company's lab, the center of Theranos's operations, and was an officer on the board of directors and wielded enormous power and influence at the company, his trial showed.</p><p>\"Was there anyone more powerful at the company than those two? The answer is no,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bostic said of Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes during his rebuttal.</p><p>Frequent delays related to Covid cases among jurors and others involved in the trial slowed its start by a week and have dragged it out for 14 weeks. Jurors' summer-vacation schedules could further complicate the timeline. One seated juror is scheduled to be on vacation next week, and others have said they are unavailable in early July, which might interrupt deliberations.</p><p>The jury in Ms. Holmes's case deliberated for more than 50 hours before reaching a guilty verdict on four of the 11 fraud counts against her. Ms. Holmes is set to be sentenced in September.</p><p>Mr. Balwani didn't testify. After putting on just two witnesses in his defense, Mr. Balwani's attorney Jeffrey Coopersmith, used his closing arguments, which spanned three days, to tell the jury about Mr. Balwani's \"unwavering and sincere belief in the capability of Theranos technology\" and to try to undercut the government's case by calling certain witnesses liars or sowing doubt about their testimonies. Mr. Coopersmith showed the jury test results that suggested particular tests done on Theranos's device, including for sodium and iron, performed as well or better than other labs.</p><p>\"These results are almost perfect,\" Mr. Coopersmith said. \"It's where Theranos is actually doing the work to show that their assays are working as far as the laboratory staff and as far as Mr. Balwani know.\"</p><p>The government presented emails and other correspondence that showed Mr. Balwani was well-informed of the many problems in the lab he oversaw, and former employees testified that he rebuffed their concerns and routinely lost his temper with employees who raised alarms or disagreed with him.</p><p>The defense sought to raise doubt about the patients and healthcare providers who testified in the trial about receiving inaccurate test results. Mr. Coopersmith said one patient's testimony was based on his memory of how he felt on particular days rather than scientific data.</p><p>Mr. Coopersmith told the jury to question the intention of the investors who testified against Mr. Balwani. \"The wealthy, powerful investors that we heard from, they want to say, 'We were fooled,'\" he said. \"They look better in the eyes of their investors, their future investors, their family offices and their employers.\"</p><p>The government reminded the jury that allegations of investor negligence aren't a defense to wire fraud.</p><p>Mr. Bostic, one of the prosecutors, argued that Mr. Balwani repeatedly made the wrong choice and that he knew when he was being dishonest. Mr. Balwani showed investors revenue projections in October 2014—with just two months of the year remaining—that said the company would make $140 million for the year. In reality, its revenue for that year was $150,000, according to a document shown in court.</p><p>\"It was so far off the mark for that projection that you can be confident in viewing this as a dishonest projection,\" said Mr. Bostic.</p><p>Mr. Bostic described Mr. Balwani as influential throughout the company and even influenced Ms. Holmes's behavior at times. In a text message exchange shown in court, Mr. Balwani told Ms. Holmes that she shouldn't attempt to hide from Walgreens, a key business partner, that Theranos had stopped using its signature blood-collecting nanotainer device because the Food and Drug Administration declared it an unapproved medical device. Walgreens had already found out through a Journal article, so she wouldn't have gotten away with denying it, Mr. Bostic said.</p><p>\"This isn't honesty, this is strategy,\" Mr. Bostic said.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Theranos ex-President Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani's Fraud Case Goes to Jury</p>",
