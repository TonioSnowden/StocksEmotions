  "title": "Holmes Addresses Prosecutors' Contentions --- Theranos founder describes her self as well-intentioned and inexperienced",
  "text": "<p>Her testimony Tuesday, her third day on the witness stand, sought to pick apart what lawyers following the trial have deemed the prosecution's strongest evidence.</p><p>Ms. Holmes told the jury that she added the logos of major pharmaceutical companies to Theranos documents with honest intentions; that she didn't try to avert regulatory oversight but was transparent with the Food and Drug Administration and that Theranos turned to using commercial blood analyzers to deal with higher blood-sample volumes caused by a retail partner's decision, not because it was trying to mislead anyone about what its own devices could do.</p><p>While on the stand, Ms. Holmes looked intently at her lawyer and flashed an occasional smile. During breaks, she tightly embraced her partner, mother and friends who had come to support her.</p><p>Ms. Holmes faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each fraud count. The case appears to be heading toward a conclusion, as the defendant is traditionally the last witness to be called in criminal trials. Prosecutors will have the opportunity to cross-examine her and offer a rebuttal after the defense rests its case.</p><p>Ms. Holmes said Theranos started using commercial blood analyzers after it changed its business model to accommodate a request in 2012 from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which had a partnership with Theranos.</p><p>But Theranos continued to claim it could run more than 200 tests on a small amount of blood from a finger prick using its proprietary device. Evidence from the prosecution has shown that it could only run about a dozen tests on its own machines -- even those tests were unreliable -- and for the majority it relied on commercially available machines, altering them to be able to run tests on a small sample of blood, court records and testimony has shown.</p><p>In 2015, at a conference days after The Wall Street Journal first reported on Theranos's problems with its technology, Ms. Holmes insisted: \"We have never used commercially available lab equipment for finger-stick based tests.\"</p><p>In her court testimony, Ms. Holmes said that after Theranos and Walgreens struck an agreement to put Theranos devices in its drugstores to offer customers on-site blood tests, Walgreens changed its mind and asked Theranos to instead run the tests at its own lab. Eventually, blood samples flooded into Theranos, and the company was ill-prepared.</p><p>It became impractical to test hundreds of samples on its proprietary devices, Ms. Holmes said, since each machine could only run one sample at a time, so Theranos bought commercial analyzers and modified them to work with the small samples of blood it collected.</p><p>A spokesman for Walgreens declined to comment. A former Walgreens official involved in the partnership disputed Ms. Holmes's account in an interview Tuesday, saying the companies agreed to the new arrangement after Walgreens lawyers rejected the startup's theory that its devices could be used in drugstores without regulatory oversight.</p><p>Ms. Holmes said Theranos told the FDA about the change to lab-based testing but told no one else, including Walgreens, because it was a trade secret.</p><p>---</p><p>Sara Randazzo and Christopher Weaver contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
