  "title": "Theranos Former President Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani Found Guilty on All 12 Fraud Counts; Verdict comes six months after founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted for similar charges",
  "text": "<p>The verdict is the second conviction against Theranos leadership and comes six months after a jury found Ms. Holmes guilty of fraud, securing another major for the U.S. government, which brought the case against the pair in 2018. It brings to conclusion one of Silicon Valley's most notorious startup implosions, which saw nearly $1 billion of investor money evaporate after revelations that the company delivered inaccurate blood-test results to patients, including for life-threatening conditions, and Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani lied about its proprietary technology.</p><p>Mr. Balwani, Theranos's former president and chief operating officer, was charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His case, like Ms. Holmes's, marked a rare prosecution of a technology executive, and served as a referendum on startups taking the culture of \"fake it until you make it\" too far. Mr. Balwani faces up to 20 years in prison for each count for which he was found guilty, but former prosecutors said such a stiff sentence is rare in white-collar cases.</p><p>Mr. Balwani's verdict is a broad indictment of his and Ms. Holmes's efforts to deceive patients and investors about the company's blood-testing technology. It also shows how the government, in its second time prosecuting the case against the Theranos executives, appeared to have buttoned up its arguments following Ms. Holmes's trial, which had a more mixed result. Ms. Holmes was found guilty on four of the 11 charges against her and acquitted of four, and the jury couldn't reach a unanimous conclusion on three. Mr. Balwani didn't testify in his own defense, as Ms. Holmes did.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you surprised by the verdict in the Balwani trial? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Balwani's trial lacked the spectacle of Ms. Holmes's, when members of the press and public gathered hours before dawn outside the courthouse for one of the coveted seats, and Ms. Holmes filled courtroom benches with friends and family. Mr. Balwani's trial, which began in mid-March, on most days had minimal press coverage and only a smattering of attendees, including his brother. Yet lawyers who followed the case say Mr. Balwani's trial was no less importantâ€”he was one half of a power couple and accused of carrying out the same crimes.</p><p>\"I considered Mr. Balwani and Elizabeth to be unified in all of their decision-making processes,\" Mark Pandori, Theranos's lab director from 2013 to 2014, who reported to Mr. Balwani, said in his testimony in March.</p><p>Mr. Balwani was in charge of the company's lab, where the blood testing occurred, and was quick to rebuff and sometimes fire employees who raised concerns about the performance of Theranos technology, prosecutors and witnesses said. He was responsible for the financial models given to investors that greatly exaggerated revenue, prosecutors said, and he managed the company's partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., in which the startup would offer its finger-prick tests inside the drugstore chain. </p><p>Elizabeth Holmes leaving federal court in San Jose, Calif., after the verdict in her trial was delivered on Jan. 3.
