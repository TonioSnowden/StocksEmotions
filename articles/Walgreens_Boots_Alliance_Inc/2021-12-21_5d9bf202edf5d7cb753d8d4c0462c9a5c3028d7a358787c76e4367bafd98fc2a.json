  "title": "Business News:  Pandemic Stresses  Pharmacy Workers  ---  Some complain about  working long hours  and extra shifts, often  unable to take breaks  ----  By Sharon Terlep",
  "text": "<p>   America's pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, slammed by short staffing and demands of giving Covid vaccines and tests, are burning out as the world heads into another pandemic surge. </p><p>   Working conditions are deteriorating at big chain pharmacies such as CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp., which are central to the country's pandemic testing and vaccination efforts, according to dozens of employees, organizations representing pharmacists and experts in the field. </p><p>   CVS and Walgreens said they are working to improve conditions by adding prescheduled breaks, hiring staff and raising pay. Rite Aid said it would start closing its stores an hour early and allow walk-in vaccines for only one hour a day. Like many industries, retailers have been hit by labor shortages and burnout complaints from employees. </p><p>   Pharmacists and technicians say they are juggling too many tasks, working long hours and extra shifts, often unable to take breaks, and are subject to abuse from customers angry over long wait times and scheduling mistakes. Meanwhile, in parts of the country where cases are surging, drugstores aren't able to meet demand for Covid-19 testing and inoculations, according to customers and staffers. </p><p>   \"You don't get a break, ever. You're lucky if you can go to the bathroom,\" said Anne Regan, who in November quit her $14.50-an-hour job as a pharmacy technician at a Walgreens in Plymouth, Wis. </p><p>   A call on social media for a Monday \"sick out\" by pharmacists and technicians led the American Pharmacists Association, a professional group representing pharmacists, to press for better working conditions while discouraging workers from calling in sick. </p><p>   \"Workplace conditions have pushed many pharmacists and pharmacy teams to the brink of despair,\" the organization said in a statement. \"It is impacting patients today with delayed prescription fulfillment, unacceptable waits for vaccines and testing.\" </p><p>   The association also called for private insurance and government plans to reimburse pharmacists for clinical work, such as patient consultations or help managing medications, rather than have payments based strictly on services such as prescriptions filled or shots given. </p><p>   A CVS spokesman said the company is doing everything it can to support its pharmacy workers. The chain, with about 9,900 U.S. stores, said it has begun adding prescheduled break time and is hiring thousands of pharmacy staff. The spokesman declined to say if the company is hiring more workers than it's losing. Thousands of CVS stores operate separate vaccine clinics in which pharmacists and other workers focus only on administering shots, the company said. In stores without clinics, the company said, it is changing practices to improve predictability and structure for pharmacy staff. </p><p>   A Walgreens spokesman said the company, with 9,000 U.S. stores, has taken steps to reduce workloads and is spending more to bulk up staffing to free up pharmacists to focus on clinical duties. </p><p>   \"We're working diligently at all levels to make sure these concerns are addressed,\" the spokesman said. Walgreens also said it is building in break times to ensure pharmacy staff get down time during the day. </p><p>   Both chains have started raising their minimum hourly wage, with plans to reach $15 an hour by mid- to late next year. </p><p>   Rite Aid, with about 2,500 U.S. stores, said Sunday it will implement overnight teams to handle tasks not directly related to dealing with customers as well as close all stores an hour early Monday through Friday \"to help alleviate stress immediately.\" </p><p>   This summer, pharmacist Bled Tanoe quit her job at an Oklahoma City Walgreens because of working conditions. Ms. Tanoe started a social-media campaign to lobby for better working conditions called GBP pizzaisnotworking. It refers to free pizzas offered as morale boosters to pharmacy staff. </p><p>   \"Our profession was not supposed to feel this way,\" said Ms. Tanoe, who is now working at a hospital. </p><p></p>",
