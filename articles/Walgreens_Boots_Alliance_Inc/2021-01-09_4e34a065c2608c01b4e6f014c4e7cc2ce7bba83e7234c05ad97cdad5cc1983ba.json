  "text": "<p>   Federal and state officials are tapping regional and supermarket-based pharmacies to help speed up administration of Covid-19 vaccines amid a slower-than-planned rollout. </p><p>   Rite Aid Corp., Kroger Co., Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket LLC and other retailers are being asked to provide inoculations to front-line workers and other vulnerable people. While the timeline is weeks earlier than planned, companies say they hope to test and troubleshoot protocols before distributing vaccines to the masses. </p><p>   \"We're getting calls just because of the need,\" said Colleen Lindholz, president of Kroger's health-care business. Officials from South Carolina and Georgia reached out to Kroger this week, and the company has been providing shots to health-care professionals in its stores and sending staff to long-term facilities in Alaska, West Virginia, Texas and Arkansas. </p><p>   The executives of Kroger and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., two of the biggest retailers involved in the vaccine effort, expressed frustration over what they said was a slower-than-necessary rollout because of holdups at the state and federal levels. </p><p>   Kroger is also exploring ways to hold large events in community centers and stadiums that would allow it to vaccinate 600 to 800 people at a time, Ms. Lindholz said. </p><p>   More than 17 million doses of vaccines from Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership have been shipped, and roughly 5.3 million had been administered as of Thursday morning, according to federal figures. </p><p>   Part of the shortfall is because of a lag in reporting data. But the rollout also is encountering speed bumps, from confusion at the state level around how doses get distributed to hesitancy on the part of people who qualify for the vaccine in this first round. </p><p>   The U.S. is in the first stage of a vaccine administration plan that starts with health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens, the nation's largest drugstore chains, are leading the efforts to vaccinate staff and residents at roughly 50,000 long-term-care facilities. </p><p>   Many retailers were expected to start immunizing people during the next phase and had been preparing by hiring pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, securing medical gear and adding scheduling services. Offering vaccinations has been a way for retailers to bring in more customers. </p><p>   But health officials are seeking their help earlier than planned as the initial rollout lags behind the federal government's goal. </p><p></p>",
