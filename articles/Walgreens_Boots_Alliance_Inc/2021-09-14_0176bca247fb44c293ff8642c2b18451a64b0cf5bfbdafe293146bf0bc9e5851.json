  "title": "Prosecution Witnesses in Theranos Trial to Support Claim Elizabeth Holmes Lied; The initial testimony against the blood-testing startup founder is likely to go to the heart of the government's fraud case",
  "text": "<p>Federal prosecutors are set to continue questioning witnesses in a San Jose, Calif., court on Tuesday, after the trial kicked off with opening statements Wednesday but was then paused after a juror said he potentially had exposure to Covid-19. This first batch of witnesses have previously, in media appearances or separate court cases tied to Theranos, made statements that back up the government's key arguments: that Theranos's secretive culture fostered deception and coverups, that the company misled investors about its finances and that it skirted federal regulations.</p><p>Ms. Holmes faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a white-collar criminal case that has captivated Silicon Valley and been the fodder for a book, movies and podcasts. She has pleaded not guilty. The trial is expected to last more than three months.</p><p>The defunct blood-testing startup's controller, Danise Yam, whose legal name is So Han Spivey, is slated to continue testimony that began last week about the company's erratic financial controls.</p><p>Court filings show that two other important witnesses will likely testify soon after Ms. Yam: Erika Cheung, a former Theranos lab worker who alerted federal regulators to problems at the company, and Daniel Edlin, a onetime project manager who reported directly to Ms. Holmes and could testify about technology claims Theranos made to the Defense Department and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.</p><p>Ms. Cheung declined to comment. Mr. Edlin and Ms. Yam didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In his opening statement, Robert Leach, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury Ms. Holmes deliberately lied to investors, business partners and patients to keep money coming in the door. Ms. Holmes's attorney portrayed her as a dedicated entrepreneur who may have been a bit naive but whose only crime was that her startup failed, as many startups do.</p><p>The Journal's investigative reporting in 2015 and 2016 exposed how Theranos's technology didn't work, how the blood-testing company tried to cover up its failures and how patients' lives were affected and their health jeopardized.</p><p>Ms. Yam managed finances at Theranos for 11 years. During that time, the company suffered losses of tens of millions of dollars, prosecutors say, even as it was telling investors it was having great success with its lab testing devices that Theranos said could diagnose more than 200 conditions with a few drops of blood from a finger prick.</p><p>In her testimony Wednesday, Ms. Yam said that her job for a period of time included picking and choosing which vendors to pay and moving money around to make sure employee paychecks cleared since the company didn't have meaningful sources of revenue. She also testified that Theranos had gone about seven years without a completed financial audit and discussed the company's financial duress. A detailed chart displayed in court showed the company had net losses of $11.5 million in 2009, $16.2 million in 2010 and $27.5 million in 2011.</p><p>In a previous deposition, taken for a civil lawsuit brought by Theranos investors that settled for an undisclosed sum, Ms. Yam discussed how Theranos booked revenue of $150,000 in 2014, yet that same year Ms. Holmes and her top deputy approached investors with projections of bringing in $113 million in revenue in 2015. Theranos never made a profit, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation interview with Ms. Yam included in court records.</p><p>Ms. Cheung, who has appeared in a documentary and TED talk about Theranos, alerted the main U.S. lab regulator to what she alleged were persistent safety and quality-standard violations in Theranos's lab. In 2015, Ms. Cheung wrote a nearly 1,800-word letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services alleging that Theranos ignored standards for staff credentials, frequently used expired lab supplies and that its proprietary testing devices had \"major stability, precision and accuracy problems.\"</p><p>In an inspection report completed after Ms. Cheung's complaints, CMS described similar findings. Theranos later voided all of the results from tests done on its machines, and reached a settlement with CMS under which Theranos voluntarily closed its labs.</p><p>Mr. Edlin was a college friend of Ms. Holmes's brother, Christian Holmes, who was also employed at Theranos. Mr. Edlin was in charge of managing Theranos's relationships with the Defense Department and Walgreens as well as pharmaceutical companies, according to court records filed by prosecutors.</p><p>In an earlier deposition in the investor lawsuit, Mr. Edlin described how Ms. Holmes had staged a demonstration of its technology for Walgreens executives. Yet after drawing blood from at least four or five Walgreens officials, Theranos didn't test their blood on the Theranos devices that had been brought in for the demonstration, Mr. Edlin said. They packed up the samples and brought them to Theranos's laboratory to test on different devices, Mr. Edlin said.</p><p>Despite his high-ranking position and regular communication with Ms. Holmes, Mr. Edlin said in the deposition he was often in the dark about what the company was doing and didn't learn until 2016 that the company was using third-party devices for many tests, years after that practice started.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com and Christopher Weaver at Christopher.Weaver@wsj.com</p><p>Prosecution Witnesses in Theranos Trial to Support Claim Elizabeth Holmes Lied</p>",
