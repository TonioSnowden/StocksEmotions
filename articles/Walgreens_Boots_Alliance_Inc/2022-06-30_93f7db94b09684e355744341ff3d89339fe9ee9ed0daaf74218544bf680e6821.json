  "text": "<p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s quarterly sales fell and earnings plunged as revenue from Covid-19 vaccinations dried up and the pharmacy chain paid out an opioid settlement.</p><p>The Deerfield, Ill., drugstore chain has relied on demand for Covid-19 tests and vaccines to power sales over the past year. Demand dropped off significantly in its fiscal third quarter, as Walgreens administered 4.7 million vaccinations, down from 11.8 million in the Omicron-driven prior quarter, the company said Thursday.</p><p>Overall sales fell about 2% to $32.6 billion, largely on declining pharmacy sales. Retail sales rose slightly, helped by higher sales of at-home Covid tests.</p><p>The company reached a $683 million deal last month to resolve claims related to the distribution of prescription opioid medications in Florida.</p><p>For the period ended May 31, Walgreens posted a profit of $289 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.38 a share, last year.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, Walgreens said adjusted earnings were 96 cents a share, 4 cents higher than analysts had expected, according to FactSet.</p><p>The company said investments in the growth of its Walgreens Health business also chipped away at its bottom line. Walgreens has been looking to expand into the healthcare industry, having acquired a major position last year in home-health benefits manager CareCentrix and primary-care network VillageMD.</p><p>Walgreens, which backed its outlook for the year, earlier this week said that it would keep its Boots U.K. pharmacy chain and No7 Beauty Co. business after failing to receive adequate bids for the units. The company said market conditions had put a severe crimp on financing availability for potential buyers and it will instead focus on growing both businesses.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Walgreens Profit Shrinks After Opioid Deal, Fewer Vaccinations</p>",
