  "title": "Kohl's Ends Talks Over Its Sale to Vitamin Shoppe Owner Franchise Group; Department-store chain had been in exclusive talks to be bought for $8 billion, but it said rising interest rates and an uncertain retail environment made a deal imprudent",
  "text": "<p>The retailer's chairman, Peter Boneparth, said Friday that recent choppiness in the financing market and the retail industry had made a deal unattainable.</p><p>\"Given the environment and market volatility, the board determined that it simply was not prudent to continue pursuing a deal,\" he said.</p><p>Kohl's last month entered exclusive talks to sell itself to Franchise Group, which owns retail brands like Vitamin Shoppe, after a sales process that attracted other bidders.</p><p>Kohl's share fell more than 15% in premarket trading. CNBC earlier reported on the deal falling apart.</p><p>Kohl's attracted interest from more than 25 bidders, including the private-equity firm Sycamore Partners and Canada's Hudson's Bay, owner of Saks, during a monthslong sales process. Franchise Group initially offered to pay $60 a share for Kohl's but ultimately reduced the price to $53 a share, though without definitive financing to close the deal.</p><p>Kohl's said Friday that the two sides \"faced significant obstacles reaching a fully executable agreement.\"</p><p>Inflation is driving interest rates higher and raising the cost of capital, slowing deal making from its record-setting pace last year.</p><p>Kohl's has also been facing a downturn in discretionary spending that has hit the retail industry particularly hard, with climbing inflation pushing consumers to prioritize their shopping needs. On Friday, Kohl's said that inflation is cutting further into consumer spending and that it expects sales to fall at a high-single-digit rate in its second quarter, worse than prior expectations of a low-single-digit drop.</p><p>Kohl's is the latest retailer to call off sales plans due to the current financing environment. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. recently said it would keep its Boots and No7 Beauty Co. business after failing to receive adequate bids for its U.K. pharmacy chain.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Kohl's Ends Talks Over Its Sale to Vitamin Shoppe Owner Franchise Group</p>",
