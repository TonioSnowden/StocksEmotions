  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Ex-Theranos Chemist Says CEO Knew of Test Issues",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Gangakhedkar resigned in September 2013, on the eve of Theranos's rollout with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in which Theranos put its testing devices in dozens of the retailer's drugstores.</p><p>She said the launch was premature, given the number of errors that plagued Theranos's devices, which after two years hadn't shown much improvement. She said that although she flagged the problems many times, the company forged ahead with plans to test patients, according to her testimony.</p><p>Ms. Gangakhedkar said she kept some Theranos documents when she left the company to protect herself.</p><p>\"I was scared that things would not go well,\" said Ms. Gangakhedkar, her voice breaking at one point. \"I was afraid I would be blamed.\"</p><p>Ms. Gangakhedkar, who reported directly to Ms. Holmes, testified after being granted immunity by the federal judge overseeing the case, Edward Davila.</p><p>Walgreens ended the relationship in 2016, after Theranos voided years of test results performed on its machines.</p><p>Ms. Holmes, the chief executive, was aware of these issues, too, said Ms. Gangakhedkar, and yet pressured staff to make the Walgreens rollout happen. Employees had to rush the validation process of the lab tests, she said.</p><p>Ms. Holmes faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Attorneys for Ms. Holmes have said the entrepreneur dedicated 15 years to her work and her only crime was having a startup that failed, as so many startups do. Earlier in trial Friday, Ms. Holmes's attorneys sought to make the case that Theranos's lab had established quality-control systems, including an emergency email group to quickly address lab problems and regular quality-control tests on the devices, the results of which were shared with employees.</p><p>Government prosecutors presented a series of emails Friday from 2013, in which Ms. Gangakhedkar expressed concerns about persistent problems with Theranos's lab tests. Ms. Holmes was included on some of the emails.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
