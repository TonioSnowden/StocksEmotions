  "title": "When CEOs Zoom for Democrats",
  "text": "<p>As in Davos, the air in CEO Zoomland seems dizzyingly thin, triggering a giddy euphoria most company leaders don't bring to meetings about spending their own firm's money. How else to explain the political obliviousness of this event?</p><p>However high-minded their intent, these CEOs are bolting their company's interests to the professionals running the Democratic Party, whose No. 1 project is enacting a federal election law that advantages Democratic voting strategies such as ballot harvesting. That's \"democracy\"?</p><p>More astonishing, these CEOs are acting as though a strong Democratic majority will extend to the horizon of national politics. In fact, Democrats control half of the U.S. Senate and have a six-seat majority in the House. In 2020, Republican congressional candidates ran ahead of Donald Trump in New York and California. Odds are that Nancy Pelosi won't be speaker after next year's midterm elections. When that happens, one way or another, there will be retribution for this Zoom meeting.</p><p>For many of the CEO Zoomers, the meeting was simply a political coming-out party. This group is a self-selecting subsample of America's business leadership. A lot support the Democratic Party financially and will go wherever it asks them to go.</p><p>According to the Journal's report on the meeting, \"some executives on the call described some bills as either racist or restrictive.\" But what really matters to Democrats whose lifetime compensation depends on winning is that in the 2020 election, between 12% and 18% of black men voted for the Republican presidential candidate, in large part because of economic gains -- jobs and wages -- from 2016 through 2019.</p><p>Democrats can't afford additional voluntary black-voter swings toward Republicans in closely contested states such as North Carolina, Florida and Ohio. For professional Democrats, the details of the voting legislation in a state like Georgia are a second-order concern. More important is creating a dramatic public narrative aligning the party with black voters while making Republicans look anathema. The Zoom CEOs played their assigned partisan roles beautifully, though even in an era of compulsive virtue-signaling, one hates to see virtue reduced to political PR.</p><p>None of this is to suggest that the attendees at the Zoom Davos are hopeless political naifs. One doesn't rise to the corporate mountaintop without an eye on the bottom line. Some of the CEOs are betting on the Democrats propping up their businesses with the multiple subsidies and tax credits embedded in Joe Biden's spending on green energy, infrastructure, healthcare and technology.</p><p>As always, new public subsidies imply new taxes, which, as always, CEOs can afford -- or afford to pay someone to minimize. But their line managers and employees will pay. Someone has to.</p><p>In a way, these smug Zoom CEOs remind me of what were called \"country club Republicans\" in the 1950s. But in a world with woke employees' eyes on you 24/7, you can't get away with riding out Covid at a country home. So some of them are ostentatiously threatening to withhold investments from disfavored Republican states.</p><p>All this has caused some conservatives to decide to tee up \"corporations\" as the enemy of a post-Trump populist movement they imagine can be built around \"working-class Americans.\" This is a mistake and misjudgment.</p><p>Conservatives or Republican politicians attacking \"corporate America\" are rhetorically provocative but must confuse many average people hearing it -- who themselves are corporate America.</p><p>Google, Facebook and Twitter may be woke compost heaps from the executive office down through entry-level interns, but corporate America isn't Santa Clara County.</p><p>Across the U.S., legal entities called corporations employ millions of Americans -- most of them middle class, most raising families, and many living in battleground states and suburbs that Republicans must carry to win elections.</p><p>Coca-Cola has more than 86,000 employees, many living in up-for-grabs Georgia, but what are they supposed to think when conservatives attack \"Coca-Cola,\" though in fact their (deserved) target is one person -- CEO James Quincey?</p><p>By all means, call out these CEOs by name. But it makes no sense for Republicans to cancel millions of Americans as \"the corporate class,\" a phrase with virtually no real meaning outside an AOC tweet.</p><p>The problem isn't the American corporation. The problem is a small but influential and unbearably sanctimonious swath of leaders who've gone ga-ga over progressive politics.</p><p>---</p><p>Write henninger@wsj.com.</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: CEOs, Woke or Not, Must Deal With Politics\" -- WSJ May 28, 2021)</p>",
