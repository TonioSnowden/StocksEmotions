  "text": "<p>\"It's an extension of the company's brand,\" says Don Bennyhoff, chief investment officer at Liberty Wealth Advisors, an investment firm.</p><p>Bennyhoff likens a ticker to a logo or even the signature colors a company uses for its products (he cites the distinctive shade of red on a can of Coca-Cola KO). Still, Bennyhoff doubts that serious investors would buy a stock based on the ticker.</p><p>But maybe they should? In one study from Pomona College, researchers found that a portfolio of \"clever ticker\" companies \"would have beaten the market by a substantial and statistically significant margin\" between 2006 and 2018.</p><p>So, what are some companies and funds with the most distinctive tickers? Consider these 10 examples.</p><p>Molson Coors: You've probably had this company's namesake beers — perhaps via the TAP at your local watering hole.</p><p>Harley-Davidson: Yes, this company is known to make a cool motorcycle. But true fans refer to the two-wheeled vehicle as a HOG.</p><p>Dave &amp; Buster's: Some may come to this chain's locations to dine. But more likely, they are there to PLAY the arcade games.</p><p>Cheesecake Factory: As its name implies, this restaurant chain serves plenty of CAKE — cheesecake for sure, but we're also partial to its Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.</p><p>Canopy Growth Corporation: Got WEED? This Canadian cannabis company certainly does (to be specific, CA:WEED is its symbol on the Toronto exchange, but on the U.S. Nasdaq symbol, it's listed as CGC).</p><p>Cambria Cannabis ETF: If you're into weed and weed investing, you can take a TOKE and buy this marijuana fund.</p><p>Petco Health and Wellness: If you hear a big WOOF from your dog, he's probably telling you to head to this chain for some pet treats.</p><p>Turtle Beach: This company makes headsets for the gamer crowd, so they can HEAR all the action.</p><p>Brinker International: Did you ever EAT at Chili's or Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants? They're both part of the Brinker portfolio.</p><p>These companies win the prize for the most clever ticker symbols</p>",
