  "title": "America's Love Affair With Iced Drinks; In the 19th century, American ingenuity vanquished the traditional belief that it was unhealthy to add ice to beverages.",
  "text": "<p>When the first known recipe for the cocktail was published in 1833, it called for water as an ingredient. But by the time the landmark book \"The Bar-Tender's Guide\"—also known as \"How to Mix Drinks, or the Bon- Vivant's Companion\"—came out in 1862, the recipe specified ice. In 1869, the American cocktail guide \"Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks\" promised that \"the author has given especial attention to the subject of Refrigeration—almost a new art among us—as well as to that of aerated waters, and other draughts so much sought after in the summer season.\" This gives a fairly narrow time range in which ice came into common use in American drinks, overcoming a prejudice that dated back to ancient times.</p><p>Where it was available, ice had been employed medicinally for centuries, as an anti-inflammatory against swelling in wounds and broken bones; to reduce muscle spasms, cramping and pain from injuries and arthritis; to reduce the pain of sores and lesions externally; and to reduce fevers both internally and externally. Iced beverages had been a historical hit or miss. But adding ice or snow directly to wine or water was thought by different cultures to cause colic, convulsions, paralysis, blindness, madness and sudden death. In Roman times, some people mixed their wine with snow rather than water, but Pliny protested that cold drinks with ice added were unnatural, as it went against the seasons.</p><p>Before the invention of modern refrigeration, ice to cool food was collected in the wintertime from lakes and mountaintops and stored in caves, underground cellars and insulated icehouses to last as long as possible through the summers. Wealthy people in Europe built icehouses as part of their estates. But often when beverages were chilled, the ice was used on the outside of the vessel rather than in direct contact with the liquid. In the 1600s in Spain and Italy, glass vessels were made with pockets for filling with snow or ice to chill without mixing. A Polish poem set in 1811 tells of vodka cooling in snowdrifts to be served after a hunt.</p><p>In early American soda fountains, ice was often used to cool the tanks for soda water rather than put into the drinks themselves. The \"Standard Manual of Soda and Other Beverages\" from 1906 states, \"Some dealers put shaved ice into the soda water when served. It is a tedious process to grind the ice on a shaver, and makes the process of serving drinks much slower; ice is usually impure, and the beverage is really not fit to drink; and lastly, the beverage quickly loses its gas and tastes flat.\" Early drawings show people sipping Coca-Cola from small, U-shaped glasses that fit into the hand, rather than the ice-filled Big Gulp familiar today.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your favorite iced summer drink? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Credit for making ice an ingredient inside beverages in America goes to Bostonian Frederic Tudor. Beginning in the 1810s, his workers cut up frozen lakes, including Walden Pond (Henry David Thoreau described the ice harvest in \"Walden\" in 1854), and shipped it off to ports both foreign (including Martinique, Cuba, India and Brazil) and domestic (Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans and others). A Boston newspaper in 1806 wrote, \"No joke. A vessel has cleared at the Custom House for Martinique with a cargo of ice. We hope this will not prove a slippery speculation.\"</p><p>Tudor sold ice for medicinal use to doctors in the tropics, but the real profits came from its use for food and drink. He offered bartenders free ice to get their customers hooked on cooling drinks. \"It is a matter of certainty that the love of cold drinks and refreshments in warm weather is nearly universal and that the prejudice against them wears away more and more every year,\" Tudor wrote. \"A man who has drank his drinks cold at the same expense for one week can never be presented with them warm again.\" He was right: Tudor's big bet eventually paid off, though he lost all his money a few times along the way.</p><p>Ice become a signature ingredient in American beverages. Englishwoman Sarah Mytton Maury toured the U.S. in the 1840s and wrote effusively about the use of ice: \"Of all the luxuries in America I most enjoyed the ice…It is customary when you pay a visit, for the attendant immediately on your arrival to present you with ice water or iced lemonade.\"</p><p>When ice came to England, it was imported from the U.S. The Wenham Lake Ice Company in Massachusetts marketed its product as the best and purest. Its deliverymen wore uniforms with American eagles on the buttons, reflecting its provenance. In 1845, the newspaper Wilmer and Smith's European Times reported: \"This commodity which was first introduced to the notice of the English public a short time ago…is so rapidly advancing in popularity in the metropolis that no banquet of any magnitude is considered complete without it…Not only is the Wenham Lake ice coming into vogue as a luxury among the aristocracy, but it is also recommending itself to the middle classes as a necessity, and even to the humbler ranks of life as an article of economy.\"</p><p>In the U.S., the new availability of ice resulted in the creation of new categories of alcoholic drinks, including cobblers and juleps, and the idea of \"cooling drinks\" in general. The cobbler, including the sherry cobbler, took hold in the mid-1800s; it is essentially a sherry sour over cobblestone-size ice. Maury recalled a dinner party conversation on her visit to the U.S.: \"'Whenever you hear America abused,' observed a lady to me as she presented a glass of sparkling sherry cobbler, with the huge crystals floating about in the exquisitely co-mingled cup, 'remember the ice.'\"</p><p>This essay is adapted from Mr. English's new book, \"Doctors and Distillers: The Remarkable Medicinal History of Beer, Wine, Spirits and Cocktails,\" which will be published July 19 by Penguin Press.</p><p>America's Love Affair With Iced Drinks</p>",
