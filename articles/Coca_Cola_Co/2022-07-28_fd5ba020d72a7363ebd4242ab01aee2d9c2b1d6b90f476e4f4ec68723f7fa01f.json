  "title": "Sprite Goes Green by Ditching Its Green Bottle; Coca-Cola Co. said that starting next week it would instead use more sustainable clear bottles",
  "text": "<p>The company said Wednesday that it is easier to reuse clear plastic than green plastic for new bottles. Sprite's green plastic is recyclable, but green plastic is more often converted into single-use items such as carpets and clothing.</p><p>Coke officials have said that Sprite's green color and packaging were meant to communicate that the drink tasted refreshing. The lemon-lime drink and its packaging have been green ever since Sprite launched in the U.S. in 1961. The drink has been one of Coke's bestselling products, according to the company.</p><p>Coke said the move to clear plastic would help support what it called a circular economy for plastic packaging.</p><p>Sprite's cans and packaging graphics will still be green, the company said, but the Sprite logo was set to change.</p><p>Omar Farha, a chemistry professor at Northwestern University, said that the new Sprite bottles would be good for the environment because it is easier to reuse plastic that isn't colored with dyes.</p><p>\"Any time you simplify what's in the plastics or in the plastic bottle in general, you just enhance the chance of that bottle being recycled and reused,\" he said.</p><p>Coke said that the other green bottles it sells in North America—including those for Seagram's ginger ale; Mello Yello, a citrus soda; and Fresca, a citrus sparkling water—would also be sold in clear plastic bottles in the coming months.</p><p>The company added that most of its Dasani water bottles would soon be made of recycled plastic.</p><p>Alessandra Leri, a chemistry professor at Marymount Manhattan College, said it is possible Coke was changing Sprite and Dasani's packaging to create a greater supply of recycled plastic that it could reuse in its products.</p><p>Only 5% of plastic waste in the U.S. is recycled, according to a recent Energy Department report. Experts say the recycling rate is low in part because there is little demand for recycled plastic and because China in 2018 stopped buying large amounts of plastic waste from the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Sprite Goes Green by Ditching Its Green Bottle</p>",
