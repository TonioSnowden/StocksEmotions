  "text": "<p>\n  Tunnel 29 </p><p>\n  By Helena Merriman </p><p>\n  (PublicAffairs, 318 pages, $28) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  When Joachim Rudolph and his family left their farm in eastern Germany in February 1945, young Joachim had no way of knowing they were on the run, or that escape would become a defining theme of his life. As Helena Merriman recounts in \"Tunnel 29: The True Story of an Extraordinary Escape Beneath the Berlin Wall,\" what Joachim's father couldn't tell him, \"because how do you tell a six-year-old any of this,\" was that they were fleeing \"from the Red Army. He'd heard about them last night on the radio, the Russian soldiers coming from the East, raping women and torching farms,\" and he was desperate to get his family to Berlin before the Russians found them. </p><p>\n  The Russians, however, were \"only a day's ride behind,\" and as they overtook the Rudolph family and \"millions of refugees like them,\" the troops only stopped long enough to rape the women and take away the men -- among them Joachim's father, who will die in the Gulag. Stunned at how quickly their idyllic farm life had become a war-torn nightmare, Joachim, his mother and sister retreat back to their village, which they find already occupied by slightly kinder Russian officers. </p><p>\n  The family eventually make another attempt for Berlin, embarking on an arduous five-month trek during a scorching summer. By the time they finally stumble into the bombed-out city, in November 1945, the Nazis have already surrendered and Berlin has been divided among the Allies. The Rudolphs gradually carve out a meager existence for themselves in Soviet-controlled East Germany. For Joachim, one of the few bright spots amid the bleak postwar landscape is his discovery of his love -- and talent -- for science and engineering. </p><p>\n  On weekends he and his friends travel to the Ku'damm shopping district in West Berlin, \"where they buy Coca-Cola and sweets from Woolworths, watch glamorous women in sheer stockings and moleskin fur coats wander in and out of jewellery shops, and lust after the gadgets in department store windows.\" The marked difference between the two Berlins is not lost on Joachim and others: In East Germany, the communist paradise never quite materializes. There is free education and subsidized housing, but basic goods are in such short supply that when they do appear, Sozialistische Wartegemeinschaften -- \"socialist waiting communities,\" or informal networks of friends and family -- immediately call one another to spread the news and race to the shops, joining queues that snake down the street. West Berlin at the time, Ms. Merriman reminds us, is \"the most American city outside America,\" and all East Berliners have to do to get a taste of mini-America is \"hop over the border.\" Some never come back. </p><p>\n  That ends on Aug. 13, 1961, when rolls of concertina wire are placed along the border between East and West Germany. Joachim and his friends are out camping at the time; when they hear the announcement on the public loudspeakers, they immediately race back home. \"They reach Bernauer Strasse, the mile-long road that straddles the border,\" Ms. Merriman tell us. \"Climbing out of the car, Joachim and his friends walk towards a sign, a sign they've passed hundreds of times crossing the border from East to West Berlin: YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE DEMOCRATIC SECTOR OF BERLIN. . . . Usually there'd be a couple of policemen standing by that sign, but now, silhouetted in the glare of a single street-lamp, Joachim sees a group of men in green uniforms and steel helmets. But it's not their uniforms that scares him. It's what they're holding across their chests: machine-guns.\" Joachim is trapped. </p><p>\n  What follows is a riveting story that Ms. Merriman, a former BBC reporter, first told in a BBC Radio 4 podcast. Joachim eventually builds a tunnel underneath Bernauer Strasse and across one of the most well-guarded borders in the world. He wants to help people escape from a walled-offsociety full of fear, intimidation and perhaps the most efficient secret police ever, whose well-kept files provided Ms. Merriman with a trove of details -- on Joachim, his contacts, his enemies, and the mock trials and harrowing prisons that awaited anyone who tried to escape. What makes this story all the more amazing, however, is that, during the early days of the wall, Joachim had already escaped to West Berlin by crawling across a country field. The tunnel he builds originates in the West, bringing him back to the East. </p><p>\n  The tunnel itself is not without its challenges, most of which are figured out by Joachim and a few fellow engineering students. Also part of this group are a number of West Germans who can still take day trips across the border -- they act as couriers, spies and lookouts. </p><p>\n  Once Joachim and his cohorts determine the path of the tunnel, they need to pinpoint the East Berlin basement where they will break through. The digging is long, tiring work and each obstacle -- lighting, ventilation, shoring -- has to be overcome without alerting the ever-vigilant East German border guards. </p><p>\n  Joachim's first attempt ends in failure when the tunnel floods -- probably from a broken water main on the East German side. Then he hears of another similar tunnel that has been abandoned. He and his team take it over and soon complete it. But that only creates another harrowing logistical nightmare, as the escapees must now be alerted to the address of the new tunnel entrance. </p><p>\n  Miraculously, it all comes together. On Sept. 14, 1962, thanks to Joachim and his compatriots, 29 East Berliners crawl 400 feet to freedom. As the last one descends into the tunnel, Joachim contemplates what he's accomplished. </p><p>\n  \"As he looks at the tunnel, the sides beginning to fall in, Joachim's mind races, snapshot-memories of the last four months appearing in his head like frames on a film-reel. The leaks. The electric shocks. The mud, so much mud. The blisters. The Stasi soldier under the window. The people who came tonight. Knowing they're all safe in West Berlin, he feels the most intense happiness that he's ever experienced. More exquisite than his own escape.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Yost writes about military history for the Journal. </p><p></p>",
