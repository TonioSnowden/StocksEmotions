  "text": "<p>The White House has a long and colourful history of mixing politics with booze. Franklin D Roosevelt attempted to smooth US-Soviet relations by stirring a Martini for Stalin. George Washington curried favour with voters on polling day by handing out free punch and rum. John F Kennedy chose a Daiquiri to toast his victory over Nixon. In recent times it has been a more temperate place – both Trump and Biden are teetotal. Some commentators have blamed the demise of tipsy, cross-aisle socialising for the emergence of a more bitter partisan politics. The return of the White House Correspondents' Dinner (an event boycotted by Trump) was hailed as a return to a more convivial kind of politics. So where do the movers and shakers of DC go for a drink?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hayadams.com/dining/off-the-record\">Off The Record</a>, beneath the grand old Hay-Adams Hotel, has long been a favourite of DC's elite. Caricatures of political personalities populate its scarlet walls and beer mats: Kamala Harris, Anthony Fauci and Boris Johnson were flavour of the month when I visited recently. The circular <a href=\"https://washington.intercontinental.com/food-drink/round-robin-bar/\">Round Robin</a> bar at the Willard InterContinental has watered everyone from Mark Twain to Abraham Lincoln. Today the clientele, I suspect, is busier planning its sightseeing than political plotting – but head bartender Jim Hewes (who has served presidents including Reagan, both Bushes and Gerald Ford) still rolls out a presidential cocktail menu for inaugurations.&#xa0;</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.cafemilano.com/\">Cafe Milano</a> in Georgetown used to be the&#xa0;place where everyone went during the Trump administration,” says the <em>FT</em>'s US politics correspondent Courtney Weaver. “The French brasserie <a href=\"https://lediplomatedc.com/\">Le Diplomate</a> was big during the Obama years.” Pre-pandemic the downtown steakhouse <a href=\"https://www.bltrestaurants.com/location/blt-steak-washington-dc/\">BLT</a> “was&#xa0;always packed”, another DC insider tells&#xa0;me. “[<em>New York Times</em> chief Washington correspondent] Carl Hulse lived there, and I would see Kellyanne Conway and [CNN's] Wolf Blitzer there a lot.”</p> <p>These spots may be good for political rubbernecking, but you won't find much to excite on the drinks list. For agenda-setting cocktails head to <a href=\"https://www.silverlyan.com/\">Silver Lyan</a>; for a world-class whisky selection to <a href=\"http://jackrosediningsaloon.com/\">Jack Rose Dining Saloon</a>. One of DC's newest additions is <a href=\"https://www.fountaininndc.com/\">The Fountain Inn</a> in Georgetown. A stylish reimagining of an 18th-century tavern frequented by Washington and Jefferson, it serves contemporary takes on historical drinks including the Fish House Punch, made with&#xa0;peach brandy, cognac and rum.</p> <p>Rum with George Washington or Diet Coke with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>? I know which one gets my vote. &#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/alicelascelles\"><em>@alicelascelles</em></a></p><p>Source: Alice Lascelles 2022 'Where do Washington's politicians drink?'
