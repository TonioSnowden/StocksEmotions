  "title": "Teneo  CEO  Quits Over  Drunken  Conduct  ----  By Chip Cutter and Thomas Gryta",
  "text": "<p>   Declan Kelly resigned as chairman and chief executive of global consulting firm Teneo Holdings LLC after reports of drunken misbehavior at a charity event last month. </p><p>   Mr. Kelly, a go-to adviser for CEOs of major companies such as General Electric Co. and Coca-Cola Co., is handing over the CEO role to Teneo co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Paul Keary, Teneo said. It didn't name a new chairman. </p><p>   Mr. Kelly, 52 years old, apologized last week and said he would reduce his responsibilities after getting drunk and behaving inappropriately with people at an event hosted by the charity Global Citizen in early May. Mr. Kelly was drunk and touched women without their consent at the event, the Financial Times and others reported. </p><p>   Global Citizen, a charity that hosts fundraising concerts to address extreme poverty, removed Mr. Kelly from its board on May 3 and last week General Motors Co. dropped Teneo as an adviser after the details emerged. </p><p>   \"In order to protect the employees of Teneo and its clients, and with my family's strong support, I have decided to leave the company and resign as Chairman and CEO,\" Mr. Kelly said in a statement. </p><p>   Several Teneo executives and advisers had defended their boss in recent days even as some blue-chip clients debated whether to continue working with the influential firm, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Last week, Mr. Kelly told colleagues he would never drink again, said some of the people familiar with the matter. He continued to engage with clients and was expected to resume his full-time duties in September, these people said last week. </p><p>   Mr. Kelly said Tuesday that he took responsibility for his behavior on May 2 and apologized to people affected by it, including his colleagues and clients. </p><p>   \"A campaign against the reputation of our firm has followed and may even continue in the coming days,\" he said in his statement. \"However, regardless of the veracity of any such matters I do not want them to be an ongoing distraction to the running of our company.\" </p><p>   Formerly a newspaper reporter in Ireland, Mr. Kelly moved into public relations in the mid-1990s. He was an executive at public-relations firms and led a management buyout of one of them before making a move into U.S. politics. He was a top fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. </p><p>   In 2009, Mr. Kelly was appointed special envoy to Northern Ireland by Mrs. Clinton, who was then U.S. secretary of state. He co-founded Teneo in 2011 with former Clinton White House official Doug Band and Mr. Keary, a former consulting executive. Mr. Band, who retired from Teneo in December 2020, didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p></p>",
