  "text": "<p>Drake has listened and he has learned. Like Coca-Cola hurriedly reintroducing its old taste after tinkering with the formula in 1985 — the year before Aubrey Drake Graham was born — the Canadian rapper has executed a rapid U-turn. In June, he released his album <em>Honestly, Nevermind</em>, which took a surprise swerve towards house music. A backlash ensued among fans dismayed by the absence of rap beats. Four months later, one more than it took the mega-corp Coca-Cola to reverse course, the megastar has done the same.</p> <p><em>Her Loss</em> is a collaboration with Atlanta rapper 21 Savage. The pair teamed up on <em>Honestly, Nevermind</em>'s only straight-up rap number, “Jimmy Cooks”, which was by some distance that album's most successful song. Their 16 new tracks continue where it left off. It is unclear when they were made, whether before or after the sessions for <em>Honestly, Nevermind</em>, but they show signs of being recorded in a hurry. The beat in “BackOutsideBoyz” took only four minutes to create, according to one of its producers, Rio Leyva. It takes two and a half minutes to listen to, although its monotonous plod seems to drag on for much longer.</p> <p>Opening track “Rich Flex” switches between two much better beats, each one lithely soundtracking separate sections of rapping by the principals. Their voices dovetail well. Drake's needling style presses at us insistently, demanding our attention. Meanwhile, 21 Savage's measured Southern lilt conveys a menacing sense of self-control. A chart-topping solo artist in his own right, he plays the street rapper to Drake's rap god in the songs. He does a lot of gun talk — hard to process in the aftermath of the violent death of one of rap's big stars, Migos's Takeoff — while Drake brags about his super-luxe lifestyle. Both men behave with stereotypical rap machismo towards the women who lucklessly populate their verses.</p> <p>In “On BS”, Drake describes himself as a feminist because he spends “half a million on you hoes” while living it large in clubs. The absurd claim comes a few lines after he raps about taking drugs and getting muddled, so at least it has the benefit of a certain wit. Elsewhere, the stream of sexist denigration is just toxic. In “Circo Loco”, Drake seems to allude disrespectfully to a 2020 incident when rapper Megan Thee Stallion was wounded in an alleged shooting by her then partner, the singer Tory Lanez. There is a constant stream of brags and jokes from both him and 21 Savage about women having cosmetic procedures or performing sexual favours.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Middle of the Ocean” finds Drake hanging out in St Tropez, casting well-heeled scorn at “ignorant” fans who criticised the dance music direction of <em>Honestly, Nevermind</em>. His return to rap on <em>Her Loss</em> represents a more emollient response to them. But the beats suffer from inconsistency. “More M's” is atmospheric and icy; it was co-produced by 21 Savage's regular collaborator Metro Boomin. But the meandering to-and-fro of a crudely titled track featuring rapper Travis Scott sums up the autopilot mode that the album often slips into. The rehabilitation of Scott following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3929bed2-cc0b-42c0-b93c-6eb3c7b19c96\">crowd-crush deaths at his Astroworld festival</a> last year also sticks in the craw. <em>Her Loss</em> is not our gain.</p> <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p><em>‘Her Loss' is released on Republic Records/OVO Sound</em></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2022 'Drake U-turns back to rap in new album with 21 Savage ‘Her Loss' — review' FT.com 4 November.
