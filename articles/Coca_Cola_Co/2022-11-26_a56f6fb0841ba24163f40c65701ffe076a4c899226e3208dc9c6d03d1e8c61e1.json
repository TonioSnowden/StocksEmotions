  "text": "<p>   Regarding Mark Weinstein's \"Elon Musk Can Save Twitter -- and Democracy\" (op-ed, Nov. 21): In 1926 the president of Coca-Cola believed his sales force was lethargic. He called a meeting of his salesmen and fired them all. He then created a customer-service department whose goal was to help his customers make a profit on sales of his product. He encouraged the fired salesmen to apply for employment if they were willing to do the new job. Overnight, he changed the culture of his company. </p><p>   Mr. Musk is also trying to change a culture, getting workers to buy in to his thinking. If he fails, he will have lost $44 billion. I don't believe he plans on that outcome. The pundits should quit criticizing and give him a chance to see if his plan works. Businesses and government can monitor his actions and copy those elements that work to improve productivity. </p><p>   E.W. Hoelscher </p><p>   LaGrange, Ky. </p><p></p>",
