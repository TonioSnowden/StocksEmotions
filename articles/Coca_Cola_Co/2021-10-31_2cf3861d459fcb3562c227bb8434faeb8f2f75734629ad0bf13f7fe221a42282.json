Mr. Bryant invested roughly $10 million in several rounds and had served on the BodyArmor board before he died in 2020, the person said.</p><p>Gatorade still dominates the sports drink market, though BodyArmor sales have been climbing quickly. BodyArmor expects to generate about $1.4 billion in retail sales this year, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.
