  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Coca-Cola shares should be like a shaken bottle, ready to burst with effervescence later this year as economies around the world reopen. But now, new uncertainties from a tax controversy threaten to keep the stock on ice. </p><p>\n  While at-home sales have remained strong, out-of-home sales in places such as restaurants, bars and sports venues slid. As a result, Coca-Cola has been hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than rival PepsiCo, which has a huge snack business suited to the stay-at-home economy. Over the past year, Coca-Cola shares are down around 16%, compared with a 6% fall for Pepsi. </p><p>\n  The company reported Wednesday that organic sales fell 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates, according to Visible Alpha. That was an improvement from the 26% and 6% slides in the second and third quarters, respectively. Recent performance, however, has been worse than the headline quarterly figures suggest: On a conference call, the company said that sales weakened as the quarter went on and new restrictions came into place due to Covid-19 outbreaks. </p><p>\n  Still, Coca-Cola's sales look primed for a rebound as vaccinations continue and economies reopen. It was especially encouraging that, having previously declined to give guidance while citing \"known unknowns\" around the pandemic, the company is comfortable enough to guide for organic sales growth in the high single digits in 2021. Thanks in part to cost-cutting measures, profit should be better. The company guided for adjusted earnings per share to rise by \"high single digits to low double digits\" this year. </p><p>\n  But a new unknown has arisen: On Nov. 18, a U.S. Tax Court judge ruled that the company placed too much of its profit in its lower-tax foreign operations. The ruling didn't determine how much the company owes, but the Internal Revenue Service had been seeking more than $3.3 billion for the tax years 2007 through 2009. </p><p>\n  Coca-Cola says it will appeal and believes it will ultimately prevail, going so far as to call the government's case unconstitutional. It booked a relatively modest $438 million tax reserve in 2020. But it also said that under a worst-case scenario in which the IRS's logic is applied to subsequent years past 2009, it could face a total liability of around $12 billion, equal to a bit more than 5% of its market value, and its future underlying effective tax rate could go up by around 3.5 percentage points. When asked by an analyst on the call, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy didn't specifically rule out an impact on the company's dividend under a worst-case scenario, but instead offered general assurances that the company's strong balance sheet and cash generation allow it to \"manage any scenario.\" </p><p>\n  Given the tax risk, Coca-Cola shares don't look particularly tempting at around 23 times forward earnings, in line with Pepsi's multiple and its own long-term average. Investors have plenty of other ways to play a summer reopening without having to consider the finer points of tax law. </p><p></p>",
