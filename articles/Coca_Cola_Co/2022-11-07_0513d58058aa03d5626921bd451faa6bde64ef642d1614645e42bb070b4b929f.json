  "text": "<p>The Global Plastics Policy Centre was launched at last year's COP26 to help find sustainable solutions to tackle plastic pollution. However, with companies like Coca-Cola continuing to increase production of virgin plastics, this solution seems to be slipping further away from fruition (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/662d4a0d-e8f5-4cd4-b03f-05b97e13e771\">Report</a>, November 3).</p> <p>At COP27, governments must crack down on plastic usage. However, they must also discuss funding sustainable biopolymer research. </p> <p>Many bioplastics are still derived from materials that can't fully degrade in normal conditions and damage the environment when not disposed of correctly. If we are to find a solution to plastic pollution, we must then fund the organisations' developing materials that can degrade naturally without industrial catalysts.</p> <p>The science is already there, with many new materials achieving biodegradability certification following robust OECD 310 testing. The question is, will it be relayed to world leaders at COP27?</p> <p><strong>Duncan Clark</strong> <br><em>Teysha Technologies <br>London EC2, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: COP27 must be made aware of plastic solutions' FT.com 7 November.
