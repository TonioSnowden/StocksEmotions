  "title": "Business News: Coca-Cola's Profit, Revenue Squeezed By the Pandemic",
  "text": "<p>Coke expects high-single-digit percentage growth in organic revenue, which excludes currency swings and acquisitions or divestitures, in 2021. On that basis, Coke's revenue fell 9% in 2020.</p><p>The company reported declines in both profit and revenue in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Depressed sales from restaurants and bars more than offset gains from consumers drinking sodas at home. The company said world-wide volume fell 3% in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Layoffs and other cost-cutting measures helped the Atlanta giant mitigate those declines and improve its operating profit margins. In December the company said it would cut 2,200 of its 86,000 workers. It also focused on its core brands.</p><p>Quarterly net income was $1.46 billion, down from $2.04 billion in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share rose to 47 cents from 44 cents, Coke said, beating the FactSet consensus of 42 cents. Revenue fell 5% to $8.61 billion.</p><p>Coke also disclosed for the first time that it faces a potential $12 billion tax liability from a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. The U.S. Tax Court sided with the IRS last year, ruling that Coke placed too much of its profit in its foreign operations instead of in its higher-taxed domestic parent company.</p><p>The company, which had total income tax costs in 2020 of $2 billion, said it didn't take the full effect of the ruling into account because it was confident that it would win on appeal. Instead, it took a charge for 4% of the potential $12 billion cost. Coke hasn't yet filed its appeal.</p><p>---</p><p>Richard Rubin contributed to this article.</p>",
