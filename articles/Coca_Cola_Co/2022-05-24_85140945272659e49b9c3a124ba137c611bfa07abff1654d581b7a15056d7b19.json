  "text": "<p>Those were the days before the polio vaccine, when sharing a drinking source was forbidden. I was hot and decided to take a long sip. It was the coolest, best drink of water I'd ever had.</p><p>Fortunately, nothing happened. But at that moment, as I savored the taste, I decided that going forward I'd trust my instincts. I knew that if I always did what was expected of me, I'd miss out on wonderful things.</p><p>In Quitman, Texas, we lived in a house my dad built. The bottom was Austin stone and the top was wood that he painted green. The sides were covered with red roses climbing over redwood trellises. Our town was tiny and idyllic.</p><p>more house call</p><p>* How 'Doing Nothing' Became a Hollywood Career Strategy for Tracy Letts</p><p>* Mike Myers on Rejecting Rejection: 'Failure Is Just an Early Attempt at Success'</p><p>* Three Tragedies Didn't Keep 'Bosch' Star Titus Welliver From the Stage</p><p>I always seemed to have an inside self and an outside self. The outside self did everything that was expected of me. But my inside self was most important. It was who I really was and what I really thought about things.</p><p>My father, Edwin, was a water-and-soil conservationist who worked for the Texas A&amp;M University Agricultural Extension Service. He loved my spunk and felt I'd need that in life.</p><p>He grew up in central Texas, an area of cotton fields and black soil. My mother, Virginia, was from the Rio Grande Valley, and as kids we spent a lot of time there climbing citrus trees in my grandparents' backyard.</p><p>My two older brothers let me tag along and looked out for me, so I had more interesting experiences than most little girls my age. Ed was five years older and Robbie was older by 16 months.</p><p>We shared a room, the three of us, until we were in elementary school. I had one little corner for my toys and dolls.</p><p>From an early age, I had a passion for how things felt, smelled, tasted and sounded. There wasn't that much going on in my hometown. It was mostly nature. The smell of flowers and trees and fresh-cut grass was a big deal for me.</p><p>When my mom's friends came over for coffee, rather than shoo me away, she let me stick around and play under the table. I was privy to all sorts of stories and interesting characters.</p><p>Summers were the most fun. My friends and I had adventures on our ponies, chewed on chunks of tar that tasted like smoked taffy and scavenged for Coke bottles to collect the deposit change.</p><p>At age 12, I ordered a Silvertone guitar out of the Sears catalog. I played that thing for hours every day and let my inside self emerge and sing her little heart out.</p><p>I never made it into any of the school plays because, as the drama teacher told my mother one day in the grocery store, \"Sissy didn't learn her lines.\"</p><p>But there were plenty of hard times, too. After I was born, my mother lost two babies. Then, when I was a high-school junior in 1967, Robbie was diagnosed with leukemia. The news turned my world upside down. We rallied around him, but Robbie died. It was the fall of my senior year, but school didn't mean much anymore. Nothing did.</p><p>After high school, I went to college for a week, but the allure of the big city called.</p><p>I left for New York with my guitars and a small suitcase. I sang in clubs and found work as a model in an ad for Chanel No. 5 perfume. But I was 5-foot-2, and my modeling career was short-lived.</p><p>I enrolled in the Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute and learned about the sense-memory technique. To my surprise, I started to get acting roles.</p><p>My career turning point was \"Badlands,\" in 1972. It was a life-altering experience. I got to work with Terrence Malick on his first film. I also met and fell in love with Jack Fisk, the film's art director, whom I later married.</p><p>Today, Jack and I live on a Virginia farm we bought in 1978. When the pandemic hit, Jack finished off a pair of cottages for our two daughters and their families. We spent the pandemic together.</p><p>On my living-room mantle is a yellow skateboard that Robbie built using roller-skate wheels. Whenever I see it, Robbie is present.</p><p>Sissy's Memories</p><p>What is \"Night Sky\" about? It's a science-fiction drama series. I play Irene York, who has a portal in her yard to another planet.</p><p>Blood in \"Carrie\"? They used Karo syrup with red food coloring. They even warmed it up before they dumped it on me.</p><p>How did it feel? Like a warm blanket at first. As it dried, it became sticky.</p><p>Hometown nostalgia? Mostly in the spring.</p><p>Why? When I'm outdoors and the grass and hay are being cut, I smell everything blooming. That takes me back to Texas.</p><p>Small-Town Life Helped Sissy Spacek Prize Drama</p>",
