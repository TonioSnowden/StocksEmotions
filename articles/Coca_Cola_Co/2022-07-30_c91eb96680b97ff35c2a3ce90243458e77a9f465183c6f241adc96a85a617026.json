  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  America's New Energy Crisis:  Five Lessons in  High Energy Costs",
  "text": "<p>\n  As energy prices soar throughout the U.S. this year, Americans are feeling the pain in nearly every corner of their lives. </p><p>\n  From gasoline to electricity, propane to fertilizer, the basic materials businesses need -- many of them derived from fossil fuels -- are in short supply, helping push inflation to the highest level in four decades and stoking concerns that the U.S. may be sliding into a recession. </p><p>\n  The underlying price spikes -- oil up more than 25% and natural gas more than double since the start of the year -- are helping make the cost of doing business more expensive for everything from taco trucks in San Francisco to shrimp boats in Louisiana, pressuring the small entrepreneurs that make up the overwhelming majority of U.S. businesses. </p><p>\n  Here's what rising energy costs look like for people across America. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Beekeeper </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Armond Wilbourn fell in love with beekeeping about eight years ago and decided to pursue his passion as a business. </p><p>\n  His Noble Honey Co. now sells honey, peach honey pops, honey lemonade, bee pollen, candles and lip balm locally at farmers markets and shops, and also ships nationwide. His apiary has grown to 26 beehives outside Atlanta and in the Georgia mountains. </p><p>\n  \"It is the most rewarding work I've ever done,\" said Mr. Wilbourn, 32. </p><p>\n  He hopes to expand to as many as 150 hives, but high fuel prices have led him to pause those plans. Mr. Wilbourn is spending around $75 on gasoline every day, he said, up about $20 from last year, as he navigates greater Atlanta's urban sprawl to check on his bees and sell his wares. </p><p>\n  \"We do four or five farmers markets in different areas of Atlanta, and they're all spread out,\" Mr. Wilbourn said. </p><p>\n  Weekly deliveries include 2 gallons of honey to the restaurant and bar at the historic Fox Theatre and stops at stores and restaurants. </p><p>\n  \"I'm actually looking at probably picking up a part-time job just to pay for gas,\" said Mr. Wilbourn. \"Serving tables, something like that, to help with the cash-flow issues.\" </p><p>\n  In addition to gasoline, Mr. Wilbourn has to buy diesel for his tractor at more than $5 a gallon, up 62% since last year. </p><p>\n  Mr. Wilbourn gave up a rented workspace and moved his office and bottling operations to his home's basement, saving on rent but causing a jump in electricity and water bills for his family of four. </p><p>\n  \"The money's not flowing like it was last year,\" Mr. Wilbourn said. </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Hiller </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Taco Truck Operator </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For 33 years, Beto Quintanar's family has run a taco truck in San Francisco. He is about to take it over from his father, Rafael. </p><p>\n  But his excitement is tempered by his current reality: The El Norteno Taco Truck has had to raise prices on everything from tortas to nachos in response to rising costs. </p><p>\n  The total costs to run El Norteno are up as much as 50% over last year, said Mr. Quintanar, 38. The truck and its generator run on gasoline. Propane powers the grill and steam table. </p><p>\n  All that fuel now costs more than $2,000 a month, up about 33% from the prior year. That's only part of the business's fuel-related expenses. </p><p>\n  Mr. Quintanar pays about $200 a week for the gas he needs for his daily drive about 28 miles from San Rafael, Calif., to the taco truck's usual spot at a public parking lot in San Francisco's South of Market district, then to the commissary where the truck is and stored, and back home again. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, Rafael, who started selling tacos in San Francisco in 1989, takes another vehicle roughly every other day to various suppliers, looking for the best prices for hundreds of pounds of beef, chicken, pork and produce. Those ingredients have gone up in price as much as 50% this year. </p><p>\n  As a result, the Quintanar family raised prices for regular tortas, a kind of Mexican sandwich, to $11 from $10; for nachos to $13.75 from $12.75; and for energy drinks and Mexican Coca-Cola to $3.50 from $3, he said. A side of avocado that used to go for 50 cents now costs $2. </p><p>\n  While customers playfully needle Mr. Quintanar about paying more for their favorite orders, there's little he can do about it. Gasoline sells for an average $5.76 a gallon in San Francisco, among the highest prices in the country, according to AAA. </p><p>\n  \"They complain about the price, but I'll still see them there,\" Mr. Quintanar said of his customers. \"We're all in this boat.\" </p><p>\n  -- Collin Eaton </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Corn Farmer </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Irrigation season is just starting on Mark Weber's Nebraska farm, where the vagaries of weather will determine the cost to harvest this season's corn and soy crop. </p><p>\n  Much rides on unpredictable rainfall, which dictates how much Mr. Weber must run his diesel-fueled irrigation pumps. He spent $52,000 on diesel, gasoline and propane last year. He projects that will rise this year to $80,000 to $90,000. </p><p>\n  The increases in fuel prices over past several months have sent the cost of food production soaring, and alongside it, the price of groceries. </p><p>\n  Chemicals derived in part from fossil fuels, including herbicides to control weeds and fungicides to control disease, are up 15% to 20% from last year. </p><p>\n  Fertilizer made from natural gas has galloped ahead of other costs. Anhydrous ammonia, a source of nitrogen fertilizer used heavily for corn production, was $1,425 a ton this spring, triple 2021's price. If Mr. Weber uses around the same amount of anhydrous ammonia as last year, it would cost $160,000, up from $54,000. </p><p>\n  While his costs are rising, the value of his crops is up, too, thanks in part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has crimped the global supply of agricultural products. Assuming average yields, Mr. Weber should make a profit, though cost increases will dent it. The government expects a broad measure of farm profits to dip 4.5% this year. </p><p>\n  \"It's been a volatile time in the agriculture markets and in energy,\" said Mr. Weber, 65, who worked for five years as a mechanical engineer before returning to Adams, Neb., to help operate the family farm. \"We're seeing good returns and healthy margins for our corn and soy. How long is this going to last?\" </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Hiller </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Excavator </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Chris Chico was 5 years old the first time he used an excavator to dig a hole in a gravel pit. By 16, he was a seasoned logger. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chico's father had planned from the get-go for his son to one day take over the family land-clearing business in southern Vermont. </p><p>\n  With diesel prices hitting a historic high this year and record-high inflation touching virtually everything else he needs, the 34-year-old excavator has never seen costs climb as much as they have recently. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chico's fleet of dump trucks, excavators, bulldozers, track loaders and other heavy equipment consume about 500 gallons of diesel a week to yank up trees, build driveways, prepare foundations and do other work to pave the way for new homes at Vermont's Stratton Mountain. </p><p>\n  Soaring costs for fuel and construction materials have forced Chico Excavating &amp; Property Management LLC, based in Arlington, Vt., to raise prices as much as 30%. </p><p>\n  \"It seems like everything circles around the price of a barrel of oil,\" said Mr. Chico. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chico's company spends almost $13,000 a month on diesel, about 75% more than in the past few years. Not only are diesel prices near historic highs, but costs for the quarry materials he needs have also surged. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chico spends about $100 every other day filling up his own diesel pickup truck, which he drives to work 30 to 40 miles, each way, daily. His company's dump trucks, which carry materials from quarries to his job sites, are driven about 200 miles a day, often uphill across Stratton Mountain. That costs about $500 a day. </p><p>\n  All told, Mr. Chico's costs have gone up as much as 40% in the past year, he estimated. </p><p>\n  One customer walked away from a project recently when the estimated cost rose 25%. \"We're cringing when we put it to paper,\" Mr. Chico said, referring to his bills. </p><p>\n  -- Collin Eaton </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Shrimper </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  As he enters hurricane season, Acy Cooper Jr. is facing a different kind of storm: Fuel costs at his Louisiana shrimping business are spiking, just as Gulf Coast shrimp prices have cratered. </p><p>\n  A recent influx of cheap imported shrimp has depressed the price Mr. Cooper receives for his catch at the docks. His large shrimp fetch around $1.50 a pound, down from $4 last year. Some smaller shrimp bring just 30 cents a pound. </p><p>\n  \"Every commodity in this country is going up and our shrimp are going down,\" said Mr. Cooper, a third-generation shrimper who works with his sons, Acy III and Chris, out of Venice, La. </p><p>\n  The Coopers depart in the late afternoon, fish overnight when the shrimp are most active and return the next morning. A good catch can be 3,000 to 4,000 pounds, worth $4,500 to $6,000, but some nights the catch might just be a few hundred pounds, not enough to cover fuel. </p><p>\n  At more than $5 a gallon for diesel, it costs $600 to $700 for the 120 to 130 gallons needed to operate each of his three boats for a night. </p><p>\n  Oil changes cost around $150 every few weeks, including filters and $89 in oil that a year ago cost $40. </p><p>\n  \"Fuel prices just outweigh everything that we can possibly do right now,\" said Mr. Cooper, 62. </p><p>\n  Mr. Cooper, president of the Louisiana Shrimp Association, had a heart attack April 1, his second. He said a lifetime of hard work on the water is catching up with him: \"This is all I've ever done.\" </p><p>\n  Still, he hopes his grandchildren have the option to become fifth-generation Louisiana shrimpers. \"We had bad years in the past that we overcame,\" he said. </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Hiller </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Aspiring Shopkeeper </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Tammy Ryan bought a vacant 1890s-era general store in western New York state a few years ago, with fixer-upper dreams. </p><p>\n  She renovated the four-bedroom upstairs apartment, where she lives with her boyfriend, daughter and four grandchildren. Next up were plans to reopen the downstairs storefront as a grocery and deli on Main Street in Pike, N.Y., about 50 miles southeast of Buffalo. </p><p></p>",
