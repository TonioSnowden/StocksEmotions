  "text": "<p>It was probably inevitable. With cigarette packages required to feature labels telling customers the product inside will make them die, Philip Morris International's stance is the corporate version of \"Stop me before I kill again.\"</p><p>Which brings us to my late father, and to the job he was able to find as a young man during the Great Depression -- a job that sounds just about impossible today.</p><p>He'd had to drop out of school because his own father was very ill, and he needed to support his mother. Philip Morris hired him, for $18 a week, to travel the northwest quadrant of Ohio and hand out free samples of cigarettes. There was no real controversy about smoking in those years -- it was just something that people did, like drinking Coca-Cola or eating hot dogs. His duties included restocking stores, saloons and candy shops.</p><p>What defined his job, though, was giving away those free cigarettes as a gesture of goodwill. People loved to see him coming, because they had been charmed by Philip Morris's quasi-spokesman: a diminutive fellow named Johnny Roventini who, in the uniform of a hotel bellhop, cried out in movie-theater commercials, radio spots and on the pages of national magazines: \"Call for Philip Mooorrrrisssss!\"</p><p>My dad, in an audiotaped account of his life he recorded for my brother, my sister and me shortly before his death in 1998, said that any time he entered a room with his sample case, the people would loudly and affectionately \"make that call, which made me feel pretty good, being identified as the Philip Morris representative.\"</p><p>When the U.S. entered World War II, he exited Philip Morris to join the Army. But in the battle zones of North Africa and Europe, he learned that Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies regarded the war as another big promotional opportunity, with a more captive audience than the denizens of the hotel lobbies and barrooms where young men like him had handed out those samples. Cartons of cigarettes were shipped free to soldiers -- individual packs were even included in the rations the men fighting the war received each day. By the time the victory was won, they came home with the cigarette habit.</p><p>It was a different world -- and now Philip Morris International says it can envision \"a world without cigarettes,\" a corporate position that would have startled and confused my dad. On that tape, he said that before the war he would hand out his wares at dance halls: \"And it was a wonderful thing to see hundreds of young people crowded around the bandstand and listening to Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, the Dorseys and the like. Those days were never to be repeated. But of course, we didn't know that.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Greene's books include \"Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War.\"</p>",
