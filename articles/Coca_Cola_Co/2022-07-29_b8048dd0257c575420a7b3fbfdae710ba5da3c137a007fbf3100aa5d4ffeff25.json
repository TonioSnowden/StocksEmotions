  "title": "Business News:  Hershey  Lifts Its  Outlook as  Sales Rise  ----  By Connor Hart",
  "text": "<p>   Hershey Co. on Thursday raised its outlook for the year after reporting a rise in second-quarter sales and revenue, as consumers continued to buy candy even with higher prices. </p><p>   The company did warn inflation and fewer government benefits compared with last year will cut into consumers' buying power, but it said that profit from increased sales and higher prices will blunt some of those headwinds. </p><p>   The maker of Reese's peanut butter cups and Twizzlers candy said revenue increased 19% in the second quarter. Excluding recent acquisition and currency translation, Hershey said organic sales were up 14.1%. </p><p>   The company joins the likes of other consumer-product companies, such as Coca-Cola Co., Unilever PLC, whose products include Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Dove shampoo, and Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper, that have raised prices and said consumers are continuing to purchase their products. </p><p>   For the three months ended July 3, Hershey reported a profit of $315 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $301.2 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. </p><p>   Stripping out one-time items, adjusted second-quarter earnings were $1.80 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.69, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Revenue came in at $2.37 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet anticipated revenue of $2.24 billion. </p><p>   For the year, Hershey now expects sales to rise 12% to 14%, up from a prior view of 10% to 12% growth, and per-share earnings to rise 9% to 12%, up from 8% to 11%. </p><p>   Shares closed 2.8% higher on Thursday. As of the market close Wednesday, they were up almost 13% for the year. </p><p></p>",
