  "text": "<p>Take the University of Chicago, which asks among its 2022-23 application essay questions: \"What advice would a wisdom tooth have?\"</p><p>\"What am I supposed to do with that?\" says Rachel, who is 16 years old and still weighing where she will apply.</p><p>Back-to-school season is approaching, and for many rising high-school seniors, so is the grinding process of applying to college. Most college applications -- including the Common Application and the Coalition for College -- opened on Monday. A key part of the frothing madness of college-admissions season: crafting the perfect essay.</p><p>Essays might now carry more weight in the increasingly competitive admissions process as about 72% of schools have already made college entrance exams optional next year, a shift away from standardized tests that accelerated during the pandemic. These teenage treatises are a chance to shine creatively, and often, to stare bleary-eyed at a blank computer screen.</p><p>Advice offered by colleges makes clear the pitfalls. \"Proofread, proofread, proofread,\" cautions Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., under essay tips on its website. \"There's a difference between 'tutoring children' and 'torturing children' and your spell-checker won't catch that.\"</p><p>Then there is the tortuous business of tackling the essay questions themselves. Some schools stick with fairly standard snoozers, such as \"Why this college?\" or \"How did you learn from and overcome an obstacle?\"</p><p>Others get more eccentric, though -- schools say -- with a purpose.</p><p>Peter Wilson, the University of Chicago's director of admissions, explained what whimsical prompts, such as the school's wisdom-tooth query, can drill down and extract from the applicants: \"How do they think? How do they play with ideas?\" Off-the-wall prompts, which have long been a tradition at the school, also tell the applicant something about the university. \"Constantly pushing boundaries and creativity, that's the type of culture we create here.\"</p><p>The University of Maryland, College Park, has asked students to detail their favorite thing about . . . last Tuesday. That's a tough one if your Google Calendar shows a lot of white space. One college-admissions consulting blog advises, \"If you laid in bed all day Tuesday, but went for a beautiful hike on Wednesday, write about the hike.\"</p><p>Chapman University asks applicants to name one dish they would cook for the school's admission team. Princeton University, meanwhile, has asked \"What song represents the soundtrack of your life at this moment?\" To get into Pomona College, last year's seniors had to answer, in 50 words or less, \"Marvel or DC? Pepsi or Coke? Instagram or TikTok? What's your favorite 'this or that' and which side do you choose?\"</p><p>Wake Forest University has asked students to give a top 10 list with the theme of their choice. The University of Vermont asks applicants a brain freezer, related to a Vermont brand: \"Which Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream flavor (real or imagined) best describes you?\"</p><p>Ava Eros, who faced the essay question, picked the limited-edition \"Chip Happens,\" a chocolate-ice-cream base with fudge chips and swirls of potato chips. The combination served as a metaphor for her twists and turns in adolescence, from losing a track and field race to gaining self-confidence.</p><p>\"Honestly, I've never tried Chip Happens before,\" she says. \"I usually get Half Baked.\"</p><p>The University of Vermont accepted her but she chose to attend the University of Pittsburgh, where she will be a sophomore in the fall.</p><p>Rice University has a longstanding tradition -- a prompt known as \"The Box\" -- to ask applicants to submit a captionless image that appeals to them, in lieu of an essay.</p><p>Yvonne Romero DaSilva, vice president for enrollment at Rice, says more than a few applicants have sent a photo of rice -- the actual grain. \"One might consider that clever,\" she says. \"But it's been done so many times that it proves to be unoriginal.\"</p><p>The University of Chicago might get Latin honors in unconventional essay prompts. Each year, applicants must answer one of a few essay questions. The queries are drawn from ideas submitted by admitted, current and former students. Applicants can also dig through the school's essay-prompt archives and pick questions from previous years, including: \"Who does Sally sell her seashells to?\" and \"So where is Waldo, really?\"</p><p>Bethel Agyeman, 16, a rising high-school senior from Fairfax County, Va., read the school's essay questions and thought, \"This has to be a joke.\" One really baffled her: \"Genghis Khan with an F1 racecar. George Washington with a Super Soaker. Emperor Nero with a toaster. Leonardo da Vinci with a Furby. If you could give any historical figure any piece of technology, who and what would it be, and why do you think they'd work so well together?\"</p><p>\"I do like how creative they are with these,\" she says, \"but I prefer prompts that are more cookie-cutter.\"</p><p>Leah Beach, from Houston, relished the university's unusual prompts when she applied last year.</p><p>One intrigued her: \"The word floccinaucinihilipilification is the act or habit of describing or regarding something as unimportant or of having no value. It originated in the mid-18th century from the Latin words 'floccus,' 'naucum,' 'nihilum' and 'pilus' -- all words meaning 'of little use.' Coin your own word using parts from any language you choose . . .\"</p><p>Creativity struck her one day as she walked the empty hallways of her high school, searching for her lost Yeti water bottle. She says she felt a combination of displacement and tranquility.</p><p>Her word: solipsilocosm, derived from \"sol,\" meaning alone or comfort in Latin, \"psil,\" meaning bare in Greek and containing the Latin root \"sil,\" meaning quiet, and \"cosm,\" or universe.</p><p>Once accepted, she could submit an essay prompt for the next class. She got her idea while watching a documentary that featured the Al Yankovic song \"Bob,\" whose lyrics and title are all palindromes.</p><p>Her suggestion inspired one of University of Chicago's 2022-23 essay prompts, according to the school. It reads: \"Was it a cat I saw? Yo-no-na-ka, ho-ka-ho-ka na-no-yo (Japanese for 'the world is a warm place'). Moze jutro ta dama da tortu jezom (Polish for 'maybe tomorrow that lady will give a cake to the hedgehogs'). Share a palindrome in any language, and give it a backstory.\"</p>",
