  "text": "<p>Tigta has requested information about whistleblower cases that died within the IRS or have sat inside the agency for years, the person said. The office also has expressed an interest in the IRS's use of tools created by Congress to combat abusive tax practices, such as a federal law intended to dissuade companies from engaging in transactions that have no economic purpose other than to minimize their tax bills, the person said.</p><p>\"Tigta is planning an audit to assess the adequacy of processes and procedures to identify and prevent IRS conflicts of interest or preferential tax treatment to large businesses and international companies and their representatives in tax compliance matters,\" a spokesman for the inspector general said in a statement.</p><p>It is unclear how the Tigta review will be received within the IRS, which regularly audits large companies and is deep into litigation against several of them, including Facebook Inc., now known as Meta Platforms Inc.; Eaton Corp.; Coca-Cola Co.;and Whirlpool Corp. The companies have generally defended their transactions as following the law.</p><p>An IRS spokesman declined to comment on the audit but said agency officials follow federal conflict-of-interest rules. IRS employees are bound by law and regulations that bar them from participating in matters that could affect their financial interests or raise questions about their impartiality.</p><p>The inspector general's audit was welcomed by whistleblower attorneys, who said they hoped it would spur greater collaboration between the agency and their clients on cases involving multinational companies that use complex tax-avoidance structures or transactions that are difficult for the IRS to spot without insider knowledge.</p><p>The IRS whistleblower program is perceived among those in the industry as less effective than comparable programs in the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department. These programs provide whistleblowers who provide useful information to the agencies a cut of money recovered by the government.</p><p>The SEC and IRS programs have each awarded roughly $1 billion to whistleblowers since their inception, according to annual reports, but the IRS program is three years older.</p><p>Tigta alerted the IRS to the audit in November. The Tigta spokesman declined to comment on whether the inspector general's office intends to investigate specific allegations of conflicts of interest and preferential treatment or limit its review to IRS policies and systems to prevent such conduct.</p><p>The Tigta spokesman said that the audit is in a planning phase and that the inspector general's office hasn't finalized the scope or time frame of the review.</p><p>The Tigta audit overlaps with requests by members of Congress for more information about the revolving door at the IRS and the Treasury Department.</p><p>In October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) sent letters to large accounting firms for information about employees who had rotated in and out of government positions. The letters cited a New York Times article last year that identified 35 examples of lawyers at large accounting firms leaving for government jobs and then returning to their old firms.</p><p>The firms declined to provide a full accounting of their employees in response to the letters, the lawmakers said. Collectively, the firms disclosed that at least 24 employees had left for government jobs and returned since 2001, according to Ms. Warren and Ms. Jayapal.</p><p>The lawmakers sent a letter in February to J. Russell George, inspector general for tax administration, and the deputy inspector general of the Treasury Department, Richard Delmar, requesting that they open \"an inquiry into the revolving door between the country's top accounting firms and the federal government.\"</p><p>The lawmakers registered particular concern about employees from big accounting firms taking tax-policy positions, but the months-old Tigta audit appears to be looking at whether the IRS has a revolving-door problem that could directly impact compliance tools and cases.</p><p>The IRS spokesman declined to comment on the letters.</p><p>Tigta has told the IRS that as part of its audit, the inspector general's office plans to seek interviews with and information from officials in the IRS appeals and chief counsel offices, the Large Business and International Division and the whistleblower office, among others, according to a November email from the inspector general to IRS officials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think the IRS is aggressive enough in auditing large companies? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Though the audit is in an early stage, the inspector general's office has begun to look at the IRS's application of a 2010 law that imposes a 40% penalty on taxes avoided through transactions that lack \"economic substance,\" according to the person familiar with the audit. The so-called Economic Substance Doctrine became law as part of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the provision would raise $4.5 billion over a decade. In 2015, when Congress was considering repealing the Affordable Care Act, congressional scorekeepers estimated that eliminating the Economic Substance Doctrine would cost the Treasury $5.8 billion over a decade. Those figures typically attempt to project revenue from penalties as well as higher compliance.</p><p>There is a \"fairly thin\" record of the IRS asserting the doctrine in cases since 2010, said Michael Desmond, who was the IRS chief counsel during the Trump administration.</p><p>The 40% strict-liability penalty—meaning it can't be waived by the IRS—raises the stakes of any audit in which it is applied, increasing the chances of prolonged litigation as the IRS weighs the use of its limited resources, said Mr. Desmond, now a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP.</p><p>Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com</p><p>IRS Is Audited Over Its Safeguards Against Favored Treatment of Big Business</p>",
