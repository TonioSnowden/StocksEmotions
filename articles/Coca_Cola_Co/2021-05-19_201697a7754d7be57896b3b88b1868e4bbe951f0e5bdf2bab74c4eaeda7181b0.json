  "title": "Banking & Finance: These Investments Aren't ESG --- Conservative managers woo investors unhappy with political stances at some companies",
  "text": "<p>Whether conservatives will move money from more traditional investments to funds that hold shares in companies that are either neutral or lean conservative on political questions remains to be seen.</p><p>ESG -- environmental, social and governance -- funds are popular with progressives who hope to use their dollars to influence companies as well as with others who see growth potential from companies focused on industries such as renewable energy.</p><p>Such investments have ballooned in size in recent years. Morningstar estimates sustainable portfolios in the U.S. last year took in nearly a quarter of all new money across mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.</p><p>The dollar amounts invested so far in the conservative funds are minuscule compared with the trillions in the U.S. stock market. Still, recent growth has been significant.</p><p>Two ETFs run by 2ndVote Advisers LLC near Nashville, Tenn., have grown in the past month from about $6 million to roughly $25 million, representatives say. Money managers at the firm say they hope they will surpass $100 million by the end of the year after adding more portfolio choices and courting pension funds in conservative-leaning states.</p><p>\"It's an investment option for unwoke investors,\" said Andy Puzder, who is on the firm's advisory board. \"We believe that companies that focus on profit make more than companies that don't.\"</p><p>Mr. Puzder is the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the owner of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains. He withdrew in 2017 from consideration to be former President Donald Trump's first labor secretary after questions arose about his past employment of an undocumented housekeeper.</p><p>Other high-profile names involved with 2ndVote Advisers include former Tennessee Congresswoman Diane Black and Kevin Hassett, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in Mr. Trump's administration.</p><p>New ETFs often have a hard time getting off the ground and many fail because of a lack of investor interest. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at financial-data provider CFRA, said funds that grow to assets under management of $100 million or more tend to be more viable.</p><p>The American Conservative Values ETF, which was started just before last fall's election, has seen its assets under management more than triple so far this year, from about $3 million to more than $9 million. The growth \"absolutely validates that demand exists,\" according to Bill Flaig, the founder and chief executive of the fund's suburban-Washington management firm, Ridgeline Research.</p><p>The fund that Mr. Flaig helps oversee \"boycotts\" Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and more than 20 other companies that it views as overly progressive in their corporate politics.</p><p>In April, the American Conservative Values ETF dropped from its portfolio Atlanta-based corporations Delta Air Lines Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., after their executives criticized a new Georgia voting law that civil-rights groups have argued will make voting harder.</p><p>\"I think people will be willing to look at these strategies, if their political affiliation is aligned with the priorities and it performs well,\" Mr. Rosenbluth said. \"If it doesn't perform well, then it's going to struggle to gather assets.\"</p><p>Still, Mr. Rosenbluth is skeptical of demand. He pointed to an ETF created in 2017 with the ticker MAGA -- the same abbreviation for Mr. Trump's \"Make America great again\" campaign slogan. The fund, which has grown to only about $11 million in assets, includes 150 large companies whose employees and political-action committees support Republican candidates.</p><p>Hal Lambert, chief executive of MAGA fund manager Point Bridge Capital, said he thinks there was less motivation to invest in his product when Republicans were in power in Washington. \"With Biden taking over in January, people are getting more and more upset, and I think you will see more people wanting to invest,\" he said.</p><p>2ndVote Advisers started offering two ETFs after last year's presidential election. One fund caters to investors who feel strongly about opposing abortion, while the other is targeted at supporters of gun rights.</p><p>The funds use a \"social scoring system\" that looks at a variety of company information, including direct and indirect donations, activities and stated policies, sponsorship of political and advocacy-related events, donations by corporate leaders, and lobbying efforts for or against various issues on the state and federal level.</p><p>The ETFs invest in companies they view as neutral or conservative on abortion or gun rights, and not necessarily because they deal directly with those issues. A company may be included in one of the funds, even if it isn't viewed as neutral or conservative on all issues.</p><p>As of Tuesday's market close, the abortion-related fund was up 13.8% so far this year and the gun-related fund was up 16.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was up 9.9% year to date.</p><p>As early as this summer, 2ndVote Advisers plans to add funds focused on technology companies that haven't blocked speech by Mr. Trump or other conservatives, companies that have been supportive of Israel, companies involved with the manufacturing and sale of guns and law-enforcement devices and companies involved in U.S. energy production, including renewable energy.</p><p>Mr. Puzder said conservatives have been slower than liberals to move to specialized investments, but that the silencing of Mr. Trump on social-media platforms and corporate involvement in the Georgia election-law debate have fueled interest.</p><p>\"A lot of this has kind of woken up conservatives,\" he said. \"Now, we're catching on.\"</p><p>---</p><p>A Method to Align</p><p>Values, Spending</p><p>The 2ndVote funds have ties to a company former Tennessee Congresswoman Diane Black's husband, David Black, created close to a decade ago that helps conservatives direct their spending to companies and charities that align with their values. Called 2ndVote Inc., it operates a website that ranks companies and nonprofits on a five-point scale for political advocacy.</p><p>Those viewed as strongly supporting liberal values and organizations, either monetarily or through advocacy, are given a one. Those strongly backing conservative values and groups are rated as a five.</p><p>Every company in the S&amp;P 1500 has been rated, as well as some private companies and charities. More than 300,000 people subscribe to a free newsletter about the ratings.</p>",
