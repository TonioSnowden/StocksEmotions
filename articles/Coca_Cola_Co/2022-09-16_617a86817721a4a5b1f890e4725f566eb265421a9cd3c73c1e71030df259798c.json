  "title": "Retired Mexican General Is Arrested in 2014 Student Disappearances; José Rodríguez is accused in the deaths of six of the 43 students who were abducted and killed",
  "text": "<p>Gen. José Rodríguez was arrested along with two other military officials, and an arrest warrant has been issued for a fourth soldier, Deputy Public Security Minister Ricardo Mejía said.</p><p>In September 2014, Gen. Rodríguez was the colonel in charge of the military detachment deployed in the city of Iguala, in the southern state of Guerrero, where the students were abducted. He is the highest-ranking military officer detained so far in connection with the crime, which remains unsolved.</p><p>He turned himself in to authorities Wednesday afternoon and was taken to a military prison where he will be held until he appears before a judge, according to federal records and a senior government official.</p><p>The Attorney General's office had issued an arrest warrant against him last month.</p><p>It couldn't be determined what evidence the government has against Gen. Rodríguez. According to phone messages sent between two members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, included in an investigation launched by Mr. López Obrador's government, six of the students were held alive for four days at a warehouse and handed over to \"the colonel.\" Authorities say that is a reference to Gen. Rodríguez, who at the time was a colonel.</p><p>Gen. Rodríguez couldn't be reached for comment. It couldn't be determined whether he has a lawyer.</p><p>The arrests of the military officers came just days before the eighth anniversary of the crime, with tensions running high in Guerrero state.</p><p>Earlier this week, students held violent protests, throwing rocks and launching homemade rockets against two army bases. They rammed a stolen Coca-Cola truck through the gates of the base in the state capital Chilpancingo and crashed another truck against the gate of the base in Iguala before setting the truck on fire.</p><p>Gen. Rodríguez's arrest comes weeks after the Mexican government publicly presented results of a new investigation into the case, concluding that the abduction and killing of the students was a \"crime of the state\" involving authorities of all levels, from municipal and state police to federal and military authorities.</p><p>According to the new report, former President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration and his attorney general, Jesús Murillo, orchestrated a coverup of the students' disappearance.</p><p>Mr. Murillo was arrested last month in Mexico City on charges of forced disappearance, torture and obstruction of justice. Mr. Murillo, who has pleaded not guilty, is in jail while awaiting trial.</p><p>In his investigation, Mr. Murillo concluded that corrupt police handed the 43 students to the local Guerreros Unidos gang. The gunmen then killed the students in a remote garbage dump near the town of Iguala, incinerated their bodies and threw the ashes into a nearby river, according to Mr. Murillo's findings. This version of events, which Mr. Murillo referred to as \"the historical truth,\" was questioned by human-rights groups and relatives of the missing students.</p><p>The new investigation led by Deputy Interior Minister Alejandro Encinas concluded the students were never together in one group but were killed in different places. Before his arrest, Mr. Murillo said he had never maintained that all of the students were killed at the garbage dump. DNA remains of two students were found in plastic bags recovered from the river.</p><p>Some 400,000 Mexicans have been killed and nearly 90,000 have disappeared since 2007 in an eruption of violence among warring criminal cartels, many times in league with corrupt security forces.</p><p>Parents of the students, who attended a rural teachers college in the hamlet of Ayotzinapa, have insisted for years that the army was involved in the killings, which the Peña Nieto government always denied.</p><p>The school, founded in 1926, is run by Mexico's federation of socialist peasant students, a radical Marxist-inspired group. Some of Mexico's most famous guerrilla leaders during the country's dirty war in the 1970s were graduates of the school.</p><p>The day of the abductions, the Ayotzinapa students had gone to the city of Iguala to commandeer passenger buses to take people to Mexico City for an annual demonstration commemorating a 1968 student massacre. As they attempted to steal the buses, according to both investigations, the students fought with local police who were working for the Guerreros Unidos.</p><p>Analysts say the case has become so politicized over the years that it will be hard to ever know what really happened to the students.</p><p>\"He could be a scapegoat,\" said Alejandro Hope, a Mexico City security analyst, referring to Gen. Rodríguez. \"We will have to look at the evidence.\"</p><p>Mr. Hope said Mr. López Obrador was under pressure to deliver results demanded by the families, while at the same time protecting his close relationship with the military.</p><p>The president has given the Mexican army its most prominent role in government since the 1940s, including building Mexico City's new airport and battling the country's powerful drug cartels.</p><p>According to the new inquiry, which cites more than 4,000 phone communications, other bodies of the students were thrown into a nearby mine, while some others were dissolved in acid.</p><p>Write to Juan Montes at juan.montes@wsj.com and José de Córdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com</p><p>Retired Mexican General Is Arrested in 2014 Student Disappearances</p>",
