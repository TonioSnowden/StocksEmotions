  "title": "Obituaries: Job-Hopping CEO Ran Hertz and Avis",
  "text": "<p>Joseph Vittoria could be viewed as a classic job-hopper. In his case, however, he kept hopping between the same two rental-car companies, Hertz Corp. and Avis Inc.</p><p>In his day, their rivalry rivaled that of Coke and Pepsi. Hertz hired O.J. Simpson to dash through airports in its TV ads. Avis, No. 2 in the car-rental market, promised to try harder. Mr. Vittoria at different times in the 1980s served as chief executive officer of both companies -- a distinction that made him the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question.</p><p>Hertz hired Mr. Vittoria as a management trainee in 1961. Then began two decades of frequent promotions, a few demotions and leaps from Hertz to Avis to Hertz and back again. Frank A. Olson, who was chairman of Hertz, in the early 1980s said Mr. Vittoria was \"a very pleasant, ingratiating individual\" but described his career as strange.</p><p>Hertz once accused Mr. Vittoria of stealing trade secrets when he bolted to Avis. Mr. Vittoria retorted: \"There are no trade secrets in this business.\"</p><p>After retiring from Avis in 1997, he focused on his own rent-a-boat business for luxury sailing yachts. The business started with a 131-foot yacht built in Thailand. Fees were up to $450,000 a week.</p><p>Mr. Vittoria died Jan. 18 at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 85 and had been under treatment for leukemia.</p>",
