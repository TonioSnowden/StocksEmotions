  "title": "Business News: Bill Gates Transfers Deere Shares to Wife",
  "text": "<p>In the securities filing, Mr. Gates indicated he made the disclosure because he and Cascade control more than the 10% stake that triggers a reporting requirement. After the transfer, Mr. Gates and Cascade still owned nearly 29.3 million shares, or 9.3% of the company, they reported.</p><p>A spokesman for Cascade declined to comment beyond the filings. Mr. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., resigned from its board last spring amid a probe into his prior romantic relationship with a female Microsoft employee.</p><p>This month, Mr. Gates transferred stakes in a Coca-Cola bottler, a Canadian railroad, AutoNation Inc. and other companies valued at nearly $2.4 billion to Ms. French Gates, as two of the world's richest people began dividing their wealth.</p>",
