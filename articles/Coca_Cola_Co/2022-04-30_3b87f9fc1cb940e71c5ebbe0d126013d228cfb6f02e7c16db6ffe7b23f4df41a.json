  "text": "<p>Berkshire's insurance-underwriting business reported a decrease in operating profits, while its railroad; utilities and energy; and manufacturing, service and retailing businesses posted growth.</p><p>More coverage</p><p>* Warren Buffett Is Still Setting Berkshire's Direction. For How Much Longer?</p><p>Berkshire's net income can be volatile from quarter to quarter because the company has large stock investments, and it is required to include unrealized investment gains or losses in the figure. While that is a boost to its results when markets are rallying, it hurt Berkshire's earnings in the latest quarter.</p><p>Worries about inflation, tightening monetary policy and slowing growth sent the S&amp;P 500 tumbling to start the year. Berkshire's biggest holding, Apple Inc., took a hit. Shares of the iPhone maker are down 13% in 2022. Other major holdings, like Kraft Heinz Co. and Coca-Cola Co., weathered the market volatility better as shares of companies providing consumer staples gained popularity.</p><p>Mr. Buffett, who is Berkshire's chief executive and chairman, has said he thinks operating earnings are a better measure of how the company is performing.</p><p>Investors curious to hear what Berkshire will do next will get a chance to hear from Mr. Buffettlater Saturday. The 91-year-old investor—alongside right-hand man Charlie Munger and Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain—will speak at Berkshire's first in-person annual shareholder meeting since 2019. Shareholders will pay close attention to Mr. Buffett's views on the markets and the economy, given his decades of investing experience and the vast scale of Berkshire's businesses.</p><p>Based in Omaha, Neb., Berkshire runs a large insurance operation, as well as a railroad, utilities, manufacturers and retailers. Many of its holdings are household names, such as Fruit of the Loom, Geico, Dairy Queen and Benjamin Moore &amp; Co.</p><p>Berkshire also has a massive equity portfolio, which was worth $331 billion at the end of 2021. The company uses billions of dollars of float, or upfront premiums that its insurance customers pay, to make investments for its own gain.</p><p>While most shareholder meetings pass by without much notice, Berkshire's has been lovingly dubbed the \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" given its unusually high turnout, festival-like atmosphere and plethora of memorabilia celebrating Mr. Buffett and his investments. In the past, attendees have taken home souvenirs such as Fruit of the Loom boxers with images of Mr. Buffett printed on them and Oriental Trading rubber ducks created in the likeness of Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger.</p><p>Just half an hour after the convention center where the meeting is set to be held opened its doors to the public, hundreds of attendees had streamed in, with many rushing to claim seats closest to the stage where Mr. Buffett is set to speak.</p><p>The highlight of the weekend will be an hourslong question-and-answer session during which the executives will field inquiries from randomly selected audience members and CNBC reporter Becky Quick.</p><p>Mr. Buffett has said he won't discuss what Berkshire is buying or selling, how Berkshire arrived at an investment decision, or politics.</p><p>\"Any other subjects are fair game,\" he wrote in a program for the event.</p><p>Shareholders might also look to hear Mr. Buffett share his views on various Berkshire shareholder proposals. In April, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, said it was planning to support a proposal that would remove Mr. Buffett as the chairman of Berkshire. Other shareholder proposals are asking Berkshire to disclose more about its efforts to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>Another topic likely to be on investors' minds this weekend: what Berkshire will do with its massive cash reserves. While the company made no major acquisitions in 2021, with Mr. Buffett citing a lack of attractive long-term investment opportunities, it has put more cash to work again this year.</p><p>In March, Berkshire said it had reached a deal to acquire insurer Alleghany Corp. for $11.6 billion. The deal is set to be Berkshire's biggest in years. The company also unveiled it had built a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum in March and disclosed an 11% stake in HP Inc. in April.</p><p>Shares of Occidental and HP soared following news of Berkshire's investments.</p><p>The company still has a mountain of cash it can tap. Berkshire had $102.69 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter, down from a near-record $144 billionat the end of 2021 .</p><p>Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Fall on Investment Losses</p>",
