  "title": "It was back to nature at Men's Fashion Week in Paris, with clothes sprouting real grass",
  "text": "<p>Remember all those Covid-19 “Nature Is Healing” memes, with apparently apocryphal images of animals newly flourishing in hitherto hostile, human-dominated climes? Well, fashion seemed to propose its own versions during the spring/summer 2023 menswear shows in Paris. Jonathan Anderson invented clothes and trainers that sprouted clumps of real vegetation; Kim Jones planted a flower-strewn grassy knoll, then staged a Dior show on it. And a bunch of designers chased away by Covid, including the Japanese talents Junya Watanabe and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, Hedi Slimane of Celine and the American Thom Browne, returned to their natural habitat of Paris Fashion Week, and did what came naturally. Which meant Kawakubo wryly dressed her models as court jesters in towering wigs and clown masks, Slimane dressed his youthful army in raiments of rock-chic, and Browne tomfooled campily in a gilded salon, with models dressed in tweed jockstraps and miniskirts. Which, for Browne, feels entirely natural.</p> <p>There was something natural about the Louis Vuitton show too. The brand's menswear line is without an artistic director following the death of Virgil Abloh last November. An announcement of his successor is imminent (Louis Vuitton chief executive Michael Burke attended designer Martine Rose's show in London, stoking the conjectural flames). But rather than a quiet, anonymous show designed by committee, the Vuitton collection was exuberant, colourful, playful. It didn't feel mournful, even if the team are still mourning. There were oddities like coats embroidered with impressionistic flowers, and suits peppered with paper planes (actually executed in leather), and bags with leather protrusions that resembled the curlicued boiserie of 18th-century Parisian mansions. It also spoke to the nature of a luxury goods house today — Vuitton cannot be shy, or retiring, or even quiet. It has to jostle to grab attention, even under strange and unforeseen circumstances. The brand actually opened and closed its show with a full marching band, as if to emphasise that fact. But this collection was, by its nature, a stop-gap. Change is afoot, but we won't see the shift until next year.</p> <p>The transformation of Dior menswear under Kim Jones is remarkable. A few years ago, the house was staid and predictable — now, it is a creative powerhouse. The remarkable fact of the collection was how simple each outfit appeared and yet, when pulled apart, how complex its components were, each perfectly honed as a creative exercise, and importantly as commercial product. There were crocodile micro-bags and layered shorts and tiny glittering earrings dangling pearls, and Dior's Cannage pattern fretwork into cage-like trainers and EarPod cases. Jones drew connections between Christian Dior and the Bloomsbury artist Duncan Grant, an obsession of his. But as the models trudged across the grass, they wore the inspiration — and product — lightly. And the collection deftly mixed tailoring with sportswear, brief cycling shorts with turned-back waistbands peeking out from under Seventies-ish marathon runners that felt like a heightened version of the reality you see on city streets. That Jones can reflect reality while also sublimating it into something that resonates with luxury consumers — and make it worthy of Dior's prices — is a deft skill. And the macaroon colours of this collection were gorgeous. </p> <p>The power of pastel is one of the few coherent and concrete menswear trends to merge for next spring, and Dior's strong tailoring in raspberry, mint, limoncello or fawny caramels were exceptional. So were Véronique Nichanian's at Hermès, where the mind boggled at the amount of colour on show and yet, so deft was the mix, you hardly even noticed that men meandered in quick successions of turquoise, watermelon, satsuma and an oddly masculine lavender.</p> <p>Anderson's Loewe show was a standout. If Dior is based on tailoring, Loewe is founded on leather — there was plenty here. But there were also experimentations, bizarrely, with growing plants on and in clothing. Chia and cat's wort sprung out of coats, sweatshirts and trousers and athletic sneakers, the result of two years of experimentation with Spanish designer Paula Ulargui Escalona. Coats seemed to entomb relics of contemporary society, like USB drives, headphones or a phone case, in layers of leather, trapping them against the body. And curved masks simultaneously protected the face, and featured LED screens with Shutterstock images of plants or wriggling fish. Anderson himself talked about the progressive thoughts of the Seventies backstage, and “how nature affects technology, and how technology affects nature”. But there was a darkness here, whether that darkness was in humanity's often cataclysmic impact on the natural world or, perhaps, in the impotence of mankind's legacy, subsumed and ultimately destroyed by nature, an unstoppable force that will eat up all our achievement, like the grass chewed up those Loewe coats. It's rare that a fashion show makes you think deep and meaningfully like that.</p> <p>Kawakubo's work always provokes deeper thought — alongside frowns and dismissive commentary. In 1996, she showed a collection of padded dresses that seemed riddled with cancerous tumours and caused a furore. Her spring/summer 2023 menswear collection dressed men as jesters, the hoop-waist of traditional clowning pantaloons mimicked with crinoline inserts to boing out the hems of tailored jackets and shorts, faces hidden behind distorting antique papier-mâché masks. The soundtrack was taken from horror movies. So, what do you think? Comment on the buffoonery of business, the horror of clowns running political systems, or perhaps on the idiocy of the fashion system, of overdressed and extreme fashions, of clustering people back into small rooms, cheek to jowl, as Covid infection rates rise again across the world? Kawakubo never explains.</p> <p>I couldn't help but think of the simplicity of social media discourse, of how transgressions are often called out with the simple use of an emoji of a clown's face. Kawakubo turns 80 this year, and isn't on social media as far as I know. But it's odd how her work intersects with popular culture, as does that of her protégé Watanabe, who paid tribute to pop art in his collection. But his pop art included not only Coca-Cola and Campbell's Soup, but Netflix logos. His prints of Marilyn Monroe, while intentionally clichéd, also connected to the brouhaha over Kim Kardashian's appearance in Monroe's famous “Happy Birthday” dress (now allegedly damaged). They had a new cultural currency that is entirely of this moment.</p> <p>Craig Green's collection didn't feel especially anchored in now. It had an eternal quality, a timelessness that can also be the mark of great fashion. Green was thinking about the phrase “a decorated man.” Rather than medals and frogging and grandeur, he retreated to patchworks of school crests and stencils of Wedgwood patterns on vast robes, and to the potentially archaic suit and tie, the latter preserved in leather protective casings, as if a relic of a past time — which maybe it is. Green also constructed assemblages based on ladders around the body, and attached stirrups as if his man could be a vehicle.</p> <p>There was an odd wearability to much of it — not those ladders, granted, but when you looked at his wrapped layers, it was remarkable than none dragged or impeded, all seemed built to be really worn, to work in the real world, evolved from functional clothing, given extra flair. And, obviously, there was the meat and potatoes of cross-body bags and small accessories and the quilted jackets and denims that have become neat staples of many men's wardrobes, and of Green's business. The great thing is that here, they didn't seem an adjunct to shill a quick buck, but, rather, something that came naturally.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Alexander Fury 2022 'It was back to nature at Men's Fashion Week in Paris, with clothes sprouting real grass' FT.com 28 June.
