  "text": "<p>Activists are meant to shake things up. But when Elliott Management took its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68faf5d2-ae6a-4391-aa64-3ca8ace45715\">campaign against SSE public</a> on Tuesday, the energy group's share price barely stirred. Is the hedge fund losing its power to agitate?</p> <p>Elliott's two latest UK campaigns have been marked by an apparently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b5347ed-0fef-459e-a637-b5de7e7df4a8\">conciliatory tone</a>. </p> <p>There have been some sharp edges: calling for a process to decide whether the chief executive is the best person for her job, as Elliott did at GlaxoSmithKline, is not exactly kind. Choosing SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies' tenure as the period over which to measure underperformance is perhaps a little personal. </p> <p>But at GSK, Elliott has backed the board's central strategy to split the consumer and pharmaceutical divisions. Its main request is for a bit more, a bit faster, please. At SSE, it does not support the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e8b889e-8c7d-4292-8cb6-08e920053246\">board's decision</a> last month to keep a regulated electricity networks business in the same corporate structure as a renewables champion. But it is not seeking to force a full separation on the group — a move it said would unlock another £5bn in value. Nor is it seeking to depose Phillips-Davies. </p> <p>Instead, it is asking for two new independent directors with renewables experience on the board. </p> <p>Innocuous enough. Renewables is one of the company's two core business areas. While SSE can point to directors' experience in infrastructure and energy, it cannot argue convincingly to have renewables heavyweights able to challenge management. </p> <p>Hard for the chair to resist the challenge from Elliott. Easy, though, for other investors to support the activist's appeal. </p> <p>Even those who will not engage in a fight over financial structure can get involved with a governance debate. Frame the argument as one over a corporate split and passive investors may be agnostic: they will own SSE as a component of the FTSE 100 whether it stays as one company or divides into two. But categorise it as a question of good governance and many more shareholders — or their ESG departments at least — will listen to what Elliott has to say. </p> <p>But if Elliott's ambitions at SSE start with governance, it is plain that they do not end there. And by asking for something inoffensive to many investors, Elliott may start something that it is difficult for SSE's board to stop. </p> <p>The problem for SSE's management and their strategy is not the new directors in themselves. The issue is that Elliott wants them to sit with other non-executives on a “strategic review committee” to “reassure investors that SSE's strategy will not be limited to the underwhelming initiatives” the company announced last month. It is clear that Elliott hopes the new directors may tip the balance towards a break-up. </p> <p>Expect SSE to resist for that reason. What may move the needle, though, is time. </p> <p>Phillips-Davies has been chief executive for eight years already and on the board for 19. Finance director Gregor Alexander has a similarly lengthy tenure. Soon, surely, it will become time for them to move on. </p> <p>And soon, probably, it will come time for the company to break up anyway. The strategy it unveiled last month extends only to 2026. A full separation becomes increasingly likely as that date approaches. Elliott, by its mere presence, has a decent chance of accelerating that process. </p> <p>Elliott could have been far more aggressive. Its reputation is fearsome. In Europe its results, though, are not always achieved through brute force. When Elliott went into Whitbread in 2018, it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0882ccd2-4871-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3\">not particularly pugnacious</a>. Yet within four months of Elliott disclosing its investment, Whitbread secured the sale of Costa to Coca-Cola at a price that would have been worth fighting for.</p> <p>Campaigns at GSK and SSE are likely to take longer to come good. And if they do, it may not be because of Elliott's efforts. It is uncontroversial that both currently suffer from a conglomerate discount. GSK's should dissipate at least somewhat when it divides itself next year. SSE will find it hard to resist some kind of separation indefinitely. In any case, Elliott will happily ride the upward wave.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:cat.rutterpooley@ft.com\"><em>cat.rutterpooley@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Why Elliott's campaign against SSE has time on its side ' FT.com 7 December.
