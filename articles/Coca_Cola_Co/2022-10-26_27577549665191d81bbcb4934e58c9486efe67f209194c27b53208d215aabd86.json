  "text": "<p>America's global soft-drink giants are refreshing investors with their ability to keep growing through it all. Coca-Cola on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations on the top and bottom line, following similarly strong results from PepsiCo earlier this month.</p><p>Coca-Cola's organic sales, a closely watched industry measure that strips out the impact of currency movements and mergers, soared 16% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 9.5% growth, according to Visible Alpha. Even including the drag from the extraordinarily strong dollar, which makes foreign-currency revenue worth less in dollar terms, all-in revenue still rose 10% from a year earlier. Crucially, this was thanks to both price increases and underlying volume growth, showing resilient consumer demand for Coca-Cola's brands.</p><p>This follows Pepsi, which on Oct. 12 reported 16% organic growth and 8.8% growth in total revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 3.</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that companies with so much international sales should underperform when the dollar is rising against other global currencies. Last year, Coca-Cola derived 66% of revenue outside North America, while Pepsi, with its more domestically focused Frito-Lay snacks business, got 44% from outside the U.S.</p><p>Exchange rates seem to be a bigger worry for industrial exporters, which have a high concentration of costs in dollars and competitors around the world eager to undercut them on price. For companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, with production costs distributed around the world, iconic brands and strong pricing power, the problem seems manageable. Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy, on a call with analysts on Tuesday, repeatedly stressed that \"we do see a path to generating\" earnings-per-share growth in dollar terms in 2023.</p><p>So far this year, Coca-Cola and Pepsi shares are down 0.4% and up 2.7%, respectively. That somewhat uninspiring performance is still far better than the S&amp;P 500, which has fallen 19.0% this year, and even its consumer staples subindex, which has declined 8.0%.</p><p>Investors look too pessimistic on Coca-Cola in particular. Its shares are down around 10% since mid-August, possibly due to currency worries -- the U.S. Dollar Index is up about 4% over that same time.</p><p>Yet Tuesday's results suggest those fears are overdone. Coca-Cola can keep on sparkling.</p>",
