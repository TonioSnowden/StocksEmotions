  "title": "Business News:  Companies Agree to Change  Recycling Labels to End Suit  ----  By Dieter Holger",
  "text": "<p>   Some of the world's biggest consumer-goods companies agreed to change their U.S. recycling labels for some products after reaching a settlement with an anti-plastic group that said they misled shoppers about the scope of a recycling initiative. </p><p>   Earlier this year, Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit that criticizes companies for plastic waste and poor recycling practices, filed a lawsuit in California against recycling startup TerraCycle Inc. and eight companies it works with, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co., alleging that consumers weren't told about limits on TerraCycle programs that meant their waste might not get recycled. </p><p>   Amid a backlash over plastic waste, TerraCycle has grown fast by signing up companies that pay it to collect and recycle packaging and single-use products. It works with more than 50 brands to collect specific hard-to-recycle items and turn them into new goods, for instance, turning toothbrushes into building materials. TerraCycle collects fees from companies based on how much waste is collected and recycled as well as management fees for setting up and running the programs. </p><p>   Its labels appear on packages for products such as Gerber baby food, Febreze air freshener and Burt's Bees cosmetics. Consumers who want to recycle their waste have to sign up online before sending it to TerraCycle at no cost to them or leaving it at drop-off locations. </p><p>   On Nov. 5, Last Beach Cleanup entered into a settlement with TerraCycle and eight companies that it works with to recycle packaging for certain products. In addition to P&amp;G and Coke, Campbell Soup Co.-owned Late July Snacks, Clorox Co., Colgate-Palmolive Co.-owned Tom's of Maine, Groupe Mom-owned Materne North America, L'Oreal North America, and Nestle SA-owned Gerber Products Co., were part of the settlement. </p><p>   TerraCycle Chief Executive Tom Szaky said what the consumer-goods companies agree to pay sometimes covers only a limited amount of waste. When that happens, people who try to sign up online may be put on a waiting list. </p><p>   Under the settlement, TerraCycle and its partner companies agreed to notify consumers if there is a limit to how many people can sign up due to funding constraints, for instance by including a disclaimer on the packaging saying \"Limited Availability.\" </p><p>   They also agreed not to label products that are part of TerraCycle's program as \"100% recyclable,\" and TerraCycle will enlist a third party to verify what happens to the waste it collects and share the information with Last Beach Cleanup and the companies. TerraCycle's CEO said it was already planning to sign up an auditor. The labeling requirements need to be met by the end of this year and October 2022. Auditing begins next year, but a summary report won't need to be provided until January 2023. </p><p>   Representatives for Clorox, Gerber, Tom's of Maine and P&amp;G said they would continue to work with TerraCycle. Coke and Campbell declined to comment. L'Oreal didn't respond to requests to comment. Mom Group couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   The lawsuit also said it was \"hard to believe\" TerraCycle's claimed recycling rates for the waste it collects, citing much lower industrywide recycling rates. </p><p>   Mr. Szaky said all the Terracycle-branded products the company receives are recycled. TerraCycle has higher recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials than conventional waste management companies, he said, in part because the funding from brands means it can operate outside of the traditional industry. TerraCycle uses third-party processors, but it operates its own sorting centers and in some cases develops its own recycling technology. </p><p>   \"We are not traditional recycling,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
