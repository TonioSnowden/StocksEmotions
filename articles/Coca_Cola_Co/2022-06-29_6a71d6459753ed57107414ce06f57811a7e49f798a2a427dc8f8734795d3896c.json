  "text": "<p>Whitbread, Britain's biggest budget hotel operator, has poached the head of Domino's Pizza UK to replace its chief executive Alison Brittain, who will leave in January after seven years in the top job. </p> <p>Dominic Paul, who has led Domino's in the UK since 2020, was a managing director of Costa Coffee, which Whitbread sold to Coca-Cola in 2018.</p> <p>The owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain has been searching for a new chief executive since Brittain indicated her desire to retire in April. Brittain oversaw the company's £3.9bn sale of Costa Coffee and led its hotel expansion in Germany. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d0b799f1-9393-482d-bc0c-4ae02497e615\">Whitbread</a>'s decision to recruit Paul comes as the group rebounds from a bruising pandemic, but also faces a squeeze on costs from a tight labour market. The company warned in June that it would put £10mn to £15mn towards pay increases in areas particularly hit by labour shortages.</p> <p>The group operates roughly 870 hotels in the UK, Germany and the Middle East as well as pub brands including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre. </p> <p>Whitbread's chair Adam Crozier said he was “delighted to welcome back” Paul as the new chief executive, adding that his record in “growing and transforming consumer brands in the UK and internationally” will help the hospitality group's development plans. </p> <p>Paul was replaced as Costa Coffee's head just nine months after Coca-Cola's takeover of the company. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/b6f706af-26fd-4a0b-bf60-2cdfbe24fd2f\">Domino's</a> said it was starting a process to find his successor and noted that it expected earnings in 2022 to be “in line with current market expectations”.</p> <p>“The strong recovery under Alison's leadership leaves Whitbread very well positioned as a strategic winner in the industry,” Crozier said. </p> <p>The company has had to deal with staff shortages in the hospitality sector and rising energy costs in recent months, while analysts fear that its revenues could be hit by a possible slowdown in consumer spending later in the year. </p> <p>Ivor Jones, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said Paul's job was now to implement Whitbread's “well-thought-out strategy” of increasing its estate and hotels in Germany and the UK. However, he said Whitbread would have to battle against “headwinds” from staff shortages, rising costs and a slowdown in consumer spending which “may make it more difficult to execute the expansion plan”.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Alice Hancock</em></p><p>Source: Oliver Barnes and Emma Dunkley in London 2022 'Whitbread hires Domino's Pizza boss as new chief executive' FT.com 29 June.
