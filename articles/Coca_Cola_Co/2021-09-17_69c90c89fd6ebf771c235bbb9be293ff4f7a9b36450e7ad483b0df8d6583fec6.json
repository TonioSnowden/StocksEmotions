  "text": "<p>WASHINGTONâ€”President Biden said the U.S. is working with the European Union on a pledge to help cut global methane emissions by nearly a third by 2030, and he encouraged other countries to sign on to the effort.</p><p>\"This will not only rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, but it will also produce a very valuable side benefit, like improving public health and agricultural output,\" Mr. Biden said Friday during remarks at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a long-dormant event that Mr. Biden revived ahead of United-Nations-led climate negotiations scheduled for November in Glasgow.</p><p>More than a half dozen heads of state joined Mr. Biden virtually for what he said would be a candid assessment of the threats of climate change. Much of the event was closed to the public.</p><p>The pledge would be the first global commitment to cut emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas less prevalent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but far more potent at trapping heat. Biden administration officials have been working for weeks to get the EU and others to sign on, focusing in particular on the world's largest economies and oil and gas producers.</p><p>Mr. Biden didn't say which other countries had agreed to support the pledge. \"We believe the collective goal is both ambitious, but realistic and we urge you to join us in announcing this pledge at COP26,\" he said, referring to the summit in Glasgow.</p><p>Dubbed the Global Methane Pledge, the agreement doesn't call for country-specific targets, but rather for the signatories to support an effort to reduce global, human-caused methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels.</p><p>Targeting Emissions</p><p>More WSJ articles on climate change, selected by the editors</p><p>* Tallying Emissions Becomes a New Challenge for Companies (Sept. 17)</p><p>* U.S., EU Seek Global Pledge to Slash Methane Emissions by 2030 (Sept. 14)</p><p>* How Much Carbon Comes From a Liter of Coke?
