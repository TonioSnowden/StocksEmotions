  "title": "Business News: Teneo Names Former Xerox CEO As Chairwoman",
  "text": "<p>In taking on the chairwoman role, Ms. Burns, 62 years old, signaled her confidence in the firm after weeks of tumult. \"My reputation is pretty well known,\" she said. \"I put my name on things I believe in.\"</p><p>Ms. Burns added, \"I understand what's ahead of us, and I'm confident that we're ready for the future.\"</p><p>Her appointment comes a week after Mr. Kelly resigned as CEO and chairman and apologized after behaving inappropriately with people at a celebrity-filled event hosted by the charity Global Citizen in early May. Mr. Kelly became drunk and touched women without their consent, the Financial Times reported, citing people who attended the event.</p><p>The charity removed Mr. Kelly from its board on May 3, and General Motors Co. dropped Teneo as an adviser after the details emerged in late June. Last week, Teneo named consulting veteran Paul Keary, one of the firm's co-founders, as its CEO.</p><p>In recent days, Teneo executives have been reaching out to clients to answer questions and reassure them about the firm and its work, current employees say. Teneo employs more than 1,200 people, with its staff including investment bankers, executive recruiters and former public officials.</p><p>Mr. Kelly handled many of Teneo's biggest accounts, personally advising the leaders of General Electric Co. and Coca-Cola Co., and new business often went through him, according to current and former Teneo employees. Another co-founder, Doug Band left Teneo last year.</p><p>Ms. Burns expects to continue working with Teneo clients while adding corporate- governance responsibilities.</p>",
