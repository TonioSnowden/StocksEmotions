  "text": "<p>It's hardly surprising that we've spent more during lockdown on items to keep us entertained while we're stuck at home. </p> <p>According to John Lewis, sales of exercise bikes, treadmills and yoga kit have more than doubled since the start of 2020. Meanwhile, sales of skincare and body products have gone up by a staggering 234 per cent as people replace spa days with stay-at-home treatments. Is this expenditure wise, or will these products end up in the loft, on eBay or in the bin? </p> <p>My pre-lockdown experience of the health and beauty business was mixed. I had a manicure once. Why? I was once invited on as a guest presenter on a home shopping TV channel. They love a “product in hands” close-up.</p> <p>At the salon, I was greeted with a somewhat hostile “What do you do with your nails . . . chew them?” The hair on my hands and fingers was duly waxed off (they're not even that hairy) and a range of lotions massaged in. Despite my aversion to any form of manual labour, my hands apparently tell a different story. This could be the ultimate excuse to avoid my least enjoyed manual domestic chore — unloading the dishwasher. </p> <p>In the event, it was my last turn in front of those cameras. Selling toot that no one needs or wants was not an experience I wish to repeat. As for my nails? I'll stick to the clippers, thanks. </p> <p>With hairdressers in England unable to reopen until April 12, I have been tempted to purchase a pro hair trimmer kit. However, I am still traumatised by the time, as a small child, that I cut my own hair. The results were so bad my teacher telephoned my parents to see if everything was OK at home. </p> <p>But I'm becoming desperate. My hair is curly, so doesn't grow down, it grows out. Its natural bouffant style was fashionable for a week in the 1970s. The longer it gets the more awful it looks, no matter what I do to it. Worse, it's thinning on top and has largely gone grey. I keep telling myself that under lockdown, looking deranged and unkempt is the new slick and presentable.</p> <p>I did have it coloured once, but under intense TV studio lights it had a slightly purple tinge. I'll never have that done again. If you do it yourself and get sweaty, the colouring drips down your face. But I do miss going to a proper salon, the kind that offers a drink whilst you're being coiffed. Mine's a diet Coke with a slice of lemon and lots of ice. That first sip is delicious. Is it because the drink emanates from a glass bottle rather than a standard can? Or you savour the taste knowing how much it cost? </p> <p>Perhaps spending £70 on a haircut is excessive and twice the cost of an upmarket set of clippers. But it's only four times a year. Of course, I am well aware that a barber's shop will do a similar job for a quarter of the price. But I am resolute that home haircuts are not an option. It's perhaps a little easier for men to sit this out — a lady's coiffure is an event, not a function. </p> <p>What about a home massage or skin treatment? Years ago, I was flown to Gstaad for a corporate jolly. The first thing my colleagues did was to book massages, exotic mud and seaweed treatments. Skiing is hard work and it's important if you're touting for business to be on top form. The company was paying and I took up their kind offer. </p> <p>After being covered in some foul-smelling sludge and stinking like a farmyard I was ushered into a “therapy tank” to stew for a while. For a few days after, I looked like a teenager as my skin decided to break out. What a horrific experience. I didn't think much of the hot stones and oil manipulation either. I was told it would be relaxing. It wasn't. I don't know what was worse, the manipulation itself or the inane banter delivered by the perpetrator of the torture. </p> <p>For Christmas I was given a Theragun Prime, a percussive massager. At the time of opening, the other third (I am still on a diet trying to become the other half) told me that this is <em>the</em> thing to have. Initially underwhelmed, I took it out of the nicely designed box. What level of delight should I display? I had no idea that it was a “big” present (£275 a pop), or what it did. </p> <p>After the jokes about it looking like a sophisticated sex toy died away, I was told that this is a magic gadget. Four set speeds and four rubberised attachments simply slot on or off according to the treatment required. Depending upon the ache or pain you wish to massage, and the intensity required, you simply switch it on and apply the pulsating rubber thing. Its chunky and clever design means you can reach any bit of your body. </p> <p>Could it tackle my ongoing back ailment? The results were astonishing. It felt good, if a little violent, during operation. I tried a different attachment on my shoulder that I broke some years ago. On occasion it gets a little stiff. Yes, that worked too! Pricey, but it will pay for itself in around four or five sessions with a massage therapist. </p> <p>However, it is the exception to the rule that many home beauty products are utterly pointless. Foot spa machines, for example — such a faff. Along with natural light mirrors, electric body toners and chest expanders, these are just landfill in the making. </p> <p>On occasion I have hankered for a sunbed. I used to attend a gym whose annual charge was enough to purchase a new, top end piece of equipment every year. It was swanky, and they washed down the machines after you'd exercised. However, I rarely used the place other than to frazzle myself on a sunbed, and pop into the “healthy” restaurant for a delicious burger afterwards. Even though a tan makes any fat body look better, it's not worth the health risk.</p> <p>This purchasing trend will surely be short lived. People up and down the country are becoming increasingly desperate for some form of personalised wellbeing service. Bookings for treatments to clip this, dye that and vajazzle the other are on the up. At some places, waiting lists are into May. </p> <p>There's light at the end of the tunnel. I've had my first vaccine and I'm looking forward to my first haircut. There's so much of it to cut off, it may take a few pounds off my weight as well as my wallet.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>James Max is a radio presenter and property expert. The views expressed are personal.
