  "title": "Burberry begins CEO search after Gobbetti defects to rival",
  "text": "<p>Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti is defecting to rival luxury label Salvatore Ferragamo. </p> <p>Gobbetti plans to leave Burberry at the end of 2021 having notified the board of his intention to step down after nearly five years as CEO. Burberry said the departure was “to take up another opportunity that will enable him to return to Italy and be closer to his family.”</p> <p>Separately, Ferragamo announced that Gobbetti would take up the CEO role as soon as he is released from his contractual obligations.</p> <p>Burberry will now begin the search for a successor, with Gobbetti remaining until the end of the calendar year to ensure an orderly transition. The 61-year-old had presented a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91af77d8-c529-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675\">five-year turnround plan</a> in November 2017.</p> <p>“With Burberry re-energised and firmly set on a path to strong growth, I feel that now is the right time for me to step down,” he said.</p> <p>The surprise departure comes ahead of Burberry's first-quarter results due July 16. Analysts expect the company to deliver like-for-like sales growth as high as 90 per cent year on year as the reopening of the US market helps underpin a continuation of the positive trends in Asia.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Greggs</strong> said the effect of competitors reopening has had a smaller than feared impact on sales. “In recent weeks the impact of pent-up demand for retail has reduced but, nonetheless, like-for-like sales growth in company-managed shops has remained in positive territory ranging between 1 and 3 per cent when measured against the same period in 2019,” it said in a brief trading statement. “This level of sustained sales recovery is stronger than we had anticipated and, if it were to continue, would have a materially positive impact on the expected financial result for the year.”</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong>&#xa0;and <strong>BHP</strong> have finalised deals to sell their one-third stakes in the Cerrejón coal mine&#xa0;in Colombia to joint-venture partner <strong>Glencore</strong> for approximately $294m each.</p> <p><strong>John Wood</strong> said it had reached agreement with the UK Serious Fraud Office and agencies in the US and Brazil to resolve their respective bribery and corruption investigations into the past use of third parties in the Amec Foster Wheeler business.&#xa0;Under the terms of the agreements, John Wood will pay compensation, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, fines and penalties totalling $177m. The oil services group said payments will be phased over the next three years with approximately $62m payable in the second half 2021.</p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola HBC</strong> revealed it has agreed to buy a 30 per cent stake in Caffè Vergnano and will enter into an exclusive distribution agreement for the company's coffee products outside of Italy. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p> <p><strong>JD Sports</strong> said it had agreed to buy an 80 per cent stake in Deporvillage, an online-only cycling and sports equipment retailer in Catalonia, for up to €140.4m.</p> <p><strong>Lookers</strong> said its 2021 results will be significantly ahead of expectations after strong trading in May and June. The auto dealership reported continued robust consumer demand and ongoing outperformance of the UK retail new car market. Lookers also cautioned that it had delayed full-year results due on Tuesday as auditors needed “slightly more time”. Delivering results before a June 30 deadline “is still achievable, but some timing risk still exists in the completion of audit processes,” it said.</p> <p><strong>The City Pub Group</strong> said trading since reopening in April has been encouraging at&#xa0;90 per cent of 2019 levels.</p> <p>The UK audit watchdog has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c680bda1-c260-423e-80b4-fa792e14c3cd\">launched a probe</a> into the audit of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, opening a new front into the investigation of the supply chain group that collapsed in a political and financial scandal in March. The Financial Reporting Council said it had begun an investigation into Saffery Champness “in relation to its audit of the financial statements” of Greensill Capital for the year ended 2019.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority has ordered <strong>Binance</strong> to stop all regulated activities in Britain and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc0e5e0-2705-496d-a265-acccaffaee87\">imposed stringent requirements</a> on the cryptocurrency exchange. Binance said <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-27/u-k-financial-regulator-bars-crypto-exchange-binance\">on its website</a> that the move would have no direct impact.</p> <p><strong>HM Revenue &amp; Customs</strong> has launched&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ft.com/content/31fce506-e1bc-483e-8c71-bdd0ffa6ba70\">almost 13,000 investigations</a>&#xa0;into the use of government coronavirus business support schemes, including for possible fraud and other breaches of rules.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>A senior <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> official has warned the US cannot afford a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff83ed04-3bb5-444a-9af0-1b466201ef67\">boom and bust cycle</a>” in the housing market that would threaten financial stability. “It's very important for us to get back to our 2 per cent inflation target but the goal is for that to be sustainable,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed, told the FT. “And for that to be sustainable, we can't have a boom and bust cycle in something like real estate.</p> <p><strong>UBS</strong> plans to allow up to two-thirds of its staff to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1601e314-6d6d-4014-94df-f2858ee64e8e\">mix working from home and the office</a> on a permanent basis. The Swiss bank has decided that only employees whose roles required their presence in the office due to supervisory rules or to carry out specific tasks, such as traders and branch staff, would have little or no flexibility in their working practices.</p> <p><strong>Denmark's media industry</strong> is pioneering a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c83d6b7f-ed19-4a90-a719-3bf4aedccdff\">new bargaining tactic</a> with Google and Facebook over payments for news, with newspapers, broadcasters and internet start-ups joining forces to negotiate with the tech groups as a copyright collective. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong> The desire to make private-sector defined benefit pensions plans safe had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/138974df-5dc0-47e4-acb8-e2eb048fe8bd\">rendered them unaffordable</a>.&#xa0;The best has been the calamitous enemy of the good.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Hill</strong> It's time to retire the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a448798-e12c-454d-8378-360ad245dd51\">burning platform metaphor</a>. Instilling fear can break habits, but extended anxiety can also turn us into risk-averse introverts, nervous even to edge out of our narrow comfort zones.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Burberry begins CEO search after Gobbetti defects to rival' FT.com 28 June.
