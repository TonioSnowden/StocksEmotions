  "text": "<p>   Private-equity firm Thoma Bravo LP has struck a deal to buy software maker Anaplan Inc. for $10.7 billion\"\" the latest in a recent string of big leveraged buyouts. </p><p>   Under the terms of the deal,  Anaplan shareholders are to receive $66 a share. Anaplan Chief Executive Frank Calderoni plans to continue to lead the company. </p><p>   Based in San Francisco, Anaplan makes software that helps businesses plan by modeling for different forecasting outcomes. The company has more than 1,900 customers world-wide, including Coca-Cola Co., Shell PLC and VMware Inc., which use its cloud-based offering to manage  sales operations, supply chains, inventories and financial planning. </p><p>   The uncertainty created by the pandemic further fueled already-strong demand for planning software, Mr. Calderoni said. </p><p>   Shares of Anaplan, which was founded in 2006 and went public in 2018, closed at $50.59 on Friday. </p><p>   Buyout firms, flush with  piles of cash, have been on a deal-making tear. Software, with its steady cash flows, has been a hot area. </p><p>   Anaplan is among several big software companies in a take-private deal. In January, Vista Equity Partners and the private-equity arm of Elliott Management Corp. agreed to buy Citrix Systems Inc. for about $13 billion. In November, Advent International Corp. and Permira announced a $12 billion deal for McAfee Corp. Other big LBOs that have been in the works include one for TV-ratings company Nielsen Holdings PLC that could be valued at about $15 billion including debt, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   Last week, activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management LP disclosed a nearly 5% stake in Anaplan. Sachem Head is part of a group of activists that together hold an even larger stake, a filing shows. </p><p>   Thoma Bravo plans to use Anaplan as a platform for further acquisitions. </p><p></p>",
