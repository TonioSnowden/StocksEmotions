They will also sell a version with no sugar.</p><p>Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo Inc. have been expanding into alcoholic drinks.</p><p>Coke has introduced Topo Chico hard seltzer and Simply Spiked Lemonade, created in a partnership with Molson Coors Beverage Co.</p><p>Coke also made a deal with Constellation Brands Inc. to introduce a line of canned cocktails under the Fresca brand.</p><p>PepsiCo is making an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew in a partnership with Boston Beer Co. And the brewer of Bud Light is making hard seltzers with soda flavors.</p><p>The product launches are the latest in a series of crossover ventures as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another's turf in search of growth.</p><p>Consumer demand has soared over the past few years for nonalcoholic seltzers and alcoholic ones such as White Claw that are low on calories and offer just a hint of flavor. Now some consumers are migrating toward stronger flavors, industry experts say, and brewers are trying out new fizzy drinks.</p><p>Canned cocktails are a smaller but fast-growing segment, as drinkers look for a convenient way to re-create a bar experience at home or just on the go.
