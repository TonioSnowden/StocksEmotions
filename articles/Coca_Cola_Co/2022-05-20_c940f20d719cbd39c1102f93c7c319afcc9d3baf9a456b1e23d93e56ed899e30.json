  "title": "THG: higher entry prices sought from bidders",
  "text": "<p>It is not immediately clear how a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5e4e4b1-4cea-4638-89f5-5c14ba2bff5c\">£2.07bn bid</a> undervalues a company with a £1.4bn market cap. But THG, online purveyor of cosmetics and protein powders, was quick to rebuff the bid from a brace of investment firms — as it has a series of earlier “unacceptable” offers.</p> <p>The group, founded by Matthew Moulding, has long struggled with valuation dysmorphia. Investors initially proved willing enablers, accordingly the company had a market capitalisation of £5.4bn on its debut on the London stock exchange nearly two years ago.</p> <p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations using round numbers suggest 170p a share is perfectly reasonable. That would value the equity at £2.07bn, or £2.36bn on a fully diluted basis. Adding on THG's forecast net debt of about £160mn gives an enterprise value of £2.2bn or £2.5bn. Even on the undiluted share base, that gives an EV/ebitda multiple of 13.8 times, pretty much in line with the board pool of ecommerce players.</p> <p>This is not quite the company THG hopes to keep. Its much-hyped Ingenuity unit&#xa0;is designed to give it tech credentials (and multiples). But the unit, which provides a tech and logistics gateway for third parties such as Nestlé or Coca-Cola looking to sell directly to consumers, only contributed revenues of £194mn last year, or less than a tenth of group sales. SoftBank's call option to take a one-fifth stake for $1.6bn looks dead in the water.</p> <p>Aware of the prevailing winds, THG has set out steps to enhance value both operationally and in corporate governance. It has pledged to unwind an arrangement that gives Moulding a special share to veto any hostile offers.</p> <p>Bidders in the frame — at least those which have been disclosed — are a motley crew. Property tycoon Nick Candy was another early stage bidder on Thursday. Long-suffering shareholders, happy to clutch at straws, sent shares up by a quarter to 145p by lunchtime on Friday. Their real hope, presumably like that of Moulding, will be that the flurry of activity flushes out bidders with more bulked-out offers. </p><p>Source:  2022 'THG: higher entry prices sought from bidders' FT.com 20 May.
