  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: The Wrong Way to Cure Corporate Excess --- Stock buybacks and lavish executive pay make easy targets, but curbs on them can create new problems",
  "text": "<p>Sensitive to criticism that existing revenue and cost measures won't fully pay for their proposed $3.5 trillion spending plan, Congressional Democrats have their eyes on lavish executive compensation as a source of revenue. One proposal is an excise tax on companies that buy back a \"significant\" amount of their own stock. Another would target companies that pay bosses a high multiple of average employee compensation.</p><p>Huge rewards in the C-suite are hard to defend: Executives can become far richer than even the heirs of their companies' founders, sometimes retiring as billionaires through generous stock awards. The average large-company CEO has seen a 1,322% jump in pay since 1978 and makes 351 times his or her average employee's salary, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While it is hard to argue that this is fair, or even good value for money, the Democratic proposals would just create more distortions.</p><p>Stock buybacks are a sorely misunderstood punching bag. Uncommon before a rule change in 1982, they have exploded over the last couple of decades to overtake dividends as the most common way companies return money to shareholders. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid out $178 billion via buybacks in the first quarter of this year. Analysts at DataTrek Research believe they could top $1 trillion in the next 12 months. In the past decade, Apple alone has bought back $442 billion of its shares and three other American companies have repurchased more than $100 billion apiece, according to S&amp;P Global.</p><p>But a lot of criticism has been heaped on buybacks from people who get the most basic things wrong about them. For example, an incendiary article in a major magazine commenting on Apple becoming the first trillion dollar company in 2018 called the achievement a \"scam\" achieved through buybacks rather than great products like the iPhone. The writer, whose thesis was repeated elsewhere, got his math backward. Buybacks reduce the number of shares as they boost earnings per share. While this often helps to boost the share price, the same can't be said for total market capitalization. Apple might have reached the $1 trillion milestone sooner by instead hoarding cash. Meanwhile, pension and retirement accounts that hold the shares were the overwhelming beneficiaries of those buybacks, not executives.</p><p>And, in a critique of the corporate tax cuts passed during the Trump administration, Americans for Tax Fairness pointed out that much of the windfall was used for buybacks and that they \"mostly enrich the already wealthy, including CEOs, because rich people own most corporate stock.\" Well, yes, but the same could be said of any dollar of profit earned by a company. The fact that it is used to buy back stock rather than pay down borrowings, invest in a new project or go into the company's bank account makes no difference to the owner's wealth.</p><p>What does make a difference is if it is misspent. A politician would never think to tell a local restaurant owner who just had a good year to use the windfall to expand her dining room or keep the money in the bank earning peanuts instead of giving herself a raise. Using tax policy to sway that sort of a decision by big companies could lead to lousy investments.</p><p>The worst thing one can say about buybacks is that executives laden with stock options have an ulterior motive to choose them instead of dividends as a way of returning money to shareholders since it can increase the value of those options. And companies admittedly also are pretty awful at stock-market timing. For example, S&amp;P 500 companies bought back more than twice as much stock in 2020's first quarter when prices were at record highs than during the second quarter when their shares were on sale as a result of the pandemic.</p><p>Quarterly dividends tend to be a lot more stable, but not necessarily better for shareholders. A long-term owner of a company like Berkshire Hathaway, which only returns cash through buybacks, can choose to realize a profit and pay taxes only when the money is actually needed.</p><p>Capping executive pay at a certain ratio would raise problems too. Consider two similarly compensated CEOs, Daniel O'Day of Gilead Sciences and James Quincey of Coca-Cola. Mr. O'Day makes 76 times his average employee's pay while the slightly lower-paid Mr. Quincey makes 1,621 times as much, according to executive-compensation tracker Equilar. People who make and distribute soft drinks tend to earn a lot less than scientists, so the ratio is skewed, but Mr. Quincey's company earns more profit. Enforcing pay ratios would send the top executive talent to investment banks, software companies or biotech firms instead of retailers, trucking companies or restaurant chains.</p><p>Politicians wanting to raise revenue and strike a blow against wealth inequality might have found the path of least resistance by trying to do so at the expense of some of the best paid people in America, but there is a simpler way: Just raise taxes on capital gains or on high incomes even more than planned. If that proves too politically fraught, making it easier for the nearly half of Americans with no retirement savings to own stocks without 401(k) plans would help too. It also would do wonders for the American public's opinion of stock buybacks and hotshot CEOs.</p>",
