  "title": "Kellogg Raises Outlook After Quarterly Sales Rise; Food company says consumer demand held up despite raising its prices",
  "text": "<p>Kellogg's price increases, which led to its products costing nearly 14% more on average, drove the sales growth in the quarter. Consumers pulled back slightly, in part due to its lack of cereal inventory, Kellogg said, and sales volume slipped 1.5%.</p><p>\"We continue to mitigate the margin pressure created by decades high cost inflation and bottlenecks and shortages evident across the entire economy,\" said Kellogg Chief Executive Steve Cahillane.</p><p>Kellogg, like its peers Coca-Cola Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Mondelez International Inc., said that after raising its prices, shoppers so far haven't cut back much compared with previous periods of inflation. Several consumer-product and food companies have said they expect people to curb their spending more in the second half of the year.</p><p>Kellogg is in the midst of spinning off its North America cereal business and plant-based meat brands, a plan the company announced in June. Kellogg said the separation would help its cereal brands regain their footing on supermarket shelves and fuel faster growth in its stronger snack business.</p><p>Shares were about 15% higher this year through Wednesday's close, and rose 2% Thursday.</p><p>Kellogg on Thursday said its quarterly sales rose 12% on an organic basis, which strips out impacts from currency, acquisitions and divestitures.</p><p>The company raised its outlook for organic sales to grow between 7% and 8% this year, up from its previous view of about 4%. It expects its adjusted operating profit to rise between 4% and 5%, up from its previous projection of between 1% and 2%.</p><p>Kellogg said its cereal brands in North America are recovering faster than expected after production was stunted by a plant worker strike and a factory fire last year.</p><p>For the period ended July 2, Kellogg reported a decline in profit to $415 million, or 95 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, per-share earnings were $1.18. Revenue rose 9% to $3.86 billion. The results topped analyst expectations of $1.05 per-share earnings on revenue of $3.64 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com</p><p>Kellogg Raises Outlook After Quarterly Sales Rise</p>",
