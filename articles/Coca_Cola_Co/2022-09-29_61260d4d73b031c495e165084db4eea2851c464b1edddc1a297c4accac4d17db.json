  "text": "<p>On a bookshelf containing the original Hardy Boys series, a Mr. Magoo doll covers a secret button. Press the button, and the motorized bookshelf swings open to reveal a roughly 530-square-foot office where Mr. Ring worked, Mrs. Ring said.</p><p>Her husband built the secret room with \"the excitement of a little boy,\" said Mrs. Ring, 70.</p><p>Hidden rooms have been built into homes for centuries, whether for hiding valuables or avoiding persecution. But they have seen a resurgence in recent years, as examples on the internet rekindle widespread nostalgia for the amenity, said California-based architect Todd Mather, who has designed several secret doors for clients. Sometimes these concealed spaces are built for safety or aesthetics, but often it's \"just adults feeling like kids again,\" said custom-home builder Shane Harr of PureHaven Homes in Utah. \"People love the idea of a surprise, of 'Check this out!'\"</p><p>Since his death in 2018, Mr. Ring's friends have continued to come to the house and visit the secret room to remember him, his wife said. The space has a 12-foot-high ceiling with a fireplace, and glass doors leading to a private terrace that is hidden from view from the home's exterior. On the other side of the room is another secret door, this one hidden behind a motorized panel. Together, the doors cost around $200,000 at the time due to their custom carpentry and mechanization, Mrs. Ring said.</p><p>Inside the room, model airplanes hang from the ceiling, and antique advertisements cover the walls. The room is decorated with a vintage car door, old games, sports memorabilia, a jukebox and an antique Coca-Cola machine, said Mrs. Ring, who said she hasn't changed the room's décor since her husband's death.</p><p>She is now selling the roughly 13,000-square-foot house because she plans to travel more often. The property is listed for $17.995 million with Rochelle Atlas Maize of Nourmand &amp; Associates, who said secret rooms can add value to a home.</p><p>\"There's a James Bond feel to them, and they're always a conversation piece when it comes to the resale of the property,\" she said.</p><p>The pandemic left Denver residents Hunter and Sarah Ellis feeling cramped in their home, so they planned to custom-build their dream house nearby. But when a modern house came on the market in April, it offered every amenity they dreamed of and more, including a hidden speakeasy. So they abandoned their plan to build and bought it for $8 million in May.</p><p>\"The speakeasy was a cherry-on-top situation,\" said Mr. Ellis, a 40-year-old former alcohol-distribution manager, whose wife, Sarah Ellis, also 40, works in the tech industry.</p><p>With dark-red walls, the wood-paneled speakeasy is hidden behind shelving in the home gym. \"It feels like you are transported,\" said Mr. Ellis. \"You feel like you're going into the wardrobe,\" he said, referring to the C.S. Lewis novel \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\"</p><p>The previous owner, home builder Stephen Brown, said he included the speakeasy when he built the house in 2018 as a place to entertain friends. The door, disguised as shelving, cost about $2,500 to build, he said. On the other end of the hidden room, another roughly $2,500 bookshelf opens to another exit. The wood paneling came from a Chicago bar, he said, and it retains the distinctive scent of whiskey and smoke.</p><p>After about four years, Mr. Brown decided to build a new home nearby and listed the house. It was on the market for only a week before going into contract at the asking price. \"Everyone likes a secret room,\" he said. \"They're not just for kids.\"</p><p>Mr. Ellis said the reclaimed wood paneling gives the space an authentic speakeasy feel. \"It smells like it's seen some stuff—like it's been around,\" he said.</p><p>The Ellises filled the space with mementos from their grandparents, including a record player and a typewriter desk now used as a bar cart, said Mr. Ellis. The couple, who recently moved in, used the space to entertain friends over Labor Day Weekend, spending evenings talking and listening to records, he said.</p><p>When Dawn and David Solomon purchased a Chicago Victorian in 2008 for $3.8 million, they were enchanted by the home's historic character, including a hidden butler's pantry in the dining room. A coffee tycoon built the house around 1900, and the home's wood-paneled dining room has intricately carved coffee-bean details, the Solomons said.

Guests were always surprised when the secret door opened for the first time, she added.</p><p>They loved the concept so much that they added additional hidden doors throughout the house to conceal staircases and closets, at a cost of \"a couple thousand\" dollars each, said Ms. Solomon. They spent about $10,000 to create a secret reading room behind a bookcase in their then-teenage daughter's bedroom, Ms. Solomon said. Their daughter, Emma, loved the reading room so much, she wanted to sleep there. \"I couldn't get her to sleep in her bedroom,\" Ms. Solomon recalled.</p><p>She and Mr. Solomon, an investment banker who was trained as an architect, are selling the house because they moved to Florida, and because they have started another renovation project in New York, she said. The house has been on and off the market since 2020, and was last listed for $9.35 million with Tim Salm of Jameson Sotheby's International Realty.</p><p>It wasn't until after Pati Hillis and her then-husband, computer-industry pioneer Danny Hillis, bought their Encino, Calif., home for $1.8 million in 1999 that they discovered multiple hidden spaces in the house.</p><p>The roughly 10,000-square-foot home was built around 1934, said Ms. Hillis, 67. After moving in, they found that a wet bar in the billiards room can be concealed by pulling down a special set of wooden panels that appear to be part of the wall. The hidden panels, which she believes are original to the house, ascend and descend through the ceiling into the attic above on a counterbalanced weights and pulley system.</p><p>After discovering the bar's hidden panels, they found several concealed storage spaces in the walls, and a bookshelf that pulls open to reveal a hidden closet, she said.</p><p>\"Once we discovered the bar, nobody left until we had searched every inch of the house for more hidden panels,\" she said. \"It was really exciting.\"</p><p>Construction on the house started during Prohibition, which could have been the reason for the secret spaces, said Ms. Hillis.</p><p>Ms. Hillis said she enjoyed entertaining in the billiards room, where guests would tend bar and play pool on an antique 1920s Brunswick pool table. \"People loved coming to that house,\" said Ms. Hillis.</p><p>She is selling the home now that she has moved to a roughly 18-acre ranch in Topanga Canyon, listing it for $34.9 million with Gwen Banta of Sotheby's International Realty. But the Encino home's hidden spaces have inspired a new generation of playful amenities: Ms. Hillis plans to include a secret wine cellar, card room and safe room in another house she is renovating for her recently founded home-flipping business.</p><p>\"People get a kick out of it,\" she said. \"Most houses being built today are fairly similar to each other.\"</p><p>During early Covid lockdowns, Ginny Becker, 42, and her husband, real-estate developer Billy Becker, 43, were searching for a larger home in Montgomery County, Md. While visiting a roughly 14,750-square-foot house, they were \"sold\" when they saw a secret panel leading to a wine cellar, said Ms. Becker. In May 2020, they bought the property for $3.5 million.</p><p>Located in the library, the concealed door opens to a staircase lined with bookshelves. The stairway leads to a dimly lighted, stone wine cellar with an iron door and a tasting area.</p><p>The home's first owner, the late John Jaeger, came up with the idea for the secret room, said Brendan O'Neill, who built the home for Mr. Jaeger in 1998. \"He wanted it to be as rustic as possible and to re-create something that looked like it was a wine cellar from a castle or catacomb,\" said Mr. O'Neill. \"One might envision some monks in there with grog or ale.\"</p><p>The Beckers used the space for entertaining and, on one occasion, a murder mystery-themed birthday party for Ms. Becker.</p><p>\"It was hilarious and so fun,\" said Ms. Becker. \"Someone 'died' in the billiards room, and Billy 'died' in the library just after the cake was served. The murderer must have escaped via the hidden staircase.\"</p><p>Their four children liked to play in the cellar, pretending the iron bars were a jail cell, she said.</p><p>The family has moved to Florida, so the house is listed for $6.8 million with Mr. Becker's brother, Carl Becker of Premier Properties.</p><p>Write to Sarah Paynter at Sarah.paynter@wsj.com</p><p>It's No Secret: Hidden Rooms Make Homeowners Feel Like Kids Again</p>",
