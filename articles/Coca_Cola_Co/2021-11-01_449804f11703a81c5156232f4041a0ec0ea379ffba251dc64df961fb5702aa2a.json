  "title": "Dow clings to gain after briefly topping 36,000 as investors await this week's Fed meeting",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 55.70 points, or 0.2%, to 35,875.26. The blue-chip gauge traded as high as 36,009.74, topping the 36,000 milestone for the first time.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 1.92 points, or less than 0.1%, at 4,603.46 after trading at a record intraday peak.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 35.51 points, or 0.2%, to 15,533.90, also hitting an intraday record.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all closed at records. Last month's 7% rise for the S&amp;P 500 was the best since November 2020, after the U.S. election and Pfizer's announcement of the results of a study into its COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>The backdrop for the stock market's gains have been impressive earnings. According to Credit Suisse, earnings by S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten estimates by 10% in the third quarter.</p><p>“Earnings have been more positive than feared early in the month, which we believe broadly explains the positive move in equities this month, but upside is clearly less than the prior three quarters,” said Tavis C. McCourt, strategist at Raymond James, in a note.</p><p>McCourt noted that in the three previous quarters, 2021 consensus earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 was boosted by around $10 each earnings season. This season is on track for a rise of around $3 to $4, taking from roughly $199 to $203 a share. “That is still very strong historically, but it also shows the meaningful sting of supply-chain shortages,” he said.</p><p>Earnings growth was bound to slow as the economic restart ran its course, wrote strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note.</p><p>“We still see above-trend U.S. earnings growth even as its pace is moderating as the restart runs its course,” they said. “The broadening restart and low real rates support our tactical pro-risk view. We prefer European equities where the earnings restart bump is catching up to the U.S. Within the U.S. we prefer quality shares.”</p><p>Investors will have plenty of results to sift through again this week, with 167 S&amp;P 500 companies expected to report, a similar number to last week as the peak of earnings season continues. Among the highlights will be results from drugmakers Pfizer Inc.PFE and Moderna Inc. MRNA.</p><p>Earnings Watch:How much is Big Pharma making from COVID-19 vaccines?

The motorcycle maker was facing a European retaliatory tariff of 56%.</p><p>McKesson Corp.MCK said it would sell its U.K. businesses, including LloydsPharmacy, LloydsDirect, AAH Pharmaceuticals, LloydsPharmacy Clinical Homecare, LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor, MASTA and John Bell &amp; Croyden, to asset management group Aurelius.
