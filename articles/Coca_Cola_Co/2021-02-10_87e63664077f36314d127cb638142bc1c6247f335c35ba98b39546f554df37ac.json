But new data today showed core <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51185dec-24e1-3299-ba80-7c3d2c612bdc#post-60564\">consumer prices</a> remained unchanged in January for the second month in a row.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic there was some more decisive news as the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210204IPR97105/parliament-gives-go-ahead-to-EU672-5-billion-recovery-and-resilience-facility\">European Parliament</a> gave the go-ahead to the EU's “Recovery and Resilience Facility”, the main chunk of its €750bn coronavirus recovery package, offering a mix of grants and loans to member states. This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c2007d9-6ce9-4895-ac5c-cd17e3bf69b2\">Big Read</a> examines how countries such as Italy plan to spend the EU recovery money.&#xa0;</p> <p>The global economy remains in a fragile state, says chief economics commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a14399fc-49c0-4e29-8354-54f9a0b9a895\">Martin Wolf</a>, and has “long economic Covid” and a “decade of disappointment” to look forward to, unless it acts more firmly to stamp out the virus.</p> <p>Vaccinating the world is the key, he argues, but this has been hampered by lack of action by rich countries to help their poorer counterparts, exemplified by the underwhelming response to the WHO's Covax scheme to ensure developing countries get their fair share of vaccines.</p> <p>There was some good vaccine news today, however: BioNTech/Pfizer said its coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb311423-dd2f-48f8-af57-8d8f0103c313\">vaccine</a> offered two-thirds protection after just one shot. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef9a2d0-0c18-4c0f-947b-4ef53a4e9806\">Global stocks</a> hit a record high after the announcement. </p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>Manufacturing and construction are powering <strong>China's economic recovery</strong>, according to new data that show the price of goods leaving the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ddd478f-c1c6-4b75-8eaa-cdbfe0585f54\">factories</a> rose for the first time since the start of the pandemic as the cost of raw materials increased. Exports have also enjoyed strong growth.</p> <p><strong>UK retail sales</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e69547f9-904b-4306-bf0b-9ed90393658c\">consumer spending</a> in the UK have been hit by the current lockdown, despite a big rise in online transactions. Government ministers have ditched plans to announce a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/013ce682-09c8-4132-9a14-232f7e9f311a\">industrial strategy</a> in favour of a post-pandemic “plan for growth” led by the Treasury. The regions are feeling the squeeze: at least 12 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/600882a5-51cd-43bb-8f6f-c8283b4a7000\">English councils</a> are in rescue talks as the pandemic devastates revenues. </p> <p>Global economic recovery faces a new threat from a plunge in <strong>skilled migration</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/146fbb75-8a66-4b41-90a3-e986da2b6505\">OECD</a> said. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand that did well in containing coronavirus have lost up to 80 per cent of their normal inward flows. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Heineken</strong>, the world's second-largest brewer, is cutting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f060d32-f93c-4702-a0bc-9228ff2a3912\">8,000 jobs</a> — 10 per cent of its workforce — after reporting a net loss of €204m for the year as lockdown closures of bars dented its revenues. Fewer than 30 per cent of bars and restaurants were operating in Europe by the end of January. <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> reported a similar story: these outlets normally account for half its annual <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0df6b673-29ac-4af5-bd25-ac7c81c70b9e\">sales</a>.</p> <p>The UK has four companies involved in <strong>making vaccines</strong> and two rapid response centres under construction. This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/662ab296-2aef-4179-907c-5dba5c355d86\">story</a> shows how government support for a vaccines task force helped Britain expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity with hopes of attracting pharma companies back to the country. </p> <p><strong>Tourism in Spain </strong>— which normally accounts for 12 per cent of GDP and 13 per cent of employment — has been battered by the pandemic. The loss of a second consecutive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db3f8536-a6be-456e-816e-5879b5916ca2\">holiday season</a> could mean many more hotels joining the 500 already shut over the past year. <strong>Tui</strong>, Europe's largest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50ae0452-c4bc-456c-8d49-8aa9daacd6cf\">tour operator</a>, was more optimistic, believing the introduction of vaccines would enable it to run 80 per cent of its normal programme this year. </p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>Markets for <strong>raw materials</strong> could be on the brink of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27086ad8-bc84-4e2e-9195-91880fa6916f\">“supercycle”</a> as prices jump at the prospect of a stimulus-driven economic recovery. Gains for commodities, out of fashion with investors for almost a decade, have been spurred by demand from China — the world's biggest buyer of natural resources — and have included jumps in prices for soyabeans, copper and oil. <em>This article is part of our</em><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/runawaymarkets\"><em> Runaway Markets series.</em></a></p> <p><strong>Europe's debt markets</strong> are feeling the benefit of EU recovery programmes. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ac65419-76a2-4269-aa84-912378e03cd1\">Spain</a> has reaped more than €65bn in orders for a new 50-year bond while borrowing costs in Italy have hit new lows. “From a borrower's perspective . . . subdued European government bond yields, along with generally historically flat curves, have made issuance activity at the extra-long end particularly attractive,” said UniCredit, the Italian bank. </p> <p>The market for <strong>US</strong> <strong>car loans</strong> is another that has done well during the pandemic, with the prices of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08cb9538-f113-4eec-8ea7-b76c27ca3d4a\">bonds</a> backed by the loans hitting new highs. Retail demand for new and used cars has remained strong, although some carmakers such as <strong>General Motors </strong>have been hit by the pandemic-fuelled shortage of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7348d241-2f5d-4354-b927-4c13b9a75557\">semiconductors</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aff7fa78-2793-4ee0-86c6-ce98186331c1\">Japanese</a> manufacturers such as <strong>Toyota</strong> have been less affected by the dearth of chips.</p> <h1>The essentials</h1> <p>Should Britons give up on hopes for a summer holiday following strong negative signals from ministers? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a649908d-fed4-4d15-a176-20e938bbf2ad\">Read our Q&amp;A</a>. </p> <p>Many of us have made the switch from office to home, but what about those younger workers for whom <strong>remote working</strong> is all they know? Unless businesses address mental health problems caused by isolation and “hyper-connectedness”, writes author Elizabeth Uviebinené, “we will be sleepwalking into a post-pandemic culture of absenteeism, high staff turnover and lowered productivity”. <a href=\"https://futureworkforce.live.ft.com/home\"><em>Register here</em></a><em> for the FT conference on the future of work on March 9.</em></p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>Trotters Up comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9de71d6-01c8-4de9-80ee-2c756f2f2e99?commentID=32a09dab-ded0-4d78-87bb-071675004bef\">Making a good job of remote work</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“For homeworking, see an exaggeration of the previous decade's experience with outsourcing. The reality is often different to the theory, which means both positives and negatives need to be addressed realistically with an open mind. A cost is still a cost whether it is hidden or accepted from the start.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Gyms may be closed but we have plenty of recommendations for keeping body and mind healthy during the dark days of lockdown.
