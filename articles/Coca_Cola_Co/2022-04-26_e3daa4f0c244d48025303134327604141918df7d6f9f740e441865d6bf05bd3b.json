  "text": "<p>PepsiCo has taken almost $500mn of charges related to the impact of Russia's war against Ukraine on its drinks and snacks business in the region, reflecting the conflict's rising costs to western brands that had seen eastern Europe as a growth market.</p> <p>The New York-based consumer goods group announced in March that it would suspend sales of brands including Pepsi and 7Up in Russia, while maintaining that it had a humanitarian responsibility to continue offering products including milk and baby food in Russia, where it has 20,000 employees. </p> <p>It told investors on Tuesday it would take $241mn in “brand portfolio impairment charges” and a separate $241mn in “Russia-Ukraine conflict charges”, relating to its need to write off receivables and the value of some inventory in the region. </p> <p>The $482mn total is one of the largest announced by a US company. GE on Tuesday announced $230mn in charges relating to its businesses in Russia and Ukraine. </p> <p>There has been growing pressure on western brands to pull out of Russia completely as the conflict has worsened. However, Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, said there had been “no change in our thinking” since March and that the company had not set a deadline for reviewing its longer-term presence in Russia. </p> <p>Despite the charges, PepsiCo boosted its sales outlook for 2022, although it warned that a strong dollar would result in a higher currency translation “headwind” to earnings expectations. </p> <p>The maker of Gatorade and Lay's now expects full-year revenue to increase by 8 per cent in 2022 on an organic basis, which adjusts for acquisitions, divestitures and currency impacts. The company had previously guided to organic revenue growth of 6 per cent.</p> <p>The updated outlook came despite higher than expected inflation in commodities, energy prices and other input costs which Ramon Laguarta, chief executive, said would last “for the balance of 2022”.</p> <p>Analysts welcomed better than expected organic sales growth of 13.7 per cent, which drove a 7 per cent rise in its core measure of earnings per share to $1.29, above Wall Street's $1.23 forecast. </p> <p>PepsiCo's updated revenue guidance contrasted with rival Coca-Cola's reaffirmation of its 2022 outlook on Monday, despite reporting its highest quarterly revenue and profit since 2016.</p> <p>Coca-Cola said on Monday the suspension of its business in Russia would shave 1 per cent off global case volumes and 4 cents from its 2022 forecast for adjusted earnings per share, but did not go as far as announcing any impairment charges.</p> <p>PepsiCo confirmed most of its other full-year guidance but warned of a 2 percentage point foreign exchange translation headwind, up from its February forecast of 1.5 percentage points. This implied its core measure of earnings would come in at $6.63 a share in 2022, 6 per cent above 2021 but 4 cents lower than a previous forecast.</p> <p>Overall, PepsiCo said revenues had risen 9.3 per cent to $16.2bn in its first quarter compared with a year earlier, while net income was up almost 150 per cent to $4.26bn.</p> <p>Johnston said new products including Pepsi Nitro and Ruffles Flamin' Hot Cheddar &amp; Sour Cream were driving the growth, and noted that consumers were adopting zero sugar products at an accelerated rate.</p> <p>The group was encountering little resistance from consumers where it had raised prices in response to inflation, he said, but was looking for “several hundred million dollars” more in cost savings to offset the need for further price increases, he added.</p><p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Peter Wells 2022 'PepsiCo takes almost $500mn charge related to Russia-Ukraine war' FT.com 26 April.
