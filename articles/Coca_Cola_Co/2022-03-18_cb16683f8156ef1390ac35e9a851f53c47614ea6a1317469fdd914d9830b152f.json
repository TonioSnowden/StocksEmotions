  "title": "Lifelong Friendships Began at the Malt Shop  ----  By Angela Rocco DeCarlo",
  "text": "<p>   It was the quintessential teen malt shop of the 1950s, with soda fountain, green wooden booths, wall-hung mini jukeboxes and wall-to-wall teens. We called it Tom's because that was the man's name. We never noticed the neon sign in the window that said \"Town Candy Shop.\" I never knew anyone who bought the store-made chocolates. It was where we went for a dime Coke and to see and be seen. </p><p>   Grey-haired Tom presided over the place in a silent, benevolent manner. It was up to his son, John -- smiling, rotund John -- to keep order: \"No standing in the aisles.\" \"Sit or go!\" \"No dancing, you might step on the cat.\" </p><p>   For more than 30 years Tom's was the clubhouse to the Italians from the Chicago neighborhood known as \"The Island,\" the Irish from Oak Park, the Czechs from Cicero and the Dutch from Berwyn. It was the Woodstock of the '50s for the teens who lived around 12th Street and Austin Boulevard, the juncture of Chicago and those three suburbs. There were never any confrontations or hassling of the girls. Known older brothers instilled decorum in the ragtag boys. </p><p>   We didn't know we were already an anachronism -- walkers in an age of wheels. The car lines on North Avenue on Saturday night stretched endlessly to get into Skip's Drive-In. We were content with Tom's and our gang of neighborhood boys, the last of whom died last month. </p><p>   Six girls lived on Monitor Avenue, and we formed a club. We wanted to call ourselves the Amboy Dukettes after the boys in \"City Across the River\" (1949), the racy movie that introduced gorgeous Tony Curtis. Our mothers wouldn't hear of it. So we became \"The Six Steps\" as we came in graduated heights. We bought matching black wool jackets and wore them everywhere, even to my grandmother's wake. (One of my three sons later wore mine at his baseball games.) </p><p>   Then we heard Tom died and John married and moved out West -- whether that meant a Chicago suburb or California we never knew. </p><p>   Eventually the Six Steps got wheels and moved to the suburbs, where we adopted new personas as wives, mothers, PTA workers and career women but still managed to meet, as a club, once a month for fun. We promised not to age beyond 15. We couldn't manage that, so we settled for 19. Yet one of us celebrating a big birthday insisted she was 13 and even received cards with that lucky number. </p><p>   At this stage in life, it seems that those of us -- like the Six Steps -- who keep life-long friends have won the lottery of life. We have friends who knew us when we were 13, and to them we will never really be old. It is a source of joy and comfort. One of the Six Steps died two years ago, but some of her fellow club members attended her great-grandson's first birthday party. That's what friends do. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. DeCarlo is a former Chicago journalist now living in Southern California. </p><p></p>",
