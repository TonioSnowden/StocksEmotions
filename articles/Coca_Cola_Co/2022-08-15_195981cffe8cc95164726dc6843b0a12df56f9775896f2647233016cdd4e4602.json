  "title": "Paintings by college-age Andy Warhol put on auction block by Warhola family; The 10 pieces were created by Warhol — né Warhola — while he was a student at what is now Carnegie-Mellon in Pittsburgh, the artist's hometown",
  "text": "<p>Warhol (born Andrew Warhola Jr. ) left Pittsburgh for New York in 1949 and worked as a commercial artist for nearly a decade. He rose to international fame as a leading figure in the visual art movement known as Pop art in the 1960s with his iconic paintings of everyday objects, such as Campbell's soup cans CPB, Coca-Cola bottles KO and Brillo boxes, in addition to bold and vibrant portraits of celebrities.</p><p>See: Have a spare $200 million? You might be able to buy this Andy Warhol portrait of Marilyn Monroe</p><p>Also: Andy Warhol's iconic Marilyn Monroe portrait sells for record $195 million</p><p>In May, Warhol's 1964 portrait of actress Marilyn Monroe sold for US$195 million at a Christie's auction in New York, making it the most expensive American artwork sold at auction and the second-most expensive auctioned piece of art, trailing only Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvator Mundi,\" which sold for $450 million in 2017 at Christie's.</p><p>\"It's hard to believe the portrait of Marilyn Monroe, painted in his studio where I often visited, became the most paid-for American painting,\" Warhola says. \"With the imagination my uncle captured, it made our decision to move on with selling our family collection much easier.\"</p><p>Warhola and his six siblings have been planning to sell the group of 10 paintings since their parents died several years ago. After Warhol left Pittsburgh, the paintings were taken care of by their father Paul, the oldest of Warhol's brothers.</p><p>\"My father had loaned the paintings to museums, so the public was able to see them,\" he says.</p><p>The paintings were included in a recently concluded international traveling exhibition, \"Andy Warhol: Lifetimes,\" with stops at the Tate Modern in London, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the Art Gallery of Toronto and the Aspen Art Museum.</p><p>Warhola says he is currently in talks with major auction houses to sell two of the paintings this November, with plans to sell two-to-three paintings during the spring and fall seasons next year.</p><p>\"It is not easy to value his works from this period, we'll see where the market falls,\" Warhola says.</p><p>From the archives (December 2021): Andy Warhol NFTs?
