  "text": "<p>Over the past year, I've noticed more and more of my friends, family and colleagues cutting back on the booze. Or even giving it up altogether. Hell, even I'm drinking less these days and writing about alcohol is my job. </p> <p>This month an estimated 60,000 Brits will give up drinking for <a href=\"https://www.gosober.org.uk/\">Sober October</a>, Macmillan Cancer Support's fundraiser. About a fifth of UK adults say they don't drink alcohol at all, and among 16-to-24-year-olds it's almost a quarter. </p> <p>People's reasons for abstaining are various: generational, constitutional, cultural, religious. For me it's simply a case of hitting 45, having a full-time job and children, and realising I no longer have the stamina to start the day fizzy-eyed. </p> <p>It's a trend that is changing the social landscape. And it's changing the restaurant industry too. Where once non-alcoholic drinks menus were the preserve of outliers such as Noma, they're becoming a commercial — and creative — necessity for any serious restaurant. And, in the best cases, the results are extremely exciting. </p> <p>Don't believe me? Then let's go straight in at the deep end with the fermented black garlic juice at Mãos in London's Shoreditch. Until I put this treacle-coloured beverage in my mouth, I could have hardly believed that a drink made from such a pungent plant could taste so good. The aroma was sticky-sweet garlic, but the flavour was almost like a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c294275-84e4-4362-b61b-f3a82db59183\">madeira</a>, with a warm nutmeggy spice. Chef Edoardo Pellicano serves it in a wine glass with a morsel of inky cuttlefish, but it would also be delicious with vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>Coming in at well below 1 per cent alcohol by volume (less than some loaves of bread), that drink is part of a six-course “soft pairing” that includes a ferment of Korean green plums and shiso, a tart red berry juice spiked with Szechuan pepper, and a burnt orange kombucha made from bittersweet blood oranges and smoky lapsang souchong tea that's as aromatic and textured as an orange wine. </p> <p>“I noticed a lot more guests were choosing not to drink and I thought: this is an area where we can really elevate the restaurant,” says Pellicano, who has one chef dedicated to preparing&#xa0;ferments, juices and brews. “They are almost like dishes in themselves.”</p> <p>The supplement for the six-course soft pairing is £95 a head (compared with £125 for the wine pairing), a price that some may baulk at. But these drinks aren't sorry little substitutes for alcohol, they're another taste experience entirely. And one that had my (completely clear) head popping with curiosity and pleasure. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98ac6614-72b4-11e5-bdb1-e6e4767162cc\">The Clove Club</a>, which&#xa0;features on the World's 50 Best list, has long been a champion of non-alc pairings. “There are whole cultures that manage to eat, drink and celebrate without alcohol, and we often look to them for inspiration,” says bar manager Rob Simpson. “We serve a lot of tea, for example, a drink which has as much flavour, history, culture and terroir to it as wine, and which also pairs brilliantly with food.”</p> <p>Just because a drink is soft, doesn't mean it has to be sweet. One of the most popular non-alc pairings on The Clove Club's eight-course tasting menu is baked aubergine and green tomato with a “tea” of dried morels, juniper berries, sugar kelp and lemon peel. The sweet-and-savoury apple and white miso soda that comes with the sea bass is also very good. </p> <p>“When we first started offering the non-alc menu five years ago, we sold maybe one a week,” says Simpson. “Now it's three or four every service [of about 45 diners], plus another three or four people having the pairing that's half-and-half alcohol and non.”</p> <p>For the owners of Sheffield's acclaimed restaurant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cec23422-f821-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c\">Joro</a>, it was their own decision to go sober post-lockdown that galvanised them to rethink their drinks menu. “You can't say we do an amazing food offering and an amazing wine list and some great beers, and then tell someone who's not drinking: ‘You can have tonic, mineral water or Coke',” says Stacey French. “It's about making everyone, whatever their reasons for not drinking, feel welcomed and looked after.”</p> <p>Joro's five-course non-alc menu has teas, tangy shrubs and twists on Asian specialities such as the Japanese fermented rice drink <em>amazake</em>. “We also love L'Antidote, which is a sparkling blend of gamay grape juice and botanicals from a wine grower in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2c7bbe4-9227-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2\">Beaujolais</a>,” says Luke French. </p> <p>Northumberland's Scandi sensation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/201c44f8-04bc-4536-9d34-389e3a7f038d\">Hjem</a> makes an array of non-alc drinks in collaboration with local producers and using local ingredients. One of its signature drinks is apple &amp; hay, made by steeping hay from the field opposite with the restaurant's own apple juice. “I like to serve it where I might serve, say, a skin-contact Chenin from the Loire,” says sommelier Anna Frost. “It goes really well with lobster and scallop.”</p> <p>Frost has also put together a great selection of no-and-lo options from around Europe: Passing Clouds (less than 0.5 per cent abv), a sparkling ferment of white currants, jasmine tea, quince and geranium created by Danish drinksmiths Muri; and Ama Bat (1.5 per cent abv),&#xa0;an umami-ish bottle-aged kombucha born in San Sebastián's two-Michelin-star restaurant Mugaritz.</p> <p>Zero-abv beers are also an important part of the repertoire, says Frost: the flavoursome non-alc brews by the Danish Mikkeller are a particular favourite. </p> <p>A tasting menu can be a marathon at the best of times. Throw in a wine match with every course and it can be downright gruelling. I'm not sure I'd have made it to the end of the two-star tasting menu at James Knappett's 16-seater Fitzrovia restaurant Kitchen Table had I gone with the full wine pairing. </p> <p>So after a glass of JM Sélèque Solessence Extra Brut from sommelier Sandia Chang's excellent grower champagne list, I opted for the new non-alc pairing menu. The best recipes were a delight. The strawberry and fig leaf aperitif — bursting with green and fruity perfume, but none of the sweetness — was a dazzling partner for an amuse-bouche of oyster topped with gooseberry and apple snow. Oak-aged pear juice, served in a brandy balloon, brought mellow sweetness to a sticky onion tarte Tatin topped with Dorstone goat's cheese. My favourite, though, was a fusion of cherry stone, leaf and blossoms that was as crisp as a cold rosé. I could drink that all night. </p> <p>Which is not to say I'm giving up alcohol just yet. But with drinks like these, choosing the soft option is now a little less hard. </p> <h2>Sparkling jasmine</h2> <p>Rob Simpson, The Clove Club</p> <p>We serve a lot of teas from Postcard Teas. This incredibly simple but delicious recipe is from&#xa0;<em>Easy Leaf Tea</em>&#xa0;by Postcard Tea's founder Timothy d'Offay.</p> <p>Infusing the tea gently in cold water creates a much more delicate, fragrant flavour. It's a nice non-alcoholic alternative to champagne — try it with a sea bass crudo. </p> <p>4-5 servings</p> <ol>  <li><p>Decant 50ml of the sparkling water and then add the tea to the remaining water. Screw the top back on and store upright in the fridge for 3-4 hours. </p></li>  <li><p>When the time comes to serve, strain through a fine strainer into flutes.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Green tea &amp; apple</h2> <p>Oliver Kaviani, Joro</p> <p>Instead of cold-infusing tea in water, try adding tea to your favourite juice — the combinations are endless. The fresher the juice, the better. This combination works really well with seafood dishes, especially scallops, or fresh vegetables and salads. The grassiness in the tea adds a lovely complexity and tannin to the apple. </p> <p>2 servings</p> <ol>  <li><p>Combine the juice and tea in a jug and leave to infuse for a few hours or overnight. </p></li>  <li><p>Strain and serve chilled (I tend not to add ice).</p></li> </ol> <h2>Spicy grapefruit ‘Margarita'</h2> <p>Sandia Chang, Kitchen Table</p> <p>This recipe is inspired by one of my favourite cocktails from a bar in New York called Barrio Chino. Excellent with nachos!</p> <p>1 serving</p> <ol>  <li><p>Shake the grapefruit juice, jalapeños and lime juice (and optional sugar syrup) with ice. </p></li>  <li><p>Salt the rim of a rocks glass, fill with ice and then strain the drink into the glass.</p></li>  <li><p>Top with a splash of soda water and a mint sprig.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Plum &amp; thyme</h2> <p>Anna Frost, Hjem</p> <p>This is a simplified version of a juice we currently have on the menu at Hjem. We serve it with chicken liver parfait and venison tartare. It pairs really well with terrines, pâtés, and sourdough bread or game dishes. If your juice turns out quite strong and sweet, match it with strong cheeses and charcuterie. It's also great with dark rum. </p> <p>6-8 servings</p> <ol>  <li><p>Simmer the plums very, very gently for 20-25 minutes. </p></li>  <li><p>Strain the liquid through a muslin, add some sprigs of thyme and leave to cool. Strain again. </p></li>  <li><p>Sweeten with a little more sugar or dilute with a little water if required. </p></li>  <li><p>Serve warm or cold. Stored in the fridge it will keep for up to a week. (You can eat the plums with some caster sugar and crème fraîche if you like).</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Alice Lascelles is an FT contributing editor and writes the drinks column for FT How To Spend It.
