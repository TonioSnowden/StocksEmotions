  "text": "<p><em>Good morning. Today we are covering a fresh warning from the Biden administration about Russian troop movements and the NFL's racism problem. But first a look at how Wall Street's top regulator is bolstering the rules around disclosure.</em></p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking to compel hedge funds and private equity groups to disclose quarterly performance and fees charged to investors as the agency pushes back against activities it warned were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb097f8-41bd-41c9-916e-713ea4035d8d\">“contrary to the public interest”</a>. </p> <p>The proposals would require registered private fund advisers to share quarterly statements with investors including detailed records of all fees and expenses — a point of contention in the industry — as well as performance.</p> <p>The strengthened regulation is aimed at protecting investors after hedge funds, private equity groups and venture capital funds amassed more than $18tn in gross assets, the SEC said.</p> <p>The proposals also come at a time when big investors such as pension funds and endowments are racing into alternative assets — including real estate and infrastructure — as the outlook for returns in public markets dims.</p> <p>The moves are among the strongest changes to oversight of the fast-growing private financial markets since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act a decade ago.</p> <p>Gary Gensler, SEC chair, said after the regulator had voted on the proposals: “Private fund advisers, through the funds they manage, touch so much of our economy. Thus, it's worth asking whether we can promote more efficiency, competition and transparency in this field.”</p> <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> The changes will shine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ead993e0-fa67-484d-9b60-f87e37bea3c1\">a much needed light</a> on to an increasingly important but opaque area of financial markets, the FT said in an editorial. </p> <p><em>Thanks all our readers who voted in yesterday's poll and for sending in your comments. I will feature some of them in tomorrow's email — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
