  "text": "<p>There is, in my opinion, no mountain location more inspiring than the French town of Chamonix, which perhaps explains why, a year after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ace9f2b-70aa-48e9-8ad6-3eada2f5e698\">following the world's best ultra-runners around the Alps' highest peak</a> as a spectator, I found myself back at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc for my own 100km race.</p> <p>Interest in ultra-running — typically defined as any foot race longer than 50km — has boomed in the past decade and the UTMB has become the de facto world championships. Founded in 2003, initially as a 106-mile (171km) race around Mont Blanc, the event has expanded into a week-long festival that attracts major sponsors and some 10,000 runners to eight different races, now broadcast to millions of fans around the world.</p> <p>Ultra-running, by any definition, is a strange endeavour and the mountain variety can seem particularly cruel. My race, the CCC, is equivalent to almost two and half marathons and includes 6,100 metres of lung-busting ascent over perilous Alpine passes.</p> <p>Launched in 2006 as a shorter version of the original UTMB, which normally takes place the following day, the CCC has evolved into one of the sport's most prestigious races in its own right — a sought-after challenge for ultra-runners around the world who complete gruelling qualifying races then enter a lottery to secure a coveted place.</p> <p>The result this year, at 9am on the last Friday in August, was a sea of almost 2,000 skinny runners in the latest ultra-trail fashion — psychedelic caps, skin-tight race packs and futuristic shoes — squeezed on to a tree-lined avenue in the picturesque Italian ski-town of Courmayeur.</p> <p>The name comes from the three mountain towns the race connects — Courmayeur in Italy, then Champex in Switzerland and finally Chamonix in France. Locals describe the CCC as a “half-turn” around the famous mountain. The fastest runner, a 28-year-old, Red Bull-sponsored Swede called Petter Engdahl, would complete the course in a record-breaking nine hours and 53 minutes. For most it would take more than double that. </p> <p>Classical music filled the air as the organisers counted us down. Then we were off: a rabble of runners from 83 countries winding through the town's narrow streets like a herd of colourful wild horses.</p> <p>As to why people would choose to run through the mountains for a hundred kilometres only to emerge at the finish, almost a day later, hungry and broken, I still can't be sure. In Christopher McDougall's best-selling 2009 book, <em>Born to Run,</em> he argued that the ability to run long distances was a defining characteristic of human evolution. At moments during the CCC, I could see his point.</p> <p>Leaving Courmayeur at the front of my wave of runners, I felt euphoric. The town's pretty streets turned into a stony track and then a series of narrow switchbacks, climbing more than 1,000 metres over a handful of kilometres to the first pass, the Tête de La Tronche, at around 2,500 metres above sea level.</p> <p>At the top I looked back to see a trail of runners zigzagging up the mountain from the valley bottom, united in their mad goal.</p> <p>As the race wore on though, over another five major climbs, through stunning Swiss villages and into the dark hours of the night, the moments of euphoria became rarer and the suffering set in.</p> <p>I made mental notes as I ran to remember the highs: the taste of cool spring water in a tiny hamlet on the descent from the 2,537-metre Grand Col Ferret; the sight of a majestic wooden cross in a hillside clearing just after halfway; the joyous French family with a Dalmatian dog who cheered me into the penultimate aid station around midnight.</p> <p>The lows were easier to recall: a gruelling 700-metre ascent to the Switzerland-France border after 70km when we had already climbed more than 4,000 metres; the grit that embedded in my elbow after I clipped my tired feet on broken ground and fell for the first time; the guttural sound of an exhausted runner groaning in the darkness.</p> <p>In the first half of the race I checked my watch regularly and quietly celebrated if I passed another runner. In the second half, kilometres and position faded into irrelevance and I focused only on the hypnotic rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other.</p> <p>They say ultra-running is as much an eating challenge as a running one as you try to replace the calories you have burnt. At each aid station — seven in total — I refilled my water bottles and plundered the platters of salami, cheese, fruit and chocolate laid out by volunteers. The plain penne pasta served up at the halfway point tasted heavenly. Coca-Cola developed a new revitalising power.</p> <p>When the light failed and the head torches came on, I had been running for 12 hours and the race entered its most surreal phase. Descending in darkness to the Swiss town of Trient, the forest seemed to come alive: shadows moved like people, trees morphed into animals.</p> <p>By now the aid stations looked like triage tents in a war zone, where zombie runners tended to injured feet and crammed morsels of food into hungry mouths.</p> <p>On the final climb, rising 600 metres up yet another series of switchbacks to a plateau north of the finish, I saw little other than the square metre in front of my feet. Hunched over my hiking poles, I watched the beetles and earwigs scurrying beneath me as I climbed up and up. </p> <p>Then suddenly, there it was: the bright lights of Chamonix stretched out on the valley floor.</p> <p>I was still more than an hour from the end but I now felt lighter as I raced across the rocks under a starry sky. The first metres of the descent on battered legs were excruciating, but as I got closer the pain of 100km ebbed away and before long I was flying through the town. I crossed the line at around 3am after 17 hours and 45 minutes, 476th out of 1,727 runners.</p> <p>Did I enjoy it? That is difficult to answer. Would I do it again? Definitely.</p> <p><em>Tom Wilson is the FT's acting senior energy correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Tom Wilson 2022 'My 100km race around Mont Blanc' FT.com 8 September.
