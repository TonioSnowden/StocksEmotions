  "title": "Ai Weiwei at Kettle's Yard — a story of faith and fakes",
  "text": "<p>The idea that we might trust an artwork seems strange. But what if I were to tell you that your favourite piece — a Gauguin in a museum, or a performance of a Rachmaninov piano concerto, say — was a fake? That the painting was actually a forgery, or the recording was a hoax (indeed, both have actually happened). Would you be able to see it or hear it in the same way? Or would you feel something akin to betrayal? </p> <p>At Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the city that became a home for Ai Weiwei in 2018 following his self-imposed exile from China, the dissident artist has filled the galleries with an assortment of Chinese antiquities alongside his own artworks that either ape or playfully vandalise ancient masterpieces, as well as outright fakes, for his exhibition <em>The Liberty of Doubt</em>. The story they tell us has a lot to say about how we approach art.</p> <p>The mass desecration of China's heritage under the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s was traumatic for many. But that frenzy of iconoclasm was followed by a mania for the distant past. In the 1990s, Ai spent his days wandering Beijing's antique markets, developing a taste for ancient artefacts. In a triptych of now infamous photographs, he recorded himself letting a Han dynasty urn fall to the ground, his face impassive as it lay shattered in pieces. In <em>The Liberty of Doubt</em>, that iconic moment is recreated on a grand scale in Lego bricks (one of the artist's favoured materials).</p> <p>Ai also shows us one of his Coca-Cola vases, in which he has treated another piece of Han dynasty earthenware to the familiar curling logo in red paint. He offers a visual thread to its sweeping font by placing it alongside an ancient funerary jar decorated with swirling clouds, designed to be placed in a tomb to accompany the dead into another world. Both vessels hint at the unexpected afterlives of objects: one defaced with the branding of modern capitalism, the other venerated on a plinth.</p> <p>In a repurposed mahogany display case which once sat in the British Museum, Ai offers up a cabinet of curiosities: a roll of toilet paper and a takeaway box sculpted in gleaming white stone, a pair of handcuffs and anal beads carved out of jet-black jade. His “Surveillance Camera with Plinth” (2014) squats close by, in which the marble CCTV head perches on a pedestal modelled after a lamppost from the Northern Qi dynasty. And in another typical Weiwei-ism, “Dragon Vase” (2017), Ai sets out to faithfully recreate a piece of red and white Ming porcelain. But whereas the emperor of that era enjoyed the privilege of a dragon motif with five claws (his courtiers were allowed four), Ai cannot resist giving his scaly serpent six talons: a kind of forger's signature.</p> <p>There's an odd feeling in seeing such mischievous art appear alongside works that also boast of their worthiness. A sequence of Ai's “Blue-and-White Porcelain Plates” (2017) feature scenes from the refugee crisis, populated with small dinghies swaying on choppy water, helicopters hovering overhead, and clouds of tear gas. The crude illustrations manage to be both grotesque and banal: the cynical deployment of tropes of south-east Asia in the service of a kind of political slogan. Sincerity is not the same as artistic merit.</p> <p>Sometimes, it feels as if Ai has lost his economy of means in his journey towards celebrity activism. You can feel it in his recent film-making too — for instance, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34645871-d7bd-40e8-80cb-8e215991d5ce\"><em>Cockroach</em></a> (2020), Ai's documentary on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong (which the gallery is screening alongside his other recent films on the refugee crisis and the pandemic in Wuhan). The film is filled with long drone-eye shots as protesters face off against heavily armed police, clouds from smoke grenades slowly drifting down highways, suggesting scenes from an apocalyptic blockbuster. </p> <p>In the history of Chinese social cinema, Ai has played an outsize role: his films on the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and the devastation magnified by the state's failures, emphasised the right of the citizen to confront power, constantly shoving the camera in front of figures of supposed responsibility. That jagged naturalism — of the defiant activist wielding a mobile camera — has slipped away.</p> <p>The installation that Ai creates in the gallery below is more impressive. Here he has placed a collection of ancient figurines recently acquired at auction, many laden with Buddhist symbolism. Some, however, Ai suspects are carefully crafted forgeries. Entering the room, my gaze falls on a handsome wine-coloured hare, carved out of mottled puddingstone: a Sui dynasty paperweight. Paired in the same vitrine is a ghostly hand in lacquered greystone, clutching a bottle: it's a fragment of what was once a Bodhisattva statue, possibly dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty. In another case, a veined black marble Laozi sits with a hint of a smile, waving a fan. But this is a forgery: the apparent signs of age and damage may be the deliberate movement of a chisel — the marks of mischief rather than the marks of time.</p> <p>We behave differently towards something we know is false. We fool ourselves into thinking we can spot the signs of deceit. A Buddhist deity perched on a lotus throne even carries traces of pigment that imply the original once appeared in bright colours: yet this too is thought to be a cunning copy, made in recent decades. The artist Doug Fishbone tried out something similar when he snuck a cheap Chinese knock-off of Fragonard's “Young Woman” (1769) — commissioned from a company in Fujian famed for its counterfeit artworks — into the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 2015 and challenged visitors to spot the fake (they mostly failed).</p> <p>“It's powerful only because someone thinks it's powerful and invests value in the object,” Ai once said of his smashed urn — in destroying it, he was challenging that authority. And in his mission to question the ways we assign value to objects based on notions of authenticity, at Kettle's Yard he poses as both connoisseur and conman. Fakes and copies sabotage the leap of faith involved in looking at art. </p> <p>But the paradox of forgery is that art often requires some measure of self-deception. How many people really know about the specialist fabrication companies that transform the visions of Jeff Koons, for instance, into giant stainless steel balloon dogs? Ai too commissions his finely crafted ceramics from specialist artisans, although you won't see their names on the wall labels.</p> <p>The history of art is also a history of inauthenticity (after all, Michelangelo began his career by forging Roman sculptures, palming them off on to a gullible cardinal). We talk a lot these days about how the contemporary art world has become little more than asset management, filled with arcane sub-deals and inflated sales. Yet none of that would be possible without our belief in the artworks themselves: the hope that we can have an encounter with a piece of the creator's soul. Buyer, beware.</p> <p><em>To June 19, </em><a href=\"https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/\"><em>kettlesyard.co.uk</em></a></p><p>Source: En Liang Khong 2022 'Ai Weiwei at Kettle's Yard — a story of faith and fakes' FT.com 16 February.
