  "title": "How the Frick Collection fares in its temporary home",
  "text": "<p>When pressed, most New Yorkers will plump for the Frick as their favourite museum. They're sentimental and awed by the Met, the mothership, that enduring vessel of surprise and delight that ferries them from toddlerhood to old age. But the Frick is uniquely alluring, a fantastical, gracious fortress hunkered across Fifth Avenue from Central Park. The old mansion spurns attention, yielding its splendours to the initiated. Enter the Frick and time falls away. You get to be a Gilded Age master of the universe, without the exploitation. Opulent rooms, light-filled courtyard, murmuring fountain and multitudinous masterpieces are arrayed for your delectation. A few fellow magnates mill quietly about, but they don't disturb the illusion that this bounteous casket of treasures is your private domain.</p> <p>For the moment, though, that dream has been interrupted. The Frick is expanding: the second floor (once the family's quarters, later museum offices) will one day open to the public, and the displaced staff will decamp to an addition designed by Annabelle Selldorf, an architect who specialises in elegant restraint. It looked, for a time, as though renovation would leave the precious contents temporarily homeless or in storage, but this museum got lucky when another stumbled. The Met had rented the old Whitney, designed by Marcel Breuer, but financial problems made the deal burdensome. Perfect timing: the Frick took over the last three years of the lease so its collection could remain on view without abandoning the Upper East Side.</p> <p>I approached “Frick Madison” (which opens to the public on March 18) with trepidation. Would my old friends look naked in the stripped-down modernist setting? Would they miss all the upholstery and bibelots? Nope. The Breuer building, lovingly spiffed up by the Met when it took over in 2016, is as luxe as brutalism can get. Exuberant in its austerity, it proves the perfect way to see the Frick's masterpieces as if for the first time. Perfectly lit, generously spaced, and hung at eye level against gunmetal grey walls, they seem to glow from within.</p> <p>Bellini's “St Francis in the Desert” gets a chapel-like room to itself, and one of Breuer's eccentrically angled windows bathes the painting in heavenly light cascading from East 75th Street. Exiting his cave, the saint throws open his arms to the rising sun, which illuminates his stigmata and also picks out details I had never registered: a hare's head popping out of its burrow, a grey heron perched on an outcropping, a shepherd huddled in the shadows with his flock. The staff have thoughtfully provided a bench, offering a chance to commune with the painting and savour its meticulous texture and theatrical magic.</p> <p>Back home, the Frick's bounty was grouped along elastic lines of sensibility, origin, style and, occasionally, history. Here, the breakdown is more orderly, beginning on the second floor with 15th-century northern Europe and winding its way upwards towards Renoir. In one of the magnificent early galleries, Holbein's portraits of Henry VIII's two Thomases, More and Cromwell, hang companionably side by side, without the impediment of an imposing fireplace between them. The two life-long rivals might have appreciated, or perhaps resented, the proximity; both served their ruler, then succumbed to his caprices and lost their heads.</p> <p>The men appear to be studying each other closely, as they do in Hilary Mantel's <em>Wolf Hall</em>. The virtuosity lavished on More's obscenely splendid sleeves doesn't distract from the man's thoughtful expression, piercing eyes and enormous nose. The red velvet costume pays homage to his allure. Cromwell, in profile, is a cipher, his mouth pinched into a frown, his double chin sinking heavily into a fur collar. Holbein casts him much deeper into the space, behind a table piled high with the paraphernalia of statecraft.</p> <p>The next showstopper is the resplendent figure of Rembrandt, in all his golden glory. Three of his paintings hang in a boudoir-like chamber, engaging in cosy conversation. The excellent audio guide, accessible on a free app, lingers on “The Polish Rider,” once my favourite denizen of the Frick (until a haughty Bronzino portrait nudged it out of first place). Chief curator Xavier Salomon offers various solutions to the painting's enigmas and lands charmingly on a quotation from the poem “Having a Coke with You” by Frank O'Hara:</p> <p><em>. . . I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world<br>except possibly for the&#xa0;‘Polish Rider'&#xa0;occasionally and anyway it's in the Frick<br>which thank heavens you haven't gone to yet so we can go together for the first time</em></p> <p>The move to the Breuer allows Salomon and his fellow curators to deconstruct the collection into its component parts, making space for less diva-like works. The audio guide, narrated this time by curator Aimee Ng, drew my attention to Chardin's tiny tour de force, “Lady with a Bird-Organ”, and I'm grateful for the revelation. A woman, “swathed in drapery” like a piece of decorative furniture, cranks the mechanical instrument to teach her canary how to sing. Incarcerated by her costume and the cramped room, she is not so different from her caged pet: both are ornamental creatures, trained to serve the pleasure of others. Chardin looks back to Vermeer's softly lit interiors and forward to Vuillard's more claustrophobic ones. In the mansion, the two-dimensional spaces bleed into the ornate rooms of the museum. At the Breuer, we can see them for the imaginary worlds they are.</p> <p>The new context invites us to reconsider our prejudices and update our taste. Turner's two operatic seascapes upstaged the rest of the crew in the old West Gallery. Here, they confer with Constable's “White Horse”, whose calculated naturalism dominates the quiet alcove and makes the Turners seem showy. The decorative arts, too, bask in a new limelight, rather than being the background decor that your eye slides over on its way to another big canvas. European and Asian ceramics are displayed in the manner of aristocratic porcelain rooms, organised according to shape and colour, rather than date or nationality. The arrangement challenges viewers to distinguish between Chinese or Japanese originals and European knock-offs. Good luck with that: they're all spectacular.</p> <p>The new habitat reminds me how many obstacles got in the way of pure looking at the mansion, the way you had to cram into vestibules, peer above mantelpieces, and take care not to shatter some precious knick-knack when you stepped back for a better view. Even so, it's good to know that in a couple of years, the artworks will all be back where they belong, surrounded by their companions in the Frick mansion's homey clutter. In the meantime, we can enjoy their extended vacation without guilt or regret.</p> <p><em>From March 18, </em><a href=\"https://www.frick.org/madison\"><em>frick.org/madison</em></a></p><p>Source: Ariella Budick 2021 'How the Frick Collection fares in its temporary home' FT.com 15 March.
