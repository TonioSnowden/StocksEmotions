  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Anjali Sud, chief executive of Vimeo Inc., was only 33 years old when she took charge of the online video platform in 2017. The former diapers marketer had been at Vimeo, then a unit of conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp., for three years. </p><p>\n  Vimeo, now a public company, lets users upload clips for streaming and sharing. Rather than selling ads, it makes money from subscriptions for video-creation, editing and hosting tools aimed at companies and professional content makers. </p><p>\n  The video platform became an important vehicle for sales, training and communications once Covid-19 made businesses more reliant on the internet. Vimeo revenue was at least 40% higher every month between April and December 2020 compared with the year-earlier periods. </p><p>\n  Ms. Sud says she never expected the unprecedented, explosive demand for its video tools to happen so fast. \"It was messy, and it was stressful,\" recalls the CEO, now 38 years old. But, she adds, \"I developed so much as a leader.\" </p><p>\n  Mentors buoy Ms. Sud's confidence about stepping outside her comfort zone. They suggested she create opportunities \"when there is change and challenge,\" she says. \"They encouraged me to bet on myself.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sumaiya Balbale </p><p>\n  Chief marketing officer of Sequoia Capital </p><p>\n  The women became acquainted at Amazon, where Ms. Balbale's roles included running Diapers.com. She chose Ms. Sud as the unit's head of marketing. \"She was smart, curious, optimistic and determined\" -- plus willing to learn, Ms. Balbale recollects. \"I'd take that combo any day over functional experience.\" Ms. Sud admired how her Diapers.com boss managed empathetically. Ms. Balbale once baked cookies for her hardworking management team, for instance. Yet she also held staffers accountable for their results. \"She was the kind of leader I wanted to be,\" Ms. Sud says. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Michael Weissman </p><p>\n  CEO of SoundCloud </p><p>\n  Mr. Weissman wooed Ms. Sud for more than a year before she left Amazon to work for him at Vimeo, where he was chief operating officer. She subsequently considered quitting Vimeo to become chief marketing officer of an education startup. At the time, Ms. Sud was debating whether to accept a Vimeo promotion to general manager -- a position with profit-and-loss responsibilities. \"Am I an idiot for not taking a C-level role [elsewhere]?\" Ms. Sud asked herself. Mr. Weissman urged his protegee to instead look broadly at her career trajectory: \"Focus less on title and more on impact.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Nabil Mallick </p><p>\n  General partner at Thrive Capital </p><p>\n  The Harvard Business School classmates bonded partly because both liked unhealthy food, Ms. Sud says. For an 8 a.m. class, Mr. Mallick \"would show up with a chocolate croissant and Diet Coke.\" Ms. Sud came to appreciate her friend's candid feedback -- especially about risky career moves. After becoming a general manager at Vimeo, she wondered if she would be able to change anything there. Uncertainty about a new role \"is almost better,\" Mr. Mallick told Ms. Sud. \"There's more opportunity for growth.\" He now serves on Vimeo's board. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Mandy Ginsberg </p><p>\n  Former CEO of Match Group Inc. </p><p>\n  Ms. Ginsberg got to know Ms. Sud when both worked at IAC. The longtime executive of Match Group, an IAC unit that went public in 2015, led the online-dating giant between 2018 and 2020. Based on her experience as a public-company CEO, she recommended that Ms. Sud rely on Vimeo directors' perspective following its initial public offering in May 2021. \"Don't create a scenario where you have all the answers\" and merely update board members, Ms. Ginsberg said. She proposed engaging them in discussion before reaching decisions collectively. </p><p></p>",
