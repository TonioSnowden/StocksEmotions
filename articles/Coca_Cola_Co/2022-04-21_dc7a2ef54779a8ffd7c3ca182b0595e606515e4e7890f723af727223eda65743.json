  "title": "Business News: Calpers to Back Bid For Berkshire Chairman",
  "text": "<p>Having the same person hold both roles weakens corporate governance, the National Legal and Policy Center said in the shareholder measure published ahead of Berkshire's April 30 shareholder meeting.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway's board responded by saying it opposes the measure and believes Mr. Buffett should continue to fill both roles. After he departs, a board member who isn't part of management should become chair, the board said.</p><p>A representative from Berkshire wasn't available for comment.</p><p>The measure likely faces long odds. Mr. Buffett alone has a 32% voting interest in Berkshire. Calpers supports re-electing Mr. Buffett to the Berkshire board.</p><p>Companies are increasingly deciding not to have their chief executives serve as chair, according to consulting firm Spencer Stuart. As of last year, 59% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 had split the chair and chief executive roles, compared with 55% the year before and 41% a decade earlier.</p><p>The National Legal and Policy Center filed measures arguing that the chair should be an independent member of the board at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Mondelez International Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and Home Depot Inc., said Peter Flaherty, the group's chairman.</p><p>Calpers, which is a shareholder in all five companies, declined to say specifically whether it would support those proposals. A Calpers spokeswoman said the pension fund generally supports separating the board chair and chief executive roles at all companies in which it owns stock.</p><p>In addition to the proposal concerning Berkshire Hathaway's board chair position, Calpers co-sponsored a separate proposal asking the company for more information on how it manages climate risk.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
