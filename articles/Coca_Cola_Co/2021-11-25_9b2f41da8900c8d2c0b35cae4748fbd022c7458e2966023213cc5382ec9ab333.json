  "text": "<p>Mr. Foley hopes that Kelly's won't be added to the list of closures, though it is taking hits from all sides.</p><p>The usually busy Christmas period will be a key test for pubs across Britain, including Kelly's and Mr. Foley and his partner's two other Liverpool-based pubs.</p><p>\"Kelly's has been hemorrhaging cash,\" he said. \"Pubs are a poster boy for wider troubles in the economy.\"</p><p>British pubs have been under pressure for two decades amid competition from cheap alcohol from grocery stores and other factors like a smoking ban and advances in home entertainment. Since 1995, almost one in four pubs, or 14,200 premises, have closed, according to the British Beer &amp; Pub Association.</p><p>Kelly's is one of the original \"Smithdown Ten,\" a famous bar crawl running down Smithdown Road from near central Liverpool to the street's end near Penny Lane of the Beatles fame. A decade of pub closures means the original Smithdown Ten are now four.</p><p>Pub owners worry the pandemic has accelerated the industry's decline, and some Brits worry further closures could be part of a wider reshaping of the country as the pandemic subsides.</p><p>Lockdowns meant pubs and bars were closed for much of 2020, with pub chain Fuller Smith &amp; Turner PLC saying its premises were open for less than a third of the year. Now that pubs have finally reopened, strains in global supply chains and accelerating inflation pose fresh challenges.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Foley received an email quoting new prices for gas and electricity around 40% higher than his current bill.</p><p>\"I nearly fainted,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Foley is already paying over 6% more for a keg of Guinness, and industry analysts say breweries and distilleries will likely increase prices in the first half of next year to pass on rising costs.</p><p>London-based Five Points Brewing Co. expects to raise the prices of its beer as much as 10% in January to offset more expensive aluminum cans, cardboard packaging and ingredients. \"Almost all of our suppliers at the moment are putting their prices up,\" said Greg Hobbs, its brewing director, adding that he was recently notified of a likely 10% to 20% rise in malt costs for 2022.</p><p>Port and wider transport congestion mean Kelly's didn't have a delivery of Coca-Cola for two weeks. Mr. Foley recently tried to order coffee cups and was told he would need to wait up to six months.</p><p>Kelly's is also struggling to hire workers and wages are rising as a result. Mr. Foley said he recently advertised for a new bar manager. He got one applicant for a role that pre-pandemic would have attracted 40 to 50. He didn't hire that candidate, and Mr. Foley, who has young children, has been working 70-hour weeks to cover.</p><p>New hires want more pay. A bar manager would have earned around £27,000, equivalent to about $36,000, before Covid-19 hit, and now makes £32,000 plus bonuses, Mr. Foley said.</p><p>Though Covid-19 restrictions have eased, publicans—those who own or manage pubs—say they are yet to claw back all of their customers, some of whom got used to drinking at home or remain concerned about infection risks in crowded places.</p><p>At the Boundary Pub, traditionally the first stop on the Smithdown Ten, Roger Dove popped in on a recent afternoon to say hello to the bartender.</p><p>Before the pandemic, Mr. Dove used to drink there every Friday and Saturday night. He hasn't stopped for a drink for eight weeks.</p><p>\"You just get out of the routine,\" the 57-year-old said.</p><p>Mr. Dove has lived in the area since 1997, and remembers the old Smithdown Ten.</p><p>\"They were packed in those days, it was all one big, jolly party,\" he said, gesturing to the pub's sole customer drinking alone amid the ornate tiles and wood paneling of the 120-year-old establishment.</p><p>It is a similar story at the U.K.'s big pub chains. Sales at Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, which controls 384 pubs and hotels, were at 90% of those in 2019 for the seven weeks to this September. At JD Wetherspoon PLC, which manages 860 pubs, sales for the 15 weeks to mid-November were 8.9% lower than in the same period of 2019.</p><p>Older people in particular may be staying at home more as a result of virus-related hesitancy, said Tim Martin, Wetherspoon's chief executive and founder.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has your local pub or bar weathered the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>At Wetherspoon, demand for drinks favored by older customers, like traditional ales, have been hit particularly hard, with sales down 30% over the same period. Fewer people are going to the pub for lunch and breakfast because they are working from home more, Mr. Martin said.</p><p>Pubs are trying to adapt to the changes brought by Covid-19, making it easier and more comfortable to drink outside and order via apps, rather than at crowded bars.</p><p>Still, the coming weeks are set to be a test of the enduring appeal of the local pub, which for centuries has been a part of Britain's national identity, where communities gather and people mix.</p><p>Some of Smithdown's pubs are already lit up with Christmas decorations.</p><p>\"If you don't have a good December, you won't make a good profit for the year,\" Mr. Foley said of the industry.</p><p>By late September, the British Beer &amp; Pub Association's members had secured only half the Christmas party bookings they typically would have at that point of the year.</p><p>Despite the pressures, Mr. Foley is cautiously optimistic about Kelly's. He believes much is at stake in the survival of such pubs, which he describes as part of Britain's cultural fabric.</p><p>\"I'd hate to see my kids grow up in a country where these buildings are no longer part of the community,\" he said, looking around the decades-old pub as the bartender prepared for opening.</p><p>Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com</p><p>The Great British Pub Has a Pandemic Hangover.
