  "text": "<p>So, at 10:45 a.m. on June 16, 2014, his agent was going to pull his name from the draft. Then something peculiar happened. NBA teams started calling—and begging him to reconsider. The reaction to his first tweet was so overwhelming that he sent another tweet at 5 p.m.</p><p>\"We change direction,\" he wrote, \"and Nikola Jokic from Mega keeps his name on draft!\"</p><p>That decision was the beginning of perhaps the single greatest draft selection in basketball history. It would put a guy who was discovered less than a decade ago in the pages of a Serbian newspaper on track to be the next Most Valuable Player of the NBA, and it would turn the Denver Nuggets into the first title contender built around a No. 41 pick.</p><p>It has become delightfully clear to anyone who follows the NBA that it's a league with nobody else like Nikola Jokic —and not just because of the way he plays.</p><p>There are 21 players who have been MVPs since Michael Jordan was drafted. Eight of them were No. 1 picks. Nine others were top-10 picks. The rest were taken before the 15th pick. NBA teams are wrong all the time in all kinds of curious ways, but they're rarely wrong about identifying the pure talent required of the game's superstars. And then Jokic came plodding along.</p><p>By almost every meaningful statistical measurement, he's been the NBA 's best player this season. He's averaging 26 points, 10.9 rebounds and 8.6 assists with the most efficient shooting numbers of his career. In terms of win shares per minute, a metric that captures his overall value, he's also the most productive second-round pick of all time.</p><p>There has never been anyone the league was so wrong about—including the team that was right.</p><p>\"If we knew,\" said Nuggets president Tim Connelly last season, \"we would've taken him earlier.\"</p><p>The unlikely marriage of Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets began with a man named Misko Raznatovic. The agent was flipping through a Serbian sports newspaper when the box scores of a junior league caught his attention. A young player was putting up numbers that appeared to be typos, and Raznatovic had never heard of him. He wanted to know more.</p><p>This was oddly difficult. Jokic was so unknown that even Raznatovic's scout wasn't aware of his existence. He directed that scout to make contact with Jokic's family sight unseen. \"It was probably the first and last time in my career that I did that,\" Raznatovic said in an email.</p><p>Then he put a face and body to the name.</p><p>\"I remember thinking that he was a nice guy,\" Raznatovic said, \"who did not look good physically.\"</p><p>Nuggets staffers had the same first impression. A look at Jokic was all it took to realize there needed to be less of him. He would savor his favorite drink  for the last time on the flight to Denver.</p><p>\"If I saw that dude drinking Coke,\" said former Nuggets strength coach Steve Hess, \"I'd stab him in the eye with a pencil.\"</p><p>Those eyes are his most important physical trait—the Denver offense  that ranks among the best in NBA history is a ballet around his spectacular passing—but Jokic would transform the rest of his body under the threat of ocular harm. When he sent Connelly a shirtless photo during the league's pandemic break, the general manager who drafted him had to squint to recognize him. \"He's got abs,\" Connelly told Altitude Sports Radio. \"I've never seen him have abs.\"</p><p>It was only the latest improbable twist in his career. After he was plucked from the pages of a newspaper, Jokic was sent to Mega Basket, where the plan was to develop him at his signature tempo: slowly. In his first month with the club, Jokic was limited to solo training. Mega coach Dejan Milojevic felt he simply wasn't ready for practice yet. But the speed of what happened next stunned him. \"He improved and he started practicing—and he was improving so fast that I started playing him literally the month after,\" Milojevic said. He entered the NBA draft one year later.</p><p>The idea that a pudgy, anonymous prospect can become an MVP with abs is what makes the draft so tantalizing—and so maddening. The whole point of this exercise in uncertainty is to project the talent of a teenager many years later with millions of dollars riding on his performance and millions of people watching his first days at work.</p><p>It was easy to sleep on Jokic. In fact, he did.</p><p>Jokic slept through the draft and didn't hear his name called at 5:45 a.m. local time. He woke up and found out that his life had changed.</p><p>\"I don't think he quite understood what had happened to him,\" Raznatovic said. \"Anyhow, he wasn't excited at all.\"</p><p>It was hard to blame him. The first player the Nuggets took in that draft was Bosnian center Jusuf Nurkic. That is, they selected a massive human from the Balkans, and it wasn't Nikola Jokic. Only with their third selection that night did they get around to snagging his rights. They're now ecstatic to admit they got lucky. \"There were other guys we liked we could've easily picked,\" Connelly said.</p><p>By the time he moved to Denver after spending another year in Belgrade, Jokic was no longer the same prospect the Nuggets had drafted. Now he was an MVP—of the Adriatic League. Jokic hadn't played a game but already looked like a coup.</p><p>It was one of the many breaks that are necessary for NBA success. Before they won three championships in five years, the Golden State Warriors nailed three draft picks in five years: Curry in 2009, Klay Thompson in 2011 and Draymond Green with the No. 35 pick in 2012—also the third player they selected that night. The Nuggets are following the Warriors' blueprint. They took Jokic in 2014, Jamal Murray in 2016 and Michael Porter Jr. in 2018. Now they're title contenders.</p><p>The epiphany that someone who looks like Nikola Jokic could be a superstar hit different people at different points for entirely different reasons. There was the time he survived 65 minutes in a playoff game. There was the time he came back  from a 3-1 series hole. There was the other time he came back from 3-1 in the bubble.</p><p>But the first time that Hess was astounded by Jokic—a man he described as \"a lion,\" and \"not a pretend lion\"—was before his rookie season.</p><p>\"You should've seen him,\" he said, \"in this paintball game.\"</p><p>The Nuggets split into two teams for that paintball game. One team was good. Jokic was on the other team. \"We had the worst guys. We had the worst guns. And we killed them,\" Hess said.</p><p>Hess had been worried about injuries sustained in the line of paint fire until his enormous target of a teammate began sprinting through bushes to avoid getting splattered. He forgot his concerns and called Connelly as soon as he could.</p><p>\"You've got a beast,\" he said.</p><p>\"You watched him hoop?\"</p><p>\"Nah!\" Hess said. \"Paintball.\"</p><p>Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com </p><p>With the 41st Pick in the NBA Draft, the Denver Nuggets Select…the Next MVP</p>",
