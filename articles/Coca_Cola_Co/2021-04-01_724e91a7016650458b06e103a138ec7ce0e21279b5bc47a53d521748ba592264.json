  "title": "Black Executives Fight  Restrictive Voter Rules  ----  By Te-Ping Chen and Cameron McWhirter",
  "text": "<p>   Dozens of prominent Black executives called on corporations to fight Republican-led legislation they say would limit voting access for Black voters in numerous states, and Delta Air Lines Inc.'s chief executive publicly clashed with Georgia's governor over a similar law passed there last week. </p><p>   The efforts by Black business leaders, as well as new statements from Delta, Coca-Cola Co. and other companies on Wednesday, come after civil-rights advocates had for days said Georgia-based corporations hadn't done enough to push back against that new state voting law. </p><p>   Opponents say the new voting rules will make it harder for voters in underrepresented communities to cast ballots, while backers say the rules are needed to preserve election integrity. </p><p>   Though Delta, Coca-Cola and other corporations with headquarters in Atlanta had said they had worked behind the scenes to lobby Georgia lawmakers to make changes to the legislation, they had largely refrained from publicly criticizing it -- prompting boycott calls from some voting-rights activists. </p><p>   In a Wednesday appearance on CNBC, Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey said the company had always opposed the legislation, which he called unacceptable. Private efforts to lobby hadn't worked, he said, \"and so we're being more forceful in our public position.\" </p><p>   The 72 Black executives, who include Merck &amp; Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier, former American Express Co. CEO Kenneth Chenault and Mellody Hobson, Starbucks Corp. chairwoman and co-CEO of Ariel Investments LLC, signed an open letter published in a full-page New York Times ad on Wednesday. In it, they pushed companies and business leaders across the country to sway legislative debate. </p><p>   \"This is a nonpartisan issue, this is a moral issue,\" Mr. Chenault said in an interview. Mr. Frazier said that as dozens of other states consider similar legislation, companies must act. \"This is not a Georgia issue,\" he said. </p><p>   Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox Holdings Corp. and another signatory to the letter, said she had reached out to board colleagues at Exxon Mobil Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc., where she is a board member, to ask what action they plan to take. She said she expected directors at other companies to do the same. \"People are going to have to respond,\" she said. \"Companies are going to have to say something.\" </p><p>   Republican legislators in Georgia have said new rules are needed, in part to assure the public that voting is fair and to ease concerns there might have been fraud this past election season. No court or legislative body has found evidence of widespread voter fraud. </p><p>   Despite pressure from then-President Donald Trump to overturn the results, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, Georgia's secretary of state and other Republican officials also affirmed the integrity of the state's 2020 presidential election after conducting two statewide recounts and a partial audit of mail-in votes in one county. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian issued a memo to employees more sharply criticizing the new Georgia law than the company had in previous statements. After he had time to fully understand the legislation's provisions and speak to Black community leaders and employees, he said, it became evident the law would make it harder for many voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their right to vote. \"That is wrong,\" he wrote. </p><p>   \"I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta's values,\" he added in the memo. </p><p>   Mr. Bastian also criticized lawmakers who had pushed for Georgia's law. \"The entire rationale for the bill was based on a lie,\" he said, calling allegations of widespread voter fraud \"simply not true.\" </p><p>   Mr. Kemp, who signed the bill into law last week, took issue with Mr. Bastian's memo, saying that his office had consulted regularly with Delta and that the company had made no objections. \"At no point did Delta share any opposition to expanding early voting, strengthening voter ID measures, increasing the use of secure drop boxes statewide and making it easier for local election officials to administer elections -- which is exactly what this bill does,\" he said. </p><p>    The Georgia law, which was passed by both chambers along party lines, is far less extensive than numerous bills that were initially proposed by the state's GOP legislators. The law requires absentee voters to request ballots by providing their driver's license number, the last four digits of their Social Security number or a copy of some other accepted form of identification. They also have to provide this information when they mail in their ballots. Currently, people sign an absentee-ballot application and sign an inside envelope containing the ballot when they mail it in. </p><p>   The law also places new limits on how parties and voting groups mail out absentee-ballot request forms, and limits the number of ballot drop boxes to one per county except for large counties, which can set up one box for every 100,000 registered voters. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alison Sider contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
