  "title": "Reports of the Choco Taco's Death Are Possibly Exaggerated; It turns out killing the Choco Taco was what it took for the wacky ice cream treat to get its due. And it may not be frozen out for long.",
  "text": "<p>Unilever, the parent company of Klondike, blamed an \"unprecedented spike in demand\" and the pandemic supply chain for what it called \"a necessary but unfortunate\" decision to discontinue some of its products. \"Even a beloved item like Choco Taco,\" it said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Klondike said killing the Choco Taco wasn't a ploy to sell more Choco Tacos. But within a few days of announcing its demise in the middle of summer, as social media was melting into a puddle of eulogies, the company said it was already \"exploring options to bring it back.\"</p><p>\"Stay tuned…\" Klondike's Twitter account teased, under an image of a Choco Taco holding a press conference.</p><p>Alan Drazen, who created the novelty close to 40 years ago, learned about his lone invention's apparent death along with the rest of us. He says he's received thousands of emails, texts and calls since then—including mine one morning this week.</p><p>I tracked him down because I had many questions, such as why I felt myself craving a Choco Taco for breakfast, but first I was hoping he could explain what made his concoction so irresistible. I had my own theories about the appeal of this mischievously shaped indulgence with a funny name. I wanted the expert's opinion.</p><p>\"The cone. The nuts. The chocolate. The fudge,\" said the 68-year-old former Good Humor truck driver and member of the International Association of Ice Cream Distributors &amp; Vendors' Hall of Fame. \"You're getting the full experience—all those flavor notes—with just about every bite.\"</p><p>Nearly every revolutionary product is a feat of clever engineering and scrappy marketing that requires being in the right place at the right time, which for Mr. Drazen was the Philadelphia offices of Jack &amp; Jill Ice Cream Co. in 1983.</p><p>Things were slowing down at work in the fall, so he decided to use the annual lull for research and development. Jack &amp; Jill was starting its own brand of ice cream, and Mr. Drazen was brainstorming when his mind wandered to Mexican food.</p><p>The thought of chimichangas made him think something else: eureka.</p><p>\"I have an idea,\" Mr. Drazen told his boss.</p><p>\"What is it?\"</p><p>\"An ice-cream taco.\"</p><p>He was immediately granted permission to make his dream a reality. Without so much as a prototype, he got on a plane to dairy country. Green Bay, Wis., was packed with everything he needed.</p><p>A few machines in the Ace Baking Co.'s factory engineered for drumstick cones were repurposed for sweeter taco shells, which were shipped to the headquarters of Gold Bond Ice Cream down the street. There they were filled with vanilla ice cream and fudge before they fell apart. At that point the shell was sealed with a layer of chocolate to keep it from getting soggy. The secret sauce of the ice cream taco was metalized polypropylene, the material of the wrappers, which was strong enough to keep the creations fresh and maintain their structural integrity.</p><p>Now that Mr. Drazen had a product, it was time for a name. His company had hired an advertising firm for the job, but he beat them to it when he blurted out two words that would change his life.</p><p>Choco Taco.</p><p>Then he went looking for a market. Mr. Drazen tapped his connections and persuaded friends with ice cream trucks across the country to stock the Choco Taco as a personal favor. When he couldn't get anybody at Taco Bell to return his calls, he targeted locations that were independently owned, taking a booth at the franchise trade show and pitching them one by one. While selling branded products not authorized by the corporate office was technically against their franchise agreements, many renegades proved willing to take a risk on Choco Taco.</p><p>Mr. Drazen says he eventually received a call back from the chain's management. He no longer had to sneak through the backdoor: Taco Bell struck a deal to carry his product. The corporate overlords couldn't resist Choco Tacos.</p><p>The figment of one person's imagination would make its way into countless Good Humor freezers over the next few decades. But any idea is only as good as its execution. When he thinks about Choco Tacos, which he does often, Mr. Drazen flashes back to his first taste of success, when moxie, strategy and luck worked in his favor.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When was the last time you ate a Choco Taco? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Unilever, the British conglomerate, got into the Choco Taco business when it bought Gold Bond decades ago. Mr. Drazen left Jack &amp; Jill earlier this year, after it was acquired by a private-equity company. The news about his dessert reached him at the same time as millions of people who have eaten one.</p><p>\"I believe if there had never been Covid and never been the war in Ukraine,\" he said, \"the Choco Taco would be rolling along.\"</p><p>But there is a long tradition of fans bringing dead products back to life, including Coke made with the original formula, TV shows like \"Family Guy\" and even Taco Bell's own novelty pizza. That history makes Mr. Drazen hopeful the uproar will help revive his innovation. \"I think they're seeing something they never expected,\" he said.</p><p>He knows better than anyone how powerful that can be.</p><p>Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com</p><p>Reports of the Choco Taco's Death Are Possibly Exaggerated</p>",
