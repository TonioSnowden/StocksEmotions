  "text": "<p>Langhorne Slim, \"Strawberry Mansion\" (Dualtone Music). Born Sean Scolnick in 1980, Langhorne Slim grew up in southeast Pennsylvania, attested to by his performing name (Langhorne, Pa., was his home town) and the title of this latest album, which nods to his two grandfathers' Philadelphia neighborhood. With strong pop sensibilities, hooky melodies and alternative country-inflected lyrics, he has been recording for 15 years and has been a strong touring act. Many first heard his amiable earworm choruses in national ad campaigns for Travelers Insurance (\"Worries\") and Coca-Cola (\"Put It Together\"). Then he relocated to East Nashville, Tenn., just in time for the tornado that hit the neighborhood in March and the Covid-19 pandemic that quickly followed.</p><p>Those setbacks, and an acknowledged bout of depression that accompanied them, engendered a burst of creativity and these 18 new songs -- short, focused, and frank in dealing with the gloom. The opener, \"Mighty Soul,\" written with Kenny Siegal, refers to the tornado and plague directly, yet it remains spirited and spiritual. (\"We will endure this wretched toll. Let us pour love into the Mighty Soul.\") In \"Lonesome Times,\" he comforts a tearful companion, and in \"Panic Attack\" he turns to a health-care professional who says \"Son, there may be no cure, but I swear that life's worth living.\"</p><p>In Langhorne Slim's melodically capable hands, the darker passing moods and thoughts are all delivered in frisky, good-natured style, backed by his multi-instrumentalist friends and co-producers Paul DeFiglia and Mat Davidson. The songs are like feel-better missives from a whimsical but reliable buddy.</p><p>Selwyn Birchwood, \"Living in a Burning House\" (Alligator Records). This singer-songwriter, who just received a Blues Music Awards nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Male Artist, is intent on both working in that idiom and expanding on it. The sounds on his previous two albums were surprising for the blues -- the lap steel guitar, more often associated with country and Hawaiian music, was central to Mr. Birchwood's much-lauded guitar work, and Regi Oliver's baritone sax also played a prominent role. This time around, blues session veteran Tom Hambridge is on board as producer, and that original combination is thickened further with organ and piano by Walter \"Bunt\" May.</p><p>The 35-year-old son of a British mother and a father from Tobago, born and raised in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Birchwood became interested in the blues via Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Guy records -- electric 1960s influences unmistakable on this new set. He refers to the sound achieved as \"electric swamp funkin' blues,\" and his vocals, while polished, are as tough as these funky sounds demand.</p><p>The 13 songs, all composed by Mr. Birchwood and constructed for drama, emphasize storytelling, a relatively infrequent approach in blues songwriting. For example, a clean, anxious guitar line leads into the narrative on the title track. \"I'm smellin' smoke, and I know something's burning. . .can't bring myself to leave my home. . ..And all I know is this don't feel like romance.\" The relationship story and sound combine to haunt beyond their specific references, as the best blues songs will, and feeling haunted and stuck will no doubt be broadly understood right now. In other songs (\"My Happy Place,\" \"Searching for My Tribe\") musical boundaries supply another confinement metaphor.</p><p>In the latter he sings, \"I've always been a loner, but never liked being alone.\" With the continuing leaps forward this artist takes album by album, the instrumental prowess he shows, and lines like that one, he's going to be finding a lot of friends.</p><p>Rod Abernethy, \"Normal Isn't Normal Anymore\" (Songs From Downstairs Records, Feb. 5). Hailing from North Carolina's Research Triangle, this performing songwriter has been making records since 1975, some for major labels. But most of his focus had been on composing for film and such videogame soundtracks as \"Star Trek: Encounters\" and \"The Hobbit.\" He's turned to alternative folk-tinged material in the past few years -- mainly original, often witty, and with the accent on character sketches.</p><p>The bouncy \"It's Always Something\" comes from that lighter side. (\"I keep trying the best I can do, but it's always something that I did or didn't do.\" ) And, yes, he knows he didn't quite form a rhyme there. In \"My Father Was a Quiet Man,\" he raises memories of a strong father who chose his few words carefully and wonders if his own adult son will understand how he's sometimes that quiet himself. (Mr. Abernethy is 67 years old.) The differences between how life was and how narrowed, changed and trying it can become is a continuing, nostalgia-free theme -- for someone riding with a once-close brother in \"Just Get In the Car\"; or for a veteran now confined to a wheelchair and a wife now trying to handle her husband's medical bills in \"Another Year.\"</p><p>Here, too, impressive guitar-picking is an attraction in itself, and Mr. Abernethy proves an adept, vocal interpreter with his takes on John Mayer's \"Changing\" and Bob Dylan's \"Oxford Town.\" The title song was apparently written just before the pandemic hit, but certainly applies today: \"Talking heads on my TV; who can I trust who can I believe?\" he asks, then adds: \"The world I once knew seems so far away. . .I feel like I'm drowning in the pouring rain. Normal isn't normal anymore.\" It could be an anthem.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Mazor reviews country and roots music for the Journal.</p>",
