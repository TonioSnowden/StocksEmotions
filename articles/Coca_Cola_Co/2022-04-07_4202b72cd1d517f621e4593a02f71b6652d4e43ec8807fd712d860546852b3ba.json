  "text": "<p>The two racers, childhood friends who are now a trucking executive and a hardwood salesman, had arrived at the finish line after stopping the car to chase a man dressed as red-and-white-striped children's character Waldo around Vegas' seedy \"Glitter Gulch,\" i.e., Fremont Street, desperate to nab the photo with him that was a prerequisite to completing the race.</p><p>\"Waldo ran from us,\" said Mr. Skinner, 43, adding an expletive and thumbing a cigarette. \"He's lucky he didn't run past the end of the block, or he was about to get tackled.\"</p><p>The rally, called Fool's Roll because it is held each year near April 1, is a simple concept with a maniacal flourish. Teams, which this year included friends, families, several doctors and one former Nascar driver-turned-ringer, must drive the roughly 1,200 mile trek, on any route they like, in a vehicle that costs no more than $2,000. Breakdowns, and meltdowns, are all but guaranteed. </p><p>Willis Skinner, left, and George Gault from team 'Rolling Mullets' look for college student Caleb Lewis, dressed as Waldo, to get a photo on Fremont Street in Las Vegas.

Each person pays a $2,500 entry fee, which includes a blowout weekend in Las Vegas after all the teams arrive at the finish line at the Wynn.</p><p>Fool's Roll, now in its 10th year, attracts a motley crew of well-to-do Texans willing to lose a bit of money and a lot of dignity. Among this year's 23 teams was one inspired by the band Mötley Crüe, complete with shoulder-length black wigs. They started red hot, but went away mad.</p><p>Teams may use their budgets however they wish, buying old reliables such as decommissioned taxis, represented twice in this year's race. Other less practical entries included a 40-year-old firetruck, a limousine lifted on 35-inch purple rims (\"awful on the inside…the only thing that hasn't happened to it is a fire,\" according to its driver), a 1991 blue Corvette, a Lincoln town car with a Budweiser tap installed next to the gas tank and a remarkably realistic re-creation of the fictional news van from the film \"Anchorman.\" </p><p>The \"Golden Girls\" teammates pour out of a car near Fremont Street as they rush to find college student Caleb Lewis dressed as Waldo, a side quest of the race, in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada on March 31, 2022. PHOTO: Bridget Bennett for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The race this year began the evening of March 30 as the last gasps of sunlight dipped over the starting line at a mansion on Austin's Colorado River rented by Cord Shiflet, a real-estate broker to the local elite. He reminded racers, many clad in costumes, of the rules: Speeding is permitted, but receiving a speeding ticket is an automatic disqualifier. Car modifications are kosher, provided they don't bring the total cost of the vehicle over the limit, but external gas tanks are forbidden. Fuel receipts are checked after the race to ensure that vehicles are driven, not towed.</p><p>There are also banned words. \"The lawyers don't like when we call it a 'race,'\" Mr. Shiflet announced, to titters. \"It's a 'timed event.'\"</p><p>The first Fool's Roll was held in 2010, and it has continued every year save for the pandemic. The idea came about when Mr. Shiflet, a car collector with a Lamborghini and Ferrari in his fleet, suggested to a handful of friends they drive to Las Vegas in some of the worst cars they could find. Interest from others, including strangers, soon followed. </p><p>A team in a jacked-up limo approaches the finish line at Wynn. PHOTO: Bridget Bennett for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>First-time participant Russell Becker, a bridge contractor by trade and pro-am motorcycle racer, had been practicing for weeks for this year's race. He bought the most reliable car he could find, a diesel-fueled, cherry-red 2001 Volkswagen Beetle, and practiced racing it on deserted Texas highways. The night before the race, his wife filled the car with Atkins shakes, granola bars, two turkey sandwiches, yogurt, bananas, and a roll of toilet paper. \"We're going to win,\" he told her, they both confirmed.</p><p>There are teams that play by the rules, and teams that will play dirty for an extra lift. One team said they had a private jet lined up to pick them up if their vehicle broke (it didn't). Startup investor Jason Floyd, a four-time racer, said he knew of teams that had flown to Las Vegas, and shipped their cars separately, making it seem like they had driven the course. Some racers confessed to exceeding the budget and expected to be disqualified.</p><p>Mike Minns, a 46-year-old real-estate broker, says he learned his lesson his first year when he dressed as a cop and rallied in a retired police cruiser with nearly 200,000 miles on the odometer and no air conditioning. His fake mustache melted off as he crossed the Arizona desert.</p><p>Since then, he says, \"we cheat like hell.\" </p><p>Darin Walker, center, and teammates from 'Channel 4 News' make their way back to their van after finding Waldo. PHOTO: Bridget Bennett for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>This year's effort was particularly frantic, because used cars are in extraordinarily high demand after the pandemic crimped new car production. Even in more ordinary markets, there's little breathing room on the budget, as Mr. Shiflet found out one year when he bought at auction a used sedan for his father to use in the race that couldn't drive in reverse.</p><p>One vehicle didn't make it to the start this year: A motorcycle expired mere feet from the starting line. Mr. Becker's Beetle also needed emergency care. The alternator blew on the way to the starting line, sending him searching for a last-minute repair.</p><p>The firetruck and its five-man crew—two of whom had to ride on the cab's outdoor seats at all times because of space constraints—needed their own rescue, after breaking down in the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. About 90 minutes later, a passing Coca-Cola truck driver was able to help.</p><p>There is always a compulsory pit stop. In prior years, the detours have included a bowling game in New Mexico (scores were added to race times to determine the overall winner), a contest at an all-night shooting range and even an optional sojourn to Mexico. Vehicles that dipped across the border received a 90-minute credit on their times.</p><p>The twist for this year was that there were two twists. First, racers had to stop at an Albuquerque-area casino and take a photo in front of an aging slot machine. Later, teams were instructed to divert to downtown Las Vegas and take a picture with a man dressed as Waldo on bustling Fremont Street.</p><p>Waldo, also known as 19-year-old University of Nevada, Las Vegas freshman Caleb Lewis, had high-jinks of his own. Not only did Mr. Lewis, who was hired by Mr. Shiflet for the job, run from some teams, he offered side deals to others. For $100 tips, he offered to disappear inside a local hotel before the next team arrived. Two teams took him up on the offer.</p><p>\"Gotta make money,\" said Mr. Lewis, an accounting major. </p><p>Mr. Lewis, dressed as Waldo, made himself hard to find in downtown Las Vegas. Getting a photo with him was one of the race's challenges. PHOTO: Bridget Bennett for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Becker, the experienced motorcycle racer, was the last to arrive, at around 4 a.m. on April 1, more than 12 hours later than the first finishers. He was in no laughing mood. \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I think everyone else cheated.\"</p><p>After a review of each team's start and finish times, the Corvette was declared the winner by a 15-minute margin. The team, whose name contains two unprintable Spanish profanities, said it swapped for the car on Facebook Marketplace with winnings from a Super Bowl contest.</p><p>Per tradition, each team sold its clunker car in Las Vegas and then wagered the proceeds on a single roulette spin in the high-limit area. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, an unlikely proportion of racers said they wound up winners from their spins. </p><p>'Channel 4 News' teammates styled themselves after the movie 'Anchorman.'
