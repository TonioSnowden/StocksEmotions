  "text": "<p><strong>Shiza Shahid, of Our Place cookware and ex-CEO of the Malala Fund&#xa0;<br></strong>“Oat milk for making haldi doodh [turmeric lattes], chai or smoothies in the morning; iced matcha for an afternoon pick-me-up; berries – I'll have them in yoghurt, drinks, or on their own; and kombucha because I love the fruity, bubbly flavour as I wind down in the evening.”</p>  <p><strong>Patrick Kinmonth, artist and designer<br></strong>“White Truffle Sea Salt from Zest &amp; Zing – it's a major upgrade for a boiled egg. Also Polish dried sausages or ‘kabanos', charcuterie from <a href=\"https://theartisanfoodvillage.com/\">Cornish Charcuterie</a> in Norton Barton, and salads, vegetables and edible flowers from our organic smallholding in north Devon.”</p>  <p><strong>Laila Gohar, food artist<br></strong>“In my fridge you'll always find capers, anchovies, butter and champagne – I am 100 per cent loyal to <a href=\"https://www.perrier-jouet.com/en-ww\">Perrier-Jouët</a>. I especially love the Blanc de Blancs.”</p>  <p><strong>Leanne Shapton, author and artist&#xa0;<br></strong>“Bags of ice – I use so much ice. There's also always <a href=\"https://www.conservasortiz.com/i/products/anchovies/\">Ortiz</a> anchovies, smoked trout, Heinz ketchup and pickle: Branston pickle, pickled fiddlehead ferns, pickled Brussels sprouts and bread-and-butter pickle.”</p>  <p><strong>Vincenzo de Cotiis, architect and artist<br></strong>“Carefully selected water in glass bottles. I like St Georges which is the purest water I've ever tasted. Water in plastic is a no-no: it contaminates everything, including your thoughts. And there's usually some Dom Pérignon.” </p>  <p><strong>Rufus Wainwright, musician and composer<br></strong>“Mini Babybel cheeses – they probably shouldn't be there, they're like a posh Velveeta. When I have my Babybel, it's me thinking I'm fancy when I'm not. And then maple syrup – I always have to have plenty around just to prove I'm Canadian. I put it in my tea and coffee and occasionally, if I'm having a bad day, I'll take a couple of swigs right from the bottle instead of having a glass of wine.”</p>  <p><strong>Sinéad Burke, disability activist and CEO of accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens<br></strong>“Basic items that allow me to eat without much preparation. I'm not very domesticated. I always have Parmesan, spinach, kimchi, Diet Coke. And peanut rayu made by an amazing Irish company called White Mausu. It's a nutty, spicy condiment that you can put on absolutely anything.” <a href=\"https://www.whitemausu.com/\"><em>White Mausu</em></a><em> peanut rayu, €36 for six jars</em></p>  <p><strong>Virginie Mouzat, former fashion and lifestyle editor of French </strong><em><strong>Vanity Fair</strong></em><strong><br></strong>“Fermented Japanese prunes, called ume. They are very salty, so you have to have them on a neutral base – I just eat one with white rice and it's fabulous.”&#xa0;</p>  <p><strong>Ken Fulk, interior designer<br></strong>“Oat milk for my morning coffee and splits of <a href=\"https://www.ruinart.com\">Ruinart</a> rosé champagne for guests. If you're offered champagne, never refuse – or so the saying goes.”</p>  <p><strong>Rita Konig, interior designer<br></strong>“White wine, San Pellegrino, tonic water and a bar of Italian dark chocolate with almonds from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/supermarketofdreams/?hl=en\">Supermarket of Dreams</a> on Holland Park Avenue. I have two fridges – one for drinks and the other for food, which tends to be feast or famine. I am envious of those American fridges that are so perfectly styled, full of glass Tupperwares with delicious things in. Mine is sadly not like that.”</p>  <p><strong>Kean Etro, fashion designer<br></strong>“<a href=\"https://delfanti.com/\">Delfanti</a> black garlic. I love garlic because it's a natural antibiotic.”</p>  <p><strong>Claudia Roden, food writer<br></strong>“I feel that I haven't got anything if I don't have plenty of vegetables – peppers, tomatoes, aubergines, courgettes, radishes, cucumber – as well as a few cheeses and salamis. I also have tahini, harissa and things that I make, such as boiled lemons in olive oil, tapenade and muhammara, a pepper and walnut paste. And leftovers. Whenever I have friends and family around to eat I always, always overproduce.”</p>  <p><strong>T-Michael, fashion designer<br></strong>“A hot chilli paste from Ghana called shito. Aubergines. Miso paste. Soy. Parmesan. Franciacorta. Pancetta. And fresh, fiery Scotch bonnets.”&#xa0;</p>  <p><strong>Gucci Westman, make-up artist and founder of Atelier Westman<br></strong>“Homemade almond milk, blueberries, avocados and probiotics from <a href=\"https://seed.com/\">SEED</a>, <a href=\"https://moonjuice.com/\">Moon Juice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thenueco.com/\">The Nue Co</a> – I like to add them to my morning smoothie, which is a simple way to make sure I'm giving my body what it needs.”</p>  <p><strong>Arthur de Villepin, gallerist<br></strong>“Lemons - to have in hot water every morning, Dijon mustard and then pecorino, pancetta and tomatoes – the ingredients for my favourite dish, pasta all'amatriciana. I like my food spicy, so I'll usually have a bottle of Tabasco hanging around as well.”</p>  <p><strong>Jake Tapper, CNN anchor and author<br></strong>“Hard-boiled eggs because they are the perfect snack food that's also healthy.”</p>  <p><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross, actress<br></strong>“<a href=\"https://www.santacruzorganic.com/products/lemonades\">Santa Cruz</a> organic lemonade, Président unsalted butter, Frank's RedHot sauce, olives and a gorgeous selection of lettuces and fresh veggies. For parsley or anything like that, I cut the bottoms off and keep them in water so basically my fridge has plants in it; there are flowering things everywhere. And I'm also obsessed with vanilla hemp milk.”</p>  <p><strong>Achille Salvagni, designer and architect&#xa0;<br></strong>“A bottle of chilled Chardonnay – I don't mind which label, I don't have a favourite – and avocado, which I eat every morning on a piece of toast with a drop of olive oil. That's been my signature breakfast for almost 10 years.”</p>  <p><strong>Thelma Golden, director of The Studio Museum in Harlem<br></strong>“Oatly oat milk, Trader Joe's pineapple juice, Olipop root beer and <a href=\"https://serengetiteas.com/\">Serengeti</a> chai tea. There are endless condiments, including Tamarind Oh! from Essie Spice that I use on everything from poultry to vegetables. I also have greens from the Harlem Farmers' Market, and there is always ice cream from <a href=\"https://www.sugarhillcreamery.com/\">Sugar Hill Creamery</a>. They once named a flavour for me – Golden Chai – and I'm hoping they'll bring it back.”</p>  <p><strong>Nicolas Gabard, founder of Husbands Paris<br></strong>“Cheese, to feed my stomach.&#xa0; It's shameful but I can't cook. So when I am alone at home, I have the small pleasure of watching an old film with good wine and cheese. I apologise for being so obviously French.”</p><p>Source:  2022 'What does an aesthete keep in the fridge?' FT.com 12 January.
