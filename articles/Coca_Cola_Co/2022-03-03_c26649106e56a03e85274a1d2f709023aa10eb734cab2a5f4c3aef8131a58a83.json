  "text": "<p>Too many still rely on buying permission to pollute through carbon offsets rather than changing how they source energy, says sustainable-investing advocate As You Sow. The nonprofit on Thursday issued its periodic report, “Road to Zero Emissions: 55 Companies Ranked on Net Zero Progress“.</p><p>The report grades major companies on their progress in aligning emissions reductions with the Paris Agreement goal of holding warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>“The next few years are critical in achieving emissions reductions and setting a less catastrophic path for the global climate,” said&#xa0;Danielle Fugere, president of&#xa0;As You Sow. “To address the current gap between goals and action,&#xa0;As You Sow's&#xa0;scorecard weights near-term, year-over-year greenhouse-gas emissions reductions as the largest scorecard component.</p><p>Of the 55 companies ranked, only three companies — Microsoft MSFT, PepsiCo. PEP, and Ecolab ECL — received an overall “A” grade, though some companies got higher marks for certain efforts. Only two companies, Google-parent Alphabet GOOGLGOOG and Apple AAPL, received an overall “B” grade.</p><p>As You Sow“Approximately 84% of the assessed companies received total scores of “D” or “F,” underscoring that we have a long way to go toward net-zero progress,”&#xa0;said&#xa0;David Shugar,&#xa0;As You Sow's&#xa0;climate initiative manager and lead report analyst.&#xa0;The group is usually busy ahead of proxy season, pushing for initiatives or board changes to favor climate-conscientious seats. Early this year, it played a part in moving Coca-Cola KOtoward more reusable bottles to cut down plastic waste.</p><p>Thursday's report also finds 64% of assessed companies are not yet reporting the full range of their Scope 3 emissions, which covers their supply chains, or those emissions often out of a company's direct control. Scope 1 emissions are those that a company controls, such as emissions from headquarters. Scope 2 are the emissions linked to the energy a company uses, such as the gasoline in a fleet of vehicles or the emissions of the electricity grid.</p><p>Microsoft said in 2020 it wants to clean up the carbon footprint at its own home base and throughout its supply chain, believing it can go “carbon negative” by 2030.</p><p>As You SowCarbon negativity is the reduction of a carbon footprint to less than neutral, with the net effect of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rather than adding it. Only a handful of companies have committed to net-negative or, as they sometimes put it, “climate-positive, greenhouse-gas emissions targets. Microsoft believes by 2050 it can remove all the carbon it has emitted since the company's 1975 founding.</p><p>Investors and businesses joining in on larger initiatives,&#xa0;including the Climate Action 100&#xa0;and the&#xa0;Science Based Targets initiative, which align polluting measures and disclosures, although on a voluntary basis, have highlighted the expectation that companies must take concrete action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>The As You Sow report also addresses the use of offsets to achieve reduction goals.</p><p>A carbon offset broadly refers to&#xa0;a reduction in GHG emissions or an increase in carbon storage, typically by buying someone else's excess government-issued allowance or through land restoration or the planting of trees.</p><p>As You SowAs You Sow and others argue that carbon offsets should not substitute for actual reduction measures in the company's value chain, for instance shifting from fossil fuel-based energy to renewable sources.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, one of As You Sow's lowest grades goes to electric-vehicle pioneer Tesla TSLA, whose revenue-generating profile has historically relied on selling its excess carbon credits, awarded because all of its production line is dedicated to zero-emission autos.</p><p>Read:Elon Musk invites UAW to hold union vote at Tesla</p><p>As You SowWhile 12 of the assessed companies have set net-zero goals across all scopes of emissions, none commits to avoiding the use of carbon offsets to achieve those goals.</p><p>“Carbon offsets cannot substitute for on-the-ground reductions by companies,”&#xa0;Shugar said.&#xa0;“To achieve net-zero emissions, companies must take action at the level of their own operations and supply chains. Purchasing carbon offsets&#xa0;will not solve&#xa0;the climate crisis.”</p>",
