  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  As a young Ph.D. student, Erika James wasn't sure she wanted to work in academia. Three decades later, she sits atop one of the nation's most prestigious business schools. </p><p>\n  In 2020 Dr. James became dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first woman and person of color to hold that post in Wharton's 140-year history. </p><p>\n  Her mother was an educator and her stepfather was a clinical psychologist. She received master's and doctoral degrees in organizational psychology at the University of Michigan, but said she didn't fully understand when applying to Ph.D. programs that they were largely intended to prepare students for a career in academia. </p><p>\n  \"I never saw myself as someone who was pursuing becoming a professor,\" she says. \"I really just wanted to pursue my interests.\" </p><p>\n  Dr. James turned down a number of consulting jobs after getting her Ph.D., based on the advice of a dissertation adviser. She didn't look back, becoming a professor and taking business-school leadership posts at the University of Virginia and Emory University. She started at Wharton in July. </p><p>\n  \"I said I would try it for a year,\" she says. \"Twenty-plus years later, I've really never had a desire to do anything else.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Lynn Wooten </p><p>\n  President, Simmons University </p><p>\n  Dr. James met Dr. Wooten when she began graduate school in 1991. They both showed up to the same statistics class and sat next to each other, beginning a decadeslong friendship. Their relationship transformed into a personal and professional partnership. The two collaborated on research and co-wrote the book \"Leading Under Pressure: From Surviving to Thriving Before, During, and After a Crisis.\" \"We literally refer to each other as sisters at this point,\" Dr. James says. \"She and I are on the phone, and I'm not exaggerating, every day.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  David Thomas </p><p>\n  President, Morehouse College </p><p>\n  Dr. James met Dr. Thomas at a conference in 1993 while she was a graduate student. He was a Harvard Business School professor and a beacon of success to students like her. Dr. Thomas became an important guide, helping her navigate the tenure process and teaching business students. At times their roles were reversed. Dr. James was still dean of Emory University's business school in Atlanta when Dr. Thomas became president of Morehouse College and moved to the city. This time, she introduced him to people and showed him around. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  E. Neville Isdell </p><p>\n  Former chief executive, Coca-Cola Co. </p><p>\n  Dr. James and Mr. Isdell met in 2015, after Dr. James began her tenure as dean of Emory University's business school. The two immediately clicked, she says, and the former Coca-Cola leader became \"a tremendous friend and supporter.\" They keep in touch via email, and Mr. Isdell often sends her articles related to her work. \"His approach to leadership and the way in which businesses can use its resources to have impact . . . really sparked a curiosity within me,\" Dr. James says. \"He is someone who pushed my thinking in ways that I hadn't anticipated.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Zander Lurie </p><p>\n  Chief executive, SurveyMonkey Inc. </p><p>\n  Dr. James first met Mr. Lurie in 2016 at SurveyMonkey's headquarters. She admires his humility as a leader and the value he places on his workers. \"People were always first for him when he was thinking about how to build and advance SurveyMonkey,\" she says. \"I saw him walk the talk every day.\" In 2018, Dr. James joined the board of directors of SurveyMonkey, and outside the boardroom Dr. James often seeks his insight to help guide her students. Those conversations \"inform how I think about preparing students for the modern business world,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
