  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Apollo Hires Former Amazon Executive for ESG Role  ----  By Laura Kreutzer",
  "text": "<p>    Apollo Global Management Inc. has hired former Amazon.com Inc. executive Carletta Ooton to bolster the firm's environmental, social and governance expertise, the latest in a series of high-profile ESG hires by the firm in recent months. </p><p>   Ms. Ooton will be head of ESG for private equity and an operating partner at Apollo's portfolio performance solutions group, helping the firm's portfolio companies integrate ESG into their operations. </p><p>   At Amazon, she served as a vice president of product assurance, risk and security and was instrumental in its sustainability efforts, including calculating the giant logistics organization's carbon footprint and helping to launch Amazon's Climate Pledge, according to a press release. Her last day at Amazon was Friday, she said in a LinkedIn post. </p><p>   Amazon co-founded the climate pledge in 2019 as a way to encourage businesses to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. </p><p>   Before Amazon, Ms. Ooton worked for Coca-Cola Co., where she led the development and execution of quality, safety and environmental policies and practices across the company, the release stated. </p><p>   Ms. Ooton is the third executive in an ESG or sustainability-focused role that Apollo has hired in recent months. </p><p>   Earlier this fall, the firm added Michael Kashani as head of ESG for its credit business and hired Dave Stangis as chief sustainability officer, a new role. Mr. Stangis founded impact advisory firm 21C Impact and earlier served as chief sustainability officer for Campbell Soup Co. Mr. Kashani previously served as head of ESG for portfolio management in the fixed-income unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset management arm, according to his LinkedIn profile. </p><p>   Apollo is among a number of private-markets firms adding ESG experts to their teams as investor scrutiny of corporate progress on ESG intensifies and as methods used to measure and manage ESG metrics expand. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Preeti Singh contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
