  "text": "<p>DoorDash will charge higher commissions to McDonald's restaurants starting next year for orders that keep a delivery driver waiting, the documents show.</p><p>DoorDash negotiated for each McDonald's to cover the cost of refunds caused by restaurant mistakes, one of the documents shows, such as when the kitchen forgets the french fries -- after guest complaints reach a certain threshold.</p><p>Some McDonald's franchisees raised concerns about the penalties tied to performance as they struggle with staffing shortages.</p><p>The pandemic ushered in record revenue for delivery apps, but making money off the service has been challenging. DoorDash and Uber Technologies Inc. have tried to maximize drivers' efficiency by matching them to restaurants closer to when orders are ready.</p><p>They have looked for ways to trim refunds during the crisis, including through new features that let customers break down items within a particular order so the apps aren't footing the entire bill for a missing Coke.</p><p>At the same time, the apps are under competitive pressure not to raise base rates for restaurants or pile on more charges to users.</p><p>Restaurants are trying to negotiate the best commission rates possible as delivery becomes a bigger part of their sales.</p><p>McDonald's unveiled the new deals with DoorDash and Uber Eats in November, without making the terms public, and asked franchisees to sign off on the contracts later.</p><p>Industry executives say McDonald's stands to gain from DoorDash's reduced commission rates while DoorDash can protect its margins on orders the restaurant delays or makes an error on.</p><p>DoorDash created a tiered rate system for McDonald's, one that applies to its DashPass subscription service, which offers discounts to users for a monthly fee, and a separate one for those outside the loyalty program.</p><p>DoorDash lowered the base commission rate McDonald's will pay on orders from nonsubscribers to 11.6%, the documents show, and the fee on orders from DashPass subscribers will be 14.1%.</p><p>The previous rate for both was 15.5%. McDonald's pays a higher commission on orders from DoorDash's monthly subscribers because those customers order frequently and spend more.</p><p>When a driver has to wait more than four minutes, the rates start to climb, reaching 17.6% on orders from non-DashPass subscribers that take more than seven minutes, the documents show.</p><p>The rate on DashPass-subscriber orders that make drivers wait more than seven minutes gradually rises to 20.1%. DoorDash can see couriers on the job via location services and starts the clock when they are roughly 80 feet away from the restaurant.</p><p>The wait-time commissions are slated to begin in 2023.</p><p>DoorDash declined to comment on the specifics of the McDonald's contract, but said variable commissions based on service help reduce courier wait times, boosting driver earnings and customer retention, and ultimately spurring more revenue for restaurants. It is unclear whether these terms will roll out more widely to other restaurants.</p><p>McDonald's said it was focused on making long-term, mutually beneficial deals with its delivery providers, and commission rates were one of several components considered with the agreements.</p><p>\"Delivery is one of the largest growth engines of the McDonald's business globally, and it's our goal to provide world-class customer experiences,\" the company said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
