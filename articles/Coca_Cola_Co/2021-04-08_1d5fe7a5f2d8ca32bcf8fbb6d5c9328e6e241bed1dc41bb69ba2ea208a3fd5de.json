  "text": "<p>Ridley declined to address whether he supports or opposes the Republican-backed law, which tightens some requirements against absentee voting in particular.</p><p>\"I don't think that my opinion on this legislation should shape discussion,\" he said. \"I just don't think that's going to be helpful to ultimately reaching a resolution.\"</p><p>Proponents of the legislation say it is needed to ensure election integrity. Opponents, chiefly Democrats, say it makes it more difficult for voters in underrepresented communities to cast ballots.</p><p>This Masters, which begins Thursday, comes on the heels of Major League Baseball's decision to pull its All-Star Game from the state in response to the law. Many of the state's biggest businesses, including Delta Air Lines Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., have expressed opposition to the legislation.</p><p>The statewide controversy has turned national, with President Biden previously saying he would strongly support a decision by MLB to move its game, which will now be played in Denver instead. Biden did not make a similar push to move the Masters, which unlike All-Star games is always played in this one place, saying Tuesday that it was \"up to the Masters.\"</p><p>The National Black Justice Coalition, an activist group, has been among those to call for the Masters to be moved or boycotted. Ridley said those actions can \"unfortunately\" impose the biggest burdens on the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"Voting is an essential, fundamental right in our society,\" he said. \"Anything that disadvantages anyone to vote is wrong and should be addressed.\"</p>",
