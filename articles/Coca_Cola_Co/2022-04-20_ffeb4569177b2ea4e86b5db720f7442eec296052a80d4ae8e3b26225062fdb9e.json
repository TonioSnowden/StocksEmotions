  "text": "<p>Having the same person hold both roles weakens the corporate governance structure, the group said in the shareholder measure published ahead of the company's April 30 shareholder meeting.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway's board opposes the measure and said that it believes Mr. Buffett should continue to fill both roles. After he departs, a board member who isn't part of management should become chair, the board said.</p><p>A representative from Berkshire wasn't immediately available for comment.</p><p>Calpers also co-sponsored a separate proposal, alongside pension funds in New Jersey and Quebec, asking Berkshire Hathaway to give shareholders more information on how it manages climate risks. \"In our view, the company's existing disclosures are insufficient,\" Calpers' filing said.</p><p>Calpers' long history of using its investment muscle to steer corporate governance includes a previous run-in with Mr. Buffett. In 2004 the pension fund unsuccessfully opposed his re-election to the board of Coca-Cola Co.</p><p>The move was part of a 2004 policy of withholding support for hundreds of board members who had authorized auditors to provide nonaudit services, such as tax advice. Good-governance advocates said that practice could lead to conflicts of interest.</p><p>Calpers ended up changing that policy to more closely target the audit firms themselves rather than the companies that use their services. Mr. Buffett stepped down from the Coca-Cola board in 2006, with the company citing increased demands on his time resulting from recent Berkshire acquisitions.</p><p>Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com</p><p>Calpers Plans to Vote to Replace Warren Buffett as Berkshire Hathaway's Chair</p>",
