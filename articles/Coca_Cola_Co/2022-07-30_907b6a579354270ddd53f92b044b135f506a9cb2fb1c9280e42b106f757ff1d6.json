  "text": "<p>   One of the world's biggest consumer marketers did something so unpopular and curiously timed this week that many speculated it must have been a stunt. </p><p>   Why else would anyone freeze sales of the Choco Taco? </p><p>   Unilever, the parent company of Klondike, blamed an \"unprecedented spike in demand\" and the pandemic supply chain for what it called \"a necessary but unfortunate\" decision to discontinue some of its products. \"Even a beloved item like Choco Taco,\" it said. </p><p>   A spokesperson for Klondike said killing the Choco Taco wasn't a ploy to sell more Choco Tacos. But within a few days of announcing its demise in the middle of summer, as social media was melting into a puddle of eulogies, the company said it was already \"exploring options to bring it back.\" </p><p>   Alan Drazen, a 68-year-old former Good Humor driver, created the novelty in 1983, when he was working at Jack &amp; Jill Ice Cream Co. He decided to use the annual post-summer lull for research and development. </p><p>   \"I have an idea,\" Mr. Drazen told his boss. </p><p>   \"What is it?\" </p><p>   \"An ice-cream taco.\" </p><p>   When it came to naming the product, the company had hired an advertising firm, but Mr. Drazen beat them to it. He blurted out two words that would change his life. </p><p>   Choco Taco. </p><p>   Mr. Drazen persuaded friends with ice cream trucks, and later Taco Bell, to stock the Choco Taco. </p><p>   Unilever bought the company that made Choco Tacos decades ago, and word of the dessert's fate reached its creator at the same time as millions of people who have eaten one. </p><p>   But a long tradition of fans bringing dead products back to life, from original-formula Coke to \"Family Guy,\" gives Mr. Drazen hope. \"I think they're seeing something they never expected,\" he said. </p><p>   He knows better than anyone how powerful that can be. </p><p></p>",
