  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>For our last “regular edition” before summer break, I thought it'd be interesting to hear from a seasoned Brussels operator, Luxembourg ambassador to the EU Georges Friden, who is bowing out after nearly a decade in the EU capital. His next move is to London, where he'll represent the Grand Duchy as of September. </p> <p>We'll also hear from the health commissioner about the dangers of monkeypox, amid a spike in cases in Europe.</p> <p>As for this newsletter, colleagues across Europe will take turns in writing a weekly edition through the month of August, coming to your inbox on Wednesdays. Normal daily service will resume from Monday August 29. </p> <h2>Liverpool, Coke and EU integration</h2> <p>A red mini-fridge branded with the Coca-Cola logo sits on Georges Friden's desk in Brussels. It's a parting gift from his staff, given that the American drink is his favourite, he says. </p> <p>Other favourites include Liverpool football club (as a child he didn't like the ostentatiously pro-German commentary during one match and decided to root for the other team, which happened to be Liverpool). He's also partial to European integration and the FT.</p> <p>“I am very constant in my preferences,” he said. </p> <p>Coming from a small country that was at the receiving end of Franco-German rivalry, Friden says he has always been “very sensitive to the fact that the EU has achieved an amazing transformation, crucial for the destiny of my country”. </p> <p>He described the pandemic as the biggest challenge of his years in Brussels.</p> <p>“The pandemic threatened an awful lot of things, including to tear solidarity apart, among citizens, companies, countries — I was unpleasantly surprised at how the national reflexes came back all over the union.”</p> <p>“The fact that the virus jeopardised decades of integration was a massive disappointment.”&#xa0;</p> <p>For Luxembourg, it was a “frightening experience” when Germany and Belgium closed their borders. </p> <p>“Without an open border we don't have a functioning healthcare system: 40 per cent of our workers cross borders every day. A solution was found for essential workers after a few months, but throughout the pandemic Luxembourg lived in permanent fear of its neighbours shutting down the borders.”</p> <p>So is Europe on the cusp of another such test, this time over energy? “I'm worried we might be,” he said, even as an agreement on voluntary gas cuts was found this week. “We are at a crucial point, will we learn from the pandemic and help each other if say, some countries will have to cut off parts of their industries?”</p> <p>Friden sees unity inside the EU still broadly holding but admits that “keeping everyone on the same page is a challenge and I suspect Russia will make attempts to divide the EU”.</p> <p>On Brexit, he said: “It was a huge disappointment, all that investment in building together and then having to take it all apart.”</p> <p>“Brexit caused the 27 to really value what they were doing together. The European Commission secured a lot of support for negotiations with London. The threat to EU integration never felt similar to what we went through during the pandemic.”</p> <p>If he had a magic wand and could implement one EU reform, it would be a real common migration policy. “The distrust among member states most affected and the ones farther away has not been overcome in all these years.” The experience with Ukrainian refugees hasn't really changed that, because they are seen as a different, temporary phenomenon. But he acknowledged that as the war wages on, it could turn into a more structural one. </p> <p>On Italy and a possible return of a financial crisis in the eurozone, Friden is quite confident that the measures taken to shore up the bloc's financial system after the last crisis means that this time round, the eurozone is better prepared. “I am among the optimists on that.”</p>  <h1>Chart du jour: Gazprom squeeze </h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/283f2ed2-0334-4507-a4f4-11c80be5991a\"><em>Read more here</em></a><em> about how Russia is further squeezing Europe with cuts in gas supplies that sent European gas prices soaring yesterday.</em></p> <h2>Monkeypox alert</h2> <p>Brussels wants EU health ministries to “mobilise now” and step up their response to the worsening outbreak of monkeypox in the union, as concern rises over the spread of the disease in Europe, writes <em><strong>Sam Fleming in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>Stella Kyriakides, the health commissioner, said monkeypox was unlikely to turn into a pandemic, but that one of the lessons from Covid-19 was the importance of acting early when confronted with a wave of infections. </p> <p>She told Europe Express that efforts needed to focus on raising awareness of the risks, working with member states on contact-tracing and improving availability of laboratory testing, as well as delivering doses of vaccine to member states. </p> <p>“We need information out there to make sure we stop the spread of this virus, which within the European region the WHO classes as high risk,” she said. </p> <p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/562fc24e-1b34-4ac6-a32a-42172a5f82b6\">last weekend said </a>the worldwide monkeypox outbreak was a “public health emergency of international concern”, putting it on par with diseases such as Covid-19, Ebola and polio.</p> <p>While overall global risk from monkeypox remained low, it was “high” in Europe, according to the WHO. Europe accounts for three-quarters of confirmed cases in 2022.</p> <p>The commission has already secured the purchase of more than 160,000 doses of Jynneos vaccine, funded by the EU budget, which will be donated to member states. In a letter to European health ministers seen by Europe Express, Kyriakides said there are now two additional joint procurement exercises in the works, for the purchase of further monkeypox vaccine doses from Bavarian Nordic as well as the antiviral Tecovirimat.</p> <p>The disease, which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and was first identified decades ago, has recently been detected in all inhabited continents. </p> <p>More than 16,000 confirmed monkeypox cases have been registered this year, according to the Geneva-based health body, mostly among men who have sex with men, but it warns that the disease could spread to other vulnerable groups. At least five fatalities have been reported in African nations this year.</p>  <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>Hungary's Viktor Orbán visits his Austrian counterpart in Vienna while the Hungarian foreign minister is in Moscow</p></li>  <li><p>Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visits Tehran</p></li> </ol>  <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Racist comments: </strong>Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán is facing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a47ae01-5ca2-44c0-bcde-701c7cf90258\">a growing international backlash</a> over inflammatory comments about race that led to the resignation of one of his close aides.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cutting off Russia: </strong>A rocket strike by Ukrainian forces yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f46dd483-4f13-4233-9a38-b8bf18b50874\">damaged a crucial route for Moscow</a> to supply its occupying forces in the Kherson region.</p></li> </ul><p>Source: Valentina Pop 2022 'Luxembourg ambassador bows out after nearly a decade in Brussels' FT.com 28 July.
