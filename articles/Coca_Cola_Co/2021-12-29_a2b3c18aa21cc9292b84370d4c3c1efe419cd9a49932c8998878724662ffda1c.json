  "text": "<p>Lex was not alone in falling for The Hut Group. Indeed, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88c9bc6b-92f5-4570-bd59-96f6ba7f29c9\">early prediction</a> of a successful initial public offering came good in spades: shares debuted up by nearly a third in September 2020.</p> <p>Incipient qualms about the online vendor of cosmetics and vitamins were also on the money. The elevated IPO price has since halved. Beauty, it turned out, was only skin deep. Transparency and corporate governance were in short supply. Plans to spin off various units laid bare a rather more rickety structure than investors had banked on.</p> <p>Part of THG's pitch had been its technology engine, a package of logistics, payments and websites that third parties such as Nestlé or Coca-Cola could avail themselves of for ecommerce.</p> <p>But that only contributed revenues of £85.8m, or less than a tenth of group sales, in the first half. Nearly all of that was cloud; just £18.3m — not even 2 per cent — came from the key commerce business.</p> <p>Chief executive Matt Moulding's plan was to spin out this unit, called THG Ingenuity. He appeared to strike gold in a deal with SoftBank that gave the Japanese investment group a call option to take a one-fifth stake in THG Ingenuity for $1.6bn, implying a valuation of heroic proportions.</p> <p>Lex was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8856db24-644b-47d2-8311-dcf9fc288b3a\">among the doubters</a> unable to make the numbers stack up, and was soon joined by others. A capital markets day shortly after, in early October, failed to mollify shareholders. Moulding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c2b7d1-1dea-4841-be90-f78858d6eeb4\">took further steps</a> to stem the decline, surrendering his golden share that allowed him to veto any unwanted bid and plotting a move from standard to a premium listing.</p> <p>The latter, which demands more corporate governance, was designed to restore confidence in what had been one of London's hottest stock market debutantes. But the 70 per cent drop in share price since its January listing means the group's entire market cap — £2.8bn — is less than the value ascribed to tiny THG Ingenuity by SoftBank. That may well quash SoftBank's desire to exercise its option, leaving THG far from sitting pretty.</p><p>Source:  2021 'THG: keep taking the vitamins' FT.com 29 December.
