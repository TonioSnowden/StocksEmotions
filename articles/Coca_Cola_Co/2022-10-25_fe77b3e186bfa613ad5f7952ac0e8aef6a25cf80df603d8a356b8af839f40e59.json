  "text": "<p>In Europe and the U.S., Coke is seeing signs that inflation is pushing consumers to change their buying habits, shifting to store-branded water and juice and shopping more in dollar stores, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday.</p><p>In a recession, consumers tend to try to reduce the amount they spend on each shopping trip, making affordable price points important, he said.</p><p>\"Around the world that's absolutely what we're pursuing,\" he said.</p><p>Coke is introducing packages at lower price points for consumers whose pocketbooks are squeezed by inflation. The new offerings include quarter-liter bottles and multi-packs with fewer cans in the U.S., refillable bottles in South Africa and new 750 mL and 350 mL bottles in Japan, company executives said.</p><p>U.S. and European business activity fell in October, pointing to a slowdown in U.S. and global growth, as higher prices and interest rates weigh on consumer demand, Europe continues its economic conflict with Russia and China faces headwinds.</p><p>Mr. Murphy said it is clear that a recession is coming but it isn't clear how consumers will respond.</p><p>\"We've got to have the ability to pivot and adapt as we learn on the fly as to how consumers will react,\" he said in an interview. He said the company would build on lessons from the past three years, when Covid-19 lockdowns closed restaurants, stadiums and movie theaters, forcing the beverage company to pivot.</p><p>Coke said it now expects organic revenue, a metric that strips out currency effects, acquisitions and divestitures, to increase 14% to 15% this year.</p><p>The company's global case volume increased 4% in the latest quarter, driven by strong international sales.</p><p>The sales gain comes even as Coca-Cola reported a significant impact from the stronger dollar, which dented revenue by 8 percentage points. The company said organic revenue was up 16% year over year.</p><p>Overall for the quarter, Coca-Cola posted a net income of $2.8 billion, or 65 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, Coca-Cola said adjusted earnings were 69 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been forecasting adjusted earnings of 64 cents a share.</p><p>Revenue came in at $11.1 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $10.5 billion.</p><p>â€”Sabela Ojea contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at Jennifer.Maloney@wsj.com</p><p>Coca-Cola Raises Outlook as Sales Jump 10%</p>",
