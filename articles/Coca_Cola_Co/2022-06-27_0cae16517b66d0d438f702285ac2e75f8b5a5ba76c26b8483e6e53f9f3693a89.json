  "text": "<p>Iconic enough, in fact, for an anniversary reissuance called Atari: Recharged, on Microsoft's MSFT Xbox, Sony's JP:6758 PlayStation, and Nintendo's JP:7974 Switch.</p><p>\"I think we stood for innovation. And also we were the genesis story. So, you always have a hallowed position when you're the first,\" Bushnell said to Rosen, recalling the writings of the German philosopher considered by many as the \"artists' philosopher\" in the observation of an irrational world.</p><p>Read: Life isn't a game, but it is game-like—and playing video games can make you smarter about money</p><p>\"We had no money, no factories, no market presence, the only thing we had was creativity,\" he said.</p><p>Before June 27, 1972, the company was named Syzygy Engineering. Bushnell and partner Ted Dabney developed and released \"Computer Space\" in 1971, which was considered to be the first cabinet-based video arcade game. The game, however, stood out as an imposing oddity in arcades back then among the pinball machines, mechanical shooting and driving games, and air hockey tables.</p><p>Read: 'Stranger Things 4' product visibility is worth up to $25 million for Coke, Jif and other brands</p><p>It wasn't until Atari released the extremely simple to understand \"Pong\" in 1972, in which players competed in an almost computer version of air hockey, that electronic gaming had its mainstream launch. That was followed by home versions from Atari and other manufacturers, creating the home game console market, which Atari came to dominate for several years with its iconic Atari 2600 console.</p><p>In the video arcades, Atari ran into serious competition from the Japanese company Taito Corp., when Taito released the wildly-popular \"Space Invaders\" in 1978. Atari fired back, with the vector-graphics video game \"Asteroids\" in 1979.</p><p>Perhaps more important, Atari had a pop-culture appeal that Taito didn't, as evidenced in the futuristic product placements in movies like \"Blade Runner,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" and \"Ready Player One.\"</p><p>Read: Think twice before you trade in your old smartphone or game console — you could make more money 'upcycling' on resale sites</p><p>Also, before Atari was Atari, Bushnell and Dabny's \"Computer Space\" even made a cameo appearance in the 1973 dystopic thriller \"Soylent Green\"as a rich person's toy in a world suffering from ecological collapse, extreme poverty, food shortages set in — no kidding — 2022.</p><p>Atari turns 50, and the godfather of video games talks about how to change the world</p>",
