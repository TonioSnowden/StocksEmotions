  "title": "A Holiday Gift Guide for Food and Drink Lovers: 8 Ideas Under $300 (and a Couple of Splurges); This is no time to get sensible with your gifting, especially when it comes to feeding loved ones hungry for joy, or even a dash of debauchery. Consider these 10 highly palatable presents—including a special-delivery breakfast in bed.",
  "text": "<p>HAVEN'T WE EARNED some good times? Can't you just taste it, actually? Like they sing in the old TV commercial, \"I'd like to buy the world a Coke, and keep it company\"—only this year, make it a bottle of excellent Champagne and uncork it along with a generous serving of Swiss chocolates. Even the ice cubes in the cocktails should elicit cries of delight (let's bring back that somewhat unfamiliar sound). The gifts assembled here aren't necessarily expensive, but each one is rich in its own way. Keep the spirits high—not to mention flowing—and feed the jolly Falstaff in all your guests and giftees this holiday season.</p><p>Joyous, No-Fuss Cocktails in a Bottle</p><p>One look at the tiger roaring on the label, and you know this drink will be fierce. Created by tiki expert Shannon Mustipher for the Livewire line of premixed drinks by bartenders, Holy Tyger is a dynamite whiskey sour that crackles with tropical personality, framed by lime, coconut and lemongrass. Unlike the meek canned spritzers that dominate ready-to-drink shelves, this bottle is a wholehearted, big, boozy endorsement of escapism and joie de vivre. Holy Tyger cocktail, $25 for a bottle that serves 6, livewiredrinks.com</p><p>A Poultry Puzzle Like No Other</p><p>Yakitori, the seemingly simple Japanese preparation of skewered, grilled chicken, is actually a complex art: A skilled butcher can create dozens of distinct cuts from a single bird. MegaHouse's 38-piece 3D Chicken Kaitai Puzzle lets kids and adults build a chicken from that multitude of morsels—a delightful diversion for cozy December afternoons by the fire. Other puzzles in the series include a pig, a steer and, should sushi sound more appetizing, a tuna. $20, bigbadtoystore.com</p><p>A Deliciously Motivating Bible for Bread Bakers</p><p>Whether your loved one already has sourdough starter burbling in the kitchen or simply loves top-notch loaves, \"Bread Book: Ideas and Innovations From the Future of Grains, Flour, and Fermentation\" (Lorena Jones Books, December, $40) is an irresistible invitation to put hands to dough. From Chad Robertson, co-founder of Tartine Bakery, with co-author Jennifer Latham, the crystal-clear recipes—from an iconic country bread to seeded gluten-free multigrain, plus treats like brisket sandwiches and green-garlic pizza—inspire rather than intimidate.</p><p>Our Favorite Chocolate-and-Much-More Box</p><p>Since 1955, André's Confiserie Suisse has been quietly producing outstanding chocolates and candies a long way from Switzerland, in Kansas City, Mo. The family business offers a comprehensive primer in its particular pleasures with the Swiss Heritage Gift Box, including regional treats like a wedge of Engadiner nut torte and Leckerli spice cookies. Chocolate abounds, of course, coating almonds and caramels (dusted with alpine salt) and hazelnuts and nougat in a (theoretically) shareable bar. $45,   andreschocolates.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal; Lucy Han (illustration)</p><p>A Year of Whiskey With a Bit of Bite</p><p>Portland, Ore.-based Westward Whiskey is known for its resolutely local approach: American single malts made with two-row barley grown and malted in the Northwest and flavorful strains of yeast typically used in beer making. A gift membership to the Westward Whiskey Club ($360, westwardwhiskey.com) includes four bottles of limited-production, richly regional whiskey per year. And what better sipping companion than a pup who peers up from the glass as he cools it? A duo of Bulldog Novelty Ice Molds ($22, williams-sonoma.com) lets dog lovers toast together. </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Sharon Ryan; Lucy Han (illustration)</p><p>Tea Time and an Exuberant Classic Read Care of Tilda Swinton</p><p>Life's been hard. Encourage a bibliophile to revisit its festive side with 1955's \"Auntie Mame,\" about a free-spirited eccentric tasked with raising an orphaned nephew. One Grand Books in Narrowsburg, N.Y.—whose selection is based on notable people's lists of top-10 reads—has bundled this favorite of actress Tilda Swinton with her preferred tea (smoky Lapsang Souchong) in a special tote bag as a WSJ exclusive gift. \"The book is…so much about a kind of a proper liberal spirit,\" Ms. Swinton said, \"and it feels like it's time to remind people of what that is.\" $40, grandjournal.net </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal; Lucy Han (Illustration)</p><p>A Savory Breakfast They Can Enjoy Between the Sheets</p><p>Nothing's as luxurious as breakfast in bed, but someone has to get up and make it. This holiday, outsource the task to Hudson Valley Fisheries, the sustainable steelhead trout farm in upstate New York. The Trout Lovers Holiday Kit includes a hot-smoked trout fillet, silky cold-smoked lox, rillettes, made with herbs and sour cream, and a creamy goat's milk spread—plus adorable whale-shaped spreaders. Just add coffee, maybe bagels. Shipping begins Nov. 22 and is free within 150 miles. $65, hudsonvalleyfisheries.com</p><p>Our Wine Columnist's Pick for a Champagne to Ring in the New Year</p><p>A great Champagne producer rarely changes its non-vintage cuvée—the signature of the house. So when Champagne Louis Roederer stopped making its highly regarded Brut Premier, it was news. The bottling that replaced it bears the name Louis Roederer Collection 242, this being the house's 242nd blend, produced primarily from the 2017 harvest with wines from earlier vintages. Rich and creamy with notes of hazelnut and toast and a satiny finish, this Champagne is new, festive and, thankfully, a decided upgrade. $55, morrellwine.com</p><p>Chic Alternatives to Christmas Crackers</p><p>Christmas crackers are good, raucous fun: Tug the ends of a pretty parcel and—pop!—out tumble tiny presents and a silly paper crown. These table gifts from UK-based Toast dispense with the pop. Quiet awe is more the vibe as each guest unties the furoshiki (wrapping cloth) to find a joke, an anagram and the obligatory crown, plus some small, exquisite thing—perhaps a felt finger puppet or an origami star made by a Nepalese Fair Trade group—designed expressly to delight. Furoshiki Table Gifts, $65 for six, us.toa.st</p><p>A Big-Ticket Gift for a Cook Who Prizes Orderliness</p><p>For the Marie Kondo acolyte on your list who lives to organize kitchen cabinets, Ensembl offers the Classic 4 set of stackable pots and pans. The 2.5- and 3.5-liter fully-clad stainless-steel pots, stockpot and removable strainer nest with breathtaking efficiency thanks to removable handles and lids with knobs that lie flat for storage. For recipients who want to offload their old pots, Ensembl actually facilitates donation and recycling. Neat. (Midnight Nov. 26 to Nov. 29, 20% off with code BLACKFRIDAY_20.) $612, getensembl.com</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
