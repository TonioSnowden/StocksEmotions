  "text": "<p>Regarding the article by Patrick Temple-West and Kiran Stacey, “Moderna resists investor call to cut jab prices” (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3747fed-ce48-48f5-b564-7c0a21aa378e\">Report</a>, December 29), it makes sense for drug producers of any type to sell their products at lower prices in developing countries as long as they can prevent such products from seeping back into the “grey market” in wealthy countries. </p> <p>Moderna has the additional concern of not losing its technological secrets to other producers.</p> <p>If Moderna cannot produce enough at its facilities in the US to meet international demand, it should license production in existing facilities in developing countries. </p> <p>To protect its technology it could follow the Coca-Cola approach. Coca-Cola has bottlers around the world but its secret formula never leaves the US. </p> <p>Perhaps Moderna could produce a key ingredient in the US to be shipped to licensees in developing countries for final formulation. </p> <p>This would ease any production bottlenecks in the US. Grey marketing into wealthy countries could be reduced by special packaging and labelling indicating that doses are only for distribution in developing countries.</p> <p><strong>Bruce Couchman</strong> <br><em>Ottawa, ON, Canada</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Moderna should consider the Coca-Cola sales model' FT.com 4 January.
