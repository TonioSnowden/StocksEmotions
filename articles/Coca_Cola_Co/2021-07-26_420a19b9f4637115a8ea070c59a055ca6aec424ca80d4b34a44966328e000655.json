  "text": "<p>When I Stephanie Boyce was working as a postwoman in Buckinghamshire, she often saw commuter trains heading into London. “I would look up and think ‘I will be on that train one of these days,'” she says of that time in her late teens when she was “muddling through”, trying to work and study.&#xa0;</p> <p>Her efforts paid off. Boyce, 49, has become the first president of colour in the almost 200-year history of the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents 200,000 solicitors. She is the sixth female president.&#xa0;</p> <p>She plans to be a force for change at the Law Society. Sitting in one of its oak-panelled rooms in Chancery Lane, Boyce says: “I've long spoken about the fact . . . that I would like to leave the profession <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3381e98e-d213-451e-ba23-56b34a3998da\">more diverse and inclusive</a> than the one I entered.</p> <p>“There is absolute, growing social opportunity in this profession, but we are acutely aware that more needs to be done. We cannot just have diversity — we must have inclusion as well. There is no point giving someone a seat at the table if you don't allow their voice to be heard.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Women now represent 31 per cent of partners in large private practice law firms and black, Asian and minority ethnic solicitors represent 7 per cent of partners despite making up 21 per cent of the profession.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last year the Legal Services Board, the sector's regulator, concluded in a <a href=\"https://legalservicesboard.org.uk/state-of-legal-services-report-2020\">hard-hitting report</a> that a “step change” was needed to make entry into the law easier. It said the profession had a persistent lack of diversity in hiring, retention and career progression, with a preference for “elite” educational institutions which hindered those from disadvantaged backgrounds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Boyce, the child of a single parent from an Afro-Caribbean working-class home, grew up on a council estate in Buckinghamshire. At 12, she emigrated to live on a military base in upstate New York as her stepfather was in the US Air Force. She was struck by the inequality and poverty in the US: “I would just be overwhelmed by the injustices as I saw it . . . Having little or no rights because of either your low socio-economic status or because of the colour of your skin.”</p> <p>When she returned to the UK at 19, her high school diploma was not recognised by British universities. She worked as a postwoman and later in a railway ticket office as she studied at a local college, then went on to a law and politics degree at London Guildhall University.</p> <p>In a profession where personal connections are influential, landing a job was hard. “I didn't have access to those networks . . . that the information, the sponsors, the mentors and the work experience is drawn from.”&#xa0;</p> <p>She made many applications, and her birth father, who worked at the local magistrates' court, gave out her CV to local solicitors. She eventually got a job at a Buckinghamshire law firm, where she qualified in 2002.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since then she has worked mainly as an in-house legal counsel in organisations including the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.</p> <p>“Social mobility is an absolute must,” she says. “I have long spoken about my own situation. Some people ask me why I talk about it. I'm not embarrassed. It's important that people appreciate and realise that coming from a non-traditional background, from a low socio-economic starting position, that actually you can still reach the top of your profession and you can, having reached there, make a difference. ”</p> <p>In 1990 there were 709 ethnic minority solicitors in England and Wales, compared with 20,675 in 2019. In 1978, 2,988 women held a solicitors' practising certificate, compared with 75,764 in 2019.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Since 1990, women have represented more than 60 per cent of new entrants as solicitors, but career progression is a challenge. “Those numbers are not translating into senior positions,” she says.&#xa0;</p> <p>She also points to <a href=\"https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/en/topics/research/race-for-inclusion-the-experiences-of-black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-solicitors\">Law Society research</a> on the experience of Bame lawyers which has identified issues around law firm recruitment practices, work allocation and inclusive culture. “If you come from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background you earned less per hour than your white colleagues, left the profession two years earlier than your white colleagues and you were more likely to be subjected to harassment and bullying and discrimination . . . So there are some real stark issues there.”</p> <p>She has had to battle against negative perceptions. “A recruitment agent said to me I'd never get into the City because I hadn't trained in the City, I hadn't worked in the City . . . She told me my salary expectation was unrealistic and it was never going to happen. Well I ditched her and got a new one [headhunter] and I ended up with my first job in the City,” she laughs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Boyce stood for election as Law Society vice-president four times until she was voted in. “Some people said to me: ‘Stephanie you are embarrassing yourself, go home and rest.' But I would have kept going a fifth or a sixth time if that's what it took because such was my belief in my ability to do the role and that I was just as capable and just as qualified,” she says.</p> <p>The legal profession is changing. Elite City firms Linklaters, Herbert Smith Freehills and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/551e9115-42e6-4aeb-8924-d2ce5d6ff73f\">elected senior female leaders</a>. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, many law firms have made diversity and inclusion a priority.&#xa0;</p> <p>Magic circle firms such as Clifford Chance — which has 26 per cent female partners and 8 per cent Bame partners in its London office — have set new targets. Clifford Chance has committed to at least 40 per cent female partners by 2030 and has adopted minority ethnic targets for the US and UK for 15 per cent of new partners by 2025.&#xa0;</p> <p>In-house teams at large companies such as Coca-Cola and NatWest are setting minimum diversity requirements for the panels of the external law firms they use.</p> <p>Aside from improving diversity and inclusion, Boyce's priorities include helping the legal profession <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12837f33-9c30-4588-8948-56736ac130f2\">recover after the pandemic</a>. Lawyers relying on legal aid to represent defendants have seen their incomes squeezed after the numbers of crown court trials fell last year because of Covid-19.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another focus is mental wellbeing. She points out that lawyers, particularly younger solicitors, have seen additional strain on their mental health during the pandemic and missed out on vital supervision and training.</p> <p>She also wants to send out a message that there is growing opportunity: “Determination and resilience has been the absolute driving force for me. The ability to continue when people have said no or told me I couldn't, to keep going because I absolutely believe that every door is open if you push,” she says.</p><p>Source: Jane Croft 2021 'The Law Society president on promoting diversity in an elite profession' FT.com 26 July.
