  "text": "<p>Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. reported higher quarterly sales as the global soda giants pushed through price increases but also felt the squeeze of higher costs for commodities and transportation.</p><p>Coke's organic revenue increased 9% in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from a year before, driven by a 10% increase in prices. Net revenue at PepsiCo, which also sells Frito Lays snacks and other foods, rose 11.9% with a 7% increase in prices. Organic revenue strips out currency swings as well as acquisitions or divestitures.</p><p>Both companies said inflationary pressures hurt their profits as costs rose for trucking, agricultural commodities and packaging. Coke's operating income fell 28% in the quarter; PepsiCo's operating profit fell 9%. Still, the results were better than Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Coke said the fourth quarter of 2021 was the first period since the pandemic's start in which the volume of its sales in restaurants and other eat-in venues was ahead of 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 shut restaurants, bars, sports stadiums and movie theaters around the world.</p><p>Hugh Johnson, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, said he is preparing for the possibility that cost pressures could continue into 2023. Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta added that recent price increases haven't turned away consumers. \"We have consumers following us in spite of higher prices,\" he said. </p><p>For 2022, Coke it expects organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%. PHOTO: GABBY JONES for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Coke and PepsiCo, two of the world's biggest advertisers, said they ramped up marketing spending during the most recent quarter. Coke, an Olympic sponsor, has been running an Olympics-themed marketing campaign in China, though not in the U.S. or other markets. PepsiCo boosted marketing in the quarter around the National Football League ahead of the Super Bowl.</p><p>Like other consumer-goods companies and manufacturers, the two rivals have faced higher prices for everything from the sugar that goes in their drinks to the aluminum that they use for cans to the costs of shipping their products around the world. U.S. inflation accelerated to a 7.5% annual rate in January, rising to a four-decade high, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p><p>\"We're obviously facing supply chain disruptions,\" such as finding enough truck drivers, Mr. Johnston said in an interview. \"The good news for us is because we've continued to invest so much behind our brands and because we've been innovating so successfully, it does give us the pricing power to pass along those costs.\"</p><p>Mr. Laguarta said on a call with analysts that in recent months, PepsiCo has seen some improvements in its supply chain throughout North America.</p><p>For 2022, Coke said it expects organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%. It forecast adjusted earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% from 2021, excluding currency swings.</p><p>PepsiCo forecast 6% organic revenue for 2022 growth and an 8% increase in core earnings per share, excluding currency swings.</p><p>Jacob Gallagher contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com</p><p>Coke and PepsiCo Post Big Sales Gains on Big Price Increases</p>",
