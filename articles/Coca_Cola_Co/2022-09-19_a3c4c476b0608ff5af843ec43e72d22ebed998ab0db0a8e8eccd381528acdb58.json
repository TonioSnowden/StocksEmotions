  "title": "Welcome to the World's Oddest Pot Party, Thrown By the Local Police; Maryland police set up Green Labs to sharpen their field sobriety skills, and show marijuana enthusiasts how much it impairs driving",
  "text": "<p>Soon the aroma of weed filled a white tent. A clutch of police officers stood watching.</p><p>The vibe was chill. The police supplied chips for the munchies and pizza for dinner. Their purpose, though, was sober: to show officers what marijuana impairment looks like, and the stoners how the drug can mess with their driving.</p><p>The police call it a green lab. Participants have two 30-minute periods to get high. After each one, they are ushered into classrooms for a battery of field sobriety tests, such as walking in a straight line—or trying to.</p><p>Savoring a joint inside the tent, Tiara Artis, 29 years old, said she was happy to do her part. Like her fellow participants, she has a state-issued medical marijuana card, which makes it legal for her to consume pot.</p><p>Ms. Artis said she had another reason for showing up: \"Honestly, just for the opportunity to smoke in front of the cops without anything happening to me,\" she said. \"It's a little strange, but I'm also used to doing strange things because I'm a strange person.\"</p><p>Montgomery County was the first police department in the U.S. to hold a green lab, in 2018, according to police officials there. The recent one was the county's ninth. Law-enforcement agencies in Seattle and Ohio recently launched similar programs.</p><p>In Maryland, where medical marijuana has been legal since 2014, voters will decide in November whether to legalize recreational pot use. As more states move to legalize pot, local officials are concerned that more stoned motorists will take to the roads.</p><p>It is illegal to drive while impaired by marijuana, but there isn't any widely accepted standard for assessing pot impairment, as there is with alcohol. In some states, laws say drivers can't have any THC—the psychoactive compound in cannabis—in their systems, while others set allowable levels. Maryland has no such law.</p><p>\"It's really important that our officers can be able to look at that person and say, OK, I think this is cannabis, and I think it's affecting them to the point where they can't operate a motor vehicle safely,\" said Officer Jayme Derbyshire, who coordinates Montgomery County's green lab program.</p><p>She said the lab doesn't aim to get anyone super-stoned, since those are easy calls for officers. Rather, participants are encouraged to consume as they typically do.</p><p>Jesse Levin, who brought his bong, said he found it impossible to consume normally because he never does so around the police. The 25-year-old pumped the Grateful Dead through earbuds, while trying, he said, to \"just enjoy it instead of being worried about how weird it is.\"</p><p>When Officer Derbyshire and Capt. David McBain, then a lieutenant, first pitched the idea years ago, the police brass weren't entirely sold. Capt. McBain said they thought it might just turn into a big party.</p><p>The program has safeguards, he said. Participants are picked up and dropped off at home, though some have asked to go to a bar afterward. County buildings are smoke-free, so the toking takes place outside. The police don't provide marijuana—a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law—although participants are reimbursed up to $60.</p><p>At the inaugural green lab, officers learned that showing up in their uniforms could be a major buzz kill. A young participant \"went into complete shock\" at the sight of a couple dozen uniformed officers, said Officer Derbyshire. \"She was in tears within seconds and went and locked herself in a bathroom stall. It took a few minutes to get her out.\"</p><p>Several participants at the recent edition said they didn't just use marijuana regularly, they worked at dispensaries. They said they had no doubt pot can impair drivers and that users have a responsibility to consume safely. They also said they wanted to show the police that it's possible to medicate without becoming intoxicated.</p><p>Dispensary worker Deeanna Schultz, 33, said her participation baffled some friends. \"Some people are like, whoa, why are you helping the cops figure out what they're looking for?\" she said.</p><p>Wendy Diehl, 45, said she felt \"overmedicated\" after her second session. \"Pretty stony, pretty psychoactive, you know, enjoying the moment, feeling creative,\" she said.</p><p>In a classroom, she wobbled while walking in a line and held her arms out to steady herself. She had difficulty focusing both eyes on a close-up object, and her eyelids fluttered—both signs of pot use, said Kraig Webb, the officer assessing her.</p><p>Officer Webb said he found the session helpful, if somewhat mind-blowing. \"Never in a million years would I have imagined that we'd have a tent at the back of the police academy and people are back there smoking,\" he said.</p><p>Khiry Maxberry, 26, had a go at a driving simulator after smoking a blunt. He reacted far too slowly when a virtual pedestrian stepped onto the imaginary road.</p><p>Later while smoking a second blunt, he also drank a rum and Coke, which the police offered because mixing pot and alcohol is common. Back in the classroom, he faltered on the sobriety tests. Counting out loud, he jumped from 16 to 19.</p><p>\"There's definitely impairment,\" observed Jeff Choma, a Maryland State Police first sergeant who is a drug-recognition expert and offered tips to officers attending as students.</p><p>At night's end, Mr. Maxberry, who said he never drives soon after smoking, described the experience as \"laughable, but for that matter, on the other end of the spectrum, it shows the importance of it.\"</p><p>He continued riffing, then paused. \"I kind of lost my train of thought right there,\" he said, laughing.</p><p>Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com</p><p>Welcome to the World's Oddest Pot Party, Thrown By the Local Police</p>",
