  "title": "Metro Money:  Fast Lane to New Yorkers' Fridges  ----  By Anne Kadet",
  "text": "<p>   My doorman and I were gawking at the full bag of groceries that had just been dropped at my building lobby by Gorillas -- a new service promising delivery in 10 minutes or less. </p><p>   \"It actually took eight minutes,\" I told him. He shook his head. \"That's awesome!\" </p><p>   It really is. And Gorillas, which launched here May 30, is just one of several instant-grocery services operating in New York City. I recently tested three including JOKR, which launched June 3, and Fridge No More, which launched last October. </p><p>   My conclusion? Whether you need a full grocery delivery or just a carton of milk for the pancake batter you've already started, you can't go wrong with any of the three. They all offer a user-friendly app, no minimum delivery, decent prices and service that lives up to their speed guarantees. </p><p>   Gorillas' average delivery time over three orders was 7.5 minutes. Fridge No More, which promises 15-minute delivery, averaged 9 minutes. My single order from JOKR, which also promises 15-minute delivery, came in 13 minutes. </p><p>   While Gorillas was the speed leader, it's also the only one charging a delivery fee -- a flat $1.80 per order. Chief of Staff Ashwin Wadekar says his company's 10-minute promise is a differentiator for which locals are willing to pay. \"New Yorkers always care about five minutes or 10 minutes,\" he says. </p><p>   I compared prices from all three services on 33 items I typically buy from my local Key Food supermarket. Gorillas had the lowest price most often, but in every case, the total bill was similar to what I'd pay at the store. </p><p>   I also like that all three services directly employ their order pickers and couriers, and provide paid time off and health insurance. They also provide their couriers with pedal-assist bikes or electric scooters and uniforms. </p><p>   The three disappointed when it came to selection, however. Unlike a supermarket, which typically stocks at least 10,000 different products, the instant-delivery services generally stock 2,000 to 3,000 different items. And they seem to favor the premium-organic-artisanal crowd. </p><p>   Gorillas offered soy milk, oat milk, and a dizzying 15 varieties of almond milk, for example, but no half-and-half. Fridge No More offered cherries, but only an organic variety that cost $7.79 a pound. JOKR carried a $16 12-ounce bag of locally roasted Cafe Grumpy coffee but not my cheap favorite, Cafe Bustelo. </p><p>   All three services said they vary their product selection by neighborhood based on customer feedback and are constantly updating to satisfy local preferences. </p><p>   In Manhattan's Tribeca, high-end Olipop soda was selling well, for example, so JOKR expanded the selection of premium sodas available in that neighborhood, says Zach Dennett, the company's U.S. co-founder. Meanwhile, around Union Square 30 blocks north, Coke was selling well, so the company increased the area's selection of mainstream sodas. </p><p>   If I had to pick one of the three, I'd likely go with Gorillas, and not just because it was faster, cheaper in many cases and carried more of my favorite products. </p><p>   It was also the most fun. Two of my orders included a free chocolate bar from a local candy maker; another came with a complimentary bottle of fancy hibiscus ice tea. And I had a nice chat with a Gorilla customer-experience rep who reached out by email and, after hearing my rant, promised to stock half-and-half. </p><p>   So how do these services pull it off? </p><p>   The secret to their delivery speed is the neighborhood hubs they're opening in storefronts throughout the city. Roughly the size of a 7-Eleven, the hubs function like miniature Amazon warehouses. Inside, pickers assemble incoming orders -- typically in under three minutes -- then hand the bags off to the couriers. </p><p>   Each hub serves a small area, usually stretching less than a mile in every direction. I tried biking the 0.7-mile route from the nearest Gorillas hub on Atlantic Avenue to my apartment building in Brooklyn Heights, and despite the heavy traffic made it home and pushed my own buzzer in 4.5 minutes flat. Speedy delivery may be hard to pull off, but it's no miracle. </p><p>   As for the economics, the services say one reason they can keep prices down, deliver the goods and still make a profit is their relatively low real-estate costs. Because their hubs carry a spare selection and provide no space for customers or cashiers, sales per square foot are more than double that of a typical supermarket, says Pavel Danilov, Fridge No More co-founder and chief executive. </p><p>   I will for sure be using instant delivery again. And, of course, I'm feeling guilty about it. Won't these services put the city's mom-and-pop groceries out of business? </p><p>   I asked the three companies if their services are a bodega killer. </p><p>   Mr. Wadekar at Gorillas said his service is competing with supermarkets. Mr. Dennett at JOKR said his company's target is Amazon. Mr. Danilov at Fridge No More had the most passionate response: \"We are not trying to kill anyone! We just want to bring more value and convenience to customers.\" </p><p>   The next day, I realized I had forgotten to buy half-and-half. Fridge No More had a carton at my door in seven minutes. Yes, I have met the real bodega killer, and it is me. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   anne.kadet@wsj.com </p><p></p>",
