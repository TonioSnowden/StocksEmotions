  "text": "<p>Kimpton is among a growing list of brands, from car companies to meal-kit makers, putting mental wellness front and center in their marketing. As the issue is increasingly destigmatized -- with celebrities and athletes openly discussing their own mental health -- companies are seeing an opportunity to connect with consumers.</p><p>Laura Simpson, chief intelligence officer at ad giant McCann Worldgroup, said the Covid-19 pandemic played a n significant role in boosting mental-health awareness. \"That was the straw that broke the camel's back of finally making us have proper conversations about mental health,\" she said.</p><p>Coca-Cola Co.'s Powerade is currently running a series of TV commercials that tell viewers \"pause is power.\"</p><p>In one spot featuring gymnast Simone Biles, Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte and British diver Tom Daley, Ms. Biles -- who withdrew from some competitions during last year's Tokyo Games because she wasn't in the right mental place to continue -- tells reporters during a news conference that she is taking a break. She is then seen getting a manicure.</p><p>Ms. Biles has been one of the highest-profile athletes -- a list that also includes tennis star Naomi Osaka and former swimmer Michael Phelps -- to open up about mental health in recent years.</p><p>\"Sometimes you've got to stop to be an actual human,\" Ms. Biles said in the commercial, as a manicurist paints over images of a goat on her fingernails.</p><p>General Motors Co. plans to launch a social-media campaign next month that shows influencers encouraging drivers to get their stress out before getting behind the wheel. GM said it decided to take a deeper look at the rise in anxiety and stress partly after seeing an alarming rise in traffic fatalities during the pandemic. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more people died in motor-vehicle crashes in the first nine months of last year than in any similar period since 2006.</p><p>GM said an online poll of nearly 3,000 American drivers conducted by McCann Worldgroup -- a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. -- found that a majority of respondents said they can remember a time when they cried in their cars, while a third said they have had to pull over because they felt too emotional to drive.</p><p>\"High levels of stress and emotions can be a significant cause of distraction for drivers,\" said Deborah Wahl, GM's global chief marketing officer.</p><p>Earlier this year, GM showed off a self-driving electric concept car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, whose seats feature biometric sensors that monitor a person's fatigue level. The Cadillac-branded car, which doesn't have a steering wheel, can display soothing colors, play calming sounds and emit relaxing scents, GM said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
