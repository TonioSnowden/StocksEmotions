  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Maybe a New $100 Coin  For When Inflation Returns",
  "text": "<p>   Regarding the letters \"On the Increasing Irrelevance of U.S. Coins\" (Jan. 14): Our coins are worthless and should be in $1 and $2 denominations because the value of these coins would pay for coin things, like a Coke or candy bar. But may I also suggest a $5 coin? The Swiss franc is worth more than a U.S. dollar and the 5 franc coin is minted in a large size with actual heft, a coin one wants to carry and spend, and something Mr. Scrooge would gleefully stack. It feels like money. </p><p>   But letter writer Peter V. Mini is mistaken. I have discussed our unique sales-tax mechanism with many citizens of the \"civilized\" high-VAT countries and all agreed that they would trade the convenience of VAT (or sales tax) inclusion in prices for a lower rate of less than 10%. Seeing the sales tax added at the end of each purchase is a regular reminder to the consumer of how much they pay and an incentive on tax raisers to keep rates low. </p><p>    Colin Kuester </p><p>   Bainbridge Island, Wash. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    I plan to introduce the 0.9 cent coin that would be usable when one buys gas. </p><p>    Carl Bayer </p><p>   Locust Grove, Va. </p><p></p>",
