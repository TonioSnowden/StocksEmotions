  "title": "Why I Love Golf—and What It Has Meant for My Life; Confessions of a golf fanatic after five decades of playing",
  "text": "<p>As a middle child, I had to find a way to stand out from my tennis-obsessed mother and siblings. I also needed a game I could play by myself, since my older brothers never wanted to play anything I suggested. So, just as my age odometer ticked over into double digits, I sought my own path. I took up golf.</p><p>I'm now 63 years old, and for the past five-plus decades, golf has been more than just an entertaining diversion, although it has been that, too. It is why I started dating my wife of 32 years, and where I've gone to seek refuge from the stresses of daily life. It has been a way to bond with my children and laugh with my friends. It has satisfied my craving to be challenged, and comforted me during treatments for cancer. It has been my big talk and my small talk.</p><p>No lines</p><p>Golf started for me at a nine-hole city course in a hilly Pittsburgh suburb with a couple of scrunched-up dollar bills in my pocket from my paper route that I could use to buy a Coke and a hot dog. I knew immediately that it was the game for me, in a way tennis never could be. Tennis had too many lines—too much about it was definite and repetitive. The ball goes over the net and over the net, and each time it's either in or out. Unless you get to play Centre Court at Wimbledon, one court is pretty much like another.</p><p>Not so with golf, where there are no lines. Every hole, every shot, is new, with a depth to the game that is invisible to those who don't play. If the ball is a quarter-inch back in your stance, or if your grip has moved a quarter-turn too far to the right—it can make all the difference. It's a game of constant and ever-changing challenges. I have always needed challenges, even as a kid.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you like, or dislike, about playing golf? Join the conversation below.</p><p>And you can never be perfect. One of my sons scored a 300 game in bowling. You can't get any better than that. Why, I wonder, do you even bother to keep bowling? Stephen followed up his perfect game weeks later with a 299. Was he disappointed? But with golf, even people who shoot a remarkable 59 will say it should have been a 58.</p><p>Then there are the stories. It has been said that in sports, the smaller the ball the better the stories. Golf is the perfect sport for stories. If you hit a good drive off the first tee and a good putt on the 18th green, you can head into the clubhouse and lie about everything in between.</p><p>We kidded my dad—who gave me my love of newspapers—that he had eight kids so he could tell the same story eight times. And while no golfers behind me need worry that I'm slowing down play (I've been asked by course marshals to slow down), when I play golf I feel that I have an audience for all the stories I'd like to tell.</p><p>My favorite revolves around my bride of 32 years.</p><p>I worked in Europe for The Wall Street Journal in the late '80s, and returned to Pennsylvania for a week to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. He tried to set me up with the maid of honor, but I had no interest. After all, I lived thousands of miles away.</p><p>A year later, I was back working in New York and living in New Jersey, and my friend kept nagging me about the maid of honor. I explained how difficult it would be to date someone who lived near Philadelphia when I was in Hoboken. And then he said the line that changed my life: \"She's taking golf lessons.\"</p><p>Kim and I played golf on our first date. I had to show her how to tee up the ball because to that point she had only hit off the rubber tees of a driving-range mat. Kim, who played lacrosse in high school and field hockey in college, understood how to hit a ball at her feet, but was worried about being embarrassed. Aren't we all? While waiting to tee off on a hole, I pointed out the elderly gentleman, likely a golfer for five or six decades, who jumped sideways as he swung. If golfers were embarrassed easily, I assured her, we'd have stopped long ago.</p><p>A refuge</p><p>We married and had three boys. We decided that we wanted to live someplace where we could afford a backyard with a big dog and where the boys could play. The price was that it meant we lived two hours from my work in New York.</p><p>Once again, golf was my refuge, in so many ways. For one thing, it wasn't New York City. Just like with tennis, there are too many lines in New York, with its square buildings and no horizons. Golf courses have horizons. They feed my soul.</p><p>Kim (who stopped playing 30 years ago, but plans to take it up again soon) let me play golf first thing Saturday mornings—in part to make up for my four hours of commuting each day. I would play a round of golf and then Kim and the boys would join me at the country club we belonged to. I got to unwind in the morning, and the boys learned how to behave in a restaurant. </p><p>Top from left: Tim (left) and brother Paul (right) at Cypress Point in California; a handicap card showing Tim's in single digits; the scorecard from son Brian beating Tim for the first time (in mini-golf); Tim's wife, Kim, on a putting green.

It must have been a tough year.</p><p>Our middle son, Brian, started to play golf before he could talk. Brian's first word was \"ball.\" He was obsessed (I wonder where he gets it from?), and ruined a couple of carpets growing up, thanks to hitting some 500 plastic golf balls a day. I think Brian took up golf for much the reason I did: He's a middle child and this was his chance to get away from his brothers.</p><p>It's humbling to play with him and a source of great pride. I remember the first time he broke par. I think I should get some credit for it. It was just the two of us, and on most every shot, I asked him what he was thinking, and I'd make a suggestion. I like to say that I want to take my head and put it on his body. (I also want his hole in one.)</p><p>Brian got good enough that, now in his 20s, he tried to qualify for the U.S. Amateur last year. I caddied for him. He never really had a shot at qualifying to get to the actual Amateur at Oakmont; he was in a qualifier with about 80 players for two spots on an almost 100-degree day. Brian was nervously sucking down both water and Gatorades on about every tee. Too much liquid. Nerves. The heat. He threw up on the 15th tee of the first of the two rounds. But he played all 36 holes and posted his score. I couldn't be prouder. As a father, caddying was the hardest thing I did that year.</p><p>Holes in my head</p><p>Golf has also infused my work life in surprising ways. The way I remember it is that 20 years ago, before the Journal had a real sports staff but there was a story to cover, somebody looked around and said, \"Who's the golf nut on staff?\" They found me. So I became the occasional golf writer. I've been fortunate enough to attend several U.S. Opens, Ryder Cups and the Masters. I interviewed Jack Nicklaus on the 18th green of the Oakmont U.S. Open when he chastised the USGA head honcho for its delayed ruling on a penalty, and helped to edit a book Tiger Woods wrote about this first Masters win.</p><p>In recent years, golf has offered a different kind of refuge, after I was diagnosed three times with cancer. I had to drink a lot of water every day before the radiation treatments, and for eight weeks, 15 minutes a day, I lay, all alone after the nurses left the room, under that infernal but oh-so-necessary humming machine, trying to distract myself. I played golf holes. Some days I made birdies and some days I didn't.</p><p>About halfway through the eight weeks, I promised myself a new set of golf clubs once I was done with radiation. I went to an independent shop and got custom-built clubs. I spent way more than I probably should have.</p><p>At some point—after decades of playing, after marrying a woman because she was taking golf lessons, after obsessing over holes and courses and strategies—golf became a core part of my identity. Most of my friends are golfers. I define many people by whether I've played golf with them.</p><p>It's also how I'm often introduced. \"You know Tim. He plays golf.\"</p><p>Kim and I have a friend who said she was going to stop dating men who said they played \"a little golf.\" There is no such thing as men who play a little golf.</p><p>I concede there are times when I play too much, where I feel like I'm thinking about golf more than is healthy. At times like that, I stop playing. But within a couple of days, I'm playing holes in my head, and it isn't long before I am back practicing or out on the course.</p><p>Brian remembers the time I told him years ago that if I could go to sleep and wake up the next morning a scratch golfer, I wouldn't sign up for that. It's the challenge that keeps me interested. I joke I'm going to retire from newspapering the day after we publish the \"perfect\" newspaper. I'm still here.</p><p>Golf has also helped keep me in reasonably good physical shape. I do yoga, I take the stairs, and work out just enough. When I retire, golf will ensure that I'm not sitting in my chair 8 hours a day. It's a great walk, and spoils nothing.</p><p>In the end, though, what I love about golf is just how expansive it is, and how expansive it makes me feel. Nothing is static. Golf is a full-throated, nothing-held-back drive. It's a delicate pitch over a bunker. It's the 4.25-inch cup that decides birdie, par or bogey. It is the search for the innumerable small changes that will add up to something big.</p><p>I think this is why golfers are essentially optimists. We all want to believe that the tip we picked up on the internet last night, or the change in grip that we played out in our heads this morning, or the latest $100 gadget we just got, will be the one that makes all the difference. It probably won't. But we dream.</p><p>Mr. Carroll is a Wall Street Journal senior publishing editor.
