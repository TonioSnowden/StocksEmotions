  "text": "<p>Bottle trash has become a hot commodity as companies try to make their goods and packaging more sustainable. The price of recycled polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, flake, which is usually made out of old drink containers, is up around 35% in Europe since January, according to data from Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. Higher oil and petrochemical prices pushed up the cost of virgin PET plastic, but not by as much.</p><p>Recycled PET became more expensive than virgin plastic in 2019 in Europe and the U.S., not long after big brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle began making green-packaging commitments. The premium in Europe hit a record 460 euros, the equivalent of about $460, a metric ton in late June this year, according to S&amp;P Global Platts. Prices for recycled plastic eased slightly since then -- supply increases in summer, when more bottled drinks are consumed and containers find their way into the recycling system.</p><p>The relief will be temporary. Government policies that set out minimum recycled content levels for plastic packaging are driving more companies into the market for recycled PET. In California, companies will need to use 50% recycled material in bottles by 2030. The European Union introduced deadlines covering all plastic packaging.</p><p>This will be challenging as bottle-collection rates are low -- about 27% in the U.S., based on the latest data from the National Association for PET Container Resources. To get 30% recycled content in bottles by decade's end, output of recycled PET needs to rise by an annual compound rate of 45%, ICIS calculates.</p><p>The trend points to higher plastic bills for consumer-staples companies. One of their responses will likely be trying to prevent nonfood industries from taking all old bottles. Around 70% of used bottles go to other sectors, often to make clothes, carpets or cosmetics packaging, leaving less than a third for the industry that produces them.</p><p>That looks unsustainable as the beverage industry faces tougher plastic regulations than fashion brands. The rollout of extended producer responsibility schemes for packaging -- all EU countries must have one in place by 2024 -- means companies that put plastic on the market will pay for its collection and recycling after use in many places.</p><p>Trade bodies for the soft-drink industry say this could lead to a situation where clothing companies benefit from increased investment in bottle-recycling infrastructure without any obligation to pay for it. In Europe, beverage companies are lobbying for priority access to bottle waste. If they succeed, it would be a blow for fast-fashion chains such as H&amp;M and Zara, who haven't figured out how to recycle their waste at scale. Only 14% of global polyester is made from recycled material, almost all of it spun from drinks bottles.</p><p>Any new rules would be resisted by other sectors such as carpet makers and auto companies, which rely on bottles to manufacture goods and components. The recycling industry, currently enjoying high prices after decades of poor returns, may argue that restrictions would deter investment and prove counterproductive.</p><p>Still, the more beverage companies step in to fund bottle recycling programs, the stronger their claim on the industry's increasingly valuable trash.</p>",
