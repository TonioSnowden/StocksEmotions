  "text": "<p>Profits at Lloyds Banking Group surged by more than expected in the first quarter as an improved economic outlook led it to reverse some loan-loss provisions booked at the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>Lloyds, the UK's biggest retail lender, reported a pre-tax profit of £1.9bn for the three months to March, up from less than £100m in the same period last year. The improvement was almost entirely due to the drop in bad debt provisions, with the bank reporting a net impairment credit of £323m compared with a £1.4bn charge in the first quarter of 2020.</p> <p>Revenues dropped 7 per cent year-on-year to £3.7bn, although the fall was slightly less severe than average analyst forecasts.</p> <p>Outgoing chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6140672-bc98-4c38-913c-75af869803c3\">António Horta-Osório</a>, who will step down at the end of this week to become chair of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cac83f5-9631-45ae-8080-586a6bc90d55\">Credit Suisse</a>, said the pandemic “continues to have a significant impact on people”, but said “the long-run transformation of the group has positioned the business well to address the challenges”.</p> <p>Rival lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddd53802-2352-48ec-a15d-b2fc3b9da058\">HSBC</a> made a similar move on bad debts on Tuesday. Defaults across the sector have remained lower then feared thanks to government support measures such as the furlough scheme and business rescue loan programmes.</p> <p>Jefferies analyst Joseph Dickerson said Lloyds results were “stellar on all fronts” and the 2021 guidance would result in “material” upgrades to consensus forecasts. A 13.8 per cent return on tangible equity, a measure of net profitability, was “showing what the bank is capable of generating,” he said. </p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>J Sainsbury</strong> said it expects exceptional costs associated with Covid-19 to begin falling away and remains comfortable with analysts' forecasts for this year. Underlying profit before tax for the year to March fell 39 per cent to £356m even as grocery sales rose 7.8 per cent over the year. The profit figure, which beat a £338m average of forecasts compiled by the company, includes the impact of repaying £410m of business rates relief and £485m of costs incurred in coping with the coronavirus pandemic. Exceptional charges totalling £617m took the company to a full-year statutory loss of £261m.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> said trading has remained strong since January with group sales up 12 per cent in the 25 weeks to late April. The retailer reported “very strong” online growth in all markets. Given the strong financial position, the group has reimbursed all government support for the £73m of furlough paid to UK and Ireland employees during the year, Dixons said. Full-year adjusted pre-tax profit will match expectations at £151m and medium-term guidance is unchanged, Dixons said. </p> <p><strong>Equiniti</strong>, the services provider for listed companies, said the private equity group Siris Capital has raised its takeover proposal by 10p a share to 170p. Equiniti said that following talks with advisers it would be minded to recommend a firm offer from Siris and would allow access to relevant due diligence information.</p> <p><strong>WPP</strong> reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67fd6d9f-780f-4438-9559-a7d970440cc7\">strong start to the year</a>, saying all its business segments and most major markets had returned to like-for-like growth. First-quarter revenue was up 1.8 per cent with $1.3bn of new business won, the advertising agency said. It left 2021 targets unchanged. </p> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Persimmon</strong> said in a trading update that current forward sales are 23 per cent ahead of last year and 11 per cent ahead of the same point in 2019, with build rates continuing at pre-Covid levels. “Demand for newly built homes remains healthy and the group's sales rates are encouraging,” it said.</p> <p><strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong> reported gross profit of £1.5bn in the first quarter, down 0.5 per cent year on year. At constant currencies the company's data and analytics division increased revenue by 4.7 per cent as fixed income and derivatives demand offset a decline for the equities and foreign exchange niches. Revenue was up 6.4 per cent at the capital markets division. The exchange scheduled an investor event for July to “give deeper insight” into its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57b1b431-f897-47f8-a4c8-f4efdebefcfe\">business transformation</a>.</p> <p>Disinfectant maker <strong>Reckitt</strong> posted 4.1 per cent like-for-like revenue growth for the first quarter, driven by continued double-digit growth from its hygiene products division. Lower demand for cold and flu relief products held back sales at its health division while the nutrition segment suffered from US stockpiling in previous periods along with “difficult market conditions” in Greater China, particularly Hong Kong. Its 2021 guidance was unchanged.</p> <p><strong>CRH</strong>, the aggregates maker, said 2021 had started positively with first quarter like-for-like sales up 3 per cent, as a “particularly strong performance” for building products was partly offset by disruption from bad weather in North America and Europe. Underlying demand remained good and pricing continued to improve across key markets, CRH said in a trading update. </p> <p><strong>Stagecoach</strong> founders Brian Souter, a non-executive director at the bus group, and his sister Ann Gloag sold nearly 11.6m&#xa0;shares overnight, equivalent to a 2.1 per cent stake. The sale reduced their holding in the company to 25 per cent. Stagecoach said that for financial planning purposes the founding family has a ten-year plan to reduce their shareholdings to approximately 5 per cent. </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> has named as new non-executive directors Dominique Reiniche, the former chief executive of Coca-Cola Europe, and Cafe Rouge founder Karen Jones.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Listings on stock markets around the world are running at a record pace, with both deal numbers and values at their highest levels for the start of any year&#xa0;in at least two decades. The deluge of <strong>initial public offerings, </strong>helped by the flotations of a spree of shell companies, has lifted proceeds to a record-setting $230bn this year, well above the previous peak of $80bn set in 2000, according <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/857c1286-d35e-404a-ae7c-8d04b7508810\">to data from Dealogic</a> that cover the last 26 years. </p> <p>Google's parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c686458c-e544-4c50-990d-954b91d955ed\">record results on Tuesday</a> as the pandemic kept people at home, watching YouTube videos and clicking on web advertisements served up by the company. It also announced a $50bn share buyback programme, helping send its shares up 4.5 per cent in after-hours trading.&#xa0;A growing dependence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/322f116d-8280-4a95-8392-6f59179d9d91\">on cloud computing services</a> pushed <strong>Microsoft's</strong> earnings up 19 per cent. Today is the turn of <strong>Apple</strong>, which is expected to post <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c771d98e-75fa-48e5-8477-f466e72d6e27\">stellar second-quarter results</a>.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> told all of its US bankers on Tuesday that they should start to make arrangements to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd2a0a9-19b5-4904-b624-d7bf613b2ef8\">back in the office</a> on a rotational basis by early July. The bank's senior leadership team, including chief executive Jamie Dimon, sent a memo to all staff telling them to prepare for the return, making JPMorgan the first major Wall Street firm to outline a detailed schedule for workers to go back to the office.</p> <p><strong>Santander</strong> is overhauling the management of two of its most important European businesses, including starting the search for a chief executive in the UK, as it looks to boost profitability after reporting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e8f05a1-e37c-4f1f-b1da-dcc13e566a98\">its strongest quarterly earnings</a> in more than a decade. A boom in bond trading, strong results in asset management and a clean exit from its exposure to family office Archegos Capital helped <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> record <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa760b98-6514-425d-a208-b397a348b30c\">its highest quarterly profit</a> since 2014.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Warriors for social justice or profiteering ambulance chasers?
