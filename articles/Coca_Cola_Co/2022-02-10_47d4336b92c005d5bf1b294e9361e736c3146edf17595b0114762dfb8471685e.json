The year-over-year rate of U.S. inflation climbed again in January to 7.5% and stayed at a 40-year high, suggesting upward pressure on consumer prices is unlikely to relent in the near future. On a monthly basis, the consumer-price index rose 0.6% in January. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.4% gain.</p><p>Inflation “was piping hot and now there are greater chances for the Fed to adopt more aggressive policy. In fact, our base case scenario is that by July we may see a full percentage point increase in the interest rate,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note.</p><p>“There's still one CPI and PCE (personal consumer expenditures) report each on the docket before the next [Fed policy] meeting” in March, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.</p><p>“All else equal, more fuel to the inflation fire should harden the Fed's resolve to begin raising interest rates at its next meeting in March and introduce quantitative tightening in the months thereafter,” he said, adding that chances of a half-point hike should be viewed as a possibility, though a quarter-point move remains the base case.</p><p>And:High inflation has jacked up the cost of food, gas, cars and rent – and there's little relief in sight</p><p>Treasury yields jumped, with the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y briefly topping the 2% threshold for the first time since 2019. The rate remained just shy of 2% at 1.992% in recent action, according to FactSet.</p><p>The higher-than-expected inflation number is seen maintaining pressure on interest-rate sensitive technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite suffered its biggest percentage drop in almost two years last month, as well as its worst January in over a decade due to worries over inflation and tighter Federal Reserve monetary policy.</p><p>In other data, jobless claims fell 16,000 in latest week to 223,000.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Disney shares DIS climbed after the entertainment giant reported record revenue and a profit of more than $1 billion as it added streaming subscribers than expected over the holidays, theme-park profit surged.</p><p>Shares of Coca-Cola Co.KO were up 1.6% after the beverage giant delivered results that topped expectations and saw sales rise.</p><p>Twitter Inc.TWTR shares rose 1% after results largely met expectations and the social media company announced a new $4 billion buyback program.</p><p>Twillio Inc.TWLO shares edged down 0.2% after the cloud communication software group posted a strong outlook and earnings and sales that shot past Wall Street estimates.</p><p>Uber Technologies Inc.
