  "text": "<p>   The students chose Woolworth's because they found its policies particularly galling. \"They tell you to come in: 'Yes, buy the toothpaste; yes, come in and buy the notebook paper . . . No, we don't separate your money in this cash register,'\" recalled Franklin McCain, one of the four. \"The whole system, of course, was unjust, but that just seemed like insult added to injury.\" A whites-only lunch counter violated the promise of modern shopping. </p><p>   The Greensboro sit-in lasted almost six months, drawing hundreds of participants and counterprotesters and spreading to other downtown stores. Finally in July the store gave in, officially desegregating its lunch counter. Student-led sit-ins swept the South, usually with results that included an end to other anti-Black policies. </p><p>   \"Segregated eateries were emblematic of the profound contradictions of American consumer culture: although situated in the 'democratic space' of the department store, they were Jim Crow spaces that reinforced white supremacy and black inferiority,\" writes Ms. Parker. \"Indeed, such lunch counters may well have become targets for civil-rights protests because they rendered America's racial contradictions so visible in everyday life.\" </p><p>   For shoppers in the 19th and 20th century, equality accompanied mass production, mass distribution and mass marketing -- the same standardized goods for everyone. As Andy Warhol put it, \"You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.\" </p><p>   Today Coke has fragmented into multiple versions, and restaurant fountains offer customers the chance to mix custom concoctions. To the uniformity of mass consumption, today's shopping adds a respect for individual differences -- a new kind of equality and freedom. Consumer choices embody political convictions, religious values and cultural affiliations. What Americans believe and what they are likely to buy are increasingly aligned, and we've only begun to wrestle with what this shift means for how we conceive of equality and freedom. \"The endless hunt for the unattainable\" isn't merely a quest for customer satisfaction but for the realization of social ideals. The quest doesn't end at the sales counter, but it often begins there. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Postrel is a visiting fellow at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy at Chapman University and the author most recently of \"The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World.\" She writes a newsletter on Substack. </p><p></p>",
