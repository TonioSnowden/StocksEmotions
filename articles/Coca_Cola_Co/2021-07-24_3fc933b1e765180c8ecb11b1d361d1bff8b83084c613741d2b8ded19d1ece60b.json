Otteson </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Power of Creative Destruction </p><p>\n  Philippe Aghion, Celine Antonin and Simon Bunel </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  James R. Otteson's \"Seven Deadly Economic Sins\" (Cambridge, 305 pages, $27.95) is a fine effort to introduce readers to the basic principles of market economics. The hamartiological framing -- the \"sins\" are bad assumptions about how markets work -- is part of the author's effort to make the subject more engaging than a typical treatise on economics. It works. Mr. Otteson, a professor of business ethics at Notre Dame, writes with an apt combination of casual wit and rigorous logic. </p><p>\n  I only regret that the book had to be written at all. There was a time in this country's history -- if the reader will allow a bit of declinist gloom -- when America's political class understood by instinct that wealth in a market economy comes about by voluntary exchanges in which all parties benefit. We do not live in such a time. About half of this country's high-level elected officials appear to believe that some Americans have money because they took it from other Americans (the rich got rich \"on the backs of workers\" is a common trope). And so it is left to scholars such as Mr. Otteson to spell out the difference between zero-sum and positive-sum economic relationships. </p><p>\n  A transaction based on extraction or theft is zero-sum (1 --1 = 0). A transaction based on a mutual exchange is positive-sum (1+1 = 2). Wealth in most societies before about 1800, he reminds us, was based on the former model; wealth in market economies is based on the latter. What we need is someone able to explain to our well-intentioned politicos that the wealth they want to reallocate came about from mutually beneficial positive-sum transactions and not from zero-sum extraction. The way to diminish poverty  and aid the disadvantaged is therefore not to punish positive-sum exchanges by taxation, but to allow more of them. </p><p>\n  Other chapters in the book treat the \"Good Is Good Enough Fallacy,\" or the idea that every beneficial end is worth pursuing by all available means; the \"Progress Is Inevitable Fallacy,\" or the idea that a certain level of prosperity is guaranteed no matter what we do; and the \"Great Mind Fallacy,\" or the idea \"that there is some person or group that possesses the relevant knowledge to know how others should allocate their scarce time or treasure.\" </p><p>\n  This latter point isn't new -- you can read the gist of it in Friedrich Hayek's essay \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) or Thomas Sowell's book  \"Knowledge and Decisions\" (1980) -- but Mr. Otteson helpfully elucidates it in terms of individual experience. The experts may know that high-sugar carbonated drinks are on balance bad for your health, but they cannot know if you, in your circumstances, should or shouldn't have a Coke. Most people would agree with that observation, but it is remarkable how many government policies are premised on its antithesis. City bans on unhealthy habits, state subsidies for favored industries, tax breaks meant to encourage virtuous behavior -- these and a thousand other  state-backed strategems assume the authorities and their experts understand immeasurably complex circumstances that they can't possibly understand. But the alternative -- allowing the people who do understand them to make their own decisions, even if they're wrong -- isn't so satisfying to our governmental minders. </p><p>\n   \"The Power of Creative Destruction\" (Belknap/Harvard, 389 pages, $35), translated by Jodie Cohen-Tanugi, is a full expression of the Great Mind outlook. Not that the authors -- Philippe Aghion, Celine Antonin and Simon Bunel, all associated with the College de France -- are socialists or militant redistributionists. They are mandarins. They recognize that you can't pay for the modern welfare state or enjoy high levels of prosperity without robust economic growth. But capitalism, in their view, is constantly menacing itself and requires the aid of sage policy makers to prevent its collapse. </p><p>\n  The authors are heavily influenced by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. In \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\" (1942), Schumpeter contended that capitalism was doomed by its own logic. The capitalist system depends on a constant succession of entrepreneurs dislodging established firms -- a process he called \"creative destruction.\" But eventually, he saw, yesterday's innovators become today's monopolists and learn to use the levers of power to prevent further innovation. Growth diminishes; a dissatisfied public demands welfare-state protections and restrictions on entrepreneurial activity; and capitalism, deprived of growth, slowly transmutes into socialism. </p><p>\n  Clearly some parts of that analysis are valid, although Schumpeter was mistaken, in my view, to think of capitalism as a \"structure\" that can't adapt to the demands placed on it by an intermittently irrational public. Mr. Aghion, Ms. Antonin and   Mr. Bunel share Schumpeter's overdefined understanding of capitalism. \"Capitalism must reward innovation,\" they write, \"but it must be regulated to prevent innovation rents\" -- rents meaning profits accruing  to incumbent firms -- \"from stifling competition and thus jeopardizing future innovation.\" </p><p>\n  And what sort of regulations do they think will encourage innovation, foster competition and save capitalism from itself? You may have guessed already. Industrial policy: tariffs and  other protections, subsidies to viable industries and firms, \"investments\" in R&amp;D and  higher education, and so on. What capitalism needs, if I may put their argument in my own words, is more public officials ready to heed the advice of centrist academic economists. </p><p>\n  The book is rife with charts and graphs, and the authors cite a bewildering array of highly specialized studies. Much of this technical argumentation strikes me as overdone. I appreciate, for instance, the conclusion that lobbying and barriers to entry are likelier than innovation and competition to aggravate inequality. But people who think markets worsen inequality are committed to an unfalsifiable ideology and won't be moved by any combination of graph-packed quantitative studies. </p><p>\n  \"The Power of Creative Destruction\" is an impressive book in its way, but the authors don't acknowledge the -- to me -- obvious objection. Once you afford governmental bodies the power to manage the economy, you also give established firms the tools with which to insulate themselves from competition. Wouldn't it be easier and more effective to deprive incumbent firms of any special privileges and let them figure out how to survive? Then again, if we did that, we wouldn't need so many mandarins. </p><p></p>",
