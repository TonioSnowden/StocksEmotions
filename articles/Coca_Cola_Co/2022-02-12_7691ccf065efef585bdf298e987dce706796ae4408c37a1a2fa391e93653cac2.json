  "text": "<p>Higher price tags aren't cutting into shoppers' appetite for meat. Tyson said Monday consumer demand for its beef, chicken and pork products remained strong despite escalating prices, helping the company more than double its quarterly profit. The company said costs related to labor shortages, supply-chain issues and inflation are driving prices higher. The White House in January responded to the meat industry's rising profit with an outline of tighter regulations for U.S. meatpackers, saying the industry used its scale to inflate Americans' food bills. Tyson shares climbed 12% Monday.</p><p>SPIRIT AIRLINES INC.</p><p>SAVE +17%</p><p>A new airline partnership took off Monday. Frontier Group Holdings Inc. agreed to buy Spirit for $2.9 billion in cash and stock in a deal that would create a discount-airline juggernaut. The consolidation comes as the travel industry claws its way back toward pre-pandemic levels despite higher costs, labor shortages and Covid-related disruptions. Airlines such as Spirit and Frontier that focus on cheap fares to leisure travelers added back capacity more quickly. Spirit and Frontier said the new deal allows them to compete more aggressively against competitors. Spirit shares jumped 17% Monday.</p><p>PEPSICO INC.</p><p>PEP -2.1%</p><p>Price increases brought some fizz back to PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co. The soda giants reported higher sales in the recent quarter as they charged more for their products, which for PepsiCo includes Lay's potato chips and other packaged foods. But inflationary pressures weighed on profits as costs rose for trucking, agricultural commodities and packaging. Pepsico shares fell 2.1% Thursday, while Coke shares ended 3.7% lower.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON +25%</p><p>A new leader is pedaling uphill at Peloton. The stationary-bike maker named former Spotify exec Barry McCarthy to succeed Chief Executive John Foley, who will become executive chairman. The New York company on Tuesday also lowered its revenue forecasts and said it would cut roughly 20% of its corporate positions to help cope with widening losses. Once a pandemic darling, Peloton sagged as lockdowns eased and gyms filled up again. In January, activist investor Blackwells Capital LLC called for the company to fire Mr. Foley and explore a sale. Peloton shares soared 25% Tuesday.</p><p>NVIDIA CORP.</p><p>NVDA +1.7%</p><p>Nvidia was willing to lose an Arm. The semiconductor giant on Tuesday called off its blockbuster deal to buy a chip-design specialist called Arm, which is owned by SoftBank Group Corp. The companies said they agreed not to move forward due to significant regulatory challenges. Nvidia in 2020 agreed to buy Arm for $40 billion, but the Federal Trade Commission in 2021 sued to block the transaction. The regulator alleged it would give Nvidia unlawful control over computing technology and designs that rivals need to develop their own competing chips. Nvidia shares added 1.7% Tuesday.</p><p>WALT DISNEY CO.</p><p>DIS +3.4%</p><p>\"Encanto\" helped bring some magic back to Disney. The entertainment giant beat expectations by adding 11.8 million new Disney+ subscribers in the recent holiday quarter. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said that the turnaround in subscription growth can be attributed to several films and shows -- including the Oscar-nominated animated films \"Encanto\" and \"Luca\" -- as well as a focus on new content for Star Wars and Marvel. He also cited a decision to bundle Disney+ subscriptions with Disney's Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services. Disney shares rose 3.4% Thursday.</p><p>UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>UBER -6.1%</p><p>Uber's customers keep ordering in even as they go out. The ride-hailing company on Wednesday said revenue climbed 83% in the last quarter of 2021, aided by a recovery in its rides business and demand for food delivery from its Uber Eats division. Uber said estimated wait times for riders had returned to pre-pandemic levels across the U.S. However, Uber on Thursday spooked investors with a midterm earnings forecast that fell short of expectations, even as it predicted to be cash-flow positive by the end of 2022. Uber shares lost 6.1% Thursday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
