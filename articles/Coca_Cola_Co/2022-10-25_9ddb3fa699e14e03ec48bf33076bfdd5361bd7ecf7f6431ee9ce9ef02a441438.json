  "text": "<p>Our call of the day from Jeffrey Kolitch, the portfolio manager of the Baron Real Estate Fund BREFX, who sees rare bargains among \"best in class\" related companies thanks to a big pullback for those stocks this year.</p><p>So much so, that if the current downturn leads to a recession, real-estate companies will be at a good starting point, Kolitch said in his recent third-quarter shareholder letter. And while he's wary about the near term, thanks to central-bank hikes and political risks, he's more optimistic about the two-to-three view.</p><p>Over the first nine months of 2022, many real-estate companies have seen 30% to 60% corrections that have factored in low valuation multiples and expectations for slower growth, said Kolitch, adding that their fund is now \"chock-full of real-estate stocks that are unsustainably cheap.\"</p><p>Kolitch is optimistic due to strong business fundamentals and healthy balance sheets he sees for many companies, along with signs of hope for the overall economy â€” moderating inflation, plentiful jobs, central bank hiking that's likely mostly done and a China rebound that's just getting started.</p><p>He also notes that they've seen no signs of excessive use of leverage and overbuilding that marked the housing bust of 2008. \"We always have our attenae up for warning signs in the real-estate sector,\" he said.</p><p>Onto his \"best-in-class\" picks, which must meet criteria that includes: ownership of unique and well-located assets in markets with high barriers to entry, strong long-term growth prospects, sector leaders, conservative and liquid balance sheet and solid management.</p><p>Looking at real-estate investment trusts (REITs), Kolitch highlights Invitation Homes INVH, the biggest institutional owner of single-family rental homes, focused in neighborhoods with decent schools and employment opportunities. Equity Residential EQR is another, the biggest U.S. apartment REIT with high-quality units in choice coastal markets.</p><p>Global carrier and cloud-neutral data center operator Equinix EQIX and industrial REIT giant Prologis PLD also get mentions.</p><p>Among residential-related picks are some familiar names, including home builders Lennar LEN and Toll Brothers TOL and home-improvement retailer Lowe's Companies LOW, who each get the nod for cheap valuations, along with hard-surface flooring specialist Floor &amp; Decor FND.</p><p>Among alternative asset managers, Kolitch notes Brookfield Asset Management CA:BAM.A is valued at a more than 50% discount to management's own assessment, while biggie Blackstone BX is valued at a \"modest premium\" to the S&amp;P 500 index despite \"far superior long-term growth prospects.\"</p><p>Under the travel-related real estate umbrella, the manager likes casino group MGM Resorts International's MGM \"compelling\" value, along with mountain resorts giant Vail Resorts MTN.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stock futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 are lower after the S&amp;P 500 saw its best close in a month, with bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y edging lower, the dollar DXY up slightly and oil prices CL.1 BRN00 tilting south. Bitcoin BTCUSD is trading around $19,356.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Ahead of the market open, earnings from GE GE, Coca-Cola KO, GM GM, UPS UPS, Biogen BIIB, Lockheed Martin LMT, Xerox XRX and 3M MMM are all on tap.</p><p>After the bell, we'll get Microsoft MSFT (preview), Alphabet GOOGL (preview), Twitter TWTR and Texas Instruments TXN on the tech front. Visa V, Chipotle CMG, Spotify SPOT and Mattel MAT are among those in the late lineup.</p><p>Shares of Weber WEBR are up 24% in premarket, matching the premium offered byits biggest shareholder to buy the grill maker's remaining stock for $6.25 each.</p><p>The S&amp;P Case-Shiller and Federal Housing Finance Agency will release August home-price indexes at 9 a.m. Eastern, followed by a consumer confidence index.</p><p>Adidas XE:ADS has ended its partnership with rapper Kanye West over his recent slew of antisemitic remarks that also have led to his talent agency dropping him and bans by Twitter TWTR and Instagram.</p><p>Best of the web</p><p>TikTok plans to use your data to fuel its multibillion-dollar shopping mall</p><p>Mud, the environmentally friendly beauty all-star that may save us all. (subscription required)</p><p>Doctor who survived Ebola, says we have a few months to get ready for the next pandemic</p><p>The chart</p><p>How sticky is high inflation? A team of strategists at Deutsche Bank, led by Jim Reid, have taken a look at consumer price inflation from 1920 (where available) onward for 50 developed and emerging market countries, when inflation reaches 8%.</p><p>\"Looking at this full history, the evidence shows that once inflation spikes above 8%, median inflation takes around 2 years to even fall beneath 6%, before settling around that level out to 5 years after the initial 8% shock. This is around 2pp above the pre-shock median of c. 4%,\" said the strategists. U.S. CPI hit 8.5% in March.</p><p>As they point out, current consensus expects inflation to be back or even below 3% just two years after that first breach of 8%. While \"history never repeats exactly,\" when inflation normally breaches these thresholds, history shows it's fairly sticky, especially in post-1970 periods,\" said Reid and the team.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>These were the top-searched tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern: </p><p> Ticker  Security name  TSLA    Tesla  MULN    Mullen Automotive  GME     GameStop  NIO     NIO  AMC     AMC Entertainment  APE     AMC Entertainment preferred shares  BABA    Alibaba  AAPL    Apple  BBBY    Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  TWTR    Twitter</p><p>Random reads</p><p>New Zealand is struggling to fill this \"dream job\" on a UNESCO heritage site</p><p>Swedish archaeologists unearth a long-lost 17th-century warship</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but  sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
