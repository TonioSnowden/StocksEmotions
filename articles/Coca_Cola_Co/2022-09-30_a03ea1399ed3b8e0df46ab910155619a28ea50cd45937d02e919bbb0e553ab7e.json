  "text": "<p>I see from Day in the Markets, David Beckham backs Guild Esports (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a312f45-5ed2-4e17-86d2-e6404f81fec1\">September 27</a>). In July, Guild Esports signed a global sponsorship deal with The Coca-Cola Company which is now Guild's official “soft drinks and hydration partner”. Guild's share price rose 40 per cent on the news.</p> <p>Other stars in the football world have taken a different stance with regard to Coca-Cola. Kylian Mbappé and Cristiano Ronaldo have both distanced themselves from their teams' publicity deals with what they regard as unhealthy foods and beverages. Mbappé's opposition extends to online betting groups with his recent boycott of a publicity photo shoot with France's national team.</p> <p>As the old football guard plugs away, using its cash pile to make more cash, some of the upcoming stars are taking a different tack. Here's hoping that Mbappe's campaign will see an end to the obscene amount of sports betting ads on French television.</p> <p><strong>Neil McNaughton</strong><br><em>Sèvres, France</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Here's an issue on which Beckham is the ‘old guard'' FT.com 30 September.
