  "text": "<p>Since then, health officials have been evacuating patients and placing them in other nursing homes. The residents had arrived Friday as evacuees from seven other facilities in southeastern Louisiana that were more squarely in the storm's path, according to the department. As of Thursday, 12 patients required hospitalization and roughly 120 still needed to be evacuated.</p><p>\"This is a serious and active investigation,\" the department said. \"We will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement.\"</p><p>The situation brings Hurricane Ida's death toll in Louisiana to five. In Mississippi, two people died earlier this week after driving into a sinkhole where a highway collapsed.</p><p>Recovery efforts have been plodding and plagued by intense heat. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Thursday, with a possible heat index of 107 degrees, reflecting what the temperature feels like when factoring in humidity.</p><p>Services in New Orleans were trickling in and some lights flickering on Thursday. About 915,000 people remained without power in the state, down from more than a million immediately after the storm, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utilities' outage reports. Gov. John Bel Edwards has said it could take weeks to restore power throughout the state, particularly the hard-hit, sparsely populated parishes south of New Orleans.</p><p>For the most part, people have kept the peace, helped one another out and obeyed a mandatory 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. \"Thank you so much for continuing to hold the line, demonstrating real patience,\" she told residents in a recent video.</p><p>The mayor said that ice, water and food distribution would continue to accelerate as more supplies and reinforcements arrive. Garbage collection resumed Thursday, but the city said it would be limited by the lack of available workers.</p><p>At sites dotted around New Orleans Thursday, residents flocked to cooling stations at community centers and on city buses to escape the heat.</p><p>The city opened a first-aid center on Thursday, with an oxygen tank exchange, basic medical assessments and some ability to prescribe medicine. At the site Thursday morning, babies cried while dozens of people charged their electronics at folding tables.</p><p>Jerry Ricks, 60 years old, was there to pick up heart medication. \"I was really worried about getting it because my clinic delivered my medicine, but they're not doing deliveries now,\" he said. Since Ida, he has been anxious about his medication and by the unrelenting heat. He added, \"I woke up a couple of times and my arm was still fanning.\"</p><p>Rickie Williams, 66, biked over from his house around the block to charge his phone. He said he has been riding his Schwinn all over in search of food and water. \"It feels like you're out scavenging. You have food here and there, but you've got to go different places to get it,\" he said. \"People are very frustrated. I'm only sleeping two or three hours a night because of the heat.\"</p><p>Some parts of the French Quarter and the center city had their power restored overnight, drawing weary residents to restaurants and bars for cold drinks and cool air.</p><p>Richard Bullock, a 55-year-old attorney, said he was ecstatic when the power came on at the historic Bourbon Street servants' quarters house he shares with his husband. \"We started dancing and singing, 'I've got the power!' \" he said.</p><p>Mr. Bullock said he went to the Crossing, a local bar, \"to support them and have a bourbon and diet Coke.\"</p><p>Bartender Trevor Cook, a 43-year-old who lives in nearby Treme, said he was happy to show up to work at 6 a.m. because his house was \"a sweat box.\" There were more than 50 people at the bar before noon, many of them tourists whose flights had been canceled, he said.</p><p>Entergy Corp., the region's dominant energy provider, said it is repairing transmission lines and infrastructure with the help of 20,000 workers from 38 states. The company said it has restored power to 167,000 customers in the region and to several hospitals, including Ochsner Medical Center's main campus in New Orleans, among the largest in the state.</p><p>The highways were mostly clear of debris but gas was scarce, with 65% of stations in the city and those an hour away in Baton Rouge out of fuel on Thursday, according to the fuel-and-price tracker GasBuddy. The line at the local Costco gas station was 2 miles long.</p><p>President Biden said he would travel Friday to New Orleans to inspect hurricane damage. \"My message to everyone affected is we're all in this together. The nation is here to help,\" Mr. Biden said at the White House Thursday.</p><p>He said that he had directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to use all tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \"to keep gas flowing to the pumps.\"</p><p>Ken Thomas contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rachel Wolfe at rachel.wolfe@wsj.com and Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com</p><p>After Ida, Power and Services Slowly Return to Louisiana</p>",
