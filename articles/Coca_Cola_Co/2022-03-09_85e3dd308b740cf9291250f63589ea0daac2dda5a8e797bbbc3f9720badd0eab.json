  "title": "Marguerite Steed Hoffman: ‘You can't make a great museum by acquiring works one by one'",
  "text": "<p>Marguerite Steed Hoffman — collector, philanthropist, businesswoman, biotech and theatre investor, museum leader and community activist — describes herself as a “hedonistic do-gooder”.</p> <p>It's a modest appellation for someone who, with her late husband Robert Hoffman, was the driving force behind a transformative gift of art to the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) in Texas. In 2005, the Hoffmans and local collectors and philanthropists Howard and Cindy Rachofsky and Deedie Rose together promised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a6bd848-afe2-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0\">more than 800&#xa0;artworks</a> to the institution, ranging from postwar Japanese artists to American contemporary sculpture. Since then, the contribution has expanded, numbering 950 works, and is probably worth four times what it was at the time of the gift. Separately, she has gifted works by&#xa0;Mark Bradford, Peter Doig and Christopher Wool.</p> <p>We meet on a chilly afternoon in London while Hoffman is on a short visit, ahead of the UK publication of a two-volume, 980-page book featuring 400 works in her collection. Small, softly spoken, warm and funny, she is unostentatiously dressed in a dark jacket and trousers, with no make-up or jewellery.</p> <p>“I think public service is in the DNA of my family,” she says, explaining the huge influence that her grandfather, Tom Steed, had on her. “He came from a family of cotton-pickers and was one of 11 children, each named after public figures — his full name was Thomas Jefferson.” He became a Democratic congressman for Oklahoma for 32 years, and as an adolescent she spent time with his family in Washington, DC.</p> <p>Her family were certainly not art collectors. “They had terrible art!” she says, laughing. “Terrible! They didn't have bad taste in art, they had&#xa0;<em>no</em>&#xa0;taste.” However, her grandmother picked up on her interest in the subject. So, during vacations with her grandparents, she was often deposited, with a packed lunch, at the National Gallery of Art and left to explore its wonders on her own. “I am sure [the museum staff] thought I was some kind of orphan.”</p> <p>This was to be the beginning of a life-long engagement with art — she studied classics, then took her MA in art history. “I was the first woman to go to college in my family, on either side,” she says.</p> <p>Her first purchase came in the 1990s, before she married Robert, when she was working for the Gerald Peters Gallery in Dallas. She saw a painting by a California-born artist, Richard Shaffer: “Very atmospheric, in blues and greys,” she says, “and embedded in it were words, and I am always a sucker for stuff with language. I drove after work to the gallery where it was on display, and sat outside looking at it, in the window, with my car's headlights on — so long that a passing police patrol stopped to investigate.”</p> <p>The next day she called the dealer: “I don't have any money, but I&#xa0;<em>need</em>&#xa0;that picture.” She made a deal and bought it, paying it off “for years”. “It still means a lot to me.”</p> <p>It was after her 1990s marriage to Robert — a businessman, philanthropist and co-founder of the groundbreaking humour magazine&#xa0;National Lampoon — that their collecting really kicked into gear. One of his early purchases had been a Richard Diebenkorn painting; he was already “well formed” as an art lover when they met, she says. “He wanted to collect artists ‘of our time' but not emerging artists,” and carried a list of targets by Cy Twombly, Jasper Johns, Philip Guston and Frank Stella. He and his father had a large&#xa0;Coca-Cola bottling company, which they sold for $1.1bn in 1998. “We quickly spent a lot of that money, mainly on art,” says Hoffman.</p> <p>Robert, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/obituaries/22hoffman.html\">who died from leukaemia in 2006</a>, aged 59, had been a trustee of the DMA. “Early on,” says Hoffman, “I realised you can't make a great museum by acquiring works one by one. You need gifts of whole collections — they form the nucleus. If you don't have that bedrock, it's really hard to tell the stories you want [to tell].” So the last big decision she made with Robert was their bequest, while they were co-chairs of a campaign to raise $150mn for the institution's 100th&#xa0;anniversary. “Deedie Rose and the Rachofskys came in with us,” Hoffman says. They raised even more than&#xa0;that sum&#xa0;and all pledged to bequeath their collections to the museum.</p> <p>Hoffman's holdings of contemporary art have astonishing depth and breadth, covering painting, sculpture, photography, new media and installations and photography. They brim with pretty well all the super-established names — Agnes Martin, Robert Rauschenberg, Louise Bourgeois, Willem de Kooning, Ellsworth Kelly — as well as lesser-known ones such as Vincent Fecteau, Aleana Egan and Shelagh Wakely. Everything in this part of her collection will go to the DMA at the time of her death.</p> <p>The book on her collection, <em>Amor Mundi: The Collection of Marguerite Steed Hoffman</em>, is now published by&#xa0;Ridinghouse. “This is a love project,” she says. “I wanted to make sure that the ideas and experiences that went into acquiring these works of art were recorded.” And she stresses that philanthropy and collecting are still thrilling for her, even as she has become a successful investor, notably in biotech, with a focus on leukaemia, and in theatre companies.</p> <p>I ask her if she ever thought of establishing a private museum, so much the fashion these days. “I can't think of a worse nightmare!” she exclaims. “It's a big responsibility, it's expensive and funds that could go to acquiring art would go on running it. I care about access for all — for example, access for the little girl from Oklahoma who grew up with bad prints on the walls in her home but spent days in the Washington National Gallery of Art. In this way, perhaps I can make the world a better place.”</p> <p><em>‘Amor Mundi: The Collection of Marguerite Steed Hoffman' is published by Ridinghouse, </em><a href=\"https://www.karstenschubert.com/publications/193-amor-mundi-the-collection-of-marguerite-steed-hoffman/\"><em>karstenschubert.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Georgina Adam 2022 'Marguerite Steed Hoffman: ‘You can't make a great museum by acquiring works one by one'' FT.com 9 March.
