  "text": "<p>Coca-Cola's sales rebounded in the first three months of the year as accelerating Covid-19 vaccinations and a rollback in restrictions on restaurants and bars renewed demand for its fizzy drinks.</p> <p>Results released on Monday showed volume trends steadily improved each month of the first quarter. By March, unit case volume had returned to levels last seen in 2019.</p> <p>James Quincey, chief executive, said he was particularly encouraged by the company's performance in markets where vaccine availability was increasing and economies were reopening. </p> <p>Coca-Cola produced $9bn in net revenues during the period, a 5 per cent increase year on year and better than analysts' average estimate of about $8.6bn. Sales rose 6 per cent on an organic basis.</p> <p>Net sales had fallen 11 per cent in 2020, weighed down by the closure of restaurants, bars, cinemas and other venues that normally account for about half of Coca-Cola's annual revenues.</p> <p>While beverages consumed at home continued to underpin its first-quarter results, Coca-Cola said it expected hospitality sector reopenings to fuel a recovery this year.</p> <p>The company on Monday reaffirmed its forecast that organic sales would rise by a high single-digit percentage in 2021.</p> <p>Rival PepsiCo, the company behind brands such as 7Up and Doritos, said last week it expected sales growth to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fa43ff2-e2eb-4e6f-8356-f1c05e14551d\">accelerate</a> in the second quarter, anticipating that rising vaccination numbers would encourage more consumers to return to restaurants and bars.</p> <p>John Murphy, Coca-Cola's chief financial officer, said away-from-home sales should continue to recover into the second half of the year. Some markets are ahead of the curve, while sales in other parts of the world were expected to follow suit “when some degree of normality returns on the mobility front”.</p> <p>“I think the word of the year is asynchronous,” Murphy said in an interview.</p> <p>The hospitality sector remained under pressure in the first quarter. Coca-Cola, whose portfolio includes Sprite, Fanta and SmartWater, registered a 4 per cent rise in case volume in sparkling soft drinks, despite weakness in the North American fountain business and away-from-home channels in Europe.</p> <p>Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages were up 3 per cent. Minute Maid and Simply juices were strong sellers in the US, Murphy said, driven by the number of consumers eating breakfast at home during the pandemic.</p> <p>Net revenues advanced 3 per cent in North America but declined in Latin America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Robust growth in China pushed the Asia-Pacific region to a 24 per cent increase in sales.</p> <p>Overall, first-quarter net income fell 19 per cent year on year to $2.25bn, or 52 cents a share. Coca-Cola earned 55 cents a share on an adjusted basis, beating a consensus forecast of 50 cents.</p> <p>The company also announced plans for Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to be listed as a publicly traded company. Coca-Cola intends to sell a portion of its shares in CCBA through an initial public offering.</p><p>Source: Matthew Rocco in New York 2021 'Coca-Cola sales rise as Covid vaccinations bolster recovery' FT.com 19 April.
