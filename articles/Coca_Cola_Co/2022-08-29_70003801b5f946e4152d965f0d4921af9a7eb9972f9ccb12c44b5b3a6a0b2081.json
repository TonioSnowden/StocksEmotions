  "title": "This 67-Year-Old Artist Made the Most Iconic Jackets of the '90s. Now He's Back. Jeff Hamilton, the leather auteur who popularized the logo jackets worn by Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Jeff Gordon, is back from retirement—with a brand that's hotter than ever",
  "text": "<p>If his name isn't familiar, you've certainly seen Mr. Hamilton's work. In the '90s, it seemed that nearly every pop culture figure worth their MTV News segment wore one of his jackets: Madonna, Vanilla Ice, LL Cool J, even Nelson Mandela. He made the vivacious jacket worn by Martin Lawrence in the title credits of his '90s sitcom and the rainbow-striped shell Nascar legend Jeff Gordon raced in. When the Lakers won the NBA championship in 1992, the trophy-stitched jackets Kobe Bryant and team wore were of Mr. Hamilton's creation.</p><p>Constructed by painstakingly layering strips of multicolored leather, Mr. Hamilton's American-made bombers have depicted everything from American flags to Pablo Escobar's smirking visage. They fall somewhere between pop art and streetwear. What Savile Row is for suits, since the 1980s, Mr. Hamilton's office in Los Angeles's fading garment district has been for lurid, see-them-down-Sunset leather jackets.</p><p>\"I spend 10 to 12 hours a day here,\" said the garmento, smiling from behind a desk littered with hand-drawn sketches. \"I'm blessed to be able to do something that I love.\" Today, his semiretirement is officially over: He's collaborating with Missoni and Supreme, making one-off jackets for rappers The Game and Anuel AA and working on a new ready-to-wear apparel line. And with nearly five million followers on Instagram, Mr. Hamilton himself is now as much a celebrity as his clients.</p><p>Born Jeff Bohbot, the designer grew up in France, married at 19 and had two children all before immigrating to California at 24. The relocation was partly inspired by his love of the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>\"I spent a lot of time watching basketball,\" he said. \"I always wanted to realize the American dream.\"</p><p>And he did. While hustling around the city's garment center, Mr. Hamilton regularly rode the elevator with another well-heeled French-speaking fellow: Georges Marciano, one of the brothers behind Guess jeans.</p><p>\"We hit it off,\" said Mr. Hamilton. \"We were always dressed nice, we wore cashmere sweaters and pink socks and loafers\"—departures from the city's flip flops and shorts. (Mr. Hamilton even earned his new name from his distinct appearance: he was often so tan, friends started calling him Jeff Hamilton after the similarly toasted actor George Hamilton.)</p><p>Soon, Mr. Hamilton had the license to design the men's line for Guess. He had no design experience, no green card and spoke no English. But the deal worked: Within three years, he said, the men's label had 400 employees and was doing around $75 million dollars in sales.</p><p>Mr. Hamilton's friendship with the Marcianos withered fast, and with it, his relationship with Guess. (Through a representative, Guess declined to comment on its relationship with Mr. Hamilton.) But his next idea was already in place, driven by a roaring love for motorcycles.</p><p>Throughout the '80s, Mr. Hamilton tooled around the city on a $25,000 \"crazy-fancy\" custom Harley-Davidson wearing extravagant \"Easy Rider\" meets Peter Max jackets, all of his own design. Acquaintances kept asking where they could get one of these for themselves. Mr. Hamilton built his color-mad shells into a bona fide business.</p><p>Celebrities, particularly those with a penchant for panache, came calling. George Michael reached out through a store that stocked Mr. Hamilton's wares and ordered a custom piece. Gutter-mouthed comedian Andrew Dice Clay snatched up several to wear on stage. And Mr. Hamilton met Michael Jordan, and sold him jackets, through Magic Johnson, who had asked the designer to produce coats for some Lakers.</p><p>Mr. Hamilton's relationship with the NBA blossomed into a formal partnership. In 1997, he produced jackets for the league's 50 greatest players in honor of its 50th anniversary, and did it again this year for the league's 75th anniversary. (He signed them, as he signs all the custom jackets.) He hopes to live long enough to do it for the league's 100th.</p><p>His designs became coveted by rappers like LL Cool J and Snoop Dogg and their fans. \"I'm blessed to be respected by their community,\" said Mr. Hamilton, perhaps the rare 60-something to have hung out with Rick Ross, Busta Rhymes and Jim Jones and been namechecked in a song by Cam'ron.</p><p>\"There's levels to the leather jacket—you got the Pelle [Pelle], you got the Avirexes, you got the Vansons, but the big boy was the Jeff Hamilton,\" said Vado, a New York rapper, who first noticed Mr. Hamilton's work in the early 2000s while growing up in Harlem. \"His leathers just was different—it shined more.\"</p><p>Vado's admiration for Mr. Hamilton's jackets is so deep that in 2019 he released a song named after the designer. Before he even met him in person, Mr. Hamilton sent over some jackets for Vado to wear in the video.</p><p>Off-screen, Mr. Hamilton branched out through more-affordable off the rack designs: At their peak, his companies held over 40 licenses to make jackets with official (and oversize) NBA, NHL, Disney, Warner Bros., Betty Boop, Coca-Cola and Nascar iconography.</p><p>Those Nascar jackets, emblazoned with brands like Hot Wheels and Goodwrench, became one of the more enduring trends of the late '90s.</p><p>On the vintage market today, those showy racing shells continue to be big-ticket gems. \"They feel like no other jacket,\" said Phil Spain, 32, a customer service representative in Baltimore who collects Hamilton's Nascar jackets—his prized piece is a Miller Lite logoed design similar to one worn by driver Rusty Wallace. \"Everything is hand-stitched on the jackets…every patch stands out.\"</p><p>Mr. Hamilton sold his wholesale business in the mid-2000s, expecting to fade back from the commercial fashion industry. Then in 2020, he received a fateful Instagram message from A$AP Rocky. The Harlem rapper wanted a custom jacket for the Yams Day concert in Brooklyn.</p><p>Mr. Hamilton didn't have enough time to make a new jacket, so he offered the rapper one from his own closet. Naturally, Rocky selected—and was photographed heavily in—the Lakers championship style that Mr. Bryant wore in the '90s.</p><p>Nine days later, Mr. Bryant died in a helicopter crash. The concert publicity put Mr. Hamilton back in the spotlight. \"I started getting bombarded with people wanting the jacket,\" he said.</p><p>Once again, Mr. Hamilton gave customers what they craved—and more, restarting a full-fledged commercial label. Today, the Jeff Hamilton brand sells all-leather jackets for $6,000 (including that Lakers design for Kobe fans), and $850 wool and leather varsities. The designs will be in 300 department stores and boutiques by next year.</p><p>Aston Martin and Supreme, which featured a kaleidoscopic Hamilton jacket in its latest collection, are collaborating with him, too.</p><p>A new generation of MJs and Madonnas have also found their way to Mr. Hamilton's door. He's made one-off pieces for Drake, DJ Khaled and J. Balvin. He produced jackets commemorating the Weeknd's Super Bowl performance and a DMX memorial piece for Jadakiss.</p><p>Today, custom designs can stretch well into the five figures, but to Mr. Hamilton they're more art than apparel.</p><p>\"You don't need a Jeff Hamilton because you're cold,\" he said. \"You want to make a statement.\"</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>MORE IN ON TREND</p><p>* Why Balenciaga's $1,790 Garbage Bag Is Already a Success</p><p>* Men Are Fanatical About These Pants.
