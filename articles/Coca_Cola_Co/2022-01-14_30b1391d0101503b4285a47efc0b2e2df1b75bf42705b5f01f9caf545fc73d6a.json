  "title": "Business News:  Monster Beverage Buys Owner  Of Multiple Craft Breweries  ----  By Jennifer Maloney",
  "text": "<p>   Monster Beverage Corp. has been mulling a move into booze for years. It finally took the plunge Thursday, becoming the latest big soft-drink company to try its hand at alcoholic beverages. </p><p>   Monster, best known for its namesake energy drinks, said it had forged a deal to buy craft-beer and hard-seltzer company CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC for $330 million. </p><p>   The deal comes as soda makers and alcohol companies move onto one another's turf in bids to spur growth. </p><p>   Constellation Brands Inc. last week said it struck a deal with Coca-Cola Co. to launch canned cocktails under the Fresca soda brand. Last year, Coke introduced an alcoholic version of its Topo Chico seltzer in a partnership with Molson Coors Beverage Co. </p><p>   PepsiCo Inc., meanwhile, is set to roll out an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew in a venture with Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer Co. And Anheuser-Busch InBev SA this month is introducing a line of Bud Light-branded hard soda in cola, cherry-cola, orange and lemon-lime flavors. </p><p>   In 2019, Rodney Sacks, now chairman and co-CEO of Corona, Calif.-based Monster, told shareholders that the company had its sights on hard seltzers, malt beverages and spirits. </p><p>   \"We do have an appetite to look at alternative brands and to develop more beverages in the nonalcoholic . . . as well as the alcoholic market,\" Mr. Sacks said at the time. </p><p>   The CANarchy acquisition includes the Cigar City, Oskar Blues, Deep Ellum, Perrin Brewing, Squatters and Wasatch brands but excludes CANarchy's stand-alone restaurants. </p><p>   Monster said it expects to complete the transaction during the first calendar quarter, adding that the organizational structure for the energy-drinks business will remain unchanged and that CANarchy will function independently. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Colin Kellaher contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
