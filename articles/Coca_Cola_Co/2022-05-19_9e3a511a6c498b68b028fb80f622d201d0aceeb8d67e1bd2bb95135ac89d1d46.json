  "text": "<p>Sunshine spreads across the face of a young girl at the start of <em>The Innocents</em>, the film sent to unnerve us by Norwegian writer-director Eskil Vogt. Then it stays there. The story is set in Nordic midsummer when daylight is all but permanent, night a mere dimming in the small hours. Vogt is best known for writing the script of this year's millennial romance <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a7979cb-a813-4244-84e3-e6a0b40dc496\"><em>The Worst Person in the World</em></a>. Admirers of that film may find this one a surprise, a provocative magic-realist horror movie. But a generational focus is at work here too, in an eerie study of childish things. The title is shared with the 1961 adaptation of <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>; the film may remind you more of the chilly pessimism of <em>The Lord of the Flies</em>, unfolding on a spruce modern housing estate on the edge of Oslo.</p> <p>The girl is Ida, a blonde poppet of nine who spits from balconies, treads on worms, and is quietly unpleasant to her autistic older sister Anna. Her family new to the area, a friendship forms with Ben, a local boy with budding powers of telekinesis. As if responding to a partner in crime, they quickly bloom into a violent extension of his temper. Any sense of consequence is learned much later. Bad seeds grow worse. In the meantime Anna and another girl, Aisha, develop their own psychic connection. Parents are caring but oblivious. Authority comes to rest with the children, that upside-down logic key to the film's shivery, slow-burn appeal.</p> <p>Vogt is a canny visual storyteller. The un-setting sun feels like more than a random flourish, the erasure of night and day a mirror for absent morality. Just as vivid is the blurring of horror with the Proustian stuff of everyday childhood, beautifully rendered: glasses of Coke filled to the brim, the liminal spaces of woods and apartment blocks. The one dubious call is Anna being played by a non-autistic actress in a story that mines emotive drama from the character's condition. The young stars are impressive, but Vogt cannot have meant to unsettle the viewer in quite the way that casting does.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from May 20</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'The Innocents review — Oslo-set story of midsummer magic realism' FT.com 19 May.
