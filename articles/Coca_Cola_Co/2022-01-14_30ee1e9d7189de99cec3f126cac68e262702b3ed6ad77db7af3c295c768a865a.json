  "title": "'Smart City' Chattanooga Names a New CIO; Tyson Morris will succeed Brent Messer in the Tennessee city—which has a 10-gigabit network. 'I'm getting the keys to a very fast car,' Morris says",
  "text": "<p>Tyson Morris, currently global head of architecture, platforms and marketing operations at Coca-Cola Co., will take up the role Feb. 7.</p><p>\"Chattanooga is kind of that dream job,\" Mr. Morris said, adding that he has followed the city's tech projects. \"I'm getting the keys to a very fast car.\"</p><p>Chattanooga, the state's fourth largest city by population, is considered among the most advanced of so-called smart cities, a broad term for cities that use data and technology to improve the way they operate, said Bill Finnerty, research vice president at Gartner Inc.</p><p>The things that make a smart city—advanced analytical tools and internet-connected city infrastructure that can track things like gunshots, traffic or air pollution—have met with varying degrees of success. In 2020, Googlewalked away from a plan to develop a smart city in a Toronto neighborhood, citing economic uncertainty in the pandemic. The project also drew criticism from some local residents over privacy concerns.</p><p>Chattanooga's own smart-city journey began in 2010 when EPB of Chattanooga, the city-owned power distribution and telecommunications company, deployed a gigabit-speed fiber-optic backbone, the first city in the nation to do so on a wide scale. Mr. Messer started as the city's tech chief in February 2014 after holding city- and county-level IT gigs in North Carolina and Florida.</p><p>The network—which supports \"communications among all the devices across the city,\" according to J. Ed. Marston, EPB's vice president of marketing—was improved to offer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second in 2015.</p><p>With the high-speed network in place, the city decided in 2016 to shut its data center and move all its operations to the cloud, an effort led by Mr. Messer. The city now relies on a combination of services from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, he said.</p><p>The move to the cloud also helped make possible Chattanooga's \"Smart Corridor,\" an approximately two-mile long stretch of road with sensor- and camera-enabled traffic lights.</p><p>The goal is to \"retime intersections to help traffic flow better where we do not have such an impact on our air quality,\" said Kevin Comstock, Smart Cities director of Chattanooga and a direct report of Mr. Messer's. So far, the city has seen an overall 18% to 20% reduction in emissions and fuel-economy improvements, he added.</p><p>Another effort under Mr. Messer, who was the city's second CIO, was the introduction of sensors capable of identifying gunshots. Activated by the sensors, cameras will turn on to capture nearby incidents. The city was able to secure convictions on drive-by shootings caught on camera feeds, he said.</p><p>Additionally, the city has a partnership with the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to analyze crime and traffic data, including the data captured by its sensors and cameras.</p><p>\"We can actually use data to predict where crime will be and to put preventative measures in place to prevent it from happening,\" Mr. Messer said. \"And that's been really successful.\"</p><p>Investment in smart-city tech has helped make Chattanooga an attractive place for companies, Mr. Messer said. Among those drawn are large players like Volkswagen and Amazon.com Inc., as well as software startups like Skuid Inc.</p><p>Mr. Morris, the incoming CIO, said the city had done great work setting the infrastructure, moving to the cloud and getting the backing of partners in the community. \"I really hope to build off that,\" he added.</p><p>Write to Isabelle Bousquette at Isabelle.Bousquette@wsj.com</p><p>'Smart City' Chattanooga Names a New CIO</p>",
