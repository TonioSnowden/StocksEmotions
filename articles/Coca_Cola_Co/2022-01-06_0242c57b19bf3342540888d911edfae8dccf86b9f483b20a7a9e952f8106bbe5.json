  "title": "Coca-Cola upgraded as anticipation grows that multibillion-dollar IRS tax case will come to a close",
  "text": "<p>Coca-Cola's KO price target was lifted to $68 from $58.</p><p>The case has been lingering for more than a year, with a November 2020 decision stating that Coca-Cola owed about $3.4 billion in taxes from the years 2007 to 2009. There has been a risk that the company could owe even more as the tax examination continued.</p><p>“In our view, the pending resolution of its IRS tax case (a potential liability of $12B, or a 3.5% increase in its effective tax rate) will lift a major overhang, allowing investors to focus on Coca-Cola's fundamentals and strong underlying momentum from the rebound in on-premise sales and robust pricing environment,” wrote Garrett Nelson in a CFRA note.</p><p>“While the outcome of the tax case remains difficult to handicap, the consequence of an adverse outcome should be largely offset by cash flow from improved concentrate sales and price/mix (+13% and +5%, respectively, in the first three quarters of '21).”</p><p>Read:Cheerios parent General Mills expects supply chain disruptions to further impact price</p><p>JPMorgan, which downgraded Coca-Cola in January 2021 due to the case, upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral in December 2021, citing advantages such as top-line momentum and valuation, even as a final decision on the case looms.</p><p>JPMorgan has a $63 price target on Coca-Cola.</p><p>“[I]f the court rules in favor of the IRS, Coca-Cola will have 180 days to deposit part of the past potential liability in order to appeal (90 days to estimate liability and 90 days to appeal),” JPMorgan analysts wrote.</p><p>“We don't believe this cash need will impact dividends or Coca-Cola's debt rating… As such, we see limited downside potential for Coca-Cola shares at these levels, even if the litigation goes against Coca-Cola, and we think a resolution either positive or negative would remove this overhang.”</p><p>Coca-Cola stock has run up nearly 20% over the last year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 17.7% for the period.</p>",
