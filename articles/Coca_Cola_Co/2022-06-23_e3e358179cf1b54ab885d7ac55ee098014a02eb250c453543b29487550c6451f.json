The analogy holds some water, since unlike more recent financial debacles, there was no <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> to bail out troubled lenders in 1907. </p> <p>Crypto also has no central bank. But it does have the next best thing: <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the 30-year-old billionaire founder of exchange <strong>FTX</strong>, bankrolling struggling crypto companies. </p> <p>Instead of a cascade of defaults, the crypto industry has watched Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69ab1469-df01-4ea2-a015-b0e9904af4cc\">ride to the rescue</a> with $200mn worth of loans from his companies to crypto lenders <strong>BlockFi</strong> and <strong>Voyager</strong>, both of which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d75801c9-b9dd-4f90-b012-6948cca680d0\">had exposure</a> to Three Arrows.</p> <p>The lending streak seems fitting for a benevolent billionaire who, over a vegan lunch at a Bahamian resort, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83bc681a-a0f9-43bb-b627-c6dacae4a0a3\">told the FT's Joshua Oliver</a> of his vision of how crypto can build a more equitable financial system.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried's bro from their Bahamas beachfront conference, <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong>, told Bloomberg: “Sam Bankman-Fried is the new <strong>John Pierpont Morgan</strong> — he is bailing out cryptocurrency markets the way the original JPMorgan did after the crisis of 1907.” (At this point, the jokes write themselves.) </p> <p>Scaramucci, the founder of <strong>SkyBridge Capital</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump's </strong>former White House press secretary for a total of 10 days, has also played his part by telling everyone who will listen that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PC-fL3mV4w\">he's buying more bitcoin and ethereum</a>. </p> <p>Whether Bankman-Fried can use his riches to prevent the crypto meltdown from getting worse remains to be seen, but he has at least managed to press pause on the panic. </p> <h1>Inside the UK government's plan to hatch an Arm IPO in London</h1> <p>The intensity of the UK government's panic about losing Arm to the US market has reached new highs.</p> <p>Officials debated using their new national security powers outlined in the National Security and Investment Act to discourage Japanese conglomerate SoftBank from pursuing an initial public offering solely in New York, sources <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/074940e5-b435-45b2-9144-d246354602f3\">told the FT</a>.</p> <p>The remit of the legislation, which gives the government power to “call in” transactions it reasonably suspects give rise to or may give rise to a risk to national security, has raised concerns in some quarters of the government. </p> <p>Some critics argued that the definition of national security is too vague, allowing the government to bleed “national security” with national interest.</p> <p>Under the regulations, which came into effect in January, the government is able to “impose certain conditions” on a transaction or “block or unwind it completely”.</p> <p>One source said they thought the idea of dangling the power in front of SoftBank was “reckless” but that officials “were genuinely pushing the idea”.</p> <p>In spite of all this wrangling, the majority of lobbying discussions held no threats. Instead, UK officials have been trying for months to entice SoftBank to pursue a listing of Arm in the UK using promises of subsidies on research and grants, people close to the talks said.</p> <p>One person involved in the vast majority of discussions between government officials, SoftBank and Arm said that “there has never been a threat of any kind”, adding that the “conversations we've had have been very co-operative”.</p> <p>But not all SoftBank executives are satisfied with the way things have gone down. Some in the Japanese group's upper ranks were annoyed after becoming aware of the UK government's discussions about potentially using the national security act in the future.</p> <p>The lobbying efforts appear to be working nonetheless. SoftBank is now looking much more favourably at a dual listing for Arm in both New York and London, people close to talks say. </p> <p>Though no final decision has been made, it looks like the UK may yet be able to save some face after all.</p> <h1>Mars offers a taste of its secret formula</h1> <p><strong>Mars</strong> once had a record of secrecy that earned its Virginia headquarters the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/02/mars.wrigley.secretive\"> nickname</a> “the Kremlin”.</p> <p>That reputation has been changing. The confectioner is run by the Mars dynasty — whose estimated $94bn fortune puts them among America's wealthiest families.</p> <p>In recent years, fourth-generation family members and top executives have offered occasional insights into its performance, strategy and culture. On Tuesday, though, Mars gave a more striking<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/302b67a6-5979-49f6-aa55-f288d5baee60\"> glimpse behind the curtain</a>, announcing the retirement of chief executive <strong>Grant Reid </strong>after eight years. </p> <p>The company's annual sales had risen from about $28bn to almost $45bn during Reid's tenure, it said, surpassing those of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> and peers.</p> <p>That roughly 60 per cent sales increase eclipses rivals like <strong>Nestlé</strong>, <strong>Unilever </strong>or <strong>Mondelez</strong>. That's in part because within the 111-year-old group's offices, which sit just a stone's throw from the <strong>CIA'</strong>s headquarters, lies a shrewd group of dealmakers. </p> <p>In 2008 Mars pulled off a $23bn takeover of chewing gum maker <strong>Wrigley</strong>, getting $4.4bn of its financing from another billionaire, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>. Then Buffett's preferred banker, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> alum <strong>Byron Trott</strong>, took on the same role for Mars, advising on its $9.1bn takeover of pet hospital company <strong>VCA</strong> in 2017. </p> <p>Mars's explosive growth at a time when competitors such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e4956d5-837f-4556-a975-83359f5065b8\"><strong>Kraft Heinz</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4c29328-c912-4eec-be19-e26f07bb0148\">now <strong>Kellogg's</strong></a> are slimming down their offerings has created more intrigue over the company's strategy. </p> <p>It has pushed into pet food, which has clearly paid off, as <strong>Poul Weihrauch</strong>, who runs Mars Petcare, has been named as Reid's successor. </p> <p>Reid's growth record, meanwhile, earned him a unique accolade: a public comment from <strong>John Mars</strong>, who waited till the age of 86 to make his first remarks to the media. </p> <p>Reid “was willing to make bold moves but also push back or hold steady when circumstances required it,” the third-generation family member said.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Michel Combes</strong>, the former French telecoms executive who stepped in to replace<strong> Marcelo Claure </strong>as chief executive of SoftBank's international arm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd10c38-10fe-4932-b409-f397bd226674\">earlier this year</a>, is leaving the Japanese investment group just five months after being appointed.
