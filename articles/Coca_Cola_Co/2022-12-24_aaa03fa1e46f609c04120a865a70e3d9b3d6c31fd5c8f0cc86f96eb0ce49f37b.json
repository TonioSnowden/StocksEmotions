  "title": "Wonya Lucas Is Making TV Love Stories for Everyone; The CEO of Hallmark Media believes that 'people want to live in a Hallmark movie'",
  "text": "<p>The Hallmark Channel, the company's cable TV flagship, typically produces over 100 low-budget family-friendly films a year. Around 40 of them are part of its enormously popular Countdown to Christmas programming, which begins in October. These holiday-themed, feel-good love stories generate about a third of Hallmark's annual ad revenue, around $350 million.</p><p>Since Ms. Lucas took over in 2020, Hallmark has made its first films featuring a plus-size heroine, a gay couple and a romance between people with Down syndrome, as well as its first Kwanzaa movie and a couple of Hanukkah films. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Hallmark remained the most watched entertainment cable network in the U.S., reaching over 44 million unique viewers, according to Nielsen data.</p><p>\"This 112-year-old brand leaned into diversity very early,\" Ms. Lucas observes, noting that Hallmark introduced Spanish-language cards and its Mahogany line for African-Americans 35 years ago and sold same-sex marriage cards as early as 2008. \"I'm just translating the essence of the brand into media.\"</p><p>Ms. Lucas's parents set a high bar for career success. Her father, Bill Lucas, played for the Atlanta Braves before becoming the team's general manager in 1976, making him the first Black GM in Major League Baseball. Her mother was an elementary school teacher who later served on the board of Turner Broadcasting System. Both went to college and expected the same of their daughter, who was a mathlete as well as a cheerleader and co-president of her high school senior class.</p><p>Ms. Lucas says she learned from her uncle, baseball legend Hank Aaron, how to handle even the most difficult situations \"with calm and grace.\" Ms. Lucas received death threats when she became general manager of the Weather Channel Networks in the 2000s, and she says she and her two adult daughters are still often treated with suspicion in their posh, mostly white residential neighborhood in Atlanta. She recalls how Aaron fielded death threats as he approached and then surpassed Babe Ruth's home-run record in 1974. \"Despite all the hatred directed towards him, he never hated anyone,\" Ms. Lucas says. \"Seeing how people can hate you that way just for doing your job had a profound effect on me.\"</p><p>In high school Ms. Lucas set her sights on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but ended up studying industrial and systems engineering closer to home at Georgia Tech, in part because her father died suddenly three weeks before she graduated from high school in 1979. \"My mother wasn't in good shape, and I wasn't in good shape either,\" she recalls. She says she drew strength from her Black peers in college, including her freshman roommate, Valerie Montgomery Rice, who is now president of Morehouse School of Medicine. \"We vowed that we would get out together,\" Ms. Lucas says.</p><p>After graduating, Ms. Lucas worked as a product engineer at Westinghouse Electric. \"I could geek out on redesigning the manufacturing process for more efficiency and fewer defects,\" she recalls. \"It was fun.\" To broaden her work beyond engineering, she got an MBA in finance and marketing at the Wharton School, then worked at the Clorox Co. and the Coca-Cola Co., using research and testing to help tailor products to consumers' shifting needs and desires. \"Everything I am doing now at Hallmark I learned at Clorox and Coca-Cola,\" she says. Data, she adds, is her \"love language.\"</p><p>Eager to break into entertainment, she reached out to Turner Broadcasting, where she had been a summer intern after business school. Her old boss Julia Sprunt, the corporate VP of public relations and marketing, arranged interviews with \"every senior leader at the company,\" but no one would take Ms. Lucas on. \"They just said, 'I can't see you fitting in here,'\" she recalls. Ms. Sprunt created a job for Ms. Lucas, who would spend eight years working in marketing research and strategy roles at TNT, TBS and CNN. \"It was a great ride,\" she says.</p><p>It was also an object lesson in corporate hubris. Ms. Lucas recalls a meeting in which she expressed concerns about the growing popularity of a nascent CNN rival called Fox News but was told not to worry. \"People said, 'We're the world's news leader, Wonya.' But the rest is history.\"</p><p>Ms. Lucas went on to serve in top leadership roles at the Weather Channel, the Discovery Channel and Public Broadcasting Atlanta, a local NPR and PBS station, where she was president and CEO from 2015 to 2020 and increased younger listeners by 25%. \"I learned how to be scrappy with resources,\" she says.</p><p>Hallmark tapped Ms. Lucas at a tense time for the company. Her predecessor, Bill Abbott, was nudged out in early 2020 after facing criticism for his decision to pull an ad featuring a same-sex couple. He has since created his own more traditional rival network, Great American Family, and has poached a few of Hallmark's top stars, such as Candace Cameron Bure and Danica McKellar. Hallmark still enjoys a healthy lead in the holiday ratings, and its recent \"Three Wise Men and a Baby\" ranks as the most-watched cable TV movie of 2022.</p><p>Still, Ms. Lucas is wary of overconfidence. \"When I was at TNT we were number one, at CNN number one. When I was at Discovery we were number one. And honestly, none of them are that anymore,\" she observes. \"You have to evolve, you can't stay in the same place, but you need to bring your core audience with you.\"</p><p>At other brands, it was often Ms. Lucas's job to build an emotional connection with consumers. At Hallmark, she says, that bond is already there. \"There's something about the positivity and emotional safety, that everything's going to work out in the end, that really uplifts people,\" she says of the network's reassuringly formulaic love stories. She notes that branded Hallmark wines and Hallmark \"Countdown to Christmas\" holiday suites at Hilton and Wyndham hotels often sell out. \"We're unlike any brand in TV, and I've worked on a lot of them,\" she says. \"People want to live in a Hallmark movie.\"</p><p>Ms. Lucas hopes that Hallmark's new emphasis on more diverse, more \"culturally authentic\" stories will draw more viewers without compromising its appeal to longtime fans. \"For us it is about showing that there are common elements to every love story, regardless of who you are,\" she says. \"I mean, we all want love, right?\"</p><p>Wonya Lucas Is Making TV Love Stories for Everyone</p>",
