  "text": "<p>   Milton Friedman argued that a corporate executive's responsibility is to maximize profits while conforming to the basic rules of society, as embodied in law and \"ethical custom.\" American corporations donated $21 billion to charity in 2019, but the growing \"stakeholder capitalism\" movement is using the ethical-custom concept to impose a progressive agenda on American businesses. It will have negative implications for investor returns. </p><p>   If you bought stock in a company whose management embraced stakeholder capitalism, or invested in a fund that includes such companies, you also invested in their definition of what is good for society. That definition can be found in \"environmental, social and governance\" (ESG) investment criteria that place progressive agenda items on par with, if not above, a business's obligation to maximize returns. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 has become a hot mess of ESG costs, policies and requirements. It now consists of companies focused more on ideology than shareholder value. This seems to be fine with the world's largest asset managers, who \"are signing on to sustainability codes, publishing ESG papers and voting policies, and paying for rating providers,\" according to shareholder advisory firm SquareWell Partners. </p><p>   It can be an expensive trend. Investment firms have been known to threaten adverse proxy votes when companies fail to implement costly green initiatives. Large banks have committed to spending tens of billions of dollars \"to advance racial equity.\" Some retailers have ended profitable firearms sales. These ideological decisions are in effect business taxes that can diminish shareholder returns and alienate consumers. </p><p>   While investors are free to do what they choose with their money, many object to progressives' use of corporate governance to advance their agenda. Recent polling and election results indicate that about half the country feels that way. As stakeholder capitalism gains steam, conservatives, libertarians, and Reagan Democrats have had little choice but to read the headlines in frustration. </p><p>   The CEOs of Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines spoke out against Georgia's new voting law, leading to calls for costly boycotts of both brands. More than 100 corporate leaders echoed this opposition on a Zoom call last weekend. Did these CEOs put their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders first by considering the damage to their brands, the loss of business and reputational harm? A recent Morning Consult poll found that 42% of Americans support Georgia's new voting law, while only 36% oppose it. </p><p>   I broadly support diversity and inclusion, and I am not advocating only for projects with high returns, but it is important for investors to understand the trade-offs when management teams pursue the ESG agenda. Financial research company 2ndVote Inc. performs a full social audit of every company in the S&amp;P 1500, analyzing their advocacy, philanthropy, corporate statements and legislative support to determine the quality, quantity, type and extent of a corporation's social activism. To give you some idea of how ESG-focused the S&amp;P 500 has become, 73% of the companies the index includes are either \"liberal\" or \"lean liberal\" according to 2ndVote Inc. The remaining 27% are rated \"neutral.\" None of the S&amp;P 1500 companies that 2ndVote Inc. analyzes rate \"conservative\" or \"lean conservative.\" </p><p>   At 2ndVote Advisers -- which is affiliated with, but not owned by, 2ndVote Inc. -- we take the 1,000 largest companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and screen out those ranked as \"liberal\" or \"lean liberal\" by 2ndVote Inc. Then we select the companies we believe offer the best potential for superior long-term returns. We focus on profits, not politics. Our strategy is based on the notion that businesses focused on profits will be more profitable than businesses that aren't. </p><p>   Although nobody can guarantee future returns, the data support our approach. The average annual five-year return for the 2ndVote First Amendment Large-Cap Index (21.94%) outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 (15.88%) and the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index (15.99%, the first index based solely on ESG criteria). An investment of $1,000 in the 2ndVote index made in 2015 would be worth $2,697 today. That same investment in the S&amp;P 500 would have grown only to $2,089. Investing in the KLD400 would have yielded $2,099. </p><p>   Companies that value profits over politics are far more ethical and healthy for society. 2ndVote Advisers is seeking a return to the halcyon days of traditional shareholder capitalism by investing in companies that serve the interests of all their stakeholders by generating profits. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Grant is CEO of 2ndVote Advisers. </p><p></p>",
