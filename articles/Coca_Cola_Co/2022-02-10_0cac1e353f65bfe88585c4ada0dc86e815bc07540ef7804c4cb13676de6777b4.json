  "title": "How there's been a Greenspan-sized tightening to the economy even before the first Fed hike",
  "text": "<p>That seems like a silly question. Interest rates are still barely above zero, and this month, the Fed is still planning to buy $20 billion of Treasury securities and another $10 billion in mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>But that isn't how markets are behaving. And economists at Deutsche Bank say there's some validity to the idea that the Fed is actually tightening right now, before it makes its first interest-rate hike.</p><p>Their shadow rate — a model first introduced in 2019 that maps the signals from the yield curve into a fed funds equivalent rate — has risen 85 basis points over the past three months. That would rank in the top 5% of historical moves, say the Deutsche Bank economists.</p><p>“The recent rise moved the shadow rate into positive territory for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. This movement can be interpreted as the yield curve's signal about how the monetary policy stance has adjusted in recent months,” say economists led by Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist.</p><p>A more widely followed “shadow rate,” called the Wu-Xia shadow rate, has climbed 1.5 percentage points since October, the sharpest three-month rise since 1994, though that measure is still not in positive territory.</p><p>“The upshot is that while a lot of work remains to be done in tightening financial conditions through a more restrictive monetary stance, through its recent pivot the Fed has been able to already kick-start that process,” say the Deutsche Bank economists.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Nada. Zip. Zilch. China bought none of the extra $200 billion of U.S. exports it promised in the deal it signed with the Trump administration, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Bown did allow that the deal wasn't a total washout, as it halted the spiraling trade war, and China did remove technical barriers to U.S. farm exports and pledged to respect intellectual property and open up its financial services sector.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Coming in hotter than forecast, U.S. consumer price growth stayed at 0.6% in January, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. Core price growth stayed at 0.6%. Over the last 12 months, prices have gained 7.5%.</p><p>U.S. stock futuresES00NQ00 slumped after the hotter-than-forecast CPI reading, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Yclimbed to 1.97%.</p><p>Jobless claims meanwhile fell to 223,000 from 239,000.</p><p>Russia and Belarus started a joint military drill, as the world fears an invasion of neighboring Ukraine.</p><p>Walt Disney Co. DIS jumped 8% in preopen trade, after it reported much stronger-than-expected earnings, helped by a jump in theme-park revenue as Disney+ subscription numbers also came in ahead of estimates.</p><p>Twilio TWLO shares leapt 19%, after the communications software company beat on earning expectations and forecast it will be profitable next year. Uber Technologies UBER also is seen rising after reporting revenue ahead of estimates, with gross bookings toward the high end of its projected range.</p><p>Twitter TWTR rose 5% as the social-media company announced a $4 billion stock buyback and in-line fourth-quarter results.</p><p>Beverage makers Coca-Cola KO and PepsiCo PEP both edged higher after their fourth-quarter results.</p><p>Video-sharing platform Vimeo VMEO dropped 20% after forecasting slower revenue growth this year.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers as of 6 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Ticker  Security name  GME     GameStop  AMC     AMC Entertainment  TSLA    Tesla  FB      Meta Platforms  NIO     NIO  DIS     Walt Disney  AAPL    Apple  NVDA    Nvidia  AMZN    Amazon.com  BABA    Alibaba</p><p>Random reads</p><p>Millennials just aren't into wine, and U.S. producers are panicking.</p><p>A painting insured for about $1 million was vandalized by a bored security guard.</p><p>Does ice fishing lead to…prostitution?
