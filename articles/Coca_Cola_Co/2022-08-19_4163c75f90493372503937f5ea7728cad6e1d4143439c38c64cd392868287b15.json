  "title": "Furniture Rental Baron Found a Way to Get Rich Slowly; Charlie Loudermilk, who has died at age 95, established Aaron's chain to supply sofas, TV sets and even a punch bowl he received as a wedding gift",
  "text": "<p>Retailers could buy folding chairs for $10, sell them for $20 and book an immediate profit. A rental firm could recoup its investment in chairs only gradually, in installments. The cash flow wasn't sufficient to fund expansion. Banks were reluctant to provide loans when the collateral was banged-up chairs.</p><p>Mr. Loudermilk, who died Aug. 3 after a stroke at the age of 95, worked long hours and often had to scramble. When demand for rented punch bowls exceeded his supply, he once had to dash home and grab a silver bowlâ€”one of his wife's favorite wedding gifts.</p><p>It was 27 years before Aaron's was ready to sell stock to the public, giving Mr. Loudermilk a major financial boost and the wherewithal to match his address in Atlanta's tony Buckhead neighborhood. The struggles continued. Furniture rental was never going to be a prestigious business.</p><p>Often, Mr. Loudermilk told the Atlanta Business Chronicle, \"you're dealing with people who have not handled their money or their life responsibly. You have to go and repossess things.\"</p><p>In a 2011 memoir, \"Charlie,\" Mr. Loudermilk wrote that he never would have gone into the rental business if he had realized how difficult it would be and how much stress it would put on himself and his family.</p><p>Yet furniture rental made Mr. Loudermilk a civic leader and philanthropist in Atlanta. It also gave him a bit part in history when his company rented tents to civil rights demonstrators led by Martin Luther King Jr. during the march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965. Wary of controversy, Mr. Loudermilk had the tents delivered in a Hertz truck rather than one emblazoned with his brand name.</p><p>Though he was a conservative Republican, Mr. Loudermilk was one of the few white business leaders who publicly supported Andrew Young, a Black Democrat, when he ran successfully for mayor of Atlanta in 1981. Mr. Young, who had already served in Congress and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recalled in an interview that he sought Mr. Loudermilk's help.</p><p>\"I could win without the business community,\" Mr. Young said, \"but I could not run the city without the business community.\" Mr. Loudermilk \"caught a lot of hell\" from white business leaders for supporting the Young campaign but laughed it off, the former mayor said. After the election, Mr. Loudermilk helped organize a lunch giving business leaders a chance to meet the mayor.</p><p>Robert Charles Loudermilk, known as Charlie, was born July 12, 1927, and grew up in Atlanta. His father worked on electrical lines for Georgia Power. His mother managed school cafeterias before becoming a restaurant owner.</p><p>Though he wore overalls and sometimes went barefoot, young Charlie dreamed of becoming President of the U.S. or at least a millionaire. Meanwhile, he sold bottles of Coca-Cola on a sidewalk to pay for movies and pinball.</p><p>Other Obituaries</p><p>* Corning CEO Shifted Focus From Cookware to Photonics</p><p>* Hanae Mori, Fashion Designer Beloved by Princesses and First Ladies, Dies at 96</p><p>* Wolfgang Petersen, Director of 'Das Boot' and 'Air Force One,' Dies at 81</p><p>He learned to box, played high school football and enrolled at Georgia Tech, where he floundered. After a brief stint in the Navy, he switched to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In Chapel Hill, unlike in Atlanta, no one knew he came from the wrong side of the tracks. He was jovial and remembered people's names. That helped make him a leader in student government and chairman of the Interfraternity Council.</p><p>He was a good-time Charlie. \"A couple of times I got so drunk that I had to be taken to the hospital,\" he wrote. At one point, a student newspaper reported that Mr. Loudermilk was \"going to try studying a while after participating in virtually every other activity on campus.\"</p><p>Skipping classes got him kicked out of school. Furious, he vowed to abandon his education, until an alumni-association leader talked sense into his head. He graduated with a degree in business in 1950.</p><p>In the early 1950s, he thrived as a salesman for makers of milk and pharmaceuticals. Then he returned to Atlanta to help his mother run restaurants.</p><p>Wanting his own show, he recalled hearing about rental companies. When he tried renting out chairs, he found himself competing with funeral parlors that didn't need their folding chairs every day. He had better luck with party items, including tablecloths and punch bowls, along with wheelchairs and hospital beds.</p><p>The booming Atlanta economy brought in people who needed to furnish temporary apartments with sofas and TV sets. Because he couldn't rely on furniture factories to deliver fast enough, he set up his own furniture plants. Franchising allowed him to create a national rental chain.</p><p>A major rival, Rent-A-Center Inc., popped up in 1986. To stay competitive, Mr. Loudermilk adopted the rent-to-own model, under which customers own the furniture or appliances if they keep making monthly payments long enough.</p><p>A study by the Federal Trade Commission in 2000 reported that rent-to-own could mean paying two to three times the retail price. The agency found that most customers were poor and 73% had a high school education or less. Around three-quarters said they were satisfied with their rent-to-own transactions.</p><p>Mr. Loudermilk is survived by three children and five grandchildren. Two marriages ended in divorce.</p><p>He and Andrew Young often disagreed on issues but never tired of talking about politics. Their mutual respect endured. Shortly before Mr. Loudermilk died in a hospital, Mr. Young stopped by for one last visit.</p><p>Write to James R.
