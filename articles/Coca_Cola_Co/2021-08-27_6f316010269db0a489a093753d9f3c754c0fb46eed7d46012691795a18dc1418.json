  "text": "<p><strong>We have a cellar that is about to be tanked and made good. I'm hoping to turn it into a speakeasy/cocktail bar. The ceiling will be about 6ft high when the floor is replaced and it will have two windows at head height (ground level outside). Any suggestions?</strong>&#xa0;</p> <p>A brilliant idea! I rather fancy the idea of designing a bar. Of course, the look would all depend on location, inspiration and desired atmosphere. I'm enthralled by the idea of a tiny place on a backstreet in Milan: I see a stainless steel bar, pale green napkins and glittering chats. </p> <p>But I'd also love to do something gloomy in a larger city — all dark wood, club chairs and hazy amber light. A place for strong drinks and secret liaisons. An English country pub would, naturally, be a dream to design. And how about a tiny mirrored pocket in Venice for <em>cicchetti</em> and spritzes?</p> <p>How fun to recreate a bar in one's own home, then. Where to look for inspiration? Is the vibe you're wanting to create all martinis and mirrors, or hobbity pints and open fires? </p> <p>You say you're thinking along the lines of a speakeasy. Speakeasy bars first came into prominence in 1920s America, when new laws banned the sale of alcohol, resulting in an illicit underground drinking scene.</p> <p>Springing immediately to mind, therefore, is Milk &amp; Honey, a bar in London that sadly closed its doors in 2020. I last visited many years ago, but I've been enjoying rediscovering pictures of its interiors. Leather and velvet armchairs sit on faded 1970s carpets, Art Deco mirrors reflect mahogany panelling and the ceiling's tarnished tin tiles.</p> <p>Tin ceilings, very popular in Victorian buildings in North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were an affordable alternative to the exquisite plasterwork found in European homes. Surely a must for your cellar bar? </p> <p>There are plenty of places to find ideas: Tramps, founded in 1995, stocks a huge variety of weird bits and bobs, with a focus on vintage Americana. The company also sells new and vintage <a href=\"https://tinceilingtiles.co.uk/new-tin-tiles/pattern-01/\">tin tiles</a>. The new tiles come in a variety of patterns and many finishes.</p> <p>You'll need chairs for you and your guests to sink into with an enormous drink. I'm not a fan of bulbous, flabby leather armchairs. I'd much rather something a bit more tailored and plush, upholstered, perhaps, in a <br>jewel-toned velvet or mohair. </p> <p>Look to the London-based furniture designer Amy Somerville for inspiration: I love the company's <a href=\"https://www.amysomerville.com/furniture/quinaquina-swivel-chair/\">Quinaquina swivel chair</a> with its octagonal shape and walnut base, while its Dyad armchair looks supremely comfortable. Both are more luxurious than you might find in your average speakeasy, but this is your home after all.</p> <p>Storage-wise, a chic bar cabinet would make sense for glassware. An old Fornasetti cabinet would, for certain, be high up on my top 10 list of items of furniture I'd like to own. I found a <a href=\"https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/storage-case-pieces/cabinets/trellis-cabinet-on-stand-piero-fornasetti-1950s/id-f_12437601/\">trellis cabinet</a> from the 1950s on 1stdibs, with a caning pattern on an ivory lacquered ground. It's a beautiful piece.</p> <p>I like the idea of a bar in a cupboard, hidden behind a secret door, particularly when its interior is decked out in deep lacquer. The idea here would be to mimic the feeling of opening a jewellery box, except the surprise within is a big old drink.</p> <p>What else? Bar stools, if we're doing things properly. There is a great <a href=\"https://www.pamono.co.uk/bar-stool-in-metal-and-leather-czechoslovakia-1950s\">set </a>on Pamono, made in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. Upholstered in bright emerald green leather, they'd look dazzling against dark walls. Chocolate brown gloss, perhaps? Dark walls are a good bet: they'll intensify the feeling of secret cellar cosiness.</p> <p>I also like the idea of a wallpaper — something cosseting and dark, perhaps, and botanical or geometric in design. <a href=\"https://nicholashaslam.com/shop/fabrics-wallpaper/boiserie-collection/boiserie-rovere/\">Paolo Moschino</a> for Nicholas Haslam sells a collection of wallpapers inspired by wood carving, made in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.sanpatrignano.org/en/\">San Patrignano</a>, a community project that has been helping people with addiction problems for more than 40 years.</p> <p>You will need a good dose of miscellaneous bar tat, too. Not too much, though — avoid walls covered in old Coca-Cola signs, but a few interesting and decorative bits here and there would be amusing. Reclamation experts <a href=\"https://www.lassco.co.uk/product/a-novelty-hanging-sign-in-cast-plaster/\">Lassco</a> usually has some old signs and reverse painted mirrors in stock.</p> <p>A good bar is more than just nice chairs and taxidermy fish in cases, though. I'm thinking back to a weekend I spent at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor a few winters ago. The interior of this much-loved hotel is, for me, just perfect: faded and cluttered, homely and comfortable. It's the kind of place you want to pull up a stool to the bar and settle in for the night. What more could you hope for from a drinking establishment?
