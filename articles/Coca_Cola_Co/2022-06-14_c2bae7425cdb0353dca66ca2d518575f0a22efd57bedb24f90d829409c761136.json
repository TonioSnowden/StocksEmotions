  "title": "Business News:  Coke, Jack Daniel's to Sell Canned Cocktail  ----  By Jennifer Maloney",
  "text": "<p>   Jack and Coke are making it official. </p><p>   The classic bar cocktail, a combination of Jack Daniel's whiskey and Coca-Cola, will be rolling out in premixed cans around the world, starting in Mexico later this year, the drink's makers said Monday. </p><p>   The drink will contain about 5% alcohol, though that will vary depending on the market, Brown-Forman Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. said. They will also sell a version with no sugar. </p><p>   Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo Inc. have been expanding into alcoholic drinks. </p><p>   Coke has introduced Topo Chico hard seltzer and Simply Spiked Lemonade, created in a partnership with Molson Coors Beverage Co. </p><p>   Coke also made a deal with Constellation Brands Inc. to introduce a line of canned cocktails under the Fresca brand. </p><p>   PepsiCo is making an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew in a partnership with Boston Beer Co. And the brewer of Bud Light is making hard seltzers with soda flavors. </p><p>   The product launches are the latest in a series of crossover ventures as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another's turf in search of growth. </p><p>   Consumer demand has soared over the past few years for nonalcoholic seltzers and alcoholic ones such as White Claw that are low on calories and offer just a hint of flavor. Now some consumers are migrating toward stronger flavors, industry experts say, and brewers are trying out new fizzy drinks. </p><p>    Canned cocktails are a smaller but fast-growing segment, as drinkers look for a convenient way to re-create a bar experience at home or just on the go. Industry tracker IWSR estimates that U.S. volumes of spirit-based premixed drinks increased 53% last year from a year earlier, double the rate of malt-based hard seltzers. </p><p>   Jim Beam owner Beam Suntory Inc. and Bacardi Ltd. have begun selling premixed cocktails. Diageo PLC has rolled out ready-to-drink products under its Crown Royal whisky and Ketel One vodka brands. </p><p></p>",
