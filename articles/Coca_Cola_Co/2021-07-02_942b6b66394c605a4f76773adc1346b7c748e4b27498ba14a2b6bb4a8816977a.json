  "text": "<h2>Teneo's top spin master gets trapped in the news cycle</h2> <p>It took <strong>Declan Kelly </strong>and <strong>Doug Band </strong>a decade to build <strong>Teneo</strong> into the go-to advisory group for CEOs looking to navigate — or, better still, avoid — a career-threatening reputational crisis.&#xa0;</p> <p>But within six months, both were hit with the types of calamity they tried to help their clients see off, costing them their jobs and throwing the future of the company into doubt.</p> <p>Some DD readers may have never heard of Teneo until now, but they've certainly come across <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, the private equity firm that invested $450m into the company, and the roster of A-listers who it depends on for advice.&#xa0;</p> <p>Among its special advisers in the US are <strong>Ginni Rometty</strong>, recently released from <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>Ursula Burns</strong>, the former <strong>Xerox</strong> chief executive, and <strong>Andrew Liveris</strong>, the one-time <strong>Dow Chemical </strong>boss who sits on the board of <strong>Saudi Aramco</strong>. Former cabinet members like <strong>William Hague </strong>and<strong> Amber Rudd</strong>, are among those opening doors for it in the UK.&#xa0;</p> <p>Band, a former aide to <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, brought A-list Washington connections, while Kelly had an Irish-American network and a talent for wooing CEOs of big companies from <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37f8b75-f29f-4f6f-83d3-b9e559a2c79e\"><strong>General Motors</strong></a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That let them charge eye-popping monthly retainers of $250,000 to $1m even outside the times when clients were in the midst of a deal or a scandal. And as the fees grew, so did their company, to 1,250 people and almost $400m in revenues.&#xa0;</p> <p>Together they generated the sort of publicity that most public relations groups try to shy away from.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/confessions-of-a-clintonworld-exile\">interview</a> with Vanity Fair, where Band described his bitter break-up with the Clintons, which would ultimately be his downfall.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kelly's departure was triggered by his behaviour at a celebrity event hosted by<strong> Global Citizen</strong>, a non-profit that aims to eradicate world poverty, where he is alleged to have inappropriately touched six women. Kelly, who sits on the charity's board and is close to its founder <strong>Hugh Evans</strong>, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f555d441-82eb-4215-8f09-a5496d339870\">swiftly removed</a> from his post.</p> <p>Yet as detailed in<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7412f910-3043-466c-a3a8-74132713cf7d\"> this Big Read</a> by the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and DD's Arash Massoudi, Ortenca Aliaj, James Fontanella-Khan and Sujeet Indap, trouble was brewing behind closed doors at Teneo long before the allegations of Kelly's misconduct surfaced.</p> <p>CVC had been split over the reputational risks of investing in Teneo, the story reveals, and some of its sharper-elbowed tactics had become fodder for lawsuits.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>A court <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=310020\">case</a> stemming from <strong>Anthem</strong>'s $54bn bid for rival health insurer and Teneo client <strong>Cigna</strong> best encapsulates Teneo's methods: the presiding Delaware judge noted the group was “skilled in the darker arts of influencing the media and public discourse” following its attempt to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56a0e9e2-ee6a-11e6-930f-061b01e23655\">sabotage the deal</a>.</p> <p>Teneo had conducted a “covert communications campaign”, the judge said, publicly maintaining that the deal was on track while leaking documents showing the opposite was true. (Teneo also went hunting for a back issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine which featured Anthem's chief executive smoking, which it hoped would “hurt his credibility as a healthcare CEO”.)</p> <p>But none of Teneo's tactics managed to prevent Kelly's indiscretions from becoming public.&#xa0;</p> <p>As one executive put it: “He had a stable of experts who could have dealt with this in a more effective way; instead he opted for a cover-up.”</p> <p>Teneo still has a deep bench of experts, as it has hastened to assure clients, but they may first need to explain why Teneo failed to emerge from its own reputational crisis unscathed.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Elliott plays hardball in boardroom battle with GSK&#xa0;</h2> <p>In April <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d64eff-7cfb-4f73-9a48-45857640f9a9\">we told</a> you that activist investor <strong>Elliott Management </strong>took a multibillion-pound stake in <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>. </p> <p>On Thursday&#xa0;Elliott called on GSK to refresh its board with new directors and launch a process&#xa0;to decide whether&#xa0;it's&#xa0;chief&#xa0;<strong>Emma Walmsley</strong>&#xa0;is fit to lead the company.</p> <p>Elliott's 17-page letter to GSK, the hedge fund's first public confirmation of its stake in the healthcare company since the FT broke the news months ago, criticises “years of under-management” for its poor share price performance.</p> <p>“Allowing GSK's long-term operational and share-price underperformance to persist without urgently taking appropriate measures would disappoint all with an interest in the company. The board must rise to the challenge and put forth a more ambitious plan to close the gap,” Elliott wrote to GSK chair<strong> Jonathan Symonds</strong>.</p> <p>Walmsley has pushed back against such criticisms, telling the FT's Hannah Kuchler in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b36d9f8e-c05d-4efe-9352-43a2fc5208f8\">interview</a> last week that she was a “change agent” committed to transforming GSK into an innovative home for breakthrough medicines.</p> <p>Since that interview she has refused to answer questions about her leadership, but as Elliott ratchets up the pressure, Walmsley may soon be forced to acknowledge the elephant in the room.</p> <h2>Define ‘conflict of interest'</h2> <p>Omitting information isn't a crime.</p> <p>Just ask Europe's largest software company <strong>SAP</strong>, which declined to disclose that its billionaire chair and biggest shareholder, <strong>Hasso Plattner</strong>, had a personal connection to a joint venture announced earlier this year worth hundreds of millions of euros.</p> <p>The deal in question, a spin-off of SAP's financial services arm between SAP and the Munich-based private equity firm <strong>Dediq</strong>, also involved one more secret investor: the <strong>Hasso Plattner Foundation</strong>.</p> <p>The stake had been a secret, until the FT and the German business paper Handelsblatt reported its existence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed67bbe5-cabb-47fb-923f-04aec6953727\">in May</a>. At the time, SAP and the foundation insisted it was all a fuss about nothing.</p> <p>Now that it's all out in the open, the $145bn company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9afe3e1e-6396-4cbb-9145-ed52c67e8341\">has promised</a> to no longer do deals with Plattner's foundation, and the foundation has agreed to divest its stake in the controversial joint venture, the FT's Joe Miller and Kadhim Shubber tell us.</p> <p>After pressure from investors and investigations by<strong> Duff &amp; Phelps</strong> and <strong>Gleiss Lutz</strong> — who SAP said found that all was above board — the tone is now somewhat different.&#xa0;</p> <p>And it seems that Platter's foundation has also changed its tune: “We recognise . . . that what is legally correct may not always be legitimate in the eyes of all stakeholders,” it said.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Khalid al-Dabbagh</strong> is stepping down as chief financial officer of <strong>Saudi Aramco</strong>. He will be replaced by <strong>Ziad al-Murshed</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/finance-chief-who-steered-saudi-aramco-through-ipo-to-step-down?sref=OziMsGoK\">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Kantar</strong>, the global market data business owned by the private equity group <strong>Bain Capital</strong>, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4488fdff-2041-42ec-8597-0b0c08d64920\">hired</a> <strong>Chris Jansen </strong>as its chief executive.
