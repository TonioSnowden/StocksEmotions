  "text": "<p>There is a degree of hatred involved in my inviting a person to eat. It isn't really about the washing up after the guests have gone. It's not about social faux pas either, although that's what I will grumble about after the last dish is dried.</p> <p>The situation is this: for as long as I have wanted to be close to people, I have needed to be free to hate them. In the case of dinner parties, this manifests as a kind of fearful resentment that makes the evening fraught and me an unwilling host. This prickliness embarrasses me. “If I can't be gracious,” I often think, “I shouldn't be anything at all.”</p> <p>It was only by chance, then, that my fantasy dinner party even happened. I was wandering alone one day, my mind as thick as soup, when I stepped into the path of psychotherapist Donald Winnicott as he was cycling to work. Rather than being angry, he laid an elfin hand on my shoulder and said I looked like I needed a party. We need hate to love, he explained. Even parents hate their babies, sometimes, and what is a parent if not the original host? Once you accept you'll begrudge your guests, just a little, you'll be free to enjoy their company too. We began to draw up plans.</p> <p>That's how Winnicott and I have ended up in the assembly hall of my old secondary school on a blue-black autumn evening. What better place, in what better company, to battle old demons? He has offered to serve the food and recommended a colleague, psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, to pour drinks. She refuses to serve the peanut punch over ice that I requested and instead produces bottles of Tokay, a sweet Hungarian wine, that she stole from a conference last week.</p> <p>All day, Winnicott has been spinning through the room like a sprite, suspending tiny glowing orbs and lengths of peach-coloured silk across the hall until everything is sweet and bathed in light. When author <strong>Toni Morrison</strong> walks in she gasps and pretends not to notice the smell of damp coats and old trainers from the locker room.</p> <p>Writer and composer <strong>Francis Bebey</strong> has arrived too and is singing a song as expansive as laughter. The room feels full. At first I feel a familiar prickling of resentment. (Why should you force me to dance? Or to feel?) But then Morrison begins to sway, and writer <strong>Grace Paley</strong> enters, bellowing and swinging her hips, and I allow my body to move.</p> <p>Winnicott is circulating on roller blades with a tray of tsofi, Ghanaian fried turkey tail. By the time we sit for dinner, greasy-fingered and glistening with sweat, he has laid out a spread of McDonald's double cheeseburgers and prawn-stuffed tofu and aubergine, from Wong Kei in London's Chinatown. There are bowls of steamed rice. There are fish finger sandwiches. None of it makes sense but each thing is perfect because it is exactly what it is supposed to be.</p> <p>Paley is weaving stories between mouthfuls of silken aubergine and we are all rapt, which distracts us from our thirst. (I'd thought that psychotherapists, who are in the business of veiling their true feelings around difficult people, might be natural waiters, but Klein has spent the past couple of hours asking my guests, with barely concealed glee, about their mothers.) I decide I should serve the remaining drinks myself — champagne for those who want it, vanilla Coke for the rest.</p> <p>We have nearly finished by the time <strong>Truman Capote</strong> arrives. Sat at the head of the table, he reclines in his chair and fixes his gaze on us, holding a bowl of La Grotta ice cream (Puglia lemon, topped with a rococo cloud of whipped cream) like a brandy glass in one hand while gesticulating with the other. At first he is scintillating, then terrible. Morrison rolls her eyes at Bebey, who kicks me under the table. But just when we are on the brink of hating him, he slides drily into a wicked anecdote about someone we loathe. “How darling,” we all laugh. “How bitchy.”</p> <p>As the night condenses around us, Morrison tells us a ghost story and reminds us that all the good and the bad is here at once, that there's no pulling apart the threads of a life. A final guest is summoned from the shadows: the fictional <strong>Toni Erdmann</strong>, spirited in from the film of the same name, in a huge Bulgarian kukeri costume and carrying a tray of Cadbury's Creme Eggs. In the film, he is a father who adopts a series of increasingly extravagant disguises to find a way into the heart of his jaded adult daughter. He is indecipherable, just absurd enough to break through her prickliness and entice her to have fun. Amid the debris of the evening we stare at him, hating him for a moment, then laughing, and we invite him to dance.</p> <p><em>Ruby Tandoh is a food writer and the author of books including “Cook As You Are: Recipes for Real Life, Hungry Cooks and Messy Kitchens”</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Ruby Tandoh 2022 'Ruby Tandoh's fantasy dinner: a hate-spiked dance party in the food writer's old assembly hall' FT.com 27 August.
