  "text": "<p>\"The entire Russian government protested it,\" he said of the ad, directed by Joe Sedelmaier. \"How much more reaction can you get than that?\"</p><p>His late-1990s ad for an internet retailer showed fake gerbils being blasted out of a cannon. One of his ads for Mike's Hard Lemonade depicted a lumberjack accidentally chopping off one of his feet—and made the incident just another pretext for drinking the product. His antic ads for the Little Caesars pizza chain included one in which a pizza box turns into a pterodactyl.</p><p>\"Almost all our clients are Davids up against Goliaths,\" he told New York magazine in 1993. \"We have to win with wit.\"</p><p>Mr. Freeman, who died Sept. 5 at the age of 80, ran his own New York boutique, Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners, after working for larger agencies.</p><p>Among his admirers is Keith Reinhard, chairman emeritus of DDB Worldwide, who was doing work for McDonald's when Mr. Freeman was promoting Wendy's. \"What he demonstrated,\" Mr. Reinhard said, \"was that slapstick, bizarre humor and wild exaggeration not only can cut through the clutter but also create massive goodwill for a brand and lift sales.\"</p><p>Mr. Freeman \"didn't care about being politically correct,\" Mr. Reinhard said. \"I think we could use a little bit of that irreverence today.\"</p><p>Mr. Freeman had his share of misfires, including a 2002 ad for Midas, the automotive-services chain, featuring an elderly woman revealing her upper torso to a counter clerk. Midas yanked the ad off the air after three weeks.</p><p>\"It was inappropriate, and it wasn't right for them,\" Mr. Freeman told The Wall Street Journal in 2003. \"We didn't give Midas what they needed—a great business strategy.\" He added that he was still learning and growing. \"I still can't get over the fact that I have an agency with my name on it,\" he said.</p><p>Being offensive wasn't the only risk in advertising, Mr. Freeman said. \"To me creative risks are when you do the usual, the obvious and the boring thing,\" he said. \"That is when you get the nonreaction, and that is when you are flushing money down the toilet.\"</p><p>Clifford Lee Freeman was born Feb. 14, 1941, in Vicksburg, Miss., and grew up mostly in St. Petersburg, Fla. His parents operated motels and a dairy business. As a boy, he helped out at the motels and worked at a soda fountain.</p><p>He earned a bachelor's degree in advertising at Florida State University and joined an Atlanta ad agency, Liller Neal. He jumped to McCann-Erickson in 1968 and worked on the Coca-Cola account. After about two years there, he joined Dancer Fitzgerald Sample in New York.</p><p>While at Dancer, he came up with a jingle for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars: \"Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't.\"</p><p>London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. acquired Dancer in the late 1980s and carved out Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners as a separate unit run by Mr. Freeman. In 1999, Mr. Freeman acquired that unit from Saatchi in a management buyout valued at $4.6 million. After running into problems with defecting clients and colleagues, he closed the firm in 2009. Making money \"has never been one of our strong points,\" he once told the Journal.</p><p>Mr. Freeman died of pneumonia at his home in Manhattan, said his wife, Susan Kelner Freeman. They met in 1971 when she was working as a cashier at a restaurant in Manhattan. He asked her if he could borrow a pencil. \"That was some pickup line,\" said Ms. Freeman.</p><p>Mr. Freeman is also survived by a son from a previous marriage, a sister and a brother.</p><p>His commercials often featured amateur actors and sometimes included animals. During one advertising shoot in a desert, he recalled, a pig collapsed from the heat. \"We had to use a stand-in pig who wasn't as cute,\" he said, \"but you know, that's life. You just go on.\"</p><p>The appeal of the \"Where's the beef?\" ads, he said, came from the surprise of hearing a small, older woman bellow that line. In a 1998 interview, he attributed the ad to a \"big stroke of luck…a lot of things coming together.\" He expected the biggest laugh to come from a line about a big, fluffy bun, Mr. Freeman told the Chicago Tribune in 1984. Instead, a surprisingly gruff delivery by Clara Peller of another line—\"Where's the beef?\"—made the ad indelible.</p><p>Tear-jerking ads were overrated, Mr. Freeman said. \"It's easy to sell sentiment to clients and go for the heartstrings, but you put it on film, it looks the same as everything you've seen before,\" he said. \"How many naked men hugging babies can you watch?\"</p><p>Write to James R.
