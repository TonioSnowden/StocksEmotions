  "title": "How Pusha T Finally Hit No. 1 Without Changing His Tune; The hip-hop star has spent two decades rapping about one thing: selling cocaine. Now that consistency is propelling him to new critical and commercial success",
  "text": "<p>As Pusha T sees it, he's something like hip-hop's Martin Scorsese. But where Mr. Scorsese is famous for making gangster films, Pusha T has dedicated his career to rapping about selling cocaine.</p><p>\"Bro, this is art—this is how I paint,\" he said recently during an interview in a Manhattan sushi restaurant, a day after performing \"Diet Coke\" and other coke-rap hits at a hip-hop festival. \"I want to use these colors—this subject matter,\" the Virginia rapper said. \"I don't know why it's so hard to understand.\"</p><p>Plenty of hip-hop acts make songs out of their drug-trade memories. But Pusha T's unusually granular lyrics—yes, it's mostly cocaine he raps about—vivid imagery and quotable lines build a fantasy universe, critics say. His music is driven by crisply enunciated lyrics, a precise vocal delivery and stark, haunting instrumentals. Pusha T can be wickedly funny, too; on a song from the No. 1 album, he calls himself \"cocaine's Dr. Seuss.\"</p><p>Pusha T's career-long devotion to street rap is propelling him to new critical and commercial heights, making his slow-burning career one of hip-hop's most surprising success stories. His strides also show how older rappers are increasingly staying relevant as the hip-hop genre matures.</p><p>Despite first making waves in the early 2000s, Pusha T's latest album, \"It's Almost Dry,\" was his first to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The 12-song album, which arrived in a vinyl edition on Friday, is produced by a tag-team of Pharrell Williams and Kanye West. It is one of the year's most critically acclaimed rap records.</p><p>Now, there's new music in the pipeline to help the rapper ride the wave. He's working on a new solo album, once again featuring Messrs. Williams and West, among others. The music industry is also abuzz about the likelihood of a new album from Clipse, the hip-hop duo he started his career with, which has been on hiatus since 2010.</p><p>Pusha T's reliability as a rapper is a bright spot in what's been a lukewarm year for mainstream hip-hop. \"His whole thing is about consistency,\" said Mr. Williams, who, along with Neptunes partner Chad Hugo, produced much of Clipse's music. Mr. Williams has known Pusha T since their high-school days in Virginia Beach, Va., when Pusha T was known as Terrence Thornton.</p><p>\"I'm competing with the times,\" Pusha T said, referring obliquely to today's era of high-frequency releases and disposable rap. \"The fundamentals of rap—the similes, the parallels, the metaphors—I don't think that goes out of style,\" he said. \"And I think I'm proving it.\"</p><p>The story of Pusha T's rise starts in Virginia Beach, which was a buzzy area for East Coast hip-hop artists in the early to mid-1990s. \"It was hot, as a beach town, and hot, specifically, as a drug come-through—like, a drug hub—via New York,\" Pusha T said. \"You wake up and there are actually Ferraris driving down Virginia Beach Boulevard.\" His parents met as U.S. postal workers in the Bronx, but felt Virginia would offer a better life, Pusha T said. (Both died over the past year.)</p><p>Pusha T's obsession with what critics call coke-rap (and what he calls street rap) is about roots. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw an epidemic of crack cocaine in the U.S. \"Street hip-hop is the origin of hip-hop,\" Pusha T said. \"Hip-hop was based on talking about what's going on outside. You know, despair. The good, the bad and the ugly.\"</p><p>A big moment was when music producer Teddy Riley migrated down to Virginia Beach from Harlem, opening a recording studio next to a high school with a pupil named Pharrell Williams. When Pusha T was eight, he tagged along with his older brother, Malice, who had a rap group in junior high whose DJ was Timmy Tim—later known as the producer Timbaland.</p><p>Eventually, Mr. Williams, his friend Chad Hugo and Malice started experimenting with music. Pusha T later joined in, contributing a rap to a Neptunes-produced song called \"A Thief in the Night.\"</p><p>\"When we did the record, Pharrell came up with this grand idea that two brothers should be a group,\" Pusha T said. Pusha T joined forces with Malice, calling their group Clipse, for eclipse.</p><p>Aided in their careers by Mr. Williams, Clipse released two of the 2000s' most celebrated hip-hop albums: 2002's \"Lord Willin',\" which has sold over a million copies as a full package in the U.S., according to Luminate, with the single \"Grindin',\" and 2006's \"Hell Hath No Fury,\" a rap connoisseur's favorite.</p><p>But they had repeated troubles with record labels. In 2010, their former manager went to jail for running a Virginia Beach drug ring. Some of Clipse's friends were indicted, too, Pusha T said. Meanwhile, Malice grew tired of dealing with the music industry and encouraged Pusha T to go it alone. (Malice changed his name to No Malice.)</p><p>Helping guide Pusha T was manager Steven Victor, who started working with Clipse in the mid-2000s as a publicist. While considering possible labels, Pusha T received a call from rapper Rick Ross on behalf of Kanye West. Mr. West wanted Pusha T to come to Hawaii to contribute material for what would become 2010's highly regarded \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\"</p><p>Initial sessions were frustrating for Pusha T, whose organized nature fit more easily with Mr. Williams's working methods than Mr. West's. Messrs. Williams's and West's styles are \"completely night and day,\" Mr. Victor said. He and Pusha T ended up flying to Hawaii many times. At one point, Pusha T didn't want to return, they said. But he did—yielding productive sessions with Mr. West that resulted in major songs like \"Runaway,\" one of the album's biggest singles.</p><p>\"It felt like competition then—but it was just everybody learning from each other,\" Pusha T said. \"It helped me step my game up.\"</p><p>He signed with Mr. West's label, G.O.O.D. Music. After putting out his first few solo projects, he took a leadership role as president of the label in 2015 at Mr. West's request. Mr. Victor became chief operating officer. While no longer in these roles, Pusha T and Mr. Victor said they appreciated the famously unpredictable Mr. West's penchant for making business considerations—say, how much a sample is going to cost—secondary to creative ones. \"It makes music so fun,\" Pusha T said.</p><p>It took time for Pusha T to find his footing as a solo artist. His 2013 album \"My Name Is My Name,\" which featured appearances by Future and Kendrick Lamar, won praise from critics but has sold fewer than 200,000 traditional U.S. copies to date (excluding streaming). In 2018, \"Daytona\"—one of five seven-song albums that Kanye West produced that year—boosted Pusha T's profile, becoming one of the most admired albums of the year.</p><p>This year's spare, foreboding \"It's Almost Dry,\" where Mr. Williams and Mr. West produce different tracks, represents a new career high for the rapper.</p><p>Pusha T began work with Mr. Williams in Miami, then flew to L.A. to meet with Mr. West. Then back to Miami. \"It was cross-country Ping-Pong,\" Pusha T said. The two-producer approach generated a healthy competition between all three artists, encouraging Pusha T to step up his game again.</p><p>On the album's lead single, \"Diet Coke,\" Pusha T raps lines such as \"the crack era was such a Black era\" and \"You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?\" The song borrows its title from a line on Clipse's \"Hell Hath No Fury,\" effectively bringing Pusha T's career full circle. \"'Hell Hath No Fury' is Kanye's favorite album,\" Pusha T said. \"Like, period. Period.\"</p><p>Today, Pusha T owns the master-recording copyrights for his solo albums and has a joint-venture deal with Def Jam. There are also lucrative deals with companies such as Adidas and Arby's.</p><p>The rapper says he has benefited from knowing when to take direction—when to let himself be guided by a trusted producer—and when to stick to his guns with his cocaine-dealer raps.</p><p>\"He's treating it like art,\" Mr. Victor said. \"Like, 'I'm not going to let anyone or anything interfere with my process—speed me up, slow me down, move me left, move me right. I'm going to stick to what I do best, and what comes natural, and what is pure to me.'\"</p><p>How Pusha T Finally Hit No. 1 Without Changing His Tune</p>",
