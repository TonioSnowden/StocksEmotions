  "title": "U.S. News -- The Numbers: Judging the Return on 2021 Super Bowl Ads",
  "text": "<p>\"An uncomfortable aspect in marketing is that calculating the true return on investment is always elusive,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University who with his colleague Tim Calkins has run the Kellogg Super Bowl Ad Review for 17 years.</p><p>But, Dr. Rucker said, there's evidence that Super Bowl ads do generate business.</p><p>After a commercial for the startup Death Wish Coffee aired during the National Football League's title game in 2016, sales boomed, leading the company to move into a space that was nearly triple the size of its existing facility to keep up with demand.</p><p>Around the same time, researchers at Stanford University and Humboldt University in Berlin published a study of three established brands, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and found that Super Bowl ads increased revenue by 10% to 15% per household in the following eight weeks -- unless a competitor advertised during the same game. Then the gains turn to losses.</p><p>The Kellogg Review's top pick among this year's ads was a commercial for Cheetos.</p><p>In the 60-second spot, actress Mila Kunis leaves a trail of orange fingerprints as she sneaks Cheetos behind the back of her real-life husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, in a parody of the music video for the reggae hit \"It Wasn't Me.\"</p><p>\"Everyone gets the Cheetos fingers,\" Dr. Rucker said. \"They turned a potential negative -- dirty fingers -- into a positive.\"</p><p>The commercials were judged in real time by about 65 marketing students who awarded letter grades to the brands based on how effective they were at engaging the audience, delivering a unique message, showing the product's benefit and leaving a memorable and favorable impression of the brand that was consistent with its reputation.</p><p>This year, nine commercials earned A's, including ads for Amazon Alexa featuring actor Michael B. Jordan as the sexy personification of the virtual assistant and for Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade showing, with levity, a series of catastrophes as lemons rain from the sky. (You know what they say about lemons.)</p><p>\"When you look at the return on investment for such a major moment, there are a lot of different ways to evaluate success,\" said Andy Goeler, vice president of marketing for Bud Light. \"For us, we had people talking about our newest innovation, Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade, for weeks.\"</p><p>Most of the other Super Bowl ads earned B's or C's in the Kellogg Review, but six limped in with D's.</p><p>A spot for Squarespace suffered because panelists couldn't tell what the product does (it's a company that builds and hosts websites), while an ad for DraftKings, a purveyor of fantasy-sports leagues and betting, was deemed forgettable.</p><p>Other outlets also rate Super Bowl ads, but in part because their methodologies differ, they don't necessarily pick the same winners. Only four of the Kellogg Review's top-rated ads made the top 10 in the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter, which allows U.S. adults to act as judges.</p><p>Both groups gave high marks to Cheetos, Alexa, Bud Light Seltzer and Doritos. But the Ad Meter's Nos. 1 and 2 choices, both for Rocket Mortgage, earned only a B in the Kellogg Review. (The review assigns only one grade to a brand, even if it's featured in multiple ads.)</p><p>There were no F's in this year's Kellogg Review, but Burger King got an F in 2019; Squarespace received F's in 2018, 2016 and 2015; and the U.S. Census Bureau got an F in 2010, to name a few.</p><p>Those advertisers received poor grades because their messages were confusing. But other commercials have failed because of disturbing content -- such as an insurance-company ad that depicted a dead child.</p><p>\"They tend to be really, really disastrous ads, and the brand has to apologize,\" Dr. Rucker said.</p><p>Among the foulest was a 1999 Super Bowl commercial for Just for Feet, in which white people in a Humvee chased down a barefoot Kenyan runner, drugged him and put sneakers on his feet. Afterward, the shoe company sued its ad agency, alleging, among other things, that its reputation had been damaged. The lawsuit was later dropped.</p><p>So, setting aside creative disasters, are Super Bowl ads worth the expense?</p><p>Based on spending, advertisers appear to think so.</p><p>\"It outweighs the NBA Finals in six games, and the World Series in seven games,\" said Gregory Aston, head of digital-media research science for Kantar Group. In 2019, advertisers spent $290 million during the National Basketball Association's championship, $191 million during Major League Baseball's World Series, and $336 million during the Super Bowl, the company estimated.</p><p>While it's possible to lose ground with an advertising fumble, with the eyes of millions focused on the NFL championship, and the promise of significant gains, brands are willing to throw deep.</p>",
