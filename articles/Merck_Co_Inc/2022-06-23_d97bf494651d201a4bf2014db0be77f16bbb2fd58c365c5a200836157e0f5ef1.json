  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Merck Deal to Test Emboldened Regulators  ----  By David Wainer",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For those in attendance at the two-day regulator workshop on strengthening antitrust enforcement in the pharmaceutical industry last week, the message couldn't have been clearer: The days when megamergers could sail through without much scrutiny are over. </p><p>\n  Then, almost as if to present a test case for antitrust officials, The Wall Street Journal reported two days later that Merck &amp; Co. was weighing the purchase of Seattle-area biotech Seagen, which is worth just over $30 billion. The report noted there may be other suitors and that pulling a deal off \"could be tricky given the heightened risk of a regulatory challenge.\" </p><p>\n  Few investors would argue that the deal lacks strategic sense. The two companies collaborate in breast cancer, and the acquisition of Seagen would help replenish Merck's pipeline as Keytruda, its $17 billion blockbuster drug, loses patent protection later this decade. </p><p>\n  Under an old Federal Trade Commission, such a deal would have been likely to pass, perhaps with a few divestitures of overlapping products. But both FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan and Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter signaled a stricter approach, and they are eager to make that abundantly clear to the healthcare industry. </p><p>\n  There are two key reasons for that. Regulators believe too much consolidation in the healthcare space has stifled innovation and led to higher drug prices. A recent study from Brigham and Women's Hospital shows the median price of a new drug soared to about $180,000 in 2021 from around $2,000 in 2008, bringing annual spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. to more than $500 billion. </p><p>\n  \"When mergers diminish competition in pharmaceutical markets, the result is higher prices, which can have a devastating effect for patients,\" FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said at the event last week, which was organized by the FTC and the Justice Department. </p><p>\n  A possible Merck-Seagen tie-up would offer an interesting dilemma for regulators. Merck has a large presence in the oncology space, but it isn't a big player when it comes to antibody drug conjugates, the emerging class of medicines that deliver potent chemotherapy agents to kill cancer cells. Seagen is a pioneer in that space, where it has three approved drugs and total revenue approaching $2 billion. That could make the two companies complementary to each other. </p><p>\n  Yet the deal would increase Merck's \"prowess in the category and, in so doing, almost force\" providers to use its drugs to treat their cancer patients, wrote Jared Holz, a healthcare strategist at Oppenheimer. </p><p>\n  Zhiqiang Shu, a Berenberg biotech analyst who sat through the antitrust sessions, thinks a deal may not materialize. Mr. Shu points to Seagen's bladder drug Padcev, which is expected to bring in over $400 million in sales this year, as a drug the FTC could scrutinize. </p><p>\n  Seagen is studying the combination of Padcev with Merck's Keytruda for treating bladder cancer. The acquisition would allow Merck to have two drugs under the same roof, substantially increasing its bargaining power. Mr. Shu predicted instead that the two companies would expand their continuing collaboration. </p><p>\n  The Seagen board might decide to try its luck anyway. Since Chief Executive and co-founder Clay Siegall resigned last month after being arrested and charged with domestic abuse, a void at the top could be putting pressure on the board to sell, said David Maris, managing partner at Phalanx Investment Partners. </p><p>\n  That would mean the FTC might have to put its ideas into practice sooner than regulators might have expected. </p><p></p>",
