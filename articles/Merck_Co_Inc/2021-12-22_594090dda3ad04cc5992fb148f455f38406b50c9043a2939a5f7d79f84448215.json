  "title": "Gilead's Remdesivir Covid-19 Therapy Cuts Risk of Hospitalization in Study; Gilead to ask U.S. health regulators to expand the drug's use to keep people out of the hospital",
  "text": "<p>In a study of 562 patients, there were 0.7% hospitalizations for Covid-19 among subjects who received remdesivir, compared with 5.3% among patients who received placebos. There were no deaths in either group.</p><p>The results, published in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed and expanded on high-level results from the study that Gilead disclosed in a press release in September.</p><p>Gilead's remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a commonly used drug to treat people who are already hospitalized with Covid-19, but it isn't currently approved for people with less-severe cases who are recovering at home.</p><p>Gilead said in October that it had asked the Food and Drug Administration to expand the drug's approval to nonhospitalized patients, based on the results of the study in recently diagnosed patients.</p><p>\"In the campaign toward ending the Covid-19 pandemic, these data add yet another option to the armamentarium for the treatment of vulnerable patients who are at high risk for progression to severe Covid-19,\" the study authors, including several Gilead employees, wrote in the paper.</p><p>If remdesivir is cleared for recently diagnosed patients, it is unclear how widely it would be used, given its limitations compared with other treatments.</p><p>Remdesivir requires intravenous infusion given by a healthcare professional over the course of three days. On Wednesday, the FDA authorized a pill made by Pfizer Inc. that is more convenient, because it can be taken at home.</p><p>A separate antiviral pill from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP is expected to receive authorization soon.</p><p>\"The primary challenge for implementing outpatient remdesivir treatment is the pragmatic difficulty of administering a 3-day course of an intravenous agent,\" wrote Emily Heil and Shyam Kottilil, infectious-disease specialists at the University of Maryland, in an editorial published simultaneously in the New England Journal. \"Agents that could be administered orally would be vastly easier to implement in the outpatient setting.\"</p><p>Still, remdesivir could be of utility now amid a surge in cases of the Omicron variant.</p><p>The FDA warned people taking certain cholesterol and other drugs not to take Pfizer's pill because of the risk of side effects, and health experts have raised safety concerns about the Merck-Ridgeback drug.</p><p>Antibody drugs from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which are cleared for use to reduce the risk of severe disease, are thought tolose effectiveness against the Omicron variant. A third antibody drug made by Vir Biotechnology Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC is expected to work against the variant, but is in relatively short supply.</p><p>Gilead launched its study of remdesivir in people not yet hospitalized in September 2020. In April this year, the company said it had stopped the study early because of challenges enrolling patients amid the introduction of vaccines and other treatments.</p><p>The study had enrolled fewer than half the intended number of subjects when Gilead halted the study.</p><p>\"We no longer believe that developing a multiple day IV infusion treatment that requires administration in a healthcare setting addresses an unmet need for nonhospitalized patients,\" the company said in April when it announced the study cancellation.</p><p>Yet Gilead continued to follow the patients who had enrolled in the study, and in September announced that the drug was shown to be effective.</p><p>Remdesivir became an unexpected blockbuster for Gilead in the early months of the pandemic, when it was the first drug shown to speed the recovery of people hospitalized by Covid-19. The FDA first authorized it for emergency use in May 2020, and the drug received full approval in October 2020.</p><p>In October, Gilead said it projected remdesivir sales this year to be between $4.5 billion and $4.8 billion, compared with its earlier expectation of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion amid the continued surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations in the third quarter.</p><p>Gilead's Remdesivir Covid-19 Therapy Cuts Risk of Hospitalization in Study</p>",
