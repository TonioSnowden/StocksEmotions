  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX added almost 58 points, or nearly 1.5%, to 4,048</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose almost 250 points, or 0.7%, to 34,254, after rising 707 points at its session high.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP climbed 226 points, or 2%, to 11,370</p><p>On Monday, the Dow rose 529 points, or 1.6%, the S&amp;P 500 SPX jumped 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is up 8% from its 2022 low hit in mid-October, but remains down more than 27% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>It's all about the November inflation data from the consumer price index — and what that means for the Federal Reserve's ongoing battle for price stability.</p><p>The year-over-year CPI for November was 7.1%. That's less than the forecast by economists expecting to see a decline to 7.3%. The 7.1% print is down from 7.7% last month. The closely-watched \"core\" CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, came in at 6% year over year. That's lower than expectations and also lower than October's 6.3% annualized increase.</p><p>The Fed will deliver its latest interest rate increase on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to raise rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. That would follow four jumbo-sized 75 basis point hikes.</p><p>The emerging question has been how big — or how small — the Fed goes from here on rate hikes. A 50 basis point move is now \"almost certain for tomorrow,\" said Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's head of iShares investment strategy, Americas. That's between the relatively cool CPI print on Tuesday and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent speechsignaling \"the time for moderating\" beginning as soon as December.</p><p>\"Since inflation continues to remain elevated and recession risks are becoming clearer, we expect Chair Powell to provide a hawkish press conference to reign-in equity prices and push back on the rate cuts priced in for late 2023,\" Chaudhuri said. \"Next year, we think the Fed will settle at a terminal rate of around 5% and keep policy rates higher for longer.\"</p><p>As of Tuesday morning, there was more than a 50-50 chance of a quarter basis point increase in February on the federal funds rate, in the eyes offed funds futures traders.</p><p>A February quarter basis point increase is \"wishful thinking,\" according to Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. He's expecting 50 basis-point increases on Wednesday, then February and then the chance of 25 basis points in the March meeting.</p><p>\"The data was good, but not good enough to inspire the Fed to back off.…I think anybody banking on 25 [basis points] in February is seeing something that is not there.\"</p><p>As of overly optimistic views, Pavlik said the intraday retreat on gains reflected \"a little bit of rationality returning to the market\" after Tuesday's opening bell.</p><p>Intraday market moves are common on CPI days. Throughout the year, trading on days of consumer price index data has been volatile.</p><p>\"We don't get many days as important as the next two, and the U.S. CPI today and the FOMC [Fed] tomorrow are likely to be the difference between a big Santa Claus rally and a visit from Scrooge ahead of Christmas,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a note ahead of the November CPI numbers.</p><p>\"Bear in mind the S&amp;P 500's best and worst day of the year so far have both come on a CPI day, and it was only last month that the downside surprise triggered a seismic market reaction, leading to the biggest one-day gain for the S&amp;P 500 (+5.54%) since April 2020, and the largest daily decline in the 2-year Treasury yield (-24.7bps) since 2008,\" Reid added.</p><p>\"Santa is coming after all,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said in written comments. \"Given the better-than-expected inflation data this morning, with the year-over-year number coming in lower than expected and the month-over-month number slowing considerably, markets have a green light to rally into year-end.\"</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK and Moderna Inc. MRNA said Tuesday that their experimental mRNA-based cancer vaccine reduced the risk of recurrence or death when used with Merck's Keytruda in patients with late-stage melanoma. Moderna shares surged 23%, while Merck shares rose 1.1%.</p><p>* Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY released its 2023 guidance on Tuesday, highlighting potential launches on treatments including one for obesity. The pharmaceutical company is forecasting earnings per share (EPS) to range next year from $7.65 to $7.85, and adjusted EPS of $8.10 to $8.30. Next year's revenue could range from $30.3 billion to $30.8 billion, the company said. FactSet consensus called for an EPS of $9.16 and revenue of $30.2 billion. Shares are down less than 1% in trading Tuesday.</p><p>Stocks trim gains as investors gauge cool inflation report, next Fed move</p>",
