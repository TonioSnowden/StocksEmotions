  "title": "Paxlovid Becomes Household Name for Covid-19 Patients; Pfizer's antiviral pill edging out Merck's as top at-home treatment",
  "text": "<p>Both pills were cleared for use in high-risk individuals early in the course of their disease in December by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to keep people from becoming hospitalized.</p><p>While separate clinical trials showed Pfizer's drug to be 88% effective at preventing hospitalization compared with 30% by the Merck-Ridgeback drug, supply of Paxlovid was scarce at the beginning.</p><p>But supply and availability of Paxlovid have since increased, as Pfizer ramped up manufacturing.</p><p>The Biden administration also launched and expanded a test-to-treat program in which patients who test positive at retail pharmacies immediately receive their antiviral prescription. On Thursday, the administration said it would send clinical personnel to help turn several of Minnesota's state-run testing sites into locations that would also provide Paxlovid and molnupiravir, which is marketed as Lagevrio.</p><p>The increase in supply and availability has accelerated use of Paxlovid, doctors and pharmacists say, as has its recommendation by health authorities ahead of other treatments. Physicians also say they are getting more comfortable prescribing Paxlovid, which could interact dangerously with some common medications.</p><p>\"Now that Paxlovid has become much easier to obtain, by and large relative to where it was before, Paxlovid is mine and the majority of my colleagues' first choice,\" said Ali Khan, chief medical officer of value-based strategy at Oak Street Health Inc., which has more than 140 primary-care clinics in 20 states across the U.S.</p><p>Prescriptions for the antivirals ran about even until March, in part because the limited number of Paxlovid pills resulted in doctors relying on Lagevrio. Additionally, some patients couldn't take Paxlovid due to the potential harm from mixing it with other medicines they take.</p><p>Since then Paxlovid has been prescribed almost 10 times more often, and the lead is widening weekly. During the week that ended April 29, prescribers wrote 6,812 scripts of Lagevrio, compared with 76,846 of Paxlovid, according to Iqvia. The following week, prescribers wrote 8,977 scripts of Lagevrio and 118,123 scripts of Paxlovid.</p><p>Lagevrio's smaller number of prescriptions isn't surprising because the U.S. Covid-19 treatment guidelines recommend Paxlovid ahead of Lagevrio, said Eliav Barr, Merck's chief medical officer. He also said Merck is prohibited from doing typical marketing because the drug is only cleared for use under emergency authorization and not fully approved, which means providing medical information to doctors about the drug only when it is requested.</p><p>\"Our enemy isn't Paxlovid, it's Covid,\" he said, noting that the drug is used often in other countries, such as Japan.</p><p>Pfizer is pleased with the progress of Paxlovid, and it expects demand to increase because of provider and patient awareness, a Pfizer spokesman said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What has been your experience with taking Paxlovid pills? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Because of the potentially harmful interactions Paxlovid could have with other drugs, Lagevrio has \"advantages, but you've got to look at efficacy first,\" said Jason Gallagher, an infectious-diseases clinical specialist at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. \"The efficacy in the Paxlovid study was high and the efficacy in the molnupiravir study was, sadly, underwhelming.\"</p><p>Guidelines from public-health officials and infectious-disease specialists recommend Paxlovid ahead of other treatments.</p><p>\"The recommendations are strong enough that I think they do affect people's prescribing, and so they did use Paxlovid much more readily,\" said Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine in the infectious-diseases division at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p><p>Paxlovid's rollout was marked by limited supply and confusion by patients and doctors who had trouble understanding the prescribing rules and finding supplies.</p><p>But now physicians have had time to prescribe antiviral pills, and with medications that could be harmful if taken with Paxlovid.</p><p>\"Doctors have become more comfortable with Paxlovid and more regularly prescribing the more effective drug,\" said Zenobia Brown, medical director of health solutions at Northwell Health, a major New York healthcare provider.</p><p>Paxlovid, like Lagevrio, has been shown through lab studies to remain effective against Omicron and its subvariants. That has allowed doctors to prescribe it and reserve antibody treatments for other people who can't take Paxlovid because of the potentially harmful drug interactions.</p><p>Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
