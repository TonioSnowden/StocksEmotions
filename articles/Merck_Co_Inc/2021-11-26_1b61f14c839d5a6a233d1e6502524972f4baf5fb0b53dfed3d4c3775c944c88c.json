  "title": "U.S. Economy Could Enjoy Post-Holiday Glow; Rising Covid-19 cases are a hurdle, but easier hiring conditions and fewer supply-chain snarls could lessen the economy's typical January swoon",
  "text": "<p>Even in normal times, the shift in the economy from December to January is abrupt. Consumer spending drops, highway and airline traffic thins and hundreds of thousands of workers brought on temporarily for the holidays leave their jobs. If it wasn't for the adjustments that government statistical agencies make for seasonal swings, gross domestic product would register a contraction in the first quarter from the fourth quarter every single year.</p><p>But the pandemic, and all the economic imbalances it has fomented, make getting a read on what January might look like particularly hard. Covid-19 cases are, unfortunately, rising, and there is a danger that this year's holiday gatherings and travel will only exacerbate the increase. That could dent sales—an analysis by economists at JPMorgan Chase finds that spending has softened in states where Covid-19 cases have risen the most in recent weeks, relative to other places. Moreover, while it seems likely that even after the holidays, most Americans will have ample savings relative to before the pandemic, that may not be as true for people lower down the income ladder, leading to some curtailment of spending.</p><p>That said, predicting where Covid-19 cases might be headed is something of a fraught exercise. Already 37 million people have gotten their boosters, and more children are now getting vaccinated: The virus's opportunities for transmission could decline. Moreover, with Covid-19 generally not nearly as dangerous for vaccinated people as for the unvaccinated, and with new antiviral drugs from Pfizer and Merck looking as if they could become available soon, many consumers may view Covid-19 as less risky than in the past.</p><p>Meanwhile, companies ought to experience some easing of the labor and supply chain strains they have been facing. A lot of people coming off holiday jobs will be looking for work again and available to hire. And with holiday goods no longer clogging up transportation networks, getting supplies will be easier. Many businesses might look at it as a good time to secure necessary labor and rebuild depleted inventories. As a result, some of the seasonal swoons in activity that typically occur when the calendar flips might be diminished—translating into gains after they go through the seasonal-adjustment process.</p><p>This holiday season is looking a lot different from last year's. This January will look a lot different, too.</p><p>Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Economy Could Enjoy Post-Holiday Glow</p>",
