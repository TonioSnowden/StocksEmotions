  "title": "Biden Administration Looks to Expand Access to Covid-19 Antiviral Pills; Officials are reviewing whether Paxlovid, Pfizer's oral drug awaiting approval, can be made widely available on the commercial market",
  "text": "<p>Beyond that, the administration is reviewing whether Paxlovid, the antiviral from Pfizer, can be available on the commercial market in retail pharmacies if it gets regulatory clearance, the person said. Supply of the antivirals should become more plentiful by April or May.</p><p>The federal government could make the antivirals available in the commercial market via regulatory action. It would likely take congressional action for the medications to be covered by Medicare and Medicaid because emergency use authorization may not provide for reimbursement. Such authorization allows for products to be distributed during public-health emergencies based on the best available evidence at the time.</p><p>Pfizer this week asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clear the antiviral for use. A decision could come before the end of the year.</p><p>Should regulators clear Paxlovid, Pfizer would begin delivery of the drug this year, according to the company and President Biden.</p><p>The availability on the commercial market, which typically happens for products after they receive full FDA approval, could also be expanded to include molnupiravir, an oral pill from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP that is also under review by the FDA, the person said. An outside panel of experts to the FDA is scheduled to review molnupiravir's application this month.</p><p>The government plans to allocate antiviral drugs to states through a similar system to how it began with doses of Covid-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, although it will be shipped via wholesalers and not the drugmakers themselves, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Currently, if the drug receives clearance under an emergency use, distribution would be directed by the U.S. government and supply would be limited to the 10 million courses procured by the U.S. Under the proposed changes, Pfizer and Merck would be allowed to sell and distribute their pills the way they normally do with other medicines once supply increases.</p><p>No decision has been made and the goal is to ensure equitable distribution and access, the person said.</p><p>FDA clearance of an oral pill would be a turning point in the treatment of Covid-19 because people can take the therapies at home shortly after they develop symptoms and can avoid becoming hospitalized. Authorized treatments such as antibody therapies are primarily given to people in hospitals and physicians' offices.</p><p>The oral antivirals are likely to be prescribed by some pharmacists, after special federal legislation expanded their authority. In many states, there are typically limitations to whether pharmacists can prescribe medications.</p><p>Paxlovid was found by researchers in a late-stage trial to be safe and cut the risk of hospitalization or death in high-risk people with mild to moderate Covid-19 by about 89% if they took the pill within three days of diagnosis, according to Pfizer.</p><p>Under the terms of the Pfizer deal announced Thursday, the government will pay about $529 for each course of treatment, consisting of 30 pills over five days. Twice a day, patients would take two pills of Paxlovid and one pill of another antiviral called ritonavir.</p><p>The Paxlovid price is below the approximate $700 per course of treatment the U.S. agreed to pay for the Merck-Ridgeback drug. The U.S. has agreed to purchase 3.1 million courses of molnupiravir for about $2.2 billion.</p><p>The administration plans to provide antivirals for free with the courses it has already agreed to purchase, and supply is expected to be tight until spring, the person said. Commercial sales would likely occur as supply increases, the person said, and the administration is pushing drugmakers to increase manufacturing.</p><p>Congress passed legislation last year that ensured Covid-19 tests approved under emergency use authorizations were covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance without any cost-sharing requirements. Separate legislation and regulation requires Medicare to cover Covid-19 vaccines without cost-sharing.</p><p>Pfizer says it can produce at least 50 million courses of treatment next year, with more than 21 million courses in the first six months. Merck has targeted to manufacture 10 million courses of treatment by the end of the year and plans to at least double that next year. The administration is pushing Merck and Pfizer to produce more than they have publicly shared, a person familiar with the planning said.</p><p>Covid-19 Pills</p><p>More coverage of new treatment options, selected by WSJ editors.</p><p>* U.S. Buys 10 Million Treatment Courses of Pfizer's Covid-19 Pill for $5.29 Billion (Nov. 18)</p><p>* Pfizer Submits Covid-19 Pill for FDA Authorization (Nov. 16)</p><p>* Pfizer Says Covid-19 Pill Is 89% Effective in Preliminary Assessment (Nov. 5)</p><p>* Merck Asks FDA to Authorize Promising Covid-19 Pill (Oct. 11)</p><p>* Merck Pill Intended to Treat Covid-19 Succeeds in Key Study (Oct. 1)</p><p>Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Jared S.
