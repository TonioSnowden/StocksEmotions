  "text": "<p>Stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks from concerns that the Federal Reserve will cause a recession as it tightens monetary policy to combat inflation. But worse-than-expected economic figures propelled a modest recovery in markets, investors said, in a twist where bad news was actually good news. The U.S. composite purchasing managers index, which measures activity in manufacturing and services, fell to a five-month low on Thursday.</p><p>\"It's clear that economic activity is cooling, which should cool down inflation. That together is rather positive,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"We might be at a shifting point in terms of economic momentum.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is up 3.3% for the week so far, but it is still in a bear market. It closed down nearly 21% on Thursday from its last peak.</p><p>Rate-hike expectations edged down as investors priced in a higher probability of softer Fed moves in the months ahead. Markets now expect a rate cut in the second half of next year.</p><p>\"Growth is coming down, maybe even sooner than expected. That should allow the Fed to soften at some point,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 3.108% from 3.068% on Thursday, reversing direction after a two-day drop. Prices fall when yields rise</p><p>New-home sales figures for May are due at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect a decline, amid other signs of a slowing housing market as interest rates rise.</p><p>In premarket trading, software firm Zendesk surged 50% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it is close to a deal with a group of buyout firms.</p><p>FedEx rose 3.2% after reporting a rise in revenue driven by higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges. Biotech firm Seagen added 3.5% as talks with Merck for a potential acquisition pushed ahead.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with global benchmark Brent crude rising 1.2% to $107.75 a barrel. It has fallen nearly 5% this week so far, extending last week's 7% fall.</p><p>The recent decline in commodity prices is considered an encouraging signal, Ms. Dwek said. \"That's exactly what the Fed would want to see, since commodities are part of the reason why inflation is so high.\"</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.7%. Online retailer Zalando tumbled 10% after issuing a profit warning, citing weak consumer sentiment. British defense equipment provider Ultra Electronics jumped 13% after it said its takeover deal with Advent International's Copham Group moved a step closer to government approval.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks ended the week with gains. The Shanghai Composite Index on Friday rose 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 2.1%.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies were steady, with bitcoin climbing above $21,000. It had fallen below $18,000 last weekend and posted a moderate recovery this week, climbing three out of the past five days.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise as Rate-Hike Expectations Cool</p>",
