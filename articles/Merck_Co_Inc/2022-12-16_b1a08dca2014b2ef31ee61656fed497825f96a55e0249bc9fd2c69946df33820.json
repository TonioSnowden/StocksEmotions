  "title": "Coinbase, Moderna, Tesla: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Moderna Inc.</p><p>A new Moderna trial gave its stock a shot in the arm. A customized Moderna vaccine helped ward off the recurrence of melanoma in a mid-stage trial, marking an important step in the biotech's ascent. In the 150-volunteer study, the combination of Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine and Merck &amp; Co.'s Keytruda cancer immunotherapy reduced patients' risk of relapse or death by about 44%, versus Keytruda alone, the companies said Tuesday. Moderna has been eyeing new uses for its mRNA technology since it was validated with the company's Covid-19 vaccine, and if the combination proves successful in further testing, the results could broaden its applications. Moderna shares surged 20% Tuesday.</p><p>Delta Air Lines Inc.</p><p>Delta sees clear skies ahead. The U.S. carrier Wednesday lifted its outlook for the fourth quarter on strong demand for air travel, easing budding concerns about a travel slowdown. Delta's updated outlook came a day after JetBlue Airways Corp. warned that demand this month appears to be pacing below expectations. JetBlue's update raised worries that the travel boom from earlier this year was beginning to fade ahead of a possible recession. After losing billions of dollars during the pandemic, airlines are turning a profit again as travelers pack planes and remain undeterred by higher fares. Delta shares gained 2.8%.</p><p>Verizon Communications Inc.</p><p>Verizon and Netflix are teaming up to woo customers. Verizon said it would give some of its customers free Netflix for a year if they subscribed to another service through its new streaming marketplace, joining a growing field of companies looking to serve as middlemen between streamers and customers. The partnership between Verizon and Netflix is the latest alliance forged by streaming companies and connectivity providers as they look to attract and retain customers. Netflix is working to stoke subscriber growth, which has flatlined over the past year. Verizon shares lost 1.1% Wednesday.</p><p>Tesla Inc.</p><p>Tesla shares are veering toward new lows. The electric-vehicle maker's chief executive, Elon Musk, sold more than $3.5 billion worth of shares over a three-day period ended Dec. 14, per a regulatory disclosure made public Wednesday. Mr. Musk has sold more than $39 billion in Tesla shares since the stock peaked in November 2021. Since then, Tesla's market capitalization has lost more than $700 billion. Mr. Musk's focus on Twitter has irritated some Tesla investors as the auto company tracks for its worst annual stock-price performance on record. Tesla shares closed down 2.6% Wednesday, the lowest level in more than two years.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.</p><p>The overhaul of Warner Bros. Discovery is getting pricier. The entertainment company said it expects to face as much as $1 billion more in restructuring charges than it had forecast less than two months ago. The announcement comes as the company continues to cut costs and cancel programming commitments following the combination of Discovery Inc. and AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia unit. Since the completion of the merger earlier this year, there have been significant layoffs, and high-profile projects and shows—including CNN's streaming platform CNN+ and a nearly completed \"Batgirl\" movie—have been killed or canceled. Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell 8.9% Thursday.</p><p>Darden Restaurants Inc.</p><p>Higher costs took a bite out of Darden. The operator of Olive Garden and other restaurants said sales rose 9.4% in its latest quarter as people continued to go out to eat, but its profit slipped 3% to $187.2 million. The reason: Total operating expenses rose 11% from a year ago amid large increases in food and beverage costs as well as restaurant labor expenses. Darden and other restaurant operators have been raising menu prices this year to offset ballooning costs. The price of dining out is up 8.5%, according to the latest data from the Labor Department. Darden shares declined 2.1% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Coinbase, Moderna, Tesla: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
