  "text": "<p>The UK's life sciences lobby has called for more state investment in antivirals, saying that the lower effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant has made the development of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30efb138-0223-4b84-a30f-79f0e018a4b8\">drugs to treat Covid-19</a> all the more urgent. </p> <p>Ruth McKernan, chair of the UK BioIndustry Association, said the government should use the same approach for antivirals as it had for vaccines, investing in development, and pandemic preparedness initiatives like the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre.</p> <p>She said it was currently a “huge challenge” to get funding to develop drugs that might only be used for a short period of time and a “market failure”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We haven't seen similar investments in the next generation of antiviral drugs. And I would like to see more government investment in that,” she told the Financial Times. “I think that would help our biotech industry and help us create products that are suitable for the UK and for export.”</p> <p>She said the Omicron variant had shown the need for “multiple different drugs to really combat and control the virus”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The UK has bought almost 5m courses of Merck's antiviral molnupiravir, which the UK regulator was the first in the world to approve, and Pfizer's Paxlovid, which has not yet received approval. The health department did not comment on McKernan's comments specifically. </p> <p>Antivirals work by stopping a virus from replicating if given early in an infection. In people at high risk of complications from Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5991288f-7e62-4de4-9d41-88285d29ee62\">Merck's drug</a> cuts the risk of hospital admission and death by 30 per cent, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/848cce54-0d47-4488-b829-5539abddcf6e\">Pfizer's</a> by 87 per cent. </p> <p>But neither drug has been studied in vaccinated populations, where the risk of severe disease is already lower. Both have drawbacks: Merck's cannot be taken by pregnant women, and Pfizer's must be taken with an HIV drug that interferes with some commonly prescribed medicines. </p> <p>“It's fantastic that the first wave of therapies come from pharma, but I think there is an opportunity for additional support for the next wave of more creative options to come through,” McKernan said, adding that the industry also needed investment in training so more people can translate research into products.</p> <p>She also warned that the success with Covid-19 vaccines should not be taken for granted, because the next virus may be “quite different”, or that the next public health crisis could be caused by antibiotic resistance. </p> <p>“We need to be protected and we need to invest to be able to protect the population and that for me has been the wake-up call of Covid,” she said.</p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in London 2021 'UK life sciences lobby calls for investment in antivirals to fight Covid' FT.com 30 December.
