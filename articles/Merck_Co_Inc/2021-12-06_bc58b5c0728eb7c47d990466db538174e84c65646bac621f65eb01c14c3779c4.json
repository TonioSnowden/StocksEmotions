  "text": "<p>SoftBank Group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7033ca79-fcf1-45c0-b6ef-2a57df29277e\">shares fell sharply today</a> as part of a broad regional sell-off in Asia that included Alibaba, the ecommerce company founded by Jack Ma, and Evergrande Real Estate Group, the world's most indebted developer.</p> <p>SoftBank's shares fell for a seventh consecutive day to touch their lowest level since June 2020 as mounting problems at its portfolio companies, including Didi Chuxing, Arm and Alibaba, revived concerns over&#xa0;the Japanese technology conglomerate's business model.</p> <p>Investors said that last week's announcement by Chinese ride-hailing company Didi that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c30cf911-51da-4b40-a969-161351de6f04\">begun the process of delisting its shares</a> from the New York Stock Exchange had been especially chilling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shares in Evergrande, which has liabilities of more than $300bn, fell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3df27fb-f54d-4680-95cf-3563bdcd2fe4\">to an 11-year low</a> after the company on Friday said there was “no guarantee” it had enough money “to continue to perform its financial obligations”. It also said it would “actively engage” with the authorities to formulate a restructuring plan and that its chair had been summoned to a meeting with regulators. </p> <p>The slide in Asian markets followed a lower close on Friday for US indices linked to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9db45e65-a89d-41de-8b45-b1ecfb83f69f\">a weaker than expected jobs report</a> that added to declines across global markets since the discovery of the Omicron variant at the end of last month.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
