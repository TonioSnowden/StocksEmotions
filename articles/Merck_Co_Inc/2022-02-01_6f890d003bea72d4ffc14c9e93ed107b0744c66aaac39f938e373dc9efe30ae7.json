  "title": "Patients Go Without Covid-19 Treatments Amid Drug Shortage; Different rules in different states create discrepancies in access to pills and treatments",
  "text": "<p>A shortage of antiviral pills and effective antibody drugs—and difficulties obtaining them—are frustrating efforts to keep Covid-19 patients out of overwhelmed hospitals. States say they are getting a fraction of what they need to meet demand for treatments that can prevent the disease from progressing to the point of hospitalization. That is a concern for some hospitals that are dealing with staffing shortages and a daily crush of sick patients, even as the wave of cases driven by the Omicron wave recedes elsewhere.</p><p>Staff at the rural clinic where physician assistant Sara Lembke works near Dallas call about two dozen pharmacies every couple of days in search of Covid-19 antiviral pills. They often come up short. On bad days the only treatment options are steroids, cough medicine and rest.</p><p>\"It really is a shot in the dark,\" she said.</p><p>The U.S. government ships pills and antibody drugs to states, which decide where to distribute them. Ad-hoc distribution by many states is leaving patients who most need treatments unable to access them, say doctors, healthcare providers and ethicists. Which patients receive treatment depends on how states and hospitals decide who is at highest risk from infection. Clinics and other healthcare providers in some parts of the country are cut off from the supply of antibody treatments because hospitals are first in line for the drugs.</p><p>Connecticut is distributing treatments to hospitals based on their positivity rate for cases. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said it decided to initially distribute antiviral drugs to pharmacies at Meijer Inc. stores because the chain has a wide geographic reach in Michigan and the state had enough supply that it could provide doses to every store. In Oregon, community-based healthcare providers were among the first to receive Covid-19 pills, with the state choosing not to make them available at pharmacies.</p><p>At Gila Regional Medical Center, a 25-bed critical-access hospital in Silver City, N.M., the closest place to obtain Covid-19 drugs is in La Cruces, a two-hour drive away, said ER physician Wissam Rhayem.</p><p>\"It's a feeling of ineptitude,\" Dr. Rhayem said. \"There are treatments, but we don't have them.\"</p><p>Antiviral-pill manufacturers are ramping up production to meet demand. Supplies of Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid are expected to increase in the spring, according to Pfizer and state officials. Merck &amp; Co., which manufactures molnupiravir with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, said it has delivered two million courses to the U.S. and will deliver the rest of the 3.1 million courses under its contract by the end of this week.</p><p>Antibody treatments from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. don't work against Omicron, limiting the supply of these type of drugs to the one produced by GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Vir Biotechnology Inc., called sotrovimab.</p><p>Virginia is filling just 52% of sotrovimab requests, said Dr. Brooke Rossheim, a state health official. Arkansas cut administration of antibody drugs from 170 sites to 80 as demand declined last fall. Now the state is supplying 22 sites, where weekly sotrovimab shipments often run out in about four days, said Dr. Atul Kothari, the state's medical director for its healthcare associated infections program.</p><p>Glaxo and Vir have said they plan to double delivery of sotrovimab dosesin the U.S. to 600,000 in the first quarter.</p><p>There may soon be some relief after U.S. health regulators allowed for nonhospitalized patients to receive the antiviral remdesivir, from Gilead Sciences Inc. Some states say they are figuring out how to incorporate the treatment, marketed as Veklury, which requires three days of infusions.</p><p>Some states operate online search tools that can help prescribers and patients find drugs, though some prescribers say they aren't useful. Michael Sharma, an emergency-medicine physician assistant with Driven Healthcare in the Dallas area, said the state's antiviral inventories aren't updated regularly, prompting him to spend hours on the phone with pharmacies who point him to other pharmacies they have heard have pills. Mr. Sharma, who sees two or three patients a shift who are eligible for the medications, said he has occasionally resorted to telling patients to find the pharmacies themselves.</p><p>\"It's almost like a game of telephone,\" he said.</p><p>Pennsylvania sent its initial supply of Covid-19 antiviral pills to pharmacies, a policy that drew criticism from doctors for failing to ensure the drugs reach those who need it most. People without access to regular medical care or ample time and money can be at a disadvantage when it comes to getting to a doctor or finding a pharmacy, said Doug White, a University of Pittsburgh doctor and ethicist.</p><p>\"The people who will get it are the people who have the means to get there quickly,\" he said. Awarding supply by lottery is one way to offset those disadvantages, Dr. White said. UPMC, the hospital system affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, used a weighted lottery to distribute remdesivir when supplies of the drug were tight earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>In designing their distribution plans, Pennsylvania health officials considered factors such as population, drive times, Covid-19 case rates and how socially vulnerable a community may be, said state Health Department spokesman Mark O'Neill. \"We wanted all patients to have access,\" he said. New sites will be added as supply increases, he said.</p><p>In many hospitals and clinics where the pills and infusions are available, healthcare providers are reserving supplies for people at highest risk of severe Covid-19. Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, said she can't give the antibody treatment sotrovimab to all her eligible patients because of limited supplies.</p><p>Lurie Children's is giving the treatment first to patients at highest risk of severe illness from Covid-19, including children with cancer, congenital lung and heart disease and transplant patients, she said.</p><p>\"You just have to find a way to give it to the sickest patients,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com, Jared S.
