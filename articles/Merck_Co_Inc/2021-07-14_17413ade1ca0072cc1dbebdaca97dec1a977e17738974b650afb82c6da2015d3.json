  "title": "Business News: Research to Make Plastic Edible Wins Prize --- Merck awards $1.2 million to scientists working on way to convert it to protein",
  "text": "<p>The 1 million euro prize, to be used to fund further research, goes to researchers deemed to have made outstanding contributions that enable innovations in health, nutrition and energy. Merck KGaA, which goes by EMD Group in the U.S., isn't affiliated with U.S. drug company Merck &amp; Co.</p><p>The improbable-sounding task of turning plastic into protein requires some innovative chemistry that the researchers say could help address the problem of plastic waste.</p><p>\"Plastic is a mixture of different chemical elements including carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,\" Dr. Lu said. \"Food is a radically different type of materials in terms of its appearance; however, from a chemical perspective, it is also composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and other elements.\"</p><p>\"At the most basic level, our research is the conversion of the chemical elements from a plastic form to a food form,\" Dr. Lu said.</p><p>While plastic itself isn't readily biodegradable because of its long polymer chains, its building blocks are, Dr. Techtmann said. The scientists use a chemical process they developed to break down the polymer chains to make a compound that is fed to bacteria. They convert the resulting building blocks into cells consisting of about 55% protein that are then harvested, dried and ground.</p><p>The first results of the project have been promising. \"I think we have proof of concepts at this point,\" Dr. Techtmann said.</p><p>The researchers are currently testing the safety of the food product they have engineered, and eventually want to ensure it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as food \"generally recognized as safe.\" They believe the end product could be similar to the protein powder sold in gyms.</p><p>\"What we have been able to produce looks a little bit like brown sugar. It's a little bit more granular than that kind of workout powder that you buy in the supermarket,\" Dr. Techtmann said.</p><p>Dr. Lu and Dr. Techtmann initially want to use the prize money from Merck to work on increasing the product's health benefits. That could involve adapting the process by using different kinds of bacteria to yield different nutritional results.</p><p>To do this, bacteria identified by Dr. Techtmann's laboratory that are able to convert plastic to protein will be combined with other macrobiotic bacteria cultivated by Dr. Lu and his team.</p><p>\"We have engineered a set of microbial consortia that break down PET, a common plastic used in water bottles, and convert them to biomass as a new food source,\" Dr. Lu said. \"In addition, we design and construct probiotics, such as lactic acid bacteria that are commonly involved in cheese and yogurt fermentation. By creating 'designer probiotics,' the quality of food would be improved by enhancing their nutrition, improving their storage time and resistance to pathogens, and even introducing tailored therapeutic effects.\"</p><p>The project started last year after a request from the Pentagon's research agency, which provided $7.2 million in funding. A representative for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency said the funding was part of a project aimed at developing a way to turn plastic waste into critical battlefield supplies such as food, lubricants and adhesives.</p><p>Although it could be years before the technology becomes widely used, the scientists hope to find partners from industry in the near future to help commercialize it and develop business ideas.</p>",
