  "text": "<p>The pitter-patter of little feet is growing quieter. Birth rates are in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc825399-345c-47b8-82e7-6473a1c9a861\">decline</a> from China to France. Lockdowns, personal choice and financial constraints all play a part. Even the burgeoning fertility industry took a dip during the pandemic. These procedures do not lend themselves to social distancing. Fertility sales fell by more than a tenth at US-listed Cooper Companies last year.</p> <p>Yet the bigger picture suggests demand for fertility help has not disappeared. Just shy of 2 per cent of babies born in the US are conceived using assisted reproductive technology such as IVF, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/art/artdata/index.html#preliminary\">according</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 330,000 such cycles were performed in 2019, the latest available data show, up 8 per cent year on year. They resulted in 84,000 babies.</p> <p>There are several reasons to expect these figures to trend higher, ranging from delayed motherhood to <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-07/thuo-css072017.php\">falling sperm counts</a>. Some countries, including the UK, help to foot the bill. Technology is also improving. In 2018, IVF patients aged between 40 and 42 had a higher chance of giving birth than those under 35 in 1991, <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/fertility-treatment-2018-trends-and-figures/\">according</a> to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.</p> <p>This makes the industry fertile ground for the likes of <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1821825/000119312521084081/d56612dex991.htm#rom56612_6\">Organon</a>, freshly spun-off from pharma giant Merck and due to start trading next month. The group, which is originally Dutch and has been around the block a few times, reaped pro forma sales of $6.5bn and adjusted ebitda of $3bn last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Profits have fallen in each of the past two years. This is ripe terrain for generics. Assuming flat ebitda this year and applying the same multiple as Viatris, a pharma group with which it has some overlap, implies an enterprise value of $19.5bn. But a premium over that is likely.</p> <p>Most players in the area have broader remits into women's health and beyond. Cooper sells IUDs and Organon garnered a fifth of last year's sales from contraceptives. Baby boom or bust, these are neatly hedged investments.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
