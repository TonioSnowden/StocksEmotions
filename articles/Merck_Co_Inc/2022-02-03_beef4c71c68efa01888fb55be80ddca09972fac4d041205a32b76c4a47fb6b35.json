  "text": "<p><em>Good morning. Today we are looking at the ongoing troop build up in eastern Europe and how Miami became the most important city in America. But first, warnings of slowing growth from Facebook and Spotify. </em></p> <p>Investors wiped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51ea47e1-50c1-4b72-94d6-884017a1af4a\">almost $200bn</a> from the market valuation of Facebook-owner Meta as the company warned that its users were spending more time on newer rivals such as Chinese-owned TikTok.</p> <p>Shares in the company plummeted more than 20 per cent in after-hours trading, putting them on course for their worst day since the social media group listed in 2012. The share price fall has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/affc87a3-3bc2-48c3-b9a7-0c7b5301ec49\">unsettled investors</a> in Asia and Asia today. </p> <p>Meta blamed “increasing competition” for the disappointing results and Apple's recent privacy changes. </p> <p>“There's a clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalised ads,” Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts after the results were released.</p> <p>The social media group is also investing heavily in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">the metaverse</a> which it hopes will fuel future growth but spending on the new project ate into fourth-quarter profits.</p> <p>Meta was not the only technology company to warn growth is slowing. Spotify, which has been embroiled in a controversy surrounding Joe Rogan, said subscriber growth would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df1437bc-ded5-491e-b320-2dcc93f8f3a9\">slow significantly</a> in the current quarter. The gloomy outlook sent shares down as much as 23 per cent in after-hours trading. Daniel Ek, Spotify chief executive, said it was “too early to know” whether the backlash over the popular podcaster would cost the streaming service subscribers.</p> <p>Shares in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41eb5628-79d3-416b-8432-b11fd1ceb905\">PayPal also tumbled</a> after the US payments group slashed its growth forecasts. It said many of the new accounts opened during the pandemic had failed to generate any meaningful&#xa0;business. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>Rogan's thoughtful response to public criticism illustrates why his show has become the platform's most popular, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f988d96-3262-4dda-8d49-89ff0a30c462\">writes Jemima Kelly</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

Washington also said it would redeploy roughly 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania.
