  "text": "<p>Scrutiny of Google is up in the land down under. Australia's competition watchdog expressed concerns about the dominance of the Alphabet unit in a large part of the online-advertising sector, and said it is considering regulatory action. The country's aggressive stance with large U.S. tech companies is being widely watched as other countries consider similar actions. Earlier this year, Australian lawmakers passed a law effectively requiring big tech firms, including Google and Facebook, to pay news publishers for content. Alphabet shares lost 3.8% Tuesday.</p><p>MERCK &amp; CO.</p><p>MRK +8.4%</p><p>The next treatment for Covid could be in the form of a pill. Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said Friday that their experimental pill helped prevent high-risk people early in the course of the virus from becoming seriously ill and dying. The drug, called molnupiravir, cut the risk of hospitalization or death in study subjects with mild to moderate Covid by about 50%. The results put molnupiravir on track to potentially be authorized by the end of the year, giving an option for doctors seeking a drug their patients can take at home to avoid hospitalization. Merck shares soared 8.4% Friday.</p><p>FACEBOOK INC.</p><p>FB -3.7%</p><p>A version of Instagram designed for children is not getting a lot of likes in Washington, D.C. The social media giant said Monday it would suspend its plans for Instagram Kids after lawmakers voiced concerns about the effect on the mental health of young people. During a Thursday hearing, Senate members accused the company of disregarding internal research showing Instagram is harmful for teen girls. Facebook shares fell 3.7% Tuesday.</p><p>DOLLAR TREE INC.</p><p>DLTR +17%</p><p>Dollar Tree is passing the buck. The discount chain, which sells nearly everything for a dollar, plans to add more products at slightly higher prices as costs rise for a range of goods. The retailer said it would start selling products at $1.25 and $1.50, or other prices slightly above $1, in some of its stores, expanding current tests of higher price points in a section labeled Dollar Tree Plus. The rising prices are a result of inflation, higher wages in the tight labor market and larger freight costs amid supply-chain snarls. Dollar Tree shares jumped 17% Wednesday.</p><p>WARBY PARKER INC.</p><p>WRBY +36%</p><p>Warby Parker had an eye-opening debut. The eyewear maker is worth roughly $6.8 billion after going public on Wednesday, finishing its first trading day with a valuation twice what it was in a private funding round last year. The company sold shares via a direct listing, rather than a traditional public offering. The reception showed investor interest in growth-focused, unprofitable direct-to-consumer retailers hasn't waned more than a year after Casper Sleep Inc.'s underwhelming debut. Warby Parker shares ended 36% above its reference price of $40 Wednesday.</p><p>BED BATH &amp; BEYOND INC.</p><p>BBBY -22%</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell behind this past quarter. The home-goods retailer on Thursday reported a quarterly-sales decline and lowered its guidance for the year, citing supply-chain challenges, inflation and slower store traffic due to Covid-19 concerns. The woes come as businesses rush to restock pandemic-depleted inventories and struggle with a clogged supply chain. Chief Executive Mark Tritton said the company is also addressing internal execution issues, such as how to best allocate its marketing resources to attract more shoppers. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares dropped 22% Thursday.</p><p>LORDSTOWN MOTORS CORP.</p><p>RIDE -18%</p><p>Lordstown is trying to avoid running on empty. The cash-strapped electric-truck maker said Thursday it plans to sell an Ohio factory it purchased two years ago as it works to bring its first pickup truck to market. The buyer is contract assembler Foxconn Technology, which would help Lordstown make vehicles and invest $50 million in Lordstown through a purchase of common stock. Lordstown has been trying to raise capital after warning earlier this year it was burning through cash faster than expected. Lordstown shares crashed 18% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
