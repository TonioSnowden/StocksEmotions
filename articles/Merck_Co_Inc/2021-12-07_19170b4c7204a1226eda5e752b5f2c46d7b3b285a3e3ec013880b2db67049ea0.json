  "title": "Pfizer Could Have Done More to Help Low-Income Countries Handle Vaccines, CEO Says; 'We should have done it better,' says Albert Bourla",
  "text": "<p>Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Albert Bourla said the drugmaker could have done more to help improve low vaccination rates in poor countries, despite efforts to try to get supply to the countries.</p><p>Pfizer has been able to send more doses to poor countries after ramping up manufacturing, he said Tuesday. Yet some countries in Africa recently asked the company to delay shipments, he said, because they can't administer all of the doses.</p><p>Mr. Bourla said Pfizer should have anticipated the infrastructure and vaccine hesitancy hurdles, and helped countries resolve them.</p><p>\"We should have done it better,\" he said Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council.</p><p>The company could have partnered earlier with nongovernment organizations to help address vaccine hesitancy. He praised a recent effort to do so by the World Health Organization, but noted \"that's something that we could have done ourselves.\"</p><p>Pfizer has a program that delivers the vaccine via drone, he said.</p><p>Vaccine makers including Pfizer have faced criticism from global-health advocates and officials at low- and middle-income countries for supplying more vaccines to wealthier nations.</p><p>Mr. Bourla said he was proud of Pfizer's efforts to ensure every country could get vaccines by pricing the doses differently depending on the wealth of the country, including selling shots at-cost to low-income nations.</p><p>The U.S. purchased 1 billion doses of vaccine at-cost to donate to developing countries, he said. Pfizer developed the vaccine with partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>Mr. Bourla touched on a range of issues during the CEO Council interview, including the proper pronunciation of Omicron, a letter in his native Greek alphabet.</p><p>He endorsed masking and vaccine mandates, expressing regret that the issues have been politicized. \"Ridiculous,\" he said about masks. \"It's about health.\" He described vaccine mandates as an effective public-health measure, and said Pfizer implemented one for its employees.</p><p>The company is studying whether its Covid-19 vaccine provides less protection against the Omicron variant, and hopes to have more information in the coming weeks, he said.</p><p>Omicron appears to be more contagious but cause less severe disease, he said, but stressed that more work needs to be done to know for sure.</p><p>\"I don't think it's good news to have something that spreads fast,\" he said. \"Spreads fast means that it will be in billions of people and another mutation may come. You don't want that.\"</p><p>Mr. Bourla said he hopes the Food and Drug Administration will authorize this month Pfizer's Covid-19 drug Paxlovid. The pill was found in a preliminary look of late-stage study results to be 89% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death.</p><p>He said the FDA has asked for results from the trial's final analysis, and he said that should be submitted later this month.</p><p>Mr. Bourla said he doesn't expect the drug's efficacy to fall in the final analysis, as happened with a Covid-19 pill from Merck &amp; Co. and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.</p><p>\"I don't expect in our case this will be the case, and we will have the data soon,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
