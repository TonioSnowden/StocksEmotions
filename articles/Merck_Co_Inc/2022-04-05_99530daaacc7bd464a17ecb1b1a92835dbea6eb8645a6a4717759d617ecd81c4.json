  "text": "<p>Sofinnova Investments makes venture-capital investments and manages a biotech hedge fund, which it launched in 2017. The firm, formerly called Sofinnova Ventures, changed its name in 2019 to reflect the addition of the hedge fund.</p><p>Several venture investments Sofinnova has made in recent years have led to initial public offerings or acquisitions, including ocular gene-therapy company Gyroscope Therapeutics, which agreed in December to be acquired by Novartis AG for up to $1.5 billion in cash and success-based payments.</p><p>Sofinnova Investments—which isn't affiliated with European venture firm Sofinnova Partners—said in October 2016 that it had closed a $650 million biotech venture fund. The firm has raised $485.7 million toward a new venture fund with a total offering amount of $600 million, according to a regulatory filing.</p><p>Sofinnova, which frequently invests in cancer drug developers, can tap into Dr. Carpenter's experience as a clinician, researcher and executive when making new investments in the field.</p><p>Dr. Carpenter, who is board certified in internal medicine and medical oncology, for 14 years led a laboratory at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center before entering the pharmaceutical industry in 2007, when he joined Merck &amp; Co.</p><p>With Merck, he led the development of a cancer medication that was licensed to biotech company Tesaro Inc., in 2012, and developed into Zejula, which treats ovarian and other cancers.</p><p>He joined GlaxoSmithKline PLC in 2011, holding positions including senior vice president and head of the cancer epigenetics group, the study of how cells control gene expression without changing DNA sequences. While at GSK he worked with Perry Nisen, a former senior executive of the drugmaker who later joined Sofinnova as an executive partner in 2018.</p><p>That connection, and the opportunity to help Sofinnova in areas such as evaluating data, interviewing outside experts and deciding where to invest, led him to join the firm, he said.</p><p>\"I enjoy digging deeply into science,\" Dr. Carpenter said.</p><p>Sofinnova's notable cancer investments include VelosBio Inc., whose lead drug was an antibody-drug combination with potential to treat blood cancers and solid tumors. Merck acquired the company in 2020 for $2.75 billion.</p><p>Sofinnova historically has focused largely on companies with drugs in clinical trials, seeking those targeting large markets with differentiated medications, but it also invests in earlier-stage biotechs when the opportunity and risk profile are compelling, according to Managing Partner Jim Healy.</p><p>In the highly competitive cancer field, for example, biotech startups often go public quickly, so venture firms have to consider investing in them in their early stages, Dr. Carpenter said.</p><p>Dr. Carpenter said he would work from a new office Sofinnova will open in Boston.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
