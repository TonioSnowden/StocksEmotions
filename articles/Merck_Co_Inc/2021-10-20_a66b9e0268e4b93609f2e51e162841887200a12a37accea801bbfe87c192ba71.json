  "text": "<p>Despite the negative news, the company said its data suggested that its AT-527 treatment has antiviral activity in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions.</p><p>The results come after Merck &amp; Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said earlier this month that their experimental Covid-19 pill cut the risk of hospitalization or death by about 50% in high-risk people with mild to moderate Covid-19. They have since filed an application asking U.S. health regulators to authorize their antiviral drug, molnupiravir.</p><p>Atea and Roche said they are considering modifying their Phase 3, or final-stage, study of the drug based on the results from the Phase 2 study. Modifications could include changes to which patients are enrolled and the study's primary goal. Results are now expected in the second half of 2022; analysts had previously been expecting data this year.</p><p>Antiviral drugs often are most effective early in the course of disease and show the most benefit in patients whose own immune systems aren't adequately fighting the virus.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
