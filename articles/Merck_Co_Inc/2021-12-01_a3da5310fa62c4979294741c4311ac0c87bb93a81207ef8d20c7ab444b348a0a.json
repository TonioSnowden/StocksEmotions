  "text": "<p>The panel's blessing paves the way for the drug, molnupiravir, to be available in the U.S. before the end of the year.</p><p>Merck plans to study whether molnupiravir is effective against the worrisome Omicron variant and is working to collect samples of the new strain to do so, Nick Kartsonis, who oversees Merck's vaccine clinical research, told the panel. \"We expect, based on what we know about the Omicron variant, that molnupiravir would be effective against this particular variant,\" he said.</p><p>Merck earlier presented data to the panel showing how molnupiravir is effective against other variants, which the company and other scientists have said is due to how the drug works differently than vaccines and antibody drugs.</p><p>Molnupiravir targets machinery the virus uses to replicate, rather than the spike protein, the structure that helps the virus infiltrate cells. Omicron has several mutations to the spike protein, which researchers say could help the variant evade vaccines and drugs trained on that part of the virus.</p><p>The companies said last week that a final analysis found the drug to be about 30% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in high-risk people, lower than the 50% efficacy first announced in October after a preliminary look at the data.</p><p>Roy Baynes, Merck's chief medical officer and head of global clinical development, said in an interview that the company's clinical trial design was done in consultation with the FDA, including the planned interim analysis, and its 50% efficacy shouldn't be discounted. \"The trial was essentially over at that point,\" he said, noting how the drug was performing so well in the study that the FDA agreed enrollment should stop.</p><p>The FDA isn't required to follow the committee's advice but normally does.</p><p>The vote followed a daylong meeting in which Merck and the FDA presented data about molnupiravir's studies in trial participants and other tests. Panel members discussed concerns over safety of the drug, the changing efficacy from the study, and which patient populations taking molnupiravir could be helped.</p><p>Several panel members who voted in favor of authorization said use of molnupiravir should be limited to unvaccinated people at high risk of Covid-19 complications, and that while more data are needed on efficacy and potential side effects, the pill would fill a major gap in the pandemic because of its convenience as an oral therapy.</p><p>\"I'm not sure that this is really the one we've been waiting for, but it's all we've got right at the moment,\" said John Coffin, a professor of molecular biology at Tufts University who said he has been hoping for an oral treatment for Covid-19 and voted in favor of authorization.</p><p>Panel members who voted against the recommendation said they were concerned with how there wasn't a clear explanation on why molnupiravir's efficacy changed, and that the drug's benefit to patients may be minimal. Some also wanted further study of molnupiravir.</p><p>If the FDA authorizes molnupiravir, Merck has agreed to provide the U.S. government with 3.1 million courses of the drug for about $2.2 billion.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
