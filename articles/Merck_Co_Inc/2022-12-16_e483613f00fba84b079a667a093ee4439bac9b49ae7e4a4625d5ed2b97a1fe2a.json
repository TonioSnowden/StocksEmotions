  "title": "BioNTech upgraded to buy on high hopes for combined flu/COVID vaccine and oncology pipeline; Oncology is 'the next leg of growth' for BioNTech, according to Bank of America analysts",
  "text": "<p>\"The oncology pipeline represents the next leg of growth for the company and we see potential for upside as these programs mature,\" the team wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Positive data this week from Moderna Inc. MRNA and Merck MRK in a trial of Merck's Keytruda and a Moderna mRNA vaccine in treating patients with late-stage melanoma are positives for BioNTech's NeST platform, which also aims to treat melanoma and other solid tumors, said the note.</p><p>See also: The big bet: Can retail pharmacy chains remake themselves into healthcare providers?</p><p>Bank of America is also upbeat on the company's FixVac platform, which uses a combination of mRNA-encoded, tumor-associated antigens that aim to trigger a strong and precise immune response against cancer. The Food and Drug Administration granted a Fast Track designation to BioNTech's BNT111 product candidate last November. BNT111 is the lead product from the FixVac program.</p><p>Bank of America's discounted cash flow-derived $239 price target includes $33 from FixVac and NeST, $150 from the COVID vaccine and about $19 from early-stage pipeline assets including intratumoral immunotherapy, RiboMabs, RiboCytokines and engineered cell therapy and antibody platforms, as well as future potential infectious disease indications, said the note.</p><p>The remaining value comes from the cash position.</p><p>BioNTech's COVID/flu vaccine \"represents an attractive opportunity to increase long-term annual booster rates given a more established flu market,\" the analysts wrote.</p><p>See also: Pfizer and BioNTech get FDA fast track designation for single-dose COVID and flu vaccine candidate</p><p>The company started a Phase 1 trial for the combination vaccine in the third quarter, with data expected in 2023.</p><p>\"Additionally, next-gen COVID vaccines could also increase uptake long-term, and we view China as a potential large opportunity for BNTX as the country slowly begins to ease COVID restrictions and has reengaged in dialogues for a potential approval,\" said the note.</p><p>China has been relying on its homegrown vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac through the pandemic, but has recently signaled a possible shift as they appear to have been less effective than the ones used widely in the West.</p><p>Overall, the analysts are expecting COVID booster rates to decline as the illness becomes endemic and they lowered their estimates for COVID revenue to EUR8 billion in 2023 from EUR17 billion in 2022.</p><p>But a flu/COVID combo would likely be more attractive as soon as it's available.</p><p>\"We view the next catalyst for BNTX shares to be 2023 revenue guidance in early 2023 and believe investors could use that overhang lift to take a fresh look at shares,\" said the note.</p><p>BioNTech shares were down about 3% in Thursday's down-market, but they have gained about 25% in the last three months, while the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF XBI has fallen 5.1% and the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 1.5%.</p><p>BioNTech upgraded to buy on high hopes for combined flu/COVID vaccine and oncology pipeline</p>",
