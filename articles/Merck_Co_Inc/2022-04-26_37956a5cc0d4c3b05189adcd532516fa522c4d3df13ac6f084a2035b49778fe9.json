  "title": "Covid Pills to Become More Widely Available; Biden administration plans to expand access to free treatments that can help Covid patients avoid hospitalization",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration on Tuesday is expected to outline plans to make it easier for infected people to get Covid-19 treatments, which some health leaders and patient advocates say are too difficult to obtain despite a federal program to help make them more widely available.</p><p>The administration has heavily touted vaccines to reduce the risk of serious illness from Covid-19. Officials also have been urging greater use of two pills given they are easy to take at home: Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid and Merck &amp; Co.'s and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP's molnupiravir, also known as Lagevrio. Both were cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December.</p><p>The authorization of those pills marked a turning point in the treatment of Covid-19 because people can take the therapies at home shortly after they develop symptoms, helping prevent hospitalization.</p><p>To expand access to the pills, the administration in coming weeks is planning to double the 20,000 pharmacies, community health centers and hospitals where the antivirals are currently available for patients. Pharmacies would also be allowed to order free antivirals from the federal government, according to a senior administration official.</p><p>The moves follow reports of frustration with the administration's so-called test-to-treat initiative to make treatments more widely accessible. The program aims to ensure people can get tested at a pharmacy and get antiviral pills immediately at the same location for no cost.</p><p>Supplies of the antivirals have improved after they were limited early on. Patient groups and some health leaders have said it is difficult for patients to obtain the antivirals because the pills aren't in stock or they aren't able to get prompt appointments with providers.</p><p>Some providers may also not be familiar with the drugs or realize there are more treatments available, so there is room for more education and outreach, a second administration official said.</p><p>The federal government agreed to buy up to 20 million courses of Paxlovid and has enough funding for the order, a third senior administration official said. The U.S. bought 3.1 million courses of the Merck-Ridgeback drug and has allocated more than 2.6 million courses to states and territories so far.</p><p>Paxlovid was found to be far more effective than Lagevrio in clinical trials, and regulators and guidelines recommended using Paxlovid if possible.</p><p>Other actions include expanding test-to-treat sites from the current 2,200 locations to additional communities. The administration will decide in the coming weeks how federally supported sites can best be expanded and scaled if needed during any potential future surge in cases, one of the officials said.</p><p>These sites will be targeted to meet demand and increase equitable access to Covid-19 treatments and will function in direct collaboration with state and local health agencies, according to the official.</p><p>Other efforts to promote the drug treatments will include outreach and education to medical providers about the drugs and a public-service campaign about the treatment options, officials said.</p><p>Merck's Lagevrio can be prescribed to adults at high risk of severe disease within five days after they develop mild to moderate Covid symptoms. Physicians can prescribe Pfizer's Paxlovid to high-risk patients age 12 and older early in the course of disease, within five days after they develop symptoms.</p><p>The administration in November began exploring ways to expand access, including whether Paxlovid can be available on the commercial market in retail pharmacies.</p><p>Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Jared S.
