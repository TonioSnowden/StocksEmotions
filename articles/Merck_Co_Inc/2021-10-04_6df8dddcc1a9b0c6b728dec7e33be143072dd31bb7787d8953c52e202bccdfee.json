  "text": "<p>Monday's moves continued a recent trend of underperformance in big technology companies. Investors have fled shares of the highflying stocks as bond yields have lurched higher. Higher yields make tech companies' outsize profits in the future less attractive.</p><p>After notching big gains since early 2020, the sector has been particularly volatile in recent sessions.

Morgan Private Bank. \"This should all eventually be manageable but this is the problem with policy uncertainty, especially about the world's two largest economies.\"</p><p>In corporate news, Tesla shares rose around 1.3% after the auto maker reported record deliveries in the third quarter.

Evergrande carries more than $300 billion of liabilities that investors think it is unlikely to pay.</p><p>In commodities market, oil prices surged as OPEC and a Russia-led group of oil produced agreed to continue increasing production in measured steps, deciding against opening the taps more widely.
