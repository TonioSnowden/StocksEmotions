  "title": "VC Daily: ShouTi Lands $100 Million to Develop Pills for Chronic Diseases",
  "text": "<p>South San Francisco-based ShouTi aims to develop pills that work as well or better than current biologics. Its approach involves studying how biologics interact with molecular targets in the body. The goal is to identify smaller molecules that interact in the same way. These smaller molecules can then be developed into pills that are easily stored, according to Dr. Stevens.</p><p>ShouTi's small-molecule drugs may also have other advantages, such as improved ability to penetrate tissues in the body, he said.</p><p>ShouTi, founded in 2017, has an early-stage pipeline that includes potential medicines for chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. These conditions were prevalent before the pandemic, but Covid-19's impact on the lungs and heart will increase the need for treatments in these areas, Dr. Stevens said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Regulatory hodgepodge. Telemedicine startups expanding nationwide are navigating increasingly complex regulatory terrain as states take varying stances on how they govern this type of healthcare.</p><p>Telemedicine companies have scaled up rapidly during the pandemic to meet growing demand. Venture capitalists fueled much of the growth, investing $13 billion in U.S. telemedicine startups this year, as of Oct. 18, compared with $7.7 billion in all of last year, according to PitchBook Data Inc.</p><p>Startups have benefited from relaxed restrictions on telemedicine enacted because of Covid-19. Now some states are reverting back to their old rules, while others are continuing their pandemic policies, creating a regulatory hodgepodge for startups to negotiate.</p><p>Medicare coverage for telemedicine, minimal before the pandemic, has expanded greatly because of the public-health emergency. Unless Congress acts, that broader coverage will diminish once the public-health emergency ends. A bipartisan bill in the Senate, and companion legislation in the House, would expand Medicare coverage of telemedicine.</p><p>$13 Billion</p><p>The amount of venture capital invested in U.S. telemedicine startups through Oct. 18 this year, according to PitchBook.</p><p>European Life Sciences Investor Sofinnova Raises $548 Million</p><p>European venture-capital firm Sofinnova Partners has raised €472 million, equivalent to $548 million, to invest in life sciences startups, the latest in a series of healthcare funds the firm has closed recently. Sofinnova raised this latest fund, to invest in early-stage biotechnology and medical-device companies. In July, Sofinnova said it had raised a €63 million pool to launch medical-technology startups, and in March, it disclosed a €445 million crossover fund targeting later-stage companies. A decade ago, capital for European startups was harder to come by, but Sofinnova has found that funding for its startups is now more readily available. European biotech startups secured $3.66 billion in venture capital in the first half of this year, approaching the $4.6 billion raised in all of 2020, according to Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>WSJ Tech Live</p><p>Sarah Guo, a partner at Greylock Partners, spoke Wednesday at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference.</p><p>Greylock's Sarah Guo Sounds Alarm on Heightened Cybersecurity Risks</p><p>23andMe Cites Broader Tech Privacy Concerns for Kit Sales Dip [Video]</p><p>Republican SEC Commissioner Criticizes Agency's Approach to Crypto</p><p>Industry News</p><p>People</p><p>Pulmonary disease treatment developer Avalyn Pharma Inc. appointed Marc Schneebaum as chief financial officer.
