  "title": "Stocks Slip to Start the Fourth Quarter; Major indexes continued their downward trend as some investors expect slower gains and persistent volatility",
  "text": "<p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.5%, continuing a bad streak for tech stocks.</p><p>Starting a new quarter does reset the board for investors, to an extent, but the calendar can do only so much. \"What's really changed?\" said Peter Cecchini, the director of research at Axonic Capital. The issues that have dogged the market recently aren't going to just evaporate. Massive stimulus spending during the pandemic kept the economy afloat, but inflation, supply-chain disruptions and Covid haven't disappeared, he said.</p><p>Although many investors expect stocks to keep rising, a bevy of factors has prompted them to anticipate slower gains and more persistent volatility. The Federal Reserve and other global central banks have tilted in recent weeks toward reining in pandemic-era stimulus measures.</p><p>The key question now and into next year, he said, is how quickly those issues dissipate. \"The tail risk from the virus is still around,\" he said.</p><p>On the economic front, U.S. consumer spending rose 0.8% in August, the Commerce Department said. The pickup signals the U.S. economic recovery is gaining steam heading into autumn.</p><p>Investors though are still contending with lingering worries over property giant China Evergrande Group and whether Congress can resolve its battles over U.S. spending plans. House Democrats delayed plans to vote on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill Thursday, as they came up short on reaching agreement around a separate social policy and climate package.</p><p>Surging prices for natural gas in Europe and Asia have raised concerns that the bout of inflation will last longer than many money managers had expected. Meantime, rising energy costs are expected to take a toll on growth in the world economy.</p><p>Energy prices cooled somewhat Friday. Futures for U.S. crude oil rose 0.1% to $75.11. Dutch natural-gas futures—which have surged almost fivefold in 2021 and are the benchmark in European gas markets—slipped 1.3% to 96.50 euros a megawatt-hour. That is equivalent to about $112 a megawatt-hour.</p><p>\"The market's focus has turned to the stagflation narrative with what's been going on in natural gas,\" said Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Mr. Morris expects the stock market to be choppy but keep posting modest gains.</p><p>In corporate news, Merck gained 8.7% after the drugmaker said an experimental Covid-19 pill helped prevent high-risk people early in the course of the disease from becoming seriously ill and dying. The stock is looking at its biggest one-day gain since August 2016.</p><p>Theater chain and meme stock favorite AMC Entertainment rose 1.6% after announcing the repurchase of debt securities that lowered its overall interest costs.</p><p>The combination of central bank tightening and rising prices has sent bond yields higher this week. On Friday, however, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.483% from 1.528% the day before. Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of currencies, slipped 0.3%, trimming recent gains that had pushed it near a one-year high. Bitcoin rose around 7.3% to about $47,043.</p><p>Overseas markets also retreated. The Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.4%, led lower by shares of banks, oil-and-gas companies and basic-resources producers.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 2.3% and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.6%. Markets in Hong Kong and mainland China were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slip to Start the Fourth Quarter</p>",
