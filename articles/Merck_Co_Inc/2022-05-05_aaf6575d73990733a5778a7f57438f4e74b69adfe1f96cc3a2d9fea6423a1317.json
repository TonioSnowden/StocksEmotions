  "title": "Business News:  Moderna's Revenue Triples on Surging Spikevax Demand  ----  By Peter Loftus and Dean Seal",
  "text": "<p>   Moderna Inc. said that its first-quarter revenue and profit tripled from a year earlier on higher sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and that a fall booster-shot campaign could drive continued sales gains. </p><p>   The biotechnology company's revenue topped $6 billion in the period ended March 31, beating analyst expectations and rising from $1.94 billion a year earlier, driven almost entirely by sales of its messenger RNA-based vaccine, branded as Spikevax. </p><p>   The year-earlier period was the first full quarter of the vaccine's availability, and there was a limited supply available initially, while more recently there has been a surplus of doses in some regions. Many are being used as booster shots. </p><p>   Moderna is the latest drugmaker to show surging sales due to demand for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, following recent reports from Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Merck &amp; Co. and Pfizer Inc. </p><p>   The Cambridge, Mass., company also reiterated its forecast of the value of signed Covid-19 vaccine supply contracts that could yield continued sales growth for full-year 2022, as the company seeks to widen use of its vaccine. </p><p>   Moderna said it has $21 billion in advance purchase agreements for full-year 2022, after posting $18.5 billion in revenue for 2021. </p><p>   The 2022 agreements don't include a new supply agreement with the U.S. government. A new federal contract -- or possible private-market purchases in the U.S. -- could boost revenue. But that could be partly offset by some purchasers recently scaling back dose orders, including the Covax program for lower- and middle-income countries, Moderna said. </p><p>   Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine is its first and only marketed product. The company has nearly 30 other drugs and vaccines in clinical trials using its mRNA technology. </p><p>   Moderna reported net income of $3.66 billion for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $1.22 billion in the same period a year ago. </p><p>   First-quarter earnings climbed to $8.58 a share from $2.84 a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had been expecting $5.37 a share for the quarter, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Moderna is seeking U.S. authorization to expand the use of its vaccine to include children. And it is developing a modified booster shot targeting two coronavirus strains, which could be used for a fall booster campaign in the U.S. if government officials agree. </p><p>   Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said Wednesday it is possible the Food and Drug Administration in June would authorize the use of its vaccine in children ages 6 months to 5 years old. Moderna submitted a request last week for such an authorization after a study showed it safely induced immune responses in children. </p><p>   \"We feel, from a scientific standpoint, very comfortable that two doses will protect young children,\" Mr. Bancel said in an interview Wednesday. </p><p>   The FDA is expected to hold a meeting of outside vaccine advisers in June to consider the evidence. </p><p>   If regulators agree, one of the last remaining age groups still not eligible for Covid-19 vaccination in the U.S. -- children under 5 years -- could begin to receive shots. Moderna's vaccine is currently authorized for adults 18 and older, while the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech SE is cleared for anyone 5 and up. </p><p>   Moderna also is seeking clearance for use of its vaccine in children six to 17. </p><p></p>",
