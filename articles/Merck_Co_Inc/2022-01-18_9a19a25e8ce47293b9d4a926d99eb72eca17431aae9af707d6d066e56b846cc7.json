  "title": "Pfizer's New Covid-19 Pill Works Against Omicron in Lab; Three separate, unpublished lab studies indicate Paxlovid is effective against the variant despite its mutations",
  "text": "<p>The company issued the results by press release. The research hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p>\"These data suggest that our oral Covid-19 therapy can be an important and effective tool in our continued battle against this devastating virus and current variants of concern, including the highly transmissible Omicron,\" said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration last month authorized Paxlovid's use in people at high risk of severe Covid-19. Health authorities, doctors and patients say the pill is a valuable addition to the Covid-19 medicine chest because unlike other available therapies, people who are newly infected can easily take it at home to avoid becoming hospitalized.</p><p>Yet the emergence of Omicron raised questions of whether Paxlovid, as well as other Covid-19 drugs, would remain effective because the new variant carries many more mutations compared with earlier strains, especially to the spike protein that juts from the surface of the virus and plays a key role infecting cells.</p><p>Due to the changes, some Covid-19 antibody drugs don't appear to work as well against Omicron.</p><p>Many researchers suspected Paxlovid and another new antiviral pill from Merck &amp; Co. and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP would work against Omicron because both target the virus's ability to replicate, rather than the spike protein.</p><p>In one lab study, Pfizer researchers tested nirmatrelvir against a key enzyme called protease that the virus needs to generate copies of itself. Nirmatrelvir blocked the protease target in Omicron to the same degree it blocked the enzyme in the original strain, Pfizer said.</p><p>In a second lab study, the resulting antiviral activity against Omicron was in line with activity Pfizer observed in several other variants of concern, including Beta and Delta.</p><p>The third study, performed by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai inn New York City with Pfizer, measured nirmatrelvir's efficacy against Omicron and other strains and found a similar concentration of the drug was needed to block infection.</p><p>Paxlovid supply has been limited as Pfizer works to increase manufacturing.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
