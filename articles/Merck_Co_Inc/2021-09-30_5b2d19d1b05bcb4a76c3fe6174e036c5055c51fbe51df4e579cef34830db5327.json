  "text": "<p>Merck has struck an $11.5bn deal to buy Acceleron Pharma to expand its growing pipeline of cardiovascular treatments, and said it is on the hunt for further acquisition opportunities.</p> <p>The US life sciences group said on Thursday it would acquire US-listed Acceleron for $180 per share in cash in a deal that is expected to close in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>It is the latest in a series of acquisitions of emerging companies by large pharma groups aiming to secure access to blockbuster drugs to boost future revenues. &#xa0;Pfizer last month paid $2.3bn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d673c756-eb4c-45e1-822d-b520158768c6\">acquire</a> Trillium Therapeutics, which is developing a therapy that it hopes will be transformative for treating blood cancers. </p> <p>Acceleron, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a biotech company that develops protein-based therapies to treat certain types of cancers and rare diseases. </p> <p>The company markets Reblozyl, a drug that treats anaemia in certain blood disorders, in the US, Europe and Canada in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which owns an 11.5 per cent stake in Acceleron. </p> <p>Rob Davis, chief executive of Merck, said the deal would give Merck access to a potential blockbuster drug candidate sotatercept, a treatment for a rare high blood-pressure disorder that is in Phase 3 clinical trials. Merck said it was targeting a launch for sotatercept in 2024-25.</p> <p>Davis said he was confident Merck could successfully commercialise the drug as a foundational therapy and multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity.</p> <p>“This fits perfectly in our capital allocation and development strategy. It really rounds out and complements our cardiovascular pipeline . . . and broadens and bolsters the overall pipeline,” Davis told the Financial Times. </p> <p>Merck is seeking to diversify its drug portfolio with its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda — which generated more than a third of company revenues in the second quarter — expected to face generic competition in coming years.</p> <p>Davis said Merck would continue to look to broaden its pipeline of drugs and was prepared to accept a potential rating downgrade if the right acquisition opportunity emerged. </p> <p>Several analysts welcomed the deal, saying it provided multiple revenue-generating opportunities for Merck. </p> <p>Geoffrey Porges, analyst at SVB Leerink, said the price seemed fair given that a buyer would get 25 to 30 per cent of the value of Reblozyl, which is likely to become a $2bn-plus brand by the late 2020s. Merck would also get access to other drugs in Acceleron's pipeline, including sotatercept, he said. </p> <p>“Acceleron will offer a buyer a relatively secure $1bn to $1.5bn in estimated revenue by 2025, increasing to an estimated $2.7bn by 2030, and it is not unreasonable to expect the contribution to be $3.5bn in revenue by 2030,” said Porges. </p> <p>Acceleron's share price was down 0.4 per cent after the start of trading in New York, while Merck's rose 1.8 per cent.</p><p>Source: Adrienne Klasa in London and Jamie Smyth in New York 2021 'Merck to buy Acceleron Pharma for $11.5bn' FT.com 30 September.
