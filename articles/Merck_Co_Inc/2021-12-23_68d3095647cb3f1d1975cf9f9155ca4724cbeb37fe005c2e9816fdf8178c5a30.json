  "text": "<p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 241.11 points, or 0.7%, to 35,995.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 26.75 points, or 0.6%, at 4,723.31.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 40.69 points, or 0.3%, to trade at 15,562.58.</p><p>On Wednesday, major indexes scored gains. For the week through Wednesday, the Dow was up 1.1%, the S&amp;P 500 had gained 1.6%, and the Nasdaq advanced 2.3%.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>Stocks were off to a positive start, but traders are likely to see thinner trading volumes ahead of the long holiday weekend, with Wall Street closed on Friday, Christmas Eve.</p><p>The next week will see business as usual, albeit in likely continued thin trading. U.S. markets won't close either Friday, Dec. 31, or Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in observation of the New Year's holiday, though other global markets will.</p><p>Read:Is the stock market open on Christmas Eve? New Year's Eve? Here are the coming holiday trading hours.</p><p>Investors were digesting a fresh batch of U.S. data Thursday.</p><p>First-time jobless claims were unchanged at 205,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, while consumer spending and personal spending nudged higher, the 12-month PCE inflation indicator rose 5.7% in November, while durable goods orders rose 2.5% for the month.</p><p>New-home sales for November and the final University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December were due later Thursday.</p><p>Wednesday saw investors cheered by upbeat economic data and upbeat headlines on the omicron variant, which President Joe Biden has pledged to fight with an arsenal of measures. Adding to the positive newsflow, AstraZeneca AZNUK:AZN said Thursday that its COVID-19 booster shot was effective against the highly contagious variant, in a laboratory study.</p><p>A pair of U.K. studies released Wednesday also showed the omicron variant may be milder than the delta one, while South African medical experts have suggested the surge in cases may have peaked, with fewer hospitalizations and severe illness.</p><p>“The caveat here is that even if omicron is less dangerous, the fact that it is so much more transmissible means that health services are still at risk of being overwhelmed by the surge in new infections,” said Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, in a note to clients. “But hopes are high that the fast rollout of booster jabs in many countries will keep hospitalization rates manageable, avoiding the need for tough or prolonged lockdowns.”</p><p>With central banks such as the Fed slowly turning off the stimulus taps and President Biden's $1.75 trillion spending bill hanging in the balance, it probably won't take much to spark another panic in the markets, Boyadjian added. But for now, stocks globally are enjoying another positive day, led by strong gains in Asia and a solid open in Europe, he said.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday granted emergency use authorization to Merck &amp; Co. Inc..'s MRK antiviral drug for high-risk adults over the age of 18. Shares were down 0.7%.</p><p>Shares of Novavax NVAX fell 3.5% after the biotech company said an early study data of its COVID-19 vaccine booster showed immune responses against the omicron variant.</p><p>Shares of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics OCDX were up more than 7% after diagnostic healthcare products maker Quidel said it would buy the in-vitro diagnostics company in a $6 billion cash and stock deal.</p><p>JD.com shares JD tumbled 8.4% after Tencent said it will substantially reduce its stake in the Chinese internet company.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 1.6 basis points to 1.471%.
