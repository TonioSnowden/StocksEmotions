  "title": "U.S. News:  New Lilly Antibody Treatment  Is Authorized for Use by FDA  ----  By Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. drug regulators authorized the use of a new Covid-19 antibody drug from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. that retains effectiveness against the Omicron virus variant, filling a void after authorities stopped distributing some older antibody drugs that lost effectiveness against the strain. </p><p>   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the drug, bebtelovimab, for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in nonhospitalized individuals 12 and older who are at high risk of getting severely sick. The drug is intended for people who can't get access to alternative Covid-19 treatments, or for whom those treatments aren't appropriate. </p><p>   \"Today's action makes available another monoclonal antibody that shows activity against Omicron, at a time when we are seeking to further increase supply,\" said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"This authorization is an important step in meeting the need for more tools to treat patients as new variants of the virus continue to emerge.\" </p><p>   On Thursday, the Biden administration agreed to purchase 600,000 treatment courses of the new Lilly antibody for at least $720 million, to distribute for use in the U.S. The doses will be delivered by March 31, and the government has an option to buy an additional 500,000 doses of the drug by July 31, Lilly said. </p><p>   \"With the emergence of variants such as Omicron, treatment options remain limited,\" said Daniel Skovronsky, president of Lilly's research labs. \"Lilly is pleased to provide another treatment option to help address the ongoing needs of patients and healthcare providers who continue to battle this pandemic.\" </p><p>   Indianapolis-based Lilly and other companies have provided Covid-19 antibody drugs since late 2020. The drugs are essentially clones of naturally occurring immune-system antibodies that can fight off the coronavirus. </p><p>   But the emergence of virus variants has complicated the use of these injected treatments because the variants have mutations that make them less susceptible. </p><p>   Lilly previously sold two other Covid-19 antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, which together generated $2.24 billion in sales during 2021. </p><p>   Most recently, they were used in combination to treat Covid-19, but in January the FDA restricted their use because tests found they lost potency against the Omicron variant, which had become the dominant strain of coronavirus. Now, those antibodies can only be used if someone is infected with other strains. </p><p>   The FDA placed similar limitations on a Covid-19 antibody combination from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. The federal government also paused the distribution of the Lilly and Regeneron antibodies, though it continued to distribute another, sotrovimab from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which has retained effectiveness against Omicron. </p><p>   At the same time, the FDA has recently cleared new antiviral pills from Pfizer Inc. and Merck &amp; Co., which are likely to be more convenient for patients to take at home rather than go to a healthcare facility for an antibody IV infusion. </p><p></p>",
