  "text": "<p>   A year into retirement, Mr. Lord joined the board of his alma mater, Penn State. That is when, he said, he had an epiphany: Colleges were incredibly inefficient businesses, and the student-loan program enabled them. </p><p>   He was stunned to learn how big Penn State's budget was, about $5 billion, and how quickly it grew. (Penn State's budget is currently $7.7 billion.) He recalled the athletic department requesting approval for a costly renovation of the football stadium to improve the experience for fans. Mr. Lord was aghast. \"All they need to get fans is to win,\" Mr. Lord said. </p><p>   A Penn State spokeswoman said the school has raised tuition to offset state budget cuts and that it is \"a leader on cost control.\" </p><p>   Mr. Lord said that after raising spending concerns at one board meeting, a fellow member -- Kenneth Frazier, executive chairman of drugmaker Merck &amp; Co. -- took him aside in a hallway. \"Al, this isn't your company. They don't think the way you're thinking,\" Mr. Frazier said, according to Mr. Lord. Mr. Frazier couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Lord declined to run for a second term on the board in 2017. It was also around that time that his grandchildren started attending college, which he said triggered thoughts about how he worked his way through school. \"A thousand dollars or a $1,500-a-year education was in bounds,\" he said. \"You could reach for it or pay for it, and I didn't take on any debt.\" In-state tuition and room and board at Penn State now costs as much as $36,278 a year. </p><p>   As student debt approaches $2 trillion and congressional Democrats call on President Biden to cancel a huge swath of it, he said he opposes proposals for free college and for forgiving student loans. \"Are we trying to create deadbeats out of our young people at age 22?\" he asked. </p><p>   He does, however, admit he had a hand to play in the rising expense of higher education. At Sallie Mae, he said, he viewed his role as single-mindedly increasing the company's stock value, which prevented him from publicly raising concerns about high tuition. His responsibility was solely to shareholders, not to society at large, he said, and that meant catering to colleges. </p><p>   \"Our customer was almost every bit as much the college as it was the student,\" he said. \"It didn't behoove me to lose 100% of the business for something that might make an iota of a difference. No one was looking to me for that kind of information.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Adapted from \"The Debt Trap\" by Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Mitchell, to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. on August 3. </p><p></p>",
