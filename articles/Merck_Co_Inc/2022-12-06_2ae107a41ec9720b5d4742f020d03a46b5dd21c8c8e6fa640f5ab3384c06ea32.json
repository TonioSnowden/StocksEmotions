  "title": "Avalon BioVentures Raises $135 Million Biotech Fund; Firm launches biotech companies through its accelerator",
  "text": "<p>In recent years, Avalon's biotech investors have seen several companies go public or be acquired, as the life-sciences sector overall boomed. They include biotechs such as Calporta Therapeutics Inc., acquired by drugmaker Merck &amp; Co. in 2019, and Janux Therapeutics Inc., which went public in 2021.</p><p>That run prompted the biotech team to split off into a separate business, said Jay Lichter, a managing partner of La Jolla, Calif.-based Avalon BioVentures.</p><p>Avalon Ventures founder Kevin Kinsella is an emeritus partner with Avalon BioVentures.</p><p>Avalon Ventures' biotech portfolio was in rhythm with a hot market and matured a little more robustly than the tech side, Dr. Lichter said. Its tech team, which remains intact, will invest the current fund for the next couple of years and assess the market for an opportunity to raise another fund, he added.</p><p>Avalon BioVentures, an early-stage investor, began fundraising late last year and closed the fund in the fall, beating its $100 million goal, Dr. Lichter said. Investors in the pool weren't deterred by the recent slowdown in the market for biotech stocks because startups the firm is backing now won't be ready to go public for a few years, he said.</p><p>Avalon Ventures launched several of its biotech portfolio companies through its accelerator, where life-sciences startups share space and resources such as capital equipment. Avalon BioVentures plans to continue that approach and invest mostly in startups hatched through this same accelerator, Dr. Lichter said.</p><p>Avalon's life-sciences team has filled an important role in the biotech ecosystem through the partners' ability to identify promising new science, often in academic labs, and build companies around it, said David Campbell, a former entrepreneur-in-residence with Avalon Ventures and now chief executive of Janux Therapeutics, a cancer drug developer he founded in 2017 while at Avalon.</p><p>\"They've honed their skills with [their] ability to recognize early-stage startup opportunities,\" Dr. Campbell said.</p><p>Janux is developing T-cell engagers—which bind to cancer cells and recruit T cells of the immune system to eradicate the tumor cells—that could be safer and more effective than existing drugs in this class. Janux began with an idea for making biological cancer drugs safer by limiting their activity to the tumor, according to Dr. Campbell. Avalon then supported the company as it developed its scientific approach in the accelerator, Dr. Campbell added.</p><p>Avalon BioVentures expects to invest the new fund in about 10 companies, Dr. Lichter said.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
