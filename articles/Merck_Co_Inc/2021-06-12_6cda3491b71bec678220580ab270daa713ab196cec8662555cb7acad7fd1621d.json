  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Weekend Confidential:  Ursula Burns  ---  The former Xerox CEO on how to make achievements like hers less rare.  ----  By Emily Bobrow",
  "text": "<p>   Ursula Burns became the chief executive officer of Xerox in July 2009, and she admits that she is still irked by the media coverage at the time. As the first Black female CEO of a Fortune 500 company, her promotion was historic -- not least because she was succeeding another woman, Anne Mulcahy. But most news reports, she says, were more interested in her novelty than in what it took for her to get there. </p><p>   \"I wanted the stories to go one step further, to try to understand why it's so rare,\" Ms. Burns, 62, said over the phone from her home in Manhattan. \"I wanted them to ask, 'How did it happen at Xerox?'\" </p><p>   The answer, she says, is that the company had been making diversity a priority for over half a century by the time she became the boss. As Ms. Burns explains in her new memoir, \"Where You Are Is Not Who You Are,\" out June 15 from Amistad, Xerox was based in Rochester, N.Y., when the city was torn by race riots in 1964. Joseph Wilson, the company's founder, responded by swiftly hiring Black laborers and suppliers. Xerox also recruited minority scientists and engineers, including Lloyd Bean, Ms. Burns's \"brilliant\" husband, who began patenting inventions for the company in the 1960s (he died in 2019). </p><p>   Vernon Jordan, a civil-rights leader, joined Xerox's board of directors in 1974 and was soon mentoring Ms. Burns, who arrived in 1980 as an intern while studying mechanical engineering at Brooklyn Polytechnic (now part of New York University). Ms. Burns says that Xerox was \"very diverse,\" at least comparatively. When she returned full-time in 1981, after earning her master's degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia University, \"I was the only Black engineer in my hiring class, but I was one,\" she said. \"Most companies had none.\" </p><p>   Four decades later, Ms. Burns --  who left Xerox in late 2016 and now serves on the boards of Exxon, Uber and M.I.T., among others -- is distressed by how few women and people of color have joined her at the top. Just five Fortune 500 companies have Black CEOs, and the number will drop to four when Kenneth Frazier, Merck's CEO, steps down later this month. A record 41 women now run Fortune 500 companies, but that is still less than 10%. </p><p>   \"There are still huge companies who have zero diversity on their board, zero diversity in their leadership team and zero diversity in their supplier base,\" Ms. Burns observes. Although American firms are hiring more women and people of color at the entry level -- not least because women earn the majority of college degrees -- she notes that the pipeline slows to a trickle on the way up. Part of the problem, she says, is that corporations often throw money at flimsy concepts like diversity training instead of investing in retaining and advancing talented staff. </p><p>   Ms. Burns's ascent at Xerox came with the support of many champions, but she says her path could easily have gone another way. She was raised with her older brother and younger sister in a cockroach-infested housing project on the Lower East Side, by a single mother from Panama who \"sacrificed her life, literally, for her children,\" Ms. Burns says. Her mother died at the age of 49 after a lifetime of hard work, including cleaning offices and taking in laundry. Ms. Burns went to Catholic school, where the $650 tuition took a huge chunk of the family's income. She worked hard, excelled at math and earned scholarships to study engineering, after learning that the degree ensured the best-paid jobs for new graduates. \"Don't let the world happen to you,\" her mother often told her. \"You happen to the world.\" </p><p>   After years of traveling to Japan and the U.K. to help Xerox plan and build an array of new modules and machines, Ms. Burns was in her late 20s when her outspokenness in a meeting brought her to the attention of Wayland Hicks, the firm's second-in-command. Mr. Hicks, who regularly mentored potential rising stars, urged her to be less blunt and visibly impatient in meetings and asked her to be his executive assistant. \"I learned a lot about leadership by watching Wayland operate,\" she writes. </p><p>   Paul Allaire, Xerox's then-CEO, swiftly poached Ms. Burns to work for him, and then tested her with a series of challenges, including turning around a Texas-based fax business, shifting the company's European operations to London and overseeing the company's manufacturing and supply chain. Ms. Burns says that she was able to put in long hours because her husband, 20 years her senior, offered to retire and stay home with their son and daughter. </p><p>   When Ms. Burns became CEO, after years of grooming under Ms. Mulcahy, Xerox was in a precarious position. The country was reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, and the rise of paperless technologies had sidelined paper-processing machines and copiers, which forced the company to look for new sources of revenue. In an effort to get Xerox \"out of a continually shrinking market,\" Ms. Burns cut costs and tried to recast the company as a business-services supplier. The strategy paid off, but not enough to make up for declines in its core products. </p><p>   Ms. Burns ended up stepping down after tussling with Carl Icahn, an activist investor, whom she derides for \"disrupting\" companies instead of \"adding value.\" Xerox's share price is now slightly lower than when she left. \"Look at where he is now and tell me, is that better? I would say not,\" she says. </p><p>   Mr. Icahn, however, notes that Xerox's stock had crested nearly 70% higher than it had under Ms. Burns before the pandemic depressed sales for office machinery. He adds that his investments across his portfolio have enhanced \"value for shareholders by hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.\" </p><p>   The #MeToo movement and last year's racial unrest have put pressure on corporations to diversify their ranks. To help them along, Ms. Burns now leads the Board Diversity Action Alliance, founded in September 2020 by the Ford Foundation, the public relations and advisory company Teneo and the Executive Leadership Council, which gets companies to pledge to include one or more Black directors on their boards. Dow, Macy's, Starbucks and UPS are among the signatories. </p><p>   Ms. Burns now believes in mandating diversity quotas for company directors. She admits that she \"loathes\" this approach -- \"It's taking a hatchet to something that needs a paring knife\" -- but insists it is necessary in the absence of real progress. It also makes good business sense, she argues, given the studies that show that companies with more diverse boards tend to perform better. \"We're saying there are enough qualified people for this,\" she says. \"I don't know what else to do, wait 20 more years?\" </p><p>   When she was younger, Ms. Burns chalked up her success to her hard work and smarts. Now, looking back, she wonders where she would be without her mother's \"maniacal\" faith in education. Would she have gotten ahead if she hadn't worked for a company that saw promise in a young Black woman with \"a huge Afro\"? </p><p>   This is why it bothers Ms. Burns when people say she is \"spectacular.\" The implication, she says, is that there aren't many others just like her. \"I meet them all the time. I grew up with some of them,\" she says. \"They could be here, too. They just didn't get the chance.\" </p><p></p>",
