  "title": "How Gilead is positioning Veklury against COVID-19 antivirals like Paxlovid; The company has an oral version of its COVID-19 drug Veklury in a clinical trial",
  "text": "<p>Gilead first received emergency authorization for remdesivir, as it was then called, as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients on May 1, 2020, making it the first new drug to demonstrate it helped hospitalized COVID-19 patients during one of the darkest points in the pandemic.</p><p>The authorization sent Gilead's stock soaring, hitting a three-year high of $80.00 on April 30, the day before the anticipated authorization. Shares have since pulled back, with Gilead's stock closing at $61.77 on Tuesday.</p><p>The antiviral is now widely considered part of the standard of care for COVID-19 patients, including being listed as a preferred therapy by the National Institutes of Health. It's also been a moneymaker for Gilead, bringing in $2.8 billion in sales in 2020 and $5.5 billion in 2021, and it was one of the company's top-selling drugs last year, second only to HIV drug Biktarvy.</p><p>A report published earlier this year found that U.S. hospitals represented by the group-purchasing organization Vizient Inc. had more in total spending on Veklury than any other drug in 2021, including mega-blockbusters like AbbVie Inc.'s ABBV rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira and Merck &amp; Co. Inc.'s MRK cancer therapy Keytruda.</p><p>But the authorizations at the end of last year of Pfizer Inc.'s PFE Paxlovid and Merck's Lagevrio shifted interest toward COVID-19 medications that don't require a trip to an infusion center.</p><p>\"There will always be a role for both oral and IV therapies,\" Merdad Parsey, Gilead's chief medical officer, told investors in February, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. \"As availability of oral therapies becomes broader, they're used relatively early in the course of disease. Many people may progress and/or not get treated early enough and end up in the hospital. And, at that point, I think that'sâ€¦where the role of IV therapies is going to come in.\"</p><p>That said, Gilead has an oral formulation of Veklury in clinical trials, with Phase 1 data expected sometime this summer.</p><p>The company is expected to bring in $1.1 billion in sales of Veklury in the first quarter of this year, for a total of $2.1 billion in sales for the year, according to a FactSet consensus. Gilead has set guidance of $2 billion in sales of Veklury this year, with the assumption that omicron is the year's only major surge.</p><p>\"It may be possible GILD could have a higher tail than expected,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams told investors in February, citing the ongoing clinical studies of the oral version of Veklury.</p><p>The company is set to report its first-quarter earnings on Thursday.</p><p>Gilead's stock has declined 14.9% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500 SPX is down 12.4%.</p><p>How Gilead is positioning Veklury against COVID-19 antivirals like Paxlovid</p>",
