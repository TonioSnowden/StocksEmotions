  "title": "Merck Strikes $1.35 Billion Deal  For Bone-Marrow-Drug Developer  ----  By Jonathan D. Rockoff",
  "text": "<p>   Merck &amp; Co. has agreed to buy blood-cancer biotech Imago BioSciences Inc. for $1.35 billion, the big drugmaker's latest deal in search of new sources of sales. </p><p>   Under the terms, Merck said Monday it would pay $36 a share cash for Imago, which is developing drugs to treat bone-marrow diseases. Merck said it expected the deal to close during the first quarter next year. </p><p>   Merck has been seeking deals to add fast-growing products and promising drugs in development as it prepares for the patent expiration on its top-selling product, a cancer immunotherapy called Keytruda. </p><p>   Keytruda had $17.2 billion of Merck's $48.7 billion in worldwide sales last year. The therapy's patent is expected to expire in 2028. </p><p>   Merck Chief Executive Robert Davis, who took the helm of the company last year after serving as its chief financial officer, has said dealmaking and research partnerships are a priority. </p><p>   \"This acquisition of Imago augments our pipeline and strengthens our presence in the growing field of hematology,\" Mr. Davis said. </p><p>   Imago's lead drug candidate is targeting conditions known as myeloproliferative neoplasms, which are marked by excessive production of blood cells. The drug, called bomedemstat, blocks a protein that plays a role in the maturation of blood cells in the bone marrow. </p><p>   Bomedemstat is in mid-stage, or Phase 2, testing. Among the diseases it is targeting is myelofibrosis, a rare type of blood cancer that causes scarring in the bone marrow, which disrupts its production of healthy blood cells. </p><p>   Last year, Merck boughtAcceleron and its experimental drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The drug recently had positive results in a key study. Analysts expect the therapy could be a multibillion-dollar seller. </p><p>   Merck, of Kenilworth, N.J., was in advanced talks to buy cancer-drug biotech Seagen, but the sides couldn't reach an agreement, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Big pharmaceutical companies, in some cases fueled by cash piles generated by Covid-19 products, have been hunting for acquisitions that can provide faster sales growth after shedding slower-growing assets. </p><p>   Earlier this year, Pfizer Inc. bought sickle-cell disease drugmakerGlobal Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion. Also this year, Amgen Inc. paid $3.7 billion for ChemoCentryx and its recently approved drug for a rare immune-system condition. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Laura Cooper contributed to this article </p><p></p>",
