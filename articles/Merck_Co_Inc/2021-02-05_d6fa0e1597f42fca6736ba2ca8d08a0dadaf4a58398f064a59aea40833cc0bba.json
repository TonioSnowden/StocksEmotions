  "title": "Business News: Merck's Frazier to Retire as CEO --- Finance chief Robert Davis will take over drugmaker's top position this summer",
  "text": "<p>\"It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decade,\" Mr. Frazier, 66 years old, said on the company's earnings call Thursday.</p><p>Under Mr. Frazier's leadership, Merck became a leader in the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy and in the development of the drug Keytruda, now one of its top sellers. The therapy, which treats lung and other cancers, totaled more than $14 billion in global sales last year.</p><p>Keytruda's success has lifted Merck's market capitalization to a record high $234 billion last year but has come down slightly. Since the company released positive study results for Keytruda in April 2018, Merck shares are up about 35.4%, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 47.9% gain.</p><p>Mr. Frazier, a lawyer who has led Merck since 2011, is among the few Black CEOs at S&amp;P 500 companies and has been a leading industry voice in recent years encouraging companies to hire more Black employees. He steered Merck through criticism about how the industry prices its medications.</p><p>Mr. Frazier's exit was anticipated after the board allowed him to remain CEO three years ago, waiving the requirement that the company's chief retire at 65.</p><p>Merck's board considered internal and external candidates, but the finalists were all Merck executives: Mr. Davis, Mike Nally, chief marketing officer, and Frank Clyburn, chief commercial officer, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Despite Keytruda's success, some investors and analysts worry Merck's growth might depend on the therapy too heavily. The drugmaker has done deals for small companies to augment its pipeline in the last couple of years, and it plans to spin off some slow-growth legacy products.</p><p>The selection of Mr. Davis, 54, likely signals intensified business development to reduce the company's dependency on Keytruda, according to a Thursday note from Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Baum. Keytruda sales made up nearly one-third of the company's approximate $48 billion in revenue last year, Merck said Thursday.</p><p>Still, Mr. Davis's elevation suggests Merck's overall strategy is likely to remain steady in the short term, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, although he added that \"part of me wonders if this is a way to speed up and accelerate decision-making\" for deals.</p><p>A graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Frazier worked at law firm Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath before joining Merck in 1992. He became general counsel in 1999 and defended Merck from allegations that its painkiller Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck agreed in 2007 to pay $4.85 billion to settle thousands of claims.</p><p>Issues of race and the workplace have been important to Mr. Frazier, who last month helped start a nonprofit organization with other CEOs to connect employers with Black workers.</p><p>One of Mr. Frazier's key moves early on was bringing back Roger Perlmutter to Merck in 2013 to lead its R&amp;D. Dr. Perlmutter has since been credited with reviving the company's labs after several setbacks. Dr. Perlmutter retired in December, turning the research reins over to Dr. Dean Li.</p><p>In reporting fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, Merck said it expects total revenue this year of between $51.8 billion and $53.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.48 to $6.68 a share. Analysts had been forecasting revenue of $51.66 billion and an adjusted profit of $6.30 a share.</p><p>Merck's quarterly revenue of $12.5 billion was up 5% from $11.9 billion in the year-earlier quarter, as Keytruda sales rose nearly one-third to around $4 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting revenue of $12.67 billion in the latest period.</p>",
