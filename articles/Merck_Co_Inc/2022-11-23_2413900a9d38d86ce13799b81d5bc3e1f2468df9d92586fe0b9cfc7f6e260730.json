The treatment is the first locally developed alternative to Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid and Merck &amp; Co.'s Lagevrio, which have been authorized for emergency use in Japan. Shionogi aims to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its pill in the U.S. </p><p>\n  Osaka-based Shionogi filed in February for emergency approval for the drug, known as Xocova, in Japan. The health ministry panel said in July it needed to see results from a larger human trial because data submitted at the time didn't sufficiently show improvements in symptoms associated with Covid-19. </p><p>\n  Shionogi's recent data showed that those who were given the drug once a day for five days recovered from symptoms 24 hours faster than those who received a placebo. Shionogi's pill is designed to be taken once a day without any additional medication. </p><p>\n  Shionogi has said it is in talks with the FDA and is carrying out global clinical trials. </p><p>\n  -- Megumi Fujikawa </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BRAZIL </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Bolsonaro Challenges </p><p>\n  Election Defeat </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  More than three weeks after losing a reelection bid, President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday blamed a software bug and demanded the electoral authority annul votes cast on most of Brazil's nation's electronic voting machines, though independent experts say the bug doesn't affect the reliability of results. </p><p>\n  Such an action would leave Bolsonaro with 51% of the remaining valid votes -- and a reelection victory, Marcelo de Bessa, the lawyer who filed the request on behalf of the president and his Liberal Party, said. </p><p>\n  The electoral authority has already declared victory for Bolsonaro's nemesis, leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and even many of the president's allies have accepted the results. Protesters across the country have refused to do the same, particularly with Bolsonaro declining to concede. </p><p>\n  Liberal Party leader Valdemar Costa and an auditor hired by the party said their evaluation found all machines dating from before 2020 lacked individual identification numbers in internal logs. Neither explained how that might have affected election results, but said they were asking the electoral authority to invalidate all votes cast on those machines. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  TURKEY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ankara Hints of New </p><p>\n  Offensive in Syria </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Turkey's president again hinted at a possible new ground offensive in Syria against Kurdish militants Tuesday, as Syrian forces denounced new airstrikes and Russia urged restraint and called on Ankara to avoid an escalation. </p><p>\n  Russia's presidential envoy in Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said Turkey should \"show a certain restraint\" to prevent an escalation in Syria, where tensions heightened over the weekend after Turkish airstrikes killed and wounded Syrian soldiers. </p><p>\n  Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces later said fresh Turkish airstrikes Tuesday struck a base that the group shares with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. Two SDF fighters were killed, the group said. </p><p>\n  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey's actions wouldn't be limited to aerial strikes, suggesting a possible new incursion. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
