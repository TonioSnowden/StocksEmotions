ECB President Christine Lagarde pushed back against rising market expectations for rate increases by the end of next year, but failed to reverse bets on such a move.</p><p>See: ECB's Lagarde pushes back against rising interest rate-hike expectations, but markets don't listen</p><p>Those moves come as the Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its two-day rate-setting gathering Nov. 2-3, where it is widely expected to announce and start tapering of its monthly purchases of $120 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>“If anything, following yesterday's news of an unexpected sharp widening of the merchandise trade deficit in September, the balance of risks to that estimate appear to lie to the downside, with net exports perhaps subtracting 1 percentage point from growth,” said Emily Nicol, economist at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.</p><p>In political news, President Biden is set to release a new framework on the Democrats' $1.75 trillion social spending and climate package which is aimed at winning support of congressional Democrats, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar.</p><p>Looking ahead, Amazon.com Inc.
