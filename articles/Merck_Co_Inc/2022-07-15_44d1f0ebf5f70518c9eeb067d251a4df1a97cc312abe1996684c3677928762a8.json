  "title": "Merck Deal for Seagen Seen as Unlikely by Earnings Release; Deal talks still on track but upcoming data, arbitration slowed timeline, people familiar with the matter say",
  "text": "<p>The change is due partly to a need to wait for data expected soon from a study evaluating one of Seagen's treatments, the people said. There is also a desire to possibly see the outcome of a royalties-payments case Seagen is pursuing that is also expected soon, the people said. Both could have an impact on Seagen's valuation.</p><p>There is still no guarantee the companies will reach agreement on a takeover deal. Merck is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings July 28.</p><p>Acquiring Seagen would help Merck broaden its lineup of cancer drugs, currently led by the blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda.</p><p>Seagen helped pioneer a class of drugs known as antibody drug conjugates. The therapies take advantage of the honing abilities of antibody drugs to deliver a potent toxin to a specific tumor target.</p><p>As soon as this month, a study evaluating Seagen's Padcev as a first-line treatment for bladder cancer could produce data. The study is examining Padcev's use alone and in combination with Keytruda, according to analysts.</p><p>Padcev is currently approved to treat bladder-cancer patients who had failed a previous therapy. Sales for treating first-line bladder cancer could amount to billions of dollars a year if study results are positive and regulators approve the use, analysts have estimated.</p><p>A combination with Keytruda for bladder cancer could also help Merck extend the commercial life of its product after current patents run out later this decade, according to the analysts.</p><p>Additionally, Seagen could receive significant royalties and milestone payments if it wins an arbitration case and other litigation against Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd., a former partner that went on to develop its own line of antibody drug conjugates including a breast-cancer therapy called Enhertu.</p><p>Seagen has alleged that Enhertu and the rest of Daiichi's antibody-drug-conjugate pipeline infringes on Seagen's patented technology, while Daiichi has said Enhertu doesn't rely on Seagen's technology, according to analysts. Daiichi sells Enhertu with AstraZeneca PLC.</p><p>A ruling in the arbitration case is expected as early as this summer, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Jonathan D.
