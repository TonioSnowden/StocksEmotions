  "title": "Banking & Finance:  IFF, Icahn Reach a Settlement Deal  ----  By Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca",
  "text": "<p>    International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. reached a settlement agreement with activist investor Carl Icahn that will add a new director to the big ingredient maker's board. </p><p>   As part of the agreement unveiled on Wednesday with the company's earnings, IFF is adding Barry Bruno, the chief marketing officer of consumer-goods company Church &amp; Dwight Co., as an independent director. </p><p>   Mr. Icahn has a roughly $600 million stake in IFF, people familiar with the matter said. IFF has a market value of around $33 billion. </p><p>   An entity related to Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital also has an investment in IFF, the people said. It couldn't be learned which entity. </p><p>   IFF shares closed up 2.9% after The Wall Street Journal reported on the imminent settlement and 3G's stake Wednesday afternoon. </p><p>   The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.03 billion and net income of $90 million. It said it expects its 2022 sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion. </p><p>   In 2019, chemical giant DuPont de Nemours Inc. reached a deal to combine its nutrition business with IFF, creating a company that would be a top supplier of ingredients to U.S. food makers. The company also provides soy proteins, probiotics, enzymes and other ingredients for creating scents and tastes for consumer products. </p><p>   Shares of New York-based IFF have stagnated for the past five years, and since the DuPont deal the company has attracted several hedge funds and investors keen on monitoring its progress integrating the operations. </p><p>   The company named a new chief executive officer in January, the same day CNBC reported that Mr. Icahn had a 4% stake. Former Merck &amp; Co. executive Frank Clyburn took over for Andreas Fibig, and the company also separated the role of CEO and chairman. </p><p>   Another activist, Sachem Head Capital Management LP, reached a settlement agreement with IFF in March that gave its founder, Scott Ferguson, an option to join the board from September to December 2021, which he didn't exercise. </p><p>   For Mr. Icahn, the IFF investment is a relatively friendly one, similar to an investment in utility FirstEnergy Corp., given his respect for Edward Breen, the DuPont chief executive who now sits on IFF's board, some of the people said. </p><p>   3G, known for orchestrating the merger of Kraft and Heinz and other deal making, has been relatively quiet in recent years after the food company struggled to keep up with changing consumer tastes. But the investment firm made its first big splash in a while when it struck a $6.9 billion deal in December to buy a majority stake in Dutch window-coverings maker Hunter Douglas NV. </p><p></p>",
