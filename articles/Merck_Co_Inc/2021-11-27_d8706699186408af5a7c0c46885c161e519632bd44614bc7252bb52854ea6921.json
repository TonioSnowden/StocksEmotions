  "title": "U.S. News: Merck's Covid-19 Pill Was 30% Effective in Final Study",
  "text": "<p>The FDA said it is still conducting its review of molnupiravir, after the companies told the agency earlier this week the pill was 30% effective in a final analysis of the late-stage study results. After taking an early look at results, the companies had reported in October that molnupiravir was 50% effective.</p><p>Molnupiravir, and another experimental antiviral from Pfizer Inc. that is also under FDA review, promise to fill a big gap in Covid-19 treatment for a pill that people could easily take at home to keep them out of the hospital.</p><p>So far, people at high risk of severe disease seeking to avoid hospitalization have usually had to go to a hospital or clinic that can inject or infuse an antibody drug.</p><p>The U.K. cleared molnupiravir for use earlier this month.</p><p>The latest molnupiravir efficacy rate is disappointing, but the drug could still be a helpful treatment because it will be more convenient and easier to access than the antibody drugs available, said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Thirty percent is still meaningful in a disease to prevent someone from being hospitalized,\" he said.</p><p>Antibody drugs from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and from GlaxoSmithKline PLC and its partner Vir Biotechnology Inc. were found in testing to cut the risk of hospitalization or death by at least 70%.</p><p>An experimental pill from Pfizer Inc., which also is under FDA review, cut the risk of hospitalization and death by about 89% in an early look at data. That rate could change after Pfizer performs a final analysis.</p><p>FDA staff reviews are a routine part of the regulatory evaluation process before the agency decides whether to green light a product. Merck and Ridgeback requested emergency use authorization last month.</p><p>The drug's clinical-trial performance is expected to be discussed Tuesday when an outside panel of advisers to the FDA meets and votes whether to recommend the agency clear the drug for use.</p><p>The FDA isn't required to follow the panel's advice but normally does. Should the panel give a thumbs-up, an FDA decision could come before the end of the year. The agency hasn't scheduled a meeting of the panel to review Pfizer's drug, called Paxlovid.</p><p>Researchers designed molnupiravir to work by mucking up the virus's ability to replicate, by introducing errors into its genetic code.</p><p>A course of treatment is eight pills daily for five days, started within five days of showing symptoms.</p><p>In the documents it posted, the FDA said it became aware of the final analysis earlier this week and was still reviewing the data. The agency said its assessment, which was based on the interim analysis, might change, and that it would provide additional analysis when the panel meets Tuesday.</p><p>The FDA asked the panel to discuss the use of molnupiravir in pregnant women, who weren't included in the late-stage Merck-Ridgeback trial.</p><p>The agency said Merck agreed that molnupiravir shouldn't be authorized for people under 18 years of age. It also said the drug shouldn't be cleared for use in hospitalized patients, after the drug failed to show benefit in a separate trial.</p><p>The company plans to manufacture 10 million courses of treatment by the end of the year and at least double that amount next year.</p><p>Merck has agreed to provide the U.S. government with 3.1 million courses of molnupiravir for about $2.2 billion, should regulators clear the pill for use.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
