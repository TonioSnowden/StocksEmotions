  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson must seize its “golden moment” and break up, outgoing chief executive Alex Gorsky has told investors at the world's biggest healthcare company.</p> <p>“We are proud of our iconic history, but we're not iconoclasts,” Gorsky said as he reflected on last week's decision by the 135-year-old company to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4a0986d-2c82-4e4a-973d-2de3247033aa\">spin off its consumer division</a> and pursue higher growth for its combined pharmaceuticals and medical device business. </p> <p>Scientific innovation, changes in the consumer environment and the coronavirus pandemic persuaded the J&amp;J board to approve a long-discussed spin-off of the consumer business within 24 months, Gorsky added at an investor briefing on Thursday.</p> <p>The shift in strategy marks a watershed for a company best known for inventing Band-Aids and baby products and delivering steady, if not spectacular returns, to shareholders. Its success in the future will rely heavily on J&amp;J's high-margin drug business, which delivers a wide range of treatments for everything from cancer to eye diseases. </p> <p>“I have never been more optimistic,” said Gorsky, as his executive team laid out glitzy presentations to analysts showing how J&amp;J's pharmaceutical division expects to increase annual revenues to $60bn by 2025, up from $45.6bn in 2020.</p> <p>In a demonstration of its confidence in its drug pipeline, J&amp;J touted 14 new blockbuster drugs capable of generating $1bn or more in revenue in position by 2025 — at least five of these medicines have the potential to generate more than $5bn a year. </p> <p>Despite the fanfare, however, investors have given a lukewarm reception to J&amp;J's consumer spin-off. Shares in the company are flat since the new strategy was announced on November 11.</p> <p>Analysts blame a lack of detail around the future strategy for the consumer business, the long timeframe before the demerger takes place and continuing concerns around J&amp;J's liabilities related to almost 40,000 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de13b1ec-9b4a-4a27-ae63-c8ea38ffc683\">legal claims</a> that its baby talcum powder causes cancer.</p> <p>“With the spin-off potentially being up to two years away, it will probably take some time before investors have a clear picture of the growth potential of the new consumer company,” said Ashtyn Evans, analyst at Edward Jones.</p> <p>J&amp;J's consumer business sells skin, beauty and healthcare brands such as Tylenol, Listerine and Neutrogena, which have helped establish it as one of America's most trusted companies over more than a century. But it faces tough competition from Procter &amp; Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline's consumer business, which is also spinning off from its group, and a wave of smaller companies tapping into demand for organic and natural ingredients.</p> <p>Total sales in J&amp;J's consumer health business grew just 1 per cent to $14.05bn in 2020, compared with the previous year, and was just under a fifth of total group sales. In comparison, sales at the pharma division grew 8 per cent to $45bn last year. </p> <p>J&amp;J is following a trend in the pharmaceutical sector, as companies dispose of slower growing consumer healthcare divisions to concentrate on drug discovery. Merck sold its consumer products division to P&amp;G in 2018. A year later GSK and Pfizer formed a joint venture from their consumer products divisions, which they plan to spin off next year.</p> <p>Emilie Feldman, professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said both J&amp;J companies could emerge “leaner and meaner” from the break-up and move more quickly in terms of making acquisitions or divestitures.</p> <p>She said in many cases the break-up of conglomerates and spin-offs occur shortly after a chief executive's departure and are typically associated with failure. What is different about J&amp;J is that Gorsky is doing the divestiture shortly before he steps down, Feldman pointed out.</p> <p>“It is sort of grabbing the bull by the horns, it's almost the opposite of the [normal],” said Feldman. “I don't know if it is legacy that is driving him to do this.”</p> <p>After almost a decade leading J&amp;J, Gorsky will hand over the reins in January to his successor Joaquin Duato, who has been at the company for three decades and will lead the new slimmed-down J&amp;J.</p> <p>But not all analysts are convinced by J&amp;J's abandonment of its decades-long diversification strategy that in the past helped it ride out volatile markets and deliver advantages in scale.</p> <p>Erik Gordon, professor at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said buzzwords used by J&amp;J to justify the spin-off, such as “greater focus” and “nimble”, probably overstate the future benefits, because each of its divisions already enjoyed a lot of autonomy.</p> <p>He also questioned J&amp;J's decision to retain the “Johnson &amp; Johnson” name within the pharma/medical devices company, rather than the brand-focused consumer business.</p> <p>“It is puzzling because they risk potentially throwing away all the brand equity of Johnson &amp; Johnson,” he said.</p> <p>Creditors could miss the stable cash flows generated by the consumer business when the pharma-led business faces challenges from loss of exclusivity from blockbuster drugs, say some critics.</p> <p>Moody's Investor Service warned the spin-off could have a negative impact on J&amp;J's coveted triple A credit rating, citing the reduction in scale, diversity and earnings following the transaction.</p> <p>But there was no sign of doubts among J&amp;J's senior executive team, as they mixed with analysts. </p> <p>“When you take a look at the assets that we have now and their continued growth potential, combined with the pipeline that we have . . . we will be able to growth through any loss of exclusivity,” Jennifer Taubert, J&amp;J executive vice-president, worldwide chair of pharmaceuticals, told the Financial Times.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e087e8db-966e-482e-97db-3e7f3fdb6f94.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Jamie Smyth in New York 2021 'Johnson &amp; Johnson touts ‘golden moment' to pursue pharma-led future' FT.com 19 November.
