  "title": "FDA Authorizes Use of New Eli Lilly Covid-19 Antibody Treatment; The drug retains effectiveness against the Omicron variant",
  "text": "<p>\"Today's action makes available another monoclonal antibody that shows activity against Omicron, at a time when we are seeking to further increase supply,\" said Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"This authorization is an important step in meeting the need for more tools to treat patients as new variants of the virus continue to emerge.\"</p><p>On Thursday, the Biden administration agreed to purchase 600,000 treatment courses of the new Lilly antibody for at least $720 million, to distribute for use in the U.S. The doses will be delivered by March 31, and the government has an option to buy an additional 500,000 doses of the drug by July 31, Lilly said.</p><p>\"With the emergence of variants such as Omicron, treatment options remain limited,\" said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, president of Lilly's research labs. \"Lilly is pleased to provide another treatment option to help address the ongoing needs of patients and healthcare providers who continue to battle this pandemic.\"</p><p>Indianapolis-based Lilly and other companies have provided Covid-19 antibody drugs since late 2020. The drugs are essentially clones of naturally occurring immune-system antibodies that can fight off the coronavirus.</p><p>But the emergence of virus variants have complicated the use of these injected treatments because the variants have mutations that make them less susceptible.</p><p>Lilly previously sold two other Covid-19 antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, which together generated $2.24 billion in sales during 2021.</p><p>Most recently, they were used in combination to treat Covid-19, but in January the FDA restricted their use because tests found they lost potency against the Omicron variant, which had become the dominant strain of coronavirus. Now those antibodies can be used only if someone is infected with other strains.</p><p>The FDA placed similar limitations on a Covid-19 antibody combination from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. The federal government also paused the distribution of the Lilly and Regeneron antibodies, though it continued to distribute another, sotrovimab from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which has retained effectiveness against Omicron.</p><p>At the same time, the FDA has recently cleared new antiviral pills from Pfizer Inc. and Merck &amp; Co., which are likely to be more convenient for patients to take at home rather than go to a healthcare facility for an antibody I.V. infusion.</p><p>These drugs, however, are in short supply until manufacturers increase production, and certain patients can't use them. The Pfizer drug can interact dangerously if taken at the same time as some other prescription medications, and the Merck drug isn't recommended for children under 18 and pregnant women because of potential safety risks.</p><p>Lilly developed its newer antibody, bebtelovimab, in collaboration with AbCellera Biologics Inc., a Canadian company that discovered the antibody with scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p><p>Lilly said laboratory tests of bebtelovimab found that it neutralized Omicron and other known variants of concern. Lilly also tested the drug in a clinical trial of Covid-19 patients, which found that it reduced patients' viral loads and time to symptom resolution, compared with a placebo, the FDA said.</p><p>Possible side effects of the drug include itching, rash, and infusion-related reactions.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Authorizes Use of New Eli Lilly Covid-19 Antibody Treatment</p>",
