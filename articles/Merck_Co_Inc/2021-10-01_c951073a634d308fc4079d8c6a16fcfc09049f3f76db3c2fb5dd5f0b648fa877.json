  "title": "Merck cheers health experts with news antiviral cut risk of hospitalization and death by half in trial, and could become powerful tool in combating COVID-19",
  "text": "<p>The drug company MRK said molnupiravir, an oral antiviral developed with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID by about 50% in an interim analysis of data from a late-stage trial.</p><p>Merck shares soared 9% in early trade as investors welcomed what will be a much-needed and long-awaited treatment for COVID. While several effective vaccines have been developed against the illness, far fewer treatments have emerged and those that have require infusions and must be administered in a clinical setting.</p><p>Molnupiravir is a pill administered orally in capsule form every 12 hours for five days, according to clinicaltrials.gov.</p><p>See also: Here's why COVID-19 booster shots are good for business</p><p>The Phase 3 trial found 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were either hospitalized or died through Day 29 following randomization, compared with 14.1% of patients given a placebo.</p><p>Through Day 29, no patients given molnupiravir died, compared with eight patients who died on placebo. The company is now planning to submit an application for an emergency use authorization for the treatment from the Food and Drug Administration and will also seek it from other regulatory bodies around the world.</p><p>Merck plans to produce 10 million courses of treatment by year-end. The U.S. government has already committed to purchasing about 1.7 million courses of the drug, once it receives an EUA.</p><p>The company said it halted the study early at the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the FDA, because the results were so positive.</p><p>Health experts applauded the news and said it would make a big difference in the fight against the coronavirus-borne illness, which has caused the deaths of almost five million people since the start of the outbreak.</p><p>https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1443913955202650116https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1443901508442071046The news comes as the U.S. is averaging just under 2,000 COVID deaths a day, according to a New York Times tracker, a small improvement over recent trends. Hospitalizations and new cases have been coming down, but the death rate had remained at more than 2,000 for the past few weeks.</p><p>Alaska remains the state with the most new cases measured on a per capita basis and its hospital system is still severely stressed. Elsewhere, some states that were recent hot spots are seeing improving trends, including Florida, which is now reporting fewer than 6,000 cases a day, down from an average of more than 20,000 cases a day during most of August.</p><p>Florida has lost 55,009 of its residents to the virus, and has had a total of 3.57 million confirmed cases.</p><p>See also:The biggest risk facing investors this earnings season is lurking just beneath the surface</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine tracker is showing that 184.6 million people living in America are fully vaccinated, equal to about 55.6% of the population, a number that has remained relatively static for weeks.</p><p>Hospital staff, who were hailed as heroes in 2020 with nightly clapping from windows and balconies, are now coming under threat from hostility, threats and violence from patients, who have become increasingly angry over safety rules aimed at stopping the spread of the virus, the Associated Press reported. </p><p>“A year ago, we're healthcare heroes and everybody's clapping for us,” said Dr. Stu Coffman, a Dallas-based emergency-room physician. “And now we're being in some areas harassed and disbelieved and ridiculed for what we're trying to do, which is just depressing and frustrating.”</p><p>Cox Medical Center Branson in Missouri started giving panic buttons to up to 400 nurses and other employees after assaults per year tripled between 2019 and 2020 to 123, a spokeswoman said. One nurse had to get her shoulder X-rayed after an attack, the AP reported.</p><p>Coronavirus Update:&#xa0;BioNTech co-founder says COVID-19 will become manageable but may persist for several years</p><p>Elsewhere, Russia set a fourth straight record daily death toll at 887, The Moscow Times reported. That brings Russia's official coronavirus death toll to 208,142 — Europe's highest.</p><p>Australia is planning to drop some international travel restrictions in November, BBC News reported. Australia's decision to fully close its borders caused controversy as it left many of its citizens overseas, but it has also succeeded in controlling the spread. Australia has recorded fewer than 1,000 deaths in the pandemic.</p><p>Finland will start vaccinating minks on fur farms against COVID with an experimental vaccine, NDTV.com reported. Minks have been found to be susceptible to contracting the illness and to pass it on to humans. Last year, Denmark culled its entire mink population as a cautionary measure.</p><p>The World Health Organization said just 2% of the populations of half of the countries in Africa have been vaccinated against COVID, AFP reported. Fifteen of the continent's 54 nations have managed to vaccinate at least 10% of their people, achieving the global goal for September 30, that the WHO set in May.</p><p>See also:&#xa0;3 prominent doctors on how best to use rapid, at-home COVID tests — and which single test has ‘been shown to be very accurate'</p><p>Latest tallies</p><p>The global tally for the coronavirus-borne illness climbed above 233.8 million on Friday, while the death toll rose above 4.78 million, according to&#xa0;data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>The U.S. continues to lead the world with a total of 43.4 million cases and 697,870 deaths.</p><p>India is second by cases after the U.S. at 33.8 million and has suffered 448,339 deaths.
