  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>Growth in the US jobs market is slowing but an unexpected drop in the unemployment rate has fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue with its aggressive tightening of monetary policy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/226135a7-0c73-45cb-a4ba-d8c5e4f415c5\">Non-farms payroll data</a> showed the economy added a better than expected 263,000 jobs in September, but with the unemployment rate falling from 3.7 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The report sent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7160e81d-d6bf-4a4a-b02e-a25f15b01474\">stocks and government bond prices lower</a> as investors banked on another 0.75 percentage point rise in interest rates from the Fed next month.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11403014.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Separate data yesterday showed higher than expected first-time <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c907698c-a286-4685-b4ef-4805d497fb0a#post-b91bfedc-69bb-4a5b-872b-d4f2fb30baab\">jobless claims</a> for the week ending October 1 while figures earlier in the week showed US employers cut <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba0993b9-215f-4f8a-80ed-09de4ed89641\">more than 1mn vacancies</a> in August, one of the biggest monthly drops in two decades of data analysed by the Financial Times, pushing the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people from 2 to 1.7. </p> <p>Workers are however still quitting at a high rate, suggesting that labour supply and demand remain out of balance. New figures from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (Jolts) had also indicated the employment market could be slowing.</p> <p>Fed officials yesterday pushed back against speculation they might pause their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7192f304-5d6b-41bf-b727-8801e79729a1\">monetary tightening campaign</a>, stressing the need for more interest rate rises.</p> <p>They argue rises in unemployment will be limited as employers will be hesitant to shed workers in the face of widespread labour shortages. The labour force participation is still below its pre-pandemic level, at 62.3 per cent. </p> <p>“It's too early to expect a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7160e81d-d6bf-4a4a-b02e-a25f15b01474\">pivot at the Fed level</a>,” said one investor. “The bar is so high. We'd need a labour market that's weaker, inflation coming down, some stress in the market or some sort of accident. We're not there yet.”</p> <p><em>Read our new special report </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/investing-america\"><em>Investing in America</em></a><em> with rankings on workforce and talent across 89 cities.</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>US introduces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6825bee4-52a7-4c86-b1aa-31c100708c3e\">tough new export control</a>s on Chinese companies</p></li>  <li><p>US moves to implement new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e6a6235-6255-41cb-ab25-1e28d2ea64eb\">EU data-sharing agreement</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc1f4240-dffa-4e28-ae4a-d31398d9bd7a\">Zuckerberg's metaverse rush</a> pauses for ‘quality lockdown'</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bf467c3-f00a-42e7-99e5-39d34fc2ac79\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>IMF chief <strong>Kristalina Georgieva</strong> warned the global economy would feel like it was in recession next year from “shrinking real incomes and rising prices”.
