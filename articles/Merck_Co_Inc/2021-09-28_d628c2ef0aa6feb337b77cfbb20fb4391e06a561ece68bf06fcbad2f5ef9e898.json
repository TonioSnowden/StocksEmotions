  "text": "<p>How are stocks trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 531 points, or 1.5%, to 34,339.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 82 points, or 1.9%, at 4,361.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 375 points, or 2.5%, to 14,595.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71 points, or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%.</p><p>What's the driving market?</p><p>Stocks were selling off as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve moving away from the accommodative policy it set during the early months of the pandemic amid concerns over elevated inflation.</p><p>“Investor anxiety is pretty elevated right now,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist with Principal Global Investors, in a phone interview Tuesday. “There's a lot going on.”</p><p>The CBOE Volatility Index VX00 was trading around 23 Tuesday afternoon, up about 40% this month, according to FactSet data, at last check.</p><p>Investors have been shunning government bonds since last week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, as traders brought forward expectations for the first interest-rate increase into late 2022.

According to Shah, some investors worry that persistently high elevation will destroy demand and put the Fed into a difficult position of tightening monetary policy into a weakening economy. Shah said that she expects inflation will stay elevated well into 2022 and then start to fade.</p><p>“Powell would have to make some very strong arguments now to stop the current rise in yields,” said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley Financial. “The 10 year Treasury has now broken through its technical resistance and things could get problematical.”</p><p>Grant said investors should be selling bonds, and using yield-paying exchange-traded and closed-end funds as income substitutes.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, meanwhile, warned that the Treasury Department is likely to exhaust extraordinary measures to keep from defaulting on its debt if Congress hasn't acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by Oct. 18.</p><p>Read: What happens if the U.S. defaults on its debt?</p><p>Energy markets are another source of concern, as Europe and Asia fight for natural-gas supplies.
