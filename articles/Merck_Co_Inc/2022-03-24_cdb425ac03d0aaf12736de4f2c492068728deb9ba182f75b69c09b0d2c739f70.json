  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> The parent company behind <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>, of which UK-sanctioned Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich </strong>is the “ultimate controlling party”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5c50dde-d601-4ca0-9a69-d33a23a2a01f\">will be allowed to inject</a> up to £30mn into the football club to help the team “resolve any cash flow or liquidity issues”.</p> <h2>The case against Wirecard's Markus Braun</h2> <p>In March 2020,<strong> Wirecard</strong>'s legal head <strong>George-Alexander Trümper </strong>made a cheeky wager that the company's boss<strong> Markus Braun</strong> and other top executives would go through with a potentially illegal plan to avoid writing down a €100mn loan.</p> <p>“[They] will take the risk, let's bet over a box of champagne,” he messaged a colleague. “MB [Braun] always says that he has one foot in prison anyway.”</p> <p>DD wonders if Trümper indulged in two boxes of champagne — one for each foot Braun currently has in his Bavarian jail cell.</p> <p>Repackaging the loan was one of many questionable moves made by Braun and his fellow executives. The FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\">dogged reporting</a> on Wirecard's spectacular accounting fraud has revealed how the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcadbdcb-5cd7-487e-afdd-1e926831e9b7\">duped auditors</a> with forged documents, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/745e34a1-0ca7-432c-b062-950c20e41f03\">surveilled and intimidated journalists</a>, sacked whistleblowers, bamboozled investors and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81779b15-7b1d-404f-b523-d61510397dd4\">lobbied</a> Germany's political elite.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4901a824-f862-4b7c-8b16-7e1ae088e729\">FT's latest read on Wirecard</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/olaf-storbeck\">Olaf Storbeck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/dan-mccrum\">Dan McCrum</a>, lays out the sprawling investigation into the scandal that spanned 25 countries and resulted in a 474-page indictment against Braun (which has not been made public). Braun's lawyers say their client is not guilty.</p> <p>Prosecutors have also indicted Wirecard's former head of accounting and deputy finance director <strong>Stephan von Erffa</strong>, and a Dubai-based executive turned chief witness against Braun who cannot be named for legal reasons.</p> <p>The trio are accused of taking part in a criminal conspiracy that involved inflating the collapsed German payment group's balance sheet by faking €1.9bn worth of business in Asia. The alleged ruse was aimed at luring in funding from banks and investors to boost Wirecard's share price and conceal its losses.</p> <p>Von Erffa has previously denied any knowledge of the fraud at a hearing in parliament, and Braun is the only member of the company's executive board to be charged. He has been charged with a litany of offences including fraud, account rigging and market manipulation which could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</p> <p>DD readers in need of a refresher on the saga can catch up with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bb36e7-54dc-463a-a6d5-70fc38a11c81\">this deep-dive</a> into Wirecard's chaotic final days. And <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Wirecard-Dan-McCrum/dp/178763504X\">don't forget to pre-order</a> <em>Money Men</em>, Dan's first-hand account blowing the lid on the scandal and the fight against Wirecard to publish the truth.</p> <p>The trial against Braun could drag on for several years, people familiar with the situation told the FT, given the number of witnesses and the complex nature of building a criminal fraud case in German courts. </p> <p>Despite troves of emails, chat protocols and other data, prosecutors may still be lacking what they call “the smoking gun”, according to a person close to the matter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Braun will be arguing that he too was the victim of the fraud rather than the perpetrator. In doing so, he'll be placing much of the blame on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a082c4fd-5626-43b8-b561-7b83e159a423\"><strong>Jan Marsalek</strong></a>, Wirecard's former operating chief who has been on the run since June 2020 when he boarded a private jet in Austria and paid the pilot in cash. Munich prosecutors say he could be hiding out in Russia, according to a person familiar with their thinking.</p> <p>The big question is whether Marsalek can stay hidden longer than Wirecard's missing €1.9bn.</p> <h2>Shareholders cast doubt on Dimon's spending plans</h2> <p>US bankers best hang on to last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36f1c72a-f63f-4404-87ab-dfbeb335cbd3\">record-breaking bonuses</a>.</p> <p>Wall Street's high spirits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31dcd748-26d2-4f7a-ad3d-a3efc05c0f25\">have been punctured</a> by recent market volatility, delivering <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <strong>Bank of America</strong>,<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Citigroup </strong>a collective $4.6bn revenue hit as equity raises all but freeze.</p> <p>To put it in perspective, the aforementioned lenders have raised just $645mn from equity capital market fees so far this year, according to <strong>Dealogic</strong> — a measly figure compared with $5.3bn in the same period last year.</p> <p>The equity drought underscores the fickle nature of investment banking. When it rains, it pours. Given that interest rate expectations have been jolted and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12dc24c9-eed3-497b-bac1-d79179d384ac\">there is waning appetite for IPOs</a>, fee revenues will tend to dry up.</p> <p>Perhaps that's one reason why JPMorgan boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> is so eager to diversify the US bank's business lines. </p> <p>Faced with the reality that the dealmaking boom won't last forever, Dimon revealed plans in January to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e543adf0-8c62-4a2c-b2d9-01fdb2f595cc\">raise tech spending</a> by an eye-popping $12bn this year as fintech challengers like <strong>Monzo</strong>, <strong>Starling</strong> and <strong>Revolut</strong> encroach on its customer base.</p> <p>An important element of that plan has been the launch of its UK digital-only consumer bank. But some JPMorgan investors have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8415b42-a711-4757-abbd-7827ccae2992\">less than thrilled about the project</a>, complaining that Dimon has given little evidence to justify his massive spending push, the FT's Josh Franklin and Stephen Morris reported.</p> <p>The UK's retail banking market is already deeply crowded and JPMorgan itself has cautioned that the spending could lead to the bank missing a target for return on tangible common equity, a crucial measure of profitability, this year and the next.</p> <p>“They touted this crazy big number,” said one JPMorgan banker. “There's a lot of head-scratching and talk internally of people like ‘we don't see this'.”</p> <p>It's rare for Dimon to be on the receiving end of ire by shareholders, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b4edb9d-3651-44e0-8431-b2c31c96af78\">as Lex points out</a>. </p> <p>A source close to the top banker's thinking told the FT that Dimon “recognises that he was too flippant” over spending plans on the most recent earnings call, and that he intends to reveal more at an upcoming investor day.</p> <p>As Wall Street's reigning “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4814a8ca-57a2-43f1-a6da-f126a4254f6d\">forever CEO</a>”, Dimon has some explaining to do if he hopes to secure his goal of spending a full two decades on the JPMorgan throne.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Janus Henderson</strong> has named former <strong>AllianceBernstein</strong> finance chief <strong>Ali Dibadj</strong> as its next chief executive. Current CEO <strong>Dick Weil</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a00b2d3-41c4-45a9-b801-0bb1ba60342b\">preparing to retire</a> from the underperforming US asset manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6acc30d7-ae37-4d63-9379-0aeb240584e0\">following pressure</a> from <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>'s activist hedge fund <strong>Trian Partners</strong>. Chief financial officer <strong>Roger Thompson</strong> will serve as interim CEO until Dibadj joins in the next few months. </p></li>  <li><p>Italy's largest insurer<strong> Generali </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2665a524-8b62-4feb-84b7-4faffb0911b4\">has suspended</a> the executive who had been put forward by one of its rebel shareholders as a rival candidate to lead the company.</p></li>  <li><p>Former <strong>State Street</strong> boss <strong>Jay Hooley</strong>, who has sat on the board of <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> since 2020, will replace outgoing Exxon board member <strong>Kenneth Frazier </strong>as lead independent director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Alibaba </strong>has appointed <strong>Weijian Shan</strong>, executive chair of investment group<strong> PAG</strong>, as an independent director to its board.</p></li>  <li><p>Hong Kong sustainability start-up <strong>MioTech</strong> <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Startup-MioTech-hires-Pinduoduo-finance-head-to-get-IPO-ready\">has tapped</a> <strong>Xu Tian</strong>, the former finance head at Chinese ecommerce group <strong>Pinduoduo</strong>, to help it become “IPO ready”, per Nikkei Asia.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>No quitters </strong>After the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/russia-central-banker-wanted-out-over-ukraine-but-putin-said-no?srnd=premium&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">tried to resign</a>. Not on Putin's watch, Bloomberg reports.</p> <p><strong>Keep it in the family</strong> Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov may be sanctioned in the US, the UK, and EU, but an analysis by The Guardian suggests that much of his business empire is safely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/oligarch-alisher-usmanov-swiss-bank-arsenal\">harboured in secret Swiss accounts</a> belonging to his sister.</p> <p><strong>Stuck in transit </strong>Joe Biden's administration has sought to reverse Trump-era rollbacks on bank regulation.
