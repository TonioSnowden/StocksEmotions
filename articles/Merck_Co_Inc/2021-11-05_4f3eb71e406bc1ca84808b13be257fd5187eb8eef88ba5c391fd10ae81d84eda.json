  "title": "Drug Sector Gets a Break --- Measures to lower costs for seniors could have been far more draconian",
  "text": "<p>The agreement, which is backed by the White House, would empower Medicare to negotiate the price of expensive drugs whose market exclusivity granted by regulators has expired. This puts sales of blockbuster drugs like the blood thinner Eliquis or the cancer drug Keytruda at risk. The agreement calls for penalties for drug companies that raise prices faster than the rate of inflation and caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 annually. It creates a $35 out-of-pocket monthly maximum for insulin, Democrats said.A trade group for drugmakers said the proposal \"threatens innovation and makes a broken health care system even worse.\"</p><p>Concern over the possibility of adverse regulation has resulted in a bad year for drug stocks: The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index returned about 10% so far this year, badly lagging behind the health sector and the overall market.</p><p>The industry outlook is brighter than investors think. For starters, the agreement compares favorably with more draconian proposals to crack down on drug prices that Congress previously considered. There is no provision for Medicare to negotiate the price of new medications; nor is there a provision to tie U.S. drug prices to what foreign countries pay for the same medicines. Meanwhile, the agreement exempts small biotech companies from negotiations with Medicare.</p><p>The deal might not realize the cost savings that Democrats expect. Barrett Thornhill, healthcare lobbyist at Forbes Tate Partners, said the proposal \"shifts the tectonic plates of pharmaceutical development and delivery without any obvious purpose,\" since inflation penalties and negotiations later in a drug's patent life create clear incentives to launch new drugs at high prices. What is more, the carve-out for small biotechs might create an incentive for more financial engineering from large companies, such as spinning off older drugs. Wall Street is unlikely to complain about that.</p><p>And meanwhile, drug stocks are on sale. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which develops Eliquis, trades at about eight times this year's adjusted profit forecast. Merck &amp; Co., which develops Keytruda and is rolling out a new Covid-19 antiviral treatment, trades at about 16 times. Both companies will likely grow sales by at least 10% in 2021.</p><p>Those prices are cheap even if the Democrats' deal becomes law. And should drug-pricing overhaul fall short once again in the Senate, investors will have even more occasion to fill up at the pharmacy.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
