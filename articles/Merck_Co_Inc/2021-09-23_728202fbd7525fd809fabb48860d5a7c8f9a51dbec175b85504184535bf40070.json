  "text": "<p>What sorts of drug-related innovations do you think will come out of the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Recent developments in the U.S. vaccination effort bode well for a continued return to normal life. Pfizer and BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine was safe in children ages 5 to 11 years in a late-stage study, and a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended the use of booster shots in older and high-risk adults last week. Broader vaccination coverage is likely on the way.</p><p>Still, hopes to eradicate the disease altogether are currently unrealistic, as a significant share of the population seems unwilling to take a vaccine under any circumstances. Besides, vaccinated patients can still contract the disease, albeit with a greatly reduced risk of hospitalization or death. What is more, the return of large gatherings means some virus spread is inevitable.</p><p>Those realities mean that antiviral medications are still badly needed. Gilead Sciences' drug remdesivir is only approved for patients who are already hospitalized and is given intravenously.</p><p>The picture could change soon. Pfizer, Merck &amp; Co. and Roche Holding are all conducting late-stage clinical trials for experimental oral antiviral treatments, with results expected by the end of the year. Pfizer is evaluating its candidate in high-risk and low-risk patients who haven't yet been hospitalized, while a separate Merck trial with its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics aims to prevent Covid-19 infections in members of the same household as a patient diagnosed with the disease, with results likely in 2022. Roche, in partnership with Atea Pharmaceuticals, is studying its drug in hospitalized patients.</p><p>These medications, should they prove effective, would help slow the spread of Covid and help patients recover more quickly. They also have the potential to be a major commercial success. After all, remdesivir sales totaled $829 million in the second quarter this year and have eclipsed $5 billion since the pandemic began. Drugs that work for patients who don't require hospitalization, or for close contacts of positive cases, could be even more lucrative.</p><p>Granted, there are obstacles even for effective antivirals; these drugs often require a prompt diagnosis to be useful. And from a financial perspective, these drug companies already have large top lines; Pfizer, Merck and Roche combined for about $150 billion in revenue last year.</p><p>Still, fresh growth opportunities for large drugmakers are typically in short supply. The substantial Covid-19 testing apparatus makes a prompt diagnosis and effective use of such medication more realistic than a typical flu case. And governments around the world would likely be willing to buy a lot of medication to help prevent the severe economic consequences that Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown policies have caused, like shuttered schools and businesses.</p><p>Investors should be willing to swallow this pill without much hesitation.</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Big Pharma Isn't Done Rolling Out Covid Treatments</p>",
