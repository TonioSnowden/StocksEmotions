  "title": "New Omicron Subvariant Prompts FDA Limits on Use of GlaxoSmithKline's Antibody Drug; FDA said doctors shouldn't use sotrovimab in New York, Massachusetts, other states where BA.2 subvariant is dominant",
  "text": "<p>Recent testing indicated that the therapy probably wouldn't work against the BA.2 subvariant, Vir and Glaxo said.</p><p>The FDA said doctors could instead give Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid, Gilead Sciences Inc.'s Veklury, Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s bebtelovimab, and molnupiravir, from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, to people with mild or moderate Covid-19 who are at high risk of severe disease.</p><p>Vir and Glaxo developed sotrovimab with the hope that it would work against all coronavirus variants, including new ones that emerge over time. The antibody targets a part of the virus that tends to remain even as the virus mutates, the companies have said.</p><p>Sotrovimab was one of the few antibody treatments that had worked against the earlier version of the Omicron variant that struck the U.S. at the end of last year and early this one, and many doctors and patients sought it out during the recent surge.</p><p>In January, the FDA restricted use of older antibody drugs from Lilly and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. because tests found they lost potency against the initial Omicron subvariant that hit the U.S.</p><p>Sotrovimab, initially cleared for use last year, was permitted for adults and children 12 years and older with mild to moderate Covid-19 and at high risk of developing severe disease. Glaxo and Vir had been racing to increase manufacturing, given the limited options of antibody treatments.</p><p>The companies said Friday that they plan to provide regulators with data showing that a higher dose of sotrovimab than currently authorized could be used against the BA.2 subvariant.</p><p>The FDA said it would keep monitoring the BA.2 variant's prevalence around the U.S. and may need to further restrict where sotrovimab can be used.</p><p>The FDA cleared for use in February Lilly's bebtelovimab, which was found to work against Omicron, for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in nonhospitalized people 12 and older who are at high risk of getting severely sick.</p><p>As of March 19, the BA.2 subvariant accounts for more than half the casesin much of the Northeast, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, according to the CDC.</p><p>The other states where BA.2 is dominant and sotrovimab's use was restricted, the FDA said, are Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Jersey.</p><p>Joseph Walker contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
