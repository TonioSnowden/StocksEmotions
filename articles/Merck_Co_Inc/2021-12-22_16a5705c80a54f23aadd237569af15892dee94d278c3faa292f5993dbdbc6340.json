  "text": "<p>The White House has warned it will take more than six months to fulfil its initial order for Pfizer's antiviral Covid-19 pill, as officials damped speculation the drug could immediately turn the tables on the pandemic.</p> <p>The US drugs regulator on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe6308a-e26b-40a5-ae7b-75939b232b93\">gave emergency authorisation</a> for the pill, called Paxlovid, to be used on people aged 12 and over with mild or moderate Covid-19 who are at risk of more severe symptoms. </p> <p>But senior health advisers to President Joe Biden quickly warned that it would take months for the company to make and distribute all 10m treatment courses already on order.</p> <p>Jeff Zients, the co-ordinator of Biden's Covid-19 response team, said: “According to Pfizer, the complex chemistry involved in creating the active ingredient in the pill means production takes about six to eight months.”</p> <p>He added: “We will have 265,000 treatment courses of Pfizer available in January . . . and all 10m treatment courses delivered by late summer.”</p> <p>Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16796f92-5845-4b83-8e96-39d5c2fd13ea\">has said</a> its pill cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death in Covid-19 patients by 89 per cent. It is likely to be especially important in the coming months because early lab tests show it continues to work against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, unlike some of the monoclonal antibody treatments already available.</p> <p>Biden called the decision by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday to authorise the pill a “significant step forward in our path out of the pandemic”. </p> <p>But he also acknowledged how difficult the drug is to make, adding: “As Pfizer works to produce these treatments as quickly as possible, we will work closely with them and provide any resource needed, including using the Defense Production Act if warranted.”</p> <p>Both Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump have used the Korean war-era DPA to force companies to prioritise manufacturing of certain supplies that are important to fight Covid-19.</p> <p>The government has also pre-ordered 3m courses of Merck's antiviral pill, which is still going through the FDA approval process. </p> <p>France on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35457402-2b42-4a9b-9a78-63495126e7d2\">cancelled its order</a> of the drug after data showed it resulted in a reduction of only 30 per cent in the risk of hospitalisation and death, significantly lower than earlier expectations.</p> <p>US officials said on Wednesday the FDA would continue to consider Merck's approval application.</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2021 'White House warns Pfizer Covid-19 pill will not be widely available for months' FT.com 22 December.
