  "title": "Low Interactions Risk Fuels Demand for Merck Covid Pill",
  "text": "<p>The high demand for Lagevrio, also known as molnupiravir, in certain places reflects a preference for a low risk of potential drug interactions over keeping more people out of the hospital, despite criticism of the drug from doctors and authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>\"Molnupiravir is a lot easier because it's got a couple of minor restrictions, but it's actually much, much, much less risk for contraindications,\" said Australian Medical Association Vice President Dr. Chris Moy.</p><p>Should Lagevrio's use be sustained in these handful of countries, it could potentially spur supply agreements and boost sales for the drug.</p><p>Analysts' forecasts have been scaled back as Paxlovid's preference has grown. Lagevrio sales are forecast this year to reach $5.4 billion, compared with $24.8 billion of Paxlovid, according to analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Separate studies of unvaccinated, high-risk adults found Pfizer's drug to be 88% effective at preventing hospitalization, compared with 30% by the Merck-Ridgeback drug.</p><p>In large part due to the higher efficacy, Pfizer's Paxlovid remains the world's Covid-19 pill of choice. Countries -- mostly rich ones -- have secured more than 29 million courses of Paxlovid, compared with at least 12 million courses of Lagevrio, according to Duke University's Global Health Innovation Center.</p><p>Prescribing behavior could change given the limited time doctors have had with the pills, and the virus is forecast by experts to stick around for years.</p><p>Many countries advise against Paxlovid treatment in patients taking certain other drugs, because it includes a component that can interact with other drugs in dangerous and life-threatening ways.</p><p>Lagevrio became available for most people in Italy, Australia and Japan earlier than Paxlovid.</p><p>Unlike the U.S., these countries aren't recommending doctors reserve Lagevrio as a last-resort medicine or requiring certain patients to take contraception due to its reproductive risks, which likely played a role in prescribing, according to governments and health officials.</p><p>Lagevrio may be important in countries trying to quickly treat vulnerable populations taking multiple therapies like the elderly, because it can be prescribed without having to check a patient's liver or kidney functions, said Dean Li, who leads research and development for Merck.</p><p>Pfizer says physicians and pharmacists have experience navigating drug interactions and ones involving Paxlovid are generally manageable. It also says it is working with physicians to better understand the drug's use and manage potential drug interactions.</p><p>In Australia, about 48,600 Lagevrio prescriptions have been filled since it became available on the government's discounted program in March, compared with about 6,800 Paxlovid prescriptions, which became available two months later, according to data from the Australian government program that is one of the main ways of accessing the medications. About 4,000 Lagevrio prescriptions are written weekly, compared with 1,000 for Paxlovid.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
