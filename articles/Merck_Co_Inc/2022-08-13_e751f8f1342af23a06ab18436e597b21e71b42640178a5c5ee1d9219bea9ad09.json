  "text": "<p>One way to do that is to focus on the health-care sector. This is generally considered a defensive group of stocks — after all, the population is aging, innovation creates new treatments and medical attention is not an option for most people. A screen of health-care-sector stocks in the S&amp;P 500 SPX is below.</p><p>On Aug. 8, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence published results of a survey of money managers who oversee about $845 billion of investors' money. This group of about 100 institutional investors remains \"risk averse,\" according to S&amp;P Global, which went so far as to say that its Global Investment Manager Index indicated \"overall sentiment\" had it its lowest point in the survey's history.</p><p>Here's how the surveyed managers felt about the 11 stock sectors:</p><p>Health care is institutional investors' favorite sector, and it is the fourth-best performer this year among the 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500.

If the FCF yield is above the current dividend yield, a company appears to have \"headroom\" to increase the payout or use the extra generated free cash for other activities that might benefit shareholders, such as stock buybacks, expansion or acquisitions.</p><p>Among the 64 companies in the S&amp;P 500 health-care sector, 40 pay dividends. Among those 40 companies, consensus free cash flow estimates among analysts polled by FactSet are available for 28.
