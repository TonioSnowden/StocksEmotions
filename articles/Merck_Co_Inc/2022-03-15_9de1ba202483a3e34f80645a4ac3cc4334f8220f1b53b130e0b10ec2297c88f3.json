  "title": "U.S. News: Merck Pill Gets Wide Use Despite Doctors' Concerns",
  "text": "<p>Prescriptions for the two antivirals have been running about equal since their authorization in December, however. The larger-than-expected use is a sign of the high demand for easy-to-use coronavirus treatments that can be taken at home, especially during surges like the recent Omicron wave.</p><p>More than 74,700 prescriptions for the Merck-Ridgeback pill were filled through Feb. 25, according to drug-data firm Iqvia Holdings Inc. There were more than 79,150 prescriptions filled for Paxlovid.</p><p>Doctors said they turned to molnupiravir, especially during the recent Omicron surge, often because Paxlovid supplies were limited and some antibody drugs didn't work against the new variant. In addition, some patients couldn't take Paxlovid because of the potential harm from mixing it with other medicines.</p><p>\"In a lot of our markets, the thing that we can actually get our hands on is molnupiravir,\" said Ali Khan, chief medical officer of value-based strategy at Oak Street Health Inc., which has about 100 primary-care clinics in 20 states across the U.S.</p><p>Use of Covid-19 pills has dropped since the Omicron wave receded. Yet health authorities are trying to make them easy to access should cases rise again.</p><p>Under a federal program called test and treat, some retail pharmacies will receive the pills directly from the U.S. government rather than states, and take steps to write prescriptions for people who come in and test positive to give them the pills right away.</p><p>Health authorities had looked forward to the advent of Covid-19 pills. People who are newly infected and at high risk of severe disease can more easily take the pills than antibody drugs, which usually require an infusion at a hospital or clinic.</p><p>Yet molnupiravir was only 30% effective in its pivotal study, well below the rates for Paxlovid or antibody therapies. Some doctors have also raised safety concerns over how the drug stops the virus by introducing errors into its genetic code.</p><p>Among the concerns: Lab testing, though not the clinical trials, suggested molnupiravir could cause birth defects. Also, there are some signs the drug's use in study subjects led to a higher frequency of mutations in the virus, which could result in variants.</p><p>\"I don't think it should be used at all,\" said James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., who as a member of an expert panel advising the Food and Drug Administration voted against authorization of molnupiravir.</p><p>All of the mutations seen in molnupiravir-treated trial subjects were in variants already circulating, and the risk of the drug leading to new variants is a hypothetical concern, said Daria Hazuda, vice president of infectious disease discovery at Merck.</p><p>\"The best way to stop evolution is to stop the virus from replicating and stop the virus from being transmitted from individual to individual,\" she said.</p><p>The FDA, National Institutes of Health and Infectious Diseases Society of America have recommended using other treatments if possible.</p><p>By early February, Merck had delivered all 3.1 million courses it owed to the U.S. government under a $2.2 billion agreement. So far, the U.S. government has allocated more than 688,000 Paxlovid courses to states, compared with more than two million courses of molnupiravir.</p><p>Raghavendra Tirupathi, medical director of Keystone Infectious Diseases and the Keystone Health HIV program in Chambersburg, Pa., said he prescribed the Merck drug to a vaccinated man in his 70s who takes heart medications that were risky to interact with Paxlovid. The man was also unable to go to the hospital for antibody treatment.</p><p>\"This man was the perfect prototype for molnupiravir,\" Dr. Tirupathi said. \"He did pretty well, and did not end up in the hospital.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
