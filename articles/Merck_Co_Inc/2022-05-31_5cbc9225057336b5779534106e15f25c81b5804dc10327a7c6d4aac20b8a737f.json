  "text": "<p>If you develop a case of Covid-19, however, here's what public-health and infectious-disease experts say about treatment:</p><p>What should I do if I contract Covid-19? How can I treat mild symptoms from home?</p><p>The first step, doctors say, is to monitor symptoms to determine whether your infection is low or high risk for developing severe disease.</p><p>Individuals who are typically considered to be at low risk for severe disease include people who are young and healthy. They should stay at home away from others, drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and take over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fevers, according to physicians and the CDC.</p><p>People who are young, otherwise healthy and at low risk of developing severe disease generally fully recover, especially if they take the right steps, doctors say.</p><p>People who are at high risk include those with underlying health conditions and the elderly, according to doctors. These individuals should pay close attention to any change in their health, including symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue or difficulty breathing. If high-risk individuals need medical attention, they should seek it right away.</p><p>What do I do if I'm at high risk of severe Covid-19?</p><p>At the top of the list of treatments recommended by the National Institutes of Health is an antiviral pill called Paxlovid.</p><p>The drug, from Pfizer Inc., is for people who are newly infected and have mild to moderate symptoms, but who are at high risk of developing severe disease and becoming hospitalized.</p><p>Such people have several other options if Paxlovid isn't available or they shouldn't take it for some reason, like it could interact harmfully with another medicine the person takes.</p><p>Among the alternatives is the antiviral Veklury from Gilead Sciences Inc. It is given via infusion and is fully approved as a treatment of adults who aren't hospitalized with Covid-19 but are sick and at risk of severe disease. It has also been cleared as a treatment for children under 12 years who have mild to moderate Covid and are at risk for developing severe disease.</p><p>The last two options are bebtelovimab, an antibody treatment from Eli Lilly &amp; Co., and Lagevrio, an antiviral pill from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.</p><p>People who are vaccinated and become infected—what is known as a breakthrough case—are unlikely to develop severe disease or need hospitalization, according to doctors and studies.</p><p>What are Covid-19 antiviral pills?</p><p>Antivirals are treatments designed to impede a virus's replication cycle, allowing people to recover from the illness, and they are most effective if they are taken by patients early in the course of disease.</p><p>They are different than antibodies, which are essentially clones of naturally occurring immune-system antibodies that can fight off the coronavirus and are usually infused.</p><p>Pfizer's Paxlovid and Lagevrio, from Merck and its partner Ridgeback, are the antiviral pills authorized by the FDA.</p><p>Both treatments are taken over five days, with Pfizer's totaling 30 pills and Merck-Ridgeback's clocking in at 40 capsules.</p><p>Paxlovid was 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization in deaths in adults who are newly infected and at high risk of severe Covid-19, Pfizer said its late-stage study found. Merck and Ridgeback said Lagevrio, also known as molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by about 30%.</p><p>The pills carry some safety risks and limitations. A component of Pfizer's Paxlovid regimen, ritonavir, can interact with other drugs in dangerous or life-threatening ways. Drugs that interact with Paxlovid include common ones such as the cholesterol-lowering pill simvastatin, the antipsychotic lurasidone and the sedative triazolam.</p><p>Patients should make sure to tell their doctor or pharmacist of any medications they take before starting on Paxlovid, according to physicians.</p><p>The Merck-Ridgeback drug isn't authorized for children because of its potential effect on bone and cartilage growth. It isn't recommended for pregnant women because of the potential for fetal harm, a safety signal seen in animal studies of the drug. </p><p>Merck and partner Ridgeback say their oral antiviral, molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by about 30%.

Once you have a prescription from your doctor, you can pick them up like any prescribed drug at a pharmacy.</p><p>The federal government has created online tools for people to locate where they can get the pills.</p><p>The government also set up a program at certain retail pharmacies where people can get tested for Covid-19 and if they test positive, receive a prescription for the antivirals at the same location immediately.</p><p>Why are some people treated with Paxlovid then getting Covid-19?</p><p>Some people who appeared to recover from Covid-19 after taking Paxlovid have tested positive or developed symptoms again soon after, according to patients, physicians and researchers. Within two weeks of appearing to get better, some users experienced cold-like symptoms such as sore throat and cough.</p><p>Health experts aren't sure what causes the so-called rebounds. Among the theories are that patients may be taking Paxlovid too early or not long enough. The experts also don't know how common the rebounds are, though Pfizer said its real-world data indicates the relapses occur in fewer than 1 in 3,000 patients.</p><p>Relapsing may be part of the natural history of an infection in some people, regardless of whether they received Paxlovid or were vaccinated, according to the CDC.</p><p>There aren't reports of people who rebound developing severe disease, the CDC says. Nor is there evidence that people who rebound should receive additional courses of Paxlovid or other treatments.</p><p>People who experience Covid-19 rebounds should isolate again for five days at the time the symptoms return or test positive for Covid-19 again, the CDC says. The people can end re-isolation after five days if they have no fever for one day without the use of any medication and symptoms are improving. The people should also wear a mask for 10 days after rebounding.</p><p>Are antiviral pills effective against the Omicron variant?</p><p>The manufacturers of the pills say they are effective.</p><p>Trials for both the Merck and Pfizer and Merck-Ridgeback drugs occurred prior to the arrival of the Omicron variant. The companies say, however, that laboratory testing has found the drugs work against the original version of Omicron known as BA.1.</p><p>Do the antiviral pills work against the Omicron subvariant BA.2?</p><p>Independent researchers have found they do.</p><p>Both Paxlovid's main component and Lagevrio were found effective against BA.2 in, for instance, research published in Marchin the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers in Japan and the U.S. performed the testing.</p><p>The drugmakers don't have conclusive results to date. Pfizer says its drug has consistently been found to be effective against current variants. Lagevrio should be effective against BA.2 given its previous activity against Omicron and other variants, said David Ho, director of the Columbia University Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, whose lab is working with Merck.</p><p>What are antibody drugs?</p><p>Monoclonal antibody treatments are lab-engineered molecules that mimic the natural antibodies produced by the immune system to fight off viruses.</p><p>The therapies are authorized for people who develop symptoms and are considered to be at high risk of severe disease. The drugs are usually administered by infusion or injection at hospitals or clinics, though they may be available for administration at home or through mobile clinics in some parts of the U.S.</p><p>Some states are also allowing low-risk patients to receive monoclonal antibodies, but that isn't recommended by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>As many as 75% of U.S. adults are eligible to take the drugs under FDA guidelines, according to experts.</p><p>Among the antibody drugs are Lilly's bebtelovimab and Evusheld, from AstraZeneca PLC.</p><p>Evusheld is primarily for people 12 years and older who aren't well protected by vaccines because they have weakened immune systems. The immunocompromised take Evusheld before they are infected, such as after they are exposed to someone with Covid-19, to prevent their own case from developing.</p><p>Are the antibody drugs effective against Omicron?</p><p>What's available works against Omicron, health authorities, companies and researchers say.</p><p>After Omicron emerged, the FDA restricted use of certain antibody treatments because they didn't work well against the original form of the Omicron variant. The agency later restricted use of the sotrovimab antibody drug from GlaxoSmithKline PLC and partner Vir Biotechnology because tests found it didn't work well against the BA.2 version of Omicron.</p><p>Lilly's bebtelovimab, however, was found to be effective against Omicron. The FDA authorized bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in nonhospitalized individuals 12 years and older who are at high risk of getting severely sick.</p><p>My loved one is hospitalized. Are there any FDA-approved treatments for hospitalized Covid-19 patients?</p><p>There are several. Among them is the antiviral Veklury, which also goes by the name remdesivir. It is fully approved for treatment of people who are hospitalized with Covid-19.</p><p>Patients who may be at risk of advancing to severe disease may also be given dexamethasone, a steroid first approved in the 1950s that is successful at treating inflammation. The steroid has been found in studies of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to reduce the risk of death. It is recommended for treatment by the NIH and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA.</p><p>Other drugs targeting an overactive immune response have also been found to help hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Those who don't respond to dexamethasone may be given an immune-suppressing rheumatoid arthritis drug called Olumiant. The FDA authorized Olumiant after a study showed it helped hospitalized patients recover more quickly.</p><p>A similar rheumatoid arthritis drug, Actemra, made by Roche Holding AG, is also used to tamp down the potentially lethal inflammation seen in some hospitalized patients.</p><p>Doctors sometimes administer blood-thinners to hospitalized patients, which can reduce blood clots and inflammation that develop in some Covid-19 patients. Some studies have found that such treatments can also reduce the risk of patients needing mechanical ventilation and could help them leave the hospital sooner.</p><p>Is ivermectin effective in treating Covid-19?</p><p>Most research has found ivermectin doesn't work against Covid-19, and federal health regulators have warned doctors and veterinarians against the unauthorized use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19.</p><p>In the latest trial, researchers found ivermectin didn't reduce hospital admissions. Nearly 1,400 Covid-19 patients at risk of severe disease were involved in the trial, making it the largest to date showing that those who received ivermectin as a treatment didn't fare better than those who received a placebo.</p><p>Most previous research also hasn't shownthat ivermectin is an effective Covid-19 treatment.</p><p>Ivermectin hasn't been cleared to treat Covid-19 or viruses. The FDA approved ivermectin to treat some parasitic worms, as well as a topical treatment for head lice and skin conditions such as rosacea. It is also used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals.</p><p>Can my doctor treat me with hydroxychloroquine?</p><p>Most doctors recommend against it. The FDA initially authorized hydroxychloroquine—and another antimalaria medicine called chloroquine—but later revoked the clearances after concluding the therapies were unlikely to help fight the disease.</p><p>Many studies back up the FDA's view. The studies have found that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine don't reduce the severity of Covid-19 symptoms or provide a benefit to patients.</p><p>The pair of drugs were approved decades ago to treat and prevent malaria and are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors can prescribe drugs for uses that the FDA hasn't authorized. But the NIH recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the hospitalized or nonhospitalized, as does the IDSA, which also recommends against it as a prophylactic.</p><p>I'm vaccinated but I contracted Covid-19. Can I use any of the approved treatments?</p><p>While it is unlikely that vaccinated people will end up in the hospital, doctors say, those who do will likely be eligible for similar treatments as the unvaccinated.</p><p>\"Once you get hospitalized in breakthrough cases you will get all the usual therapies,\" said Dr. Abhijit Duggal, a staff ICU physician and director for critical care research for the medical ICU at the Cleveland Clinic. \"Anything that we do after that is really trying to minimize the damage associated with the viral infection.\"</p><p>Factors that affect treatment of vaccinated people, he said, include whether someone has any underlying immunity or any other health conditions, which are called comorbidities.</p><p>Dr. Duggal said giving antibody treatments to the vaccinated who have Covid-19 isn't standard and may not be appropriate since the virus infected the patient despite the presence of antibodies from the vaccines.</p><p>What if I am immunocompromised and become infected?</p><p>Most of the hospitalized patients who were previously vaccinated have weakened immune systems, according to doctors. These immunocompromised people include some cancer survivors and people living with HIV.</p><p>Hospitalized patients who are immunocompromised are eligible to receive convalescent plasma, a highly concentrated solution of antibodies taken from recovered Covid-19 patients. There is limited data that suggests monoclonal antibody treatments will benefit the immunocompromised, even if they are vaccinated, Dr. Duggal said.</p><p>​—Peter Loftus and Joseph Walker contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
