  "title": "German Blue-Chip Index Adds New Companies as It Tightens Rules; The changes to DAX were triggered by the scandal around Wirecard, which last year disclosed a $2 billion accounting hole",
  "text": "<p>The DAX index, which represents around $1.2 trillion in market value, will be expanded to include a wider scope of companies, including more pharmaceutical and retail firms. Deutsche Börse tweaked its admission criteria by opting for market capitalization only as opposed to market cap and trading volume before the overhaul.</p><p>New entrants also have to hold a minimum liquidity of €1 billion, equivalent to $1.19 billion, or 20% of their annual market cap.</p><p>Deutsche Börse on Friday said that Airbus SE, Brenntag SE, HelloFresh SE, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Puma SE, Qiagen NV, Sartorius AG Vz, Siemens Healthineers AG, Symrise AG and Zalando SE would join the DAX.</p><p>Trading with the new lineup will begin Sept. 20.</p><p>Under the new rules, which were first announced in November, candidates for the DAX have to report positive operating profit—or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—for two full years before joining the index, its owner Qontigo, the unit of Deutsche Börse that runs indexes and financial data, said.</p><p>That makes the German index more aligned with its international peers, for example in the U.S., where potential members of the S&amp;P 500 have to post four consecutive quarters of accumulated profits.</p><p>Deutsche Börse also clarified the time frames during which companies have to file their financial reports, allowing the index operator to expel firms that fail to submit their statements on time.</p><p>While some of the changes took effect in December, others became effective in March. Certain requirements apply from this month.</p><p>DAX companies have to declare that they have an audit committee, which follows recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The code states that the committee must be headed by an independent director who isn't also the chairman of the supervisory board.</p><p>Deutsche Börse decided against adding criteria related to companies' environmental, social or governance performance due to little support from market participants, it said.</p><p>Adding new members could bring some dilution for the existing companies represented in the index. \"If in the future the available funds are distributed among 40 instead of 30 companies, then corresponding reallocations will be necessary,\" said Helen Giza, chief financial officer of Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA, a medical firm that is already in the DAX. The company, whose shares have depreciated about 5% since the beginning of the year, doesn't expect noticeable price fluctuations though, Ms. Giza said. Fresenius Medical Care's shares closed at €65.16 on Friday, down 0.58%.</p><p>Finance chiefs of companies in the index generally welcomed the changes. \"In our view, the DAX 40 better reflects the German company landscape, which is good for investors,\" said Marcus Kuhnert, CFO of science and technology company Merck KGaA.</p><p>The increased focus on transparency and quality of earnings benefits the reputation of the index and that of its members, according to Marc Spieker, CFO of energy firm E.ON SE. More alignment with international standards could improve the DAX's visibility, said Thomas Toepfer, finance chief at German specialty chemicals company Covestro AG.</p><p>Deutsche Börse last August made it easier to remove constituents from the index after Wirecard languished in the index for more than a month after filing for the German equivalent of bankruptcy. \"Wirecard wasn't the reason, but the trigger\" for the overhaul, said Stephan Flägel, Chief Product Officer at Qontigo.</p><p>Under the new rules, bankrupt or insolvent companies can be removed from the index within days, said Alexander Foltin, head of finance, treasury and investor relations at semiconductor company Infineon Technologies AG. New requirements for minimum liquidity, profitability and a higher frequency of inspections also should bring improvements to the index, Mr. Foltin said.</p><p>\"It should go without saying that Germany's most important index not only includes the largest and most important companies, but also takes into account their profitability and thus the future viability of their business model,\" said Ralf Thomas, CFO of technology firm Siemens AG.</p><p>Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>German Blue-Chip Index Adds New Companies as It Tightens Rules</p>",
