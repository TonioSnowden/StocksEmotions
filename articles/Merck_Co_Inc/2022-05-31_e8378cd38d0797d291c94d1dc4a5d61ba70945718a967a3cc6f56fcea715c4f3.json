  "text": "<p>   The Covid-19 treatment from Pfizer Inc. has become the leading pandemic pill prescribed in the U.S., as supplies have improved and its availability at pharmacies widened. </p><p>   Pfizer's antiviral drug, called Paxlovid, totaled more than 412,000 prescriptions through May 6, compared with about 110,000 prescriptions of molnupiravir, an antiviral from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, according to drug-data firm Iqvia Holdings Inc. </p><p>   Both pills were cleared for use in high-risk individuals early in the course of their disease in December by the Food and Drug Administration, to keep people from becoming hospitalized. </p><p>   While separate clinical trials showed Pfizer's drug to be 88% effective at preventing hospitalization, compared with 30% by the Merck-Ridgeback drug, supply of Paxlovid was scarce at the beginning. But supply and availability of Paxlovid have since increased, as Pfizer ramped up manufacturing. </p><p>   The Biden administration also launched and expanded a test-to-treat program in which patients who test positive at retail pharmacies immediately receive their antiviral prescription. On Thursday, the administration said it would send clinical personnel to help turn several of Minnesota's state-run testing sites into locations that would also provide Paxlovid and molnupiravir, which is marketed as Lagevrio. </p><p>   The increase in supply and availability has accelerated use of Paxlovid, doctors and pharmacists say, as has its recommendation by health authorities ahead of other treatments. Physicians also say they are getting more comfortable prescribing Paxlovid, which could interact dangerously with some common medications. </p><p>   Prescriptions for the antivirals ran about even until March, in part because the limited number of Paxlovid pills resulted in doctors relying on Lagevrio. Additionally, some patients couldn't take Paxlovid due to the potential harm from mixing it with other medicines they take. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Stephanie Armour contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
