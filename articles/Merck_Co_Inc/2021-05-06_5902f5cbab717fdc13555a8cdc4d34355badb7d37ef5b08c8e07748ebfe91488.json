  "title": "'Stakeholder Capitalism' Caused the Oxford Vaccine Debacle",
  "text": "<p>Only a year ago the vaccine, developed first by Oxford researchers, was a global front-runner. It showed impressive safety and efficacy (85% among seniors) in trials and was celebrated as the lowest-cost Western vaccine. But it has been beset by embarrassing blunders, poor communication, chaotic trials, major manufacturing hiccups, and, more recently, a tiny number of blood-clot incidents. The shot has yet to be authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and may never be deployed in America. Some of the tens of millions of doses sitting unused in U.S. warehouses have been earmarked as aid to other countries.</p><p>The cascade of errors relates closely to Oxford scientists' trendy denunciations of profit. Researchers from the school's Jenner Institute planned at first to shun \"Big Pharma\" involvement. They wanted to produce the vaccine themselves or license it at cost on a nonexclusive basis to any interested company. University leaders quickly realized that a few dozen staff without commercial experience wouldn't be able to manufacture and distribute a shot to billions globally.</p><p>Oxford came close to securing a deal with Merck &amp; Co., the world's second-biggest vaccine producer, with some $40 billion in annual pharmaceutical sales. Merck had been collaborating with the Jenner Institute since 2018 and has been involved in earlier adenovirus vaccine research in the 2000s. As late as mid-April 2020, Merck was announcing the acceleration of a large-scale manufacturing platform to produce the Oxford vaccine.</p><p>Discussions fell apart two weeks later. The Oxford scientists were unhappy with the level of global access Merck were willing to provide, and they demanded Merck provide that access without profit. The scientists demanded that their pharmaceutical partner take on substantial reputational and financial risk without the prospect of reward. This kerfuffle delayed vaccine development by crucial weeks. The U.K. government also had concerns about relying on New Jersey-based Merck, given the possibility of U.S. export bans. Britain insisted on priority for vaccine access.</p><p>The Oxford scientists dropped Merck and instead signed a deal with British-Swedish AstraZeneca, which committed to provide the vaccine at cost for the duration of the pandemic and in perpetuity to low- and middle-income countries. AstraZeneca is a world-renowned drugmaker, but it had no experience with vaccine development except for a little-known nasal-spray vaccine for the flu. This was the firm's chance to boost its reputation for cutting-edge science.</p><p>Instead, inexperience has been on international display as AstraZeneca and the scientists made several amateurish mistakes. The vaccine's initial trial included only about 12,000 participants -- compared with roughly 40,000 for Pfizer and 30,000 for Moderna. AstraZeneca's cohort had too few patients over 65 to reach a statistically significant result about the vaccine's efficacy for that age group. This delayed government approval and led some overcautious European regulators to advise against giving the vaccine to seniors for several months.</p><p>The company also mixed up dosages in its trials, was slow to provide data to regulators, and miscommunicated results by combining different cohorts. Most recently, AstraZeneca was criticized by U.S. regulators for releasing vaccine data about U.S. trial results that were outdated and \"potentially misleading,\" in the words of an oversight board appointed by the National Institutes of Health. There have also been manufacturing issues across plants subcontracted to produce the vaccine. The unforced errors soured the vaccine's reputation among regulators and the public.</p><p>It has become fashionable to reject the pursuit by corporations of profit in favor of serving \"stakeholders\" and pursuing altruistic goals. The Oxford vaccine debacle reveals how this approach goes terribly awry. Profit, as Adam Smith explained, channels human self-interest into serving others. It gives firms an incentive to provide people what they want. Without it, or when other goals take priority, businesses inevitably fail to deliver for their customers, employees and society.</p><p>If there was ever a justification for a large profit, it would be creating a vaccine that ended a crushing global pandemic. Ultimately, prices will come down as manufacturing is streamlined and more entrants provide competitive pressure. But it's worth paying a lot to obtain as many vaccines as quickly as possible.</p><p>Profit, along with an agreement to work with the more experienced Merck, could have reduced mistakes and increased production of the Oxford vaccine. And it has crept in despite the university scientists' professed ideals. They will receive a gigantic payday from their spinout company, Vaccitech, when vaccine boosters and updates are eventually sold for profit in developed countries after the pandemic. AstraZeneca has so far lost money on the project. But now, as Covid-19 rages across poorer, unvaccinated countries, a little more profit could have saved lives.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lesh is head of research at London's Adam Smith Institute.</p>",
