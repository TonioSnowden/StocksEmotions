  "title": "Moderna Cuts Outlook Amid Covid-Vaccine Supply Hurdles; Pharmaceutical company says sales could be up to $3 billion lower this year than initially expected",
  "text": "<p>Moderna Inc.'s third-quarter revenue fell by nearly a third and the pharmaceutical company cut its outlook, saying as part of its earnings report that supply constraints for its Covid-19 vaccines might sap as much as $3 billion in sales this year.</p><p>The Cambridge, Mass.-based company said Thursday that higher costs and a decline in demand for its Covid-19 vaccines also hit its performance.</p><p>Moderna, which three months ago said it projected $21 billion in product sales of its Spikevax vaccine for anticipated delivery this year, now expects between $18 billion and $19 billion. The company said short-term supply constraints will delay some sales into 2023.</p><p>The choppy results came during a quarter of transition for Moderna. Demand for its original Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot dropped, while the company rolled out updated booster shots designed to better target Omicron subvariants of the coronavirus.</p><p>U.S. regulators cleared one of the updated boosters in late August, and uptake has been relatively slow. Moderna's new booster shot was in short supply because a contract manufacturer had quality issues that held up the release of doses. At the same time, Moderna shifted to five-dose vials from 10-dose vials for packaging its vaccine.</p><p>\"We actually had to deal with a very complex third quarter from a manufacturing standpoint,\" Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call with analysts. He said the company had \"many lessons to be learned,\" and is working to address the challenges.</p><p>Moderna shares were off 2.5% at $144.89 at midday Thursday.</p><p>For the third quarter, Moderna's product sales declined 35% to $3.1 billion.</p><p>The company's cost of sales was $1.1 billion, representing 35% of total product sales in the quarter, rising from $722 million a year earlier. Costs rose partly because of a $333 million charge to write down inventory for vaccine doses that exceeded or were expected to exceed their approved shelf lives. This year, Moderna and other vaccine makers have had to discard unused doses as demand for the shots fell sharply.</p><p>Moderna also booked expenses for unused manufacturing capacity, and some of its purchase commitments were canceled, the company said.</p><p>Research-and-development expenses at Moderna rose 57% to $820 million, as the company is running several large clinical trials of experimental drugs and vaccines.</p><p>Moderna is developing vaccines against seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV—bugs that are causing hospitalizations in the U.S. Moderna also is developing a combination vaccine designed to protect against Covid, flu and RSV in a single shot.</p><p>The company also is developing a vaccine with potential to treat cancer, and which is being tested in combination with a Merck &amp; Co. cancer drug in a clinical trial of patients with the skin cancer melanoma.</p><p>Results of studies of some of these experimental vaccines are due out in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Overall for the quarter, the company said net income fell to $1 billion, or $2.53 a share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $7.70 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $3.30 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue dropped to $3.4 billion, short of analyst estimates for $3.5 billion.</p><p>Earlier this week, Pfizer Inc. raised its revenue outlook for the year but the company experienced a drop in third-quarter sales of its vaccine to $4.4 billion from nearly $13 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at Peter.Loftus@wsj.com and Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna Cuts Outlook Amid Covid-Vaccine Supply Hurdles</p>",
