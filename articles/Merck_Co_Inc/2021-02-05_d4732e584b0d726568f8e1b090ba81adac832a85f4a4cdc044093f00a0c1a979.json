In December, it stunned investors and disappointed countries who bankrolled the jab when a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7b5da3f-f863-4cf2-bd0d-2694dfe6ae1e\">dosing error</a> in a clinical trial delayed the vaccine's progress by three to six months.&#xa0;</p> <p>The mishap left Sanofi trailing competitors BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccines are being administered to millions globally.</p> <p>“We continue to work in parallel on our two Covid-19 vaccine candidates, with clinical trials starting in the coming weeks,” the company said.</p> <p>Sanofi also on Friday promised an additional €500m in cost cuts to €2.5bn by 2022 and said the savings would be ploughed back into research and development to further its ambitions in immunology and oncology.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hudson's plan for Sanofi has been to scale back in mature markets such as treatments for cardiovascular and diabetes and expand in more attractive areas such as cancer and speciality drugs. The shift will lead to 1,700 job cuts in Europe, mostly in France, prompting some unions to protest in front of its Paris headquarters this week.</p> <p>But investors are waiting to judge whether the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08f1fcf8-1ce4-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">British </a>chief executive, who joined in September 2019 from Novartis, will be able to revamp Sanofi. He has made two <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18cd64a6-48d0-48fa-ba85-8c54373fcd0d\">acquisitions</a> worth about $6bn and has funds for more after Sanofi raised around $12bn by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a7bb2a1-ca8c-4adb-84fb-070e82e576dc\">selling its stake</a> in US biotech Regeneron last year. </p> <p>Asked about Sanofi's deals strategy at an investor conference on Friday, Hudson said the group does not need to make a big acquisition and that share buybacks were not a priority.</p> <p>“We want to create value, we are sticking to the science,” he said. “We do not think we are a company that needs to do a big piece to consolidate extra revenue.”</p> <p>Sanofi shares have declined about 3 per cent since Hudson took over, while shares in rivals Merck and Pfizer are up about 0.6 per cent in the same period. On Friday the stock rose about 2 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent rise for France's blue-chip CAC 40 index. </p> <p>Sanofi confirmed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd45a262-1a6e-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">earlier goals</a> to achieve operating margins of 30 per cent by 2022, up from 27.1 per cent in 2020, and for its top-selling drug, the eczema treatment Dupixent, to achieve more than €10bn in peak sales. </p> <p>Sanofi also expects earnings per share to increase by “high single digits” on a constant currency basis this year driven by growth in Dupixent and vaccines.</p> <p>The company reported EPS of €5.86 for 2020, ahead of analysts' expectations of €5.78 according to Barclays. Annual revenue was €36bn, in line with consensus.</p> <p>The group plans to pay a dividend of €3.20 per share for 2020, up from €3.15 in 2019.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 4.2 per cent to €9.4bn, driven by Dupixent and what Sanofi described as a “record demand” for its influenza vaccines. Doctors had urged people to get flu shots to avoid overwhelming hospitals during the winter months.<br></p><p>Source: Leila Abboud in Paris 2021 'Sanofi to expand cost-savings push to bolster R&amp;D efforts ' FT.com 5 February.
