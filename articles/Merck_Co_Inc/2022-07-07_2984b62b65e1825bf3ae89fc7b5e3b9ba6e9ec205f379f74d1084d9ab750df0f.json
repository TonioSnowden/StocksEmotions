  "text": "<p>Merck &amp; Co. is in advanced talks to acquire Seagen Inc. and is aiming to finalize a purchase of the cancer biotech in the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be worth roughly $40 billion or more.</p><p>The companies are discussing a price for Seagen above $200 a share and are seeking to seal a deal on or before the announcement of Merck's quarterly earnings, set for July 28, the people said. Seagen's stock closed at $175.13 on Wednesday.</p><p>There is still no guarantee the companies will reach agreement on a takeover deal.</p><p>New Jersey-based Merck has a market value of around $235 billion. Acquiring Seagen would help broaden its lineup of cancer drugs, currently led by the blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda, the company's top-selling product with $17.2 billion in sales last year.</p><p>It could also help offset the sales blow expected when Keytruda loses patent protection, which analysts expect at the end of this decade. Keytruda could approach 40% of Merck's sales in 2027, Cowen &amp; Co. analysts estimate.</p><p>Any proposed deal is expected to draw a close look from antitrust officials, with Cowen analysts recently predicting \"a high likelihood\" of litigation from the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Shareholders of both companies have nevertheless reacted positively to the possibility of a tie-up, with both stocks up sharply since The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks in June.</p><p>Seagen helped pioneer a class of cancer therapy that works like a guided missile attacking tumors with toxins. By directing the strike, the therapies, called antibody drug conjugates, can maximize the treatment's benefits while minimizing side effects by not going off target.</p><p>Among Seagen's products is Adcetris, which had $1.4 billion in sales last year. Sales have been rising for Padcev, a drug for urothelial cancers of the bladder and certain other organs first approved in 2019. Seagen sells Padcev with Astellas Pharma Inc.</p><p>The promise of antibody drug conjugates treating various cancers has drawn the interest of big pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>In 2020, Gilead Sciences Inc. paid $21 billion for Immunomedics and its antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy for breast cancer. Merck was among the companies interested in Immunomedics, the Journal has reported.</p><p>Also attractive to drugmakers is the perceived limited risk that rivals could develop and sell lower-cost generic versions of ADCs.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com, Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Jonathan D.
