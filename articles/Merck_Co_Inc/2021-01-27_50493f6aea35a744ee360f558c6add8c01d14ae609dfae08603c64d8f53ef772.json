  "title": "J&J Expects  Vaccine Trial  Results Soon  ---  Strong quarterly sales  of pharmaceuticals  help offset weakness  in medical-device unit  ----  By Peter Loftus and Matt Grossman",
  "text": "<p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson said it expects to report pivotal results of a large clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine by early next week, and to deliver 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June if the data are positive and the vaccine is authorized. </p><p>   The company discussed its vaccine plans Tuesday as it reported improved fourth-quarter sales and higher-than-expected earnings. Strong sales growth from pharmaceuticals boosted revenue as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on other parts of the business. </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson said the pandemic continued to drag down sales of its medical devices as people have postponed elective procedures. Modest growth in consumer-health products also contributed to the latest quarter's sales boost. </p><p>   Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive, said he was optimistic about the imminent results from a 45,000-person clinical trial of J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine. He noted on a call with analysts that results from a smaller, early-stage study were positive. </p><p>   \"We are hopeful that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in a larger population. Of course, until we see this final data, we won't know for certain,\" he said. </p><p>   Emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could follow, which would bolster the nation's vaccine supplies after a rocky rollout. </p><p>   The federal government also has options to purchase additional doses beyond the initial 100 million, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview. </p><p>   One potential advantage with J&amp;J's vaccine is that the company tested it as a single dose. The shot can also be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures, whereas the two vaccines authorized in the U.S. -- one from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE and the other from Moderna Inc. -- are two-dose shots that must be kept frozen, then thawed before being administered. </p><p>   \"We are planning to be part of the solution,\" Mr. Wolk said. \"The fact that we do not require significant refrigeration beyond the norm, as well as being one shot, certainly does play into the label that some outside the company have called it a game-changer.\" </p><p>   Technical challenges and supply constraints have slowed the U.S. vaccine rollout as manufacturers and health officials race to make and distribute the shots across the country. </p><p>   Merck &amp; Co. on Monday said it was discontinuing development of its Covid-19 vaccine after clinical-trial results disappointed. </p><p>   It is possible that J&amp;J's imminent study results would yield clues about how the vaccine performs against new coronavirus variants. Some of the study subjects were in South Africa, where a more contagious strain of the virus has been identified. </p><p>   Moderna said Monday that lab tests showed its vaccine produced a weaker response against the South Africa strain, though the company still believes it will be protective. Moderna has started developing a modified vaccine targeting this strain that could be given as a booster shot. </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson's fourth-quarter revenue was $22.48 billion, compared with $20.75 billion in the year-before quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting revenue of $21.66 billion. </p><p>   Drugs such as Stelara, for inflammatory diseases, and Darzalex, for multiple myeloma, helped drive sales growth of 16% for the New Brunswick, N.J., company's pharmaceutical division, to $12.27 billion. Revenue from the consumer-health division ticked up 1.4% to $3.62 billion. </p><p>   Sales from medical devices slipped 0.7% year over year to $6.59 billion as the pandemic cut demand for products used in surgery, orthopedics and vision care. </p><p>   Net earnings totaled $1.74 billion, or 65 cents a share, compared with $4.01 billion, or $1.50 a share, a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
