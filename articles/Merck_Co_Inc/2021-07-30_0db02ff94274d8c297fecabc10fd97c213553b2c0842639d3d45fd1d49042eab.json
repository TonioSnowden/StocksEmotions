Since end-June, the company has boosted its Covid-19 bed capacity by 57% to 550 for its hospitals and by 60% to 4,000 for its \"hospitels\"--a portmanteau of hospital and hotel--the brokerage notes. Also, the hospital operator is likely able to sustain its high 2021 earnings base into 2023, with key drivers including growth in non-Covid-19 cash patients from managed-care programs and excellence center management, the brokerage adds. Shares are 2.8% lower at THB4.16. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p>0027 GMT - New Zealand retirement-village operator Ryman Healthcare is upgraded to outperform from neutral by Macquarie, which thinks Ryman's positive 1Q update will be a turning point for sentiment toward the stock. The share price had sharp falls in April and May and was flat in June, reflecting views that high debt would constrain growth. \"It appears the worst is behind it,\" Macquarie says. Ryman is \"positioned to deliver material earnings growth,\" it says, though Summerset and Arvida remain the investment bank's preferred New Zealand retirement stocks. Ryman shares are up nearly 6.0% over two sessions at NZ$13.18 versus Macquarie's 12-month target of NZ$14.60. (stephen.wright@wsj.com)</p><p>2104 GMT - A New York bankruptcy judge says Thursday he would approve a retention bonus program worth up to $16M for roughly 500 of Purdue Pharma LP employees the company said are critical to its business. The 2021 retention program is needed to retain employees at Purdue, which is experiencing relatively high attrition as it prepares for an August trial over its chapter 11 exit plan, a lawyer for the company says Thursday during a hearing in the US Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. Purdue has a separate request to pay incentive bonuses to its executives which the bankruptcy court is scheduled to consider next month. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)</p><p>2036 GMT - Gilead beats analysts' top- and bottom-line estimates, with its Covid-19 antiviral Veklury picking up the slack for lower-than-expected HIV drug sales. Veklury sales were $829M in 2Q, 26% higher than the $658M projected by analysts polled by FactSet. The pandemic continued to weigh on other segments of the business, however, with sales of Biktarvy, Gilead's HIV blockbuster, coming in at $1.9B, or 6% lower than analysts had predicted. Gilead shares down 2% after-hours. (joseph.walker@wsj.com)</p><p>1305 GMT - Merck R&amp;D Chief Dean Li says that the late stage study of the company's potential Covid-19 drug molnupiravir in newly infected, high-risk patients should complete in October. \"We are very enthusiastic about how this trial is progressing,\" he said on the company's second quarter earnings call. The pill, which it is developing with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, hit a setback in April when it failed to help hospitalized patients. (jared.hopkins@wsj.com; @jaredshopkins)</p><p>1225 GMT - Merck Chief Executive Rob Davis, who began leading the drugmaker July 1, outlined his vision on the company's second quarter earnings call, saying R&amp;D investment is a priority and Merck will be aggressive in dealmaking. Davis said Merck will look to acquisitions and partnerships to add early to late stage experimental drugs to the company's late pipeline and isn't limited by disease areas or size of deals. Davis also said Merck needs to operate more efficiently and embrace digital technology. \"While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency and agility,\" he said. (jared.hopkins@wsj.com; @jaredshopkins)</p><p>1126 GMT - AstraZeneca PLC , maker of a globally distributed Covid-19 vaccine in partnership with the University of Oxford , isn't requiring staff to have shots, but vaccination uptake has been \"pretty good,\" CEO Pascal Soriot says. \"We are encouraging employees to be vaccinated, but we haven't made it, and we don't intend to make it, compulsory for now.\" The company will remain flexible with managers deciding work-from-home policies, he says. But Soriot is ready for staff to be face-to-face again. \"We do believe that we need to be office-based or lab-based and we need people back in the office.\" (jenny.strasburg@wsj.com)</p><p>0958 GMT - Indivior enjoys a solid position in an industry forced into expansion by a raging opioid crisis, according to Numis Securities . With the opioid crisis accelerating in the U.S. and worldwide and being exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the pharmaceutical company remains a key part of the fight against opioid addiction, Numis says. Meanwhile, lower costs allowed for a better first-half profitability, the brokerage says. Numis has a buy rating on the stock and a target price of 320.0 pence. Shares are up 3.6% at 153.6 pence. (matteo.castia@dowjones.com)</p><p>0941 GMT - AstraZeneca 's 2021 outlook was broadly as expected and implies around $0.30 to $0.40 earnings-per-share accretion from the July 21 closing of the Alexion acquisition, Jefferies says. This should calm some nerves and prompt a modest share rise, according to the investment bank. The Anglo-Swedish pharma major also posted sales which were above consensus on the back of key growth drivers such as diabetes drug Farxiga, lung-cancer medicine Tagrisso and lymphoma treatment Calquence, Jefferies says. Earnings per share, however, came in shy of consensus as did gross margin, which was largely due to no-profit supply of the Covid-19 vaccine, Jefferies says. AstraZeneca trades up 0.2% at 8279.00 pence. (cecilia.butini@wsj.com)</p><p>0904 GMT - AstraZeneca shares edge 0.2% higher as the drug group raised its core earnings-per-share guidance for 2021 after completing its acquisition of U.S. drug group Alexion Pharmaceuticals , though 2Q profit declined year-on-year. Despite some investor concerns ahead of the quarter, AZN's quarter was robust and the mid-point of the initial guidance for the newly integrated AZN/ALXN entity is 5% above consensus estimates, Citigroup says. \"Given the trends in the quarter, we remain comfortable to be above the top end of the newly issued guidance,\" Citi analysts say, reiterating their buy rating. (philip.waller@wsj.com)</p><p>0829 GMT - The FTSE 100 Index gains 0.7%, or 48 points, to 7064 as gains for oil and mining stocks offset losses for Smith &amp; Nephew and BT. Anglo American rises 5% after it reported significantly higher first-half profit and said it would return $4.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Royal Dutch Shell shares advance 4% after it reported what analysts described as a strong 2Q. Business publisher Informa lifts 3% after raising 2021 revenue guidance and contract caterer Compass also gains 3% after a trading update. Still, Smith &amp; Nephew drops 6% amid uncertainty around the artificial hip-maker's 2H outlook. BT is also off 6% after 1Q revenue missed expectations.
