Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a rise of 450,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6% last month from 4.8%. Also, September job gains were raised to 312,000 from a previous estimate of 194,000, while August jobs were raised to 483,000 from 366,000.</p><p>“The Fed appears comfortable with the economy right now and today's jobs report validated that optimism,” said David&#xa0;Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth U.S.</p><p>“Third quarter earnings, the [Fed] plans to taper quantitative easing without rushing to raise rates, and the falling unemployment rate in October have created tailwinds for the equity market. It is not surprising to see another strong week for stocks,” he said.</p><p>However wages were up nearly 5% year over year, which can be a harbinger of stickier inflation. “If we continue to see strength in wage numbers going forward, it may catalyze the Fed to get more aggressive on taper and could pull forward rate hike expectations next year,” said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth.</p><p>Investors also snapped up Treasurys in the wake of the data, sending yields, which move the opposite direction of prices, down sharply.
