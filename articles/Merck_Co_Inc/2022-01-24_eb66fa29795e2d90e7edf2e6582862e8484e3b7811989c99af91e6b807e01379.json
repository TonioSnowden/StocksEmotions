  "text": "<p>Yet viruses are notorious for mutating in ways that allow them to bypass antivirals, especially when the drugs are given alone as is the case with the new Covid-19 pills.</p><p>The Covid-19 pills promise to keep people out of the hospital and slow the spread of the coronavirus, but resistance could jeopardize the usefulness of the drugs.</p><p>\"We know this is likely to happen at some point, so we need to beat it to the punch and nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand and starts to take over,\" said Katherine Seley-Radtke, a medicinal-chemistry professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.</p><p>Some researchers and the drugmakers, however, say the risk is low that resistance can develop to the new Covid-19 pills because they are taken over just five days, too short a time for the virus to change meaningfully.</p><p>Pfizer and Merck researchers said they didn't see resistance develop during the clinical trials evaluating the pills. The company researchers also said each of the pills has characteristics that cut the risk of resistance, though they are looking for any signs.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer and Merck-Ridgeback to monitor for resistance and to submit monthly reports on their findings as a condition of authorizing the new pills.</p><p>The FDA also said it may require the drugmakers to assess whether their drugs hold up against any variants of interest, and must provide drug samples to the government for its own evaluations.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
