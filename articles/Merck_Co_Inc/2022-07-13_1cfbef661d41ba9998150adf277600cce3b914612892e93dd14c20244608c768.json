  "text": "<p>\"We want to completely re-imagine photosynthesis to basically find new ways to fix CO2,\" said Dr. Erb.</p><p>The €1 million Future Insight Prize is awarded for work that enables innovations in health, nutrition and energy by German pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals company Merck KGaA, which isn't affiliated with U.S. drug company Merck &amp; Co. Dr. Erb wants to use the money to bring scientists such as genetic engineers to his team and to invest in technology.</p><p>The award is the latest sign of rising interest in technologies that can remove global-warming gases from the atmosphere and in some cases find commercial applications for them.</p><p>Every year, around 400 gigatons of carbon dioxide are extracted from the air via photosynthesis. The process, known as fixing, relies on enzymes that let plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugars in their cells. Enzymes are a kind of biocatalyst—a class of substances that drive chemical reactions. Dr. Erb and his team are designing new biocatalysts that are better at fixing carbon dioxide.</p><p>\"Our new photosynthesis has the potential to be 20% more efficient and also fix CO2 about 10 times faster,\" Dr. Erb said.</p><p>Using synthetic biology, Dr. Erb's \"Photosynthesis 2.0\" research team developed a \"toolbox\" of enzymes that can fix carbon dioxide and convert it into a new chemical building block. The enzymes were found in various organisms such as plants, microbes, bacteria or yeasts, and in some cases were genetically engineered to work well together.</p><p>These biocatalysts each enable different biochemical reactions and can be combined and produced as needed.</p><p>Dr. Erb said the aim is to \"invent an alternative operating system for photosynthesis,\" similar to the operating systems that underpin computer programs. It could be used to run many different programs and create different products.</p><p>The idea has been proven on a small scale. The researchers developed a process to use the more-efficient biocatalysts to fix CO2 in a laboratory. They also demonstrated that CO2 can be directly converted into pentadecane, a component of diesel fuel, and into a polyketide, a compound that can be used to make antibiotics.</p><p>The next step is to test the new operating system on a larger scale. That means trying it out on some hardware—living cells such as bacteria, algae and eventually plants. The researchers also want to experiment with how the new enzymes work on artificially created cells that fix CO2 but aren't alive.</p><p>\"Those are two directions we want to go,\" Dr. Erb said. \"Both are conceivable, and both have their pros and cons.\"</p><p>In theory, the technology could be used to make a wide range of carbon-based materials without causing any emissions. New products could also be created with the help of synthetic biology. For instance, the improved photosynthesis could be used to make products that could be fed to bacteria to make biodegradable plastics, basic materials for the cosmetics industry, or new kinds of food.</p><p>But it will take years before any products are ready for the market. \"We are basic researchers,\" Dr. Erb said. \"We are at the very beginning of the pipeline.\"</p><p>Write to Stefanie Haxel at stefanie.haxel@wsj.com</p><p>Scientists Get $1 Million Prize to Fight Climate Change With 'Photosynthesis 2.0'</p>",
