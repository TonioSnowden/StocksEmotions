  "title": "President Biden's Covid-19 Rebounds Amid Evidence Cases Tend to Be Mild to Moderate; Rebounds also tend to resolve without hospitalization, but researchers don't know what causes the small number of cases",
  "text": "<p>The arrival of Covid-19 drug Paxlovid at the end of last year heralded a new phase in the pandemic response: People who developed infections finally had a pill they could conveniently take at home to avoid severe disease.</p><p>Soon after the Pfizer Inc. antiviral went into use, however, a small number of patients began reporting their Covid-19 returned several days after finishing treatment.</p><p>President Biden is now the latest such rebound case, the White House said Saturday. Like many others experiencing rebounds, Mr. Biden is feeling well and not reporting symptoms, and the White House said he won't take more treatment but is isolating.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests the cases occur in a small percentage of people who took Paxlovid, tend to be mild to moderate and resolve without hospitalization. Yet the causes of the rebounds are still under investigation.</p><p>Research to date supports theories that the five-day treatment isn't long enough or the drug isn't potent enough, said Paul Sax, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.</p><p>The virus may return because it is replicating longer than the treatment, Dr. Sax and other researchers said, though Paxlovid might be preventing the worst of Covid-19.</p><p>\"The virus is sort of on a runaway train, so if you're going to get sick enough to go to the hospital, to go to the ICU and die, it may very well be that those first five, six days are crucial,\" said Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>Rebounds aren't common, both the clinical testing of Paxlovid and real-world research to date, have found.</p><p>Of 483 people at high risk of severe Covid-19, four who took Paxlovid experienced rebound symptoms, researchers said in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases last month.</p><p>Their cases resolved without further treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic researchers.</p><p>Health authorities and doctors say the rebounds shouldn't deter anyone at high risk of severe Covid-19 from taking Paxlovid. Dr. Wachter said it plays an important role limiting severe disease during the early days of infection.</p><p>\"The early phase is typically what gets people in trouble, it's sort of what sets off this cascade of either the virus marching through your body or your immune system going haywire and basically attacking yourself,\" he said. </p><p>More than 3 million courses of Paxlovid have been administered in the U.S. PHOTO: Alexander Cohn/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Both clinical testing and real-world research has supported the drug's effectiveness.</p><p>In the Mayo Clinic study, two of the 483 people who took Paxlovid needed to be hospitalized within a month of treatment.</p><p>A study examining the medical records of 11,270 people who got Paxlovid found that 0.77% were hospitalized within a month of treatment, researchers from Case Western Reserve University and the National Institutes of Health said.</p><p>Some 5.4% of the people who took Paxlovid tested positive again within 30 days, and 5.9% had a recurrence of symptoms, according to the study, which was posted last month on the medRxiv preprint server.</p><p>The people who rebounded tended to have other underlying medical conditions, the researchers said.</p><p>Researchers probing the causes of the rebounds don't know whether people undergoing the episodes prolong the time that people are contagious.</p><p>\"They might have been people who were destined to have long periods of viral replication anyway and the difference is that Paxlovid has taken that first phase of replication and lowered it, and then when it stops, it comes back,\" Dr. Sax said.</p><p>Covid-19 patients lacked many treatment options before the arrival of Paxlovid and another antiviral pill from Merck &amp; Co. and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP called Lagevrio.</p><p>Earlier in the pandemic, Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir was given to people in the hospital to reduce their stays, while antibody drugs were available for the newly infected but had to be taken at the hospital or a clinic.</p><p>Many of the antibody drugs went unused, however, because eligible patients couldn't make it to an infusion site to get treatment.</p><p>Demand for Paxlovid especially has been heavy since its authorization last December, though initial supplies were limited as Pfizer ramped up manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>More than 3 million courses of Paxlovid and more than 480,000 courses of Lagevrio have been administered in the U.S. through July 24, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Rebounds have occurred among people taking both drugs, according to researchers.</p><p>\"While we continue to monitor real-world data, we remain very confident in the treatment's effectiveness at preventing severe outcomes from Covid-19,\" Pfizer said.</p><p>Pfizer said this week it was talking with the Food and Drug Administration to begin a study of patients receiving additional courses of the drug on top of the initial five-day course.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
