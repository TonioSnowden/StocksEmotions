  "text": "<p>Sanofi plans to invest €400m a year to develop vaccines based on the novel mRNA technology that has disrupted competition among the world's biggest vaccine makers since the pandemic began.</p> <p>The French pharmaceutical group will open a “dedicated&#xa0;vaccine&#xa0;mRNA centre of excellence”, with 400 employees spanning research and development, and manufacturing at sites in Cambridge in the US and Lyon in France, it said in statement on Tuesday. </p> <p>The group aims to have at least six mRNA vaccine “clinical&#xa0;candidates” by 2025, although it did not specify for what infectious diseases.</p> <p>The move comes after Sanofi was beaten to market last year in the race to develop Covid-19 vaccines, with new challengers including BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna proving the speed and agility advantages of mRNA platforms. The French drugmaker has two vaccines in development.</p> <p>The investment is a recognition that Sanofi needs more expertise in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2978026-4bc2-439c-a561-a1972eeba940\">mRNA technology</a> to defend and expand its vaccine business, which brought in about 16 per cent of its €36bn revenue last year and has relied on traditional manufacturing techniques. </p> <p>Just under half of Sanofi's vaccine sales come from flu shots, which analysts say could also be disrupted by mRNA technology in the coming years. </p> <p>Before the pandemic, Sanofi was one of the world's biggest vaccine makers by sales along with GlaxoSmithKline and Merck, but it slipped down the rankings last year as mRNA technology <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/657b123a-78ba-4fba-b18e-23c07e313331\">created new winners.</a> </p> <p>Investors are now paying more attention to the once slow-moving, unglamorous vaccine business as they try to understand the extent of the potential disruption.</p> <p>Meanwhile Sanofi faced a roughly six-month delay to its Covid-19 vaccine rollout after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7b5da3f-f863-4cf2-bd0d-2694dfe6ae1e\">dosing error</a> derailed the clinical trial. The jab, based on the more traditional recombinant DNA technology, is being developed in partnership with GSK, and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53062063-2485-4c41-bb66-a25a82fe0351\">groups aim</a> for regulatory approval by the end of the year. </p> <p>Sanofi also has a Covid-19 jab based on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5d03854-39bb-48cd-9a01-5fb2a0dfbba8\">mRNA technology</a> in early-stage testing in partnership with US company Translate Bio. It began working with the Lexington, Massachusetts-based company on mRNA vaccines more generally in 2018, and the two expanded their partnership last year to broadly “address current and future infectious diseases”. </p> <p>Sanofi and Translate Bio announced last week that they were beginning an early-stage or Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating a mRNA-based vaccine against seasonal influenza.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We've all witnessed the promise of mRNA technology during this pandemic and&#xa0;are&#xa0;now looking to extend that promise to&#xa0;select&#xa0;annual vaccines,” said Jean-François Toussaint, who heads Sanofi's vaccine R&amp;D, in a statement. </p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Leila Abboud in Paris 2021 'Sanofi boosts investment in mRNA to keep pace in vaccines' FT.com 29 June.
