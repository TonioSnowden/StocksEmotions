  "title": "Digital-Therapeutics Offer a New Model for Medicine, but Face Obstacles; Developers of software-based disease treatments test new business strategies",
  "text": "<p>Digital therapeutics, often delivered through an app or videogame, are designed to treat a disease or manage its symptoms. Globally, venture capitalists invested $3.41 billion in the sector last year, up from $1.46 billion in 2020, according to market tracker CB Insights, betting that such therapies can treat many physical and mental-health conditions—including those not well served by medications, or where doctors specialized in the illness are in short supply.</p><p>Companies have been developing software-based therapies for more than a decade, but Covid-19 accelerated investor and patient interest in digital alternatives to conventional care.</p><p>Companies find that getting the attention of busy physicians, and persuading them to prescribe a digital therapy, can be difficult and expensive. Patients also must be willing to adopt digital treatments, which typically require more effort on their part than taking a pill.</p><p>\"The pandemic probably put unrealistic expectations on a lot of digital health, not just digital therapeutics,\" said Dave Stevenson, a managing director of Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, a venture arm of drugmaker Merck &amp; Co. focused on digital health. \"Not unrealistic expectations to the potential, unrealistic to how fast we get to the potential.\"</p><p>Merck GHI Fund-backed Welldoc Inc. launched a prescription digital therapy for diabetes patients in 2014 and originally marketed it to physicians. That proved to be too difficult and costly, so the company in 2017 worked with the Food and Drug Administration to revise the regulation of the therapy, called BlueStar, said Welldoc Chief Executive Kevin McRaith.</p><p>As before, BlueStar still requires a prescription for aspects of the treatment that help patients manage their insulin. Per the 2017 change, other aspects of BlueStar, such as coaching to diabetes patients, no longer require a prescription, a change that has enabled Columbia, Md.-based Welldoc to sell the technology to clients such as health insurers and employers, which can offer it as a benefit to members or employees.</p><p>That has led to a turnaround for Welldoc, enabling it to scale up more quickly. Welldoc, which says its chronic-care platform also provides support across areas such as hypertension and heart failure, turned a profit in 2021, according to Mr. McRaith, who was an executive with drugmakers Human Genome Sciences and Genentech before joining Welldoc in 2014. There is a playbook for launching a product in the pharmaceutical industry, he said.</p><p>\"In the digital-therapeutics, digital-health space, that playbook is still being written,\" he said.</p><p>Similarly, Kirkland, Wash.-based Freespira Inc., whose prescription digital therapy treats breathing problems tied to panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, marketed directly to clinicians when it first launched in 2014. It shifted strategy to focus largely on health insurers in 2020 after concluding the original approach wouldn't scale fast enough, said President Simon Thomas.</p><p>One customer, Children's Community Health Plan, an insurer in Wisconsin that primarily serves Medicaid patients, has found that it saves twice as much, through reductions in use of healthcare services, as the cost of the Freespira treatment, said Mark Rakowski, the health plan's chief operating officer.</p><p>Competition among digital-health companies seeking the health plan's business is strong, and it can only adopt so many of these therapies with the resources it has, Mr. Rakowski said.</p><p>\"A day doesn't go by when I don't get three to five emails telling me about the latest, greatest solution,\" Mr. Rakowski said. \"That's one of the biggest challenges we have—how do we evaluate all these digital or remote solutions? We don't have the bandwidth to do an unlimited number of treatments or solutions.\"</p><p>Some venture capitalists see an opportunity to avoid some of these challenges by backing companies whose digital therapeutic doesn't need a prescription. Often, venture-backed startups going this route have conducted clinical studies to validate the efficacy of their product, even if it doesn't require a prescription.</p><p>While this enables them to commercialize quickly, it also means companies with clinically validated products must rise above the noise created by digital products that are less well-studied, some observers said.</p><p>Some startups have won over patients by tapping into the willingness to pay out of pocket to manage a condition that isn't well-treated today.</p><p>Boston-based Embr Labs, for example, sells a wristband, used in conjunction with an app, designed to provide relief from hot flashes caused by menopause. It has managed to sell these devices directly to consumers at a price of $299. The device uses thermal technology to help regulate temperature.</p><p>People want immediacy and the ability to control their health, and are often frustrated with existing options and the medical system, said CEO Elizabeth Gazda.</p><p>\"There's this kind of stick-it-to-the man-attitude,\" she said. \"If you can tap into that frustration, you've got a business that's going to explode.\"</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
