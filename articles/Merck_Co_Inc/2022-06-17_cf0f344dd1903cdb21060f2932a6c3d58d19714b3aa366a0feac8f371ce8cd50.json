  "title": "Merck Eyes Purchase of Biotech Seagen; Pulling off a deal could be tricky given the risk of a regulatory challenge, and it is possible the companies could end up striking a marketing agreement instead",
  "text": "<p>Other unnamed suitors are also eyeing Seagen, a perennially speculated takeover target, some of the people said.</p><p>If there is a deal, it would be significant, given Seagen's market value of roughly $28 billion.</p><p>New Jersey-based Merck has a market value of roughly $216 billion. Acquiring Seagen would help bolster its lineup of cancer drugs, led by the blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda, Merck's top-selling product with $17.2 billion in sales last year.</p><p>Seagen helped pioneer a class of cancer therapy that works like a guided missile attacking tumors with toxins. By pinpointing their hit, the therapies, called antibody drug conjugates, can maximize the treatment's benefits while minimizing side effects by not going off target. Among Seaen's products are Adcetris, which had $1.4 billion in sales last year.</p><p>Seagen reported a total of $1.6 billion in sales last year.</p><p>The two companies have existing ties, including a collaboration to develop and commercialize a breast-cancer treatment. Under the agreement, Seagen and Merck have said they planned to test the experimental treatment in combination with Keytruda. Merck agreed to pay $600 million up-front to Seagen, while buying five million shares for $1 billion.</p><p>Merck also licenses one of Seagen's drugs outside of the U.S.</p><p>Seagen was previously known as Seattle Genetics and is based in Washington state. Co-founder Clay Siegall resigned as chief executive and chairman in May as the company was investigating his conduct following an allegation of domestic violence, which the company has said he denied. Chief Medical Officer Roger Dansey has been acting as interim CEO while the company looks for a replacement.</p><p>Merck's pursuit of Seagen follows an $11.5 billion deal to buy Acceleron Pharma Inc. last year and the spinoff of a collection of slower-growth assets, including its women's health products and cholesterol treatments, into a new publicly traded company.</p><p>That move, announced in 2020, paved the way for Merck to focus on growth areas including cancer, vaccines and animal health. Merck CEO Robert Davis has said Merck wants to do deals, which analysts say the company needs to bolster its pipeline and portfolio, and to diversify beyond Keytruda in particular.</p><p>Healthcare is typically one of the busiest sectors when it comes to deal making. But deal volumes in the sector so far this year are roughly half of what they were in 2021, driven by declining stock prices, lofty valuations for targets and increased risk of antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Jonathan D.
