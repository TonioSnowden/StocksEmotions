  "title": "GSK Bolsters Vaccine Business With $3.3 Billion Deal for Affinivax; New vaccine technology could allow broader vaccination against common diseases, British drug giant says",
  "text": "<p>The Affinivax technology was developed by doctors at Boston Children's Hospital. Its most-advanced candidate targets 24 different types of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a family of bacteria behind diseases such as meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis, in a single shot.</p><p>The experimental vaccine, known as AFX3772, was shown in early human trials to elicit a stronger immune response against many of the Streptococcus pneumoniae types than two of the leading vaccines already used against what are known as pneumococcal diseases. The Food and Drug Administration in July granted it breakthrough therapy designation based on early human-trial data. That designation is aimed at speeding the development of drugs or vaccines for serious conditions, where early evidence suggests there may be a substantial improvement over available options.</p><p>Roger Connor, president of vaccines at GSK, said the technology was attractive because it had the potential to significantly broaden immunization against pneumococcal diseases. Currently, the broadest shot available covers 23 different types of the bacteria. Affinivax's most advanced shot tackles 24 types, but it is also in the early stages of developing a vaccine that would cover 30 different types of pneumococcal bacteria. \"There's still a really large unmet need from other serotypes not being addressed by those vaccines,\" he said. \"This technology gives us an opportunity to do that.\"</p><p>Pneumococcal diseases are a major cause of death among children and older people around the world, especially in developing countries. While the currently available shots address the types most frequently associated with severe disease, around 90 types of pneumococcal bacteria, known as serotypes, have been identified world-wide. The market for pneumococcal vaccines was worth $7.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to more than $10 billion a year by 2028, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Currently available pneumococcal vaccines include Pfizer Inc.'s Prevnar 13 and Merck &amp; Co.'s Pneumovax 23. Those two are based on the sugars that are found on the surface of the bacteria, and stimulate an antibody response. Affinivax's vaccine additionally includes two proteins found on the surface of the bacteria that elicit two types of immune response, T-cells and antibodies, GSK said.</p><p>Analysts said it wasn't clear how much of a real-world benefit the Affinivax shot could confer over existing shots. Pfizer's Prevnar-13, for example, has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization with the pneumococcal types that it covers by 73%, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>The deal is GSK's largest in vaccines since its 2015 acquisition of Novartis AG's vaccines business for $5.25 billion as part of a larger, three-part transaction that also involved the British company selling its marketed cancer medicines to its Swiss rival and combining their consumer-health care businesses. It comes as GSK prepares to spin its consumer-health care division into an independent, London-listed company called Haleon, planned for July. The remaining part of GSK will focus solely on innovative prescription drugs and vaccines.</p><p>Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com</p><p>GSK Bolsters Vaccine Business With $3.3 Billion Deal for Affinivax</p>",
