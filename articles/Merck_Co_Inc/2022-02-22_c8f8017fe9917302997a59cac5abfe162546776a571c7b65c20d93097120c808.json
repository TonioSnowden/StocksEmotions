  "title": "Nimble UK regulator is a draw for drugmakers, says former vaccines chief",
  "text": "<p>The former head of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce said the British regulator's ability to move nimbly during the pandemic is luring new biotech companies to the country, as she unveiled her first major investment since returning to the private sector. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d9edc58-7922-496a-942f-5360bfe84876\">Kate Bingham</a> will chair EyeBio, a biotech company founded by two American ophthalmology pioneers who are choosing to establish their group in the UK. The company is seeking to find new approaches to the huge unmet need of treating diseases causing blindness. </p> <p>“We're building the team here so that we can run the clinical trials here,” she said. “We've got a really flexible, friendly regulator that will allow us to generate that data quickly, which will then define whether or not the approaches we're taking will work or not.”</p> <p>Bingham, who has returned to her job as managing partner at London-based fund manager SV Health Investors, said the speed of regulatory decision making and clinical trials during Covid “put us on the map”. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency was the first regulator to approve a Covid-19 vaccine and the country's Recovery Trial discovered treatments used around the world. </p> <p>The UK is trying to attract more life sciences investment post-Brexit, with the newly independent regulator establishing an initiative <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd80b394-ac49-41ca-aee3-8933fd7c0da9\">to cut the time</a> it takes to get treatments approved. For drugmakers granted the special status, the regulator will review data on a rolling basis and deliver a decision within 150 days of the final submission. </p> <p>“I absolutely believe that the MHRA has to carve out a different niche compared with EMA [European Medicines Agency]. It can't just be identical to what the EMA is doing. Because otherwise why would anybody ever apply to the UK or the MHRA?” she said. </p> <p>Bingham also called on City of London pension managers to improve funding of life sciences venture capital, pushing back against a “prudent man approach” that she believes is constraining investment. </p> <p>Investors in the UK have traditionally been cautious about funding riskier early-stage biotechs, the vast majority of which list on the Nasdaq. But a recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c90d17c6-6196-4c8a-88c2-e2cef9a692f2\">sell-off in biotech stocks</a> in the US has seen many generalist investors retreat from the sector. </p> <p>Bingham said she was not surprised by the pull back because it was clearly “not a good thing” when companies that have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4abf0f81-7e5a-4e93-8ccc-dbd23d5c88f3\">not yet begun trials</a> in humans are going public. </p> <p>“It's by and large always likely to end up with companies underdelivering,” she said. “Fundamentally, if you are developing good drugs, there's going to be no market that will not be interested in taking those.”&#xa0;</p> <p>EyeBio aims to develop treatment for conditions that affect hundreds of millions of people, including age-related macular degeneration, eye disease caused by diabetes and glaucoma. &#xa0;</p> <p>Founders David Guyer and Tony Adamis developed the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcb5463a-1347-11da-beee-00000e2511c8\">first in a new class</a> of treatments — Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor inhibitors — that have cut blindness in half since they came on the market in the early 2000s. The pair sold their last company Eyetech to OSI Pharmaceuticals for $935mn in 2005. </p> <p>The drugs, which work by stopping the growth of problematic blood vessels in the eye, generated $11.6bn in revenue in 2020. Now, the pair want to work on drugs that could be taken in combination with the VEGF inhibitors, improving efficacy, as well as making the treatments more convenient, by making the injections needed to administer them less frequent. &#xa0;</p> <p>“We have unfinished business,” said Guyer. “We showed people that this was an unbelievable area to develop drugs and why? Because the eye is so small but there are at least five multibillion-dollar markets in the eye.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The company has raised $65mn series A funding, far higher than the average series A for a UK biotech of $23mn last year, according to data from the BioIndustry Association and analytics company Clarivate. Investors include the venture capital business of US pharmaceutical company Merck, and the round was co-led by Samsara BioCapital, French firm Jeito Capital, and Bingham at SV Health Investors. </p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in London 2022 'Nimble UK regulator is a draw for drugmakers, says former vaccines chief' FT.com 22 February.
