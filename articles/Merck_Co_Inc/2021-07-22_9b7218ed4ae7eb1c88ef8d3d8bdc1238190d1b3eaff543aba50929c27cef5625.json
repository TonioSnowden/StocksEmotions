  "text": "<h2>The newly minted private equity billionaire behind a three-way Spac deal</h2> <p>In the early 2000s,<strong> Michael Rees</strong> and<strong> Sean Ward</strong> were like thousands of other just-out-of-school strivers trying to cut their teeth in high-pressure investment banking and legal jobs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rees, from Pittsburgh, landed at<strong> Lehman Brothers</strong>, while Ward, who hailed from Florida, was at powerhouse law firm <strong>Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell</strong>.</p> <p>Nearly two decades later, however, they've become fully-fledged tycoons who, accidentally or otherwise, have built one of the best mouse traps in private equity.</p> <p>Their firm, <strong>Dyal Capital</strong>, began 10 years ago buying up small chunks of high-flying private equity managers including <strong>Vista</strong>, <strong>Providence</strong>, <strong>Silver Lake </strong>and<strong> Bridgepoint</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181f6b11-9dad-4e92-b2e8-52cc9a43090b\">listed its shares in</a> London on Wednesday.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Dyal contraption has proved so successful that it recently listed its own shares through a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4025f44-caec-4195-8f3b-2cd8c15e5db4\">complex Spac merger</a> which valued it at about $15bn (the new firm, Blue Owl, combines Dyal along with a credit fund, <strong>Owl Rock</strong>).</p> <p>Dyal cannily realised that post-financial crisis, Wall Street's centre of gravity had shifted to private capital firms — their cash infusions proving a godsend to the finance Masters of the Universe.</p> <p>But the ascent of Rees and Dyal has not been without its bumps, as DD's Mark Vandevelde and Sujeet Indap detail in <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/f63c2636-829c-48b1-9abb-288510cbf816?\">this new Big Read</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Spac deal with Owl Rock led two investment firms that had taken Dyal's money, <strong>Sixth Street Partners </strong>and <strong>Golub Capital</strong>, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c18c044-dfe2-459b-bc9e-36d9d165daf3\">cry foul</a>. Each believed that the new Blue Owl competed directly with their lending businesses, and that Dyal had gone from friend to foe.</p> <p>Dyal believed the two firms were mistaken in understanding their legal contracts, or, more nefariously, were simply trying to extract a ransom.</p> <p>The litigation the pair brought proved fruitless, however, even if the bad blood lingers on.</p> <p>The now-closed Blue Owl deal has made Rees a billionaire. The firm just announced its first <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/dyal-buys-stake-in-phoenix-suns-valuing-team-at-1-55-billion\">investment</a> into the<strong> Phoenix Suns</strong>, an <strong>NBA </strong>franchise (the Suns just lost the NBA Finals to the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong>, themselves owned by <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2021/07/20/bucks-winning-nba-chamionship-a-goal-set-in-2014.html\">private equity tycoons</a>).&#xa0;</p> <p>Expect Rees and Ward to buy the drinks and have some good stories to tell at reunions with their former colleagues, who are still grinding away waiting for their own golden tickets.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tom Barrack: from private equity to private diplomacy</h2> <p>Some years before he was arrested by US federal agents to face charges of acting as an illegal agent of the United Arab Emirates, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bbb0020-b48b-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b\"><strong>Tom Barrack</strong></a> gave a talk in Los Angeles entitled “Secrets of my Success”. It may yet turn out to be prophetic.</p> <p>Barrack's special talent was not so much for crunching numbers or forecasting recessions as it was for knowing everyone, everywhere. Elite polo players; Dallas billionaires; Hollywood glitterati — Barrack knew them all, and whenever he could, he tried to be helpful.</p> <p>“Karma really works,” the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/172cc02c-62a0-11e9-a27a-fdd51850994c\"><strong>Colony Capital</strong></a> founder explained in Los Angeles that day. “It works, eventually.”</p> <p>Barrack was taken into custody in California on Tuesday morning, the US justice department said, and charged with committing federal crimes that allegedly stemmed from his desire to be helpful to Middle Eastern royalty while serving in what prosecutors alleged to be an informal advisory role for former US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD's Mark Vandevelde has the details <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83e5dfbf-fb11-4f62-8242-920e817adea6\">here</a>.</p> <p>The DoJ also charged <strong>Matthew Grimes</strong>, a former Colony executive who was arrested alongside Barrack, and <strong>Rashid Al Malik</strong>, an Emirati who lived in California on a student visa and who the Feds say is still at large.</p> <p>Barrack's <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1413381/download\">alleged offences</a> include covertly lobbying on behalf of the UAE for issues including a Saudi-led regional embargo on Qatar, and the legal status of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist organisation that Trump considered labelling a terrorist organisation. He is also accused of lying to investigators about his activities.</p> <p>The Colony founder's activities in Washington have attracted scrutiny before. He collaborated with the Wall Street groups <strong>Apollo </strong>and <strong>Blackstone</strong> on a plan to use Middle Eastern money to buy the nuclear reactor maker Westinghouse, according to a 2019 investigation by congressional Democrats.</p> <p>“Our ppl wants u to help,” Rashid Al Malik texted Barrack in 2017, according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors. “They were hoping you can officially run the agendas.”</p> <p>“I will!” Barrack replied, according to the filings.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Barrack, who left Colony in March, said on Tuesday that he planned to fight the charges.</p> <h2>Interview: an ex-Goldman exec on why US banks are failing to innovate</h2> <p>We've told you about how banks are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37945600-b2ca-4739-8c79-d3f6cbb83ceb\">increasing spending</a> to take on the growing threat of fintech.</p> <p>But a top former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> executive seems to think that it's not enough.</p> <p>Banks need to take a different approach to building new technology if they want to compete with fintech, <strong>Sheila Patel</strong>, who retired in December as chair of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' $2tn asset management arm, told the FT's Imani Moise in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3575b4d-fe8d-4d60-824f-4737c9012d81\">interview</a>.</p> <p>Patel, named by <strong>Fortune</strong> as one of the most powerful women in banking, will join <strong>Boston Consulting Group</strong>-backed venture capital firm <strong>B Capital</strong>. Her aim is to help grow the technology companies shaking up the industry where she spent 30 years of her career.</p> <p>“Financial institutions of all sizes, but particularly larger financial institutions, need to find ways to engage in innovation outside their walls, because it's moving that way anyway,” she told the FT.</p> <p>Much of that innovation was occurring overseas, said Raj Ganguly, one of B Capital's co-founders, where within finance, the firm conducts 80 per cent of its investments. “A fintech entrepreneur in the US basically builds things on top of existing really good rails . . . Fintech entrepreneurs in India or Indonesia, they're building everything.”</p> <p>For US lenders looking to break out of their routines, Wall Street may be beginning to feel a bit claustrophobic.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has appointed <strong>Pier Luigi Colizzi</strong>, currently head of M&amp;A for Europe, Middle East and Africa, as head of investment banking for continental Europe. He will join the lender's Europe executive committee.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has lost four more senior bankers including <strong>Max Mesny</strong>, a financial-institutions banker in London, who is joining <strong>Perella Weinberg </strong>as a partner, per <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/credit-suisse-exodus-in-full-swing-as-more-senior-bankers-leave?sref=OziMsGoK\">Bloomberg</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Chris Shelley</strong>, an executive in <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>'s private wealth management division, has joined London-based investment firm <strong>Stanhope Capital Group </strong>as its new chief financial officer.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Venture capital firm <strong>General Catalyst</strong> has appointed <strong>Kenneth Frazier</strong>, former chief executive and executive chair of Merck, as chair of its health assurance initiatives.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Rocket men </strong>Sir Richard Branson was once Jeff Bezos's chief competitor in the billionaire race to space. But the British tycoon has been overshadowed by Elon Musk, his brasher, Twitter-fingered adversary, whose SpaceX is already outpacing the Amazon founder in orbit.

But according to former employees, there was also a toxic work culture.
