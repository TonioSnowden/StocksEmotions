  "text": "<p>Investors widely expect economic data to weaken as the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates to rein in inflation. What will be key, analysts say, is how quickly or slowly the data worsen. Many hope that central-bank policy will pull inflation back from multidecade highs without causing a recession.</p><p>\"What the market is wanting to see is that there is some cooling in the labor market, but it's not going to want to see a crash,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 57.54 points, or 1.5%, to 3902.62, notching its longest winning streak since March. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 259.49 points, or 2.3%, to 11621.35 and ended Thursday with its longest winning streak since March.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 346.87 points, or 1.1%, to 31384.55.</p><p>Investors will next watch for Friday's employment report. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect U.S. employers to have added 250,000 jobs in June, down from 390,000 in May.</p><p>Stocks rose broadly Thursday, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors ending in the green.</p><p>GameStop jumped $17.69, or 15%, to $135.12 after the retailer on Wednesday declared a 4-for-1 stock split.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose 97 cents, or 22%, to $5.44 after Interim Chief Executive Officer Sue Gove disclosed the acquisition of 50,000 shares of the company's stock in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</p><p>Shares of Seagen rose $2.82, or 1.6%, to $177.95 after The Wall Street Journal reported Merck &amp; Co. is in advanced talks to buy the cancer biotech in a deal that could be valued at roughly $40 billion or more. Merck fell 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $93.01.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.007% from 2.911% on Wednesday, while the yield on the two-year note settled at 3.039% from 2.961%. When the latter exceeds the former, the result is an inverted yield curve, a market signal that has often preceded recessions. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>In commodity markets, oil prices rebounded after dropping below $100 a barrel earlier in the week on fears that a recession would reduce demand for crude.</p><p>U.S. crude oil jumped $4.20, or 4.3%, to $102.73 a barrel, notching its biggest one-day percentage gain since May.</p><p>Natural-gas futures shot up 14% to $6.297 per million British thermal units after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that domestic stockpiles were more than 12% lower than normal for this time of year after a weekly build that was significantly smaller than analysts and traders had expected.</p><p>Overseas, the British pound jumped against the dollar after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would step down, following a 36-hour period in which more than 50 ministers and senior government aides resigned.</p><p>The U.K.'s benchmark FTSE 100 index gained 1.1%. While currencies can be sensitive to political shifts, analysts see British shares as relatively insulated from the U.K.'s political turmoil, since FTSE 100 companies generate about 75% of their revenue outside Britain. \"It doesn't fundamentally change the path the U.K. is on,\" said Mr. Ganesh of UBS. \"With new leadership, it's still going to be about higher inflation [and] the U.K.'s trade relationship with the European Union.\"</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.9%, while Germany's DAX index rose 2%. European markets have calmed in recent days after the Norwegian government intervened to end an oil workers' strike that threatened to more than halve the country's gas exports, a key regional source of energy.</p><p>Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.8%, China's CSI 300 was up 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.3%, DJIA futures lost 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.4%.</p><p>---</p><p>Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
