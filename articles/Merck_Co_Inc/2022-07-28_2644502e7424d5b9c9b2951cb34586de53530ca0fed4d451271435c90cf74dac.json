  "title": "Pfizer Sales Climb Again on Covid-19 Products; Drugmaker sees better full-year sales and profits, but foreign exchange impact is expected to wipe out gains",
  "text": "<p>Pfizer Inc. is taking steps to maintain its blockbuster Covid-19 product sales, but there were warning signs in the company's guidance and the rest of the business might not offer much cushion.</p><p>Sales from Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and Paxlovid pill gave the company a boost, as products for other diseases delivered mixed results. Excluding the pandemic products, sales rose $128 million, or 1% operationally.</p><p>The New York-based drug company said revenue rose 47% to $27.7 billion, with $8.1 billion of that coming from global sales of Paxlovid. The pandemic vaccine, called Comirnaty and developed with BioNTech SE, generated sales of more than $8.8 billion, up 13% from a year ago, with more doses going to emerging and other international markets, though deliveries in the U.S. and Canada have slowed, according to Pfizer.</p><p>Quarterly sales for the two pandemic products exceeded analysts' forecasts. Despite the impact from currency conversion, Pfizer maintained its guidance of the vaccine generating $32 billion in sales this year, and Paxlovid generating $22 billion.</p><p>Pfizer's sales guidance for the pandemic products are lower than what analysts expect this year, suggesting it is risky to rely too much on the Covid-19 products, especially as the rest of its products deliver mixed results. And the unpredictable nature of the virus makes it unclear whether additional efforts in Covid-19 research and development will pay off.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Pfizer's business? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Still, citing the need to keep fighting the virus, Pfizer said it is initiating new studies for next-generation Covid-19 vaccines and testing Paxlovid in new potential patient populations. The efforts come as health experts and authorities say that the virus remains difficult to predict.</p><p>\"After 2Â½ long years, like everyone else, we would hope that this global health crisis would be over soon,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said on an earnings call. \"But as much as hope is important, hope is not science. And science is telling us that Covid-19 likely will remain a major global healthcare concern for years to come.\"</p><p>Pfizer said it is developing two Covid-19 booster shots that target both the ancestral strain and an Omicron subvariant, for delivery in the fall. It has provided data to the European Union on a shot that targets the initial Omicron variant. Meanwhile, at the request of U.S. regulators, it is developing a vaccine targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron. Moderna Inc. is also taking different approaches with countries.</p><p>Pfizer said it is advancing next-generation Covid-19 vaccines. This week, the company began a separate midstage trial studying a modified Covid-19 vaccine and said it would begin testing later this year a candidate that would target a variety of SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses.</p><p>Pfizer recently agreed to supply 105 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. government, for $3.2 billion, with shots targeting Omicron expected for the fall.</p><p>Paxlovid is cleared in the U.S. for use in people with mild to moderate symptoms but at high risk of developing severe disease. Pfizer commands a 90% share of the U.S. market for Covid-19 antiviral pills. The Food and Drug Administration has also cleared for use Lagevrio, a pill from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.</p><p>Use of Paxlovid outside the U.S. in countries that have supply agreements with Pfizer increased 116% between June 24 and July 24, the company said.</p><p>Despite the high use of Paxlovid, Pfizer estimates many doctors still aren't prescribing the drug to many eligible patients, and many people are unaware they are at high risk of developing severe disease.</p><p>Pfizer has supply deals with countries to provide 35 million courses of Paxlovid, and is in talks with others, said Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals President Angela Hwang. Countries, however, are contracting with less urgency than they did with the vaccine, she said, and aren't asking for large amounts of supply up front, preferring smaller but more frequent contracting instead.</p><p>Pfizer plans to begin separate studies of Paxlovid in people with weakened immune systems and in hospitalized patients. It is also in talks with U.S. regulators about studying people to be retreated with Paxlovid, after reports of some people experiencing a rebound of symptoms.</p><p>Paxlovid hasn't shown a benefit in people at low-risk of developing severe Covid-19, and it failed a study as a preventive measure.</p><p>Even as its Covid product sales remained strong in the second quarter, Pfizer is on the hunt for deals, as it looks to generate $25 billion in additional revenue by 2030. It recently said it would acquire Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co.</p><p>Strong sales from the Covid business helped offset mixed results from other products.</p><p>Pfizer noted that sales of its smoking cessation treatment Chantix are down 99%, after shipments were paused due to heightened levels of a probable carcinogen found in the drug.</p><p>Global sales of the breast-cancer drug Ibrance were down 6% from a year ago to $1.4 billion, and arthritis drug Xeljanz sales were down 27% to $430 million, while those of blood thinner Eliquis were up 18% to roughly $1.5 billion.</p><p>The company said Thursday that it is now guiding for $2 billion more in annual revenue than previously. However, currency conversion is expected to entirely offset those increases due to a strong U.S. dollar.</p><p>For the second-quarter, Pfizer reported profit of $9.91 billion, or $1.73 a share, up from $5.56 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Pfizer said earnings per share adjusted for one-time items were $2.04 in the latest quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.72 a share.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
