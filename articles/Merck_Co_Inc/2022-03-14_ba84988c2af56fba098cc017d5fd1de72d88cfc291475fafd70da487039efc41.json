  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Healthcare Suppliers Keep Selling to Russia",
  "text": "<p>\"If our products don't get to the patients in need, people will die or have severe consequences,\" Johnson &amp; Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said at an investor conference last week.</p><p>J&amp;J plans to continue to provide what it said are essential products to Russia. Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. said it has stopped doing new business in Russia, though it will keep distributing certain cancer drugs and finish clinical trials.</p><p>Bayer AG's drug and crop divisions are still operating in Russia. Withdrawing seeds, pesticides and other products, a company spokesman said, would exacerbate food shortages due to the important role of Ukraine and Russia in the global wheat supply.</p><p>\"A suspension of deliveries for cancer or cardiovascular patients would not be ethically justifiable and would heavily impact the civilian population of Russia,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Russia isn't a big market for Western healthcare companies. Sales in the country account for less than 2% of the companies' world-wide total, according to analysts and companies. Russia imported about $700 million in U.S. pharmaceutical products last year, according to S&amp;P Global Inc.'s market intelligence unit.</p><p>Some 80% to 85% of Russian-made drugs, however, depend on imported ingredients, according to RNC Pharma, a Moscow market research company. Russian pharmaceutical companies are struggling to import the main ingredients, said Pavel Rasshchupkin, RNC's commercial director.</p><p>Medicines haven't gone into shortages so far, but the devaluation of the ruble has driven up prices, Mr. Rasshchupkin said. Pharmacies are seeing panic buying, he said.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin last week signed into law \"anticrisis\" measures, among which were policies aimed at boosting supplies of domestically made medicines and medical devices, such as the option to ban exports of certain drugs. An Interfax news agency report on the law didn't specify vaccines.</p><p>Many Western drugmakers have issued statements voicing opposition to the Russian invasion, expressing support for Ukranians and making donations to help Ukraine and refugees.</p><p>Merck &amp; Co., Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which have continued most activities in Russia, are among drugmakers that say they have paused enrollment in clinical trials in the country.</p><p>Bayer and other larger companies that sell over-the-counter drugs and healthcare-related consumer goods said they have pulled advertising from Russia. Russia bans direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC said it wouldn't enter into any contracts that support the Russian administration or military, such as agreements to supply vaccines for military immunization drives. Royal Philips NV has stopped selling consumer products like electric toothbrushes in Russia but continues to supply medical equipment, a spokesman said.</p><p>Some 300 biotech CEOs signed a pledge to halt business development in Russia. \"The goal was to influence Russian political thinking through those that surround Putin, said Jeremy Levin, chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics Inc. and one of the letter's authors. The pledge made an exception for the transport of medicines.</p><p>Drugmakers have also said they are working to protect their employees and ensure their medicines reach Russian patients.</p><p>So far, companies haven't reported significant disruptions to their supply chains or operations in Russia. Official sanctions haven't targeted health products. Yet sanctions are forcing companies to scramble to provide their products and are likely to create more disruptions, according to experts and industry officials.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
