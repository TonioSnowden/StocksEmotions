  "text": "<p>* Trade Desk jumped 19% after the advertising-software firm said net income rose 44% in the third quarter from the same period in 2020.</p><p>* The selling pressure continued on Peloton Interactive, pushing shares of the fitness-equipment maker down 5.7%. The stock began to slump last week after Peloton said the return to gyms was hurting sales and subscriptions.</p><p>* Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global rose 3.3% as bitcoin rallied 4.9% to $65,955.68. The cryptocurrency fell for three straight days through Friday.</p><p>* Merck slipped 1.6%, extending losses incurred last week when Pfizer said preliminary data showed its Covid-19 pill was effective in preventing severe illness. Merck's own coronavirus pill was cleared for use in the U.K. last week.</p><p>* The infrastructure bill's passage boosted raw-material and equipment companies such as Steel Dynamics, whose stock was already on a tear before the House approved the roughly $1 trillion legislation Friday. Nucor, Vulcan Materials and Astec Industries were among the other stocks benefiting from the prospect of spending on bridges and roads.</p><p>* Caterpillar shares gained 3.8%. Analysts at Credit Suisse, UBS and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets for the industrial-equipment maker after its quarterly profit more than doubled.</p><p>* Plug Power, shares of which are often volatile, rose 6.5%. The developer of hydrogen-fuel systems remains well below its high from early 2021, despite rallying 50% in the fourth quarter through Friday.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Tesla, Trade Desk, Peloton: What to Watch in the Stock Market Today</p>",
