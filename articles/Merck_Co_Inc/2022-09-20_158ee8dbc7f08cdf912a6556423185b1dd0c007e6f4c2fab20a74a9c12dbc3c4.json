  "title": "Outbreak of Rare Ebola Strain Declared in Uganda; Vaccines that have transformed the fight against Ebola haven't been tested on Sudan strain",
  "text": "<p>It is the first time in more than a decade that the Sudan strain has been detected in Uganda, which has experienced six previous outbreaks of Ebola, including three of the Sudan strain.</p><p>Eight other patients who are suspected of having Ebola are currently being treated in health facilities in Mubende, a forested farming district about 90 miles west of the capital Kampala, Dr. Atwine said. Health authorities are also investigating the deaths of six other people, including three children, in the village of the 24-year-old man dating back to early September.</p><p>Most known outbreaks of Ebola, including the 2014-2016 epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa, were caused by a different version of the virus, known as the Zaire strain.</p><p>The development of two vaccines against Ebola Zaire has in recent years helped contain multiple outbreaks, including in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea. The vaccines are given to healthcare workers and other people in proximity with patients, a process known as ring vaccination.</p><p>But the World Health Organization, which has dispatched supplies to Mubende, said Tuesday that the more widely used shot, Merck &amp; Co.'s Ervebo vaccine, hasn't been approved for use on the Sudan strain. The agency said another Ebola vaccine produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson may be effective but has yet to be tested against the Sudan strain.</p><p>Responders from Uganda's health ministry were dispatched Tuesday to Mubende and the WHO sent medical supplies to support the treatment of patients.</p><p>The health ministry said the 24-year-old man who died was initially treated for other illnesses, including diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia, and was admitted to three different clinics before he died at the regional referral hospital in Mubende. It isn't yet known how he became infected.</p><p>Scientists believe that Ebola was first passed on to humans by animals, such as primates or bats, and past outbreaks were usually considered new introductions of the virus from animals. In recent years, however, there have been multiple outbreaks that appear to have been caused by Ebola survivors inadvertently passing on the virus, likely through sexual intercourse, months or even years after clearing the initial infection.</p><p>Ebola spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of patients or contaminated materials through broken skin, the eyes, nose or mouth.</p><p>In the largest known Ebola outbreak in Uganda, the Ebola Sudan strain killed 224 of 425 people infected in 2000 and 2001. In 2019, Uganda quickly contained an outbreak of Ebola Zaire imported from neighboring Congo, where more than 2,000 patients died of the virus between 2018 and 2020.</p><p>\"Uganda is no stranger to effective Ebola control,\" said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's Africa director, on Tuesday. \"Thanks to its expertise, action has been taken to quicklyâ€¦detect the virus and we can bank on this knowledge to halt the spread of infections.\"</p><p>Write to Nicholas Bariyo at nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com</p><p>Outbreak of Rare Ebola Strain Declared in Uganda</p>",
