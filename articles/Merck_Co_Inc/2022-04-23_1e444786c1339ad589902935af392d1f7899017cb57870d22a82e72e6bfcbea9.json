  "text": "<p>The Biden administration's flagship “test to treat” plan to deal with Covid-19 over the coming months is failing because of key design flaws, experts are warning, as officials battle with a range of problems plaguing the next stage of the pandemic response.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the US president, unveiled the scheme as part of his State of the Union address earlier this year. It aims to ensure that people at high risk of severe illness, like the elderly and those with underlying conditions, receive antiviral pills as soon as they test positive, in an attempt to cut hospitalisations and deaths.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/18/1087380770/lifesaving-covid-drugs-are-sitting-unused-on-pharmacy-shelves-hhs-data-shows\">recent data</a> from the US health department shows half of the antiviral pills supplied to pharmacies are sitting unused, with many patients unaware of the scheme or unable to access it quickly enough.</p> <p>The lack of take-up is a significant problem for the Biden administration's Covid response, which is now relying less on mass vaccination drives and measures like social distancing to keep infections low, and instead focusing on keeping people out of hospital. </p> <p>It is one of a range of difficulties hampering the US pandemic effort just as cases begin to tick up again. They include delays to approving vaccines for young children and the recent legal judgment overturning the nationwide mask mandate for public transport.</p> <p>Mara Aspinall, a professor of biomedical diagnostics at Arizona State University, said: “Test to treat is exactly what we should be doing at this point. But the implementation simply has not worked. Lots of pharmacists don't even know it exists.”</p> <p>Biden announced the scheme earlier this year as part of a broader reset of the administration's Covid policies. The aim is to encourage people who suspect they might have Covid and are at high risk to test in a pharmacy, and if they test positive, immediately receive and fill a prescription for antiviral pills such as those made by Pfizer or Merck.</p> <p>Pfizer's Paxlovid pills <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16796f92-5845-4b83-8e96-39d5c2fd13ea\">have been shown</a> to cut hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients by nearly 90 per cent, but work best if given within three days of the onset of symptoms.</p> <p>The Biden administration has handed out hundreds of thousands of courses of the treatments to pharmacies to give out for free, but the latest figures from the health department suggest half of those have not been prescribed.</p> <p>Experts say there are multiple problems behind the lacklustre take-up. </p> <p>One is availability, especially in rural areas. According to the health department's website, there are only two test to treat locations in South Dakota, and three in North Dakota.</p> <p>Another is legal. While pills are handed out by pharmacists, they cannot actually write prescriptions in most states. Many pharmacists are sending patients to doctors for follow-up tests, which can sometimes take days to complete, thereby missing the window during which the antiviral pills are most effective.</p> <p>Finally, as Americans learn to live with the disease, testing numbers are far lower than they were. There are now<a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_newtestresultsreported\"> an average of 600,000 tests</a> being done in the US every day, down from a peak of 2.5mn earlier this year.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9542619.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Ezekiel Emanuel, a medical professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Covid adviser to Biden, said: “Tests are not being done as much as they were, and what testing is happening is happening at home, not at medical centres.”</p> <p>A senior administration official said: “The administration is finalising plans to allow every pharmacy that wants to order Paxlovid directly from the federal government. This would build on the 20,000 current locations across the country where Paxlovid is already available.”</p> <p>But the White House says that to improve uptake it needs more money, which has so far been refused by Congress. Karine Jean-Pierre, the deputy press secretary at the White House, said earlier this week: “We need funding to sustain our progress, and are actively working beyond these actions to increase uptake.”</p> <p>While the White House lobbies Capitol Hill for more money for vaccines and treatments, it is also tackling other problems with its Covid response.</p> <p>Earlier this week, a judge in Florida ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had acted illegally by requiring for those on public transport to wear masks. The administration is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f18e7af-6d60-41f3-9218-532c217ffebc\">no longer enforcing that mandate</a> while it appeals against the decision through the courts.</p> <p>The government is also coming under fire for not moving more quickly to approve vaccines for children under five. The Food and Drug Administration had hoped to give the go-ahead to vaccinate young children earlier this year but is now reported to be <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/21/biden-kids-vaccine-covid-00026798\">aiming for June at the earliest</a> after officials became concerned with how effective they had proved in trials.</p> <p>The FDA said in a statement: “Our approach has always been to conduct a regulatory review that's responsive to the urgent public health needs created by the pandemic, while adhering to our rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness.”</p> <p>So far the problems do not appear to be taking a political toll on Biden himself. According to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/390953/biden-job-rating-tepid-covid-russia-handling.aspx\">a poll</a> released on Friday by the pollster Gallup, the public approval rating for the president's Covid response has risen 6 percentage points in the last month to 53 per cent.</p> <p>But experts say that with cases having risen by over a third since the beginning of April, the administration's pandemic policies are likely to be tested again in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation think-tank, said: “As cases have come down since the Omicron surge, people have begun to feel like it is time to move on. </p> <p>“But now cases are ticking up again, especially in the north-east of the country, and the evidence shows that the administration is having challenges in getting its policies implemented and its message across.”</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2022 '‘Test to treat' chaos is latest setback for US Covid pandemic response' FT.com 23 April.
