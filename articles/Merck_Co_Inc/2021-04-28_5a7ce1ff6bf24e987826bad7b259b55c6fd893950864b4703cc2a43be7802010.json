Christopher Garrison, a research affiliate who is </em><a href=\"https://medicineslawandpolicy.org/2021/04/ensuring-that-intellectual-property-rights-arent-a-barrier-to-scaling-up-the-remarkable-example-of-penicillin-production-in-the-united-states-during-world-war-ii/\"><em>researching the history of penicillin</em></a><em>, contributed</em></p> <p>The world is scrambling to find ways to ramp-up Covid-19 vaccine production. But the intellectual property, including the knowhow needed to increase yields and manufacturing, is held by a handful of pharmaceutical companies. And they are not sharing it with the world.</p> <p>It is not as if the tools are unavailable. Almost a year ago, the World Health Organization established the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/covid-19-technology-access-pool\">Covid-19 Technology Access Pool</a>, a mechanism to allow the sharing of IP, data and the technology needed to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines and other health technologies. But so far the pool remains empty. </p> <p>This looks increasingly untenable. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spno_e/spno7_e.htm\">has urged vaccine makers</a> to invest in manufacturing capacity and to share their technology knowhow with others. Some 175 former world leaders and Nobel laureates have also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43fd53f5-2b82-4e41-981c-8544a6ce996b\">written to President Joe Biden</a> demanding that the US support a global waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines.</p> <p>During a global health crisis, political leaders should not have to beg industry to share their IP and production knowhow. The world has been here before. During the second world war, a desperate need for the antibiotic penicillin was met through a concerted mobilisation of resources and visionary leadership.</p> <p>Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, and <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/penicillin-oxford-story\">its effectiveness against</a> disease-causing bacteria was demonstrated by researchers at Oxford university by 1941. The university decided not to patent its invention. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html#pharmaceutical-production\">researchers travelled to the US</a> to share their penicillium moulds in the hope of enlisting America's manufacturing resources. By June 1944, US pharmaceutical companies were producing some 100bn units of penicillin a month; at that stage, there were no patent barriers to mass production. Just a year later this had increased to 650bn units.</p> <p>Key to this success was the exchange of knowledge. The US War Production Board passed on what government researchers discovered to manufacturers, asking them to share any valuable scientific information or production expertise with each other in return. </p> <p>Critically, penicillin production was not confined to the west. The government of Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to produce penicillin domestically in India. Merck offered to help set up a production plant on commercial terms, <a href=\"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/84236/1/MPRA_paper_84236.pdf\">involving royalty payments</a> for 15 years. But the WHO and Unicef encouraged India to create a publicly owned research, training and production facility. The two agencies committed to supporting such a facility with funding, while the WHO provided the knowhow and technical training. Production began at scale at a publicly owned facility in Pune in 1955. Penicillin has saved, and is still saving, millions of lives around the world. </p> <p>If such history teaches us anything, it is that the decision about where Covid-19 vaccines are produced and by whom should not be in the hands of large pharmaceutical companies. These vaccines have been developed on the most part with massive public financing and should be global goods to benefit all of humanity.</p> <p>Mechanisms for sharing IP and knowledge, such as the WHO's C-tap and the <a href=\"https://medicinespatentpool.org/\">Medicines Patent Pool</a>, need to be made fully operational and properly funded. Governments should incentivise Covid-19 vaccine companies to help make these mechanisms work. If companies refuse to collaborate voluntarily, governments must use the power they have to ensure that vaccines are produced at scale and in different regions of the world for as long as is needed. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/30-03-2021-global-leaders-unite-in-urgent-call-for-international-pandemic-treaty\">The pandemic treaty</a>, to be discussed at the upcoming World Health Assembly in May, would be a good place to co-ordinate the effort. The clearheadedness of the governments and agencies that years ago made penicillin production possible can be held up as a model today.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Ellen 't Hoen 2021 'To vanquish Covid the world must get better at sharing' FT.com 28 April.
