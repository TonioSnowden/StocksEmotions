Riley Financial. “The 10 year Treasury has now broken through its technical resistance and things could get problematical.”</p><p>Grant said investors should be selling bonds, and using yield-paying exchange-traded and closed-end funds as income substitutes.</p><p>Yellen, meanwhile, warned that the Treasury Department is likely to exhaust extraordinary measures to keep from defaulting on its debt if Congress hasn't acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by Oct. 18.</p><p>Read: What happens if the U.S. defaults on its debt?</p><p>Energy markets are another source of concern, as Europe and Asia fight for natural-gas supplies.
