  "title": "U.S. News:  FDA Backs  Merck Pill  For Covid  Treatment  At Home  ----  By Jared S. Hopkins and Betsy McKay",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. regulators cleared use of a Covid-19 pill from Merck &amp; Co. and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, the latest easy-to-use therapy that infected people can take to keep out of the hospital. </p><p>   The authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration permits doctors to prescribe the drug, molnupiravir, to adults at high risk of severe disease shortly after they develop mild to moderate symptoms. </p><p>   The FDA recommended using the Merck drug only if other authorized drugs aren't available and medically appropriate. Health experts have raised safety concerns about the Merck drug, which also was less effective in testing than an antiviral from Pfizer Inc. On Wednesday, the FDA cleared the Pfizer pill, Paxlovid, also for people to take at home to try to stay out of the hospital. </p><p>   Merck's drug was found to be 30% effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in a key study, while Pfizer said Paxlovid was 89% effective at reducing risk of hospitalization and death in a key study. Both drugs were tested before the Omicron variant emerged. The addition of the pills may bolster the fight against Omicron. Researchers have said they expect the drugs to work against the new strain, though they are waiting for study results. </p><p>   Molnupiravir \"will be a useful treatment option for some patients with Covid-19 at high risk of hospitalization or death,\" said Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's drugs division. </p><p>   With a molnupiravir prescription, adults would take eight pills daily for five days, starting within five days of showing symptoms. The FDA didn't authorize use among people who are hospitalized or under the age of 18. </p><p>   Some health experts have raised safety concerns and whether molnupiravir might cause mutations in cells that are harmful to people. Merck and Ridgeback have said the drug is safe, and testing in humans found it didn't cause mutations. </p><p>   The FDA has said its own review of the companies' data found no major safety concerns in late-stage testing. The FDA also found the treatment presented a low risk of mutation, known as mutagenicity. </p><p>   But the FDA's authorization of molnupiravir was for a more limited set of people than Paxlovid's, which was cleared for use in people 12 years and older who aren't taking a drug that could react to the treatment regimen. </p><p>   The FDA recommended against prescribing molnupiravir to anyone pregnant unless the benefits outweigh the risks because testing in animals indicated the drug could cause fetal harm. </p><p>   Molnupiravir is an option for patients who shouldn't take Paxlovid because one of the components of Paxlovid can have negative interactions with certain non-Covid medications that patients are taking, FDA officials said. </p><p>   \"This was a challenging benefit-risk consideration,\" John Farley, director of the FDA's Office of Infectious Diseases, said about the agency's review of Merck's drug. </p><p>   Another issue with molnupiravir, FDA officials said, is the potential risk that it could lead to variants of the virus developing in patients taking the drug, which might then escape and be transmitted to others. But FDA officials said the drug reduces viral loads, and patients should be isolating while undergoing treatment, which could mitigate this potential risk. </p><p></p>",
