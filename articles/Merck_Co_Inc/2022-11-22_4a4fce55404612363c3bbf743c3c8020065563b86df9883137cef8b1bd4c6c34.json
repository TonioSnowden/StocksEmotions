  "title": "Japan Approves First Homegrown Covid-19 Antiviral Pill; Osaka-based Shionogi is seeking U.S. approval for the drug, called Xocova",
  "text": "<p>Osaka-based Shionogi filed in February for emergency approval for the drug, known as Xocova, in Japan. The health ministry panel said in July it needed to see results from a larger human trial because data submitted at the time didn't sufficiently show improvements in symptoms associated with Covid-19.</p><p>Shionogi's recent data showed that those who were given the drug once a day for five days recovered from symptoms including fever and cough 24 hours faster than those who received a placebo. Shionogi's pill is designed to be taken once a day without any additional medication.</p><p>While the drugs from Pfizer and Merck have been cleared for use for high-risk patients in the U.S., Shionogi's trials showed improvements among lower-risk patients, the company said.</p><p>Shionogi has said it is in talks with the FDA and is carrying out global clinical trials.</p><p>\"We will continue to make efforts to provide this new option of treatment to, first people in Japan, and many countries in need of this medication,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>The Shionogi drug inhibits an enzyme that the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 needs to replicate. It has a similar mechanism to the Pfizer drug.</p><p>In October, Fujifilm Holdings Corp., said it was giving up on its antiviral drug Avigan to treat Covid-19 after its application for approval in Japan was rejected in December 2020 due to a lack of sufficient data.</p><p>Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com</p><p>Japan Approves First Homegrown Covid-19 Antiviral Pill</p>",
