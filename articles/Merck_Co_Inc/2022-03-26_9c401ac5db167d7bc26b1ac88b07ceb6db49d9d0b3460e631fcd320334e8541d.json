  "text": "<p>Congressional Map</p><p>A Maryland judge blocked the state's congressional map, saying the plan violated the state's constitution and was drawn \"to suppress the voice of Republican voters.\"</p><p>Judge Lynne A. Battaglia struck down the map of U.S. congressional districts in an opinion issued Friday, saying it violated requirements for compactness and didn't give due regard to political subdivisions. She also said the plan violated free elections, equal protection and free-speech clauses in the state's constitution.</p><p>Judge Battaglia ordered the Democratic-controlled state legislature to draw a new map.</p><p>\"In many respects, all of the testimony in this case supports the notions that the voice of Republican voters was diluted and their right to vote and be heard with the efficacy of a Democratic voter was diminished,\" wrote Judge Battaglia in Anne Arundel County.</p><p>Maryland has seven Democratic members of the U.S. House and one Republican member. In December, the Democratic-controlled Maryland General Assembly overrode Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's veto of the state's new congressional map, which turned the state's lone district held by a Republican into a competitive seat. That map gave Democrats the prospect of sweeping all eight of the state's U.S. House seats.</p><p>-- Alexa Corse</p><p>---</p><p>COVID-19</p><p>FDA Limits Use of</p><p>Glaxo Antibody Drug</p><p>U.S. health regulators restricted the use of GlaxoSmithKline PLC's Covid-19 treatment in Massachusetts, New York and several other states after finding that the drug is unlikely to be effective against the new version of the Omicron variant.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the antibody treatment sotrovimab from Glaxo and partner Vir Biotechnology Inc. is no longer cleared for use in Northeastern states, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, where the BA.2 subvariant is dominant.</p><p>Recent testing indicated that the therapy probably wouldn't work against the BA.2 subvariant, Vir and Glaxo said.</p><p>The FDA said doctors could instead give Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid, Gilead Sciences Inc.'s Veklury, Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s bebtelovimab, and molnupiravir, from Merck &amp; Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, to people with mild or moderate Covid-19 who are at high risk of severe disease.</p><p>Vir and Glaxo developed sotrovimab with the hope that it would work against all coronavirus variants, including new ones that emerge over time. The antibody targets a part of the virus that tends to remain even as the virus mutates, the companies have said.</p><p>Sotrovimab was one of the few antibody treatments that had worked against the earlier version of the Omicron variant, and many doctors and patients sought it out during the recent surge.</p><p>The companies said Friday that they plan to provide regulators with data showing that a higher dose of sotrovimab than currently authorized could be used against the BA.2 subvariant.</p><p>-- Jared S. Hopkins</p><p>---</p><p>SUPREME COURT</p><p>Pentagon's Vaccine</p><p>Mandate Allowed</p><p>The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration Friday in a dispute with Navy personnel who defied orders to vaccinate against Covid-19 on religious grounds. Three conservative justices dissented.</p><p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin added Covid-19 to the mandatory inoculation list in August.</p><p>Thirty-five members of the Naval Special Warfare Command requested exemptions but were denied. The members sued, asserting religious-exercise rights under federal law, and in January a federal district judge in Fort Worth, Texas, issued a preliminary order preventing the Pentagon from taking action against the personnel.</p><p>A federal appeals court in New Orleans rejected the Pentagon's request to lift that order. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the government said that mandatory vaccination has been a condition of service throughout U.S. history, beginning in 1777 \"when George Washington directed the inoculation of the Continental Army against smallpox.\"</p><p>While litigation continues, Friday's unsigned order restores the Navy's power to consider vaccination status when \"making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions\" regarding the service members.</p><p>Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented.</p><p>-- Jess Bravin</p>",
