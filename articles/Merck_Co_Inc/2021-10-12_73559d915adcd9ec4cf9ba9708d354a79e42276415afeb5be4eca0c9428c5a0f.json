  "text": "<p>The Food and Drug Administration could clear the antiviral in the coming weeks and possibly in time for what some public-health experts say could be another virulent winter, especially among people who aren't vaccinated.</p><p>\"The extraordinary impact of this pandemic demands that we move with unprecedented urgency, and that is what our teams have done by submitting this application for molnupiravir to the FDA within 10 days of receiving the data,\" Merck Chief Executive Robert Davis said.</p><p>Unlike Covid-19 vaccines and some other drugs for the disease that target the spike protein, molnupiravir works by targeting a part of the virus that helps it reproduce.</p><p>Doctors and patients have been waiting for an effective pill that would be easy to take at home, with the goal of preventing a case from requiring hospitalization.</p><p>Antibody drugs, like one from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc ., have been authorized for use in Covid-19 patients before they are hospitalized. These drugs have shown to be more effective in clinical trials, but they require infusions and are tougher to administer.</p><p>The Merck-Ridgeback pill, if authorized, would be the first oral antiviral for Covid-19. A course of treatment is 40 pills, eight daily for five days, started within five days of showing symptoms. The companies have said that the rate of side effects in study subjects who got molnupiravir and those who got a placebo was similar.</p><p>The findings were based on an early look at the data from a pivotal trial that is scheduled to finish in November.</p><p>Merck plans to manufacture 10 million courses of treatment by the end of the year and has already begun production. The Kenilworth, N.J.-based drugmaker has a $1.2 billion deal with the U.S. to provide 1.7 million courses of treatment, should regulators authorize it.</p><p>Merck also has said it would make molnupiravir available globally and has licensing agreements with generic drugmakers, including Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd . and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd .</p>",
