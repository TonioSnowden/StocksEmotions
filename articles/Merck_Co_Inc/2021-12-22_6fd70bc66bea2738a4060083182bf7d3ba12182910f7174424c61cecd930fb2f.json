  "text": "<p>France has cancelled its order for Merck's antiviral tablet, becoming the first country to do so publicly as concerns over the drug's efficacy against coronavirus continue to mount.</p> <p>Merck said it was “very confident” in the drug's clinical profile and that it was moving with “urgency” to bring molnupiravir to the world.</p> <p>Olivier Véran, France's health minister, told BFM TV that France had cancelled the order “because the last studies weren't good . . . It cost us nothing,” Reuters reported.</p> <p>Merck's drug — which the company has outlicensed to the Medicines Patent Pool to increase supply to poorer nations — had initially shown a reduction of about 50 per cent in the risk of hospitalisation and death. But complete data, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5991288f-7e62-4de4-9d41-88285d29ee62\">released last month</a>, showed that the fall was in fact about 30 per cent, significantly lower.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the UK, which is running a molnupiravir trial with at-risk patients, said it had <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-secures-millions-more-antivirals-to-help-fight-omicron\">expanded its order </a>by 1.75m additional courses of the drug. It had previously ordered 480,000 courses.</p> <p>Merck said it had supply agreements with over 30 countries. The European Medicines Agency has begun a full review of the drug after giving it an emergency nod — not an approval — that allows member states to go ahead with its use on a national basis. The results of that review are expected early next year.</p> <p>A person familiar with the EMA's approval process told the Financial Times the drug had been “a bit of a disappointment” and that 30 per cent efficacy “started to be on the limits of [what is considered] benefit”. The EMA pointed to previous remarks that the full data would be considered in the coming weeks “to determine if a positive opinion can be reached next year”, but declined to comment further.</p> <p>France's drug regulator earlier this month refused early access to the drug, saying, <a href=\"https://www.has-sante.fr/jcms/p_3304161/fr/covid-19-deux-nouveaux-traitements-evalues-par-la-has\">among other things</a>, that it did not meet standards for innovation, that its study results were worse than for treatments already available, and that its impact on viral loads — how much of the virus is present in the body — had not been demonstrated. </p> <p>Molnupiravir was developed by Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics.</p> <p>A US Food and Drug Administration panel last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1e3fc1b-06d2-4872-bc1d-7e3116d009a0\">narrowly voted in favour of approval</a>, saying its use should be restricted to high-risk adults with mild to moderate symptoms amid concerns about side-effects. The FDA has not yet communicated its decision.</p> <p>It is not clear yet whether other European countries have privately cancelled orders, though most are betting on Pfizer's paxlovid, another oral drug <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe6308a-e26b-40a5-ae7b-75939b232b93#post-c2341122-1c4d-401a-af4a-80f0b9abb917\">approved by the FDA on Wednesday</a>, which has shown an 89 per cent reduction in hospitalisations or deaths, to help manage a surge in cases.</p> <p>France had also acted early on remdesivir, the Gilead drug whose benefit has been described as limited, restricting its use before others did.</p> <p>Andy Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in pharmacology at the University of Liverpool, said trial results for the drug “do not show statistically significant benefits over placebo in a simple sensitivity analysis. Several academics are finding the same results.”</p> <p>He said the downward revision of efficacy was a “very unusual result” that needed further investigation.</p> <p>The Merck trial, he noted, had recruited elderly unvaccinated patients. </p> <p>“In the UK, the vast majority of elderly patients have already been double-vaccinated,” he said. “This lowers their risks of hospitalisation. So it is not clear if molnupiravir can benefit these patients any more.”</p> <p>Merck said it continued to work with the EMA on its review and would continue negotiations on supply should the drug be authorised or approved.</p><p>Source: Donato Paolo Mancini in London 2021 'France cancels order for Merck antiviral tablet on efficacy fears' FT.com 22 December.
