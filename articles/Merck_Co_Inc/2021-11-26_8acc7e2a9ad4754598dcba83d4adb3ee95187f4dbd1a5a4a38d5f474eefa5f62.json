  "text": "<p>News of yet another coronavirus strain rattled traders on Friday. Both Asian and especially European stock markets tumbled following reports of African cases from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ca4536-07b2-463f-bb44-8159aaec89ab\">another variant</a>, appropriately tagged “Nu”. US shares duly followed suit later in the day.</p> <p>The news splashed cold water on the market exuberance propping up stock markets around the world. Inflation fretters will puzzle over Brent prices collapsing 6 per cent. </p> <p>This year, a rally in energy commodities has fomented global inflation worries. So much so that the two largest energy consumers, the US and China, this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e7f2590-1a4f-4792-9e64-eafabdef6534\">jointly released oil </a>from their respective strategic reserves to encourage Opec to raise its output. But until seasonally low global inventories pick up, Opec may well choose to ignore this pressure from consuming nations.</p> <p>The value of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25171824-8b4f-4358-a91b-876745e9a6c7\">travel-related stocks</a> rightly plummeted. New restrictions on flights from southern African nations will worry those hoping to travel abroad anywhere soon. Yet, share prices of European airlines and other travel-related groups, such as Accor and Tui, have performed poorly since this summer. Rising Covid-19 cases on the continent in the past month will have weighed on their shares. Still, quite a few still hit new 52-week share price lows on the day. </p> <p>US pharma group Merck picked a bad day to report <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5991288f-7e62-4de4-9d41-88285d29ee62?\">disappointing updated data</a> for its new Covid antiviral pill. Most healthcare stocks did well including Pfizer, maker of a rival pill. Pfizer, alongside BioNTech, is key to coping with the new variant. They can ship a new version of their vaccine within 100 days if needed. </p> <p>Regardless, investors are mulling the possibility of strict restrictions returning. Shares in Germany's HelloFresh jumped 5 per cent and approach record highs. Lockdowns in its main markets should mean more demand for its meal kits.</p> <p>The risk of a drop in stock prices was high during a week that included a big US holiday. Even without a new variant, investors had already begun to question the longevity of the pandemic bull run.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Coronavirus: new variant cools inflation embers' FT.com 26 November.
