  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Breakup Is No Clean Sweep; Tepid market reaction to separation of consumer unit shows Johnson & Johnson still has work ahead to convince shareholders",
  "text": "<p>While there is logic to the separation, it is no home run. For one thing, J&amp;J shares aren't obviously undervalued at around 16 times forward earnings, according to FactSet. Large, stand-alone pharmaceutical companies actually tend to trade for less. Merck &amp; Co., for instance, is valued at just 12 times— a reflection of the massive investments that are needed to stay ahead of patent expirations and other challenges.</p><p>These days, consumer-facing healthcare companies tend to fetch more: Reckitt Benckiser, owner of the Mucinex and Clearasil brands, is valued at around 21 times forward earnings.</p><p>In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Joe Wolk argued J&amp;J's premium to other pharma companies is due to its superior execution in that business and that it still \"gets no credit\" in its multiple for the consumer division. \"When we have an investor day, we get no coverage there,\" he said of the division with $15 billion a year in sales. This suggests that hiving it off would create shareholder value by unlocking a higher multiple.</p><p>Perhaps, but makers of these kinds of branded consumer healthcare products face many long-term challenges that the pandemic has only temporarily papered over, putting their premium valuations at risk. This includes the shift to e-commerce distribution, which helps enable smoother price comparisons against unbranded alternatives to brands like Tylenol.</p><p>J&amp;J is well aware of this. Indeed, the need to focus on industry trends like changing consumer distribution is one of its stated reasons for the spinoff. Mr. Wolk also stresses that the consumer business has seen 50% growth in e-commerce sales over the past couple of years.</p><p>At the same time, J&amp;J is ditching its faith in the strategic benefits of diversification—something analysts questioned on Friday during the company's call. The consumer business, for instance, helped J&amp;J weather a pandemic-driven disruption in medical-device sales as patients deferred certain kinds of care.</p><p>Now the company has to demonstrate to shareholders that it is worth trading away that cushion. Strong execution from a newly focused consumer unit might be the only way to make the case.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Breakup Is No Clean Sweep</p>",
