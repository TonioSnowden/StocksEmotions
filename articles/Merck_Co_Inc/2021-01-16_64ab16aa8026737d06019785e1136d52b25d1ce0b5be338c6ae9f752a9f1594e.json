  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Companies Are Making Politics Their Business --- 'We are committed to action,' wrote one CEO",
  "text": "<p>\"Words alone are not enough. We are committed to action,\" wrote Dow Inc. CEO Jim Fitterling in a memo telling employees that the chemical maker was halting political giving to any Republicans who objected to certifying President-elect Joe Biden's win for an election cycle -- two years for House members and up to six for senators.</p><p>It was a far cry from the days when companies strove to appear apolitical, embodying -- if not always living up to -- the late economist Milton Friedman's view that \"the business of business is business.\"</p><p>\"We're seeing a convergence of social issues that used to be outside the domain of what business executives would comment on,\" said Judy Samuelson, founder and executive director of the Business and Society Program at the Aspen Institute, a think tank, and author of \"The Six New Rules of Business,\" which addresses such shifts. \"The rule of thumb was if there's not a direct connection back to our business model or something that we hold dear, it's basically we stay away from politics.\"</p><p>Some corporate reaction undoubtedly reflected genuine dismay. The day after the riot, Snap-on Inc. CEO Nicholas T. Pinchuk flew to a plant in Murphy, N.C., where he walked the floor to check in with employees, many of whom have been Trump supporters. Some workers were jarred by the Washington turmoil, he said, while others were disappointed in Mr. Trump; some were both.</p><p>\"I don't know how many head shakes and eyerolls I got,\" Mr. Pinchuk said. \"You got the feeling that the president lost them in the last four to six weeks.\"</p><p>But broader shifts that have drawn companies into politics are in play, too. In recent decades, the center of corporate America has moved from Midwestern manufacturers to coastal technology-oriented companies, where workforces and leaders often have a more socially liberal, even activist bent.</p><p>Silicon Valley CEOs like Salesforce.com Inc.'s Marc Benioff, Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk and Adobe Inc.'s Shantanu Narayen have publicly taken stances on issues such as gay rights, climate change and immigration matters. Many business leaders across industries have also condemned racism in the U.S. and pledged to do better in their own organizations following racial-justice protests this summer.</p><p>In a more politicized, divided era, employees -- along with shareholders, customers and media outlets -- have social media at their fingertips to air grievances or exert pressure. Leaders are constantly balancing expectations that they speak up on a range of issues with the risks of doing so.</p><p>\"There is a business risk to speaking out, and it's difficult sometimes to know just how fickle some stakeholders might be,\" said Rebecca L. Ray, an executive vice president of human capital at the Conference Board, a private nonpartisan research group. \"You could be celebrated for something one week and pilloried the next, so it is a land mine for folks.\"</p><p>Andrew Liveris, an International Business Machines Corp. director and former CEO of Dow Chemical Co. -- he stepped down in 2018 after its combination with DuPont Co. -- said the Capitol riot accelerated CEOs' speaking out on a range of issues but that they needed to think about the right long-term messages.</p><p>\"When you get to lofty positions like being CEO and having the responsibility to lead, whatever the role is, you've got to basically know I'm going to get tested here, or maybe some of my constituents won't like what I have to say,\" said Mr. Liveris, an Australian citizen who has donated to Republicans and Democrats. \"We're going to find it a little messy, everybody is not going to agree.\"</p><p>The White House declined to comment on recent statements from CEOs and companies cutting ties with Mr. Trump. Spokesmen for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee declined to comment on companies pausing corporate PAC donations to certain Republican lawmakers. In a video after the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump on Wednesday, the president said his movement has no room for mob violence and asked followers to ease tensions ahead of the inauguration. Representatives for Mr. Hawley didn't respond to requests to comment; he wrote on Twitter that the publisher's decision was \"a direct assault on the First Amendment.\" Most companies named in this article pointed to past statements saying recent events led to their decisions, didn't respond to inquiries or declined to comment publicly</p><p>The full consequences of such moves remain unclear. Hallmark Cards Inc. faced immediate blowback on social media after it sought to claw back political donations made to Mr. Hawley through its PAC -- angering some on the right for a move seen as anti-Republican, and some on the left for donating to Republicans in the first place.</p><p>Skeptics about the swell of activism include Michael Leven, a former president of Las Vegas Sands Corp. \"They're all knee-jerk reactions, and some of them are moral and ethical, and some of them are for positioning purposes and economic purposes,\" he said. Companies' public breaks with Republican lawmakers and Mr. Trump risk little when another party is poised to take control, he added.</p><p>Though some CEOs have acted against those they see as contributing to the riot that left five people dead, just a small number have called for Mr. Trump's ouster. Many others are staying quiet, opting to sit tight at least until Mr. Biden takes office next week.</p><p>Action on political giving might have muted effects, as businesses overall have limited their political donations in recent years. An increasing share of Democrat and Republican fundraising comes from online donors and outside groups funded in large part by a small group of billionaire donors.</p><p>\"The interest of business is to stabilize the political arena, not to further disrupt it,\" said Kathryn Wylde, head of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit representing more than 100 of the city's business leaders and largest employers that has put out two letters urging Congress for a peaceful transition of power.</p><p>At Blackstone Group Inc., CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, a loyal Trump ally in business and a major Republican fundraiser, waited about two weeks after election results to publicly acknowledge that Mr. Trump lost. His name was absent from a Jan. 4 letter signed by roughly 200 CEOs urging Congress to certify the Electoral College results.</p><p>Mr. Schwarzman, who sits on the Partnership for New York City executive committee, signed neither the January letter nor a late-November missive because he believed his association with Mr. Trump had come to dog him, according to people familiar with the decisions. Blackstone President Jonathan Gray, a Democrat, signed both letters.</p><p>A Blackstone spokesman said: \"Steve has also made very clear, individual public statements about both Joe Biden's victory in the November election and the insurrection on January 6.\" Mr. Schwarzman issued a statement after the riot, saying: \"The insurrection that followed the president's remarks today is appalling and an affront to the democratic values we hold dear as Americans.\"</p><p>Hours after the Partnership letter's release, other corporate plans took shape, with leaders concluding that letters weren't enough as lawmakers said they were objecting to the Electoral College results.</p><p>On Tuesday, Jan. 5, about three dozen CEOs joined an hour-long video call to discuss ways to ensure a peaceful transition of power, said attendees. In the meeting, some who donated to Republican campaigns said they were considering withholding political contributions to elected officials who planned to oppose certifying the results on Jan. 6. Some executives said in the meeting that they would also reconsider hiring and investments in states where officials were questioning election results.</p><p>\"We have to create some level of cost,\" argued Thomas Glocer, a former CEO of Thomson Reuters Corp., and a director at Merck &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, who attended the meeting. Mr. Glocer, a registered Democrat, said he has voted for candidates in both parties, adding: \"Just coming out with another public letter isn't going to do much. Money is the key way.\"</p><p>The session ended with executives watching a \"Saturday Night Live\" parody of the conservative news channel Newsmax TV, which had promoted some of Mr. Trump's false election claims. The sketch imagined Newsmax-branded sports programming, with commentators claiming the New York Jets won games despite finishing with lower scores than opponents.</p><p>Just after 2 p.m. the next day, a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters smashed glass and pushed their way past police to storm the Capitol as senators were debating an objection to Mr. Biden's Electoral College win.</p><p>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky was in his upstate New York hometown when his father, watching CNN, called him over, said people familiar with his action. Mr. Chesky contacted his head of policy, putting in motion a plan that ultimately banned individuals believed to have participated in criminal activity at the Capitol. Airbnb later said it would also cancel Washington-area bookings during Inauguration Week and prevent new ones, citing concerns about additional violence.</p><p>The National Association of Manufacturers issued a statement condemning the mayhem and calling on Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump. \"This is sedition and should be treated as such,\" the group's president, Jay Timmons, said in the statement, which sent a shock through its roughly 14,000 company members.</p><p>NAM board member Nicole Wolter, CEO of HM Manufacturing Inc. in Wauconda, Ill., said she read the statement in surprise. \"I was like, 'Yikes.' The second time I read it, I understood where he's coming from,\" she said. \"This needed to be condemned.\"</p><p>Lisa Winton, a NAM board member and CEO of Winton Machine Co. in Suwanee, Ga., said she emailed Mr. Timmons supporting the statement. She said she didn't have an opinion on the call to remove Mr. Trump. Ms. Winton said she and her workers in Georgia are exhausted by politics after the long 2020 race and the political-ad blitz leading up to the state's Jan. 5 Senate runoffs.</p><p>\"No matter who's in office, we need their attention,\" she said of lawmakers, citing small-business loans, job training and solving the Covid-19 crisis as top issues. \"We need them to focus on what's important.\"</p><p>Canadian e-commerce company Shopify Inc. took stores run by Mr. Trump's business and campaign offline. PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing the risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump; the Trump Organization has said the PGA decision was a \"breach of a binding contract.\"</p><p>Crowell &amp; Moring LLP Chairman Phil Inglima said the law firm asked about 200 top law firms to sign a statement in support of removing Mr. Trump. Eighteen other law-firm leaders and dozens of individual lawyers signed on. Several of the largest firms declined, with some saying they saw the statement as too political, said people familiar with their decisions.</p><p>Crowell &amp; Moring sent the statement to Vice President Pence on Jan. 8. \"We don't view this as a political act at all,\" Mr. Inglima said. \"We view this as a defense of the Constitution.\"</p><p>By Sunday, companies including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Boston Scientific Corp., said they were pausing their political-action committee donations for Republicans and Democrats. Some of the suspensions won't have much impact because the 2022 election cycle won't start for at least six months.</p><p>Some resisted the tide. CEOs who say they didn't plan to change their funding include Paul Sarvadi of Insperity Inc., a publicly traded HR company in Texas, who has donated to Republicans. \"I'm not thinking about that at this point,\" he said. \"I think it pays for companies to be more deliberate, less reactive.\"</p><p>By Monday, Jan. 11, more than 40 large companies had said they were reviewing or suspending corporate PAC donations.</p><p>By then, many businesses were looking ahead to this weekend, when more demonstrations are planned across the country, according to law enforcement. On a Zoom call, about 40 CEOs met to discuss the political uncertainty, according to attendees. Executives talked about the threat of violence in Washington and elsewhere, with CEOs sharing plans to tighten security and step up monitoring of company facilities, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who convened the meeting.</p><p>IBM on Friday released a slate of \"good government reforms,\" that include updating the presidential-transition process and reiterating its calls for police reform, besides policies, such as financial disclosure laws, that may directly impact its business. \"What companies should be thinking about is policy reforms, not PAC checks,\" IBM wrote.</p><p>Many business leaders said they were hopeful the new White House would address issues such as federal action on the economy and combating Covid-19. \"Clients across all industries want us to have some return to normalcy,\" said Blair Effron, a Democratic fundraiser who co-leads investment bank Centerview Partners LLC.</p><p>Home Depot Inc. co-founder Ken Langone, now retired, had previously aligned himself with Mr. Trump. He told CNBC on Wednesday he felt betrayed by the president, vowing to help make Mr. Biden as successful as possible.</p><p>\"My loyalty is to my presidency. My loyalty is to the public officials that run to serve us,\" he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"I find a lot of things I don't like about Joe Biden, but that's besides the point. It's in my selfish interest for him to be very successful.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Austen Hufford contributed to this article.</p>",
