  "text": "<p>Berenberg upgraded both Roche and Merck &amp; Co MRK to Buy from Hold. The bank downgraded Bristol-Myers BMY and Novartis CH:NOVN to Hold from Buy. The team retained its Buy recommendations on AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and GSK UK:GSK.</p><p>AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have weathered the uncertain macroeconomic market and garnered investor attention since the start of the year, the analyst team said in a Wednesday note.</p><p>In contrast, competitors GSK and Sanofi's FR:SAN stocks took a significant hit due to concerns swirling around its case on Zantac. Berenberg estimates both stocks losing $12 billion of market cap each.</p><p>\"Throughout this year, growth names, such as AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have remained in favour. In the context of the wider market, we expect the relative simplicity of these stories to remain an attraction,\" said the team led by analyst Kerry Holford.</p><p>Pricing reform</p><p>Berenberg also pointed out the recent passing of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included provisions to mediate drug pricing, ultimately a negative action for the industry. The restructuring requires the pharma sector to fund 20% of drug costs above $2,000 out-of-pocket expense and price negotiation on mature drugs by Medicare.</p><p>\"For drugs at risk of price cuts from 2026-30, companies have less scope to adapt (via price increases, cost reduction or termination of R&amp;D),\" they explained.</p><p>\"For new drugs about to arrive on the market, new behaviours could be exhibited (delaying launch, raising launch prices, limiting investment).\"</p><p>Those companies which will pull through the downsides of the reform, the analysts say, are those who can \"regenerate their portfolios most effectively and replace maturing drugs with innovation,\" namely AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Roche.</p><p>Return on R&amp;D investment</p><p>In an updated note on return on R&amp;D investments, Berenberg said the average pharma giant is tracking to an average 10% return on investment (for the 2016-2022 pipeline cohort), against a cost of capital of 8%.</p><p>The highest average return was at Novo Nordisk, the lowest at Novartis.</p><p>The analysts identified the individual companies on track to deliver average returns (2016-22) above the cost of capital are Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, AbbVie ABBV, Roche and Merck &amp; Co.</p><p>Looking further back, Berenberg also evaluated the returns on investment made 10 years ago and found an average 9% return on R&amp;D.</p><p>Bristol-Myers topped the list with a return of 18% â€” driven by its drugs Eliquis, Opdivo and Yervoy.</p><p>AstraZeneca had the lowest return at 0% due to its failures for fostamatinib, lesinurad, Movantik and TC-5214.</p><p>AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Roche among pharmaceutical companies upgraded for high returns on R&amp;D investments, analysts say</p>",
