  "text": "<p>The result also helps validate the pharmaceutical industry's investment in a pricey new class of drugs that target cancer cells, known as PARP inhibitors.</p><p>AstraZeneca's pill, named Lynparza, has become one of the company's top sellers, generating $1.8 billion in sales last year. Rival GlaxoSmithKline PLC paid more than $5 billion in 2019 to acquire the maker of another PARP inhibitor, Tesaro.</p><p>Lynparza carries a U.S. list price of about $14,449 per patient monthly.</p><p>AstraZeneca plans to submit the data to regulators and request regulatory approval of the use of Lynparza for early-stage BRCA breast cancer, said David Fredrickson, executive vice president of AstraZeneca's oncology unit.</p><p>PARP inhibitors work by blocking cancer cells from relying on a survival tactic: the ability to repair their own DNA after their DNA is damaged naturally or by other drug treatments. This, in turn, contributes to cancer-cell death.</p><p>The drugs have been found to be particularly useful against cancers associated with harmful mutations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women with these hereditary mutations have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, and often at a younger age than is typical.</p><p>The BRCA mutations account for about 5% of the estimated 281,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in the U.S. Overall, breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in women, causing about 43,600 deaths in the U.S. annually, according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration cleared Lynparza, in 2018, to treat advanced-stage BRCA-mutated breast cancer.</p><p>The new study tested Lynparza in women at earlier stages of breast cancer, at a time when it is potentially curable. AstraZeneca sponsored the study and collaborated with Merck and various research groups that run breast-cancer clinical trials.</p><p>Starting in 2014, researchers in the U.S. and 22 other countries enrolled 1,836 women with early-stage BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer.</p><p>Before enrolling, the women had undergone surgery to remove tumors, and had received chemotherapy before or after surgery aimed at preventing a recurrence of the tumor. They were at high risk of recurrence based on the size of their tumors or presence of cancer in lymph nodes. The women also tested negative for the HER2 gene that is present in some breast cancers.</p><p>Half of the women in the study were randomly assigned to take Lynparza tablets daily for one year, while the other half got a placebo.</p><p>At a median follow-up period of 2 1/2 years after the start of treatment, Lynparza reduced the combined risk of recurrence of cancer or death from any cause by 42% compared with a placebo, the researchers found.</p><p>Researchers estimated that three years after the start of treatment, 85.9% of the women who received Lynparza were living without disease recurrence, compared with 77.1% of women who received a placebo.</p>",
