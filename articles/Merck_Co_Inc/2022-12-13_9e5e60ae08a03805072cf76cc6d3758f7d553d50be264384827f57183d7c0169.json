  "text": "<p>Moderna and Merck are preparing to launch the first phase 3 trial of a messenger RNA cancer vaccine after a study suggested it could be used to treat an aggressive type of skin cancer.</p> <p>Data released by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f6ea19e6-cb8f-452e-8d0d-4298e8f38c55\">Moderna</a> on Tuesday showed that a combination of the company's experimental cancer vaccine and Merck's immunotherapy drug Keytruda reduced the risk of death or recurrence of melanoma in high-risk patients by 44 per cent compared with treatment using only Keytruda.</p> <p>The phase 2 randomised trial enrolled 157 patients who had already undergone surgery related to melanoma and tracked them for a year. Some participants received nine doses of the cancer vaccine, codenamed mRNA-4157/V940, along with Keytruda. Others were given Keytruda alone, which is the standard treatment for high-risk melanoma.</p> <p>Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said the results had emboldened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/26a3df92-2884-4b89-b41b-a496f5f60750\">Merck</a> and Moderna to embark on a larger phase 3 trial that regulators tend to demand before approving a new treatment.</p> <p>The vast majority of drugs that succeed in phase 2 studies subsequently fail in the next stage of trials.</p> <p>The companies would also test the combination in other kinds of cancer. “We believe that this should work in many tumour types, not only melanoma,” Bancel said in an interview.</p> <p>Moderna shares surged as much as 25 per cent to $207.37 in early trading following the release of the results, while Merck shares were up almost 1 per cent. </p> <p>Scientists have long studied the potential of using mRNA technology — which is best known for being used successfully in Covid-19 jabs — to deliver a vaccine that teaches the body's immune system to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ef99d4-063a-4a45-ae4d-e8115a9c3bb1\">target cancer tumours</a>.</p> <p>Jeffrey Weber, principal investigator of the study and deputy director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone, said the findings provided the first randomised evidence that a personalised neoantigen vaccine approach could be beneficial in melanoma cases. Weber is a paid consultant for Merck and Moderna.</p> <p>However, some analysts urged caution, noting that Moderna had released only a small amount of trial data and the results had not yet been reviewed by independent scientists.</p> <p>Daina Graybosch, an analyst at SVB Securities, said the phase 2 results were impressive but a detailed readout of the results would be needed to bolster confidence that the success could be repeated in a larger trial. </p> <p>Julie Bauman, director of the cancer centre at George Washington University, said mRNA cancer vaccines were specifically tailored to target each individual's cancer.</p> <p>“You get the tissue from a tumour, sequence it and then over a six-week period of time you manufacture a vaccine that matches the top 10 to 20 mutations,” she said.</p> <p>Bauman said the vaccine stimulated a person's immune system to selectively target those cancer cells.</p> <p>The clinical trial forms part of a six-year collaboration between Merck and Moderna in the field of developing personalised cancer vaccines. In October, Merck agreed to pay Moderna $250mn to exercise an option to jointly develop and commercialise mRNA-4157/V940.</p> <p>Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the positive trial findings represented an important milestone in the company's collaboration with Moderna.</p> <p>“We look forward to advancing this programme into the next phase of development,” he said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Hannah Kuchler in London</em></p><p>Source: Jamie Smyth in New York  2022 'Moderna's mRNA cancer vaccine shows promise in early trial' FT.com 13 December.
