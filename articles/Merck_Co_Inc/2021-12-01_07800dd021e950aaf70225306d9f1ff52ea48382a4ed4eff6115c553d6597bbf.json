  "title": "Stock Futures, Oil Rise, Pointing to More Seesaw Moves on Omicron Uncertainty; Investors struggle to assess implications of coronavirus variant on business and economies",
  "text": "<p>The uncertainty has led to seesaw moves in global markets that extended into Wednesday. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, signaling gains for the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9% Tuesday, closing out a decline for November after a late-month dive sparked by the emergence of Omicron.</p><p>\"We just don't know how much more infectious it is, how severe the symptoms are and what the impact of that is,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"What I'd assume now is this probably isn't enough to derail the recovery that's going on.\"</p><p>Invesco's multiasset funds have bought stocks at cheaper levels since Omicron first rattled markets last week, Mr. Mackay added.</p><p>Technology stocks headed for a strong start to Wednesday's session as futures for the Nasdaq-100 added 1.3%. Contracts for the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%.</p><p>Ahead of the bell in New York, Merck shares rose 4.8% after scientific advisers recommended the Food and Drug Administration authorize the company's experimental Covid-19 oral antiviral. Salesforce.com fell 7.4% after the software company's guidance for fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.</p><p>In another snapback, Brent oil prices, which have tumbled on signs Omicron was curtailing demand for jet fuel, rose 4.3% to $72.17 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Wednesday and Thursday to determine its response to recent price declines. Analysts say the cartel, still holding back production in tandem with allies led by Russia, may pause plans to pump more oil in January, or further cut output.</p><p>One cause for concern, money managers say, is that the rapid pace of inflation could prevent the Fed and other central banks from unleashing stimulus in the event of severe disruption caused by Omicron. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added to those worries Tuesday when he opened the door to an interest-rate risein the first half of 2022.</p><p>For a reading on inflationary pressures, investors will parse the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect the survey to show factories experienced another month of strong new orders in November, but also rising prices and long waiting times for materials.</p><p>Wednesday's move back into riskier assets knocked the government bond market. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.500% from 1.440% Tuesday. Yields move inversely to bond prices.</p><p>Overseas markets gained. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%, led higher by shares of travel, leisure and basic-resource companies, which would all be exposed to an economic downturn. Strong performers included budget airline Wizz Air, up more than 6%, Deutsche Lufthansa, up 4.9%, and cruise operator Carnival, which gained 4.6%.</p><p>Winners from the stay-at-home trade fell. German food-delivery firm HelloFresh lost 4.3% and U.K.-listed takeout company Deliveroo shed 2.8%.</p><p>Asian markets were broadly higher. South Korea's Kospi added 2.1% while Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures, Oil Rise, Pointing to More Seesaw Moves on Omicron Uncertainty</p>",
