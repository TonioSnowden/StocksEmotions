  "title": "Merck's Patent Cliff Doesn't Look So Frightening Anymore; Merck could be sitting on a blockbuster from a recent acquisition that would help reduce dependence on cancer drug Keytruda",
  "text": "<p>The crown jewel of its $11.5 billion purchase last year of Acceleron Pharma, a drug for a rare type of high blood pressure known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), appeared to deliver positive results, potentially paving the way for a multibillion-dollar drug. Merck said Monday that the late-stage trial of Sotatercept for PAH met its primary endpoint, significantly extending how far patients could walk in six minutes compared with a placebo. The company added that eight of nine secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance. It didn't disclose detailed results, which will be presented at a coming conference.</p><p>Jared Holz, a healthcare-sector specialist at Oppenheimer, says any management team is going to be judged by how well their last major acquisition has fared. And right now, making smart deals is as important as ever for the industry because more than $200 billion in annual drug sales could face competition from generics later this decade as patent protection for top-selling medicines expires. \"The sector depends on business development in a way that it hasn't in a while,\" says Mr. Holz.</p><p>Merck is perhaps the company with one of the biggest holes to fill. Its top drug, Keytruda, is going off patent in 2028, at which point it is expected to have been generating north of $30 billion in sales, amounting to about 50% of the company's forecast revenue.</p><p>A key part of its strategy to replenish its product line is to rebuild its cardiovascular and pulmonary portfolio, for which Merck has set a target of eight approved drugs bringing in about $10 billion in sales in 2030. That is an ambitious goal that is by no means assured, but it is part of a broader trend as the heart-drug market makes a comeback. Drugmakers are investing in a generation of new products after many blockbuster drugs for things like blood pressure and cholesterol faced generic competition.</p><p>Sotatercept can't replace Keytruda alone, of course. If the drug is approved, Guggenheim analysts see it fetching sales of about $4 billion in 2031. But Sotatercept's success could help win investor trust in Chief Executive Rob Davis as his team looks for its next acquisition.</p><p>Merck has engaged in intensive talks to acquire biotechnology firm Seagen for about $40 billion in recent months, but it is unclear whether that deal has been called off. Several other biotechs, including Argenx, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Biogen could present attractive targets for Merck and other big pharma companies.</p><p>As in the case of Acceleron, it often takes some time for investors to know for certain if a deal will pan out. In the meantime, management teams need all the support they can get, and it helps when their most recent deal shows signs of panning out.</p><p>Write to David Wainer at david.wainer@wsj.com</p><p>Merck's Patent Cliff Doesn't Look So Frightening Anymore</p>",
