  "text": "<p>Pfizer Inc.'s first-quarter sales soared 77%, helped by higher revenue from its Covid-19 vaccine and antiviral medication.</p><p>The New York-based drug company logged $25.7 billion in sales in the first-quarter, driven by sales of its vaccine, Comirnaty, and Paxlovid, a pill aimed at reducing severe outcomes from the virus.</p><p>The revenue was higher than analysts expected, according to FactSet.</p><p>Direct sales of Comirnaty grew to $13.2 billion while Paxlovid brought in another $1.5 billion, having launched in the U.S. last December and internationally in late 2021 and earlier this year.</p><p>Excluding those two products, revenue increased by 2%. Sales of its pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar swelled 59% in the U.S. thanks to strong retail stocking and government purchases of the pediatric version.</p><p>The company said it is on track to deliver between $98 billion and $102 billion in revenue for the year, with $32 billion coming from Comirnaty and $22 billion from Paxlovid.</p><p>Last week, Merck &amp; Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. both reported strong sales growth tied to their Covid-19 treatments.</p><p>The company's net income rose to $7.86 billion for the quarter, up from $4.88 billion last year, while earnings rose 59% to $1.37 a share. Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings climbed 72% to $1.62. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $1.49 a share.</p><p>Despite the strong results, Pfizer trimmed its earnings forecast, reflecting an accounting-policy change that starts including all acquired in-process research and development expenses. It now expects per-share earnings between $6.25 and $6.45 a share, down 10 cents on each end of the range in its prior forecast.</p><p>Shares of Pfizer were down 1.5% in premarket trading.</p><p>Pfizer Sales Soar on Covid-19 Vaccine Sales</p>",
