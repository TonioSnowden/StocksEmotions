  "title": "Moderna's mRNA Cancer Vaccine Shows Promise in Preliminary Study; Shot combined with Merck immunotherapy reduced risk of relapse in people with skin cancer in study",
  "text": "<p>The results, which the companies said were statistically significant but haven't been reviewed by independent scientists, suggest promise for an emerging but unproven class of vaccines that aim to treat diseases rather than prevent infections like typical shots.</p><p>If the combination proves successful in further testing, the results could broaden the applications for Moderna'smessenger RNA platform beyond the Covid-19 vaccine that was the first commercial use for the gene-based technology.</p><p>It would also further catapult the company's rise up the ranks of the biggest biotechs from an unproven startup before the pandemic began.</p><p>Merck and Moderna said they plan to discuss the results with regulators and to run a larger study to confirm the combination's safety and efficacy next year. Positive results of that study could clear the way for potential regulatory approval of Moderna's experimental cancer vaccine.</p><p>Moderna and Merck also plan to test the combination in other types of cancers. \"We don't want to waste time. Given the data is so strong, for me it's a Covid-like moment,\" Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said.</p><p>The company's shares rose 19.6% Tuesday, adding about $12 billion to Moderna's market capitalization.</p><p>Established in 2010 to harness the potential of molecular advances, Moderna had worked for years to commercialize mRNA, facing technical hurdles such as getting mRNA to its target before the body broke it down.</p><p>The pandemic gave Moderna an opening to prove the technology's worth. Its Covid-19 shot helped validate mRNA vaccines, while generating tens of billions of dollars in sales for the company.</p><p>Moderna has been eyeing new uses for its mRNA technology since. A successful personalized cancer vaccine could help diversify its revenue sources and offset expected declines in sales of its only productsâ€”its original Covid-19 vaccine and the modified Covid-19 booster shot.</p><p>Researchers have long probed giving vaccines to patients with cancer, one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest markets.</p><p>Moderna makes its vaccine in a complex way because the shot is unique to each patient.</p><p>The Cambridge, Mass., company starts with a biopsy of the patient's tumor. Then it analyzes the tumor sample and identifies mutations in the cancer cells known as neoepitopes.</p><p>Moderna selects up to 34 neoepitopes that it believes would elicit the strongest immune response from a patient, and incorporates the genetic codes for these neoepitopes into a vaccine.</p><p>Once injected into a patient, the vaccine instructs the patient's cells to make the neoepitopes. This in turn is supposed to trigger an immune response that can better target and destroy cancer cells.</p><p>The companies have said they believe the immune response would complement the effect of Keytruda, which works by releasing the brakes on the body's immune system to fight tumors.</p><p>It takes about four to eight weeks between biopsy and the first injection of the cancer vaccine.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How might Moderna's \"personalized cancer vaccine\" affect you or people you know? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Small, early stage studies of the personalized cancer vaccine in people with various tumor types showed promise.</p><p>In 2019, Moderna and Merck, of Rahway, N.J., started a Phase 2 trial of the personalized cancer vaccine with Keytruda in people whose melanoma had been removed by surgery but were deemed to be at high risk of cancer recurrence.</p><p>After their surgeries, some patients received up to nine doses of the personalized cancer vaccine, given every three weeks, while also receiving Keytruda every three weeks for up to 18 cycles. Others received Keytruda alone.</p><p>Keytruda alone is approved for postsurgical treatment of melanoma patients, among its many uses, and has been shown to reduce recurrence.</p><p>\"This is the first time we see a really strong signal with a cancer vaccine,\" Eliav Barr, Merck's head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, said in an interview. \"This is the first time we can actually show that with the removal of the brakes on immune responsiveness that Keytruda provides, plus an extraordinarily good vaccine, we engender a really great immune response.\"</p><p>Study volunteers receiving the combination experienced adverse events that were consistent with Keytruda, such as fatigue and gastrointestinal effects, and those associated with mRNA vaccines, such as arm pain and aches.</p><p>The combination could help melanoma patients who are at high risk of recurrence after surgery based on certain features of their tumors, said Dr. Jason Luke, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who enrolled patients in the study.</p><p>\"This is a big deal because this is a major improvement,\" Dr. Luke said.</p><p>Moderna's development of the personalized cancer vaccine was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic because patient enrollment was paused temporarily, and Moderna repurposed some of the cancer vaccine manufacturing equipment to make early batches of its Covid-19 shots, Mr. Bancel said.</p><p>The companies released top-line data from the study in a press release, and it hasn't been vetted by peer review. They plan to publish full details in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p>Moderna expects its full-year 2022 sales to be $18 billion to $19 billion, roughly the same level as in 2021. Analysts project Moderna's sales will drop by more than half next year, however, because Covid-19 vaccinations are waning and Moderna has no other approved products to generate revenue.</p><p>Jefferies analysts estimated use of Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine by postsurgical melanoma patients could generate about $1 billion in annual sales. If it proves to work for additional types of tumors such as lung cancer, the vaccine's annual sales could reach $5 billion, the analysts said.</p><p>Moderna will split costs and any profits from the vaccine 50-50 with Merck under the terms of their collaboration. In September, Merck paid $250 million to Moderna to exercise Merck's option to jointly develop and commercialize the cancer vaccine.</p><p>Moderna also is pursuing other mRNA-based products. It is testing vaccines against seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and expects to report study results for those vaccines next year.</p><p>BioNTech SE, the mRNA-focused company that collaborated with Pfizer Inc. to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, also is developing a personalized cancer vaccine with Roche Holding AG's Genentech unit. Other companies developing vaccines designed to treat cancer include Gritstone bio Inc. and Nykode Therapeutics ASA.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at Peter.Loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna's mRNA Cancer Vaccine Shows Promise in Preliminary Study</p>",
