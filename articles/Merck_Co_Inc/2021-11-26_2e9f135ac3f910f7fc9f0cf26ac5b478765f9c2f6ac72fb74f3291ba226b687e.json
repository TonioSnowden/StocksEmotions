  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>The focus over a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic swung firmly from Europe to southern Africa today as a new variant provoked a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ca4536-07b2-463f-bb44-8159aaec89ab\">stream of emergency travel bans</a> to control its advance.</p> <p>The World Health Organization convened an emergency meeting in Geneva to discuss the new strain, B.1.1.529, which first emerged in Botswana but is now spreading rapidly in South Africa and surrounding countries.</p> <p>Although the WHO's Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution had yet to designate the strain a variant of “interest” or “concern”, anxiety over the potential danger of the mutation prompted a wave of travel bans this morning.</p> <p>Belgium has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8245c992-4a4d-4110-b10c-b294c41d501c#post-5c38b316-8125-49d0-8e13-00b77a5b81f2\">confirmed the first European case</a> of the new variant. The country had been among a number of European countries that further tightened rules aimed at controlling the existing spikes in Covid-19 cases this week.</p> <p>Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, tweeted earlier today that she would “activate the emergency brake to stop air travel from the southern African region due to the variant”.</p> <p>Sajid Javid, UK health secretary, described the variant as a “huge international concern”, telling MPs: “Early&#xa0;indications show this variant may be more transmissible than the Delta variant and current vaccines may be less effective against it.”</p> <p>Soumya Swaminathan, WHO chief scientist, said the new variant had “a number of worrying mutations in the spike protein”. But she also tweeted this morning: “Let's be cautious, listen to scientists and not panic.”</p> <p>Just a few dozen cases of the new variant have been formally verified through genomic sequencing. But early PCR results indicated that 90 per cent of the 1,100 new cases on Wednesday in the Gauteng region that includes Johannesburg appeared to be caused by the new variant, local health officials told the Financial Times.</p> <p>The strain has been described as the most concerning coronavirus variant that researchers have encountered. </p> <p>Despite the rollout of travel bans to and from the region, Israel, Hong Kong and Belgium have already confirmed cases of the new strain following genome sequencing analysis.</p> <p>South Africa's foreign ministry criticised the imposition of travel restrictions by the UK — imposed ahead of other countries — noting that it came ahead of WHO guidance on the issue. “Our immediate concern is the damage that this decision will cause to both the tourism industries and businesses of both countries,” it said.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Brexit and Covid-19 cause <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3feef87e-62b5-4fe5-bda4-92178095f092\">spike in Europeans leaving UK</a>, says ONS</p></li>  <li><p>How trade is helping companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a30165d-e3e3-4899-b8de-c9d3519f4ec2\">ride out the Covid wave</a></p></li>  <li><p>Talks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9a66140-f031-4ed6-9048-f6029832c511\">waive patents</a> on Covid vaccines are ‘stuck', WTO head warns</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8245c992-4a4d-4110-b10c-b294c41d501c\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Worries about the potential economic damage of the new coronavirus strain had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8df04124-c8e7-4c30-b4da-082ea635f308\">an immediate negative effect</a> on markets today, as investors and policymakers struggled to quantify the risks posed to the recovery. A broad sell-off in European shares followed similar moves in Asian markets, write the FT's markets team, compounding recent falls.</p> <p>Shares in European airlines, including International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, easyJet and Lufthansa, were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25171824-8b4f-4358-a91b-876745e9a6c7\">particularly badly hit</a>.</p> <p>Oil prices also fell sharply in early trading.</p> <p>And despite much of the US being distracted by Thanksgiving weekend, the Vix index — a measure of expected volatility in Wall Street stocks over the next month — rose 7.6 points on Friday to 26, the biggest increase since early 2021.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>European Central Bank policymakers expect the central bank to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d789f624-5097-4809-a0e0-2541056b7e63\">raise its short-term inflation forecasts</a> next month as uncertainty persists about how quickly it will need to respond to surging prices. </p> <p>Debate on how best to curb inflation while encouraging recovery comes amid another wave of lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which are aimed at tackling a European winter surge in Covid-19 cases that threatens to disrupt economic activity in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>Members of the central bank's governing council said they expected it to raise its 2022 forecast again in December, according to the minutes of its October meeting, which were published yesterday.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>Large numbers of Americans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f640868b-b007-448d-9186-57290f4b15ee\">return to stores and malls over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend</a>, despite higher prices, product shortages and an early surge in online spending before the formal start of the holiday season. <br><br>Sharply diverging earnings announcements from leading brands have set up the period between Thanksgiving on Thursday and Cyber Monday, the traditional five-day peak of the US retail calendar, as a decisive test of the industry's health.</p> <p>US consumers were expected to spend a record $5.1bn to&#xa0;$5.4bn&#xa0;online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe Analytics said yesterday.</p> <p>Amid debate on the impact Covid-19 has had on people's attitude to work, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/workersaftercovid\">a series of articles</a> by FT writers this week suggests labour markets have been reshaped by the pandemic in different ways.</p> <p>As Chris Giles writes, there has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/179dde6f-d392-459a-aa26-24a344c853a7\">no singular experience of labour markets</a> after the pandemic. Despite the profound shock of Covid-19 to major economies with high levels of labour force participation, the changes during the period have been outweighed by longer-term trends specific to those countries.</p> <h1>Science round-up</h1> <p><strong>Pandemic control:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d42bcd3d-e70d-4e97-818b-40b92d89d7ff\">“The virus is always searching for its next move”</a>: science is alert to new variants, but the unequal distribution of sequencing technology has created “gaping holes” in genomic surveillance.</p> <p>The World Trade Organization has warned that highly-charged talks on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9a66140-f031-4ed6-9048-f6029832c511\">intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines</a> are “stuck” and need governments to compromise at the WTO's main ministerial meeting next week, writes Alan Beattie. WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters yesterday: “If we take an all-or-nothing attitude, then it means potentially we all walk away with nothing.”</p> <p><strong>Vaccines:</strong> BioNTech will know in two weeks whether the vaccine it developed with Pfizer will work against the new B.1.1.529 variant, writes Hannah Kuchler.</p> <p>The German company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8245c992-4a4d-4110-b10c-b294c41d501c#post-5f2d07cc-468c-4b04-a91a-ab9c6c9ef107\">said today</a> was testing its vaccine against the strain in the lab.
