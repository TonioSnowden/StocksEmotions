  "text": "<p>   An oral Covid-19 treatment developed by Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc. failed in a midstage trial, the company said Tuesday, sending its stock down. </p><p>   Atea, in collaboration with Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Holding AG, said its treatment didn't cut the viral load in nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Boston-based Atea's stock plunged 66% Tuesday. </p><p>   Despite the negative news, the company said its data suggested that its AT-527 treatment has antiviral activity in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions. </p><p>   The results come after Merck &amp; Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said earlier this month that their experimental Covid-19 pill cut the risk of hospitalization or death by about 50% in high-risk people with mild to moderate Covid-19.  They have since filed an application asking U.S. health regulators to authorize their antiviral drug, molnupiravir. </p><p>   Atea and Roche said they are considering modifying their Phase 3, or final-stage, study of the drug based on the results from the Phase 2 study. Modifications could include changes to which patients are enrolled and the study's primary goal. Results are now expected in the second half of 2022; analysts had previously been expecting data this year. </p><p>   Antiviral drugs often are most effective early in the course of disease and show the most benefit in patients whose own immune systems aren't adequately fighting the virus. </p><p></p>",
