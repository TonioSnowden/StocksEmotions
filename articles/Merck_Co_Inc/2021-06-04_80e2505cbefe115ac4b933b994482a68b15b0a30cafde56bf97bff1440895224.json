That could allow the aircraft to cut some flight times in half, making trips between San Francisco and Tokyo in six hours.</p> <h1>The days ahead</h1> <p><strong>US jobs data</strong> US job creation is expected to have accelerated sharply last month. The government releases May's non-farm payrolls data later and the unemployment rate. A median forecast of economists surveyed points to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f38da494-2d09-4d8e-b39f-c531ee48ef3a\">employment of 650,000</a>. </p> <p><strong>Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary </strong>Authorities have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91108538-f34a-4078-9c8e-0cd8e55a0485\">banned</a> the annual candlelight vigil in Hong Kong to remember those who died in Beijing on June 4 1989.

But part of that trend can be blamed on Covid-19 — with important consequences for <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/abad2b97-b40a-4e68-8834-6d7c17dcd404\">how we interpret official data</a>. Economics editor Chris Giles, who led this week's series on inflation, told today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b39d432-0507-46b4-881c-e6e3a0c20c6e\">FT News Briefing podcast</a> that “for the first time in about 30 years [inflation] is something we have to think about”.</p> <ul>  <li><p>Global food prices have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b5f4b4d-cbf8-4269-af2c-c94063197bbb\">surged by the largest margin in a decade</a>, heightening fears that the inflation initially stoked by pandemic disruption was accelerating.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Las Vegas betting on conferences to inspire revival</strong> Trade shows are back and potentially could be the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1aa7c4f-2c56-48f1-ac9e-f524de869349\">saviour of Las Vegas</a>. Last year, as coronavirus shut casinos and exhibition halls, the total number of visitors to the city plunged 55 per cent. The World of Concrete event will mark the return of conventions to a city whose economy depends on them.</p> <p><strong>Some gripes about groupthink </strong>Groupthink has a terrible reputation, not helped&#xa0;by its Orwellian ring; the&#xa0;term is used so often that Tim Harford begins to fear that <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/6d821e56-64f3-4c59-84de-723b15dfc743\">we have groupthink about groupthink</a>. There is no shortage of solutions to the problem: the first and simplest is to embrace decision-making processes that require disagreement.</p> <p><strong>Naomi Osaka's unexpected strength </strong>Osaka's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ef860e6-6905-4f4a-9254-d5d61e2fab53\">shun the press</a> at the French Open tennis — and the tournament itself — seems to be a sign of greater strength than weakness, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/988f9b2c-a7e3-4f3a-aaa9-80657015faed\">writes Jo Ellison</a>. As someone who has described herself as cripplingly shy in past interviews, she has realised that in stepping away she is taking back her power.</p> <p><strong>AI's debate over profits and ethics </strong>Public attention has rightly focused on the worrisome uses of artificial intelligence, such as killer robots or facial recognition technology. But what remains unknowable are the benefits that may be lost by not fully using AI in responsible ways, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1990d60-082e-422c-9753-23ed395a58e4\">writes John Thornhill. </a></p> <h1>Podcast of the day </h1> <p><strong>Belarus: More than a moral dilemma </strong>Belarus's decision to divert a plane to Minsk to arrest a dissident journalist has renewed international condemnation and calls for sanctions against President Alexander Lukashenko's regime. In this episode of Rachman Review, Gideon talks to Katia Glod, a Belarusian political consultant, about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d89d572-9bb7-4649-970f-8071322a8e2f\">what happens next</a>.</p><p>Source: Wai Kwen Chan, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Today's top stories' FT.com 4 June.
