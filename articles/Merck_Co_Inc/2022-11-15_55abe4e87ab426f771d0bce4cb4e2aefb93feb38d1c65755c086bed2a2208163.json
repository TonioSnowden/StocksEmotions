  "title": "Venture Capitalists Back CG Oncology's Search for New Bladder Cancer Treatment; CG Oncology's immunotherapy might help patients avoid bladder-removal surgery",
  "text": "<p>Irvine, Calif.-based CG Oncology has now raised more than $200 million. The company targets a disease in need of new treatments and its drug shows promise when used alone and with other drugs, said Simone Song, founder and senior partner of ORI Capital, which co-led this financing with Longitude Capital and Decheng Capital.</p><p>More than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed this year and more than 17,000 people will die from the disease, the American Cancer Society estimates. About half of bladder cancers are detected while the cancer is still only found in the inner layer of the bladder wall and is noninvasive, according to the society.</p><p>Current treatments include the immunotherapy BCG, a standard treatment used in patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</p><p>CG Oncology is testing its virus-based drug in late-stage trials in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that doesn't respond to BCG. It is also studying the treatment in combination with the Merck &amp; Co. drug Keytruda in midstage trials of the same type of patients.</p><p>When patients have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that resists BCG, the concern is that the disease will progress to become muscle-invasive and that the opportunity to cure it could be lost, said Roger Li, the lead study investigator for the midstage trial and a urologic oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center, who said he previously has consulted for CG Oncology but has no current financial relationship with the company.</p><p>Bladder removal is an option to prevent the spread, but significant complications can occur with the surgery, Dr. Li said.</p><p>CG Oncology's virus-based therapy, delivered into the bladder through a catheter, could help patients avoid this surgery, said Arthur Kuan, the company's chief executive.</p><p>\"The goal is to be a backbone therapy and become a bladder-sparing therapeutic,\" Mr. Kuan said.</p><p>The drug infects cancer cells, replicates inside them and kills the tumor cells, according to the company. As cancer cells rupture they release tumor markers, or antigens, and a protein called GM-CSF. This stimulates an immune-system attack on cancer, according to CG Oncology.</p><p>Side effects the company has seen include mild cases of blood in the urine and sensitivity or discomfort during urination, which usually resolve within 24 to 48 hours, Mr. Kuan said.</p><p>Early this month CG Oncology said early data from the study of its drug in combination with Keytruda were promising. At the initial three-month time point of the trial, 28 of 32 patients had no detectable cancer, according to the company, which said it expects data on all patients through a minimum of 12 months in 2023.</p><p>In addition to supporting its current trials, CG Oncology expects next year to launch clinical trials of its treatment in intermediate-risk bladder cancer patients who haven't been treated with BCG, Mr. Kuan said.</p><p>RA Capital Management, Acorn Bioventures, Malin Corp., Ally Bridge Group and Sirona Capital also participated in the new financing.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
