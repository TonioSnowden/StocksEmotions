  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>Groundhog Day is coming up. I know. Have we ever escaped it since the pandemic struck? The headline news this week certainly feels strangely familiar: UK prime minister Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9be3fae-429c-4864-958b-4fa3d1edf2af\">on the ropes</a>, Ukraine and Russia on the brink of conflict. Are we really about to witness a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cbbd590-8e48-4687-a302-e74b6f0c905d\">return of the Soviet empire</a>?</p> <p>Fortunately, there is cause for celebration this week with the lunar new year on Tuesday — get some tips about the wisdom of investing in China from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/4bcf73fe-0046-4e98-b8b6-c5f976d21820\">this FT video</a>. </p> <p>There is also change afoot with the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions in France, England and Scotland, enabling the Old Firm football match in Glasgow to be played in front of a decent-sized crowd at Celtic Park for the first time in what feels like an age on Wednesday. </p> <p>Are you thankful for the certainty or eager for some change? Email me at <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>It is a busy week for economic news with further indications on inflation and unemployment in developed countries with purchasing managers' index data out to provide some international comparisons.</p> <p>The UK interest-rate decision will come on Thursday and a rise is expected, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ece46a25-291d-4c73-a229-79435a217058\">despite last week's data</a> pointing to a slowdown in the economy. After the Bank of England's communications fiasco late last year, it has decided to respond by saying less rather than more. A rate rise will be the first back-to-back tightening of monetary policy since 2004, fuelling expectations that more will follow.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>We are midseason for quarterly earnings with more Big Tech and bank results. These sectors have been among the winners from the pandemic, but they now face challenges as developed economies emerge from the crisis.</p> <p><strong>Meta</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7e37c19e-8fa3-439f-a870-b33f0520bcc0\">parent of Facebook and Instagram</a>, which reports on Wednesday, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">seeking new revenue sources</a> to power its future growth. It has also been stung by recent scandals over content moderation and privacy, contributing to a drop in popularity for its main social networking products, which in turn threatens its $85bn-a-year advertising-based business model.</p> <p>A number of carmakers will be arriving on the Wall Street forecourt and analysts will be looking to see whether they are any closer to making technological breakthroughs, such as on the perhaps overhyped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/189f75e7-da81-4f96-bbfc-4b3f7f6b1f2a\">driverless car</a>. </p> <p><strong>General Motors</strong>, which reports on Tuesday, is funding the transition to electric vehicles even as analysts expect to see revenue and earnings decline in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>The company said last week that it would spend more than $4bn to convert a Michigan factory to build electric pick-up trucks and another $2.6bn with LG Chem to build a battery cell plant. </p> <p>Analysts polled by FactSet predicted the automaker would earn $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter, down from $1.93 a year earlier, on revenue that has fallen 5 per cent to $36bn over the same period.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, Italy, Mexico: flash Q4 GDP data</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Evraz</strong> Q4 trading update</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, preliminary consumer price index (CPI) data for January</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, Japan: monthly unemployment figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, quarterly estimates of government deficit and debt plus British Retail Consortium's monthly economic briefing</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>KPN</strong> Q4, <strong>Mitsubishi Motors</strong> Q3, <strong>Ryanair</strong> Q2, <strong>UBS</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Australia, Reserve Bank of Australia holds its monthly meeting</p></li>  <li><p>Brazil, Banco Central do Brasil's monetary policy committee meeting begins</p></li>  <li><p>Canada, monthly GDP data</p></li>  <li><p>France, provisional CPI figures for January</p></li>  <li><p>Eurozone, France, Germany, Italy, UK, US: IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index data</p></li>  <li><p>EU, European Central Bank Q4 euro area quarterly bank lending survey plus Eurostat unemployment figures</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, monthly labour market figures</p></li>  <li><p>India, Union Budget</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Bank of England's monthly money and credit figures</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Alphabet</strong> Q4, <strong>ExxonMobil</strong>&#xa0;Q4, <strong>General Motors</strong> Q4, <strong>Lundin Energy</strong> FY, <strong>Starbucks</strong> Q1, <strong>Tele2</strong> Q4, <strong>UPS</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, flash monthly eurozone inflation data</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, monthly CPI data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Nationwide house price index</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Vodafone</strong> Q3 trading update</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>AbbVie</strong> Q4, <strong>Banco Santander</strong> FY, <strong>Ferrari</strong> FY, <strong>Meta</strong> Q4, <strong>Novartis</strong> Q4, <strong>Panasonic</strong> Q3, <strong>Sony</strong> Q3, <strong>Spotify</strong> Q4, <strong>Telenor</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h2>Thursday</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Compass Group</strong> Q1 trading update</p></li>  <li><p>EU, European Central Bank monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, Eurozone main refinancing rate plus retail sales figures</p></li>  <li><p>Eurozone, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US: IHS Markit services PMI data</p></li>  <li><p>South Korea, Turkey: CPI data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Bank of England bank rate decision plus corporate bond and gilt purchase target</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>ABB</strong> Q4, <strong>Amazon</strong> Q4, <strong>Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria</strong> Q3, <strong>BT</strong> Q3, <strong>ConocoPhillips</strong> Q4, <strong>Dassault Systemes</strong> Q4, <strong>Eli Lilly and Co</strong> Q4, <strong>Enel</strong> FY, <strong>ICE</strong> Q4, <strong>Infineon Technologies</strong> Q3, <strong>ING</strong> Q4, <strong>Merck &amp;
