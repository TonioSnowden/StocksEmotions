St. Petersburg on Monday mandated vaccines for everyone above the age of 60 and for people with chronic illnesses.</p><p>“Vaccinations should be mandatory,” Alexander Gintsburg, the director of Gamaleya, the state-run research center that developed Sputnik V, said in an interview with the government paper Rossiyskaya gazeta. He said the country needs to get to a vaccination rate of 70% to 75% to control the spread. Right now, just 34.6% of Russians are fully inoculated, according to Johns Hopkins University data.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, Greek hospitals are filling rapidly as that country sees a fresh surge of cases, while France is pushing its booster program aggressively.</p><p>Greece counted 8,613 new case in the latest day, and cases have more than doubled in less than two weeks, according to the Guardian.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron has told people over 65 that they will need to get a booster shot by mid-December to keep their vaccine passes valid.

And while cases have come down, they are still averaging more than 70,000 a day, and almost 50,000 patients are being hospitalized every day on average.</p><p>Read now: Viewers of these news outlets are most likely to believe COVID-19 falsehoods</p><p>New Mexico has emerged as a hot spot, alongside Colorado and California, and hospitals there are becoming overwhelmed, the New York Times reported. New cases per person have climbed 48% in New Mexico in the past two weeks, outpacing the nationwide average of 6%.</p><p>Don't miss:White House says 900,000 5- to 11-year-olds were vaccinated during first week of eligibility for scaled-down dose</p><p>Also see: Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics say Japan to purchase 1.6 million courses of their COVID antiviral if it's authorized</p><p>The news is noteworthy in that New Mexico has a vaccination rate of 63%, above the national average of 58%, after it led the way early in the program. But more than 70% of the hospitalized patients are unvaccinated, underlining the importance of getting shots. And Dr. David R. Scrase, New Mexico's health and human services secretary, told the paper that as first to vaccinate, “we're going to be the first one to experience the waning immunity.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/NMDOH/status/1458146125777616900Elsewhere, Germany is recommending that people under 30 only receive the vaccine developed by Pfizer PFE and German partner BioNTech BNTX, as the Moderna MRNA shot appears to cause more cases of heart inflammation, though those cases are still rare, Reuters reported.</p><p>Germany is also seeing a big surge in new cases, setting a one-day record Wednesday of 39,676, its third straight record day.</p><p>Read: Pfizer and BioNTech seek backing of COVID-19 booster for those 18 and over, as U.S. deaths continue to average 1,200 a day</p><p>Back in the U.S., the NFL fined the Green Bay Packers $300,000 and issued $14,650 in fines to quarterback Aaron Rodgers and wide receiver Allen Lazard for violations of league and players union protocols by failing to get vaccinated, the Associated Press reported. ESPN first reported the fines.</p><p>U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy lamented a revelation by actor Matthew McConaughey that he has not vaccinated his youngest children and wants more information before doing so, the Washington Post reported. </p><p>“If you are a parent out there and you have got questions, that's OK,”&#xa0;Murthy told CNN's Erin Burnett. “But talk to your doctor, consult credible health sources and recognize this is our opportunity to protect our kids and to get them back to so many things they [have] missed out on [during the pandemic].”</p><p>COVID-19 “is not harmless in our children,” he added. “Many kids have died. Sadly, hundreds of children, thousands have been hospitalized.”</p><p>Latest tallies</p><p>The global tally for the coronavirus-borne illness climbed above 251 million on Wednesday, while the death toll edged above 5.06 million, according to&#xa0;data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>The U.S. continues to lead the world with a total of 46.7 million cases and 757,419 deaths.</p><p>India is second by cases after the U.S. at 34.4 million and has suffered 461,849 deaths.
