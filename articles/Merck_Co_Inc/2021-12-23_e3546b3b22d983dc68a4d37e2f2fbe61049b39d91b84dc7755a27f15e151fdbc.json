  "text": "<p>Encouraging data regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine boosters against the omicron variant of the coronavirus were helping to underpin oil, analysts said, as well as studies indicating the strain was relatively less severe than the delta variant, though more infectious.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude CL00CLG22 for February delivery rose 92 cents, or 1.3%, to $73.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after posting the highest close Wednesday since Nov. 24. February Brent crude BRNG22, the global benchmark, was up $1.11, or 1.5%, at $76.40 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.</p><p>Crude found support the previous session after a larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.</p><p>“Crude prices stabilized after a wrath of mostly positive COVID vaccine/treatment headlines in the fight against omicron,” said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda, in a note.</p><p>“It seems all the major catalysts that await oil in the New Year lean towards higher prices,” he said. “This week, supply disruptions from Libya and Nigeria and a bullish EIA report have WTI crude trading comfortably above the $70 level. The U.S. is a net exporter again, diesel demand roared back, and stockpiles are dropping.”</p><p>Gasoline futures remained higher, but off session highs, after a fire at ExxonMobil Corp.'s XOM Baytown, Texas, refinery — the nation's fourth largest. The company said the blaze was extinguished. The fire left four individuals injured, the company said.</p><p>January gasoline futures RBF22 remained up 1.8% at $2.2066 a gallon, after trading as high as $2.21, its highest intraday level since Nov. 26. February heating oil HOG22 was up 0.9% at $2.3206 a gallon.</p><p>In news that suggested the impact of the omicron variant may not affect energy demand as much as feared, a University of Oxford study found a third dose of AstraZeneca's AZN vaccine was effective against omicron.. Also, Novavax NVAX said early data showed its COVID-19 vaccine produces an immune response. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer Inc.'s PFECOVID-19 antiviral pill, adding to the arsenal that can be used to fight the disease, and on Thursday the agency authorized Merck &amp; Co. Inc.'s MRK antiviral pill for adults who have tested positive for the virus and are at high risk of disease progression.</p><p>Natural-gas futures NGF22 fell 4.1% to $3.813 per million British thermal units on Nymex, leaving the U.S. contract on track for a 3.3% weekly gain. European natural-gas futures tumbled, with the price on the TTF platform in the Netherlands down 24% after surging earlier this week as gas flows from Russia to Europe reversed back to the east.</p><p>Tight supplies and a sharp drop in Russian flows amid rising tensions between Moscow and Ukraine have sent European natural-gas prices soaring, with Dutch futures still up more than 56% in December.</p><p>Read:Russia-Ukraine tensions mean Europe's natural-gas volatility unlikely to fade</p><p>Thursday's retreat came as the weather forecast for Europe was adjusted, showing no cold spell in the near term, said Aidana Childebayeva, a Budapest-based commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a note.</p><p>Additional weakness was attributed to a healthy schedule of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, imports, the analysts said, with multiple cargoes redirected from Asia to Europe due to favorable prices, the analyst said.</p><p>The Energy Information Administration on Thursday reported a withdrawal of 55 billion cubic feet of natural gas from storage in the week ended Dec. 17. Analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Platts, on average, had looked for a withdrawal of 57 billion cubic feet.</p>",
