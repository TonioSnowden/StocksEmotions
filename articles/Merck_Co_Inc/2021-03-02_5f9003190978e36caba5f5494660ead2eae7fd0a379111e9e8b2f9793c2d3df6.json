  "text": "<p>The US will have enough coronavirus vaccine doses for every adult by the end of May, Joe Biden said on Tuesday, thanks in&#xa0;part to an unusual production deal between two of the country's largest drugmakers. </p> <p>Merck will manufacture doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine after receiving $269m from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to adapt its manufacturing facilities to produce Covid-19 medicines and shots. </p> <p>The US president said on Tuesday the deal would accelerate the production of Covid-19 vaccines so that enough doses would be available to inoculate every adult within 90 days — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31c6186d-6b76-408b-83f0-a049130fdd7f\">two months earlier</a> than previously announced.</p> <p>Biden said: “I want to thank Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis. Here's what all this means: we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.”</p> <p>The Biden administration helped engineer the deal between the rival companies after J&amp;J, which was granted an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24719728-92bd-4c87-b4e2-a1a496b8229c\">emergency use authorisation</a> for its vaccine at the weekend, was beset by production delays.</p> <p>“These obviously, are two companies that [have] historically been competitors. The fact that they are coming together speaks to the ability of this administration . . . to bring them to the table and work together to address the pandemic,” Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, told reporters.</p> <p>Biden also announced that teachers in every state would be eligible to sign up for a vaccine through their local pharmacy as the administration aimed to reopen schools by the end of the president's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5213397b-cc0f-477c-80b5-8193bf718491\">first 100 days in office</a>.</p> <p>US officials had hoped that the authorisation of J&amp;J's vaccine would bolster the country's inoculation drive even before the deal with Merck. </p> <p>But they subsequently warned that after an initial 4m doses were delivered this week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5ba2702-3bad-4f10-9d80-00eb3d48d802\">supplies would be “uneven”</a> for the rest of March.&#xa0;J&amp;J had previously pledged to deliver 10m doses by the end of February.</p> <p>Merck will produce the vaccine and fill vials for J&amp;J, according to a company statement. </p> <p>Mike Nally, executive vice-president at Merck, said the funding from Barda would allow the company to “accelerate our efforts to scale up our manufacturing capacity to enable timely delivery of much needed medicines and vaccines for the pandemic”.</p> <p>While J&amp;J is the world's largest healthcare company, it is not nearly as experienced in vaccines as Merck and does not have the same kind of capabilities to produce inoculations at scale. </p> <p>J&amp;J said Merck was the ninth manufacturer to join its global network of producers. </p> <p>“Merck has a long history of vaccine expertise, and we expect this manufacturing arrangement will enhance our production capacity so that we can supply beyond our current commitments,” J&amp;J said in a statement. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/7ba6423a-9952-480a-8dc9-a70c537bff34.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Merck is one of the world's largest vaccine makers, with many shots already approved including for Ebola and HPV. </p> <p>However, the company has largely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/657b123a-78ba-4fba-b18e-23c07e313331\">stayed on the sidelines</a> of the Covid-19 inoculation drive. It was slow to enter the race to develop a vaccine and abandoned its efforts in January after disappointing results. </p> <p>Sanofi, another large vaccine maker that has fallen behind in Covid-19 vaccine development, has agreed to help boost supplies of the J&amp;J vaccine in Europe, announcing last month that it would use its capacity to fill vials. </p> <p>Biden said he would use the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d54bde97-076f-485e-9989-9d5a594f026e\">Defense Production Act</a> to speed up manufacturing by providing&#xa0;equipment and supplies, such as single-use plastic bags. The Financial Times reported that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/657b123a-78ba-4fba-b18e-23c07e313331\">shortage</a> of the large sterile liners threatened&#xa0;to&#xa0;create a bottleneck&#xa0;in the vaccine rollout.&#xa0;</p> <p>J&amp;J received the third emergency authorisation for a Covid-19 vaccine in the US. The vaccine should be easier to roll out than those from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, because it is only one shot — meaning people do not have to return for a second appointment — and can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by James Politi in Washington</em></p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in New York and Kiran Stacey in Washington  2021 'Biden says US will have enough jabs to vaccinate all adults by end of May' FT.com 2 March.
