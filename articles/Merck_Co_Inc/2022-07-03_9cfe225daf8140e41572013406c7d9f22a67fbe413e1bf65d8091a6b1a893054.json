  "title": "Merck Covid-19 Pill Prescribed Frequently in Some Countries Despite Low Efficacy; Doctors in Japan, Australia cite use of less-effective drug compared with Pfizer's Paxlovid because of risk of drug interactions",
  "text": "<p>The high demand for Lagevrio, also known as molnupiravir, in certain places reflects a preference for a low risk of potential drug interactions over keeping more people out of the hospital, despite criticism of the drug from doctors and authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>\"Molnupiravir is a lot easier because it's got a couple of minor restrictions, but it's actually much, much, much less risk for contraindications,\" said Australian Medical Association Vice President Dr. Chris Moy.</p><p>Should Lagevrio's use be sustained in these handful of countries, it could potentially spur supply agreements and boost sales for the drug.</p><p>Analysts' forecasts have been scaled back as Paxlovid's preference has grown. Lagevrio sales are forecast this year to reach $5.4 billion, compared with $24.8 billion of Paxlovid, according to analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Separate studies of unvaccinated, high-risk adults found Pfizer's drug to be 88% effective at preventing hospitalization, compared with 30% by the Merck-Ridgeback drug.</p><p>In large part due to the higher efficacy, Pfizer's Paxlovid remains the world's Covid-19 pill of choice. Countries—mostly rich ones—have secured more than 29 million courses of Paxlovid, compared with at least 12 million courses of Lagevrio, according to Duke University's Global Health Innovation Center.</p><p>Prescribing behavior could change given the limited time doctors have had with the pills, and the virus is forecast by experts to stick around for years.</p><p>Lagevrio became available for most people in Italy, Australia and Japan earlier than Paxlovid.</p><p>Unlike the U.S., these countries aren't recommending doctors reserve Lagevrio as a last-resort medicine or requiring certain patients to take contraception due to its reproductive risks, which likely played a role in prescribing, according to governments and health officials.</p><p>Lagevrio may be important in countries trying to quickly treat vulnerable populations taking multiple therapies like the elderly, because it can be prescribed without having to check a patient's liver or kidney functions, said Dean Li, who leads research and development for Merck.</p><p>\"I don't have to sit there and look at the list of seven medicines or four medicines and cross check. I can just give,\" said Dr. Li. \"When there's a surge, you have to move quickly.\"</p><p>Pfizer says physicians and pharmacists have experience navigating drug interactions and ones involving Paxlovid are generally manageable. It also says it is working with physicians to better understand the drug's use and manage potential drug interactions.</p><p>In Australia, about 48,600 Lagevrio prescriptions have been filled since it became available on the government's discounted program in March, compared with about 6,800 Paxlovid prescriptions, which became available two months later, according to data from the Australian government program that is one of the main ways of accessing the medications.</p><p>About 4,000 Lagevrio prescriptions are written weekly, compared with 1,000 for Paxlovid.</p><p>The two drugs are permitted there for people who are over 65 and indigenous Australians aged over 50, with certain health conditions that put them at risk for severe disease, and people over 18 who have weakened immune systems.</p><p>Many countries advise against Paxlovid treatment in patients taking certain other drugs, because it includes a component that can interact with other drugs in dangerous and life-threatening ways.</p><p>Recent Australian government guides to using the drugs in retirement homes told physicians that Lagevrio has no identified drug interactions, but that Paxlovid has had clinically important interactions with many drugs.</p><p>Paul Griffin, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Queensland who advises both Pfizer and Merck on Covid-19 antivirals, said people in Australia may be unaccepting of even a modest risk associated with Paxlovid because the country had done well on Covid-19 in general. He added that risks can be worked through \"if people understand what to look for and how to manage them.\"</p><p>Japan has approved both antiviral drugs for patients who are at high risk of developing severe disease. The Japanese government isn't giving priority to Paxlovid over Lagevrio.</p><p>Regulators in Japan also didn't require people to use contraception due to reproductive risks associated with Lagevrio.</p><p>In Japan, most high-risk people are the elderly and likely to be taking multiple medications, according to a Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare official. The potentially harmful drug interactions that doctors and pharmacists have to check before prescribing Paxlovid have made doctors cautious about giving the drug, according to Japanese health officials.</p><p>\"A lot of checks have to be made about drugs that patients are taking concurrently,\" said Fumie Okada, who heads the pharmaceutical division in the government of Hiroshima prefecture.</p><p>The scenario has led to 198,438 Lagevrio prescriptions as of June 15, compared with 9,662 Paxlovid prescriptions, according to the Ministry of Health.</p><p>In Italy, Lagevrio was approved in late November and has totaled about 31,000 prescriptions, compared with 21,000 prescriptions for Paxlovid, which was approved at the end of January and became available in mid-February, according to the Italian government.</p><p>Eric Sylvers contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
