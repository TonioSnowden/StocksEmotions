  "title": "Merck's Covid-19 Pill Was 30% Effective in Final Analysis, Company Says; The drug, which is up for authorization by the FDA, was less effective than the 50% rate reported earlier",
  "text": "<p>The FDA said it is still conducting its review of molnupiravir, after the companies told the agency earlier this week the pill was 30% effective in a final analysis of the late-stage study results. After taking an early look at results, the companies reported in October that molnupiravir was 50% effective.</p><p>Molnupiravir, and another experimental antiviral from Pfizer Inc. that is also under FDA review, promise to fill a big gap in Covid-19 treatment for a pill that people could easily take at home to keep them out of the hospital.</p><p>So far, people at high risk of severe disease seeking to avoid hospitalization have usually had to go to a hospital or clinic that can inject or infuse an antibody drug.</p><p>The U.K. cleared molnupiravir for use earlier this month.</p><p>FDA staff reviews are a routine part of the regulatory evaluation process before the agency decides whether to green light a product. Merck and Ridgeback requested emergency use authorization last month.</p><p>The drug's clinical-trial performance will be discussed Tuesday when an outside panel of advisers to the FDA meets and votes whether to recommend the agency clear the drug for use.</p><p>The FDA isn't required to follow the panel's advice but normally does. Should the panel give a thumbs-up, an FDA decision could come before the end of the year.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How would a Covid-19 pill help in the battle against the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The agency hasn't scheduled a meeting of the panel to review Pfizer's drug, called Paxlovid.</p><p>Researchers designed molnupiravir to work by mucking up the virus's ability to replicate, by introducing errors into its genetic code. A course of treatment is eight pills daily for five days, started within five days of showing symptoms.</p><p>In the documents it posted, the FDA said it became aware of the final analysis earlier this week and was still reviewing the data. The agency said its assessment, which was based on the interim analysis, might change, and that it would provide additional analysis when the panel meets Tuesday.</p><p>The FDA asked the panel to discuss the use of molnupiravir in pregnant women, who weren't included in the late-stage Merck-Ridgeback trial.</p><p>The agency said Merck agreed that molnupiravir should not be authorized for people under 18 years of age. It also said the drug shouldn't be cleared for use in hospitalized patients, after the drug failed to show benefit in a separate trial.</p><p>Some scientists have expressed concern about the safety of the drug and whether it might cause mutations in cells that are harmful to people.</p><p>Mutations were seen when researchers exposed Chinese hamster ovary cells in a lab to the drug compound for 32 days, but Merck says its testing has found the drug safe for people. Merck said diarrhea and nausea were the most common side effects in trial subjects who took molnupiravir.</p><p>The company plans to manufacture 10 million courses of treatment by the end of the year and at least double that amount next year.</p><p>Merck has agreed to provide the U.S. government 3.1 million courses of molnupiravir for about $2.2 billion, should regulators clear the pill for use.</p><p>The Biden administration is expected to allocate the supply to states, which in turn will direct them to pharmacies, hospitals and doctor's offices.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
