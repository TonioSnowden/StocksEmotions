  "text": "<p>BA.2 accounted for less than 10% of U.S. Covid cases at the end February. This week that number was almost 75%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Origins</p><p>Some virologists assumed that the next major variant would evolve from Delta, which was dominant in much of the world during the second half of 2021. But Omicron arose independently of Delta and was first detected in southern Africa late last year. The variant is more transmissible than Delta but may produce milder symptoms. Genetic analysis suggests that the BA.2 version of Omicron emerged slightly later than BA.1. It was at first slower to spread, but has since supplanted BA.1 in many parts of the world.</p><p>Mutations</p><p>Studies of Omicron provide clues as to why it is more transmissible than other variants. It has significantly more mutations than earlier versions of the virus, such as Alpha and Delta. These mutations may make it better at infecting cells, and at evading vaccines and treatments that were effective against earlier variants. Though BA.2 has similar mutations compared with BA.1, according to a recent study in Japan, BA.2 is different from BA.1 by more than 40 amino acids.</p><p>Some of the most significant mutations occur on the spike protein of the virus. These proteins ring the outer envelope of the pathogen, helping it latch onto respiratory cells.</p><p>Treatments</p><p>Some of these mutations may help BA.2 resist Covid-19 treatments such as monoclonal antibodies. The researchers in Japan performed an in-vitro experiment and discovered BA.2 was almost completely resistant to casirivimab and imdevimab and 35 times more resistant to sotrovimab. The Food and Drug Administration restricted the use of casirivimab and imdevimab from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in January. By late March, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Vir Biotechnology Inc.'s antibody treatment sotrovimab was restricted by the agency in several states where BA.2 was prevalent.</p><p>Research led by Nathaniel Landau, a virologist at New York University, showed similar results. The study compared how effective different variants were at evading neutralization by monoclonal-antibody drugs. An ancestral version of the coronavirus that was circulating early in the pandemic was most susceptible to the treatments. Delta proved more resistant, and BA.1 even more so. BA.2 was best at evading the neutralizing effects of the drugs.</p><p>Other therapeutics seem to hold up well against BA.2. Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir, molnupiravir from Merck &amp; Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, and the main component of Pfizer Inc.'s Paxlovid pill were all effective against the BA.2 variant, according to a study published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p><p>Vaccinations</p><p>Some research suggests that vaccines may provide less protection against infection from BA.2 than BA.1. A Danish study published earlier this year surveyed households with residents who tested positive for Covid and found that vaccinated people with the primary Covid vaccine series and an additional booster were more susceptible to infection from BA.2 than BA.1.</p><p>Another study suggested that boosters may provide similar protection against BA.2 compared with what they do against BA.1. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center collected antibodies generated by people who had received the Pfizer vaccine and mixed them with viral samples of BA.1 and BA.2 in the lab. Following the initial two doses, the amount of antibodies in the samples that could neutralize both BA.1 and BA.2 was relatively low. After the booster dose, though, the amount of antibodies against both subvariants jumped substantially.</p><p>The results show boosters produce a stronger immune response against both Omicron subvariants than the first two doses alone. Likewise, some scientists have expressed optimism that being fully vaccinated and boosted increases one's chances against severe disease brought on by BA.2.</p><p>Write to Josh Ulick at Josh.Ulick@wsj.com</p><p>Why the BA.2 Subvariant Could Cause Covid-19 Cases to Rise</p>",
