  "title": "Vaccines  Promised  For U.S.  Adults by  May 31  ---  Biden calls on states  to prioritize teachers;  Merck to help produce  J&J's approved shot  ----  By Tarini Parti and Sabrina Siddiqui",
  "text": "<p>   President Biden said the U.S. would have enough Covid-19 vaccines for all adults in the country by the end of May, two months earlier than he had previously said, after regulators authorized the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and Merck &amp; Co. agreed to help produce it. </p><p>   Mr. Biden also called on states to give priority to teachers, school staff and child-care workers for vaccinations, as virtual learning continues for many students across the country. Several teachers unions have made vaccinations part of their negotiations for returning to in-person teaching. Mr. Biden said 30 states are giving priority to such workers for the shot. </p><p>   Mr. Biden said the federal pharmacy program would give priority to teachers, and he set a goal for those workers to get at least one dose of the vaccine by the end of March. </p><p>   \"Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said Tuesday. </p><p>   The president said the partnership to make the new J&amp;J vaccine, which was cleared by regulators on Saturday, is \"the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II.\" He said the U.S. will have enough supply for all adults by the end of May, but it wasn't immediately clear when everyone would be able to get the shot. </p><p>   Prioritizing teachers isn't without controversy, as some say it takes vaccines away from higher-risk people and communities of color. </p><p>   J&amp;J said it expected the collaboration with Merck to \"enhance our production capacity so that we can supply beyond our current commitments.\" A Merck spokesman said Tuesday that the company \"remains steadfast in our commitment to contribute to the global response to the pandemic and to preparing to address future pandemics.\" </p><p>   White House press secretary Jen Psaki said one Merck facility will help \"fill-finish\" the vaccine -- a step in which vials are filled with vaccines, capped and readied for shipment -- and another will help produce the vaccine. </p><p>   She said conversations between J&amp;J and Merck were under way and the administration helped in completing the deal, in part by providing Merck with a commitment to help with upgrading its facilities for vaccine production. </p><p>   An administration official said Mr. Biden was invoking the Defense Production Act to give Merck priority access to supplies, including purchase of machinery, tubes and filtration systems. The Department of Health and Human Services said it would provide an initial investment of $105 million for Merck to convert, upgrade and equip its facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the vaccine. </p><p>   J&amp;J executives have said they ran into challenges in scaling manufacturing output but that they would deliver 100 million vaccines to the U.S. in the first half of 2021. </p><p>   White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients worked on the deal with the two companies' chief executives and officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, a person familiar with the situation said. </p><p>   Administration discussions about ramping up production of the J&amp;J vaccine began in late January, two people familiar with the situation said, and officials reached out to the companies in February. Mr. Zients kept Mr. Biden up to date on the discussions.  Merck indicated it would agree to the arrangement about two weeks ago, they said. </p><p>   J&amp;J, based in New Brunswick, N.J., had made nearly four million doses for shipments that began going out this week. The Biden administration said it expected about 20 million doses to be delivered by the end of March. </p><p>   The administration has emphasized the urgency of vaccinating the public against Covid-19 and warned of a new and more transmissible variant that is rapidly spreading. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said Tuesday that as of March 10 businesses in the state will be able to operate at full capacity and state residents will no longer be required to wear masks to visit them. </p><p>   Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and J&amp;J, without the supplement from Merck, are scheduled to supply enough doses in the U.S. in March to vaccinate about 80 million people, according to Evercore ISI analysts. </p><p>   In April, enough doses will be supplied for 125 million people, assuming shots from AstraZeneca PLC and Novavax Inc. are cleared for use, according to Evercore. By the end of May, the analysts projected the U.S. will have received enough Covid-19 vaccine doses since December to fully vaccinate 345 million people. </p><p>   As of Monday, more than 50.7 million Americans had received at least one dose of vaccine, representing about 15.3% of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>   Merck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., is a pioneer in vaccines, such as those to prevent mumps and shingles, but it scrapped two programs to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in January after disappointing clinical studies. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jared Hopkins and Stephanie Armour contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
