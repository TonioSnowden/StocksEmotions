  "text": "<p>Pfizer is seeking regulatory authorisation in the US for its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30efb138-0223-4b84-a30f-79f0e018a4b8\">Covid-19 antiviral pill</a>, which has been shown to cut the risk of hospitalisation and death for adults by almost 90 per cent in late-stage studies.</p> <p>The submission by Pfizer to the Food and Drug Administration is directed towards patients at high risk from Covid-19, who could be prescribed a course of pills to be taken at home. It follows reports that the Biden administration is poised to announce this week that it will buy 10m courses of the Pfizer drug, which is called Paxlovid. </p> <p>Public health officials believe easy-to-use antiviral pills can play a crucial role in tackling the pandemic by preventing people with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 symptoms from developing severe disease. </p> <p>Merck has already applied to the FDA for authorisation for an antiviral pill it developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. External advisers to the FDA will meet on November 30 to consider whether to recommend authorisation for the drug, which is called&#xa0;molnupiravir. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>It remains unclear when the FDA will set a date for experts to review Pfizer's antiviral pill.</p> <p>Experts say Merck and Pfizer's antiviral pills must be administered within a few days of contracting Covid-19 to be effective. A course of pills will typically be taken over a period of five days, according to both companies' clinical trials.</p> <p>Albert Bourla, Pfizer chief executive, said the company is moving as quickly as possible in its efforts to get the potential treatment into the hands of patients. Pfizer had begun similar applications in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, it said.</p> <p>On Tuesday The Washington Post reported the US government would announce a deal to buy 10m courses of Pfizer's antiviral pill this week. It comes as new Covid-19 cases have begun rising again in the US, after a lull over recent months. </p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday Pfizer announced that it had followed Merck and agreed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81b7762f-9bc9-4776-9fe8-c2da0df5517b\">licensing</a> deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool to expand low-cost access to its Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/848cce54-0d47-4488-b829-5539abddcf6e\">antiviral pill</a> throughout the developing world.</p> <p>It is the first time the US pharmaceutical company has agreed to share the technology behind a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/stream/fc708e00-51cc-48d4-9ce4-737761e18abe\">Covid-19 medical product</a>, in contrast to its refusal to license its vaccine to generic manufacturers. &#xa0;</p> <p>The royalty-free deal with the MPP should boost global supplies of Pfizer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30efb138-0223-4b84-a30f-79f0e018a4b8\">antiviral pill</a>. Generic manufacturers would now be able to make the drug in advance of its approval by regulators to speed up its supply to low and middle-income nations, experts said.</p> <p>Pfizer has come <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd133d09-3cec-414d-a4da-9631e5d234a4\">under pressure</a> over its refusal to share the technology behind the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with its German partner BioNTech. It has forecast sales of the jab will reach $36bn in 2021 and $29bn in 2022. </p> <p>Health officials claim the company's opposition to sharing intellectual property has contributed to a shortage of jabs in low and middle-income nations, with just 7 per cent of Africans fully vaccinated. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Pfizer and BioNTech oppose efforts supported by the Biden administration to waive IP rights on Covid-19 vaccines, warning that third-party manufacturers could make mistakes in production that undermine public confidence. Instead, they have focused on boosting their own production, selling the jab at lower prices in the developing world and in BioNTech's case announcing plans to build a plant in Africa.</p> <p>“Unlike our oral antiviral, which is a small chemical molecule, high-quality vaccines are large biological molecules that require consistent biological production,” a Pfizer spokeswoman said. “It is an extraordinarily complex process under any circumstances, and even more so during a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">pandemic</a>.”</p> <p>Nancy Jecker, professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, said Merck's example had raised the bar for Pfizer, making it harder for the company to do less with its own antiviral.</p> <p>“Smart companies will recognise that socially responsible behaviour helps their competitive edge and relationships with stakeholders over the long term,” she told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Last month Charles Gore, executive director of MPP, told the FT he was disappointed Covid-19 vaccine makers had not fully engaged with the organisation to see whether they could overcome the difficulties in sharing technology. </p> <p>He said the new licensing deal with Pfizer for antiviral drugs was important because these type of pills were particularly well-suited for use in low and middle-income nations. Doctors have until now had to rely on the expensive and hard-to-administer antiviral remdesivir and monoclonal antibody treatments, which typically require infusions. </p> <p>The MPP was founded to help provide treatments for HIV/Aids. Last year it expanded its mandate to include Covid-19 treatments and began liaising with companies to try to license medicines and pool intellectual property.</p><p>Source: Jamie Smyth in New York and Donato Paolo Mancini in London 2021 'Pfizer seeks FDA authorisation for Covid-19 pill' FT.com 16 November.
