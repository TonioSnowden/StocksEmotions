  "title": "Moderna's CEO on Its New Covid-19 Booster, Prospects for Cancer Vaccines; Stéphane Bancel discusses the company's latest Covid shot and research on using mRNA in seasonal flu vaccines and personalized treatments for cancer",
  "text": "<p>At a WSJ Future of Everything conference on health, Moderna's Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel discussed the new booster as well as the future of the company's mRNA vaccines.</p><p>Your new booster was authorized before the clinical trials finished. How confident are we that it will work and we won't get hurt?</p><p>Safety is always the priority No. 1 for any vaccine. As you know, mRNA is a platform. We use exactly, 100%, the same chemical matter to make the mRNA, 100% the same chemical matter for enveloping it, and the manufacturing process is exactly the same. So given the very large database that we have—literally hundreds of millions of people since the beginning of the pandemic—on the model of vaccine, the regulators around the world feel very confident, like we do, that there is no scientific reason we would see an unexpected safety signal.</p><p>Molecular biology is not black magic. You change your sequence for a few mutations, the body is going to make exactly the protein instructed in the mRNA, and your immune system is going to make an antibody to it. That's why I think the regulators are getting very comfortable. That's what happens every year for flu [vaccine]. We don't run through clinical testing every year.</p><p>Do we think that this new vaccine will work better against BA. 5, the dominant strain in the U.S. now?</p><p>What happened with Omicron was that the protection against transmission went down a lot—around two months of protection after a booster—because we had such a massive genetic drift. We think that as we're teaching your immune system all those new tricks that are part of the Omicron mutation, that we should regain the duration of protection for transmission. But we believe level of protection against hospitalization and death is going to remain extremely high.</p><p>Until now, it's been people getting boosters every few months. Do we think that this could actually confer protection that lasts for a year?</p><p>Yes, we think so. We think that if you can adapt the Covid booster every year to whatever is circulating right now, like with flu, you will be able to get long protection.</p><p>We are in Phase 3 [testing] for flu. We should get the data in the coming months allowing us to file for accelerated approval. We could potentially in the fall of 2023 have the Moderna flu vaccine. We'll be able to talk to the regulators and public-health experts in the spring to decide \"What do you want for flu for the fall?\" instead of doing what has been done for many years—which doesn't really work well—which is guessing the strain from what's happening in the southern hemisphere. So I think even in flu, there's a lot of change coming very soon.</p><p>So there's a chance that we could have by next fall a combination flu and Covid shot? Or two different shots?</p><p>For next fall it's going to be too tight timingwise to do combinations. There will be two shots—potentially with better efficacy on the flu side, because we'll be adapted to what's circulating in the U.S., which might be a different vaccine than in the U.K. or Japan. We're working in the clinic on a combination single dose for Covid and flu, but I think it's more for the fall of '24.</p><p>As you were saying, part of this is forward-looking because you have this platform technology that you feel is going to produce more vaccines. What's next?</p><p>Flu is the next one. It could be as early as 2023. And on RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], there's been some interesting news in the field because the world has needed an RSV vaccine for decades.</p><p>Why is RSV a pressing public-health issue?</p><p>RSV is a respiratory virus like flu and Covid. It's transmitted in the same way and gives you the same flulike symptoms. Pre-Covid, it was the No. 2 killer in the U.S. among respiratory diseases. A lot of times, we've had RSV infection without knowing it, because we had flulike symptoms.</p><p>Our strategy is to combine all those things. We want a vaccine that does Covid booster, adapted, flu booster, adapted, and RSV, all in a single dose that you can get at your local pharmacy or doctor or employer early in the fall.</p><p>Another one that you're working on is a personalized cancer vaccine. Can you tell us how this works and where it stands?</p><p>This is a very interesting approach that would use the same vaccine technology as a Covid product—100% the same chemistry, using it to teach your immune system the signature of a cancer cell that it has missed.</p><p>If you're healthy with a strong immune system, your immune system will see the cancer cell and will literally chew it up. That's why the progress in immuno-oncology has been really remarkable in the last years. If you have cancer disease—meaning growth of your tumor—it is because your immune system didn't see it.</p><p>We showed in Phase 1 [testing] that we can teach a T-cell the mutation that it didn't see in the same patient before the treatment. So what we're doing now is comparing [Merck's] Keytruda immunotherapy with Moderna plus Keytruda. We'll share that data in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Merck's Keytruda is an example of immunotherapies that help the body's own immune system recognize and attack cancer. You think that the combination of Keytruda with your personalized cancer vaccine would have a synergistic effect?</p><p>That's the scientific thesis that we and many doctors and scientists that we talked to as we were coming with a concept had. We'll have to look at the clinical data to make a conclusion.</p><p>Before the pandemic, Moderna didn't have an approved product. And now you're this huge company, big success. What have you learned?</p><p>For me, the most exciting thing we've learned is that mRNA can work safely in humans. We've shown that on a massive scale. And now we have a lot of capital — $18 billion is a lot of cash. And the good news for us is, unlike most companies trying to think \"What's my next drug?\" we have this amazing potential because of the [mRNA] platform. You have thousands of mRNA molecules in every one of your cells. And so, if we can get a safe and effective amount of mRNA into your cells, it is going to make the right protein. That's what you do all day long, trillions of times. Another piece that I think people sometimes miss is that the instruction we code in the information molecule exists in nature. Think about Covid. We did not invent spike [the protein the vaccine targets]. Spike existed in nature.</p><p>Do you have a sense of where mRNA doesn't work?</p><p>We don't know yet. You have mRNA in every one of your cells. So the key question for us is, can we get the mRNA safely into those cells, so they can do what they're supposed to do, which is make the protein we designed? We don't know how to get into the brain today. We're working on it. We don't know how to get into your kidney, or how to get into your immune cells. We're working on those.</p><p>How about the public-health goal of developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine, can we do that?</p><p>For 25 years people have been saying we're very close to a universal flu shot. Once the biology is understood, in terms of how do you have to code the protein, we can make a vaccine very quickly as with Covid. But until that biology is understood, I don't know what to put into the message on the protein that will be universal. It's a great goal to have. I have seen no recent data to make me believe it's coming anytime soon.</p><p>Interview has been condensed and edited.</p><p>Write to Jonathan D.
