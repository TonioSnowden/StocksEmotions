  "text": "<p>   The Holmans wanted a partner that not only would move quickly to test and manufacture molnupiravir, but would also invest in making doses before it was known whether the drug worked. In addition, the couple also wanted to work with a company that would license the drug to generic drugmakers to make the drug available and affordable in poor countries. </p><p>   In May 2020, Merck and Ridgeback announced their collaboration, triggering a race to further test the drug and make 10 million doses by the end of 2021. Merck gained world-wide rights to molnupiravir for payments to Ridgeback and an agreement to split profits. </p><p>   The development of molnupiravir would become one of the fastest for any drug in the 130-year history of Merck, a longtime developer of antivirals for HIV and other diseases. </p><p>   The Holmans, Dr. Perlmutter said, \"were eager to go like the wind. They wanted to push us to do that.\" He said Merck worked to move fast while maintaining scientific rigor. </p><p>   One concern Merck probed was molnupiravir's safety. </p><p>   Molnupiravir works by introducing mutations into the RNA of the virus as it tries to replicate, creating errors that weaken it and eventually stop the process. Years earlier, a standard lab screening assay, called an Ames test, had suggested that the compound might introduce mutations into human DNA as well as viral RNA. </p><p>   Merck spent at least six months doing its own deep dive to test the drug's safety, including conducting its own Ames test that also suggested the potential for mutations. Company researchers also performed two elaborate experiments giving high doses of the drugs to rats for about a month to see if there were genetic changes in the animals' DNA. They didn't find evidence of mutations due to the drug. </p><p></p>",
