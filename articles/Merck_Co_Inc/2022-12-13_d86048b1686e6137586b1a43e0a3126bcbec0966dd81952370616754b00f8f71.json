  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX added 20 points, or 0.5%, to 4,010</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 46 points, or 0.1%, to 34,048, after rising 707 points at its session high.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP climbed 78 points, or 0.7%, to 11,221</p><p>On Monday, the Dow rose 529 points, or 1.6%, the S&amp;P 500 SPX jumped 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is up 8% from its 2022 low hit in mid-October, but remains down more than 27% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks initially rallied on Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping over 600 points in the morning session, after the November inflation data from the consumer price index showed inflation cooled considerably to its lowest level in nearly a year. However, three major indexes came off their best levels in afternoon trade.</p><p>The year-over-year CPI for November was 7.1%. That's less than the forecast by economists expecting to see a decline to 7.3%. The 7.1% print is down from 7.7% last month. The closely watched \"core\" CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, came in at 6% year over year. That's lower than expectations and lower than October's 6.3% annualized increase.</p><p>The data comes a day before the Fed will deliver its latest interest rate increase. The central bank is widely expected to raise rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. That would follow four jumbo-sized 75 basis point hikes.</p><p>Economists at Citi think the report casts a dovish shadow on tomorrow's FOMC meeting and will help narrate the slowdown to a 50bp hike. However, they warned the risk remains that Chair Powell doesn't endorse the market's dovish view of likely Fed policy.</p><p>\"Chair Powell has a somewhat binary choice to make – any comments that can be construed as dovish will stoke the rally in equity markets and lead to a further easing of financial conditions,\" wrote Andrew Hollenhorst, chief US economist at Citi.</p><p>\"To avoid this, Powell would have to both downplay the importance of this morning's inflation report (e.g. emphasize that there is not yet \"compelling evidence\" of a slowdown) and probably explicitly push against the market pricing of a sub-5% terminal policy rates followed by imminent cuts,\" he added.</p><p>As of Tuesday afternoon, there was more than a 50-50 chance of a 25 basis point increase to the fed-funds rate in February, in the eyes offed funds futures traders.</p><p>But a rate increase in February of only a quarter basis point is \"wishful thinking,\" according to Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. He's expecting 50 basis-point increases on Wednesday, followed by another in February, and then a chance of a smaller 25 basis points hike at the Fed's March meeting.</p><p>\"The data was good, but not good enough to inspire the Fed to back off.…I think anybody banking on 25 [basis points] in February is seeing something that is not there.\"</p><p>Pavlik said Tuesday's intraday retreat in stocks reflected \"a little bit of rationality returning to the market\" after stocks soared at the opening bell.</p><p>See: Why November U.S. CPI data is seen as a 'game-changer' for financial markets</p><p>Intraday market moves are common on CPI days. Throughout the year, trading on days of consumer price index data has been volatile.</p><p>\"We don't get many days as important as the next two, and the U.S. CPI today and the FOMC [Fed] tomorrow are likely to be the difference between a big Santa Claus rally and a visit from Scrooge ahead of Christmas,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a note ahead of the November CPI release.</p><p>\"Bear in mind the S&amp;P 500's best and worst day of the year so far have both come on a CPI day, and it was only last month that the downside surprise triggered a seismic market reaction, leading to the biggest one-day gain for the S&amp;P 500 (+5.54%) since April 2020, and the largest daily decline in the 2-year Treasury yield (-24.7bps) since 2008,\" Reid added.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK and Moderna Inc. MRNA said Tuesday that their experimental mRNA-based cancer vaccine reduced the risk of recurrence or death when used with Merck's Keytruda in patients with late-stage melanoma. Moderna shares surged 24%, while Merck shares rose 1.4%.</p><p>* Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY released its 2023 guidance on Tuesday, highlighting potential launches on treatments including one for obesity. The pharmaceutical company is forecasting earnings per share (EPS) to range next year from $7.65 to $7.85, with a revenue ranged from $30.3 billion to $30.8 billion, the company said. FactSet consensus called for an EPS of $9.16 and revenue of $30.2 billion. Shares are down over 1% in trading Tuesday.</p><p>* Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA extended declines, down 4.3% on Tuesday. The electric vehicle maker was reported last week to suspend Model Y assembly at its Shanghai plant between in late December. The company is on pace to close with a market cap less than $500 billion for the first time in over two years, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow clings to gain in choppy trade as Wall Street gauges cooler inflation report, next Fed rate decision</p>",
