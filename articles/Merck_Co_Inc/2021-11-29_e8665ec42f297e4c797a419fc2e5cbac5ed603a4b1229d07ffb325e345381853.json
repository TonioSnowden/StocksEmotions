  "title": "Omicron vaccines: booster shots will boost the mRNA pioneers",
  "text": "<p>So much for the turkey. Staff at US vaccine maker Moderna spent Thanksgiving studying the Omicron coronavirus variant. Moderna's shares have since risen by as much as a third, with those of German peer BioNTech not far behind. That is a measure of the hopes pinned on mRNA pioneers in the face of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7aa4bd3-4405-41f9-bacc-51fb40181156\">latest threat</a>. </p> <p>A big advantage of this technology is its adaptability. Unlike traditional vaccines, which involve growing cells in a vat, mRNA jabs are genetic code, wrapped in tiny bubbles of fat. If Omicron evades existing vaccines, new versions could be ready in as little as 100 days. </p> <p>It is possible that the new variant will diminish, not demolish, the effectiveness of vaccines. If so, tweaks to their design may be superfluous. A third dose of the existing vaccines might be enough just to top up immunity. Omicron is no reason to panic but a great reason to get boosted, the boss of the National Institutes of Health said on Sunday. </p> <p>The expansion of booster programmes will consolidate the position of the two top vaccine makers. Pfizer, with its German partner BioNTech, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5054863d-2c1e-4e2b-89ab-5d1a4a2ff0f8\">dominates</a>. Moderna, which has suffered manufacturing glitches,&#xa0;is the runner-up. Pfizer has repeatedly increased this year's forecast vaccine sales, most recently to $36bn. It&#xa0;expects to rake in four-fifths of that next year. </p> <p>It could bring in nearly as much from its antiviral pill Paxlovid. This slashes hospitalisation risk to a greater degree than a similar drug from Merck. Analysts expect both companies to price their drugs at about $700 for a course of treatment. A phenomenal response to Covid-19 will almost double Pfizer's revenue this year. It could even top $100bn in 2022, a record for the pharma industry, some analysts suggest. </p> <p>This is more than a flash in the pan. The antiviral pills, which are unlikely to be affected by mutations, will be an invaluable second line of defence to vaccines. Governments will want a stockpile. Given capacity constraints, it would take several years for Pfizer to satisfy that demand. </p> <p>The long-term need for Covid-19 vaccines is uncertain. For many diseases, several doses confer life-long immunity. But fast-changing viruses require regular updates. Combating coronavirus could end up resembling a game of whack-a-mole. That would support a multibillion-dollar a year market, just as flu jabs do.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
