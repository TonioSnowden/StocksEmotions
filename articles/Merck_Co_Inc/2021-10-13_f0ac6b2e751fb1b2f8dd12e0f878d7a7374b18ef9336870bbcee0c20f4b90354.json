  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> a KKR-led investor group is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c46aed3-bf84-42e9-b9d1-28d580a0161f\">closing in on a deal</a> to buy a song catalogue spanning hits from Lorde and The Weeknd for $1.1bn, in the latest sign that a private equity-fuelled land rush for music hits is gaining pace. </p> <h2>THG: the SoftBank-backed beauty group in need of a facelift</h2> <p><strong>Akshay Naheta</strong> is no stranger to controversial trades. </p> <p>Back in 2019, the former <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>trader <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b29f452a-40c4-4f62-b193-d0c90af84bfe\">engineered</a> <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s $1bn bet on the German payments group <strong>Wirecard</strong>. At the time, the company said short sellers were orchestrating the accusations of fraud levelled against it.</p> <p>When Wirecard unravelled the following year, vindicating years of Financial Times reporting on its accounting irregularities, some clever structuring on Naheta's part meant that the SoftBank executives who invested in the deal lost nothing. </p> <p>Far from denting his reputation, the then 39-year-old ex-trader was shortly thereafter made manager of a new internal hedge fund unit — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\"><strong>SB Northstar</strong></a> — that soon generated notoriety for carrying out the so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2\">Nasdaq whale trades</a> in US stocks later in 2020. &#xa0;</p> <p>Flash forward to 2021, however, and the value of another highly touted technology company backed by Naheta <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b88d9d9-1ee4-496c-ba8b-342659401401\">has plummeted</a>, after the group's chief executive declared his company was under a “short attack” from hedge funds betting against its shares.</p> <p>Formerly known as <strong>The Hut Group</strong>, the Manchester-based seller of make-up and protein shakes last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daf0192f-fd42-4fda-9e86-ce26d10e53b8\">raised £1.9bn</a> in one of the London market's largest IPOs in years. </p> <p>The listing cemented its founder<strong> Matthew Moulding</strong>'s status as a billionaire — quite the journey for an entrepreneur who established the company as an online CD seller <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ba4968f-5dd1-45e6-88b4-02cd4570b7b9\">back in 2004</a>.</p> <p>THG says it does far more than just flog protein powder and lipstick, however. The group has also touted how its ecommerce platform can be used by other companies to gain a toehold in the fiercely competitive arena of online retail.</p> <p>Its technological knowhow was seemingly vindicated when SoftBank invested more than $700m in the group back in May via SB Northstar.</p> <p>But true to form, there was a complex twist: Naheta's unit also gained the option to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in a subsidiary called <strong>THG Ingenuity </strong>— which offers brands access to THG's online retailing platform and logistic capabilities through white-labelled websites — for $1.6bn within 15 months.</p> <p>Shareholders initially cheered the SoftBank deal, which implied THG was sitting on a previously little-known subsidiary with a potential enterprise value of £4.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet the group's share price soon drifted lower as more sceptical analysts and investors began to peer under the hood of the nascent business to get a handle on what it was really worth.</p> <p>That was all supposed to change on Tuesday when THG held a capital markets day to explain to investors the “genius of THG Ingenuity”.</p> <p>Instead, Moulding opened with his broadside against short sellers and investors were left dissatisfied with management's attempts to explain the business. </p> <p>Cue a 35 per cent drop in its share price.</p> <p>This isn't great news for SoftBank: THG's stock has more than halved from the price it invested at, raising questions over what its option on Ingenuity is really worth now, given that THG has a market capitalisation of £3.5bn — £1bn less than the enterprise value SoftBank's deal ascribes to its subsidiary.</p> <p>As the FT's Helen Thomas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc8095b7-5b9f-4b01-a3a9-a1a5e3d6e29f\">notes</a>, Moulding once took to Instagram to celebrate his gym-going for 500 consecutive days in locations across the globe. DD wonders if his globetrotting schedule will now include a trip to Naheta's base in Abu Dhabi to explain what went wrong.</p> <h2>A music mogul and a private equity titan walk into a bar . . . </h2> <p><strong>Merck Mercuriadis</strong> has been at the centre of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71c2be62-b823-47d9-9f43-ab322883aa8c\">feeding frenzy</a> for music rights over the past two years, spending more than $2bn on catalogues since he floated <strong>Hipgnosis</strong>, which has a <a href=\"https://www.hipgnosissongs.com/\">stoned elephant</a> as its logo, in 2018.</p> <p>His capital market days have featured his high-profile friends and partners such as <strong>Nile Rodgers</strong> of <strong>Chic</strong> and<strong> Richie Sambora</strong> of <strong>Bon Jovi</strong>. </p> <p>Yet on a call with the FT, the usually irrepressible music mogul took a back seat as <strong>Qasim Abbas </strong>from private equity titan <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s tactical opportunities group discussed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f9ce243-d77a-44f6-a615-384eda335b42\">new $1bn music rights fund</a> that will bear the Hipgnosis name. </p> <p>The private fund <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Capital</strong> will provide Blackstone with more financial muscle in the battle for the best music rights as the firm, which spent five intense months talking to Mercuriadis, follows <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cf2d759-5f44-486b-a6d4-b0892d51a63a\"><strong>KKR</strong> </a>and <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> into the musical fray.</p> <p>Blackstone <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9563360/blackstone-buying-eone-music-hasbro-death-row-records/\">already owns</a> <strong>Death Row Records</strong>, the label co-founded by<strong> Dr Dre</strong> that catapulted West Coast hip-hop legends including <strong>Tupac Shakur</strong> into the spotlight during the late 90s, but the Hipgnosis tie-up is a more concerted effort to write a financial hit.</p> <p>The Blackstone/Hipgnosis collaboration isn't to be confused with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e24ffd6-680b-4c9c-9db2-942690ea219b\"><strong>Hipgnosis Songs Fund</strong></a>, the London-listed repository of evergreen hits from the likes of <strong>Neil Young</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95a4307d-d61b-4b7c-927b-ae3c42f6d558\"><strong>Blondie</strong></a> and <strong>Fleetwood Mac</strong>, that Mercuriadis has used to complete dozens of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a47c24f-6fb1-4a3d-8a60-806c7d5dd8be\">acquisitions</a>. </p> <p>Nor should it be confused with <strong>Hipgnosis Song Management</strong>, the advisory vehicle that Mercuriadis uses to identify catalogues of hits for the fund to buy. Blackstone has also bought a stake in that business, hoping Hipgnosis pays off in multiple ways (though it won't say how big a stake or at what valuation).</p> <p>For Mercuriadis, this is validation of his often-made argument that old hits — and even misses — are worth a lot more in the age of streaming and social media. Songs like Fleetwood Mac's “Dreams”, which became a royalty-driving <strong>TikTok</strong> sensation, have boomed in value in recent years. </p> <p>The nine-figure sum that <strong>Universal Music Group</strong> paid to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/796d0bfc-c55e-4471-8e24-f84948d7a738\">buy out</a> <strong>Bob Dylan</strong>'s catalogue shows that there's still gold in the golden oldies. </p> <p>And the stakes have risen even higher in the hunt for coveted music rights. Blackstone and Hipgnosis will square off against investors like the French billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/876eaa70-a6dd-4922-9457-310dd7b0d032\"><strong>Vincent Bolloré</strong></a> and the hedge fund manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e819d8c9-2f0f-43f5-a652-1dd216da31f1\"><strong>Bill Ackman</strong></a>, who hold stakes in the newly independent Universal Music, as well as shareholders in the other top musical publishing houses <strong>Sony Music</strong> and <strong>Warner Music</strong>.</p> <p>Mercuriadis, now with two funds to sell into, has strengthened his hand. While the two funds won't compete against each other for deals, and can co-invest, it's not completely clear how decisions are made about which fund would buy into any given deal. “The bidding is mine,” Mercuriadis told the FT.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Emmanuel Faber</strong>, the former <strong>Danone</strong> chief executive and sustainability champion who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a768b96-69c6-42b7-8617-b3be606d6625\">ousted</a> from the French consumer goods group this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ed70156-14bc-4ba9-9dd5-4fbc986473a4\">has joined</a> agritech venture capital firm <strong>Astanor </strong>as a partner.</p></li>  <li><p>Wall Street veteran <strong>Bill Lewis</strong> is stepping down as investment banking chair of <strong>Lazard</strong>, where he worked for 17 years, to join<strong> Apollo Global Management</strong> as a senior partner. He will also join Lazard's board of directors in April.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Prepare for lift-off </strong>Before it has even launched, Elon Musk's new Starship rocket has already outflown its rivals in terms of technology and market control.
