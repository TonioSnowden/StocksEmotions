  "title": "IFF Nears Settlement Agreement With Carl Icahn; Deal would add a new director to the big ingredient maker's board",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Icahn has a roughly $600 million stake in IFF, which has a market value of around $33 billion, the people said.</p><p>An entity related to Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital also has an investment in IFF, the people said. It couldn't be learned which entity.</p><p>In 2019, chemical giant DuPont de Nemours Inc. reached a deal to combine its nutrition business with IFF, creating a company that would be a top supplier of ingredients to U.S. food makers. The company also provides soy proteins, probiotics, enzymes and other ingredients for creating scents and tastes for consumer products.</p><p>Shares of New York-based IFF have stagnated for the last five years, and since the DuPont deal the company has attracted several hedge funds and investors keen on monitoring its progress integrating the operations.</p><p>The company named a new chief executive officer in January, the same day CNBC reported that Mr. Icahn had a 4% stake. Former Merck &amp; Co. Inc. executive Frank Clyburn took over for Andreas Fibig, and the company also separated the role of CEO and chairman.</p><p>Another activist, Sachem Head Capital Management LP, reached a settlement agreement with IFF in March that gave its founder, Scott Ferguson, an option to join the board from September to December 2021, which he didn't exercise.</p><p>For Mr. Icahn, the IFF investment is a relatively friendly one, similar to an investment in utility FirstEnergy Corp., given his respect for Edward Breen, the DuPont chief executive who now sits on IFF's board, some of the people said.</p><p>3G, known for orchestrating the merger of Kraft and Heinz and other deal making, has been relatively quiet in recent years after the food company struggled to keep up with changing consumer tastes. But the investment firm made its first big splash in a while when it struck a $6.9 billion deal in December to buy a majority stake in Dutch window-coverings maker Hunter Douglas NV.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com</p><p>IFF Nears Settlement Agreement With Carl Icahn</p>",
