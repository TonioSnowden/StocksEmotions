  "title": "Everybody Dance: private equity celebrates boom times in Berlin",
  "text": "<h2>A dispatch from the frontline of global finance</h2> <p>The music is playing, and the private equity industry is dancing. </p> <p>Let us set the scene for you. It's a Berlin techno club-turned corporate events space, and <strong>Nile Rodgers</strong> and <strong>Chic</strong> are performing hits including “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-nC_HsH_4Y\">Good Times</a>”. </p> <p>We can't think of a better soundtrack for the mood of the crowd, a select group of private equity and venture capital financiers (though if you can, do <a href=\"mailto:due.diligence@ft.com\">get in touch</a>). As if to symbolise the industry's extravagance, their invitations came as plexiglass plaques in the post. </p> <p>The dealmakers at the private equity industry's <strong>SuperReturn</strong> conference have made so much money during the pandemic that they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca91ed95-77cc-4a0e-9196-cc29b4e6f9c4\">seemed incredulous at their good fortune</a>, reports DD's Kaye Wiggins who attended the event last week. </p> <p>“We as an industry are living in the best of times ever,” said <strong>Jan Stahlberg</strong>, who runs buyout group <strong>Trill Impact</strong>, during a panel discussion at the event.</p> <p>“I think probably everyone in this room is richer than ever, you probably make more money than ever, because asset valuations are going up.” Part of the reason, he said, was that private equity is “getting lots of benefits from the politicians”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Central banks' sweeping crisis measures gave private equity groups easy access to debt with which to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3091dd08-0301-424e-a049-7227a4883ef2\">buy more companies</a>, keep hard-hit ones afloat and even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9ff463b-01d7-4892-82dc-2dbb74941a16\">pay themselves dividends</a>. </p> <p>In a sign of how far the industry's reach has grown, it has even drawn Rodgers himself into its orbit: the business he co-founded with music mogul <strong>Merck Mercuriadis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f9ce243-d77a-44f6-a615-384eda335b42\">sold a $1bn stake</a> to <strong>Blackstone</strong> last month. (DD broke the deal down <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/854bebb2-c9ed-488f-9931-63017f547c6e\">here</a>.)</p> <p>Still, there were reasons to fret that the music might stop. One risk is political backlash. </p> <p>“We're benefiting massively [but] a lot of people have suffered in this crisis,” Stahlberg said. “That will be a political pressure.” A single audience member applauded.</p> <p>A senior private equity executive privately mused — using terms more commonly associated with <strong>Karl Marx</strong> than with capitalism's most forceful proponents — about how remarkable it was that he and his peers owned such a large share of the capital that workers generated with their labour.</p> <p>Interest rate rises, inflation, labour shortages and supply chain disruption all featured among risks to the industry's success, as did the prospect that its own use of leverage could lead to a downfall. </p> <p>Too many private equity groups had approached leverage the same way a child would approach a box of chocolates — by gorging — said <strong>KKR</strong>'s co-head of European private equity <strong>Philipp Freise</strong>. </p> <p>Still, for now, the party is great — even for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d34c5c4-ee9b-41a6-a1bc-6d2438343ed2\"><strong>Robert Smith</strong></a>, the billionaire founder of <strong>Vista Equity Partners</strong> who last year settled a criminal investigation by admitting to hiding $200m from the taxman offshore and evading some $43m in taxes. </p> <p>Smith was granted an onstage interview with a fellow private equity executive, <strong>Yann Robard</strong>, who describes himself as a longtime admirer of his interviewee. During the session, he called Smith an “outspoken advocate for social and economic justice”, without mentioning the criminal case, which he later told the FT would have been “inappropriate”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Do you ever take a moment, to savour the moment?” Robard asked.</p> <p>Smith's response: “I'm doing it right now.”</p> <h2>Elon Musk's unfiltered tweets come back to haunt</h2> <p>No conflict, no interest, or so the expression goes. </p> <p>On Monday, <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b49c3f4-890d-4c67-bda0-d0c8e71c3f69\">sued <strong>Tesla</strong></a> over a hedging transaction where the bank said that <strong>Elon Musk</strong>'s company stiffed it on a $162m settlement over warrants affected by the entrepreneur's infamous 2018 tweet about taking the electric carmaker private. </p> <p>In a court filing, JPMorgan said that warrants sold by Tesla had required the bank to adjust its terms after following Musk's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c381f68-c432-11e8-bc21-54264d1c4647\">tweet</a> that he was considering taking Tesla private at a $420 offer price — “Funding secured”.</p> <p>When the takeover never happened, the value of the warrants changed again, and JPMorgan had to change its position once more, it claimed.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1026872652290379776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F08%2F07%2Fbusiness%2Ftesla-stock-elon-musk-private.html\">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1026872652290379776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F08%2F07%2Fbusiness%2Ftesla-stock-elon-musk-private.html </a> <p>Such hedging transactions, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2714225e-e7de-4957-b10f-ce5c52586ec1\">Lex points out</a>, are not unusual. Banks help corporate clients every day with mundane, yet complex housekeeping matters. </p> <p>Tesla had similar hedging arrangements with other Wall Street houses, but none of those firms have sued the company. A footnote in the JPMorgan complaint offers an intriguing, yet unproven theory about the other banks' involvement in the 2018 ill-fated buyout proposal that led JPMorgan to re-evaluate the warrants:</p> <p>“Each of the other dealers may have been privy to non-public information about the going-private transaction, or otherwise may have declined to adjust their warrants for business reasons having nothing to do with the contractual terms or the reasonableness of JPMorgan's adjustments.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>JPMorgan is broaching the idea that either the other firms knew about the go-private idea in advance and hedged for it accordingly, or were happy with the deal fees Tesla might pay and were thus unwilling to pick a fight. </p> <p>Much like Musk and his unabashed Twitter fingers, JPMorgan boss <strong>Jamie Dimon </strong>has proven himself unafraid to wage a public confrontation.</p> <h2>The $8bn deal putting the EU's power to the test</h2> <p>“Killer acquisitions” has become a catchy phrase used in antitrust circles in Washington and Brussels in recent years after regulators cleared deals like <strong>Facebook</strong>'s purchase of <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, or<strong> Google</strong>'s acquisition of<strong> Fitbit</strong>.</p> <p>The logic goes that these tech giants are buying companies on the cheap to “kill” competition. Aware of this threat, EU regulators are set to formally press charges against&#xa0; <strong>Illumina</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a180e0a-9a88-43ed-b41f-19d2e360edfd\">acquisition</a> of <strong>Grail</strong> on Wednesday.</p> <p>Brussels is pursuing an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df9bf7bc-e839-420f-9905-fdfadfeb6bd1\">in-depth probe</a> on the $8bn deal on concerns that it will damage innovation and undermine competitors. </p> <p>Here's why it's controversial: Grail has no revenues in Europe, and therefore the EU should arguably have no jurisdiction. But EU regulators are testing their powers to see if they can claim jurisdiction on such deals in anticipation of Big Tech swooping in to acquire them and eliminate a potential rival in the process.</p> <p>Proponents of the EU's actions think this is a good way to prevent Silicon Valley's giants from getting away with murder, and further extending their dominant position in digital markets. Others argue that this could deter innovation, dashing founders' dreams of being bought by a larger competitor.</p> <p>Ahead of the formal charges, Illumina sent a paper (seen by DD) to national competition authorities arguing that Brussels has no legal basis to block the deal because it's not a merger of direct rivals, calling Brussels' accusations “highly speculative and unfounded by any evidence”.</p> <p>Expect a good fight.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Jeff Housenbold</strong>, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/591b5c94-9837-4e58-9a0f-977e2a67b54f\">former top executive</a> at <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund, has halted fundraising for his own venture capital fund and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8006629-1a8c-45c6-9336-fff3ee5404de\">will instead become</a> the head of<strong> Leaf Home</strong>, an Ohio-based gutter protection solutions company majority-owned by the private equity firm <strong>Gridiron Capital</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Gary Hoffman</strong>, chair of the <strong>Premier League</strong>, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48e7d7e4-c56d-4271-8bf5-4e435f087d47?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">set to quit</a> under pressure from clubs angry at his handling of the Saudi Arabia-led takeover of <strong>Newcastle United</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Andreessen Horowitz </strong>has promoted <strong>Jon Lai </strong>to general partner and hired gaming industry veteran <strong>James Gwertzman</strong> as a general partner on its consumer investing team.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has hired <strong>Jefferson Rives </strong>as a managing director in its healthcare investment banking division.
