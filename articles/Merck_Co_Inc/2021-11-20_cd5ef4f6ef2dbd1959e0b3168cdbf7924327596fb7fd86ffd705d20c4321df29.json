  "text": "<p>Beyond that, the administration is reviewing whether Paxlovid, the antiviral from Pfizer , can be available on the commercial market in retail pharmacies if it gets regulatory clearance, the person said. Supply of the antivirals should become more plentiful by April or May.</p><p>The federal government could make the antivirals available in the commercial market via regulatory action. It would likely take congressional action for the medications to be covered by Medicare and Medicaid because emergency use authorization may not provide for reimbursement.</p><p>Pfizer this week asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clear the antiviral for use. A decision could come before the end of the year.</p><p>Should regulators clear Paxlovid, Pfizer would begin delivery of the drug this year, according to the company and President Biden.</p><p>The availability on the commercial market, which typically happens for products after they receive full FDA approval, could also be expanded to include molnupiravir, an oral pill from Merck &amp; Co . and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP that is also under review by the FDA , the person said. An outside panel of experts to the FDA is scheduled to review molnupiravir's application this month.</p><p>The government plans to allocate antiviral drugs to states through a similar system to how it began with doses of Covid-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, although it will be shipped via wholesalers and not the drugmakers themselves, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Currently, if the drug receives clearance under an emergency use, distribution would be directed by the U.S. government and supply would be limited to the 10 million courses procured. Under the proposed changes, Pfizer and Merck would be allowed to sell and distribute their pills the way they normally do with other medicines once supply increases.</p><p>No decision has been made and the goal is to ensure equitable distribution and access, the person said.</p><p>FDA clearance of an oral pill would be a turning point in the treatment of Covid-19 because people can take the therapies at home shortly after they develop symptoms and can avoid becoming hospitalized. Authorized treatments such as antibody therapies are primarily given to people in hospitals and physicians' offices.</p><p>Paxlovid was found in a late-stage trial to be safe and cut the risk of hospitalization or death in high-risk people with mild to moderate Covid-19 by about 89% if they took the pill within three days of diagnosis, according to Pfizer .</p><p>Under the terms of the Pfizer deal announced Thursday, the government will pay about $529 for each course of treatment, consisting of 30 pills over five days. Twice a day, patients would take two pills of Paxlovid and one pill of another antiviral called ritonavir.</p><p>The Paxlovid price is below the approximate $700 per course of treatment the U.S. agreed to pay for the Merck-Ridgeback drug. The U.S. has agreed to purchase 3.1 million courses of molnupiravir.</p><p>The administration plans to provide antivirals free of charge with the courses it has already agreed to purchase, and supply is expected to be tight until spring, the person said. Commercial sales would likely occur as supply increases, the person said, and the administration is pushing drugmakers to increase manufacturing.</p>",
