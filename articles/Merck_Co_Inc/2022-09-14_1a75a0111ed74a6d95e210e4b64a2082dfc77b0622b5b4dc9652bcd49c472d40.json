Join us in London on October 12 at our first annual summit — Due Diligence Live — to hear from Jonathan Kanter, the head of the Department of Justice's antitrust division, on that and more.

The financialisation of song catalogues has taken off in the past few years. &#xa0;</p> <p>Among the pioneers of the practice is <strong>Merck Mercuriadis</strong>, the one-time manager of <strong>Beyoncé</strong> and <strong>Elton John </strong>who in 2018 launched his London-listed fund <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Fund </strong>as a vehicle to buy songs, pitching them to institutional investors as a way to generate reliable, bond-like returns. </p> <p>Today Wall Street firms are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e879f856-3ec3-4bd7-b564-ada5b590e3ef\">pouring cash into music funds at a record pace</a>. That has been particularly good for <strong>Barry Massarsky</strong>, a specialist pop music number cruncher described as an eternal optimist by people who have worked with him. </p> <p>Massarsky has resisted raising the so-called discount rate in his calculations to reflect central banks' rate rises. If he raised it, it would cut the value of tens of thousands of songs, potentially wreaking havoc for the financial engineers who have used debt towards buying them. </p> <p>Mercuriadis, a smooth-talking middleman between suit-clad investors and mercurial musicians, is already in a difficult spot. </p> <p>As DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b1beaf8-a1be-4be5-9d89-9770571929fb\">explained last week</a>, his original, London-listed fund is effectively frozen. A drop in its share price means it can no longer raise money, and royalties generated by its current catalogue have been falling for at least the past two years, since the numbers were first disclosed. To cap it all off, rising interest rates are making its $600mn debt pile more expensive. </p> <p>Still, Wall Street isn't giving up easily.</p> <p>Private equity titan <strong>Blackstone </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66ba0aa3-4787-42c5-a024-e54bd0058bb0\">bought <strong>Hipgnosis Song Management</strong>,</a> Mercuriadis's management company that advises the listed fund, last year. The firm also set up a separate $1bn fund, <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Capital</strong>, to buy more songs including<strong> Leonard Cohen</strong>'s catalogue.</p> <p>Blackstone's rivals are also building their own musical empires.<strong> KKR</strong> is backing <strong>Chord Music Partners</strong>. Carlyle, which helped finance a $300mn acquisition of <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>'s former record label in 2019 in a deal led by Kardashian's new business partner <strong>Jay Sammons</strong>, has committed<a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/music/news/hank-forsyth-dan-mccarroll-launch-litmus-carlyle-global-credit-1235333125/\"> $500mn to buying songs</a> — even after the Swift transaction <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a4f9fe-0e6b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">escalated into a dramatic feud</a>.</p> <p>One reason private equity remains all-in on music is the belief that certain catalogues have the longevity to transcend market slumps. Music is relatively immune to supply chain risk, geopolitical risk and inflation, a senior private equity executive said. </p> <p>Then there's the chance that, if things go south for Mercuriadis's listed fund, Blackstone — which does not use Massarsky to value the catalogues in its private fund — would be well placed to pick up its catalogues at a discount. </p> <p>Hipgnosis has a 50 per cent stake in<strong> Mariah Carey</strong>'s 1994 hit “All I Want for Christmas is You”. Blackstone, which makes money every time <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>'s “SexyBack” plays in a nightclub, might jump at the chance to snag it in time for the holidays.</p> <h1>All aboard the Mooch</h1> <p>When a Disney cruise ship docked in the Bahamas, <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong> was hoping for his own fairytale ending. </p> <p>He wanted to meet with 30-year-old billionaire <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the founder of <strong>FTX</strong>, who has recently become a sort of “lender of last resort” for failed crypto firms. </p> <p>Over a long lunch, the two men hashed out a deal for Bankman-Fried to buy a stake in <strong>SkyBridge</strong>, Scaramucci's $2.8bn in assets investment firm which has traditionally been focused on hedge funds but has in recent years pivoted towards cryptocurrencies. </p> <p>Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57407389-a4c6-4d93-91c4-014853748540\">agreed to pay about $45mn</a> for a 30 per cent stake in SkyBridge, giving the firm a valuation of approximately $150mn, DD's Ortenca Aliaj and the FT's Madison Darbyshire and Joshua Oliver report. Bankman-Fried also has a three-year option to buy up to 85 per cent of the firm — Scaramucci would own the remaining 15 per cent. </p> <p>But there's a catch. Scaramucci has to use the majority of the proceeds, $40mn to be exact, for long-term investments in cryptocurrencies. </p> <p>Talking to reporters at his annual Salt conference in New York, Scaramucci joked that he had proposed lunch with Bankman-Fried to avoid going to the water park with his children. The reality is that he wanted to prove to people the firm isn't going out of business. </p> <p>“If I was doing super-well right now . . . who knows if we would be doing the transaction,” he said. </p> <p>To his point, one of SkyBridge's crypto-dedicated funds has suspended redemptions so investors can't pull their cash out. </p> <p>Scaramucci, who famously lasted 11 days as White House communications director under <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, insists this is temporary. He has every faith that the crypto market will recover and has compared Bankman-Fried to <strong>John Pierpont Morgan</strong>.</p> <p>“He is bailing out cryptocurrency markets the way the original JPMorgan did after the crisis of 1907,” he told Bloomberg in June. </p> <p>If it doesn't work out, Scaramucci seems resigned to a fate that befalls many flamed out Wall Streeters: spending more time with his family. </p> <p>“Either they're right and I'm fucking dead, or I'm right and I'm going to the fucking moon,” he said.</p> <h1>A borrowing binge of monstrous proportions</h1> <p>What do an Indian mining company, a Belgian toilet maker and Britain's largest chicken producer have in common?</p> <p>Answer: they all feature in the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5a807a5-a65f-4885-ab5f-871d545e36a3\">new list of “debt monsters”</a>.</p> <p>The round-up features 200-plus heavily indebted companies whose bond spreads are flashing a red warning signal: their debt is trading at a yield more than 10 percentage points (1,000 basis points) above government bonds.</p> <p>The disparate group of borrowers — ranging from<strong> Allen Media</strong> to <strong>Zhenro Properties</strong> — shows just how widespread corporate distress has become in 2022, as central banks have increased rates to tame surging inflation.</p> <p>In <strong>Ernest Hemingway</strong>'s novel <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>, an alcoholic war veteran sets out the two ways he went bankrupt: “Gradually, then suddenly.”</p> <p>While many companies on the list will probably avoid that fate, it includes lots of businesses whose dive into distress has happened “gradually, then suddenly”, such as the heavily indebted Chinese property companies that until recently seemed to defy the laws of financial gravity.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Former <strong>Sky</strong> finance chief <strong>Andrew Griffith </strong>will lead the UK government's financial services reforms, including sweeping plans to overhaul former Brussels insurance rules.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Grindr</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eae248d2-53e0-4e44-a177-e996eb9e8fc9\">has shaken up its top management</a> as it prepares to go public through a black-cheque merger slated for later this year. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ares</strong> has hired<strong> Apollo Global Management </strong>veteran <strong>James Kim</strong> as a partner and head of <strong>European special opportunities</strong>, based in London.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> has appointed <strong>Michael Lamach</strong>, the former CEO and chair of <strong>Trane Technologies</strong>, as an operating adviser to <strong>CD&amp;R </strong>funds.</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity firm <strong>HIG Capital </strong>has appointed <strong>Patrick Conroy</strong>, based in New York, and <strong>Hans Sherman</strong>, based in Boston, as managing directors of its growth investment affiliate.
