  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>“The European economy is moving from recovery to expansion but is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33572de-946c-47a6-afb1-5ef87d1aeef0\">facing some headwinds</a>,” said Paolo Gentiloni, the EU's economics commissioner, in this week's autumn update from Brussels.</p> <p>Gentiloni outlined three specific threats. Rising inflation, driven mainly by surging energy prices, and supply chain disruptions will be familiar themes for Road To Recovery readers. But the third, and most worrying, was the marked increase in new Covid infections, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, making Europe once again the epicentre of the pandemic. </p> <p>Today's announcement from Austria of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e686eac-c78c-4e43-8bd6-a909107a2a87\">lockdown of the unvaccinated</a> is the latest development in a week of bad news about the resurgence of the virus and its effect on economic recovery, although new restrictions are thought unlikely to cause as much damage as they did at the height of the pandemic. </p> <p>Austria, which has one of the lowest rates of vaccination in Europe, this week recorded its highest infection numbers of the entire crisis, with a rolling seven-day average of 9,593 a day, beating the previous high from a year ago of 7,464. Germany today added the country to its list of “high-risk” nations alongside Romania, Croatia, Latvia, the UK and the US.</p> <p>Germany itself this week also recorded its highest incidence of infection since the start of the pandemic, highlighting the fact that the country is now firmly in the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-18872b2b-335d-425a-b641-6cddf2916f3b\"> grip of a fourth wave</a>. The seven-day incidence rate — which reached 263 people per 100,000 on Friday — is now at a historic high for the fifth consecutive day.</p> <p>Economists worry that new restrictions will affect German consumer activity and exacerbate the supply chain problems that are already hurting industrial output, a serious problem in a country where manufacturing is so important. The country's Council of Economic Experts, which advises the government, on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdef3d1f-917b-4920-9d9b-ee5f62b9b3c8\">cut its forecasts for growth</a>.</p> <p>Concern is spreading across Europe. The Netherlands is on the point of reintroducing partial lockdown; Denmark is poised to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdd86e1d-ec1a-4bad-8b9d-c77aec36728a\">reintroduce Covid passports</a> as its parliament designates the virus a “critical threat to society”; and France's president Emmanuel Macron has announced that over-65s will need <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/152d589d-5d9b-4b63-ab45-47e0ffcf4e17\">booster jabs</a> if they want to eat out or make long-distance journeys from next month.</p> <p>Vaccine hesitancy is also slowing the take-up of jabs across the continent, especially in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f04ac67b-92e4-4bab-8c23-817cc0483df5\">German-speaking countries</a>, where protesters proclaiming “Nein danke” are spreading via groups such as Germany's <em>Querdenker </em>or lateral thinkers.</p> <p>While the debate about how best to protect populations during a pandemic is still raging — as you can read in our interview today with the architect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c07de5f-e852-4c23-823b-5f8f7d18ebef\">Sweden's “no lockdown” policy</a> — one academic suggests that public health messaging in German-speaking countries has been too dispassionate. “It has been functional rather than emotional,” she said, allowing conspiracy theories to fill the void. “They are often easier for [uninformed] people to believe,” she added.</p> <p>The fierce backlash to today's announcement in Austria also underlines concerns that vaccination is becoming a key battleground between Europe's political mainstream and rightwing populism. The country's far-right Freedom party accused the government of “corona fascism” and said that “all forms of resistance . . . are now needed”.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>A record 4.4m Americans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b35232-262c-47bb-b5c0-5551ef74353b#post-0a89d86e-77bb-4303-bfdb-1d11b1b207e0\">quit their jobs</a> in September while the number of job openings remained near record highs as businesses struggled to fill vacancies</p></li>  <li><p>Coffee prices hit a seven-year high as poor weather, freight problems and higher fertiliser costs threatened to curb supply (Bloomberg)</p></li>  <li><p>Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum vowed to address economic recovery by shoring up supply chains and tackling labour issues as well as responding to the pandemic (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b35232-262c-47bb-b5c0-5551ef74353b\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>UK hospitality</strong> remains “in peril” according to the industry's trade body, as new data showed sales in restaurants, bars and hotels <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac6266ed-3977-4d51-88bf-d60768ee8c7a\">10 per cent below pre-Covid levels</a>, despite increased spending per customer. Profit margins have been cut by a third since post-lockdown reopenings, while staff shortages mean the cost of labour could increase by up to 13 per cent next year. Our detailed analysis of the UK's <strong>1m plus job vacancies</strong> showed hospitality was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/540cb844-3d53-4110-8aa7-526094d6ae83\">worst hit sector</a> after health and social care.</p> <p>Latest examples of hospitality woes include the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61b7cb66-cec8-4338-b683-1332696a519f\">dent in sales</a> caused by the reluctance of older punters to return to <strong>Wetherspoons</strong> pubs, and a severe <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d118350-ba42-43bb-9300-b81996227f5c\">shortage of drivers</a> in the UK arm of <strong>Uber</strong>, after drivers either quit during the pandemic or decided that rising car and fuel costs made working for the ride-hailing company increasingly uneconomical.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>Downward revisions for August and July meant <strong>UK economic growth</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a2b313e-75f6-422b-bd06-48ee2532f02e\">slowed more than expected</a> in the third quarter, despite picking up in September, according to official data published yesterday. September's growth of 0.6 per cent suggests the economy has largely recovered from Covid-19 restrictions, but the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dd0e1ea-ff44-48c4-a8c1-8eb895b3ce4d\">devil is in the detail</a>, as economics editor Chris Giles explains.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>A surge in spending over the Diwali festival period has fuelled hopes that <strong>India</strong> will regain its place as the world's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/519e6445-bab5-4afe-83d1-d32691f7dff5\">fastest-growing large economy</a>. Although activity has rebounded sharply, helped by a big drop in daily Covid-19 cases to about 11,000 from 40,000 in May, there are fears that rising prices could yet stymie consumer demand and coal shortages could hit industrial output. </p> <p>Investment expert Mohamed El-Erian argues that the hesitancy of the <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> in tackling inflation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b3f9d33-974a-4b52-b237-e17e0283550a\">risks hurting the poor</a>.</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> became the latest country to report a surge in producer prices as new data showed them rising at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d1c1e15-7366-4158-bd79-f5102ee01f8e#post-1da9368b-cc88-4018-928c-f34a5f6f720f\">fastest pace in 40 years</a>. </p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>AstraZeneca </strong>said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cae4eb5f-1369-4eec-88ec-6fd3afe352ab\">move away from the non-profit model</a> for its Covid-19 jab vaccine, apart from its use in developing countries. “Modest profitability” from sales in the fourth quarter will be used to invest in its antibody treatment. The company earlier announced it was creating&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36cbdad9-7dd9-4ba5-a4ef-818c41cfadb3\">vaccine and immune therapies</a> unit to bring together its Covid-19 products and other treatments for viral respiratory illnesses. Huge sales at other vaccine manufacturers have invigorated calls from politicians to share their technology <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd133d09-3cec-414d-a4da-9631e5d234a4\">with poorer countries</a>. </p> <p><strong>UK retailers</strong> have experienced big <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ddefc90-cebb-46c5-ab77-84b2a3e4d63a\">gains in productivity</a> from the pivot to online sales that has been accelerated by the pandemic. Unit labour costs in the second quarter of this year were 3 per cent below the average for 2019 while output per hour was around 10 per cent higher, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The boom in steel prices spurred by global recovery gave <strong>ArcelorMittal</strong> its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02ee6852-92ab-4684-abe3-9f1bef15a0e8\">biggest quarterly profit since 2008</a>. The Luxembourg-based group reported profits of $6.1bn, almost 20 per cent cent higher than in the second quarter, and increased its share buyback by an extra $1bn.</p> <h1>Science round-up</h1> <p><strong>Pandemic control:</strong> While the situation in mainland Europe is causing concern, there was better news from England, where the number of infections <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b35232-262c-47bb-b5c0-5551ef74353b#post-789882e5-1db3-46ae-aba8-547fa9d0fbec\">continued to drop.</a> Officials in China however warned of a “complex and grave challenge this winter and next spring” as new coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ad85000-6fb1-474e-8bc7-949139aa0124\">continue to spread</a> in the broadest outbreak since the early days of the pandemic.
