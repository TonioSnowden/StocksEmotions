The new estimates account for greater vaccine usage, including a third booster shot as part of the primary series.</p><p>“We continue to see COVID-19 revenues declining over time, but we do not see that starting to happen until 2023/2024 versus our prior estimate of 2022,” Harrison wrote in a note to clients. “We have also added in the potential for a combination COVID/respiratory vaccine.”</p><p>He reiterated his equal weight rating on the stock, as his price target is about 23% below current levels. “While we believe there is long-term upside for Moderna, we believe the significant valuation increase associated with the success of the COVID-19 vaccine limits the near-term upside,” Harrison wrote.</p><p>The stock has rocketed 703.1% over the past 12 months, while shares of J&amp;J have gained 17.0% and of Pfizer Inc. PFE, which also has a COVID-19 vaccine along with its partner BioNTech SE BNTX, have advanced 37.4%.

He said while management is likely to keep driving upside for it key cancer treatment Keytruda, he doesn't believe investors will pay for that upside given concerns over lack of loss-of-exclusivity (LOE) diversification.</p><p>“Investors are not convinced that the current pipeline assets, including HIV drug islatravir and early oncology assets, are enough to offset the Keytruda cliff at the end of the decade given pivotal data will not read out until 2024-2025,” Harrison wrote.</p><p>The stock closed Tuesday down 1.7% at $75.98.</p><p>Amgen's stock shed 2.2% to $221.34, the lowest close since late December.</p><p>Harrison also cut his rating to equal weight from overweight, while also slashing his price target to $251 from $280.</p><p>“Our new thesis is based on a more balanced risk/reward as investors focus on the mid-decade LOEs for Evenity, XGENA and Prolia, offset by continued pipeline progress,” Harrison wrote.</p><p>Among other ratings moves, Harrison also downgraded argenx SE ARGXBE:ARGXto equal weight from overweight, and Genmab A/S GMABDK:GMAB and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
