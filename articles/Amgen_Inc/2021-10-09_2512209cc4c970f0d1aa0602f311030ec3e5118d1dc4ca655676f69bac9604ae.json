  "text": "<p>   DNA tests can already help people understand their predispositions for some cancers, and more research will uncover other risk factors. At the same time, drug makers are developing therapies such as mRNA vaccines that are personalized for the genomic profile of a cancer. </p><p>   Blood tests could also soon be used to scan for biomarkers of recurrence. Grail has formed partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb to monitor for residual cancer cells after treatment. \"I truly believe that, within our lifetime, we can make a significant dent in cancer survival rates, and a lot of that will come through the work that's done in genomics.\" Let's hope regulators don't kill the cures in the crib. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Finley is a member of the Journal's editorial board. </p><p></p>",
