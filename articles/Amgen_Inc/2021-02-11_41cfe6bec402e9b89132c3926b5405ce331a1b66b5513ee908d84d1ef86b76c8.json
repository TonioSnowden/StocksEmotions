  "text": "<p>   A combination of two Eli Lilly &amp; Co. antibody-based drugs to treat recently diagnosed Covid-19 was authorized by federal health regulators, the latest treatment aimed to help people at high risk of severe disease from avoiding hospitalization. </p><p>   The move by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday night allows doctors to add a new monoclonal antibody, named etesevimab, to one called bamlanivimab that the agency authorized last year. </p><p>   The combination, administered together via a single intravenous infusion, is cleared for patients who are at high risk of worsening to severe Covid-19, including those 65 and older or who have certain medical conditions. </p><p>    Monoclonal antibodies are engineered proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off viruses. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. makes a similar antibody-based Covid-19 treatment that previously received FDA authorization. </p><p>   Companies are developing Covid-19 antibody treatments that are more convenient to take and can tackle emerging virus mutations. </p><p>   Lilly co-developed bamlanivimab with Canadian company AbCellera Biologics Inc. It was derived from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients to recover from Covid-19. Lilly licensed the second antibody, etesevimab, from Junshi Biosciences of China. </p><p>   A 1,035-person study found that the two-drug cocktail reduced the combined risk of death and hospitalization by 70% compared with patients who received a placebo. Some 7% of patients in the study who received the placebo died or were hospitalized for Covid-19, versus 2% of those who received the Lilly combination. Some patients had side effects including certain allergic reactions. </p><p>   Lilly and its manufacturing partner Amgen Inc. plan to make up to one million doses of etesevimab by mid-2021. About 100,000 doses are ready immediately and an additional 150,000 are expected to be available throughout the first quarter, Lilly said. </p><p>   The U.S. government previously agreed to purchase 950,000 doses of the first Lilly antibody, bamlanivimab, and has directed the allocation of doses to health-care providers. Lilly said Tuesday it expects the procurement and allocation of the new two-antibody cocktail to mirror the same process. </p><p></p>",
