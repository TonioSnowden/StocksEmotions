  "text": "<p>   \"A judge has to be on her toes, and obviously I was not,\" Judge Wright said. </p><p>   Judges with many conflicts are \"either being careless or have people working for them who are not exercising due diligence,\" she said, though she added that judges bear the ultimate responsibility for steering clear of conflicts. </p><p>   Judge Donald Graham in Florida held American depositary receipts of Alcatel-Lucent while assigned to a case involving the French telecom maker. He sold the ADRs in 2010, a day after he approved a $45 million civil settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the firm over allegations the company bribed foreign officials. The company neither admitted nor denied the allegations. </p><p>   After being contacted by the Journal, Judge Graham notified the court clerk of the violation. In a publicly filed letter to the parties, the clerk said Judge Graham's holding didn't affect his decisions. </p><p>   A lawyer for the SEC told the court it didn't believe any further action was required. Nokia Corp., Alcatel-Lucent's current owner,  declined to comment. </p><p>   Judge Benjamin Settle in Washington state sold as much as $15,000 of Amgen Inc. stock during a case that was settled in 2012. He sold the stock in 2008, while the suit was under seal, giving him access to nonpublic information about an allegation of kickbacks to doctors. The case contributed to a $762 million penalty against the biotech company in 2012. </p><p>   Judge Settle said he hadn't included all his holdings on his recusal list when he inherited the case in 2007 as a newly commissioned federal judge. \"Amgen was among those mistakenly omitted,\" he said. </p><p>   Judge Settle said he directed his broker in 2008 to sell all of his stocks. Amgen declined to comment. </p><p>   The Journal's tally of recusal violations is likely an undercount. In Mississippi, Judge Sharion Aycock's  husband owned as much as $15,000 in shares of Dollar General Corp. at a time when the Journal found two cases she heard involving the retailer. After being asked about it, she found five more violations involving Dollar General and notified the clerk about all seven. </p><p>   A few judges with violations the Journal identified had legendary careers, including Jack Weinstein and Arthur Spatt in the Eastern District of New York. </p><p>   Judge Weinstein oversaw four cases involving Medtronic PLC or Target Corp. while he or his family held their shares. Judge Spatt had a violation involving Johnson &amp; Johnson. Judge Spatt died in 2020 and Judge Weinstein died earlier this year, both having served into their 90s. </p><p>   Judge Margo Brodie, chief of the Eastern District, acknowledged the conflicts but said the judges' \"involvement was minimal,\" limited to actions such as approving settlements. \"These two judges have been revered by the practicing bar for their integrity and even handedness,\" she said. </p><p>   The Journal identified 36 conflicts by a judge in Colorado, R. Brooke Jackson. The cases included Apple, Chevron Corp., Eli Lilly, Facebook Inc., General Electric Co., Home Depot, Honeywell International Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, JPMorgan, Pfizer and Wells Fargo. </p><p>   Reached by phone, Judge Jackson said he had no idea which stocks he owns, as a money manager handles them and his wife fills out his disclosure forms. He said because he doesn't know, he couldn't have a conflict of interest. </p><p>   \"I've never really paid much attention to it,\" Judge Jackson said of the investments. \"I have preferred to stay unknowledgeable about it.\" </p><p>   In a later email, he said: \"I am taking immediate steps to provide a current list of stocks and other investments held by my wife and by me to our Clerk's Office so that we can create an appropriate conflicts list and be sure that this does not happen again.\" </p><p>   In a subsequent 21-page letter to the Journal, Judge Jackson said he should have recused himself in most if not all of the 36 cases. \"I am embarrassed that I did not properly understand and apply the stock ownership rule,\" he wrote. \"Being informed of what could be viewed as an ethical violation, even a technical one, is no fun.\" </p><p>   Judge David Norton in South Carolina presided over six asbestos suits beginning in 2012 while his disclosures show he held $95,004 to $250,000 of stock in two defendants, 3M Co. and GE. </p><p>   In 2015 he heard a case filed by James Chesher, who alleged he developed cancer from exposure to asbestos in the Navy. Mr. Chesher and his wife sought damages from 3M, GE and about two dozen others. They reached settlements with 3M and GE in 2016. </p><p>   Mr. Chesher died in 2017. His widow, Cheryl Ann Chesher, was surprised to learn from the Journal of the judge's  interests in GE and 3M. \"He should have policed himself,\" she said. \"He knows what the law is on that.\" </p><p>   Judge Norton said he didn't recuse himself because 3M and GE played no significant role in the suits and were \"defendants in name only.\" </p><p>   He added: \"At the outset the lawyers involved in these cases assured me that 3M and GE would be dismissed and not involved in the case pursuant to a pre-existing agreement between the plaintiffs' lawyers and GE and 3M.\" </p><p>   Peter Kraus, an attorney for the Cheshers, said he and his co-counsel had no recollection of assuring the judge  GE and 3M would be dismissed. They \"were certainly not 'defendants in name only,' \" he said, adding that attorneys for both companies participated in depositions. </p><p>   A 3M spokeswoman said neither the company nor its attorneys ever assured the judge regarding any dismissals. A spokeswoman for GE didn't respond to questions about whether it had conveyed such an assurance. An attorney for GE said she didn't recall the case. </p><p>   Told what 3M and the plaintiffs' attorney said, Judge Norton reiterated his recollection of the case. </p><p>   As remaining asbestos defendants moved toward trial, Judge Norton issued rulings that broadly benefited companies with asbestos liabilities. </p><p>   In hearings, he took aim at the theory behind the cases: that any exposure to asbestos was significant enough to contribute to cancer. The defendants said the plaintiffs' expert witness shouldn't be allowed to testify because he was unable to show that the men more likely than not would have avoided the disease but for their exposure to the asbestos. Judge Norton sided with the companies, ruling that the expert witness's testimony -- \"scientifically sound as it may be\" -- couldn't be presented to a jury. </p><p>   The ruling drew national attention. Plaintiffs' lawyers denounced it, while lawyers who often defend corporations embraced it as common-sense analysis. A Harvard Law Review article blasted it, saying that \"unrealistic legal expectations of science could do great injustice.\" </p><p>   Mr. Kraus, the Cheshers's attorney, called the decision out of sync with court precedent on liability in asbestos cases. Other courts have adopted Judge Norton's analysis, including the Ohio Supreme Court. </p><p>   Mr. Kraus said he has never asked to see a judge's financial disclosure form. He said he wasn't sure he ever would. </p><p>   \"If a judge who is considering a matter you have before him finds out that you've been snooping around about his finances, I'd be very concerned as a practitioner that it would cause a negative backlash that would affect my clients' rights in the court,\" Mr. Kraus said. </p><p>   Judge Norton also violated an ethics rule when he bought a box of cuff links at an auction of the government-seized property of a man he earlier sentenced to prison for a Ponzi scheme, according to the chief judge of the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. </p><p>   \"The judge's purchase did create an appearance of impropriety,\" though it didn't affect the sentence imposed, Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote in 2017, without identifying the cuff links buyer. </p><p>   Judge Gregory quoted the unnamed judge as saying he tried to \"keep current on all ethical rules and take the yearly ethics test prepared by the Administrative office\" but was unaware that his participation in the auction could create the appearance of impropriety. </p><p>   Judge Norton, who confirmed in a separate filing that he bought the cuff links, told the Fourth Circuit: \"Now that I have been made aware of this, my actions will not be repeated.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ava Sasani and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
