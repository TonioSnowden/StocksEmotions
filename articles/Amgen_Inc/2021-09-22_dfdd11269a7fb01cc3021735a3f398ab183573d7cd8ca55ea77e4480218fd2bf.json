  "title": "Cancer Ordeal Inspired a Pharmaceutical Career; Gisela Schwab, who has died at age 65, emigrated from Germany to the U.S. and led drug development at Exelixis",
  "text": "<p>That career reached its peak at Exelixis Inc., a biotechnology company based in Alameda, Calif., that has developed drugs used in treating kidney, liver and thyroid cancers. She joined Exelixis in 2006 and became chief medical officer and head of product development.</p><p>She oversaw clinical trials and found the job required patience and resilience. \"This is a field where failure is more common than success,\" she said in a 2019 podcast.</p><p>Dr. Schwab was beginning to think about retirement when she was diagnosed last year with lung cancer. She received a certificate of U.S. citizenship in July while lying in a hospital bed.</p><p>Dr. Schwab died Sept. 3 at her home in Hayward, Calif. She was 65 and is survived by her Dutch-born husband, David Thomassen, two golden retrievers and three cats.</p><p>Gisela Margarete Schwab, the second of three children, was born April 27, 1956, in Munich and grew up in Erlangen. Her parents were lawyers.</p><p>She received her medical degree at Heidelberg University and trained at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.</p><p>At Exelixis, she supervised about 350 drug-development employees. She had previous executive roles at Amgen Inc. and Abgenix Inc. She was a director at Genocea Biosciences Inc. and Nordic Nanovector ASA.</p><p>\"She had a very soft touch,\" said Michael M. Morrissey, chief executive of Exelixis, adding that Dr. Schwab was humble and good at building consensus. She had a \"50-year relationship with cancer\" as a patient, physician and researcher, he said.</p><p>Dr. Schwab met Dr. Thomassen, a pharmacologist, at a Halloween party in 1989 in Bethesda, Md. They decided to get married in March 1991 and did so a week later at a courthouse. \"Our parents in Europe we called the next day,\" said Dr. Thomassen. At home, they spoke a blend of English, German and Dutch.</p><p>Her husband said Dr. Schwab chose drug development over clinical practice after \"she saw too many of her patients die because of a lack of drugs that work.\" She chose to spend most of her career in the U.S. because \"the U.S. is to drug development what New York was to Sinatra; if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
