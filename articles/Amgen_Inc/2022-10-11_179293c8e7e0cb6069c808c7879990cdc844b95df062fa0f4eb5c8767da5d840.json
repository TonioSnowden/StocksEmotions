Here's what it's saying now.</p><p>The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y on Tuesday pulled back after rising above 4.3%, near its highest level since 2007. The short-duration benchmark was nearly 400 basis points lower a year ago before the Fed embarked on a rate hiking campaign to tackle consumer price rises running at their fastest pace in 40-years.

The benchmark is already down 24.2% so far in 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has shed 32.6% over the same period and sits at its lowest since July 2020.</p><p>\"With the U.S. 10-year yield back at the 4% level this morning, we expect the pressure to continue in U.S. equities and our thesis is also that the upcoming Q3 earnings season starting this week will lead to earnings downgrades and disappointments in the outlook,\" said Peter Ganry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.</p><p>Deep Dive: The stock market is in trouble. That's because the the bond market is 'very close to a crash.'</p><p>JPMorgan Chase on Friday will help kick off the third-quarter corporate earnings season alongside peers Citigroup C and Morgan Stanley MS. Analysts expect S&amp;P 500 index aggregate earnings will grow by 4.5% for the period, though much of this is driven by an expected 6.3% gain for energy stocks, according to Refinitiv. Financials' earnings are forecast to fall 1.6%.</p><p>The market must contend with U.S. producer prices data on Wednesday and the consumer prices data on Thursday, reports that should further impact investors' thinking on the Fed's policy trajectory.</p><p>The dollar DXY has been propelled sharply higher by the Fed's relatively aggressive rate-hiking cycle, and the currency's strength is seen as yet another headwind for the earnings of U.S. multinationals.
