He will walk away with his investment in a Latin American fund SoftBank raised that was overseen by Mr. Claure, a stake currently valued at about $300 million that could grow over time if the bets pay off, one of the people said. He will also receive severance of between $30 million and $50 million, this person added.</p><p>California Teachers Pension to Double Down on Direct Deals</p><p>The California State Teachers' Retirement System aims to nearly double the size of its direct private investment program over the next five years and it plans to lean more heavily on investment staff to get there, WSJ Pro reports. On Thursday, trustees of the $327.7 billion California pension, also known as Calstrs, approved policy changes that give its private-equity investment staff authority to approve larger investments directly in companies alongside fund sponsors and expand the types of opportunities staff can consider. \"A road map was laid out in 2018 for the collaborative model as it relates to private equity and it focused on a vastly enlarged co-investment program with increasing levels of sophistication and complexity, and these revisions we're recommending are just more steps along that plan,\" Margot Wirth, director of private equity, told the pension overseers.</p><p>TCV Delves Deeper Into Startup Territory With New Strategy</p><p>Technology Crossover Ventures is forging deeper into the realm of startups with its newly formed Velocity team and a $460 million fund dedicated to the strategy, Ted Bunker reports for WSJ Pro.

General Partner Tim McAdam said a review of roughly 1,000 deals in which TCV had the option to join revealed that in some cases it passed up a chance for big gains.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Share this email with a friend.</p><p>Forward ›</p><p>Forwarded this email by a friend?</p><p>Sign Up Here ›</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Obvious Ventures seeks to raise $400 million for Obvious Ventures IV LP and $125 million for Obvious Prime II LP, according to regulatory filings.
