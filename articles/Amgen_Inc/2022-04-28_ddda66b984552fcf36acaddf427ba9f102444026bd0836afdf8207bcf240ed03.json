  "title": "Business News:  Amgen  Gets IRS  Bill For  $7 Billion  ----  By Joseph Walker",
  "text": "<p>   Amgen Inc. has been hit with a bill for more than $7 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties from the Internal Revenue Service, the company said Wednesday, the latest salvo in a dispute over back taxes related to operations in Puerto Rico. </p><p>   Amgen said it received a notice from the IRS on April 18 that seeks to increase Amgen's federal taxes by $5.1 billion, plus interest, and $2 billion in penalties for the years 2013 to 2015. </p><p>   The new bill comes on top of the $3.6 billion in back taxes plus interest that the biotechnology company disclosed last August that the IRS was seeking for the years 2010 to 2012. Amgen filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court last year to dispute those charges, and said on Wednesday that it would file another petition to dispute the new charges. </p><p>   Amgen said it would seek to consolidate the two cases in Tax Court, and expects it to take several years to resolve. </p><p>   The IRS adjustments to its tax bill are without merit, Amgen said. </p><p>   The company disclosed the new IRS charges in its first-quarter financial report. It had $6.24 billion in global sales in the first quarter, and $1.48 billion in net income. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast $6.07 billion in sales and $1.67 billion in net income. </p><p>   Amgen shares fell 4.3% in after-hours trading. </p><p>   The Thousand Oaks, Calif., company had $25.97 billion in global sales last year. The IRS claims relate to the way Amgen allocates profits between Puerto Rico, where it has significant manufacturing operations, and the U.S. mainland, where it is based. </p><p></p>",
