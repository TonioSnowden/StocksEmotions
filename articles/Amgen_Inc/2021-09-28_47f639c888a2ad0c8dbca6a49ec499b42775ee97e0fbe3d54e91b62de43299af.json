  "title": "Hidden Interests Federal Judges With Financial Conflicts; The Wall Street Journal analyzed a nearly a decade's worth of legal and financial records and discovered 131 federal judges who unlawfully heard cases where they had a financial interest.",
  "text": "<p>Judges offered a range of explanations for their errors. Several blamed court clerks. Others blamed misspellings on forms. Some said they took only minimal action in the cases, such as confirming settlements—but the law doesn't make exceptions for having played only a minor role.</p><p>The graphic below details the Journal's findings, including which federal judges violated the law, how many times they improperly heard cases, and what they have to say about it:</p><p>Comments from judges:</p><p>Lance Africk: Judge Africk directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stocks neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>W. Harold Albritton III: Judge Albritton said both cases went to mediation and settled without his involvement. But he said he would have recused had he known he held stock in the parties. \"I don't know what happened,\" he said. \"Evidently, these two must have fallen through the cracks.\"</p><p>Sandra Ammann: Judge Ammann said she didn't know that IBM was one of the defendants in the case. She said that the conflict slipped by the clerk's office and that her courtroom deputy should have double-checked the defendants in the case against the judge's recusal list.</p><p>Richard Arcara: Judge Arcara didn't respond to requests for comment sent to his chambers.</p><p>Sharion Aycock: Judge Aycock directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Lewis Babcock: \"The two cases that I did not recuse myself when I should have—I missed it,\" Judge Babcock said.</p><p>William Barbour Jr.: Judge Barbour died earlier this year. The court clerk sent notices of the conflicts to the parties in Judge Barbour's cases. The letters, which were publicly filed, said that \"as best we can tell, [Judge Barbour's] ownership of stock in Wal-Mart neither affected nor impacted his decisions.\"</p><p>Michael Barrett: Judge Barrett directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Timothy Batten Sr.: \"I am mortified,\" Judge Batten said when notified about his violations, which occurred in 2010 and 2011. \"I had no idea that I had an interest in any of these companies in what was a most modest retirement account\" managed by a broker, he said.</p><p>Roger Benitez: Judge Benitez said the cases were too old for him to recall specific details. In one case, he granted an unopposed motion to dismiss \"so there was no controversy to resolve,\" he said. In the other case, the plaintiff's handwritten complaint named more than a dozen entities and was dismissed by Judge Benitez as frivolous.</p><p>Helen Berrigan: Judge Berrigan, who is retired, couldn't be reached for comment. The Journal contacted the chambers of Chief Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Her chambers forwarded the Journal's findings to the court clerk.</p><p>Catherine Blake: Judge Blake said she had no specific recollection of the case, which spent less than a month on her docket before transferring to another district. \"I agree that, based on your summary of my financial disclosure report, I would have been disqualified from making any decisions in this case,\" she said.</p><p>Claria Horn Boom: Judge Boom directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in her case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Karon Bowdre: Judge Bowdre directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected her decisions.</p><p>Charles Breyer : Judge Breyer said the clerk's office at the time didn't have a process that would identify a conflict for a judge who inherited an ongoing case from another judge. \"I have reviewed the filings which confirms that I was not notified of the conflict at or prior to the time I dismissed the case,\" Judge Breyer said. \"Had I become aware of the conflict I would have, of course, recused myself as I did in three subsequent cases involving Bancorp.\"</p><p>A. Richard Caputo: Judge Caputo died in 2020. Chief Judge John Jones III of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where Judge Caputo served, said Judge Caputo shouldn't have been assigned the case.</p><p>Cormac Carney: Judge Carney learned of the conflicts before the Journal contacted him and had already alerted the parties. \"The Central District now utilizes a conflict's check program that significantly minimizes the risk of a judge ruling in a case that he or she was unaware he or she had a small financial interest in a party,\" Judge Carney said in an email. \"Hopefully, this prevents these oversights from happening in the future.\"</p><p>Robin Cauthron: \"We did then and do now have systems in place to screen cases for conflicts,\" Judge Cauthron said in an email. \"I have no memory of the case or the circumstances which allowed me to proceed with it but I assure you I would not have had I been aware of the conflict.\"</p><p>Dennis Cavanaugh: Judge Cavanaugh, who is retired, said he was unaware that he held any individual stock. \"The most I can think of is maybe someone gave a small amount as a gift to my kid. Whatever we owned was de minimis, and we didn't own it long,\" he said. \"I just really don't know. I was just never involved in stocks.\"</p><p>Claire Cecchi: Judge Cecchi notified the parties of the conflicts with publicly filed letters on the dockets in her cases. The letters said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Deborah Chasanow: \"Judge Chasanow has no comment other than to state that this was a ministerial entry of judgment at the direction of [a federal appellate court],\" said David Ciambruschini, chief deputy clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.</p><p>Theodore Chuang: Judge Chuang directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Robert Cleland: Judge Cleland directed the court administrator to notify the parties of the conflicts.

I assume that whenever a case [was] called for recusal, I recused myself,\" Judge Cohn said in a statement provided by his former court.</p><p>Sharon Johnson Coleman: Judge Coleman directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>William Conley: Judge Conley directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Christopher Conner: \"I should have recused. It was an error not to do so,\" Judge Conner said.</p><p>Julian Cook: Judge Cook died in 2017. Chief Judge Denise Page Hood of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, where Judge Cook served, said he was \"an outstanding member of our bench\" and that his record would reflect \"attention and adherence to the rules of ethics and conduct.\" She said she didn't know what his financial disclosure forms reflect.</p><p>Marcia Cooke: Judge Cooke directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Christopher Cooper: Judge Cooper declined to comment.</p><p>Paul Crotty: Judge Crotty directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Roy Dalton Jr.: Judge Dalton said that he had no specific recollection of the case but that he suspected he hadn't had an opportunity to screen for conflicts before the parties settled.</p><p>John deGravelles: Judge deGravelles directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Susan Dlott: Judge Dlott directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>David Dowd Jr.: Judge Dowd died in 2016. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, where he served before his death, forwarded the Journal's request for comment to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which declined to comment on specific judges.</p><p>Gershwin Drain: Judge Drain directed the court administrator to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Dee Drell: Judge Drell said that Target wasn't on his automatic recusal list and that he didn't know about the stock trades until after the fact. \"In all honesty, if there was a conflict with Target, I had not reviewed it by that point,\" he said.</p><p>Beth Labson Freeman : Judge Freeman directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected her decisions.</p><p>Gregory Frost: Judge Frost, who is retired, said it was his standard practice to inform the parties of any potential conflict \"and, if requested, I would recuse myself from the case.\" The federal law on judicial disqualification prohibits parties from waiving a judge's conflict if it stems from a financial interest in one of the parties.</p><p>Mark Fuller: Judge Fuller, who resigned in 2019, could not be reached for comment. The Journal requested comment from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which declined to comment on specific judges.</p><p>Orlando Garcia: Judge Garcia directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the docket in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>James Gardner : Judge Gardner died in 2017. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where Judge Gardner served, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>John Gerrard: Judge Gerrard has never directed any of the investments in his or his wife's IRA accounts, his law clerk said in an email. \"Judge Gerrard was not aware of any purchase of Wal-Mart stock in 2014, and only became aware in May 2015 when preparing his financial disclosure form for the 2014 calendar year, at which time the stock was sold,\" the clerk said.</p><p>Robert Gettleman: Judge Gettleman directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases. \"I want you to know that I take my ethical obligations quite seriously and that we have always had a system in my chambers to make sure that there are no conflicts with any of the cases assigned to me,\" Judge Gettleman said in a response forwarded via email by his courtroom deputy. \"That being said, no system is perfect and of course some things can slip through the cracks over a 27-year career as a district judge.\"</p><p>Julia Smith Gibbons:Judge Gibbons initially said she had mistakenly believed a holding in her husband's retirement account didn't require her recusal. She later directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected her decisions. \"I regret my misunderstanding, but I assure you it was an honest one,\" Judge Gibbons said.</p><p>Haywood Gilliam Jr.: Judge Gilliam directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case dockets, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Rodney Gilstrap: Judge Gilstrap said he failed to disqualify himself in several cases because they required little or no action on his part. A federal judges' advisory panel informed him this month that ethics rules don't allow for such exceptions. In the other cases found by the Journal, Judge Gilstrap said the investments were in a trust created for his wife that he didn't believe to be covered by the recusal law. Legal-ethics experts who reviewed the Journal's findings and Judge Gilstrap's description of the trust said he had a duty to recuse himself.</p><p>I. Leo Glasser: \"As near as I can tell, my recusal list must have been taken from my financial disclosure report. Keeping that list current is the responsibility of the judge,\" Judge Glasser said in an email. \"If, in my case, e.g., Merck was not added to the list by me when it was purchased in 2017, the potential conflict resulting from the purchase of that stock in 2018 would not have been flagged. How and by whom the flagging is done I don't know.\"</p><p>Mitchell Goldberg: \"Because the 5 cases you reference are very old, we have been unable to fully reconstruct why the two companies you reference may not have been spotted for conflicts,\" Judge Goldberg said in a statement emailed by his chambers. \"But based only upon the information you supplied, it appears that in any event, I did not make any substantive rulings in any of the cases.\"</p><p>Andrew Gordon: Judge Gordon directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Donald Graham: Judge Graham directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was sent to the parties and provided to the Journal by the clerk, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Gina Groh: Judge Groh directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>James Gwin: \"We have tried to use a system for recognizing conflicts, but the Clerk's office and I did not catch it when this case was reassigned to me,\" Judge Gwin said. \"The Citibank investment was minimal, worth approximately $1,000 when I received the Citibank case.\" Judge Gwin said he sold the stock and other holdings in 2011 to simplify his conflict-checking.</p><p>Jean Hamilton: Judge Hamilton directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in her case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>M. Douglas Harpool: Judge Harpool said he took a loss on the sale of his stock after realizing he had mistakenly acquired a financial interest in a party before him. \"I managed to lose money net on the trades which would conclusively demonstrate I had no financial incentives related to the case,\" he said.</p><p>Larry Hicks: Judge Hicks said that he shouldn't have been assigned the Walmart cases because they were on his recusal list. \"That was a mistake,\" he said.</p><p>S. Maurice Hicks, Jr.: Judge Hicks declined to comment.</p><p>Claude Hilton: Judge Hilton didn't respond to requests for comment sent to his chambers.</p><p>Robert Hinkle: Judge Hinkle directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>William Hoeveler: Judge Hoeveler died in 2017. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, where Judge Hoeveler served, didn't respond to the Journal's requests for comment.</p><p>Michael Hogan: Judge Hogan, who is retired, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>J. Leon Holmes: Judge Holmes, who is retired, couldn't be reached for comment. The Journal requested comment from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which declined to comment on specific judges.</p><p>Denise Page Hood: Judge Hood said the Ford stock belonged to her adult children but that she may still have been the custodian of her children's accounts. \"I did and still have a system in place to target for recusal cases which present a conflict to me. For some reason that I do not recall, this case was not targeted,\" Judge Hood said.</p><p>Anthony Ishii: Judge Ishii directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case dockets, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Brian Jackson: Judge Jackson directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>R. Brooke Jackson: Judge Jackson said that his wife primarily handles the family's finances and that neither husband nor wife was aware that the judge needed to create conflicts lists at the court so that he would get a notice if he drew a case involving a party in which one of their accounts had an investment. \"We both thought, she understandably, that by fully disclosing everything in the annual reports we had done what we were supposed to do,\" Judge Jackson said. \"Obviously, I was mistaken not to have recused on many, if not all, of these cases. I have acknowledged my error, and I have taken steps to make sure it will not happen in the future.\"</p><p>Rebecca Grady Jennings: Judge Jennings directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>John Jones III: Judge Jones, who recently stepped down, said he couldn't recall the details of the stock purchase. He said that his broker may have told him about it but that he may have neglected to send the information to his judicial assistant, who typically screened Judge Jones's cases for conflicts. \"It didn't affect my decision in any way. I'm not even sure I knew I had [the stock],\" he said.</p><p>Leon Jordan: Judge Jordan's chambers said in a statement that his role in the case was \"ministerial rather than substantive\" and that the parties requested a stay in the case before Judge Jordan or his staff had noted the conflict.</p><p>Gladys Kessler: Judge Kessler, who is retired, couldn't be reached for comment. The Journal requested comment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The court didn't respond to a request for comment. The Administrative Office declined to comment on specific judges.</p><p>Garr King: Judge King died in 2019. Chief Judge Marco A. Hernández of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, where Judge King served, declined to comment.</p><p>George King: Judge King, who is retired, declined to comment.</p><p>R. Gary Klausner: Judge Klausner said he delegated conflict-screening to his staff. He said one of the cases was dismissed \"before I ever saw it.\" Judges often don't see a case until the first motion is filed, he said.</p><p>Charles Kocoras: Judge Kocoras's judicial assistant said he delegated the buying and selling of stocks to his broker and didn't believe he held a significant interest in either of the companies.</p><p>John Kronstadt: Judge Kronstadt directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>William Kuntz II: Judge Kuntz said he checks his conflicts after being randomly assigned cases. Judge Kuntz said in West v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. he made no substantive orders before the case was assigned to multi-district litigation and has since been reassigned. In Mack v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP Judge Kuntz said he entered the purely ministerial order to dismiss the case after the parties requested dismissal. In Abraham V. American Home Mortgage Service, Judge Kuntz said the conflict software didn't identify an affiliate as a conflict.</p><p>Ronald Leighton: Judge Leighton, who is retired from the bench and in private practice, didn't respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>Mary Geiger Lewis: Judge Lewis directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Thomas Ludington: Judge Ludington said he didn't disqualify himself from the case because he was never called on to make an \"adjudicatory decision\" and the parties settled.</p><p>John Lungstrum: \"I'm embarrassed,\" Judge Lungstrum said. He said his brokerage purchased common stock contrary to his orders to only invest in funds and bonds, which don't require recusal.</p><p>Sandra Lynch: Judge Lynch directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said Judge Lynch was unaware her husband's IRA held Pfizer stock. \"Because the judge was unaware of this addition to her husband's portfolio, Pfizer had yet to be added to her conflicts list,\" the letter said. \"Had Judge Lynch known of the broker's purchase of the stock, she would not have participated in the case.\"</p><p>Emily Marks: Judge Marks directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Brian Martinotti: Judge Martinotti directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Henry Morgan Jr.: Judge Morgan said he was unaware his wife owned the stock in a separate account. \"Had I known she owned it, I would have certainly done something about it,\" he said.</p><p>Margaret Morrow: \"Before I took substantive action in a case, we always reviewed whether any potential conflicts existed,\" said Judge Morrow, who is retired, in an email. \"Both of the cases you reference never proceeded to substantive action involving judicial rulings or hearings. In both cases, I was the assigned judge for a very short time and took no substantive action. Had the cases progressed, a conflicts check would have led to my recusal.\"</p><p>J. Frederick Motz: Judge Motz, who is retired, couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Stephen Murphy III: \"Though I had what I thought were two good screening systems in place at the time, the three cases obviously fell through the cracks, possibly because I was changing financial advisors,\" Judge Murphy said. Judge Murphy notified all parties in the cases of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Janet Neff: Judge Neff declined to comment.</p><p>William Nickerson: Judge Nickerson, who is retired, couldn't be reached for comment. The Journal requested comment from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which declined to comment on specific judges.</p><p>John Nordberg: Judge Nordberg died earlier this year. The clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, where Judge Nordberg served, notified the parties of the conflict. The letter was publicly filed on the docket.</p><p>Charles Norgle Sr.: Judge Norgle didn't respond to requests for comment sent to his chambers.</p><p>David Norton: Judge Norton said he inadvertently violated the federal judicial disqualification law by presiding in two cases involving Walmart Inc. and one involving Boeing, but he disputed that his stock holdings in General Electric Co. and 3M Co. required him to recuse from six asbestos lawsuits, saying the companies were \"defendants in name only.\" \"At the outset the lawyers involved in these cases assured me that 3M and GE would be dismissed and not involved in the case pursuant to a preexisting agreement between the plaintiffs' lawyers and GE and 3M,\" Judge Norton said in a letter emailed to the Journal by his chambers. A lawyer for the plaintiffs in one of the cases, however, disputed Judge Norton's account. \"While we did have a history of resolving cases with GE and 3M, we had no preexisting settlement,\" said attorney Peter Kraus. \"GE and 3M were sued because the evidence in the case implicated them, and were certainly not 'defendants in name only.'\" A 3M spokeswoman said neither the company nor its attorneys ever assured the judge regarding any dismissals. A spokeswoman for GE didn't respond to questions about whether it had conveyed such an assurance.</p><p>William Orrick : Judge Orrick directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither impacted nor affected his decisions.</p><p>Sul Ozerden: Judge Ozerden directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Robert Payne: Judge Payne directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case dockets, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Robert Pratt: Judge Pratt directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Dean Pregerson: Judge Pregerson said the stocks were held in college tuition accounts for his sons and that he had no role in managing them. \"It appears that ten to twelve years ago, through either an oversight or a mis-communication between my accountant, my assistant, and myself, two of my sons' holdings that were listed on my publicly-available disclosure form were not added to my conflict list,\" Judge Pregerson said in a statement provided by his law clerk. \"I have taken steps to ensure that similar breakdowns do not occur in the future.\"</p><p>Edgardo Ramos : Judge Ramos directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter was publicly filed on the docket. Judge Ramos's recusal list included Exxon Mobil Corp., but the court's screening software relies on exact name matches for companies and failed to flag the conflict because the party in the case was ExxonMobil Oil Corp., a subsidiary of Exxon, said Edward Friedland, the district executive for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Nelva Gonzales Ramos: Judge Ramos directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the dockets in her case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Walter Rice: After being contacted by the Journal, Judge Rice informed attorneys in Garrett Day LLC v. International Paper of his financial holdings in International Paper Company. \"I think the fact that three cases got by me indicate that the system isn't working perfectly,\" Judge Rice said. \"I think the system should work perfectly. It's a question of not only avoiding conflicts apparent or real but it's about maintaining respect for the judiciary.\"</p><p>Robin Rosenberg: Judge Rosenberg directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>John Ross: Judge Ross inherited the stock after his mother died, according to an email from the judge's chambers. \"While it was never his intent to retain any interest in an individual stock, he had these interests,\" the email said. Judge Ross asked the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Allyne Ross: Judge Ross said her chambers maintains a list of her stocks and updates it as her investment adviser adds a new position or eliminates one. \"From the information you supplied it would appear that, in the five cases you describe, I failed to notice that I owned stock in a company involved in the litigation,\" Judge Ross said in an email. \"Obviously if I had been aware of this fact I would have declined to preside over the case. The fact that I failed to do so is regrettable and wholly inadvertent.\"</p><p>Thomas Russell: Judge Russell directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in his cases, said that \"the stock was purchased in the context of Judge Russell's participation in an investment club partnership and, unbeknownst to Judge Russell, was inadvertently not included in the Clerk's Office's conflict screening software.\"</p><p>Janis Sammartino: Judge Sammartino directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Benjamin Settle: \"In reviewing my conflicts list in 2007, not all of my stock holdings were on the list. Amgen was among those mistakenly omitted,\" Judge Settle said. He divested himself of all stocks in 2008 and 2009, he said.</p><p>Charles Siragusa: Judge Siragusa said his investments are managed by Morgan Stanley without his involvement. \"That's not to say I shouldn't have picked up on some of these, but we have a conflict-checking system that is supposed to alert me if there's a conflict,\" he said.</p><p>Christina Snyder: Judge Snyder directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected her decisions.</p><p>Sam Sparks: Judge Sparks didn't respond to requests for comment sent to his chambers.</p><p>Arthur Spatt: Judge Spatt died in 2020. Chief Judge Margo Brodie of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, where Judge Spatt served, said he was revered by lawyers for his integrity and evenhandedness but said that he should have recused.</p><p>Dominic Squatrito: Judge Squatrito died in January 2021. Chief Judge Stefan Underhill said that Judge Squatrito's activity in Castellone v. Target Stores Inc was very limited but that technically he should have recused. In Bittinger v. Wells Fargo N.A., Judge Underhill said, \"I agree he should not have heard that case under the judicial code.\"</p><p>John Steele: Judge Steele didn't respond to requests for comment sent to his chambers.</p><p>William Stiehl: Judge Stiehl died in 2016. Chief Judge Nancy Rosenstengel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, where Judge Stiehl served, said that the case \"was tantamount to a ministerial matter\" because it transferred from his court to another district, where it was combined with similar lawsuits. \"Cases are always randomly assigned to judges upon filing, and it is up to each judge to conduct a conflict screening on new cases,\" Judge Rosenstengel said in an email.</p><p>Greg Stivers: Judge Stivers declined to comment.</p><p>Glenn Suddaby: Judge Suddaby directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the case docket, said the stock neither impacted nor affected the cases.</p><p>James Sweeney II: Judge Sweeney directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflict. The letter, which was publicly filed on the docket in his case, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Anne Thompson: Judge Thompson directed the clerk of the court to notify the parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets in her cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>N. Carlton Tilley Jr.: Judge Tilley referred the Journal's questions to John Brubaker, the clerk for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. \"It appears that Walmart was listed on his conflict list and my office inadvertently assigned the case to him,\" Mr. Brubaker said in an email.</p><p>Aleta Trauger: \"I have been very sensitive to potential conflicts of interest and regret that you have found one on my record,\" Judge Trauger said in an email. \"My husband and I inherited Wal-Mart stock upon the death of a family member, but I was slow in notifying our Clerk's Office to add Wal-Mart to my recusal list.\"</p><p>Marc Treadwell: Judge Treadwell directed the court clerk to notify parties of the conflicts. The letters, which were publicly filed on the docket in his cases, said the stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.</p><p>Petrese Tucker: Judge Tucker recused from two ongoing cases after the Journal alerted her to conflicts in those cases. She also directed the court clerk to notify parties of conflicts in two closed cases in which she made substantive rulings. The letters, which were publicly filed on the dockets, said the stock neither affected nor impacted her decisions.</p><p>Roger Vinson: \"I didn't realize I had Merck that early. It was probably something where I didn't update my [recusal] lists.\" Judge Vinson said.</p><p>Donald Walter: Judge Walter directed the court clerk to notify the parties of the conflicts.
