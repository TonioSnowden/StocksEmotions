  "title": "Only 47 stocks in the S&P 500 have fallen over the past year — Wall Street predicts they will climb up to 54% in 12 months",
  "text": "<p>Over the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has climbed a remarkable 34.7%, excluding dividends. And during that period, only 47 of its components have dropped in price.</p><p>All 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 have risen in this one-year period through Sept. 27, led by the energy sector, up 74.5%, and financials, up 64.9%. The worst-performing sector has been utilities, up “only” 9.6%.</p><p>So who are the losers? One example is Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, the developer of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft videogame franchises. The company agreed on Sept. 27 to pay $18 million as part of a settlement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's investigation of sexual harassment claims by Activision Blizzard employees. The stock is down 7% over the past year, but analysts believe it will rise 54% over the next 12 months.</p><p>Here's a list of all 47 stocks among the S&amp;P 500 that were down for one year through Sept. 27. The list is sorted by the percentage of “buy” or equivalent ratings among Wall Street analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Among them, 20 are rated “buys” by a majority of analysts. The consensus price targets imply double-digit upside for all 20:</p><p> Company                                          Price decline – one year through Sept. 27  Share “buy” ratings  Closing price – Sept. 27  Consensus price target  Implied 12-month upside potential  Activision Blizzard Inc.
