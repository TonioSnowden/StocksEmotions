  "title": "Obituaries: Deals Banker Found Promise in Biotech Firms",
  "text": "<p>In 1983, Amgen Inc., then a startup in the fledgling biotechnology industry, was running out of money after raising millions from venture-capital firms. Fred Frank, a partner at Lehman Brothers, suggested the company stage an initial public offering, sensing it had promise. Amgen executives laughed at the idea, given that the firm had no products.</p><p>The IPO, though shaky, raised nearly $40 million and Amgen went on to become a force in the industry with a stable of blockbuster drugs and a market value above $120 billion. While it pained Mr. Frank that skeptics at Lehman prevented his firm from playing a role in the deal, the offering -- and later transactions that Mr. Frank engineered, including Genentech Inc.'s 1990 deal with Roche Holding AG -- provided blueprints for fostering young biotechs and linking them up with established players that are ubiquitous in the healthcare industry today.</p><p>Mr. Frank, a soft-spoken pharmaceuticals analyst who went on to be a star investment banker with a knack for spotting promising new science decades before the pack, died Sept. 11 at the age of 89 in Manhattan. His wife and longtime colleague, Mary Tanner, said he had been recovering from open-heart surgery when he fell ill and died in the hospital with family by his side.</p><p>Mr. Frank, who rose at 4 a.m., exercised twice a day and didn't drink, Ms. Tanner said. After meeting at Lehman and shepherding deals such as the union of Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp., the couple founded a small investment bank in 2014 focused on nurturing biotech startups. Mr. Frank had recently been counseling a company testing a Covid-19 treatment.</p><p>A lifelong fascination with finding the most novel technology and science -- and its ability to make stocks more valuable -- kept Mr. Frank engaged over his more than 60-year career.</p><p>Frederick Frank was born May 31, 1932, to a family that was part of a small Jewish community in heavily Mormon Salt Lake City. His father, Simon, ran a department store started by Mr. Frank's grandfather, and his mother was a homemaker who held elegant salon concerts in their home.</p><p>Mr. Frank's trajectory shifted when he read about East Coast prep schools in Fortune magazine, according to \"A Philosopher on Wall Street: How Creative Financier Fred Frank Forged the Future,\" a commissioned biography of Mr. Frank by David Ewing Duncan. He attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and went on to Yale University, studying philosophy. He then served in the U.S. Army in France, where he met his first wife.</p><p>He often seemed to show up as things were on the cusp of change. He attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business as early signs of the technology boom that created Silicon Valley were emerging blocks away. After graduating, he resisted pressure from his father to join him in the family business and headed to Wall Street.</p><p>As a young analyst at Smith Barney &amp; Co., Mr. Frank saw promise in sleepy pharmaceutical companies, which at that point paid little notice to nascent biotech firms. He became Wall Street's first analyst dedicated to the pharmaceuticals sector after urging the firm to separate it from chemicals.</p><p>After joining Lehman in 1969, he switched to investment banking, reasoning it allowed him to keep tabs on new companies even earlier. \"In investment banking, watchful waiting is often the key to transformational transactions,\" he wrote in a foreword to his biography.</p><p>Such was the case when he helped take the then-unprofitable biotech pioneer Cetus Corp. public in 1981 and a growing investor appetite for science made it one of the largest IPOs ever at the time.</p><p>Mr. Frank met Ms. Tanner in 1979 when she was an associate at Lehman assigned to his team. While both worked constantly, the two spent downtime on business trips in Europe finding French antiques. Among the finds displayed in their Upper East Side townhouse is a sitting-room set Napoleon gifted to his second wife and son.</p><p>In addition to Ms. Tanner, Mr. Frank's survivors include their son, two daughters from his previous marriage and two grandchildren.</p><p>By the time Mr. Frank had reached retirement age, he was energized to see the deal frenzy he had long anticipated unfolding. He told the New York Times in 1993 that the activity surpassed anything he had seen in his 35 years of banking. \"I came into this industry vertically, and I'll go out horizontally,\" he said.</p>",
