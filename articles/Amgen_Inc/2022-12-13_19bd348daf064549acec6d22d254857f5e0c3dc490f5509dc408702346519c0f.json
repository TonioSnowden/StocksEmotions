  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Amgen's First Test: Fix  Horizon's Growth Issue  ----  By David Wainer",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The crown jewel in Amgen's $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is the drug Tepezza for thyroid eye disease, a rare condition that causes swelling and damage to the tissues around the eye. </p><p>\n  It is the only drug approved in the U.S. for the condition and is generating close to $2 billion in annualized sales. Horizon in November upped its guidance for the treatment, predicting expansion abroad and growth in the U.S. will help the drug fetch more than $4 billion in peak sales. The guidance was seen by many on Wall Street as a sign Horizon was gearing up for a sale. An immediate challenge: The drug's sales plateaued in recent quarters, raising the question of whether Horizon's numbers are realistic. </p><p>\n  Since reaching a high of $616 million in revenue for the third-quarter of 2021, Tepezza sales dropped sequentially for three straight periods before rebounding modestly in the third quarter to $491 million. The company attributed the relatively high base-effect to a Covid-19-related supply disruption, but that doesn't fully assuage concerns that sales stagnated. </p><p>\n  One factor that could be holding sales back is that Horizon is essentially building up a new treatment approach from scratch in a complicated medical landscape. That is the sort of thing with which a larger biopharma company like Amgen can theoretically help. In order for a patient to access Tepezza, they are first likely to see an endocrinologist who would make a referral to an ophthalmologist. In the rare event that the disease progresses, the eye doctor might refer the patient to an ocular surgeon, who until recently relied on surgical procedures to treat such patients. </p><p>\n  Following Tepezza's approval in 2020, an initial wave of ocular surgeons in large academic centers and hospitals started to adopt the treatment. Yet many surgeons, especially those outside larger institutions, have yet to embrace the treatment, says Ken Cacciatore, an analyst at Cowen. </p><p>\n  One reason is there are logistical challenges, highlighted by \"a burdensome managed care process that requires a committed clinical staff, which has to coordinate the patients' IV infusions,\" he says. Another has to do with incentives. While Tepezza is good for patients in that it helps them avoid surgery, it does mean the loss of a hefty surgery fee. That sort of financial loss might be easily absorbed by hospitals, but it isn't as easy of a change for independent ocular surgeons, Mr. Cacciatore notes. </p><p>\n  To grow Tepezza sales, Horizon's potential new owner, Amgen, will need to do two things. It will have to target the ocular surgeons sitting on the fence while building relationships with referring doctors to make sure they are sending patients to clinics that adopted Tepezza. The company will need to focus on expanding the drug beyond the U.S. to reach patients globally, where prices will be significantly lower. </p><p>\n  Amgen's global operations chief Murdo Gordon alluded to that during a call on the acquisition Monday morning, acknowledging there will be a price difference between the U.S. and the rest of the world. But he argued that products like Tepezza still are highly profitable with a very high \"unmet need in the market.\" </p><p>\n  Horizon was highly successful in ramping up Tepezza's initial adoption before growth began to stall this year. How significantly Amgen can build upon Horizon's success will be key in determining the success of the year's largest healthcare deal. </p><p></p>",
