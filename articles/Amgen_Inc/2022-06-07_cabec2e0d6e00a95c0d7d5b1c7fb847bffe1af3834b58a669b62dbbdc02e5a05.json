  "text": "<p>Typically, drugmakers deploy a virus, such as adeno-associated virus, to deliver a gene or other genetic medicine into patients. Viral vectors are used in successful gene therapies such as Zolgensma, a Novartis AG treatment for children with the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy.</p><p>Viral vectors have limitations that hinder the genetic-medicine sector, according to Brian McVeigh, Code's co-founder and chief executive. Current systemic gene therapies don't have a targeting mechanism that enables them to home in on specific tissue. As a result, large doses may be needed to ensure some of the treatment reaches the target cells, he said.</p><p>In addition, viral-based therapies can only be given once. This is because the immune system mounts a response to the virus and would degrade it if the same virus-based treatment were given again, he said.</p><p>Code formed in 2020 and is using technology acquired from biotech company Genisphere LLC and intellectual property from collaborators at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. McVeigh said. Code makes the scaffold from strands of synthetic DNA and doesn't trigger an immune response, opening the possibility of developing genetic medicines that can be given more than once, according to Mr. McVeigh.</p><p>Code's delivery technology also uses a molecule that binds to receptors on the surface of specific cells the company is targeting. Because the construct zeroes in on the cells of interest, the company may be able to use relatively low doses, he said.</p><p>Code, which in February said it is collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. to design and develop gene therapies for rare diseases, has two other pharmaceutical collaborations but hasn't publicly revealed details about them, Mr. McVeigh said.</p><p>With this financing, Code plans to move therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease, and Type 1 diabetes, which renders patients dependent on insulin therapy, toward clinical trials. Duchenne, a type of muscular dystrophy that worsens quickly, stems from a defective gene for the muscle protein dystrophin. Code's prospective treatments include one that would deliver the full-length dystrophin gene into patients, Mr. McVeigh said.</p><p>\"We have the potential to be a significant help for these patients if our approach works,\" he said.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes occurs as the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leaving patients reliant on insulin injections. Code's potential T1D therapies include a genetic medicine that reprograms alpha cells in the pancreas to add insulin production to their list of duties, he said, noting that the immune system doesn't appear to attack these cells in T1D patients.</p><p>Code, which disclosed a $10 million seed funding in April 2021, said it raised this Series A financing from Northpond Ventures, which led the round, as well as Amgen Ventures, Hatteras Venture Partners, UCB Ventures and existing investors New Enterprise Associates, 4BIO Capital, CureDuchenne Ventures, JDRF T1D Fund, UPMC Enterprises and Takeda Ventures.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p><p>Genetic-Medicines Startup Code Biotherapeutics Gathers $75 Million</p>",
