  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Starting next year the highest-grossing drug of all time, AbbVie's Humira, will face competition from copycat biologics in the U.S. Yet the makers of the complex generics known as biosimilars won't necessarily be the biggest winners. The top beneficiaries could instead be middlemen such as Cigna and CVS Health, which will negotiate and dispense the drugs to patients. </p><p>\n  Humira -- used to treat diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to gut disorders -- has raked in about $200 billion over its lifetime and is on pace to bring in more than $21 billion this year alone, according to data from Visible Alpha. While biosimilars have been available in Europe since 2018, patents have shielded Humira from competition in the U.S. until 2023, when companies including Amgen and Teva Pharmaceutical will begin rolling out versions. </p><p>\n  While manufacturing biosimilars will be a big opportunity for other drug companies, the Food and Drug Administration has approved seven versions, meaning there will be pressure on margins as companies compete. AbbVie itself will continue making money from Humira for several years, with annual revenue for the drug exceeding $4 billion until 2026, according to data from FactSet. </p><p>\n  Competition between biosimilar makers will benefit the U.S. consumer and taxpayer. Specialty-drug costs, including Humira, represent 2% of prescriptions, yet account for 50% of drug spending, according to UnitedHealth Group's Optum Rx. </p><p>\n  But the savings will also benefit pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, such as Optum Rx, Cigna's Evernorth/Express Scripts and CVS's Caremark, which negotiate those discounts and then provide the medication to patients through specialty pharmacies. </p><p>\n  The key is how the drugs are administered. Biologics are usually taken via injection or infusion. So far, most of the 24 biosimilars approved in the U.S. are administered under the supervision of a medical professional in a clinical setting. But an analysis by Morgan Stanley suggests more than 70% of total branded sales going off patent through 2025 will be covered by pharmacy-benefit managers and dispensed directly by their specialty pharmacies to patients. </p><p>\n  For-profit pharmacy-benefit managers in the U.S. are responsible for negotiating with drug companies and deciding which ones to place in their formulary. Drug companies can win over PBMs by offering rebates, or discounts from the list price. </p><p>\n  United's Optum Rx became the first PBM to disclose how it plans to transition to Humira biosimilars. Heather Cianfrocco, chief executive of Optum Rx, said in November that AbbVie's drug would be offered alongside as many as three other medications next year. Optum Rx's decision is expected to generate double-digit-percentage savings on the drug for clients next year, the company said. What went unsaid is that it will be a boon for the companies administering it, too. </p><p></p>",
