  "title": "Rep. Scott Peters Draws Fire From Fellow Democrats in Drug-Pricing Fight; California Democrat says his goal is to lower drug prices and defend thousands of pharmaceutical jobs in his San Diego district",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Peters's vote that day, along with two other Democrats on the Energy and Commerce panel, briefly stalled the measure designed to enable Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, which advanced hours later in another committee.</p><p>But the vote immediately positioned Mr. Peters in the crosshairs of an array of lawmakers and activist groups pushing to include broad Medicare negotiations as part of the roughly $3.5 trillion social policy and climate package Democrats are currently drafting.</p><p>The stakes of the debate are high, both because Democrats have pledged for years to lower the cost of drugsâ€”and also since doing so generates hundreds of billions in savings they plan to use to pay for expanding other healthcare programs. Failing to reach a consensus also derails the effort, since Democrats can afford no more than three defections in the House.</p><p>Mr. Peters and four other centrist Democrats have introduced their own legislation, which he said is aimed at making drugs more affordable while preserving a system that encourages private investments in the creation of new treatments. The pharmaceutical industry has launched a lobbying campaign against the provision currently in the House bill and praised the centrist Democrats for opposing it, while saying it \"falls short of the balanced approach\" best suited to lowering patients' drug prices.</p><p>\"All those companies employ thousands of people in my district,\" Mr. Peters said. \"So it's my job to make sure that that economy continues to thrive.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think will be the fallout from Sen. Peters's opposition to the Democrats' prescription drug plan? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Still, complaints have swamped his district office. Liberal groups have pushed to have him removed from his leadership position, launched radio ad campaigns in his district decrying his position, and friends and longtime supporters have asked Mr. Peters for an explanation.</p><p>\"People say they want their elected officials to be independent thinkers but sometimes when they actually see independent thinking, they don't greet it with enthusiasm,\" he said. After explaining his thinking, \"most of them have been 'OK, well that makes sense,' \" he said, while also expressing sympathy for the aides in his district office manning the complaints pouring in over the phones.</p><p>Republicans have opposed the Democrats' social-policy, climate and tax plans, including the drug-pricing provisions, which they have said would limit patients' access and reduce the number of new drugs coming onto the market.</p><p>Shortly before voting the provision down in committee, Mr. Peters and four other centrist Democrats unveiled their legislation. Under their plan, Medicare could negotiate for price concessions of 25% to 35% over a more limited group of drugs in Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and outpatient care. Their legislation would also cap Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and establish a $50 a month maximum on the cost of insulin.</p><p>The provision backed by House Democratic leaders goes much further, allowing Medicare to negotiate in Part D, its prescription drug benefit program, over a group of the most expensive and commonly used drugs that don't face competition, as well as insulin.</p><p>Those negotiated prices couldn't go above 120% of the drug's average price in a group of international countries. If companies refused to negotiate or didn't agree to the price, they would be subject to an excise tax of up to 95% of that drug's sales.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the broader version of the drug-pricing legislation would lower spending by about $456 billion over 10 years. Mr. Peters's bill is expected to generate about $200 billion in revenue over 10 years.</p><p>Drugmakers have given generously to Mr. Peters's recent re-election campaigns.</p><p>Employees and political-action committees in health and pharmaceuticals have been his top industry contributors since 2018, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and biopharmaceutical companies Amgen Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. are his leading campaign cash sources so far this election cycle, the center shows.</p><p>\"It's probably not surprising that I would be supported by the individuals who work at those companies. I think If I was in Michigan, people from General Motors and Ford might be supporting me,\" Mr. Peters said.</p><p>The San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation estimates that the life sciences industry employs about 27,000 people in the greater San Diego area.</p><p>Critics of Mr. Peters's approach said his plan is too narrow, by not allowing negotiations over a large enough array of drugs or having sufficient enforcement mechanisms to force companies to lower their prices.</p><p>\"You can't call a bill that excludes Part D a Medicare negotiation bill,\" said David Mitchell, president of Patients for Affordable Drugs, a group advocating for lower drug costs. Part D covers more than 3,500 prescription drug products, compared with around 600 in Part B.</p><p>Mr. Peters's position has put him at odds with many in his party, who point to wide public support for lower drug prices. The issue has created fissures even within the party's centrist wing. Many of the most vulnerable House Democrats up for re-election next year have campaigned on pledges to lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate.</p><p>Rep. Susan Wild (D., Pa.) led a letter signed by 14 other vulnerable Democrats in July urging their leaders to include it in the broad social policy and climate package. Ms. Wild said she would be working on the Democrats, including Mr. Peters, who voted against it in committee. \"I am not prepared for one second to accept that,\" she said.</p><p>More Perfect Union, a liberal group, sent a letter to Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the head of House Democrats' campaign arm, asking him to strip Mr. Peters from his leadership position as a regional vice chair.</p><p>\"It's not something we're actively considering,\" Mr. Maloney said. \"What we're focusing on is getting the legislation done.\"</p><p>Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com</p><p>Rep.
