  "title": "Obituaries: Rising Biotech Star Found a Second Act",
  "text": "<p>In 1989, when she was 34, Kathy Wiltsey appeared headed for one of the top jobs in the biotechnology industry.</p><p>That year The Wall Street Journal listed 28 rising stars from around the world, all 45 years old or younger, who \"could be among the business leaders of tomorrow.\" Ms. Wiltsey, then marketing director at Amgen Inc., made the list, along with Larry Fink, now chief executive of BlackRock Inc., and Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Instead of soaring into the CEO ranks, Ms. Wiltsey retired from Amgen nine years later, in 1998, the year she turned 43. Her stock options diminished her need to work, and she wanted to slow down, hang out with her daughters, then ages 5 and 2, and do volunteer work to promote scientific education for children. She hired a bush pilot in Alaska to take her and her daughters to the most remote parts of Denali National Park.</p><p>There was another reason for her decision to retire early: Because her mother died of cancer at age 59, Ms. Wiltsey thought her life might be short, too. Her husband, John LaValle, tried to dispel those forebodings.</p><p>Diagnosed more than a decade ago with frontotemporal dementia, Ms. Wiltsey died of complications from that disease on Feb. 2. She was 65.</p><p>\"She was on a shot clock in her head to get as much accomplished as possible; always working, churning away on projects and activities until her mind abandoned her,\" Mr. LaValle said.</p><p>Kathleen Margaret Wiltsey, the younger of two children, was born June 25, 1955, and grew up in Staten Island, N.Y. Her mother was a public high school art teacher, and her father taught chemistry in prep schools. The family had a summer home in Central City, Colo., where visits to an opera house gave her a taste for Mozart, Verdi and Gilbert and Sullivan.</p><p>Though she wanted to study architecture at Princeton University, her father insisted on sending her to the Colorado School of Mines. She majored in chemical engineering and graduated in 1977. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. hired her as a process engineer and assigned her to a task force looking into life sciences. That sparked her interest in biotechnology.</p><p>While earning an M.B.A. degree at Harvard Business School, she looked for biotech jobs and was snubbed by most of the companies she approached. After hearing good things about Amgen, she made a late-night phone call to what was then still a tiny company. Ms. Wiltsey intended to leave a message to be found the next morning. Instead, George B. Rathmann, Amgen's founding chief executive, picked up the phone. He invited her to visit the company in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She accepted a job there as a business development manager in 1984.</p><p>Promoted to marketing director, she oversaw the launch of Epogen, an anti-anemia drug created via genetic engineering and used by kidney-dialysis patients. In 1991, she was promoted to vice president, making her responsible for product licensing.</p><p>Her mentor, Mr. Rathmann, left the company in 1990, and the culture changed as Amgen grew. She eventually decided to chuck the corporate rat race and make more time for her young daughters and favorite causes, notably persuading young people that math and science could be fun.</p><p>Ms. Wiltsey, who lived with her family in Westlake Village, near Los Angeles, tried to find a home for a science-discovery center in Ventura County, Calif., as a way to stimulate children's interest in scientific careers. \"I want our kids to do better\" in science, she told the Los Angeles Times in 2001. \"These centers take the fear out of science.\"</p><p>She worked briefly for the XPrize Foundation, which organizes competitions among teams vying to achieve technological feats. At the California Institute of Technology, she was president of the board of Caltech Associates, a fundraising body. She was on the boards of Lexicon Genetics Inc., Sequenom Inc. and the Los Angeles Opera.</p><p>Survivors include her husband; two daughters, Alexandra and Whitney LaValle, and a brother.</p><p>As a girl, Alexandra LaValle drew a picture of two astronauts, one male and the other female. \"I remember being questioned by Mom about why the man's head was bigger than the woman's,\" Ms. LaValle said. \"I will never forget the lecture I got after I erroneously said it was because boys were smarter than girls.\"</p>",
