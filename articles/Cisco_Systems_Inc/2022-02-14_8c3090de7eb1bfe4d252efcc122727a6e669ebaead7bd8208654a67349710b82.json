  "text": "<p>European markets were hard hit by the threat of a possible ground war in Ukraine. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was recently down 1.9%, led lower by banks and travel and leisure companies.</p><p>The index pared losses after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested Moscow should continue talks with the U.S. and its allies.</p><p>Yields on government bonds were whipsawed by the fast-moving situation. After initially falling as investors reached for the safety of U.S. Treasurys, yields bounced back on Mr. Lavrov's comments. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was recently 2.007%, up from 1.951% Friday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>After weeks in which the brewing conflict appeared to have little impact on Wall Street, U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the White House warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine at any moment. Moscow has denied intending to invade Ukraine, but Russia's military buildup has quickened, with forces positioned on three sides of the country.</p><p>Oil prices held steady on Monday, after jumping on concern a war would curtail supplies of Russian crude amid a lack significant spare supplies. Futures on Brent, the benchmark in energy markets, slipped less than 0.1% to $94.47 a barrel, holding near its highest level since 2014.</p><p>Prices for natural gas, of which Russia is the single biggest exporter globally, rose on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., benchmark gas prices jumped 4.8% to $4.13 per million British thermal units. Prices in Europe, which depends on Russia for much of its gas—a chunk of it flowing through Ukraine—climbed 3.4%.</p><p>Russia's benchmark stock index, the Moex Russia, slid 1.7%. Ukraine's hryvnia weakened 1.4% to 28.55 a dollar.</p><p>Stocks have also been buffeted this year by the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. The central bank is gearing up to increase borrowing costs to combat the highest rate of inflation in four decades, winding down the easy-money policies that have pushed riskier assets higher for much of the past two years.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC on Monday that the Fed should \"front-load\" its planned rate increases to combat higher-than-explected inflation, warning that the central bank's credibility was on the line.</p><p>Investors say the standoff over Ukraine is difficult to trade. If Moscow were to attack and the U.S. and its allies responded with sanctions, the hostilities could affect the world economy and markets in unpredictable ways.</p><p>One likely consequence, given Russia's position as a commodities superpower, would be higher energy prices, which could keep up the pressure on central banks to raise rates. At least in the short term, stocks and bond yields would likely decline as investors sought safe assets, investors and analysts say.</p><p>\"We have the inflation story and then we have the Russian story,\" said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. In the event of an invasion, \"there will be some negative effect on markets, but I also think investors are incorporating this,\" he added.</p><p>Among individual U.S. stocks, Splunk rose 6.8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Cisco Systems had made a takeover offer worth more than $20 billion for the software maker.</p><p>Shares of airlines were hammered in Europe after reports that several were avoiding Ukraine's airspace. Budget carrier Wizz Air dropped 6.8%, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group lost 5.3% and Deutsche Lufthansa fell 3.8%.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 2.2% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 1%.</p><p>—Anna Hirtenstein, Caitlin Ostroff and Alex Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Dow, S&amp;P 500 Fall, Bond Yields Tick Up on Fear of Ukraine War</p>",
