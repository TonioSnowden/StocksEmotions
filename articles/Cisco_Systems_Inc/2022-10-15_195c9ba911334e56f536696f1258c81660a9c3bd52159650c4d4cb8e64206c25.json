  "text": "<p>\n  Other top-50 launchpad companies included insurers, steel producers, electronics wholesalers, auto-parts sellers and a half-dozen tech giants. Apple and Cisco scored relatively low when it came to hiring entry-level workers, but were better at sending employees on to bigger jobs elsewhere. </p><p>\n  An Apple spokesman questioned whether online data would accurately represent career changes of Apple's employees but declined to comment on the study's conclusions. A Cisco spokeswoman said the company sponsors a branded networking-technology training program, aimed at underserved communities, that has enrolled 17.5 million students globally. \"By focusing on skills, not just degrees, we hope to broaden economic opportunity and upward mobility,\" she said. </p><p>\n  Drugstore chains ranked high in large part because of the sheer volume of entry-level workers they tend to hire. CVS Health Corp. also stood out for its record of sending those workers on to better jobs elsewhere. </p><p>\n  Some current and former CVS employees say the data aligns with their experience. Reliable retail workers can be catapulted into roles with bigger responsibilities, becoming assistant managers or managers, relatively quickly, they say. Often, they can do the same by jumping to another company, since the skills tend to be readily transferable. </p><p>\n  Behind the pharmacy counter, something similar plays out with pharmacy technicians, who assist the pharmacist by counting pills, working the register, answering the phone, entering account details and more. </p><p>\n  Many states impose few job requirements on new pharmacy techs. On their feet all day, they field customers who may be ill or unhappy, and in some states they administer vaccines. They often are trained on the job -- when there is time, said Amanda Schiefelbein, a pharmacy technician at a CVS outside Madison, Wis. </p><p>\n  \"A lot of pharmacies are so short-staffed, many people are working 40-plus hours a week,\" said Ms. Schiefelbein, who has been a pharmacy tech for five years, including in supermarket pharmacies. </p><p>\n  Demand for techs is high, and so is turnover. A competing drugstore chain might pay a little more. Jobs with similar titles at a hospital or oncology-clinic pharmacy might look lateral on paper, but offer a more appealing quality of life, Ms. Shiefelbein said. </p><p>\n  She said she has seen some co-workers go on to become nurses or take other healthcare jobs. \"I think it's a good place for anyone going into the medical field,\" she said. </p><p>\n  T.J. Crawford, a CVS spokesman, said the chain has added new growth opportunities for pharmacy techs, including an apprenticeship program for careers in retail pharmacy and management. He said CVS is also updating its training programs, staffing models, and pharmacy technology. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Companies that provide stability </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  There are other companies that stand out for job stability, a combination of retention and wages. That trait could look more desirable for workers if the U.S. enters a recession and hiring slows. </p><p>\n  Several industries have many companies that fit this profile as defined by Burning Glass, including oil, gas and mining, technology, technology manufacturing, and aerospace and defense. Outside of those sectors, a few standouts were telecom Lumen Technologies Inc., pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and lender Freddie Mac. </p><p>\n  Despite the boom-and-bust nature of the oil-and-gas industry, eight companies in the Fortune 250 show up in the top quintile for job stability -- particularly those that operate refineries or pipelines or pump natural gas. </p><p>\n  The industry is known for paying well, said Amanda Rico, a Houston-based career consultant who works exclusively with people from the sector. That is one reason why industries outside of oil and gas tend to not like hiring oil and gas professionals, Ms. Rico said. \"Because they know they'll go running back to oil and gas when the business comes back,\" she said. </p><p>\n  Among the leading companies in the job-stability index is Exxon Mobil Corp. A likely reason for its strong showing in retention is that until 2020, the company had never announced a large-scale layoff. In October that year, Exxon said it would cut 15% of its global workforce, including about 1,900 jobs in the U.S., amid a pandemic-driven downturn in demand for oil and gas. </p><p>\n  Generally, Exxon has preferred to retain people, especially its high performers, through high salaries that Ms. Rico described as \"golden handcuffs.\" The company said it culls its workforce through an annual performance review and forced ranking process, in which low performers are put on improvement plans and terminated if they don't meet predetermined goals. </p><p>\n  Average tenure for Exxon employees is more than 30 years, according to company spokesman Casey Norton, who added that even within a high-paying industry, the company's compensation package \"is at the high end for many of our employees when we compare to our peers.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Among the Best </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Companies to Grow Within </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Places where workers ascend within the ranks </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- AT&amp;T </p><p>\n  -- Automatic Data Processing </p><p>\n  -- AutoZone </p><p>\n  -- Dollar General </p><p>\n  -- Gap </p><p>\n  -- Lowe's </p><p>\n  -- Macy's </p><p>\n  -- Nordstrom </p><p>\n  -- Sherwin-Williams </p><p>\n  -- Verizon </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Launchpads </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Springboards to better jobs elsewhere </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- CVS Health </p><p>\n  -- Expeditors International </p><p>\n  -- Fannie Mae </p><p>\n  -- Liberty Mutual Insurance </p><p>\n  -- Marsh &amp; McLennan </p><p>\n  -- Murphy USA </p><p>\n  -- Nucor </p><p>\n  -- State Farm Insurance </p><p>\n  -- United States Steel </p><p>\n  -- Verizon </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Where to Advance Without a Degree </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  College education is not necessarily required </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Albertsons </p><p>\n  -- Arrow Electronics </p><p>\n  -- Applied Materials </p><p>\n  -- AT&amp;T </p><p>\n  -- CDW </p><p>\n  -- Dollar Tree </p><p>\n  -- Estee Lauder </p><p>\n  -- Mastercard </p><p>\n  -- Synchrony </p><p>\n  -- U.S. Bancorp </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Job Stability </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ranked highly for retaining workers and paying them well </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Adobe </p><p>\n  -- Alphabet </p><p>\n  -- Boeing </p><p>\n  -- Eli Lilly </p><p>\n  -- Exxon Mobil </p><p>\n  -- Freddie Mac </p><p>\n  -- L3Harris </p><p>\n  -- Lumen </p><p>\n  -- Nvidia </p><p>\n  -- Raytheon </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Source: Burning Glass </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  METHODOLOGY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Burning Glass Institute and the Harvard Project on Managing the Future of Work used millions of online profiles and other data sources to analyze how workers at companies in the Fortune 250 fared from 2017 to 2021. </p><p>\n  It assigned scores to nine measures -- such as how many promotions employees received and the average time it took to move up one job level -- to arrive at an overall score. It also grouped the companies into a series of archetypes using certain combinations of the nine measures. Eight companies were left off the final ranking because sufficient data wasn't available to evaluate them. </p><p>\n  Researchers used Labor Department data to consider only occupations in which at least 30% of workers nationally lack a college degree to better identify companies that help the employees who need it most. So they examined the career trajectories of, for example, retail store managers, customer service representatives and web developers, but not lawyers or software engineers. They compared people across companies who are in the same occupations; administrative assistants at Microsoft were compared to administrative assistants at Southwest Airlines and Walmart, for example. </p><p>\n  It is the group's first attempt at such a study and it had some limits, according to its authors. Online data doesn't capture every employee, and likely skews more toward some jobs than others. College-educated workers are more likely to maintain online profiles than those with a high school education or less. So the authors created thresholds in determining which companies and occupations to include, and said the limitations applied more or less equally across the Fortune 250. </p><p></p>",
