The data obtained by the adversary in this case was not sensitive.\"</p><p>Cisco said the hacker was successfully removed, but \"displayed persistence, repeatedly attempting to regain access in the weeks following the attack; however, these attempts were unsuccessful.\"</p><p>No ransomware has been observed, and steps have been taken to \"further harden\" Cisco's IT environment, the networking giant said.</p><p>Cisco said it had confidence the hacker was an initial access broker with ties to the UNC2447 ransomware gang, the Lapsus$ cybercriminal group and Yanluowang ransomware operators. Earlier this year, Lapsus$ targeted systems at Okta Inc. OKTA and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.</p><p>Cisco shares are down 27% year to date, compared to the 8% decline by the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, of which it is a component.</p><p>Cisco says it was breached by hacker linked to notorious cybercrime groups</p>",
