  "text": "<p>Uncertainty over escalation between Russia and Ukraine and how quickly the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates has led to heightened volatility in markets.</p><p>Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was withdrawing troops from Crimea following the completion of military drills, as Western intelligence reports that Moscow could invade its neighbor didn't immediately materialize. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's secretary-general said Russia was continuing its military buildup around Ukraine.</p><p>\"Putin and Russia and Ukraine are clearly driving markets with a bit of a relief rally, but it remains to be seen whether it's short-lived or not,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research. \"Every new statement, every tiny piece of news, could push markets in either direction.\"</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Airbnb jumped 9% after the company posted record revenue. Cedar Fair shares declined more than 10% after SeaWorld Entertainment signaled it was unlikely to pursue a deal for the theme-park business after the latter rejected its approach. SeaWorld Entertainment fell 4%.</p><p>Roblox shares dropped more than 15% premarket after the social-gaming platform reported results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. ViacomCBS shares dipped more than 8% after the media giant also posted earnings that missed analysts' forecasts.</p><p>Investors are awaiting minutes from the Fed's January meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, for insight on the debate over the path for rate raises. Last month, U.S. inflation accelerated to a 7.5% annual rate, another four-decade high, increasing expectations that the Fed may have to increase rates faster and more aggressively.</p><p>\"You've got this backdrop of inflation, lack of confidence in central banks in being ahead of the curve, a non-orderly recovery in the global economy and supply lines and consumer demand and all that coming together is creating volatility,\" said David Coombs, London-based head of multiasset investments at Rathbone Investment Management. Potential escalation between Russia and Ukraine is \"the cherry on the top,\" he added.</p><p>The threat is shaking up a fragile global oil market, which will likely add to inflationary pressures, Mr. Coombs said. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 1.4% to $94.61 a barrel Wednesday, while benchmark European gas futures were flat. U.S. natural-gas futures rose 5.7%.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.035% from 2.044% Tuesday. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%. Major indexes in Asia closed higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.2% and South Korea's Kospi gained 2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.5% and mainland China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.6%.</p><p>Companies including Cisco Systems, American International Group and Nvidia are slated to post earnings after markets close.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Oil Rises, Stock Futures Edge Down as Investors Seek Clarity on Ukraine</p>",
