  "title": "Cisco Made $20 Billion-Plus Takeover Offer for Splunk; Bid was made recently though companies aren't currently in active talks, according to people familiar with the matter",
  "text": "<p>Should there be a deal, it would be Cisco's biggest ever, eclipsing the roughly $7 billion acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in 2005. Its most recent deal of size was its nearly $5 billion purchase of Acacia Communications Inc. in 2021.</p><p>Splunk is currently searching for a chief executive after Doug Merritt stepped down from the role in November after roughly six years following a series of disappointing earnings reports. The company named Chairman Graham Smith as interim CEO, a position he still holds.</p><p>Splunk shares rose sharply early in the pandemic as did those of a number of other technology companies with strong growth potential, but have almost fallen in half since then.</p><p>It isn't clear whether other potential suitors are circling Splunk.</p><p>Splunk, founded in 2003, makes software used by companies' information-technology and security operations to monitor and analyze data.</p><p>San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco sells routers, switches and security services as well as software products such as its Webex meeting application.</p><p>Cisco's interest shows that the networking giant—a serial acquirer, but usually of smaller companies—has an appetite for big deals.</p><p>And it has the wherewithal, with a market value of around $235 billion and more than $20 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p><p>Software has been a hot corner of the M&amp;A market lately, with a number of companies in the sector being snapped up by private-equity firms or other industry players. In one of the latest examples, Citrix Systems Inc. agreed to be taken private by a pair of private-equity firms in an acquisition valued at $16.5 billion, including debt.</p><p>Splunk said in June that technology-focused private-equity firm Silver Lake was making a $1 billion investment in the company to help support the transformation of the business. Splunk has been shifting from a traditional software-licensing arrangement to a cloud-based subscription model. An increase in the shares on news of that investment had evaporated by the close of trading Friday.</p><p>Cisco is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings Feb. 16, while Splunk reports March 2.</p><p>Write to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>Cisco Made $20 Billion-Plus Takeover Offer for Splunk</p>",
