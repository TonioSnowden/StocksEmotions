  "text": "<p>   \"It's not a 2001, in my opinion, or a 2008 scenario,\" said former Cisco Systems Inc. CEO John Chambers, who is now a venture capitalist. \"Marginal startups just will not get funded, but I actually think that's a healthy phenomenon.\" </p><p>   For venture capitalists who no longer have to jockey with  hedge funds, the slowdown comes as a relief. Mr. Sacks said his firm, Craft Ventures, has been able to invest in two late-stage companies without facing the competition from big money managers that, six months ago, would have driven the price much higher. </p><p>   Meanwhile, venture capitalists are clawing back some of the power they ceded to company founders when the market was hot. </p><p>   More deals now include protections such as so-called full ratchets, which ensure that investors can recoup the value of their investment in case a startup's valuation declines in a future funding round or public offering. Some investors are providing a startup with capital but not assigning a valuation until they can assess its revenue and losses at the end of the year. </p><p>   Startups should be prepared for things to get worse before they get better, according to J Zac Stein, president of human resources software startup Lattice. </p><p>   \"Many people join startups to embrace the struggle,\" he said. \"They may just get that opportunity.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Eliot Brown contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
