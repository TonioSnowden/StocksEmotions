  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Georgia Law: Does Wokeness Move Product?",
  "text": "<p>   Regarding your editorial \"Woke and Weak CEOs\" (April 2): Those corporate CEOs who have criticized Georgia's new voting law have made a smart, strategic decision based on hard facts. The facts are that the Republican Party is divided, essentially leaderless and has no organized array of smart, attractive policies. It has no strong, articulate spokesman and, so far, its opposition to proposed Democratic legislation is weak. </p><p>   On the other hand, the facts are that left-wing, vindictive, activist Democrats are in full control of the federal government. Every Democratic legislative proposal has as one of its objectives the perpetuation of a one-party, Democratic government. </p><p>   Future legal immigration, citizenship for the Dreamers, a predominantly left-wing mainstream media, socialist orientation of the rising generations, elimination of the filibuster and statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico will all support the Democrats' one-party goal. </p><p>   Those CEOs have seen the future and made the decision that best protects their companies. It is likely that more CEOs and some big Republican donors will perceive the future and follow. </p><p>    Brent Hall </p><p>   Meridian, Idaho </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Poor corporate America. CEOs are afraid to criticize China and afraid not to criticize America. Who can blame them? Their personal fortunes and the success of companies they lead are at stake. But so far there are no profiles in courage. They are succumbing to the autocrats in both countries. </p><p>    Alan Kline </p><p>   Ottawa Hills, Ohio </p><p>   --- </p><p>    I'm wondering what happened to the swarms of fact-checkers who once hovered over every Donald Trump statement. Were they all fired as a result of declining subscriber and viewer audiences on the left? Or is that a species that emerges only with the election of Republican majorities? </p><p>    Jim Schepker </p><p>   Niantic, Conn. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    It is unfortunate that so many CEOs try to pander to the woke left rather than practicing a bit of pragmatism. That said, CEOs of consumer-facing businesses often have a knack for messaging, and the Georgia GOP blew the messaging on the recently passed voter law. The perception of the rule on handing out water and umbrellas is an unforced error. The number of voters influenced by a bottle of water isn't likely to turn an election, but a lot of people see it as cold-blooded. No one reads the fine print about self-serve water stations, etc. And although you dismiss it as a useless platitude, the CEO of Cisco taking the position that we should be making it easier to vote, not harder, is both the correct thing to do and the correct message to send to the American people. </p><p>    Matt Elbert </p><p>   Houston </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Instead of spending the funds and energy to fight voter-ID laws, could companies mobilize volunteers and funds to help people get government-issued ID cards and Social Security cards? People without these items probably can't access regular banking services or benefits provided by the government intended to help. </p><p>   It would be hard to be a complete member of society without an ID card and Social Security card. So voting aside, these people shouldn't be prevented from fully participating in society due to lack of access, transportation or funds. </p><p>    Kitty Fyfe </p><p>   Irvine, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    The woke crowd claims that minorities cannot understand or comply with common-sense identification measures to ensure honest elections. These claims are condescending and indeed racist. It is sad that prominent CEOs are believing this fiction. </p><p>    James B. Wise </p><p>   Oklahoma City </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Executives are betting that support of progressive policies will buy them protection as left-wing bureaucracies and politicians garner increasing control in our society. It won't work. Big business will never be able to shift left enough to satisfy many progressive ideologues who disdain the concept of a profit motive. Neutrality was the best strategy, even if not always a comfortable one. </p><p>   When the left demands more than higher taxes, corporations will have few options other than to shower Democrats with even more campaign cash. Republican leaders will eventually realize, as many GOP voters already have, that their historical defense of free enterprise is no longer valued. Corporations will have few political allies, and deservedly so. </p><p>    John Keating </p><p>   Bellaire, Texas </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Is it lost on Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian that it is easier to vote in Georgia with the new law than to check a bag, go through TSA security and get on one of his airplanes for a flight? </p><p>    Greg Pilcher </p><p>   Silverton, Ore. </p><p></p>",
