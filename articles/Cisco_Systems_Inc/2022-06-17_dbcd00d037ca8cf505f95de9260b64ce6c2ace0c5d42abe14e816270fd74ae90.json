  "title": "A 'Star Wars' sequel in Ukraine? Iron Dome project seeks to protect country from missiles; Sky Project, funded by San Francisco-based tech company, aims to bolster Ukraine's air defenses from incoming missiles and rockets in plan similar to doomed U.S. effort under Reagan",
  "text": "<p>Code named Sky Project, the joint initiative is funded and supplied by JustAnswer, a San Francisco-based company with more than 250 employees in war-ravaged Ukraine. The project's other participants are the Lviv Military Administration, Ukraine Air Command West, Software Association of Japan, itSMF Japan and others, though the partnership would welcome funding from Ukraine's military.</p><p>Iron Dome is modeled after an anti-missile and -rocket system in Israel that has proved exceptionally effective. The plan in Ukraine, which did not receive assistance from Israel in developing the project, is to radically upgrade air defense in two stages — by revamping a command center, and 45 mobile monitoring centers that collect information about incoming missiles — to dramatically improve an air defense that currently only swats down 20% of Russian rockets and missiles.</p><p>Ukraine has \"an old, bad system that we are replacing in a startup-ey way with upgraded computer systems of sophisticated new hardware and software,\" Kurtzig, perhaps the tech industry's most vocal supporter of Ukraine, told MarketWatch. \"The U.S. has not helped to close the skies from Day One of this conflict,\" he said. His company has maintained operations in Ukraine since the war began, and he recently visited employees there.</p><p>\"My trip [in April] was wonderful and emotional, but there was also genuine fear,\" Kurtzig said. \"Air-raid sirens hit home to me. They deal with it nearly every day.\"</p><p>The air-defense modernization effort comes amid President Joe Biden's announcement on Wednesday of another $1 billion in weapons and aid for Ukraine, which has been a hotbed of tech innovation for expansion for U.S. companies for at least a decade.</p><p>Startups, midsize companies and major brands such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, Oracle Corp. ORCL, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO and Snap Inc. SNAP have made significant investments in Ukraine, a country that has been a vital resource for engineering talent, 3-D modeling and customer service.</p><p>Read more: Tech firms with employees in Ukraine spring emergency plans into place</p><p>The Ukrainian sky is also populated with drones. At least four Draganfly Medical Response drones are patrolling the air to deliver medical supplies, antibiotics and insulin to hard-to-reach areas that are being shelled by Russian forces.</p><p>Last week, Draganfly Inc. DPRO CEO Cameron Chell was in Ukraine helping launch more drones in the air.</p><p>A 'Star Wars' sequel in Ukraine? Iron Dome project seeks to protect country from missiles</p>",
