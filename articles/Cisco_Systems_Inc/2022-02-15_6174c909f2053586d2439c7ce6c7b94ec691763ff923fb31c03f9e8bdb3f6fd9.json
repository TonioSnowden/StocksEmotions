  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Cisco Systems Inc. needs to beef up its software business. There is no better time. </p><p>\n  The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that Cisco recently made an offer to acquire security and business intelligence software provider Splunk for more than $20 billion. The companies apparently aren't in active talks now, so it is far from assured that a deal will get done. But that price would represent a premium of at least 10% to Splunk's last closing value, making it three times the size of Cisco's largest deal to date. Splunk shares rose more than 9% Monday while Cisco's slipped by more than 1%. </p><p>\n  Cisco is historically known for networking equipment such as switches and routers, but it has been slowly diversifying over the past several years. Software accounts for about 30% of the company's annual revenue, and the bulk of that is sold on subscription-based terms. That leaves Cisco heavily exposed to hardware-based business that is growing more slowly and is highly cyclical and vulnerable to tech giants that prefer to design their own data-center gear. </p><p>\n  The company has averaged annual revenue growth of less than 1% over the past five years and has seen its annual sales decline in three of the past 10. </p><p>\n  Software figures heavily in Cisco's growth plans. The company told analysts last September that it expects to average 5% to 7% compound annual revenue growth between its last fiscal year and the one that concludes in July 2025. Cisco says it won't need large deals to get there; Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said at the time that \"valuations are a little extreme right now.\" </p><p>\n  But a lot has happened since, with investors largely rotating out of tech -- especially from relatively expensive cloud software stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Software &amp; Services Group is down 10% since Cisco's meeting, while the median forward revenue multiple for the BVP Nasdaq Cloud Computing Index has slid by 42% over that time. </p><p>\n  Splunk, which was trading around six times forward sales before Friday's report compared with 11 times a year ago, is one of the cheaper names in software. That isn't entirely due to market dynamics, though. The company has stumbled in an effort to transition its traditional software business to a cloudlike subscription model, resulting in its first-ever annual revenue decline in its fiscal year ended January 2021. And while growth has picked back up since, the drama is far from over. Splunk's shares lost more than one-quarter of their value in November alone after the company abruptly replaced CEO Doug Merritt with Chairman Graham Smith taking over on an interim basis. </p><p>\n  The turmoil has made some observers doubt whether buying Splunk would be the right move for Cisco, even given the relative bargain valuation. Brad Reback of Stifel said a sale at this point \"would be an admission there is no easy fix to the operational/strategic challenges the company has faced the last several years.\" And Adam Tindle of Raymond James noted that an investment by Silver Lake last year valued Splunk at $23 billion, which would mean either that the private-equity company would likely oppose a Cisco buyout near that range or that Splunk's business has deteriorated even further. </p><p>\n  Spunk might ultimately not be the right deal to justify any buyer diving deep into its coffers right now. Cisco has other options, though, and should be checking them out, too. </p><p></p>",
