  "title": "Stocks Pare Losses After Fed Minutes; Oil prices climb as investors assess mixed information on whether Russia-Ukraine tensions will escalate",
  "text": "<p>Fed officials at their meeting last month talked about stepping up their timetable for raising interest rates beginning with an anticipated increase in March, amid greater discomfort with high inflation.</p><p>While the minutes didn't appear to differ from the Fed's public comments, the market seemed to be relieved they didn't show an even more hawkish bent, some analysts said.</p><p>\"Officials didn't appear to be seriously considering either a 50 bp rate hike to start the tightening cycle or a hike at each of the remaining seven policy meetings this year,\" said Paul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>The Fed minutes also shifted the market's attention away from the situation in the Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was withdrawing troops from Crimea following the completion of military drills, as Western intelligence reports that Moscow could invade its neighbor didn't immediately materialize. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's secretary-general said Russia was continuing its military buildup around Ukraine.</p><p>\"Every new statement, every tiny piece of news, could push markets in either direction,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research.</p><p>The market's other main preoccupation, inflation, was also sending worrying signals. In the U.K., prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly 30 years in January. In the U.S.,retail sales rose 3.8% in January from December, more than economists had expected. The figures are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, and a number of analysts pointed out that the gains are mainly a result of rising prices.</p><p>What the reports reflect is that inflation may be about more than just monetary policy, said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter. Energy prices are rising and are a main driver of rising prices, and supply-chain disruptions are still an issue, which is also forcing prices higher, she said. \"I wonder whether inflation is going to be quite as transitory as thought,\" she added.</p><p>The market's volatility this week reflects a process that began months ago, as investors react to rising inflation and shifting monetary policy, and is likely just getting started, said Joseph Amato, the chief investment officer for equities at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>It showed up first in high-risk assets like crypto and unprofitable tech companies. It's not likely to pummel the broader markets, he said, but it does likely mean the major indexes will not perform like they have the past few years.</p><p>This \"repricing of risk\" will be the biggest factor throughout the year, he said, and investors should be prepared to live with more volatility. \"We haven't even seen a single rate hike yet and the market is whipping itself into a bit of a frenzy,\" he said.</p><p>Amongindividual stocks, ViacomCBS fell 19% and social-gaming company Roblox fell 26% after both posted earnings reports that missed analysts' forecasts.</p><p>Shopify fell 17% after the company posted earnings that beat forecasts but it said it expects revenue growth will slow in 2022 from the year prior.</p><p>Cedar Fair shares declined 6.2% after SeaWorld Entertainment signaled it was unlikely to pursue a deal for the theme-park business after the company rejected its approach. SeaWorld rose 1.3%.</p><p>Airbnb shares rose 5.3% after the company posted record revenue, while Kraft Heinz rose 5.2% after its profit and sales beat expectations. Companies set to post earnings after markets close include Cisco Systems, American International Group and Nvidia.</p><p>\"You've got this backdrop of inflation, lack of confidence in central banks in being ahead of the curve, a non-orderly recovery in the global economy and supply lines and consumer demand and all that coming together is creating volatility,\" said David Coombs, London-based head of multiasset investments at Rathbone Investment Management. Potential escalation between Russia and Ukraine is \"the cherry on the top,\" he added.</p><p>The threat is shaking up a fragile global oil market, which will likely add to inflationary pressures, Mr. Coombs said. U.S. crude oil rose 1.7% to $93.65 a barrel. U.S. natural-gas futures rose 9.3%.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.049% from 2.044% Tuesday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose less than 0.1%. Major indexes in Asia closed higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.2%, and South Korea's Kospi gained 2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.5%, and mainland China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.6%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Pare Losses After Fed Minutes</p>",
