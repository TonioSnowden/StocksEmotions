  "title": "In Russia, No Air Bags, Costly Toilets and Old Hollywood Movies Are Sanctions Fallout; Russians are paying higher prices or seeking substitutes for certain goods, and Moscow is scrapping some safety measures to cope",
  "text": "<p>In Russia today, dealers can sell new cars without air bags or anti-lock brakes. Toilets and sinks are in short supply. And one of the few Hollywood movies in theaters is a nine-year-old hit, \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Inventories are running low as sanctions begin to hit consumers. Businesses and consumers are paying up for scarce products like car parts, where prices for some are up seven times. Or they are making do with old movies and inferior substitutes.</p><p>The situation will likely get worse. Equipment for screening airline passengers and luggage is approaching the end of its authorized lifespan, a group of airports said. The government can either keep using the equipment or search passengers by hand. Stores, meanwhile, are draining their inventories of toilet bowls, faucets and sinks, leading to a price spike.</p><p>The shortages have emerged as a real world indicator of the impact of Western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Though economists expect the country to enter a deep recession this year, Moscow has so far been able to use cash from the sale of high-price oil and gas to cushion the blow.</p><p>But as Russia's new deficit economy begins to take shape, the shortages highlight the challenges ahead for the Russian economy, which has for years been deeply reliant on Western imports.</p><p>\"The government is trying to soften the blow, but that's all they can do,\" said Ivan Fedyakov, chief executive at St. Petersburg-based consulting firm INFOLine. \"They cannot reverse the situation, so we will inevitably see an economic slowdown, a reduction in consumer spending, and a general worsening of most economic indicators.\"</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has played down the impact of the war, saying that the West's economic blitzkrieg has failed. The government has doubled down on its policy of import substitution, which aims to replace foreign goods with homemade ones, despite years of effort that yielded scanty results.</p><p>Some officials are beginning to acknowledge the problems and long-term challenges facing the Russian economy. Analysts at the Russian Central Bank predict a period of reverse industrialization, meaning economic growth based on less sophisticated technology. Russian Sen. Andrey Klishas said that the import-substitution program has failed.</p><p>\"Except for the bravura reports of the sectoral departments, there is nothing,\" Mr. Klishas wrote on Telegram last month. \"Our people see this in the sphere of consumer goods and in many other areas.\"</p><p>To counteract the deficits, the government has allowed imports of goods against the will of the companies that make them, declaring that these goods were exempt from trademark laws. The list includes electronic components from manufacturers such as Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp., Motorola Solutions Inc. and Siemens AG as well as industrial goods such as paper, textiles, ceramics, locomotives and nuclear reactors. And some new homemade products have hit the shelves in the stead of brands departing Russia, including CoolCola, Fancy and Street, replacing Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite respectively.</p><p>Airlines have had to reduce their fleets as they lack parts. Pobeda Airlines, the low-cost subsidiary of Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot Russian Airlines PJSC, has cut the number of Boeing 737-800s that it flies to 25 from 41 so that its stock of spare parts can last until it can find new supply channels.</p><p>The state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation, Russia's largest aircraft manufacturing group, said in April that it is boosting production of long-range Tu-214 jets, first launched in the 1990s. They are needed to replace planes from Boeing and Airbus, which have suspended services in Russia, and as the company lacks parts for its own new and more sophisticated models.</p><p>Airport security equipment, meanwhile, is reaching its legal expiration date, an association of Russian airports warned the Transport Ministry last month. The association said security staff will be forced to manually inspect passengers and their luggage unless the government extends the expiration date. Substituting the equipment with homemade versions would take at least five years, the association said. The Transport Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In the film industry, movie theaters have been rerunning old Hollywood and Soviet films after Walt Disney Co., Sony Group Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. stopped releasing new films in Russia. The most talked-about screening in late May was \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie about Wall Street corruption.</p><p>The reruns haven't stemmed losses. At a chain of movie theaters in the Urals and western Siberia, attendance is down around 70% to 80% since the Feb. 24 invasion, its owner estimated. </p><p>A showing of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' in Moscow. PHOTO: The Wall Street Journal</p><p>\"We're reaching a crisis point,\" said the owner, who didn't want to be identified. He has stayed open because the shopping malls that house his theaters have offered free rent since March, which he expects to end soon.</p><p>Asked how the government can help, he said: \"By stopping the war.\"</p><p>Auto production in Russia was down 61% in April compared with last year, likely as a result of parts shortages, government data showed. In early May, the government relaxed regulations for automobiles, allowed cars produced in the country to be sold without air bags, anti-lock braking-system sensors and electronic stability-control technology that improves a vehicle's handling. These cars haven't hit dealer lots yet.</p><p>Nikita Novikov, an editor of the automotive publication speedme.ru, had always been hopeful that one day Russians could afford top quality European cars and that Russia's car industry would produce its own top-of-the-line makes.</p><p>Except for a few wealthy Russians, that dream has been set back by at least a decade, he said. \"The rest will be driving Ladas without ABS,\" he said. \"We're returning to the '90s. It's a very big disappointment.\"</p><p>In Bryansk, a city near Ukraine in southern Russia, some people have stopped repairing their cars, said Igor, a 36-year-old owner of an auto-repair shop. The Wall Street Journal agreed to use only his first name.</p><p>His customers are put off by high prices and the lower quality of spare parts from China and Turkey that are now more common than European parts. \"They come, I quote them a price, and they leave,\" he said. Parts that were 2,000 rubles, or about $30, are now 15,000, he said.</p><p>Igor said he thinks Russia won't see the kind of shortages the Soviet Union had near its end. But he said it would be experienced as a deficit economy nonetheless.</p><p>\"The shelves won't be empty,\" he said. \"But we won't be able to buy the product even though it's there.\"</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Evan Gershkovich at evan.gershkovich@wsj.com</p><p>In Russia, No Air Bags, Costly Toilets and Old Hollywood Movies Are Sanctions Fallout</p>",
