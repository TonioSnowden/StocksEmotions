  "title": "Here's how Palo Alto Networks stacks up against its main competitors; The company hit it out of the park with its earnings report. But Palo Alto has several rivals also expected to keep growing rapidly",
  "text": "<p>Other factors that may have helped lift Palo Alto's shares included an expansion of its buyback program and a three-for-one stock split planned for Sept. 14.</p><p>During fiscal 2022, Palo Alto's sales increased by 29% to $5.502 billion. The company's gross profit increased by 27% to $3.783 billion. But that was outweighed by operating expenses totaling $3.972 billion, for an operating loss of $189 million. The diluted net loss per share for fiscal 2022 was $2.71, narrowing from a loss of $5.18 a share in fiscal 2021.</p><p>For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company was profitable, with EPS of 3 cents. It also expected to be profitable on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2023.</p><p>But from the immediate reaction, it is clear that investors are fixated on Palo Alto's sales growth.</p><p>What about its competitors? In its annual report for fiscal 2021, Palo Alto listed five \"main competitors\" by name: Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. CHKP, Fortinet Inc., FTNT, Zscaler Inc.
