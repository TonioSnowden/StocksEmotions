  "title": "Stock Futures, Oil Fall as Russia Said to Continue Its Troop Buildup; Walmart and Palantir are set to report earnings early Thursday",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have come under pressure from the escalation in tensions between Russia and Western allies over Ukraine. The White House warned that a Russian invasion could be imminent, and diplomatic efforts have so far been inconclusive. Moscow said that it had pulled back some troops, which spurred a rally in markets earlier in the week. Western officials said Wednesday that Russia was actually continuing its military buildup.</p><p>\"We've got to put more focus on what's being done on the ground, rather than what's being said,\" said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. \"My presumption is that this will be sorted out diplomatically. If markets go down a lot more, then I would think it would be an opportunity to buy.\"</p><p>He isn't expecting a major change from Russia while its ally, China, hosts the Winter Olympics. The Games conclude this weekend so \"we still have a little while to go before we can feel things have really dissipated on a permanent basis,\" Mr. Jackson said. \"In the interim, it's a propaganda game.\"</p><p>Oil prices wavered. Global benchmark Brent crude fell 1.1% to $93.75 a barrel, after rising in the Asian session, as traders monitored the Russia-Ukraine situation.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.003% Thursday from 2.044% on Wednesday.</p><p>The Russian ruble weakened 0.7% against the dollar. The currency has seesawed in recent days as investors tried to gauge the severity of the tensions. It is currently down 1% for the year.</p><p>U.S. earnings season is ongoing, with Walmart and Palantir Technologies set to report ahead of the opening bell. Cisco Systems rose 3.5% in off-hours trading after reporting revenue and earnings that came above Wall Street's expectations, plus a $15 billion increase to its stock-buyback program. Nvidia slipped 2.6% despite the chip company reporting record sales and forecast another rise in revenue. Its automotive segment declined as supply-chain constraints weighed on production.</p><p>Toy maker Hasbro offhours rose 3% after an activist investor began a proxy fight and pushed for a spinoff.</p><p>The latest data on jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, is set to go out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting claims to continue to edge down as the tight labor market moves past Omicron-related disruptions.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked down 0.1%. Shares of Kering rose 6% after it reported earnings well above the pre-pandemic period, driven by a strong performance by its core brand Gucci. Commerzbank climbed 5% after the German bank swung back to net profit, beating analysts' expectations.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index was little changed, rising less than 0.1% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures, Oil Fall as Russia Said to Continue Its Troop Buildup</p>",
