  "text": "<p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average had expected adjusted earnings of 82 cents a share on revenue of $12.73 billion. Shares gained more than 3% in after-hours trading immediately following the results, after closing with down slightly in regular trading at $46.66.</p><p>\"We had a strong end to our fiscal year thanks to our Q4 performance,\" Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a statement. \"Our teams executed well in the midst of an incredibly dynamic environment, resulting in the highest full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the history of the company.\"</p><p>Cisco'sprevious earnings report sparked concerns about business spending on technology, as the company's forecast missed expectations. At the time, executives focused more on supply-chain issues and effects from the Russian invasion of Ukraine as reasons for the miss, and fears of a widespread slowdown for purchases of networking gear have dissipated amid solid results from competitors like Arista Networks Inc. ANETand Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR</p><p>Wednesday's forecast was even more important, as it provided executives' expectations for the full new fiscal year, which began on Aug. 1. Cisco's forecast calls for adjusted earnings of $3.49 to $3.56 a share on revenue growth of 4% to 6%, after the previously fiscal year wrapped with adjusted earnings of $3.36 a share and sales of $51.56 billion. Analysts on average were projecting fiscal-year adjusted earnings of $3.53 a share on sales of $52.72 billion, which would reflect revenue growth of 2.2%.</p><p>For the fiscal first quarter, Cisco executives guided for 82 cents to 84 cents a share in adjusted profit and revenue growth of 2% to 4% in the fiscal first quarter. Analysts were forecasting adjusted earnings of 84 cents and a year-over-year revenue decline of roughly 3%, according to FactSet.</p><p>Cisco's stock is down 26% so far in 2022, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, which counts Cisco as a component, has declined 6%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX is off 10% this year.</p><p>Cisco earnings and revenue forecast quell fears of slowdown, sending stock higher</p>",
