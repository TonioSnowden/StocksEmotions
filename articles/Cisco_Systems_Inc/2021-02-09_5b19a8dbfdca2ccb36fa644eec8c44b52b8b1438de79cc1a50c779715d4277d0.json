Some analysts warn the group's strong-arm lobbying tactics could prove counterproductive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa66e8dc-afb1-4a50-8dfa-338a599ad82d\">writes Jamie Smyth</a>.</p> <p>Facebook has also warned it will stop users in Australia from sharing news on its platform if the legislation is passed.</p> <p>MEPs working on the draft digital regulations — the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act — told the Financial Times the laws could be amended as they pass through the EU parliament. These include the option of binding arbitration for licensing agreements and requiring tech companies to inform publishers about changes to how they rank news stories on their sites.
