  "title": "PeakSpan Capital Raises $567 Million for Growth-Stage Software Deals; The software focused growth investment firm's third fund is its largest to date, and more than double the size of its 2018 predecessor",
  "text": "<p>PeakSpan typically makes growth investments ranging from $8 million to $25 million in business-to-business software companies, often those that are owner operated and have yet to take on much or any outside capital, according to Mr. Dur. The firm looks for companies that are generating as little as $4 million to as much as $25 million in annual revenue.</p><p>\"We're focused on helping that owner-operator who has just made it through the woods, scale their first peak, assess the landscape and figure out where to go from there,\" Mr. Dur said.</p><p>The firm targets 12 business software subsectors, including human capital management, supply chain management, e-commerce services, customer experience and infrastructure software. Companies it has backed in recent months include procurement software provider Simfoni Ltd. and shipping software company Hawk Applications Corp., which does business as ShipHawk Inc.</p><p>PeakSpan has navigated a competitive investment market partly by emphasizing the expertise of its now 25-member team to prospects and its proprietary technology platforms that help entrepreneurs with sector intelligence as well as tasks such as lead generation, market or competitor analysis and customer satisfaction data, Mr. Dur said. The tech platforms use artificial intelligence to collect data about specific sectors and companies from across the internet, amassing and analyzing roughly 1 terabyte of data a month, he said.</p><p>\"If you're just offering capital, you're offering a commodity,\" he said. \"We see capital as one ingredient in what is a delicious product\" that the firm offers, he added.</p><p>PeakSpan's recent full or partial exits over the past year and a half include the sales of e-commerce software provider Ecwid Inc. to publicly traded Lightspeed Commerce Inc. and security software provider Kenna Security Inc. to Cisco Systems Inc. Also, PeakSpan sold part of its stake in sales intelligence software provider Cognism Ltd. as part of a $87.5 million financing deal the company announced earlier this month, according to Mr. Dur.</p><p>PeakSpan was formed in 2015 by Mr. Dur and fellow co-founders Brian Mulvey and Matt Melymuka, who are both managing partners as well. All three had previously worked at Investor Growth Capital.</p>",
