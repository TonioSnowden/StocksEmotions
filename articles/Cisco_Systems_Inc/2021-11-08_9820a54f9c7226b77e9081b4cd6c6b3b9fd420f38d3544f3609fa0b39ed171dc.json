  "text": "<p>The 4G network built and launched in Japan by my company, Rakuten, is the world's first large-scale deployment of OpenRAN technology. We are now working to build a similar network with 1&amp;1, a German telecoms firm. Other operators, including Dish in America, and Telefónica and Vodafone in Europe, are also adopting OpenRAN.</p><p>This approach has many advantages over the traditional, proprietary way of doing things. The first is lower costs: in our experience, a reduction of 30-40% in capital expenditure and operating costs for 4G networks, and as much as 50% for 5G networks. In Japan, known for its costly mobile-network charges, this has enabled us to cut the average monthly bill by 60%. More than 4m customers have signed up in the past year, despite the pandemic, which hampered the operation of many of our bricks-and-mortar stores. OpenRAN provides a way to depoliticise the roll-out of 5G</p><p>OpenRAN networks cost less to run because many of the proprietary infrastructure components are replaced by software, at a fraction of the price. Network operators no longer need large teams of engineers to deploy and maintain their base stations. In our network, new sites are brought on air automatically and updates are carried out remotely via software.</p><p>Second, OpenRAN networks are safer and more secure than proprietary technology. Their open architecture lets operators decide what they put in their networks. No single vendor controls the system. Our supply chain is transparent. We know exactly what is going into our network—and, for the record, we use no Chinese equipment. The open architecture makes it easy to respond to any problems by switching out software or hardware. Our network has no black boxes.</p><p>OpenRAN should be music to the ears of security hawks, and those worried about the security implications of trusting a single supplier, particularly in Western countries where network operators have been advised not to use equipment made by Huawei, the leading Chinese vendor, on security grounds. OpenRAN provides a way to depoliticise the roll-out of 5G.</p><p>All this will also boost competition. Little wonder, then, that OpenRAN faces opposition from entrenched incumbents. Some claim that our new technology consumes more energy than traditional systems, for example. In fact the opposite is true. Because it is software-based, an OpenRAN network can be flexibly scaled to meet demand, optimising energy consumption. When demand is high, it scales up to handle it, and when demand is low at night, it scales down. And as data centres become steadily more energy-efficient, so does the network. Sceptics also suggest that OpenRAN networks do not work in cities. But our network serves subscribers in some of the largest and densest cities in the world: Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. In early 2022 we aim to cover 96% of Japan's population with 4G. Independent research found that our network in Tokyo outperformed comparable networks in Berlin, London and Rome.</p><p>Open sesame</p><p>More affordable connectivity will cause an industrial shake-up in the coming years. Instead of proprietary systems built by a handful of incumbents, OpenRAN offers new suppliers, both large and small, the opportunity to get into the mobile-infrastructure market. Our network relies on equipment from a range of suppliers, including radio-access technology from Nokia, routers and switches from Cisco and other hardware from NEC. The software was provided by Altiostar (recently acquired by Rakuten) and Robin.io.</p><p>Rakuten has established a new division, called Symphony, to bring together these parts and share our expertise with network operators in other countries. By the end of 2022, we hope more telecoms firms around the world will be singing along to OpenRAN's tune.</p><p>Tareq Amin: chief executive, Rakuten Symphony</p><p>■</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2022 under the headline “The open future of mobile telecoms”</p>",
