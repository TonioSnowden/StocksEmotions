  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>It is a bold commentator that tries to predict the conclusion of the diplomatic game of chess that is the Ukraine-Russia border crisis. But the next seven days will produce some significant moves, if not an attempt at checkmate.</p> <p>Perhaps the strangest event of the week will be on Thursday, when Russia, as current head of the UN Security Council, is due to chair a discussion at the body's global headquarters in New York about the Ukraine crisis.</p> <p>But before then we have the new German chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c61ed027-ca55-43d4-88f1-60f8cde13f6e\">Olaf Scholz travelling to Moscow and Kyiv</a> to try to ease the tension. He follows in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16cd11e8-b800-4846-b977-c1349da38759\">France's Emmanuel Macron</a> and UK prime minister Boris Johnson — and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26d7e3d5-dd06-4117-a889-9a7d6735f920\">stakes are high</a> for all European economies — but Scholz's meetings have a particular significance given Germany's need for a new Ostpolitik, or eastern policy, as Timothy Garton Ash explained <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d9b6d06-848e-4060-a4a0-a9a700e28bd9\">in his FT opinion</a> piece this week.</p> <p>On Wednesday, attention will switch to Nato, where defence chiefs from the member nations are gathering in Brussels. </p> <p>It's then back to Germany on Friday as the Munich Security Conference begins. Speakers include Kamala Harris, US vice-president. She is expected to use her trip to meet US allies and partners to deter Russian aggression. It will therefore be a test of her diplomatic skills.</p> <p>But perhaps this week will not be the catalyst for action. Mindy Kotler, a director of Asia Policy Point, and a loyal Week Ahead subscriber, got in touch — at <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a> — to say that next week features Defender of the Fatherland Day (Soviet Army Day), a national holiday in Russia, noting that it “looks like a good day for an invasion.” Hmm. Perhaps, Mindy.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>The story of 2022, inflation, will be back with another instalment this week as India, China, Japan, the US, the UK and Canada all report data in one form or another — consumer price index or producer price index figures. Employment data are also due from the UK and the EU. Elsewhere, Japan updates us on its quarterly GDP plus the Fed and Reserve Bank of Australia publish their policy meeting minutes.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>Food is a theme for this week's corporate earnings, with analyst calls for the heavyweights of supermarket retailing on either side of the Atlantic — <strong>Carrefour</strong> and <strong>Walmart </strong>— as well as consumer goods companies. </p> <p>Investors in the former will be looking for signs of progress in chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3078c47e-8a30-4c33-a4bc-1f2b390b5226\">Alexandre Bompard's turnround strategy</a>. Expectations are higher for Walmart, the world's largest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which has already raised guidance for the full-year earnings it will report on Thursday. However, both companies are under pressure from the global forces of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3e973df-d6da-48c2-a43c-3a8acc2f1a5c\">supply chain snarl-ups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\">rising inflation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Nestlé</strong> has been one of the market's favourite consumer goods companies under chief executive Mark Schneider. He has shifted its portfolio into fast-growing areas such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e437608e-b8b7-40e0-809d-7385a10a4be5\">plant-based foods</a>, meal kits and pet food. But its 2021 figures, due on Thursday, will reflect a tough comparison with a year earlier, when coronavirus lockdowns boosted sales of items such as coffee. Investors will also be scrutinising how the world's largest food company expects to deal with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50019155-2ae9-4659-97db-d7aeae116f42\">rampant cost inflation</a> that has cut into rivals' margins.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>India, January consumer price index (CPI) figures</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, Q4 GDP data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Office for National Statistics report into homeworking and spending during the pandemic</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Michelin</strong> FY, <strong>Raizen</strong> Q3, <strong>Toshiba</strong> Q3</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, Q4 GDP and employment data plus December goods trade figures</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, ZEW economic sentiment survey</p></li>  <li><p>Hungary, Poland: Q4 GDP</p></li>  <li><p>India, trade data</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, December industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, employment data plus quarterly productivity estimate</p></li>  <li><p>US, January producer price index (PPI) figures</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Airbnb</strong> Q4, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> H1, <strong>Randstad</strong> Q4, <strong>ViacomCBS</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Canada, China, UK: January CPI figures</p></li>  <li><p>EU, industrial production data</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, January trade balance figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, December house price data</p></li>  <li><p>US, Federal Open Market Committee releases minutes of its January meeting plus retail sales and industrial production data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Barrick Gold</strong> Q4, <strong>Carrefour</strong> FY, <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> Q2, <strong>Heineken</strong> FY, <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong> Q4, <strong>Nvidia</strong> Q4, <strong>Schindler</strong> FY, <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> FY</p></li> </ul> <h2>Thursday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, European Central Bank monthly economic bulletin</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, December trade balance figures</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, monthly inflation data</p></li>  <li><p>US, residential construction figures</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Air France-KLM</strong> Q4, <strong>Airbus</strong> FY, <strong>AutoStore</strong> Q4, <strong>Commerzbank</strong> FY, <strong>Kering</strong> FY, <strong>Moneysupermarket.com</strong> FY, <strong>Nestlé</strong> FY, <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> FY, <strong>Repsol</strong>&#xa0;Q4, <strong>Walmart</strong> FY</p></li> </ul> <h2>Friday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Canada, December retail trade figures</p></li>  <li><p>EU, consumer confidence data</p></li>  <li><p>France, Q4 employment figures plus January CPI data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, January retail sales figures</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Allianz</strong> FY, <strong>EDF</strong> FY, <strong>Eni</strong>&#xa0;FY, <strong>John</strong> <strong>Deere </strong>Q1, <strong>NatWest</strong> FY, <strong>Norwegian Air</strong> Q4, <strong>Renault</strong> Q4, <strong>Segro</strong> FY </p></li> </ul> <h1>World events</h1> <p>Finally, here is a rundown of other events and milestones this week. </p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro to visit Russia</p></li>  <li><p>German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to visit Ukraine in an effort to ease tensions over the build-up of Russian forces on the border.
