  "title": "The Sabbatical, a Power Move for the Burnout Era; Some employees find the antidote to work stress and anxiety is a long company-sponsored break from their jobs",
  "text": "<p>\"When it was time to go back to work, I realized that I was still so exhausted,\" said Ms. Miller, who lives in Oakland, Calif.</p><p>Instead of joining the millions of people who have left their jobs recently, Ms. Miller, 35 years old, took a paid six-week sabbatical.</p><p>Workers are putting in more hours than ever nearly two years into the pandemic. They are in many cases burned out and believe a prolonged break is the best respite. Surprisingly, some companies agree. Employees who take sabbaticals say they return to work energized and more productive. Managers who are worried about retaining top talent and how the Covid-19 era is wearing on employees' well-being find sabbaticals engender loyalty and greater creativity.</p><p>Sabbaticals still aren't mainstream: 5% of companies offered them in 2019, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. The organization doesn't have data on what's happened to the perk during the pandemic or whether people remain at their jobs long term after taking a sabbatical. But several high-profile banks have recently started to offer them and smaller companies are trying them out as well.</p><p>Late last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. started offering six-week unpaid sabbaticals to people who have been with the bank for at least 15 years, following an early 2021 move by Citigroup Inc. to give employees in North America with at least five years' service up to 12 weeks off at 25% of their base pay. A Citigroup spokeswoman said more than 200 employees have been approved to take sabbaticals as part of this program.</p><p>Juraj Pal, former head of product at the polling-software startup Slido, was living in New York City last winter and had spent six years with his company from its early days. Over time, work had become his entire identity.</p><p>\"If you invited me for dinner and asked me who I am, I would talk about the company, and if you asked me if I had hobbies, I'd say, 'I don't have hobbies,' and I'd even feel good about it,\" said Mr. Pal, 28.</p><p>As the startup went through a reorganization and a subsequent acquisition by Cisco Systems Inc. Mr. Pal started to feel he was no longer a good match for the culture. He ended up in a conversation with the startup's CEO at the time, Peter Komornik, who suggested a real break.</p><p>\"My first response was, I didn't want to hear about it,\" said Mr. Pal. \"Any extended time off was somehow a sign of failure, a sign of weakness even.\"</p><p>He worked through that resistance with his executive coach as well as his wife and best friend, both of whom worked at the company. He eventually agreed to take several months off last spring. It took weeks for him to turn off his brain from work. A month in, he and his wife rented a place in Lake Tahoe, where he spent time hiking with his dog and participating in career development groups.</p><p>Mr. Pal's boss proposed he come back to a different role, which he did. Six months later he decided to leave Cisco to join a company whose program he'd participated in while on his break.</p><p>\"It's important mostly for mental health, at least it was for me, to think not about myself just through the lens of work,\" he said of his sabbatical.</p><p>Mr. Komornik, now the general manager of Slido under Cisco, said he thinks of sabbaticals as medicine that should be dispensed judiciously. One hard worker might benefit from a break after three years of incredible work, he said, while someone else may not need one after six years. When it came to Mr. Pal, Mr. Komornik felt he was long overdue for a break and didn't want him to feel guilty about considering other opportunities.</p><p>\"We were actually both very open when he went to the sabbatical that he might be leaving,\" Mr. Komornik said. \"It's very important for people to do this because only if they do, then they can be certain if they stay for the right reasons or if they leave, they leave for the right reasons.\"</p><p>One study of 50 people who took extended time off from work found that most of the interview subjects suffered from \"functional workaholism,\" according to the Sabbatical Project, which conducted the research. Many reported that a negative event, such as the end of a long relationship or death of a family member, prompted them to take a break. Of the 50 interviewed, 20 took company-sponsored sabbaticals, and 16 of those employees returned to work and stayed at their jobs for at least a year, according to DJ DiDonna, the Sabbatical Project's founder.</p><p>Catherine Merritt, CEO of Spool Marketing in Chicago, said she started offering her employees sabbaticals this past fall after seeing pandemic-induced burnout take a toll on her workforce. Employees who've been with the company for three years can take three paid weeks off in addition to their vacation time.</p><p>Offering longer breaks as a perk to work toward is another way to attract and hang on to top talent, Ms. Merritt said.</p><p>\"This summer, as we were trying to grow, it was really hard to find employees,\" she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you taken a break from work?

Join the conversation below.</p><p>Anna Binder, head of people for Asana, says the key to making sure one person's sabbatical doesn't become a burden for others is distributing the work among team members and identifying what projects can be put on hold. \"This only works when we make sure that sabbatical plans are co-created at least three months in advance,\" she said.</p><p>Steve Dakin, a director of engineering with Adobe Inc., has taken three sabbaticals across nearly two decades of working for the software maker, where taking them is ingrained in the culture.</p><p>\"If you don't take it, people look at you strangely,\" said Mr. Dakin, 54.</p><p>An Adobe spokesman said that between July and September of 2021, close to 600 employees in the U.S. took sabbaticals.</p><p>For his first two sabbaticals in 2011 and 2015, Mr. Dakin took multiweek road trips through national parks. He said he believes the financial costs of paying people to not work for a stretch are outweighed by the benefits to morale and spread of knowledge and skills around the company.</p><p>\"When you're gone, all the work that you're doing needs to get picked up by somebody,\" said Mr. Dakin. \"Your manager gets to see, wow, this person is really important.\"</p><p>During his most recent six-week break last fall, Mr. Dakin redid his home office in San Jose, Calif., and traveled to Yosemite National Park, Oregon and Hawaii. All of his sabbaticals, he said, have helped him gain a broader perspective that is harder to have when he's in the thick of work.</p><p>\"I'm as engaged as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I never thought I'd be anywhere for 17 years.\"</p><p>The Sabbatical, a Power Move for the Burnout Era</p>",
