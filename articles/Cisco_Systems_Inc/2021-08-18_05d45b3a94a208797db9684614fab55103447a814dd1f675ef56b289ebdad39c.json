The Fed's bond-buying program and lower interest rates have helped the stock market power higher, with major indexes notching records earlier this week.</p><p>\"As long as policy remains reasonably supportive, growth continues and we keep increasing our vaccination, it is a strange environment where conditions are good for equities,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"There is genuine economic strength.\"</p><p>Investors also don't have many alternatives to putting money into stocks, according to Mr. Kamal. Markets aren't sure what direction to go in, and the Fed minutes will offer some crucial insights into policy makers' futures steps, he said. \"The Fed has shown they are really scared of upsetting the market,\" Mr. Kamal added.</p><p>Money managers say they expect that markets may waver as investors weigh increasing cases of Covid-19 and the Delta variant against positive factors such as a strong earnings season and stimulus measures.
