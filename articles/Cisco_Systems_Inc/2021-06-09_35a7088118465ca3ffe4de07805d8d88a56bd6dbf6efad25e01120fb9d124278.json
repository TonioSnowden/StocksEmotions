  "text": "<p>\n  As cyberattacks become more frequent, the demand for cybersecurity-related services is booming. And that may be something investors can take advantage of. One of the most direct options is to invest in an exchange-traded fund that focuses on cybersecurity. Funds that invest in providers of hardware, software, products and services in cybersecurity have continued to crop up since the first came to market in 2014. </p><p>\n  \"If you think cybersecurity is an interesting area for growth, but you don't know which company is best positioned to take advantage of this growth, an ETF could be a good bet,\" says Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research at Morningstar. </p><p>\n  There are caveats. Thematic funds tend to be riskier than broad market plays, and so aren't suitable as a building block of a core portfolio, Mr. Johnson says. In addition, he says, by the time you're seeing headlines around a particular investing theme, investor enthusiasm generally is already priced in. </p><p>\n  Investors who own a cybersecurity ETF likely won't need more than one, Mr. Johnson says. Roughly half of cybersecurity ETF holdings overlap, on average, which means their performances can be dramatically different. But, Mr. Johnson says, the leading stocks typically are also found in tech and growth funds, which can lead a portfolio to overconcentrate in cybersecurity. </p><p>\n  Here's a look at some available cybersecurity ETFs. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK) tracks the Prime Cyber Defense Index. The fund covers such subcategories as systems software, communications equipment, application software, research and consulting services. </p><p>\n  Inception: Nov. 11, 2014 </p><p>\n  Expense Ratio: 0.60% </p><p>\n  Net assets as of June 5: $2.17 billion </p><p>\n  One-year annualized market price return as of June 4: 32.04% </p><p>\n  Three-year: 15.90% </p><p>\n  Five-year: 19.20% </p><p>\n  Top holdings as of June 5: Cisco Systems Inc., a developer and manufacturer of networking, cloud and security products, BlackBerry Ltd., a developer of security software and services, and Proofpoint Inc., an enterprise security company. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR) seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before fees and expenses) of its index, the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index. To be included in this fund, a security must be listed on an index-eligible global stock exchange and classified as a cybersecurity company as determined by the Consumer Technology Association. For instance, each security must have a world-wide market capitalization of at least $250 million and have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of $1 million. </p><p>\n  Inception: July 6, 2015 </p><p>\n  Expense Ratio: 0.60%. </p><p>\n  Net assets as of June 4: $3.66 billion </p><p>\n  One-year annualized market price return as of June 4: 34.04% </p><p>\n  Three-year: 17.90% </p><p>\n  Five-year: 20.10% </p><p>\n  Top holdings as of June 4: Cisco Systems, Accenture PLC, a provider of management consulting and technology services, and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., a provider of cloud-based security technology. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG), according to its fund summary, focuses on companies that are mainly developing and managing security protocols for computer systems, software and hardware and devices.
