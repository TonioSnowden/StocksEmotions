  "title": "Cisco projects growth of 5% to 7% over next four fiscal years as software sales continue to climb",
  "text": "<p>“We are introducing new metrics because that's how investors need to think of us,” Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren told MarketWatch on the company's investor day Wednesday — its first in four years. He noted that 44% of Cisco's revenue this fiscal year came from subscriptions.</p><p>What is more, Cisco is revamping its current product categories, which are infrastructure platforms, applications and security, to five categories that better align with customer needs: secure, agile networks; hybrid work; end-to-end security; internet for the future; and optimized application experiences. The company will break out revenue for each in November.</p><p>“We have achieved metrics set four years ago, even through a pandemic,” said Herren, who added that investor day will return as an annual event.</p><p>Cisco's ongoing shift toward software and recurring revenue is the latest evidence of Chief Executive Chuck Robbins's overhaul of the Silicon Valley giant to a provider of hardware, software and subscription services as more companies demand hybrid-computing solutions.</p><p>Indeed, during investor day, Robbins focused on the company's $16 billion in annual software sales, making it one of the top software vendors in the world. “We were built for this moment,” he said.</p><p>“This is not a pivot. We have arrived and have delivered,” Robbins said. “And now we can continue to accelerate the software growth combined with world-class hardware.”</p><p>Cisco's four-year revenue forecast of 5% to 7% growth would far outstrip the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who expect it to crest at 6% in fiscal 2022 and then decelerate.</p><p>Cisco shares are up 29% so far in 2021; the broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 19% this year.</p>",
