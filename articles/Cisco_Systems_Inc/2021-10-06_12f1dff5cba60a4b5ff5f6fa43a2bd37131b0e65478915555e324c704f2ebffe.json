  "title": "Twin Health Gathers $140 Million to Tackle Metabolic Diseases; ‘Digital twin' technology could help patients overcome Type 2 diabetes",
  "text": "<p>Twin has collected clinical data showing its technology can help some people with Type 2 diabetes improve their health enough that they can stop taking diabetes medication. Patients get personalized recommendations in areas such as nutrition, sleep and activities through a Twin app.</p><p>In Type 2 diabetes, cells don't respond normally to insulin—a hormone that helps cells take up sugar from blood—while the pancreas doesn't produce sufficient insulin. High blood sugar is harmful and can lead to conditions including heart disease, vision loss and kidney disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Up to 95% of the more than 34 million Americans with diabetes have Type 2, according to the CDC. Patients can manage it through lifestyle changes, such as improving their diet and, when needed, medication.</p><p>Twin aims to help Type 2 diabetes patients reverse resistance in cells to insulin to allow blood sugar to fall into normal ranges. Its approach involves creating a digital twin, or digital replica, of a person's metabolism based on data from sources that include digital sensors and a patient's own preferences.</p><p>Digital-twin technology is beginning to be used in healthcare as more medical equipment is outfitted with digital technology, and as analytics and artificial intelligence enable better data analysis, said Alfonso Velosa, a vice president and analyst with Gartner Inc. The research company predicts that 25% of healthcare-delivery organizations world-wide will have a digital-twin initiative by 2025, up from less than 10% currently.</p><p>Initial healthcare applications include improved equipment tracking, but researchers also see potential to apply digital twins to areas such as heart-attack prevention, Mr. Velosa said.</p><p>Twin's system makes specific recommendations, such as exercise a person enjoys, and when to do it to address metabolic problems causing Type 2 diabetes. The company focuses on recommending activities patients like so they will be motivated to stay with the program, said Chief Executive Jahangir Mohammed, who sold Internet of Things platform company Jasper Technologies Inc. to Cisco Systems Inc. before launching Twin in 2018.</p><p>A blood test to check for Type 2 diabetes, HbA1c, measures the percentage of red blood cells that have sugar attached to the protein hemoglobin. An HbA1c reading below 5.7% is considered normal, while 5.7% to 6.4% is prediabetes and 6.5% or above indicates diabetes, according to the CDC.</p><p>An interim analysis of 33 of more than 200 people participating in a clinical study of Twin's service yielded promising results. Of the 33, 19 patients, or 57.6%, lowered their HbA1c to the 5.7% to 6.4% range, and 13, or 39.4%, lowered it below 5.7%, a complete remission of the disease. Ninety-two percent of patients in the interim analysis receiving Twin's service eliminated all diabetes medication, including insulin, and patients on average lost 20 pounds, the company said.</p><p>Patients in the control group, which only received their regular medical care, didn't achieve diabetes reversals, reduction in diabetes medications or significant improvement in weight or liver function, according to Twin.</p><p>The early data have been published in Diabetes, a journal of the American Diabetes Association. Twin also plans to publish further data from the study that also show benefits for patients, said Chief Medical Officer Lisa Shah.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is a sizable market, but Twin can also apply digital twin technology to many other chronic metabolic diseases, said Caroline Xie, a general partner with Iconiq Growth, an investor in the $140 million financing.</p><p>Other investors in the financing round included Sequoia Capital India, Perceptive Advisors, Corner Ventures, LTS Investments, Helena Special Investments and Sofina.</p><p>Twin, which also has operations in Chennai, India, has raised $186 million since its launch.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
