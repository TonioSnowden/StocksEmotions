  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 9 points, or 0.3%, at 3,948.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 13 points, or less than 0.1%, to 33,567.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP flipped between small gains and losses near 11,181.</p><p>Stocks finished lower on Wednesday for the second time in three sessions, with the S&amp;P 500 again failing to break above 4,000. The Dow fell 39 points, or 0.1%, to 33554, the S&amp;P 500 declined 33 points, or 0.8%, to 3959, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 175 points, or 1.5%, to 11184.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The Federal Reserve's benchmarkinterest rate will need to be increased further to a level high enough to bring inflation down, said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, on Thursday.</p><p>\"The change in the monetary policy stance appears to have had only limited effects on observed inflation, but market pricing suggests disinflation is expected in 2023,\" said Bullard, in a speech in Louisville, Ky.</p><p>While Bullard didn't explicitly say how high he thought the policy rate needed to go, a chart in his presentation suggested it could be somewhere around a 5%-7% range.</p><p>See: This is the chart that is rattling U.S. financial markets Thursday</p><p>Investors pay close attention to what Bullard says about markets since he's known for speaking his mind, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, said in a note to clients Thursday.</p><p>But it's possible he may have gone \"overboard\" by suggesting in a slide-show presentation that the Fed funds rate target may need to rise as high as 7%, Boockvar added. In any case, investors may be overreacting to his comments since Bullard won't have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee next year.</p><p>Fed funds futures traders are presently anticipating that the key benchmark rate will peak somewhere between 4.75% and 5.5% next spring.</p><p>Treasury yields shot higher on Thursday, with the yield on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up 7.4 basis points to 3.767%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y jumped to 4.475% from 4.363% on Wednesday.</p><p>If there's anything to be gleaned from public commentary unleashed by Bullard and other Fed officials this week, it's that \"a rate-hike pause may not be coming soon, and cuts definitely aren't coming soon unless something breaks,\" said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro.</p><p>Investment banks have been adjusting their expectations for where interest rates may peak next year, with Goldman Sachs Group GS calling for the Fed funds rate to peak at 5.25%. Also, Wednesday's stronger-than-expected retail sales number helped stoke fears that the Fed may need to be even more aggressive, diminishing hopes for a dovish pivot, as Deutsche Bank' Jim Reid said.</p><p>It also could be a reason why momentum that had carried the S&amp;P 500 to its highest level since mid-September has dissipated this week as the large-cap index has failed to close above 4,000.</p><p>\"After a strong rebound over recent days, the momentum behind risk assets [has] started to peter out…thanks to some hawkish comments from Fed officials, weak corporate earnings, as well as strong retail sales numbers that dampened hopes about a dovish pivot from the Fed,\" said Reid at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>A spate of U.S. economic data was released early Thursday, including housing startsdata, which showed that new-home construction has slowed, jobless claims data showing the number of Americans applying for benefits fell slightly, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said Thursday that its gauge of regional business activity sank to negative 19.4 in November from negative 8.7 in the prior month.</p><p>Aside from Bullard, a host of senior Fed officials have already made public remarks on Thursday. Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson said that achieving low inflationwas a key for inclusive economic growth.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Macy's Inc. stock M jumped almost 15% after the department store chain beat consensus estimates for the third quarter and raised its full-year profit guidance.</p><p>* Kohl's Corp. KSS rose 3.3% after the department store chain reported fiscal third-quarter profit and revenue above expectations, but withdrew its full-year outlook citing \"significant\" macroeconomic headwinds and the unexpected transition of its chief executive officer.</p><p>* Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA jumped 7.8% higher after the companytopped adjusted earnings expectationsfor the latest quarter and said it was upsizing its buyback program.</p><p>* Nvidia Corp. NVDA shares ticked 0.3% lower after the chip maker said modified servers to China mostly made up for an expected $400 million shortfall due to a U.S. ban on certain tech sales, and announced it's making progress in helping customers reduce high inventories. Nvidia reported third-quarter net income of $680 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.46 billion, or 97 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>* Cisco Systems Inc.'s CSCO stock rose 4.5% after the networking-technology company delivered better-than-expected numberson the top and bottom line, and offered encouraging guidance.</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed reporting</p><p>Dow struggles for direction, stocks trim losses after Fed speaker suggests interest rates may top out higher</p>",
