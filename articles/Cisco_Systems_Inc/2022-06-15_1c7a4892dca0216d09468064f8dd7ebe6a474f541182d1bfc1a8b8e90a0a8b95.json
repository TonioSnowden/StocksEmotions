  "text": "<p>State Rep. Russell Fry, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump, defeated Rep. Tom Rice (R., S.C.) in a closely watched GOP primary contest. Mr. Trump had endorsed Mr. Fry after Mr. Rice voted to impeach Mr. Trump for his role in the effort by his supporters to stop the certification of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021, which led to a riot at the Capitol.</p><p>Republicans were expected to hold the deeply conservative coastal district no matter which man had won the seat, but it garnered national attention for being the first race where a Trump-endorsed candidate faced off against one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump.</p><p>Elsewhere in the state, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace won her primary challenge against former state lawmaker Katie Arrington, who had earned Mr. Trump's endorsement. Ms. Mace criticized Mr. Trump's actions on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Ms. Mace, who beat a Democrat in the district in 2020, gave a pragmatic pitch to GOP voters: She said she was the only candidate who could keep the competitive seat in the Republican column this fall.</p><p>Tuesday also hosted a competitive special election in Texas' 34th Congressional District to fill the seat of Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela who left Congress in the spring. The district, in the state's heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley, is a top target of Republicans as Hispanic voters have shifted away from Democrats nationwide, including in Texas. Respiratory care practitioner Mayra Flores, a Republican, defeated former Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat, in a district President Biden carried by 4 percentage points in 2020. The victory may be short-lived, as there will be another election for next year under the new redistricting map.</p><p>Democrats nationwide are expected to face headwinds in holding on to their seats in November, as they try to separate themselves from President Biden's low poll numbers amid record inflation.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are you watching for in today's primaries? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Their ability to do so was tested in Nevada, a state expected to be one of the top political battlegrounds in November. Voters there selected Republican candidates to run against some of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country, including Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Gov. Steve Sisolak. Neither faced serious primary challenges.</p><p>Former state attorney general Adam Laxalt, a one-time Nevada campaign chair for Mr. Trump, will advance from the GOP primary to take on U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, according to projections by the Associated Press. The matchup is considered one of the top fights that will determine control of the U.S. Senate and Cook Political Report has called Ms. Cortez Masto the most endangered Democratic incumbent in the country.</p><p>In the race for governor, Trump-endorsed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo is leading in the GOP primary against former professional boxer Joey Gilbert and former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, according to early returns reported by the Associated Press.</p><p>With 57.6% of the expected vote counted, Mr. Lombardo had received 40.8% of the vote, with Mr. Gilbert trailing at 23.8% and Mr. Heller at 13.7%.</p><p>In November, the winner will face first-term Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, a top target for Republicans.</p><p>At a voting precinct in south Las Vegas, James Bell said he voted for the candidates backed by Mr. Trump as a way to protest Democratic control in the state and the nation. He said he doesn't recognize Joe Biden as the legitimate president of the U.S. </p><p>James Bell, in gray shirt, says he voted for Trumped-backed GOP candidates in Nevada.

Martin Middle School under blustery skies Tuesday morning. \"Trump did us good.\"</p><p>Teddie Pahl said she and her husband Richard voted at the same precinct for Mr. Lombardo in the gubernatorial race because of his leadership following the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which more than 50 people died.</p><p>\"We were not voting for a Trump election candidate, we voted for the candidates we know,\" Ms. Pahl said.</p><p>In the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Jeff McKenzie said he voted for Mr. Laxalt in the Senate race, but chose Mr. Heller for governor despite Mr. Trump's endorsement of the sheriff.</p><p>\"Even though Trump puts his name for somebody, it doesn't mean I'm going to vote for them,\" said Mr. McKenzie, a middle-school facilities manager.</p><p>\"He just has done a lot in this state,\" he said of Mr. Heller.</p><p>Former state legislator Jim Marchant made it past a crowded field of GOP candidates for Secretary of State, according to an AP projection, and will compete in the November election against Democrat Cisco Aguilar, who ran unopposed.</p><p>Outgoing Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, received a censure from the state GOP after repeatedly saying she found no evidence of widespread fraud behind Mr. Biden's 2020 win in Nevada. Mr. Marchant has said he would not have certified Mr. Biden's win in Nevada had he been secretary of state in 2020 and has said if elected he would be open to sending an alternative slate of electors to Congress to vote against Mr. Biden if the president wins re-election in 2024.</p><p>There are also three House races in the Las Vegas area where Democrats will be on defense in November. Two of those have competitive GOP primaries to find the Republican nominee.</p><p>Three Republicans are fighting over the nomination in Nevada's First Congressional District: retired Army colonel Mark Robertson, Carolina Serrano, who led the state's Latinos for Trump, and activist David Brog. The GOP nominee will face off against Rep. Dina Titus.</p><p>In Nevada's Fourth Congressional District, Democrat Rep. Steven Horsford is waiting to see which Republican he will be up against. Two top candidates are state Assemblywoman Annie Black—who attended the Jan. 6 rally but criticized those who went into the Capitol—and Sam Peters, a retired Air Force major.</p><p>Maine's Second Congressional District is another top target for Republicans to flip in November. Former Rep. Bruce Poliquin defeated Liz Caruso, a local official, in the GOP primary. He will get a rematch this fall against Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who beat Mr. Poliquin in 2018.</p><p>Jim Carlton in Las Vegas contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins+1@wsj.com. and Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com</p><p>S.C.
