  "text": "<p>Building diverse technology teams helped companies quickly develop new software apps and other services in response to changing markets and customer behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, chief information officers say.</p><p>By making IT jobs more accessible to a larger pool of applicants, whether by hiring workers from underrepresented groups, relaxing rigid qualifications or searching farther afield for global talent, corporate technology leaders were able to tackle a wider range of issues from different perspectives with fresh input, they say.</p><p>\"I've always been a big believer in borderless talent,\" Jacqueline Guichelaar, senior vice president and CIO at Cisco Systems Inc., said Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's virtual CIO Network Summit. \"Now talent is everywhere,\" she said.</p><p>When the pandemic struck, Cisco saw some 140,000 employees pivot to remote work almost overnight, along with an army of call-center workers who had never done their jobs outside of a company office, Ms. Guichelaar said.</p><p>To manage its own remote workforce, Cisco developed a number of upgrades and integrations for Webex, its videoconferencing tool, that included new features such as real-time translation or background noise removal, she said. These features, in turn, were rolled out to the company's customers who were facing many of the same issues, she said.</p><p>Mike McNamara, executive vice president and CIO of Target Corp., said for some IT job posts the company scrapped a basic requirement for a four-year university degree. \"Technology has changed,\" Mr. McNamara said at Tuesday's event, adding that for some IT positions, \"you don't need a degree from Stanford anymore to do this job.\"</p><p>Led by demand from customers—and its employees own experience during shutdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions—Mr. McNamara said Target's IT team accelerated efforts to build out services like online ordering and curbside pickups. New services planned before the pandemic struck, including a pilot project to roll out food and groceries pickup kiosks in Minneapolis and Dallas, were expanded to include stores nationwide within 12 months, he said.</p><p>The personal experiences of both customers and workers drove these and other tech-enabled initiatives, he said, \"and that's where diversity comes in.\"</p><p>Safeguarding employees' welfare throughout the pandemic also helped drive innovation, by preventing current workers from burning out, said Linda Jojo, executive vice president of technology and chief digital officer at United Airlines Holdings Inc.</p><p>Despite all the attention around hybrid work, she said, \"the real key word is flexibility.\"</p><p>Ms. Jojo said that could mean letting workers take a day off for themselves after an especially hectic shift. At the height of the pandemic, she said, United Airlines had tech teams working late into the night reconfiguring software systems to handle sudden restrictions on international travel, among other issues. Making sure workers aren't burning out is crucial for retaining and attracting skilled workers, she said.</p><p>Many of these and other pandemic-era approaches to tech staffing are likely to remain long after the immediate health crisis is over—especially given a chronic shortage of tech talent, said Target's Mr. McNamara.</p><p>\"The job market is very tight, we're all against one another for the same talent pools,\" he said: \"I think this is a forever thing.\"</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p><p>CIOs Credit Diverse Tech Teams With Pandemic Innovation</p>",
