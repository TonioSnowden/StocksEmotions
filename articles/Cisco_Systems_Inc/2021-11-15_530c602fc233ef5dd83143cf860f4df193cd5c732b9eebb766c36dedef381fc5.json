  "text": "<p>A new peak in investor interest in cryptocurrencies has been reached with Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang<a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/11/paradigms-new-venture-fund/\"> raising $2.5bn for Paradigm One,</a> their first venture capital fund.</p> <p>The fund tops that of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, which earlier this year raised twice as much as it had hoped for in its new cryptocurrency fund, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36413e3e-7915-45c7-b4ce-ccbeac972c94\">bringing in $2.2bn</a>. At the time, it said it was the “largest crypto fund ever raised”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b07d9777-8ac7-47ac-a358-12924711f2c8\">Miles Kruppa in San Francisco reports</a> Paradigm's success in also raising twice what it targeted could stoke fears about a bubble in cryptocurrencies, especially in the niche corners of decentralised finance (DeFi) where the firm has made its name. </p> <p>Both VCs are focused on an expanding ecosystem of applications based on ethereum, the digital ledger that allows programmers to write contracts automatically executing functions such as money transfers. The programs run on what are known as tokens. Paradigm's founders said the world of token-based apps, sometimes referred to as Web3, still had more room to grow. </p> <p>Several so-called decentralised finance protocols backed by Paradigm, such as the token exchange Uniswap, have soared in value in the past year as more people move money away from the legacy financial system. In areas such as gaming and music, developers are also experimenting with new ways to distribute value to consumers using tokens.</p> <p>In other developments, today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/exchanges-trading-clearing\">FT Special Report </a>on Risk Management looks at how crypto is pressuring markets<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b7ff0cb-b695-485d-b6be-ef0c8c0edde0\"> into 24/7 trading</a>, while we also explore how cryptocurrency trading platforms<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b8e6d72-b1d2-435c-88c1-4611e3a98da5\"> masquerade as “exchanges”</a>, when, most of the time, they are actually brokers.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. China IPOs' seven-year ditch</strong><br>Funds raised by tech start-ups' public listings in mainland China are heading for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a9fdadb-2985-4c2b-a509-338145c89b6a\">first annual drop in seven years</a> as Beijing's crackdown on the sector sends investors in search of alternative markets. Tech IP0s have raised about $14bn in 2021, according to Dealogic, trailing last year's total by $2.3bn. A further drag on listings came on Sunday, when China's internet regulator released draft rules that would require companies listing in Hong Kong to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0eee3005-af97-47de-a68b-7c2ffcb433f9\">undergo a cyber security review. </a></p> <p><strong>2.

The murky world of online reputation management</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa7ee177-f5d8-485c-9701-7d13847ac5b9\">Alphaville's Jemima Kelly says</a> the ORM industry is currently raking it in. She examines the reputation of Pure Reputation which, since 2010, has “tailored solutions for&#xa0;<a href=\"https://purereputation.co.uk/personal-reputation-management\">individuals</a>, brands and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://purereputation.co.uk/company-reputation-management\">companies</a>&#xa0;who want to protect their name online”.</p> <p><strong>5.
