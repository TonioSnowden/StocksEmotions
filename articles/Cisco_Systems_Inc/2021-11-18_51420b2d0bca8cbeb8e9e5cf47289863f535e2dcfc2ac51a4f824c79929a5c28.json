  "text": "<p>Oil prices fell for a second day after reports that President Biden and Chinese premier Xi Jinping have discussed jointly releasing strategic reserves to increase supply and lower prices. Global benchmark Brent crude pulled back 0.9% and traded at $79.76 a barrel, falling below $80 for the first time since Oct. 1.</p><p>\"The story of the day of what's happening on the oil front,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. \"All eyes are currently on inflation, so every small step toward deceleration of inflation is highly regarded.\"</p><p>Stocks have wavered this week as earnings rolled in and concerns about consumer-price rises continued. Results have overall been strong, but some major companies such as Target have been hit by supply-chain snarls and rising costs. Despite this, major indexes are still hovering close to their record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 just 0.3% below.</p><p>\"We're in an uncomfortable period where inflation is affecting consumer sentiment,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. He expects this to be a short-term drag and for earnings growth to stay strong into next year.</p><p>Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com and retailers Macy's and Kohl's are scheduled to release earnings Thursday ahead of the opening bell in New York.</p><p>Technology firm Nvidia rose over 5% in out-of-hours trading after posting record quarterly revenue after markets closed. Cisco Systems slid more than 6% after the networking company gave forward earnings guidance that was below Wall Street's estimates and said it was affected by the semiconductor shortage.</p><p>Fresh data on jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a decline as employers hang onto their workers in the tight labor market.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.580% from 1.604% on Wednesday. Prices rise when yields fall.</p><p>Bitcoin traded around $59,600, extending its fall into a fourth day. It is down another 0.8% from its level on Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk.</p><p>Overseas, the Turkish lira depreciated for an eighth consecutive day, reaching a record low of 10.8 lira to $1. The country's central bank will put out an interest rate decision Thursday and analysts are expecting another cut after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his calls for one, despite surging inflation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index was relatively flat. Shares of Thyssenkrupp climbed 6% after the industrial conglomerate said its earnings were boosted by the rise in steel prices. German car parts manufacturer Continental declined 5% after its board fired its chief financial officer.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3%, dragged down by a series of Chinese technology companies missing earnings expectations, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>China Evergrande Group said it planned to sell its stake in a Hong Kong-listed film production company, its latest move to generate cash to pay off its debts. It will incur a loss equivalent to around $1.1 billion from the transaction.
