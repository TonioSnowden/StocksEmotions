And the U.S. stock benchmark's 33% drop around the second Iraq war in 2003 came as “investors were also wrestling with the aftermath of the Tech bubble, as well as the accounting scandals that marked the early 2000s,” they said.“On Russia/Ukraine, there's no past conflict that provides a good template for how low stocks could trade if an invasion occurs,” RBC analysts led by Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy, said in a research note Monday. “But we have found it interesting that stock market declines around the two Iraq wars were similar to the kinds of drops we see around recessions” and growth scares.</p><p>Read:What a Russian invasion of Ukraine would mean for markets as Biden warns Putin of ‘severe costs'</p><p>In central bank developments, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated his call for the Fed to “front load” rate increases in the face of persistently high inflation.
