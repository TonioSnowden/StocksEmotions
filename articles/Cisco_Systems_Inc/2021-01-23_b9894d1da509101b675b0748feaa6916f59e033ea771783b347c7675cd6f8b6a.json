Will It  Keep  Winning?  ---  While American democracy  struggled to cope with the pandemic,  economic crisis and political  unrest, Chinese authoritarianism  could point to notable successes --  and rising international clout.  ----  By Greg Ip",
  "text": "<p>   In late 2019, a group of international public health experts set out to assess pandemic preparedness around the world. Using criteria such as early virus detection, speed of response and adherence to international health norms, they ranked the U.S. first, China a distant fifty-first. </p><p>   The experience with Covid-19, which swept the world shortly after that ranking was published, suggests that the experts got it backward. Among major countries, the U.S. has one of the highest per capita death tolls, China the lowest. The pandemic continues to spread in the U.S. while it remains mostly under control in China except for localized outbreaks. </p><p>   Covid-19 wasn't the only area in which China outshone the U.S. in 2020. Its economy managed to grow while the American economy shrank. Its political system grew stronger as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reasserted control over Hong Kong and China's unruly private sector. Meanwhile, American democracy took a hit as outgoing President Donald Trump sought to overturn last fall's election, culminating with a group of his followers violently storming the Capitol. Joe Biden took the oath of office this week behind military-style fortifications guarded by troops. </p><p>   If the U.S. and China are strategic competitors, as both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden maintain, then judging by the last 12 months, China is winning. Its centralized, authoritarian model has been ruthlessly efficient at mobilizing individuals, companies and government to combat Covid-19, face down foreign adversaries and deepen its technological know-how in areas such as semiconductors. U.S. efforts over the past year, by contrast, have been repeatedly undermined by the collision of interests within its pluralistic, decentralized system and among its fellow democracies. </p><p>   The U.S. has successfully adapted to internal and external challenges for over two centuries, and it would be unwise to count it out now. Yet the past year poses uncomfortable questions about whether the American system can meet the challenge of China. </p><p>   The rankings in the Global Health Security Index made intuitive sense. The U.S. had world-respected institutions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, top-ranked hospitals, doctors and public health systems, and wealth. China had a worrisome record on outbreaks like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, and though it had since invested heavily in its health care system, many of its people still lacked access to affordable, high-quality care. </p><p>   Yet Covid-19 was unlike any previous pandemic. It required the nationwide mobilization of medical, scientific and economic resources and the elevation of collective welfare over individual rights -- moves that came much more easily to China's authoritarian system. After initially trying to cover up the outbreak, Beijing imposed an unprecedented lockdown on nearly 60 million people. Residents of apartment blocks had to pass through guarded check points while neighborhood committees, who once watched for ideological transgressions under Mao Zedong, monitored compliance with health guidelines. The country used its formidable digital surveillance apparatus to find and quarantine infected people, using rail ticket purchases and cellphone location data to track down anyone who had passed through a hot spot. </p><p>   Andrew Batson, head of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research service, says that the country has traditionally been good at \"campaign-style\" governance: \"Local officials in China are really accustomed to being told, 'OK, drop whatever you were doing yesterday and switch everything to this today.'\" Government has become more repressive and less tolerant of dissent under Mr. Xi. Yet public administration has generally become more competent and less corrupt, Mr. Batson says. Invasive as China's measures were, ordinary Chinese appear to have accepted their necessity. </p><p>   In the U.S., by contrast, individual rights are not so easily overridden. Governors who favored lockdowns and mask mandates often clashed with advocates of economic freedom, including Mr. Trump and the courts. \"No individual in the history of this state has ever been vested with as much concentrated and standardless power to regulate the lives of our people,\" Michigan Supreme Court Judge Stephen Markman wrote in October, ruling that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's Covid-19 restrictions had exceeded her authority. \"There must now be some rudimentary return to normalcy.\" </p><p>   Of course, the absence of democratic constraints can only explain part of China's success. Taiwan, which is culturally similar but boisterously democratic, performed even better. And Britain's record against Covid-19 is as bad as that of the U.S., despite a centralized response including lockdowns and mask requirements. </p><p>   Still, the U.S. stood out for its lack of national leadership, says Petros Karakousis, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who studied how the global health security index got it so wrong. Mr. Trump left testing, supply procurement and other duties up to the states, an approach that Mr. Biden seeks to reverse. The advice of experts like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, was often sidelined by state and local governments and by Mr. Trump. \"It is intrinsic to the U.S. system that it's decentralized, making it difficult to impose these national mandates,\" Dr. Karakousis says. \"It didn't help [that] there wasn't support at the top for Fauci's message.\" </p><p>   Economic competition between the U.S. and China concerns not just the size and growth of gross domestic product but also who sets the standards for trade and technology. By those criteria, China proved remarkably resilient in 2020. It emerged from its trade war with the U.S. with a larger overall trade surplus, while the U.S. saw its trade deficit grow. And despite American efforts to curb Huawei Technologies Co., its share of global telecom shipments actually grew. </p><p>   For years China has used subsidies and protection to pursue self-sufficiency in technology. The U.S. assault on Huawei boosted that strategy. Chinese companies, long reluctant to use inferior domestic semiconductor suppliers, became less reluctant when they saw what happened to Huawei. Capital and talent poured into Chinese semiconductor startups. </p><p>   As for American companies, despite growing dissatisfaction with coerced technology transfer and discriminatory treatment, abandoning China's market remains unthinkable. Surveys last year show 87% of U.S. and 89% of European businesses had no plans to shift any operations out of China. </p><p>   U.S. efforts to counter Chinese industrial policy with its own have repeatedly stumbled over the refusal of American companies, customers and courts to go along. Without an American competitor to Huawei, the Trump administration at one point urged the networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. to take a stake in Finland's Nokia Corp. or Sweden's Ericsson AB. Cisco demurred because the business wasn't profitable enough, the Journal has reported. Meanwhile, as Congress moves closer to offering subsidies for U.S. semiconductor chip manufacturing, the leading U.S. player, Intel Corp., plans to outsource some chip making while investing in Chinese chip startups. </p><p>   Just as the self-interest of American companies has frustrated a unified American approach to China, so has the self-interest of other countries undermined a unified Western approach. Last year Australia asked the World Health Organization to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. This angered China, which has cast doubt on the virus's origins in China, and it retaliated by curbing imports of beef, wine and coal from Australia. </p><p>   How did other countries respond? Producers of beef in Argentina, wine in Chile and coal in Canada all hope to boost sales to China. \"If you are a producer of non-Australian coal and you are able to free up tons from other customers and contractual commitments, you can do quite well by selling to China,\" Don Lindsay, chief executive of Canada's Teck Resources Ltd., told an investor conference in December. </p><p>   The ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu once advised subduing the enemy without fighting, notes Clyde Prestowitz, a longtime critic of Japan's and now China's industrial policies. In his new book, \"The World Turned Upside Down: America, China, and the Struggle for Global Leadership,\" he writes that \"virtually any economic tie with China can be turned by Beijing into a tool for gaining policy influence -- without an open declaration or directive.\" </p><p>   China has actually strengthened its formal trade ties, joining the 15-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Though a relatively loose group, it's in keeping with China's use of global institutions and linkages to both expand markets and deter economic encirclement. \"In the age of globalization, the interests of all countries are so intertwined that the overwhelming majority of them do not want to take sides, let alone being forced into confrontation with China,\" foreign minister Wang Yi said last month. In an article last October, Mr. Xi said that China needed to \"increase global supply chains' dependence on China, which can counter and deter any forced cutoff in supply by outsiders.\" </p><p>   Mr. Biden hopes to draw American allies into a united front for dealing with China by abandoning Mr. Trump's belligerent behavior toward them, such as imposing steel tariffs. Yet it's not clear that allies are interested. Late last month the European Union struck an investment treaty securing better access for its companies to China, rebuffing a suggestion from Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden's incoming national security adviser, that it hold off. </p><p></p>",
