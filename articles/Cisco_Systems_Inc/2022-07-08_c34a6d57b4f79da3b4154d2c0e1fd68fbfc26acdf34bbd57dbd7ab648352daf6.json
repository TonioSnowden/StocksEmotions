  "text": "<p>From 2019 through the 2021 tax return that isn't final yet, the AbbVie parent company recorded $28.8 billion in taxable income, according to the report. Almost all of that came from foreign subsidiaries, except for less than $1 billion.</p><p>That structure means that AbbVie's Humira profits, even those generated from sales in the U.S., typically face the 10.5% minimum tax on foreign earnings, not the 21% domestic tax rate. As a result of those rules and other breaks, the company has been able to sometimes post single-digit tax rates, the report said.</p><p>\"While Big Pharma's game playing to avoid paying taxes is no secret, the scope of AbbVie's tax avoidance is eye popping. We haven't seen the scale until now,\" said committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who is conducting similar inquiries into other pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>AbbVie didn't provide a comment in response to the report.</p><p>The report criticizes the 2017 Republican tax law, which created that 10.5% minimum tax and ended a system in which companies could pay almost no taxes on foreign earnings until they brought profits home.</p><p>The report aims to bolster the case for U.S. tax changes to implement a global agreement for a 15% minimum tax, narrowing the gap between domestic and foreign profits. Many Democrats, including Mr. Wyden, want to impose that 15% minimum in each country where a company operates. That feature was included in a bill passed by the House last year, but it could be changed during negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and pivotal vote Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.).</p><p>Since the 2017 tax law was enacted, U.S. companies have slightly reduced profit shifting, said Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. According to a paper coauthored by Mr. Zucman, that reduction in profit shifting out of the U.S. was largely attributable to intellectual-property moves made by six large companies: Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Qualcomm Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Nike Inc.</p><p>The 2017 law created incentives for such companies to record their profits from foreign sales in the U.S. instead of booking foreign profits abroad.</p><p>But that hasn't been as true in the pharmaceutical industry, where companies have long served the U.S. market from low-tax foreign jurisdictions where drug patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are often held.</p><p>---</p><p>Jared Hopkins contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
