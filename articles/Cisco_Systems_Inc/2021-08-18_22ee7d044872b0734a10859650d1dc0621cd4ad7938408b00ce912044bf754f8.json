Fed officials are nearing consensus on beginning totaper bond purchases in about three months, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The Fed's bond-buying program and lower interest rates have helped the stock market power higher, with major indexes notching records earlier this week.</p><p>\"As long as policy remains reasonably supportive, growth continues and we keep increasing our vaccination, it is a strange environment where conditions are good for equities,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"There is genuine economic strength.\"</p><p>Investors also don't have many alternatives to putting money into stocks, according to Mr. Kamal. Markets aren't sure what direction to go in, and the Fed minutes will offer some crucial insights into policy makers' futures steps, he said. \"The Fed has shown they are really scared of upsetting the market,\" Mr. Kamal said.</p><p>Money managers say they expect that markets may waver as investors weigh increasing cases of Covid-19 and the Delta variant against positive factors such as a strong earnings season and stimulus measures. Fresh data on Tuesday showed that spending at U.S. retailers fell sharplyin July as Americans cut back on purchases of goods.</p><p>\"Markets are kind of stuck in this rangebound territory because they are dampened by recent economic data,\" said Charles Hepworth, an investment director at GAM Investments. \"The stimulus that has pushed all risk assets higher is still there. There is still this support behind it, so I can't see that we're going to see a serious correction on the cards.\"</p><p>Among individual stocks, Lowe's jumped 10%, heading for its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 2020, after raising its sales forecast for the year.
