  "text": "<p>Stocks have wavered this week as earnings rolled in and concerns about consumer-price rises continued. Results have overall been strong, but some major companies such as Target have been hit by supply-chain snarls and rising costs. Despite this, major indexes are still hovering close to their record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 just 0.3% below.</p><p>\"We're in an uncomfortable period where inflation is affecting consumer sentiment,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. He expects this to be a short-term drag and for earnings growth to stay strong into next year.</p><p>Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com and retailers Macy's and Kohl's are scheduled to release earnings Thursday ahead of the opening bell in New York.</p><p>Technology firm Nvidia rose nearly 7% in premarket trading after posting record quarterly revenue. Cisco Systems slid more than 6% after the company gave forward earnings guidance that was below Wall Street's estimates and said it was affected by the semiconductor shortage.</p><p>Data on jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a decline as employers hang onto their workers in the tight labor market.</p><p>Oil prices fell for a second day, before edging up slightly, after reports that President Biden and Chinese premier Xi Jinping had discussed jointly releasing strategic reserves to increase supply and lower prices. Global benchmark Brent crude briefly slipped below $80 a barrel for the first time since Oct. 1.</p><p>Bitcoin traded around $59,750, extending its fall into a fourth day. It is down another 0.6% from its level on Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk.</p><p>Overseas, the Turkish lira has depreciated for eight consecutive days, reaching a record low of 10.7 lira to $1. The country's central bank cut its key policy rate to 15% after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his calls for reduction, despite surging inflation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index ticked down 0.1%. Shares of Thyssenkrupp climbed 5.4% after the industrial conglomerate said its earnings were boosted by the rise in steel prices. German car parts manufacturer Continental declined 4.3% after its board fired its chief financial officer.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3%, dragged down by a series of Chinese technology companies missing earnings expectations, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>China Evergrande Group said it planned to sell its stake in a Hong Kong-listed film production company, its latest move to generate cash to pay off its debts. It will incur a loss equivalent to around $1.1 billion from the transaction. Evergrande's shares declined close to 6%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Gain Ahead of Earnings From Macy's and Kohl's</p>",
