  "title": "SoftBank Extends Second Vision Fund Investment Spree With Whatfix Deal; Whatfix is the latest in a steady stream of tech companies that have landed backing from SoftBank's second Vision Fund this year",
  "text": "<p>Whatfix traces its roots to a software tool designed in India to help small and medium-size businesses enhance their online presence through better search engine optimization, according to Mr. Batti.</p><p>However, he added that he and co-founder Vara Kumar quickly saw more promise in helping companies with software adoption across a range of different websites and digital platforms, and by 2014 they officially launched Whatfix to focus on it.</p><p>The company received $32 million in a Series C investment round in early 2020 led by Sequoia Capital India . Sequoia is also participating in the latest round, along with existing backers that include Eight Roads Ventures, Dragoneer Investment Group, F-Prime Capital and Cisco Investments, according to a news release.</p><p>Mr. Batti said the company plans to use the new investment partly for product development as more of its customers expand their use of the company's technology across multiple software applications.</p><p>Whatfix serves about 500 customers globally with about 75% of them in the U.S. and 18% in Europe. Whatfix users include The Netherlands Red Cross, Experian PLC , Sentry Financial Services, Cardinal Health Canada Inc., BMC Software Inc . and Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc .</p><p>Whatfix is the latest in a line of late-stage investments SoftBank has made in Indian startups this year. The Japanese conglomerate has already deployed at least $2 billion across as many as nine startups in India so far this year, said Sumer Juneja, partner and head of India at SoftBank Investment Advisers. Others include banking technology company Zeta Services Inc., which secured a $250 million investment from Vision Fund 2 in May. Social commerce app Meesho, which is run by Fashnear Technologies Pvt. Ltd., raised a $300 million round led by the fund earlier this year, according to media reports.</p><p>\"What we have seen is a large wave of successful [software-as-a-service] companies coming out of India,\" Mr. Juneja said. \"They are based between [Silicon] Valley and India and they sell into the U.S., but the R&amp;D comes out of India.\"</p><p>Whatfix has offices around the world, including in Bengaluru, India, and San Jose, Calif.</p><p>SoftBank has been actively investing its second Vision fund outside of India as well. Late last month, the firm led a $775 million Series A investment in direct-to-consumer merchandising company Whele LLC, which operates as Perch, through its Vision Fund 2, and $500 million in digital analytics technology provider  Contentsquare. In April, the firm led a $500 million round for mortgage lender  Better Holdco Inc.</p><p>SoftBank increased the size  of its second Vision Fund, which is funded entirely by the Japanese conglomerate, to $30 billion, sister publication Barron's reported earlier this year.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
