  "text": "<p>Futures for the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.1% Wednesday. The broad market index rose Tuesday, leaving it just short of last week's closing high, after a consumer-spending report raised hopes for the holiday-sales season. Contracts for the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were each up 0.1% Wednesday.</p><p>A strong earnings season has propelled stocks to fresh highs in recent weeks, offsetting investors' concerns that supply-chain issues and higher-than-anticipated inflation would weigh on profits. Cisco Systems, Bath &amp; Body Works and Nvidia are slated to release earnings after the market closes. Low returns on government bonds have also driven investors to buy stocks.</p><p>\"Equities are incrementally earning significantly more than bonds,\" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Brooks Macdonald. \"There is still a fear of missing out in markets at the moment driven by that relative valuation.\"</p><p>Shares of Tesla rose 1.4% in premarket trading. Chief executive Elon Musk sold another 934,000 shares Tuesday for roughly $973 million, continuing a recent selling spree, forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.</p><p>La-Z-Boy shares gained 3.9% premarket after the furniture maker said its fiscal second-quarter sales hit a record high, with the company able to increase its capacity to meet heightened demand.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.625% Wednesday from 1.632% Tuesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value edged down 1.9% from its 5 p.m. ET level Tuesday to $59,435.94 Wednesday. The move adds to a recent decline as the cryptocurrency has come off record highs.</p><p>Home builders have been caught between strong demand for housing, and rising material costs and supply and labor shortages. That has left new-home construction data choppy in recent months, though economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a slight pickup in housing starts for October when figures are released at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%. In Asia, major stock indexes closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 shed 0.4%. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Muted Ahead of Target, Lowe's Earnings</p>",
