  "text": "<p>WeWork executives say Workplace will help businesses lure workers back to offices by giving their employees an app with which they can do such things as book a conference room, post a company announcement or register for a yoga class.</p><p>\"Companies of all sizes recognize that people aren't coming in every day,\" said Scott Morey, WeWork's president of technology and innovation. That change in the workplace created challenges that require digital solutions, he said.</p><p>But WeWork isn't alone in looking for new business opportunities in the upheaval in the office-space industry caused by the pandemic. Competitors offering apps, data, telecommunications and other software include technology companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Honeywell International Inc.</p><p>Cisco is trying to tap into this demand with services including its teleconferencing system that cancels background sounds and a space-management tool that tracks employee usage of conference rooms and other office space.</p><p>Honeywell has tried to capture market share with software such as People Counting, which analyzes video from security cameras to keep a real-time log of how many people go in and out of the office.</p><p>The size of the office-software business is difficult to gauge partly because it is so young, but participants estimate that it is in the billions of dollars.</p><p>WeWork's rollout of its workplace-software service marks the latest chapter in the saga of the company. WeWork shook up the office-space business in the years leading up to the pandemic, but a planned initial public offering in 2019 flopped. Since then, new management cut costs by shedding leases. Last October, WeWork went public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.</p><p>But its stock, which hit a high of $13.18 in October, has fallen to under $5 a share partly because the company continues to operate at a loss and is still on the hook for a $2.4 billion load of debt, due in 2025, analysts say.</p><p>Some analysts don't expect WeWork's new workplace-software offering to be much help.</p><p>\"It seems to be a diversion, more than anything else, away from what is a bad business model,\" said David Trainer, chief executive of investment-research firm New Constructs.</p><p>But Piper Sandler's senior real-estate-investment-trust analyst, Alexander Goldfarb, predicted that boosting building occupancy with new ventures such as WeWork Workplace and cutting cost margins help put WeWork on track to achieve positive cash flow in 2024.</p><p>\"WeWork is a great outfit for companies looking for flexibility and small businesses to have, especially when you're trying to figure out what your office needs,\" Mr. Goldfarb said.</p>",
