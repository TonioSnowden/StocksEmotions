  "title": "U.S. Sees New Bright Spot in Europe: Greece; American tech companies, gas exporters and military expand activity in Greece, whose long-suffering economy bounces back",
  "text": "<p>Liquefied natural gas shipped from the U.S. unloads at giant new storage tanks near Athens. High-tech U.S. companies including Microsoft Corp., Pfizer Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. over the past three years have opened or announced local investments, entering a market long overlooked by corporate America.</p><p>Meanwhile, as U.S. relations with Turkey have soured, Greece has become the Pentagon's new hub for moving troops through the Balkan and Black Sea regions. Athens and Washington in October expanded their mutual-defense agreement to make the pact open-ended, ending a longstanding requirement of annual renewal.</p><p>The warming ties are notable because they began about five years ago under a far-left-led Greek coalition and have accelerated under the current center-right government. In the U.S., Greece has won bipartisan support through the Biden, Trump and Obama administrations.</p><p>Today, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis backs U.S. positions on Russia, tipping away from Athens' longstanding openness to Moscow, and has made Greece less welcoming to Chinese business. The U.S.-educated Mr. Mitsotakis is also helping Washington's drive for stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region by strengthening links with Israel, Egypt, Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>On Wednesday, Congress approved bipartisan legislation to boost U.S. support for Greece's military modernization and its security role in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>\"Greece's partnership with the United States has never felt stronger, more important or more relevant than it is today,\" Mr. Mitsotakis told The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Before Mr. Mitsotakis took office in 2019, his predecessor, Alexis Tsipras, occasionally infuriated Washington and European allies by supporting China and Russia in international disputes. Hungry for investment, Athens sold major port facilities to Chinese and Russia-linked investors.</p><p>Now, Greece's diplomatic stature is rising as its battered economy recovers from the Covid-19 crisis, although it remains among the European Union's weakest. It is reliant on seasonal tourism—which included a flood of Americans this summer—and it is surrounded by troubled countries. Meanwhile, neighbors such as Turkey, and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies including the U.K., Poland and Hungary, are pursuing policies that are sparking friction in Europe and with many Americans.</p><p>Greece is \"certainly a bright spot for U.S.-European relations,\" said U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt. \"We've got an alignment of interests and a government that's focused on relations with the U.S.\"</p><p>Not all Greeks support the realignment. George Katrougalos, who previously served as foreign minister, said Mr. Mitsotakis had shed Greece's longstanding policy of balanced relations with Moscow to become the \"last outpost of the West\" in the region, which he considers an outdated concept. Still, Mr. Katrougalos believes that Greece and the U.S. share common interests in stabilizing the region politically.</p><p>For years, Greeks viewed Washington warily due to its support for a military coup in 1967 and its lack of overt support for Greece in its frequent spats with Turkey. Views began changing around a decade ago, when the Obama administration devoted enormous effort to keep Greece in the eurozone and championed its cause in debt negotiations.</p><p>The rapprochement built on a natural affinity: As many as three million Americans are of Greek descent and countless Greeks have links to the U.S. But institutional ties had atrophied.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Pyatt arrived in July 2016, he visited the northeastern port of Thessaloniki, a city with historic ties to Russia, where local officials and military leaders told him they felt the U.S. had \"checked out.\" Mr. Pyatt, who had just served as ambassador to Ukraine and watched Russia annex Crimea, said he returned to Athens determined never again to hear that the U.S. was invisible in Greece.</p><p>He decided the Thessaloniki International Fair of 2018 would become a showpiece for high-tech U.S. companies. In Greece's small-scale international business community, the fair is a big event, where China and Russia also strut. Then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross helped inaugurate the U.S. pavilion, which was the largest in years and the same size as China's.</p><p>At the same fair one year later, Pfizer—led by Greek-American Albert Bourla—announced plans for new digital labs in Thessaloniki, Mr. Bourla's hometown. Last year, Microsoft made an even bigger show of confidence in Greece by announcing plans for three new data centers to serve the broader region. Microsoft won't put a value on the investment, but local officials have said it is more than $100 million.</p><p>\"We took a bet, but we think it will be a very good bet,\" said Theodosis Michalopoulos, Microsoft's general manager for Greece, Cyprus and Malta.</p><p>Bureaucracy and outdated regulations have slowed work developing the data centers, which will take years, he said. \"It hasn't been easy, but we're getting through.\"</p><p>Since Microsoft's announcement, Cisco Systems Inc., Amazon Web Services and others have announced investments in research, training and data centers. The projects remain a tiny part of Greece's economy, but are helping raise the U.S.'s profile in the country.</p><p>\"They won't transform the Greek economy overnight, but it's laying the foundation,\" said Nikolaos Bakatselos, president of the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce in Athens, who sees big names attracting other large companies.</p><p>More immediately significant for Greece are U.S.-backed projects helping diversify its energy supply away from coal and Russian gas. Coastal gas-storage facilities and a new pipeline supplying gas from Azerbaijan—all developed with Washington's encouragement—are trimming Athens's energy dependence on Moscow. EU economic-recovery funding is now flowing to renewable energy projects.</p><p>\"Greece is arguably the single most important partner for the U.S. in Southeast Europe for energy security and diversification,\" said Mr. Pyatt.</p><p>A career Foreign Service officer who has served an unusually long term in Athens, Mr. Pyatt said Greek-U.S. relations offer a lesson as the Biden administration tries to re-engage on the world stage.</p><p>\"We have to use all of the U.S. government tool kit,\" he said of the multi-front push to parry rivals that had waded more deeply into local business and politics. \"You can't fight something with nothing.\"</p><p>Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Sees New Bright Spot in Europe: Greece</p>",
