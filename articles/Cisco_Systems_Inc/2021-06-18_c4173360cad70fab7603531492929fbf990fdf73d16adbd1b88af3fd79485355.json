  "text": "<p>There is no shortage of actors getting a shot at singing in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e66bcdb-d60c-4995-9d14-9f160a5aac4e\">Robert Altman</a>'s sprawling, messy 1975 movie <em>Nashville</em>. That is as you'd expect from a film set in Music City, where music and politics are intersecting during a fictional presidential campaign. </p> <p>None of the performances are bad —&#xa0;bar the ones that are meant to be —&#xa0;but one stands out. On stage at the Grand Ole Opry, the weekly concert that is to country music what Bayreuth is to Wagner, Karen Black, playing Connie White, approaches the mic in a red dress trimmed with sequins.</p> <p>The actress's voice is rich and velvety, her delivery languid and relaxed; she radiates charisma, controlling the stage like someone who had spent years working her way through the clubs to the theatres. Most surprising, though, is the fact that the songs she sings — “Memphis” and “I Don't Know If I Found It In You” (and, in a later scene, “Rolling Stone”) — were not written by professional writers. Black wrote her own songs, and they sound as though they could have come from a very good album.</p> <p>All this makes it less surprising that next month sees the release of <em>Dreaming of You</em> <em>(1971-76)</em>, a collection of recordings by Black, mostly with producers Bones Howe and Elliott Mazer. They were discovered after her death in 2013 by her fourth husband, Stephen Eckelberry, who hadn't known her in the 1970s, then compiled and prepared for release by Cass McCombs, a musician specialising in Americana. </p> <p>All bar a couple of the songs were written by Black, and all are very good: playful, largely acoustic and idiosyncratic. You wouldn't be in the least surprised to be told they were by some twenty-something bohemian “freak folk” artist.</p> <p>“She sang all the time at home,” Eckelberry says. “She loved singing. But it was kind of a push-me, pull-you. She wanted to sing, but she was really worried about the technical part of it. She didn't feel she had the command over it that she did over acting. So pushing past that slight reticence was part of her singing.” </p> <p>And she sang in public, too. She sings in several of her stellar run of films from the early 1970s: in a car, to Jack Nicholson, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzrPludfGwc\"><em>Five Easy Pieces</em></a>; duetting with Kris Kristofferson in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLpEWzm8vPs\"><em>Cisco Pike</em></a>; on the soundtrack, as she and George Segal sit on windswept beach in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNYRTf-QPbg\"><em>Born to Win</em></a>. She sang her own composition “Did You Ever Wonder?” on Dolly Parton's TV show in 1976, she sang in her one-woman stage show on the New York stage in 1982. Oddest of all, she sang Sonny Bono's “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI-RB9FDI3Q\">on a cable TV show</a> in 1997, backed by the punk band L7. </p> <p>All of which suggests someone willing to take on most challenges. “She was totally game for anything,” Eckelberry confirms. “She didn't think of herself this way, but I thought of her as fearless.”</p> <p>So why did those recordings from the '70s end up in a box in her house, rather than being hawked around record labels? Eckelberry points out that her scant recording sessions were just asides in the context of her career. “A session was just two or three days of her life. She was so busy, constantly working, that it was one of those things that slipped right by.”</p> <p>He notes also that she was always creating. Even after her acting career slipped from those '70s highs into a succession of B-movies and horror films, she was writing poetry and a musical. Some songs from decades earlier were simply not that important to her.</p> <p>McCombs met Black in 2009, and promptly roped her into singing with him on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5l8lqNakPI\">“Dreams Come True Girl”</a>. “We kept on getting together and coming up with new ways to collaborate,” he says. They recorded more —&#xa0;two new collaborations feature on a single that accompanies the album — and had been planning an album together when Black died. And then the tapes came to light.</p> <p>“I'm talking lots and lots of tapes,” McCombs says. “Not just reel-to-reel tapes, but different mediums — half inch, quarter inch, one inch. Shoeboxes and shoeboxes of cassette tapes. Crazy, totally undocumented. We didn't know what was on there. </p> <p>“On some she was studying for film roles. Some were recordings of her one-woman show, just live recordings. Others are of her practice tapes of musical ideas. And others are what ended up being the album, professional recordings she had done in the early '70s. She was a very, very creative person. It wasn't just music. One day I went over to her house, and she was like: “Sit down, Cass.” And she immediately had to draw a picture of me. She was always doing and being creative. She had a renaissance kind of mind.”</p> <p>There was very little information about the songs — the album credits note they come from “various recording sessions between 1971 and 1976” with “instrumentation by various session musicians” — but McCombs was struck by the quality of her writing, and by her voice. “She does it in a way that is still spontaneous, it's just erupting from her, from her soul. Her spirit just ejects from a real place. Certainly Karen was a great technical singer, but what makes her interesting is that it is completely herself.”</p> <p>What puzzles him is that the recordings could have languished so long. “It felt strange to me . . . that these songs didn't get released. Or even get close to be being released. They didn't even get to the next step, where you go back to the studio and you record with other musicians.”</p> <p>Listening to the tapes was an odd experience for Eckelberry too. He had not known Black when she made them — they married in 1987 —&#xa0;and now he was hearing something of his wife he had never known. </p> <p>“It was both familiar and a revelation at the same time,” he says. “It was Karen, and it was this young Karen I hadn't known. She was 40 when I met her but she always looked younger than her age. She was always playing people younger than she was. And she had a young-sounding voice. But boy, that youthful sweetness, it was astounding to hear that. It's very much a time capsule. Suddenly you are transported to the early '70s.”</p> <p>In her latter years, in those horror movies,&#xa0;Black became a cult figure. Once a figurehead of the New Hollywood, she had become the Queen of Horror. Younger creative types collaborated with her, and after her death the experimental hip-hop group Death Grips released footage of her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=susTeQpgR9k\">reading from a film script</a> called <em>Bottomless Pit</em> to preview an album of the same name. But these were all other people's projects. With the release of <em>Dreaming of You</em>, Black's real voice is finally heard again.</p> <p><em>‘Dreaming of You (1971-76)' is released on July 16 on Anthology Recordings. ‘Nashville' is back in UK cinemas from June 25</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Michael Hann 2021 'Actress Karen Black — the secret songwriter ' FT.com 18 June.
