  "text": "<p>Cisco&#xa0;CSCO reported net income of $2.97 billion, or 71 cents a share, compared with net income of $2.5 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The company's adjusted net income was $3.5 billion, or 84 cents a share, vs. $3.4 billion, or, 79 cents a share, a year ago.</p><p>Revenue improved 6% to $12.7 billion, from $12 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected earnings of 81 cents a share and revenue of $12.66 billion.</p><p>“We continue to see incredibly strong demand across our portfolio, emphasizing the criticality and relevance of Cisco's innovation,” Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a statement announcing the results. “Our robust order strength, record backlog and double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue position us well to deliver growth.”</p><p>The company expects 70 cents to 74 cents a share in profit, or 85 cents to 87 cents on an adjusted basis, in the fiscal third quarter. Analysts were forecasting 78 cents and 87 cents, respectively, according to FactSet.</p><p>Cisco reported sales of $9.35 billion for products and $3.37 billion for services during the quarter. Secure, Agile sales ($5.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year) and Internet for the Future ($1.32 billion, up 42%) led in revenue categories.</p><p>Cisco, like most major tech component suppliers, is coping with supply-chain issues that have partially offset strong enterprise sales. “Our business performed well with revenue and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% year over year despite the supply-constrained environment,” Cisco Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said in a statement.</p><p>Cisco's stock is down 14% so far in 2022, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average&#xa0;DJIA,&#xa0;&#xa0;which counts Cisco as a component, has declined 4%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX has dropped 6% this year.</p>",
