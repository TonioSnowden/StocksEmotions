The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Russia has filed a report with the United Nations alleging that Ukraine's military has committed “crimes” against residents of the eastern Donbas region.</p><p>“This is likely to be the bigger concern for NATO and the U.S., if separatist forces try and goad Ukrainian forces into a counter-response, thus creating an excuse for a Russian incursion, and for all hell to break loose,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.</p><p>“The bigger risk for markets is that President Putin simply leaves the bulk of his forces on the border and simply plays a game of cat and mouse for the next few weeks and months,” Hewson said.</p><p>President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday morning that a Russian invasion could happen in the next “several days.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressing the U.N.

Fed officials will have another round of inflation and employment data before making their decision next month.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Tesla Inc.TSLA fell 4.8% after news that U.S. highway safety authorities opened up an investigation into “phantom braking.”</p><p>Shares of Walmart Inc.WMT were in focus, rising 3.7% after reporting fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations and raising its dividend.</p><p>Palantir Technologies Inc.PLTRgrew revenue more quickly than anticipated in its latest quarter, though earnings per share fell short of expectations.
