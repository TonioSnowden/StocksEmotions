  "title": "Cisco Wins Appeal Of Patent Judgment",
  "text": "<p>The ruling is part of the continuing fallout from federal judges allegedly violating financial-conflict laws that have spread to appeals courts across the nation.</p><p>After a bench trial but before issuing an opinion, Judge Henry Morgan in Norfolk, Va., disclosed that he had learned that his wife held $4,700 of Cisco stock during the trial.</p><p>Centripetal Networks Inc., a Virginia cybersecurity company, had filed a patent-infringement case against Cisco. Originally, Centripetal raised no objection to the judge remaining on the case, but Cisco requested that Judge Morgan step aside.</p><p>At a hearing, the judge said he would direct his lawyer to place the shares in blind trust instead of asking his wife to sell them off. He said he worried that dumping the stock ahead of his opinion on the merits of the case could look bad if he ruled against Cisco.</p><p>The judge denied Cisco's recusal motion in October 2020 and soon found that the company infringed Centripetal's patents.</p>",
