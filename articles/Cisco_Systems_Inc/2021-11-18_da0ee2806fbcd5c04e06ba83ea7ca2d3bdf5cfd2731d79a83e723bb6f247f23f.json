  "title": "Stock Futures Gain After Earnings From Macy's and Kohl's; Major indexes hover close to record highs",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have wavered this week as earnings rolled in and concerns about consumer-price rises continued. Results have overall been strong, but some major companies such as Target have been hit by supply-chain snarls and rising costs. Despite this, major indexes are still hovering close to their record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 just 0.3% below.</p><p>\"We're in an uncomfortable period where inflation is affecting consumer sentiment,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. He expects this to be a short-term drag and for earnings growth to stay strong into next year.</p><p>Shares of Macy's surged more than 9% and Kohl's jumped over 8% premarket, as both retailers released earnings that beat analysts' estimates and raised their full-year guidance. Alibaba declined 6% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported a drop in quarterly profit due to losses from its investments in equities.</p><p>Technology firm Nvidia rose over 8% in premarket trading after posting record quarterly revenue. Cisco Systems slid 7% after the company gave forward earnings guidance that was below Wall Street's estimates and said it was affected by the semiconductor shortage.</p><p>Electric-vehicle makers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group extended losses into a second day premarket. The stocks were both down around 6%.</p><p>The latest data showed 268,000 people filed for jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 13, a decline from the previous week. The number of claims is beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels, as employers hang on to their workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>Bitcoin traded at around $59,950, extending its fall into a fourth day. It is down another 0.2% from its level on Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk.</p><p>Overseas, the Turkish lira has depreciated for eight consecutive days, reaching a record low of 11.1 lira to $1. The country's central bank cut its key policy rate to 15% Thursday after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his calls for reduction, despite surging inflation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index ticked down 0.2%. Shares of Thyssenkrupp climbed 6.4% after the industrial conglomerate said its earnings were boosted by the rise in steel prices. German car parts manufacturer Continental declined 3.1% after its board fired its chief financial officer.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3%, dragged down by a series of Chinese technology companies missing earnings expectations, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>China Evergrande Group said it planned to sell its stake in a Hong Kong-listed film production company, its latest move to generate cash to pay off its debts. It will incur a loss equivalent to around $1.1 billion from the transaction. Evergrande's shares declined close to 6%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Gain After Earnings From Macy's and Kohl's</p>",
