  "title": "Stock Futures, Bond Yields Swing on Fear of Ukraine War; Oil prices edge down after jumping on concern Russian crude supplies could be curtailed",
  "text": "<p>Yields on government bonds also bounced back, after falling as investors reached for the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes ticked up to 1.968% from 1.951% Friday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Overseas stock markets dropped, catching up with Wall Street's late-week tumble. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 1.9%, led lower by banks and travel and leisure companies. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 2.2% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 1%.</p><p>Oil prices edged down, after jumping on concern a war would curtail supplies of Russian crude amid a lack significant spare supplies. Brent, the benchmark in energy markets, fell 0.8% to $93.72 a barrel, holding near its highest level since 2014.</p><p>Prices for natural gas—of which Russia is the single biggest exporter globally—rose on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., gas prices rose 3.1% to $4.06 per million British thermal units. Prices in Europe, which depends on Russia for much of its gas, a chunk of it flowing through Ukraine, jumped 5%. Prices for palladium—a metal widely used in the auto industry and heavily produced in Russia—added 3.5%.</p><p>Stocks have been buffeted this year by the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. The central bank is gearing up to increase borrowing costs to combat the highest rate of inflation in four decades, winding down the easy-money policies that have pushed riskier assets higher for much of the past two years.</p><p>The possibility of a ground war in Europe has loomed as an additional source of uncertainty for investors. Moscow has denied intending to invade Ukraine, but Russia's military buildup has quickened, with forces positioned on three sides of the country.</p><p>In recent weeks, investors had wagered that war would be averted, piling into the ruble and hryvnia, as well as Russian and Ukrainian government bonds. Those assets were volatile Monday, initially selling off before clawing back some ground.</p><p>Russia's benchmark stock index, the Moex Russia, fell 1%. Ukraine's hryvnia weakened 1.7% to 28.55 a dollar. The yield on a dollar-denominated Russian government bond maturing in 2026 rose to 4.441% from 3.926% Friday, according to Tradeweb. A Ukrainian dollar bond maturing in 2033 traded at a yield of 10.798%, up from 10.222%.</p><p>Catching some investors off guard, the ruble strengthened 1.1% to 76.63 a dollar. Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said the move suggested Russia's central bank had intervened in foreign-exchange markets. \"On the geopolitical risk, the ruble should be weaker,\" he added.</p><p>Russia's central bank has ample reserves of foreign currency with which to support the ruble. The bank didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Investors say the standoff over Ukraine is difficult to trade. If Moscow were to attack and the U.S. and its allies responded with sanctions, the hostilities could affect the world economy and markets in unpredictable ways.</p><p>One likely consequence, given Russia's position as a commodities superpower, would be higher energy prices, which could keep up the pressure on central banks to raise rates. At least in the short term, stocks and bond yields would likely decline as investors sought safe assets, investors say.</p><p>\"We have the inflation story and then we have the Russian story,\" said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. In the event of an invasion, \"there will be some negative effect on markets, but I also think investors are incorporating this,\" he added.</p><p>Among individual U.S. stocks, Splunk rose 10% in premarket trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that Cisco Systems had made a takeover offer worth more than $20 billion for the software maker.</p><p>Shares of airlines were hammered in Europe after reports that several were avoiding Ukraine's airspace. Budget carrier Wizz Air dropped 7.6%, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group lost 5% and Deutsche Lufthansa fell 3.4%.</p><p>—Anna Hirtenstein and Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures, Bond Yields Swing on Fear of Ukraine War</p>",
