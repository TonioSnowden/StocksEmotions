  "text": "<p>Ethan Allen Interiors, a furniture company that definitely won't let you pay in bitcoin, has seen a surge of retail-investor interest recently. Its ticker symbol, ETH, is the same as the one used for red-hot ethereum. Message boards for the stock are mostly filled with banter about the cryptocurrency, not the company.</p><p>\"We've definitely seen a massive increase on a percentage basis in mistaken activity on the Ethan Allen stream,\" says Rishi Khanna, chief executive officer of social investing site Stocktwits.</p><p>The confusion persists despite ribbing by other posters. On Yahoo Finance, for example: \"$ETH to the moon! -- give us something to sit in when we get there!\" And: \"In the year 2030, all transactions will be settled digitally with Ethan Allen interiors stock.\"</p><p>With some novice investors buying first and asking questions later, it might even have spilled over into actual purchases. Turnover for Ethan Allen in the past month is 56% above its five-year average. That might not be a bad thing. Back in the dot-com boom, some investors allegedly bought \"the wrong Cisco,\" purchasing shares of food services company Sysco by mistake. Since March 2000, it has outperformed the once red-hot networking stock by 728 percentage points.</p>",
