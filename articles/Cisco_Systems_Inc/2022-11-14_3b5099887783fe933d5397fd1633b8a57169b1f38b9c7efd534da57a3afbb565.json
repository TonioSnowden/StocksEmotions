  "text": "<p>   Candidates who stated without evidence that the 2020 presidential election was rigged have lost secretary-of-state elections in four key battleground states. </p><p>   Voters in Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Minnesota rejected Republican candidates who said the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump and were also backed by Mr. Trump. </p><p>   The normally low-key races for offices that oversee elections turned into closely watched contests this year, with Democrats warning that candidates who questioned the 2020 election could jeopardize the integrity of the 2024 presidential election results. </p><p>   In Nevada, Democrat Cisco Aguilar defeated Jim Marchant, a former state assemblyman who backed false claims that the 2020 election results were fraudulent, the Associated Press said Saturday. </p><p>   Mr. Marchant made a similar unsubstantiated claim about his own unsuccessful race for a Las Vegas area congressional seat that year. </p><p>   \"We must continue to reject extremism and those who threaten our democracy,\" said Mr. Aguilar, an attorney who served on the state's Athletic Commission. </p><p>   In Arizona, Democrat Adrian Fontes defeated Mark Finchem, an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump and his unfounded claims about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, the Associated Press said Friday. </p><p>   Earlier this year, Mr. Finchem introduced a resolution to decertify and overturn 2020 election results in three of that state's counties, including Maricopa, home to Phoenix and a hub of support for Democrats including President Biden. </p><p>   On Saturday, Mr. Finchem said on Twitter that the election isn't over \"until the last legal vote is counted.\" </p><p>    In Michigan, Democratic secretary of state Jocelyn Benson defeated Kristina Karamo, and in Minnesota, Democratic incumbent Steve Simon defeated Kim Crockett. </p><p>   In Georgia, voters gave another term to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was sharply criticized by Mr. Trump after the 2020 election. </p><p>   Mr. Trump and others pressured him, unsuccessfully, to overturn Mr. Trump's narrow 2020 loss in the state. </p><p></p>",
