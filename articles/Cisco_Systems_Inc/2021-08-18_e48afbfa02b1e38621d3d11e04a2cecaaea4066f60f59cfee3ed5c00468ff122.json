  "text": "<p>Revenue rose 8% to $13.1 billion, from $12.15 billion a year ago.</p><p>“We continue to see great momentum in our business as customers are looking to modernize their organizations for agility and resiliency,” Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a statement announcing the results. He said product order growth of 31% was the best year-over-year in more than a decade.</p><p>Quarterly product sales ($9.72 billion) and service revenue ($3.4 billion) recorded year-over-year gains while Cisco reported minimal restructuring costs, allaying the concerns of some investors and employees.</p><p>As is usually the case with fourth-quarter results, murmurs of layoffs picked up in recent days, part of what one former Cisco employee sardonically referred to as the company's “summer tradition” of staff cutbacks after heavy M&amp;A activity and the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>In the same quarter a year ago, for example, Cisco announced CFO Kelly Kramer was retiring and said it would undergo a $1 billion cost reduction “over the next few quarters” by “rebalancing its R&amp;D investments” on several areas that included cloud security and automation in the enterprise.</p><p>From August 2020: Cisco's tepid earnings outlook, revenue decline and CFO retirement news hits stock</p><p>But that didn't happen this quarter, as Cisco — a bellwether for tech hardware demand in the industry — reported nearly $50 billion in fiscal-year revenue and offered first-quarter revenue growth guidance of between 7.5% and 9.5% — ahead of analysts' projections of 7.5%.</p><p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected earnings of 83 cents and revenue of $13 billion.</p><p>Cisco's stock is up 23% so far in 2021. The broader S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX&#xa0;has gained 17% this year.</p>",
