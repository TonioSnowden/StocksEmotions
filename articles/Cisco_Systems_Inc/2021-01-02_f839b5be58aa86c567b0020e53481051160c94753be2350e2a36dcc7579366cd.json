  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Jim Kavanaugh --- Chief Executive Officer, World Wide Technology",
  "text": "<p>Today, the WWT chief executive presides over a global enterprise with $13.4 billion in annual revenue and about 7,000 employees. It provides an array of high-tech services to companies, government agencies and others. And Mr. Kavanaugh now has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p><p>Mr. Kavanaugh had little sense of his full potential while growing up in St. Louis. As the son of a bricklayer and homemaker, \"I thought I would probably end up in construction,\" he says. He considered launching a landscaping business once he finished high school.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Kavanaugh won a soccer scholarship to Saint Louis University, where he majored in marketing. The Los Angeles Lazers, a team in the Major Indoor Soccer League, drafted him after his 1986 graduation.</p><p>Mr. Kavanaugh left in 1988 to be a sales manager at an electronics distributor. Technology looked like \"a growth area,\" he says.</p><p>Two years later, he teamed up with entrepreneur David Steward to found WWT. Mr. Steward provided seed money.</p><p>The startup struggled at first. Heating and trash bills went unpaid for months. But those days are behind him.</p><p>Mentors have helped Mr. Kavanaugh handle challenges, letting him know he could succeed \"if I have the grit and determination to overcome setbacks,\" Mr. Kavanaugh notes. Here are four of his most valued advisers.</p><p>Michael Dell</p><p>Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies Inc.</p><p>Mr. Kavanaugh met Mr. Dell at a tech-industry event in the early 1990s. They competed against each other for years, though their companies eventually became business partners. \"Jim and I both grew up in this industry,\" Mr. Dell recollects. The tech tycoon's impressive adaptability inspired Mr. Kavanaugh to propose that WWT buy a software-development business. Fellow executives worried he was moving WWT away from its core focus. \"If we don't move into this space, we are going to lose our edge.\" Mr. Kavanaugh said. WWT acquired a small software-development consultancy in 2015.</p><p>Chuck Robbins</p><p>Chairman and CEO of Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>Mr. Kavanaugh has known Mr. Robbins since the latter was a Cisco middle manager decades ago. Mr. Robbins took command of the networking-equipment giant in 2015. The Cisco leader later encouraged Mr. Kavanaugh to increase his involvement with the broader business community. \"People often say leadership is lonely, but it doesn't always have to be if you have a strong community around you,\" Mr. Robbins observes. \"My peer network has been tremendously helpful to me as we've navigated many of the same complex challenges.\"</p><p>Joe Koenig</p><p>President of World Wide Technology LLC</p><p>Mr. Koenig was Mr. Kavanaugh's college roommate -- and has served as his second-in-command since 1993. The result? \"Joe tells me what I need to hear . . . whether I like it or not,\" the CEO says. For example, Mr. Koenig once bluntly urged him to shut up and listen more when he was pushing to create an innovative resource for customers. Over time, Mr. Kavanaugh says he has come to realize that good leaders know \"when to weigh in with that passion and when to sit back and listen.\" He adds: \"you can make better decisions if you listen to understand.\"</p><p>Michael Bush</p><p>CEO of Great Place to Work Institute Inc.</p><p>Every year, the company headed by Mr. Bush surveys more than 10 million workers at over 10,000 companies to build its list of great places to work and similar tallies, such as Fortune magazine's \"100 Best Companies to Work For.\" Mr. Kavanaugh became acquainted with Mr. Bush after WWT repeatedly landed on those lists. \"His humility is his competitive advantage\" because it makes people feel safe, equal and valued, Mr. Bush says. Mr. Kavanaugh says his mentor helped him understand the value of treating staffers well while generating strong profit: \"One without the other won't work.\"</p>",
