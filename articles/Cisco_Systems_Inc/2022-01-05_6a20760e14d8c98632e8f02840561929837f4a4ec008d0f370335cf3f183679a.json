  "text": "<p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Beyond Theranos. Blood-testing startups are thriving, undeterred by any fallout from the collapse of Theranos Inc., a startup that once sought to revolutionize the industry, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. A federal jury on Monday convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes on charges that she conducted a yearslong fraud scheme against investors. Ms. Holmes testified at trial that she never intended to mislead anyone, and is likely to appeal. Theranos had said it could test for a range of health conditions with a few drops of blood, but unraveled after a series of Wall Street Journal articles in 2015 and 2016 called its proprietary technology into question.</p><p>Nonetheless, venture-capital interest in blood-testing startups has continued despite Theranos's demise, as investors have evaluated individual companies on their merit and potential to make disease detection simpler and more accessible.</p><p>Last year, several startups raised venture financings and others were acquired.</p><p>3%</p><p>The quits rate for workers in November, returning to a record rate last seen in September, the Labor Department said.

TPG—based in Fort Worth, Texas, and San Francisco—plans to price its offering next Wednesday and list shares the following day, although the timing could change, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mainstream Lenders Dabble in Crypto Outside the U.S.</p><p>Mainstream banks outside the U.S. are sampling cryptocurrencies, offering customers ways to invest and store bitcoin and other digital assets, WSJ reports. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA —Spain's second-largest lender by assets, with operations in Latin America and Turkey—allows customers to hold, buy and sell bitcoin and ether through a digital account. Australia's largest bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, has also launched a pilot program to offer similar services. In Germany, a group of savings banks, which together serve 50 million of the country's 80 million people, said it is considering offering cryptocurrency wallets. If the group proceeds, the move would be a significant step toward acceptance for crypto in a country that is ultraconservative with money.</p><p>Newsletter Special</p><p>The global venture market nearly doubled in 2021, according to research firm Crunchbase Inc.</p><p>Private companies raised $642.9 billion in venture capital in 2021, up from $335.4 billion the prior year.
