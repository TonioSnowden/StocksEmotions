  "title": "Startup Sells Insurance Coverage for Cloud Outages; New York-based Parametrix Insurance sells protection against the not-so-uncommon cloud glitch",
  "text": "<p>Some 50 brokers offer Parametrix's policies, which cover outages at major cloud providers, such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp.'s Azure and Alphabet Inc.'s Google Cloud, as well as e-commerce platforms on which a retailer may depend. Business-insurance agency ComTech-Leavitt Insurance Services Inc. of St. George, Utah, this week joined the list of brokers offering the policy.</p><p>Downtime insurance is a relatively new field. But unlike the cybersecurity insurance industry, which has taken off with the rise of ransomware attacks, few companies offer insurance for an event caused by a software, network or other glitch, say analysts who follow the cloud business.</p><p>Outages aren't uncommon. Amazon Web Services, for instance, suffered at least three outages in December, spurring disruptions at other companies and underscoring how regional digital infrastructure problems can have far-reaching effects.</p><p>The number of cloud outages increased by only 3% in 2021 compared with 2020, according to ThousandEyes, a Cisco Systems Inc. company that conducts cloud and internet performance monitoring. But the number of outages lasting 30 minutes or longer has nearly tripled.</p><p>Policy premiums for Parametrix's insurance can range from thousands of dollars annually to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, according to the company. Coverage typically ranges from $100,000 to $5 million but can extend to $10 million in some cases. While Parametrix created and oversees the policies, payouts are backed by reinsurance companies like Hannover Re and certain underwriters of Lloyd's of London.</p><p>\"Generally, most businesses will actually know how much they lose in a downtime event,\" said Neta Rozy, a Parametrix co-founder and the company's chief technology officer. \"But, if not, we have benchmarks based on industry, size of company and a few other parameters and we can recommend coverage per hour.\"</p><p>Coralogix, a Tel Aviv data analytics company, took out a Parametrix policy in August 2021. The company runs on AWS.</p><p>Coralogix customers are mostly cloud and internet-service providers. The company monitors their software applications in real time, records performance and issues alerts if it spots a potential problem. If Coralogix's service is unavailable due to an AWS cloud outage, the data analytics company promises to reimburse its customers a portion of their monthly fee for the time the Coralogix service was inaccessible.</p><p>Coralogix Chief Executive Ariel Assaraf declined to say how much customers are reimbursed. But, he said, \"for us being able to get paid by our insurance whenever there's a cloud outage mitigates that risk.\"</p><p>Trevor White, a research manager at technology research and advisory firm Nucleus Research, believes the use case for Parametrix's insurance is going to be very specific.</p><p>Big businesses aren't usually dependent on one cloud platform and many companies' operations aren't meaningfully affected by a cloud outage of just a few hours, he said.</p><p>But, he said, for businesses running on a single vendor's cloud platform and operating in a competitive, time-sensitive environment—such as a restaurant, retailer or computer-services provider—the insurance could prove valuable.</p><p>Parametrix's Ms. Rozy believes virtually every business needs technology-downtime insurance.</p><p>Craig Lowery, a vice president, analyst, at technology research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. who covers cloud computing, said while many cybersecurity policies cover cloud downtime that results from a cyberattack, he hasn't come across many insurers offering policies that cover cloud downtime from noncyber events.</p><p>Several insurance companies, such as Chubb Ltd., offer cybersecurity policies that cover data-restoration costs and legal fees in the wake of a data breach, among other areas. Cyber insurance policies can also cover lost revenue if a business's operations are interrupted for a period due to a cyber event.</p><p>For payment on business interruptions caused by a cybersecurity incident, the business would have to be affected for a period of time that—depending on the policy—could range from eight hours to 24 or more hours.</p><p>Parametrix pays out after a one-hour waiting period. It said its policies can serve as a complement to cyber insurance for clients that have taken out cyber insurance policies with business-interruption provisions that don't kick in until eight or more hours of downtime.</p><p>\"I see this as bridging the gap due to waiting periods on cyber policies,\" said Joseph Weipert, co-owner and senior vice president at ComTech-Leavitt.</p><p>Write to John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.com</p><p>Startup Sells Insurance Coverage for Cloud Outages</p>",
