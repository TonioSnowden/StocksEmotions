  "text": "<p>The U.S. will accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing the fighting in Ukraine as the humanitarian crisis from Russia's attack on its neighbor worsens, administration officials said Thursday.</p><p>More than 10 million people in Ukraine have been uprooted by the fighting, the United Nations estimates. More than 3.6 million of them have fled the country, the U.N. says, most bound for Poland.</p><p>A senior administration official said Thursday more details would come, but officials are looking at a range of legal pathways... The official said the administration is \"working in particular to expand and develop new programs with a focus on welcoming Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.\" The official added that the U.S. is \"committed to protecting the most vulnerable among the refugee populations that have already fled,\" such as gay and transgender individuals, those with medical needs, and dissidents.</p><p>Witness the modern left, only willing to accept a single percentage point of the population uprooted by war—a number amounting to even less than 1% of the unfilled jobs in the United States—yet eager to apply a sexuality test to people fleeing combat. If the boys in refugee camps agree to enter girls' swimming competitions, will they be allowed to escape? Whichever geniuses in the Biden administration came up with the idea of exploiting this monumental horror to promote Democrats' social policy agenda should be fired immediately—before they start demanding vaccine cards as a condition of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>If Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris remain unmoved by the scale of human suffering in Ukraine, perhaps they can be persuaded to welcome more refugees—regardless of their sexuality—given all the talent that is just waiting to enrich the United States.</p><p>The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency says that the adult literacy rate in Ukraine is nearly 100%. Given recent history this column's most celebrated alumnus might count a CIA citation among the worst appeals to authority. But the spies aren't the only ones who've noticed Ukrainian education levels.</p><p>Liz Alderman and Patricia Cohen report in the New York Times:</p><p>Ukraine is recognized for its skilled work force, with 70 percent of workers holding secondary or higher education degrees. The country boasts the largest tech engineering force in central and Eastern Europe, drawing Microsoft, Cisco, Google and other multinational companies to outsource work there.</p><p>OK, the authority of the Times isn't what it used to be, either. But this is not a controversial thesis. The Journal has been noting for yearsthe tech talent in the region.</p><p>With the region now in flames, not all of the potential new Americans are ready to come here. As the Times reporters note, a lot of that talent is currently engaged:</p><p>Programmers, lawyers and truck drivers are among the tens of thousands of Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 to pick up arms to defend their country. Most of the refugees flooding out are women and children forced to leave husbands, fathers and brothers behind.</p><p>They need housing, day care and school slots before they can start working. Many women are eager to return home to Ukraine quickly, once the war is over.</p><p>But a lot of them might decide that life in the U.S. is very pleasant, and encourage spouses to join them here after the war.</p><p>A smart Biden administration would recognize the chance to simultaneously rescue people in need and strengthen American economic competitiveness. Private firms in various countries are already on the hunt for talent. And the available talent eager to live in peace includes Russians as well as Ukrainians.</p><p>Wharton finance professor Nikolai Roussanov has been noting the brain drain from Vladimir Putin's Russia. Joseph Menn wrote on March 10 in the Washington Post about some of the tech workers who have been leaving:</p><p>\"It's like an exodus of people who don't support this war, and there are a lot of them,\" said a Russian émigré who has lived in Switzerland for 10 years and is now an executive at one small software company and an investor in others. He, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity and that his company not be named because he still has ties to Russia...</p><p>How many Russians have fled their country is unknown. Russia does not require its citizens to have government permission to exit the country, and the United Nations is not tracking the total.</p><p>But anecdotal evidence suggests the number is at least in the tens of thousands, amid reports of burgeoning Russian-speaking émigré communities arising in Dubai, Istanbul and other places where air service from Russia still exists. More than 20,000 Russians have entered Georgia in recent days, the country's economic minister said Monday.</p><p>Konstantin Sonin, a political economist at the University of Chicago's School of Public Policy, estimated the overall Russian exodus at 200,000 in 10 days.</p><p>Why let Dubai have all the fun?</p><p>Of course no discussion of intellectual talent in eastern Europe is complete without marveling at the way the Ukrainian government has skillfully used technology to rally global support and counter one of the world's most feared armies. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister and minister of digital transformation, tweets this week like the young tech entrepreneur that he is:</p><p>A month ago, we all worked on FaceID and CRM systems to process calls for eServices. Now, we work on automatic identification of occupiers' corpses and autodial RU subscribers to tell the truth about the war. We have all changed. And we all do different things. Glory to Ukraine!</p><p>Mr. Fedorov's glorious work in Ukraine is too important to leave right now. But there's an executive in Russia who just might be willing to consider a new job and a change of scenery. Bloomberg News reports:</p><p>Russia's highly regarded central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina sought to resign after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, only to be told by the president to stay, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.</p><p>Nominated for a new five-year term last week, Nabiullina's current views couldn't be learned. She is left to manage the fallout from a war that's quickly undone much of what's she's accomplished in the nine years since she took office. The people said departure now would be seen as a betrayal by the president, with whom she has worked closely for nearly two decades.</p><p>Nabiullina, 58, hasn't commented publicly on her reappointment and didn't respond to a query for this article. The central bank's press service didn't respond to a request for comment for this article. After it was published, the press service told Tass that it \"doesn't correspond to reality,\" providing no further details. A Kremlin spokesman didn't reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Here's a comment the Biden administration should be offering to Ms. Nabiullina and to many more people from Russia and Ukraine:</p><p>Welcome to America.</p><p>***</p><p>Mr. Freeman will host \"WSJ at Large\" this Friday at 7:30 pm EDT on the Fox Business Network.
