  "title": "Sound and Vision: Uniphore Buys Emotion Research Lab to Gauge Video Chat; The deal, which closed this week, comes amid rising enterprise video usage in the wake of the pandemic and lockdowns",
  "text": "<p>Uniphore, backed in part by John Chambers, former executive chairman and chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., sells automation software that helps clients handle and analyze contact center calls. This includes AI assistants that coach human agents about a customer's emotion in real time, based on data points such as tone of voice and word choice.</p><p>With its acquisition of Emotion Research Lab, Uniphore is betting that the growth of video calls, especially in sales and marketing functions, will spur enterprise demand for tools that can analyze what customers and prospects might be feeling. The startup's computer vision software can gauge sentiment based on facial expressions and other visual cues.</p><p>\"I can be completely silent for 15 minutes and yet communicate a lot of emotion with video,\" Uniphore CEO Umesh Sachdev said, speaking about the strategy behind the acquisition. \"And that was the thing that was missing in our armory.\"</p><p>Uniphore is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and Emotion Research Lab is based in Valencia, Spain. Uniphore didn't disclose the size of Emotion Research Lab, but its co-founders Alicia Mora and Maria Pocov√≠ have joined the roughly 300-employee Uniphore.</p><p>Emotion AI software can gauge  the tenor of a conversation based on speech rate, tone and more, and then suggest how an agent should respond, such as slowing down or listening more.</p><p>\"With the strong [work from home] trend and everyone using remote work collaboration tools, this technology could see more adoption in the workplace,\" said Annette Zimmermann, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner Inc ., in an email.</p><p>She added that she was not aware of any vendors with strong capabilities for both voice-based and facial expression analysis.</p><p>An October Gartner report projected that by 2024, only 25% of enterprise meetings will take place in person, down from 60% in 2019.</p><p>Mr. Chambers took a 10% stake in Uniphore in 2017 through his investment firm, JC2 Ventures. He said in the early weeks of the pandemic he encouraged Uniphore to obtain video analytics capabilities to get ahead of shifting workforce trends.</p><p>He said AI analytics software can help companies retain and acquire new customers. \"AI will be the most fundamental change since the internet,\" Mr. Chambers said, and the fastest adoption and strongest investment returns will take place in contact centers. He added the acquisition will position Uniphore to assist with AI deployments across enterprises.</p><p>The deal marks the first acquisition for Uniphore, which has raised $70 million in venture capital from investors including March Capital Partners and Chiratae Ventures since its founding in 2008.</p><p>Uniphore has roughly 70 customers globally, including PNB MetLife India Insurance Co . and WNS Global Services , both based in India.</p><p>Write to Jared Council at jared.council@wsj.com</p>",
