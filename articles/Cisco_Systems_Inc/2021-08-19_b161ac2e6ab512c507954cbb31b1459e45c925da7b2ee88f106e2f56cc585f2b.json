  "title": "Nutanix stock falls on fears of sales miss, but one analyst says his data shows otherwise",
  "text": "<p>Nutanix NTNX shares dropped as much as 9% to an intraday low of $32.55 at last check. Even with the drop, shares are up 57% over the past 12 months, compared with a 30% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX. The decline would be the largest since shares dove 9.2% in February after poor earnings guidance.</p><p>On Thursday, research firm OTR Global reportedly downgraded Nutanix to a “mixed” rating from “positive,” citing checks that indicated that fourth-quarter sales would come in below expectations as customers are taking longer to make purchase decisions. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect a fourth-quarter loss of 42 cents a share on revenue of $362.9 million, or an 11% increase from the year-ago period.</p><p>Piper Sandler analyst James Fish, however, said that his checks into the HCI sector were “quite strong” overall. HCI, or hyperconverged infrastructure, essentially combines computer storage and servers in a hybrid-cloud product, allowing businesses to access on-site computing power as well as public-cloud assets.</p><p>Fish, who has an overweight rating on Nutanix, called the pullback “a strong opportunity” to buy the stock before the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report scheduled for Sept. 1.</p><p>“Our checks of 32 respondents for Nutanix, which includes some of the largest global channel partners, were the most positive in 7 quarters and suggest 3% upside in FQ4,” Fish said.</p><p>Fish also said that shares were down “following a competitors' report about FQ4 results coming in below plan, albeit the FQ1 pipeline being stronger.”</p><p>Fish did not name names, but the only Nutanix competitor that reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results recently was Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO late Wednesday. Cisco's fourth-quarter results, however, were slightly above its own and Wall Street's estimates.</p>",
