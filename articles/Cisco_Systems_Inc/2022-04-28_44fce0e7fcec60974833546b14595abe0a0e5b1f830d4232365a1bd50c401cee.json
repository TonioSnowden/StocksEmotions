  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Kremlin-Tied Hackers Accused of Wartime Attacks",
  "text": "<p>\"The attacks have not only degraded the systems of institutions in Ukraine but have also sought to disrupt people's access to reliable information and critical life services, and have attempted to shake confidence in the country's leadership,\" Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust, said in a blog post accompanying the research.</p><p>In a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's cyber defense agency, said he thought Russia had activated its full offensive cyber capabilities against Ukraine as the war has dragged on and was unlikely to deploy \"completely new\" or unexpected cyber weapons.</p><p>\"They are a serious threat. It would be a mistake to underestimate their potential \" Mr. Zhora said. \"But at the same time. . .I suppose that we are completely able to resist, in cyberwar and the war generally.\"</p><p>The Russia-backed hackers had also been \"pre-positioning for conflict\" as early as March 2021, Mr. Burt said, apparently in hopes of gaining broader access to Ukrainian networks that could be leveraged during the war. By mid-2021, some of the hackers were targeting supply-chain vendors in Ukraine and elsewhere \"to secure further access not only to systems in Ukraine but also NATO member states,\" Mr. Burt said, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Supply-chain vendors are companies that sell software or other products that are widely used by other companies, making them lucrative targets for hackers.</p><p>The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request to comment. Moscow has routinely denied allegations of cyberattacks against other countries and said it has been victimized recently by cyberattacks launched by Western powers.</p><p>The new findings from Microsoft, published Wednesday, largely support what cybersecurity experts, large technology companies and Western intelligence officials have observed so far: While large-scale, knockout blows have eluded them or been thwarted, Russian hackers have been highly active in the Ukraine conflict, focusing much of their efforts on more limited, tactical operations to support their military engagements.</p><p>Some attacks have been crude and amounted to mere annoyances, slowing some Ukrainians' internet service or knocking it out altogether, defacing websites and destroying files on a small number of computers. Others have accomplished little more than keeping Ukraine's cyber-defenders busy. More recently, as Russia's strategic aims shifted to eastern Ukraine, new and more alarming attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have been discovered.</p><p>Hackers have been pummeling the Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure since the beginning of the war, but over the past three weeks researchers at Cisco Systems Inc. have seen a gradual increase in sophisticated attacks from what appear to be more-experienced hackers, said Matt Olney, Cisco's director of threat intelligence. \"Before it was truly bull-in-a-china-shop type of stuff,\" he said. \"Now it's more [like] sophisticated art theft.\"</p><p>In contrast to the confidence expressed by Mr. Zhora of the Kyiv government, U.S. and Western intelligence officials have said they believe Russia has the capabilities and resources to deliver far-more-damaging cyberattacks against Ukraine.</p><p>Microsoft said it had observed nearly 40 destructive cyberattacks in Ukraine on hundreds of systems. Of those, more than 40% targeted critical infrastructure sectors that could have knock-on effects on the Ukrainian government, military, economy and populace, Microsoft said.</p><p>---</p><p>Robert McMillan contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
