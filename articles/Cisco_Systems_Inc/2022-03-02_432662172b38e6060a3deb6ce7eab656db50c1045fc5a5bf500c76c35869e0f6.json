  "title": "U.S. News: Judicial Conflicts Spread to Appeals --- Cases involving Cisco, StarKist Tuna and Bank of America are among those reviewed",
  "text": "<p>In each case, federal judges had failed to properly recuse themselves after having financial ties to litigants in violation of a 48-year-old law. The appeals courts now have to decide whether the conflicts were enough to warrant wiping out the rulings by the conflicted judges.</p><p>At least 55 cases overseen by judges with recusal violations have been appealed, reconsidered or reassigned. A Wall Street Journal investigation last year revealed that more than 130 judges violated the financial-conflict law.</p><p>In considering the violations, a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling requires courts to consider the risk of injustice to litigants if they vacate rulings, the risk of injustice in other cases and the risk of undermining confidence in the judicial process. Litigants in appeals have leaned on the ruling, each side arguing that the test favors their desired outcome.</p><p>StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea were accused by retail and commercial buyers of conspiring to inflate tuna prices. The cases were filed as StarKist and Bumble Bee pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to fix prices, with fines of $100 million for StarKist and $25 million for Bumble Bee.</p><p>Judge Janis Sammartino in 2019 sided with the plaintiffs in certifying a class action, which was overturned by a three-judge panel in 2021 for abusing her discretion in how she certified the classes.</p><p>As the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal began hearing arguments, the Journal reported that Judge Sammartino's husband owned shares of companies of two members of the plaintiff's class, Target Corp. and Sysco Corp.</p><p>StarKist argued that Judge Sammartino's recusal violation was a further reason to throw out her class certification. Lawyers for the class said StarKist's objection should be rejected.</p><p>A decision is pending.</p><p>Judge Sammartino, a George W. Bush appointee, directed a clerk to file notices of financial conflicts in 140 cases after the Journal contacted her. She didn't respond to a phone message.</p><p>In an appeal in New York, the Journal identified a financial conflict involving federal Judge Lewis Liman, a Donald Trump appointee, in a large antitrust class action.</p><p>The 2020 suit against 10 banks seeks to recover damages that plaintiffs say exceed $10 billion for overcharging them on bond purchases. Judge Liman didn't disclose that a family member owned as much as $15,000 in Bank of America Corp., a defendant. Last year, Judge Liman granted the motion of defendants including Bank of America to dismiss in the case with prejudice.</p><p>In a court notice filed Friday, the court clerk wrote of Judge Liman that his wife's \"ownership of stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions in this case. However, that stock ownership would have required recusal.\"</p><p>A lawyer for the plaintiffs said they would consider whether to seek relief.</p><p>Judge Liman didn't respond to a request to comment. The bank case is one of 13 lawsuits in which the judge, after an inquiry last month from the Journal, asked a clerk to file notices to parties in those cases saying he should have disqualified himself.</p><p>Judge Henry Morgan in Norfolk, Va., discovered his own financial conflict in a patent-infringement case that Centripetal Networks Inc., a Virginia company, filed against Cisco Systems.</p><p>After a bench trial but before issuing an opinion, Judge Morgan disclosed that he had learned that his wife held $4,700 of Cisco stock during the trial.</p><p>Centripetal raised no objection to his remaining on the case, but Cisco requested that Judge Morgan step aside. Though he hadn't said how he would rule in the case, Judge Morgan had asked the parties for information about damages, a good omen for Centripetal.</p><p>At a hearing, the judge said he would direct his lawyer to place the shares in blind trust.</p><p>He denied Cisco's recusal motion in October 2020 and soon found that the company infringed Centripetal's patents, awarding $1.9 billion in damages.</p><p>Cisco appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The company has argued that federal law required Judge Morgan to recuse or his wife to sell her Cisco shares for him to continue to hear the case. Lawyers for Centripetal said Judge Morgan made an ethical decision in moving the Cisco shares to a blind trust. The appellate court has yet to issue a decision.</p><p>Lawyers for Centripetal and Cisco declined to comment. Judge Morgan, a George H.W. Bush appointee, didn't respond to a request for comment sent to his chambers.</p>",
