  "text": "<p>Starboard founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smith is appearing at an activist-investing conference, the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit, Tuesday, and is expected to detail the fund's plans then, the people said.</p><p>Splunk, founded in 2003, makes software used by companies' information-technology and security operations to monitor threats and analyze data.</p><p>It has a market value of $11.4 billion after the shares dropped nearly 40% this year amid a broader selloff of technology stocks. In late March, its market value was nearly $24 billion and at the peak in September 2020 was above $35 billion as the pandemic stoked demand for cloud computing. Earlier this year, when Splunk was without a chief executive and its shares had plummeted following a series of disappointing earnings reports, it attracted takeover interest from at least one strategic suitor. Networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. made a takeover offer valued at more than $20 billion for Splunk, The Wall Street Journal reported in February, noting that the companies weren't in active talks at the time. There isn't a sign that has changed.</p><p>Splunk named Gary Steele as its CEO in March after former Chief Executive Doug Merritt stepped down from the role late last year. Mr. Steele is the founding CEO of Proofpoint Inc., an information-security company that was acquired by software-investment firm Thoma Bravo in 2021.</p><p>The same week as Mr. Steele's announcement, Hellman &amp; Friedman LLC disclosed a 7.5% stake in the software maker, in a bet on the company and him. That came after Silver Lake made a $1 billion investment in the company last year to help support a transformation of the business.</p>",
