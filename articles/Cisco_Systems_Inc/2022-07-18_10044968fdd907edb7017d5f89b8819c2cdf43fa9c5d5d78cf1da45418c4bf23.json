  "text": "<p>\"After careful consideration, we see it as impossible given the current situation to continue our business in Russia,\" Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said.</p><p>H&amp;M is the latest Western company to ultimately decide to exit Russia as the war drags on and Western sanctions make operating in the country more complicated. Last month, companies including Nike Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. announced plans to leave Russia. Others, including McDonald's Corp., have sold their operations in the country.</p><p>As part of H&amp;M's winding-down process, the company said it plans to temporarily reopen physical stores for a limited period to sell remaining inventory in Russia.</p><p>H&amp;M said it expects its departure from Russia to result in one-off costs of around 2 billion Swedish kronor, equivalent to about $192 million. It said those costs would be booked in the third quarter.</p><p>The company has run operations in Russia since 2009, though currently all of H&amp;M's stores in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are closed. Together, the 181 stores have around 7,500 employees and represented around 10% of group operating profit before the coronavirus pandemic, in the 2019 financial year.</p><p>Write to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com</p><p>H&amp;M to Exit Russia, Citing 'Impossible' Situation</p>",
