What strategists say about the reaction to the July minutes</p><p>According to one analyst, resurgent fretting over central bank monetary policy tightening is being used as an excuse for profit-taking.</p><p>\"After a very strong run for risk assets thanks to a narrative that we might have seen 'peak inflation,' Wednesday put a stop to that as multiple headlines came through that poured cold water on the prospect that central banks were about to let up on hiking rates,\" said Henry Allen, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>See: Federal Reserve officials back moving interest rates higher in order to slow the economy, minutes show</p><p>On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he is considering supporting another large rate rise at the central bank's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.</p><p>\"I would lean toward the 75 basis points at this point,\" Bullard said in a Wall Street Journal interview. \"Again, I think we've got relatively good reads on the economy, and we've got very high inflation, so I think it would make sense to continue to get the policy rate higher and into restrictive territory.\"</p><p>However, Kansas City Fed President Esther George struck a more cautious tone as she remains concerned about the inflation outlook. She said how fast rate hikes will happen is something policy makers \"will continue to debate,\" though the direction is pretty clear. Both Bullard and George are voters this year on the Federal Open Market Committee.</p><p>See: The Fed is not getting cold feet about wrestling inflation to the ground, so stop misreading its minutes</p><p>Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also saidthe Fed is trying to achieve a balancing act, not raising its benchmark interest rates by such a small amount so that high inflation rates will persist, but also not pushing policy rates up too high and slowing the economy unnecessarily.</p><p>\"US stocks traded mixed as investors grappled with relatively strong US economic data that might keep the door open for aggressive Fed tightening for the rest of the year,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA said. \"The economy still looks good as the housing market continues to cool.\"</p><p>U.S. existing-home sales fell 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.81 million in July.</p><p>In other U.S. economic data, investors digested initial jobless claims, which showed that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits decreased by 2,000 last week from a revised 252,000 during the first week of August.</p><p>See: Jobless claims fall to 250,000 and show little sign of surging layoffs</p><p>The Philadelphia Fed Index of local manufacturing activity came in at 6.2, well above the FactSet consensus of minus five. Later in the morning, data on U.S. existing-home sales showed they declined for a sixth month in a row.</p><p>Economists still asserted that markets have reason to be concerned about an economic slowdown in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi, said that even though financial markets had become more positive of late, \"we remain concerned about the underlying fundamentals of the global economy. Our sense is that economic performance is likely to be plagued by high inflation, slowing real GDP growth, and rapidly tightening monetary policy for some time to come.\"</p><p>Related: Expect rolling recessions as Citi cuts economic forecasts</p><p>Single-stock movers</p><p>* Following a massive run-up, shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.
