  "text": "<p>But the consequences of an infection spreading to that deeper layer are dire for any energy company. Many machines that control pipelines, refineries and power plants are well past their prime, have few protections against sophisticated attacks and could be manipulated to muck with equipment or cause damage, cybersecurity experts say.</p><p>Last year, a ransomware attack moved from a natural-gas company's networks into the control systems at a compression facility, halting operations for two days, according to a Department of Homeland Security alert. The company, which Homeland Security didn't name, didn't have a plan to respond to a cyberattack, the agency said.</p><p>The Colonial ransomware attack is a high-profile example of the online assaults that U.S. companies, schools, hospitals and other organizations now face regularly. It should also serve as a wake-up call for the energy industry's particular exposure, consultants and others who work with companies to shore up cybersecurity said.</p><p>U.S. and industry officials have known for years about such problems surrounding the nation's energy infrastructure. A cybersecurity unit of Homeland Security said in 2016 it had worked to identify and mitigate 186 vulnerabilities throughout the energy sector, the most of any critical-infrastructure industry that year. In 2018, federal officials warned that hackers working for Russia had infiltrated the control rooms of U.S. electric utilities.</p><p>The energy industry is a big target. The U.S. has 2.5 million miles of pipelines. Across that vast network are hundreds of thousands of devices -- sensors that take myriad readings, valves that help control flow and pressure within a pipeline and leak detection systems -- and all are vulnerable to attack, security experts said.</p><p>Refineries have even more valves and sensors than big pipelines, and there are about 135 of those across the country. That doesn't include electric utilities and all the components of the sprawling power grid.</p><p>Colonial ferries 100 million gallons a day of gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products from the country's chief refining corridor along the Gulf Coast to Linden, N.J. It transports roughly 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to the company's website.</p><p>Curtis Smith, a spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell PLC, one the owners of the Colonial Pipeline, said on Sunday it is still too early to \"be specific about potential impacts to product flow.\" He said Shell is actively engaged with Colonial.</p><p>The type of attack that occurred against Colonial Pipeline is becoming more frequent and is something that businesses need to be concerned with, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Sunday.</p><p>The attacks are \"here to stay and we have to work in partnership with businesses to secure networks, to defend ourselves against these attacks,\" she said on CBS. Specific to the Colonial attack, \"it's an all-hands-on-deck effort right now.\"</p><p>In response to the pipeline shutdown, the Transportation Department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said it issued a temporary hours of service exemption for trucks transporting gasoline and other refined products across 17 states, including Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee.</p><p>On Sunday, Colonial didn't provide a timeline for bringing the pipeline back into service but said that while its main lines remained offline, some smaller lateral lines between terminals and delivery points were once again operational.</p><p>As markets opened Sunday evening, gasoline futures were up about 1.6% at $2.16 per gallon, after briefly rising more than 3% higher.</p><p>Analysts said a closure of the pipeline for a few days shouldn't have dramatic market impacts, because inventories of gasoline have been readied for the summer driving season and usually get replenished every five to six days. But if the pipeline remains offline for five days or longer, shortages could begin to affect retail stations and consumers along the East Coast, they said.</p><p>Two people briefed on the probe said the attack appeared to be limited to information systems and hadn't infiltrated control systems.</p><p>A report by an International Business Machine Corp. unit found energy companies in 2020 sustained the third-most attacks of any industry, up from ninth in 2019, as cybercriminals ramped up assaults on firms with software connected to operational control systems.</p><p>The industry is ill-prepared for such attacks, security experts said. Some operational technologies -- for physical systems like pipelines and the electric grid -- have protocols that predate those for the internet, said Padraic O'Reilly, co-founder and chief product officer of Boston-based CyberSaint Security, who works with pipelines on cybersecurity.</p><p>\"There are just as many [operational technology] vulnerabilities as there are IT vulnerabilities, but they're scarier in a way because they can go cyber to physical,\" Mr. O'Reilly said.</p><p>These weak spots have been known for years, but most energy companies have only recently begun to implement defenses to protect control systems, said Raymond Sevier, a technical-solutions architect with Cisco Systems Inc., who focuses on industrial systems.</p><p>The control systems were considered safe for years because they weren't connected to the internet, but hackers found ways to penetrate them through unsecured remote-access and networked systems.</p><p>---</p><p>Eric Morath contributed to this article.</p>",
