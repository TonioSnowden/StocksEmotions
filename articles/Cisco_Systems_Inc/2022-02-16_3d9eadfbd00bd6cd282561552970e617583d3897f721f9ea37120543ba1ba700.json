  "text": "<p>He notes that even as investors piled a record $913 billion of flows into equities last year, the cumulative $750 billion switch into equities since 2007 still looks low, at least compared to $4 trillion poured into bond funds. “Bitter experience means that we are wary of calling a multi-decade switch back to equities, but the data do suggest scope for further rotation over the shorter term,” said Groman, who previously was a financial economist at the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>As for regional preferences, flows into ex-U.S. funds have outpaced U.S.-inclusive funds for seven of the last eight months as a percent of assets under management. “Investors do seem to be diversifying outside the U.S. but were already doing so before this year's underperformance. The shift in flows still seems small compared to the prior preference for the U.S.-inclusive funds, so maybe there is more to come,” said Groman.</p><p>Value funds have seen seven consecutive weeks of inflows, compared to six straight weeks of growth outflows. But the magnitude of those flows are small. Cumulative flows into value funds last year when there was a rotation reached $70 billion, compared to this year's $23 billion inflow.</p><p>“The flow drivers behind recent market rotations remain relatively modest. As further capital chases the recent winning trades, they could move further. Although [the first quarter 2021] rotation soon fizzled out, we suspect that its [first quarter 2022] counterpart could run further,” he said.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The retail sales report for January is due for release, with economists expecting an improvement in seasonally adjusted terms, while the minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be released in the afternoon. Inflation in the U.K. reached a 30-year high of 5.5% in January.</p><p>Developments between Russia and Ukraine still hang over the market. U.S. President Joe Biden says the U.S. has not verified Russia's claim about a partial troop withdrawal, and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said Russia has actually increased the number of troops, and that more troops are on their way.
