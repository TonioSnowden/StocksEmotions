  "title": "Dell Might Be Tech's Cheap Dark Horse; PC sales are slowing from their pandemic boom. But Dell's sharp focus on the corporate market is helping it pick up share.",
  "text": "<p>Much of the market's dim view on Dell can be attributed to the company's evolution into a titan of huge-but-mature tech hardware markets such as personal computers, servers and data-storage systems. Following the completion of the spinoff of its ownership stake in VMware late last year, about two-thirds of Dell's revenue now comes from PCs and related peripherals such as displays and webcams. These enjoyed a boost from the pandemic in what typically has been a slow-to-no-growth business. According to market research firm IDC, global PC shipments averaged an annual decline of 1.4% over the 10-year period before the pandemic's start in early 2020.</p><p>PC shipments jumped to double-digit growth annual rates over the past two years, but that is fading now. Yet while Dell has long been a third-place player in PCs in terms of market share, its strong exposure to the corporate market relative to the more volatile consumer side has proven to be a boon. IDC says global PC shipments fell 5.1% year over year in the first quarter, but Dell's shipments rose 6% in the same period while Lenovo and HP saw theirs fall 9% and 18%, respectively. Dell is also the only one of the three to have gained market share in 2021, per IDC's data.</p><p>PCs are clearly through their pandemic boom. But with most companies settling into a hybrid work environment—with employees splitting their time between office and working from home—sales of PCs and peripherals are likely to remain elevated from their prepandemic levels. Simon Leopold of Raymond James says commercial PC demand \"has remained healthy\" even as consumer demand has cooled.</p><p>The near-term outlook for Dell's server and data-storage business is a bit murkier given Cisco Systems' most recent quarterly results. The network equipment giant posted a rare revenue miss for the fiscal quarter ended April and issued an even bleaker forecast, mostly blaming Covid 19-related lockdowns in China that have constrained the company's ability to get the necessary components to ship its products. That report cast a shadow over other companies in IT hardware; Dell, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares have averaged a 8% loss since Cisco's report.</p><p>But the selloff also might have set a low bar for Dell's own results due for release on Thursday. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein estimates Dell's backlog of orders for its Infrastructure Solutions segment grew by $1.2 billion in the fiscal quarter ended January, and he added in a note Friday that the company \"has more control of its supply chain than others.\" That won't keep Dell fully immune to the problems afflicting its peers. In this market, though, absence of even worse news might just be good enough.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Dell Might Be Tech's Cheap Dark Horse</p>",
