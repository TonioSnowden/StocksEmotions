  "text": "<p>Stock indexes have climbed in recent weeks on signs that inflation was moderating and hopes that the Fed would ease off from its aggressive campaign of rate rises.</p><p>The rally—which had pushed the S&amp;P 500 to its highest level since April—has been tempered after minutes from the Fed's July meeting indicated policy makers are still willing to raise rates more than currently anticipated if inflation fails to abate. Still, officials said they would be cautious, acknowledging the risk that too much tightening could cause economic pain.</p><p>\"Sentiment has become a lot less negative but I'd be reluctant to say things are bullish. We still have a lot of constraints, lots of uncertainty, and a profits recession is coming,\" said Joe Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Asset Management. \"There is still a narrow pathway toward a 'soft landing,' but it is getting harder and harder to achieve.\"</p><p>New applications for unemployment benefits inched down last week, suggesting the jobs market is holding up despite signs of weakness in the broader economy. Existing-home sales data, due at 10 a.m. ET, are expected to show a further cooling of the U.S. housing market as mortgage rates weigh on sales.</p><p>On the earnings front, shares of Cisco Systems Inc. jumped 6.3% after the maker of networking and security equipment posted flat quarterly revenue, avoiding a decline it previously forecast.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell 12% in premarket trading after investor Ryan Cohen filed to sell his stake in the company.

Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 1.6% to $95.19 a barrel, easing its decline for the month to 8%. The prospect of weakening demand and additional supplies have dragged on crude prices in recent weeks. Gold prices edged up 0.4%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.2%. Dutch payments processor Adyen slumped 12% after reporting higher costs and revenue that missed analysts' forecasts.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.8% and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Waver as Investors Mull Jobs Data, Fed Minutes</p>",
