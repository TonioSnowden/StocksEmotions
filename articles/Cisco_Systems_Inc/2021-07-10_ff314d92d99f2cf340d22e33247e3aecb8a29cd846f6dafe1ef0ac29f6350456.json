  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: A Meme Fantasy Becomes Reality --- The hot companies of the moment are converting hype into actual value. But true believers will pay the price.",
  "text": "<p>Two decades ago psychologist Frank Durgin coined the term \"The Tinkerbell Effect\" to describe things that can exist only because people think they do. The name stems from the original stage play of Peter Pan, in which the audience is asked to clap if they believe in the fairy Tinker Bell, reviving her as if through their applause.</p><p>The same can be said for plenty of things in the financial world, from tulips to dot-com stocks to dogecoin: More believers means more value for something that might not have any. Now, some of the so-called meme stock companies sent into the stratosphere by enthusiastic retail investors have latched onto a Wall Street tradition of transforming faith into intrinsic worth, at least for some.</p><p>Please don't rush out and invest in something your nephew just heard about on Reddit, but recognize that some executives are shrewdly making hay while the sun shines. They might be going about it in a different way, but the effect is similar to what their C-suite predecessors have done over the years.</p><p>An early era of using inflated equity was the Go-Go 1960s. Retail involvement in the stock market was at a record and two plus two could equal five. A group of companies with names like Litton, Teledyne, Textron and ITT began growing rapidly by buying all sorts of unrelated businesses that executives said could create synergies.</p><p>The acquisitions were made with stock or convertible debt because their price-to-earnings ratios were high and they bought companies that sported lower valuations. Their sales would grow as a result, flattered by more lenient accounting rules at the time, seemingly justifying their P/E ratios and market values in a virtuous cycle. An article in the Saturday Evening Post in 1968, at the height of the boom, was titled: \"It Is Theoretically Possible for the Entire United States to Become One Vast Conglomerate Presided Over by Mr. James L. Ling.\"</p><p>The bubble soon collapsed, Mr. Ling of Ling-Temco-Vought found himself unemployed and the companies that he and other \"conglomerateurs\" built saw their P/E ratios fall by as much as two-thirds in a couple of years. But the businesses the companies had bought were real and lingered for decades in some form. Textron, which once made yarn, still exists as an aircraft company.</p><p>The late 1990s saw an even greater upswell of public fascination with stocks. Router pioneer Cisco Systems was in the right business at the right time as the Internet boomed. Its market capitalization rose 2,000-fold until it briefly became the world's most valuable corporation. Cisco acquired 144 companies over a span of 18 years and saw revenue grow 10-fold between 1995 and 2001.</p><p>Another dot-com wonder was AOL, which is remembered for one very big acquisition -- the largest ever at the time -- when it bought Time Warner. It had about 20 million dial-up customers in early 2000 yet it fetched more than 200 times earnings and was twice as valuable on paper as the stodgy media giant it snapped up in possibly the most disastrous deal ever.</p><p>More recently, Tesla has gone from a precarious financial position to stability by raising more money in the stock market than every major auto maker combined. It could do so because its stock-market fans think it is somehow worth more than all those rivals put together.</p><p>Meme stocks aren't taken seriously enough in the business world to use their stock as an acquisition currency, but they don't have to be -- cash will do just fine. AMC Entertainment Holdings, which was headed for likely bankruptcy late last year, has seen its shares appreciate so much and has sold so much stock that its market value was recently more than 100 times as much as it was at the end of 2020. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron is now mulling acquisitions of rival theater chains. During that time analysts' consensus estimate of its sales for this year has dropped by almost a third and no analysts have a \"buy\" rating on it, according to FactSet. GameStop, the original meme stock, was worth less than $200 million in the spring of 2020 and hasn't been profitable in years but found willing buyers for more than $1 billion of its shares last month.</p><p>Selling shares or using them to buy something can make a corporation more valuable. The math only works at the expense of late-arriving true-believers, though, whose contribution is diluted over the existing shareholder base.</p><p>The stock market has always been a mechanism for transferring money from the impatient to the patient, from the unwise to the wise. The people who benefit most from the illusion are corporate insiders who find themselves running larger companies with compensation to match, sometimes selling or giving away as many shares as they can.</p><p>All they need is for the audience to believe until the curtain falls.</p>",
