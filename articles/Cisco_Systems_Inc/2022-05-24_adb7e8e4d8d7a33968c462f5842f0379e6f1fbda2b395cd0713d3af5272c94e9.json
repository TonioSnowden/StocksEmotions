  "title": "Business News: Firms Jump To Buy Back Their Stock",
  "text": "<p>Buybacks reached a new peak of $972 billion during the 12-month period ended in March, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said, up from $499 billion during the prior-year period.</p><p>Share prices of many U.S. businesses have slumped between 15% and 30% since the beginning of the year, as interest-rate increases, high inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and slowing economic growth in the U.S., China and elsewhere worry investors.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is down 16.6% through Monday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about 12% lower year to date. The Russell 2000 has suffered a more than 21% hit since early January, according to FactSet, a data provider.</p><p>But this isn't entirely bad news for companies with excess cash. Sinking stock prices are letting them buy back more of their own shares, reducing share count and boosting earnings per share.</p><p>More than 17% of S&amp;P 500 companies that bought back stock in the first quarter had a share count at least 4% lower than a year earlier, compared with 5.8% of such companies a year earlier, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said.</p><p>Buybacks by S&amp;P 500 companies in the first quarter generated a yield of 2.54%, up from 1.48% a year earlier and down from 3.37% in the first quarter of 2020, when share prices fell during the early days of the pandemic. These yields are calculated by comparing companies' market capitalizations and the volume of buybacks they executed.</p><p>\"As prices have declined, those purchases should result in a tailwind for EPS,\" said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \"You have some bargain hunting here.\"</p><p>Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. is among the companies considering buying back shares.</p><p>\"Looking at where our share price is, it feels like there will be an opportunity to do that more aggressively,\" said Scott Herren, Cisco's chief financial officer.</p><p>Cisco generates about $12 billion to $14 billion in free cash a year and allocates around $6 billion of it toward dividends, leaving the remainder for investing in the business and buying back shares. Cisco's shares are down about 32% year to date; they closed Monday at $43.35.</p><p>LendingTree Inc., which operates an online marketplace for loans and other financial products, also has been buying back stock, including $43 million worth of its shares in the first quarter, up from $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. \"Our price is down, along with everybody else,\" said Trent Ziegler, the company's CFO.</p><p>LendingTree has an internal view on how it expects its business to perform, which informs management's view on what the company's shares should be worth. \"If we feel like the stock is dislocated in the market, and we can buy it and earn attractive returns on it, then that's a good use of cash,\" Mr. Ziegler said.</p><p>The company's shares closed at $59.95 Monday and have more than halved since the beginning of the year. Mr. Ziegler declined to comment on how he thinks LendingTree's shares should be valued.</p><p>Finding the right time to buy back stock is a tricky task for executives and they rarely get it right, advisers and analysts say.</p><p>\"A large chunk of buybacks are done by companies that shouldn't do them,\" said Greg Milano, chief executive of Fortuna Advisors, which advises companies on allocating capital. Companies should consider buybacks after investing in their business, increasing dividends and paying down debt, Mr. Milano said.</p><p>Some companies, including Starbucks Corp., in recent months suspended billion-dollar share-buyback programs to free up cash. Howard Schultz, who returned as interim chief executive in April, said in a letter to employees that the coffee chain would halt buybacks and focus on investing in employees and stores.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
