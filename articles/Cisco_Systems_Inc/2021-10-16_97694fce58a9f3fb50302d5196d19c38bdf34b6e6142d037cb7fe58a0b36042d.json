  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Design & Decorating: Hail the Kings of Comfort --- Interior designers buy sofas for themselves and hard-to-please clients. We asked them: Which couches are the absolute cushiest?",
  "text": "<p>We didn't expect our experts to single out a sofa with no arms as the quintessence of coziness, but Alessandra Wood, vice president of style at interior design service Modsy, chose CB2's Piazza Apartment Sofa. Its comfort, she said, stems from its down-blend seat, a \"super deep unicushion,\" which she compares to a slightly firm mattress \"paired with a luxurious topper.\" The solid seat back also ensures you don't rest on a mess of loose cushions. Width 60 inches, $1,699; Piazza Espresso Velvet Sofa, width 81 inches, $1,899, cb2.com</p><p>Slipcovered, with unstructured feather-and-down cushions, Cisco Home's Donato Sofa exudes the cuddly charm of a pillow fort. Stefanie Brechbuehler, of Brooklyn design firm Workstead, swears by hers, which is covered in Otis linen. She values not only its solace but its near indestructibility. \"People are always surprised to see we have white seating,\" said the mother of two toddlers, \"but the slipcover is endlessly washable, durable and, in a pinch, bleachable.\" From $4,455, Jayson Home 800-472-1885</p><p>David Rockwell's choice, the Mah Jong Sofa from Roche Bobois, is a modular system that lets you stack and rearrange vibrant, tufted seats and ottomans. \"It's not just the sumptuous padding and intuitive modular design that makes it so comfortable,\" said Mr. Rockwell, founder and president of New York's Rockwell Group. \"It's also the relaxed, slouchy spirit of Hans Hopfer's 1971 design. It just invites you to unwind.\" For the sofa's semicentennial, collaborations with fashion's Kenzo Takada, Missoni Home and Jean Paul Gaultier have energized the modern classic with new fabrics. From $1,800 per modular unit, roche-bobois.com</p><p>Handcrafted in North Carolina, Fairfield Furniture's Harry Sofa oozes Southern comfort. Plush cushions top the coiled-spring construction, while an optional nailhead trim dignifies the perimeter. \"It's large and comfortable but doesn't look clunky or bottom-heavy,\" said fan Libby Langdon, an interior designer in New York. A high back, rare in contemporary seating, provides support for tall and short folks alike. \"It's a transitional sofa shape that will stand the design test of time.\" From $4,425, fairfieldchair.com</p><p>The folks at Lark &amp; Palm, a design firm in Sausalito, Calif., vouch for Lawson-Fenning's Morro Sofa. \"It has a wonderful, modern tufted seat cushion with an extra depth that makes it quite luxurious,\" said Ansley Majit, a principal at Lark &amp; Palm. An exposed wood base adds warmth, and the kids can prop themselves on chunky, low-slung armrests during a Halloween movie marathon. From $4,200, lawsonfenning.com</p><p>Architect Mary Maydan's vote goes to Living Divani's Extrasoft Sofa, designed by Pierro Lissoni, which she describes as \"structured but not stiff.\" Cozy blocks of varying heights can be configured into irregular sofa-scapes that welcome catnaps and laptop-work time. In Ms. Maydan's Palo Alto, Calif., home, a double-sided model faces both the TV and the dining area, and is typically crawling with her four kids. \"I want them to feel their house is not a museum, and I think we got it right.\" From $16,830, livingdivani.it</p>",
