  "text": "<p>Royal Mail held back from giving guidance for the current year even after a surge in parcel volumes helped deliver a more than doubling of its annual profit. </p> <p>The coming year “contains a number of uncertainties that could significantly influence volumes and costs,” cautioned Keith Williams, Royal Mail's chair. “Despite this uncertainty, there&#xa0;are grounds for optimism.”</p> <p>For the year ended March Royal Mail's revenue rose 16.6 per cent to £12.6bn. Operating profit on an adjusted basis was up 115 per cent to £702m, slightly below consensus expectations, as higher expenses and a 12.5 per cent decline in mail revenue offset a near 39 per cent increase in parcel revenues. </p> <p>Management committed to paying a 20p dividend for the 2022 full year. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Blackstone has agreed a deal with directors of <strong>St Modwen Properties</strong> to buy the warehouse developer for £1.2bn. The private equity house will pay 542p in cash for St Modwen, a 21 per cent premium to when its proposal at the same price became public in early May. Fund manager JO Hambro, which has disclosed a <a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/j-o-hambro-cap.-mgmt/rns/form-8.3---st.-modwen-properties-plc/202105101206351079Y/\">6.4 per cent stake</a> in St Modwen, has said it cannot support a 542p buyout from Blackstone as management's current plans will deliver value “well in excess of the potential offer”.</p> <p>B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong>&#xa0;said half-year profit will beat market expectations that like-for-like sales growth will be in the mid-to-high teens, an upgrade on its previous guidance of low double-digit growth. Group sales rose 60 per cent year on year to £3.5bn in the first quarter ended April, with the DIY retailer saying it had grown faster than the overall market in the UK and France. </p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> posted a 4 per cent rise in operating profit to £2.9bn for the year ending March. The utility infrastructure group set out plans for capital expenditure of between £30bn and £35bn over the next five years with a target of delivering underlying earnings per share growth of between 5 and 7 per cent a year. </p> <p><strong>Games Workshop</strong>'s second-half earnings will beat expectations, supporting a 50p per share dividend. The fantasy figurine retailer said that for the year ending May its sales will be not less than £350m, up from £270m the year before, and pre-tax profit will be at least £150m from £89m in the previous period. </p> <p><strong>Easyjet</strong> set out plans to fly around 15 per cent of its 2019 capacity in the third quarter ending June. Half-year results from the airline were in line with previous guidance for £645m pre-tax loss, which widened from a £353m loss the year before as revenue plunged 90 per cent to £240m. </p> <p>Defence technology group <strong>Qinetiq</strong> said its order book is strong and momentum is positive heading into the new fiscal year, putting it on track to meet market expectations. Its full-year results to March showed underlying operating profit up 14 per cent to £151.8m.</p> <p><strong>Young &amp; Co</strong> reported encouraging trading since lockdown restrictions lifted in April and reported total group revenue of £90.6m for the year ended March, about 30 per cent of the pre-Covid level. Its results followed the pub group saying overnight that it has appointed property adviser Savills to consider the sale of its tenanted estate.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>US companies have urged President Moon Jae-in of South Korea <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26d77bfe-b55a-4edb-bc57-7370b6c6a670\">to release</a> <strong>Samsung</strong> chair Lee Jae-yong, arguing that the billionaire executive could boost Joe Biden's efforts to shake off American dependence on computer chips produced in foreign countries. The focus on resurrecting America's self-sufficiency in computer chips has intensified after a&#xa0;global shortage&#xa0;in chips used in cars has begun to hit other industries. <strong>Cisco</strong> on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fc88b41-4593-4a25-b888-be8dbb8ff88a\">warned a supply chain squeeze</a> would hit its profit margins in a results presentation on Wednesday, sending its shares down 6 per cent in after-hours trading.</p> <p><strong>Santander's</strong> executive chair Ana Botín <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb8bb908-5a0f-430c-bb8c-3b17dfd2db59\">faced off</a> against Andrea Orcel in a Madrid courtroom on Wednesday as the head of Spain's largest bank said her former friend had never been contracted to become her chief executive. Orcel is claiming tens of millions of euros in compensation from Santander for reversing its plans to hire him in 2019, in one of the highest-profile disputes in European banking in recent years.</p> <p><strong>ByteDance</strong> founder Zhang Yiming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3a0fa61-4e24-409b-856d-468ebb797636\">will step down</a> as chief executive of the group behind popular video app TikTok, in the latest retreat from the limelight by a Chinese tech leader as Beijing cracks down on the industry. Zhang, 38, founded ByteDance almost a decade ago and steered the Beijing-based group that has developed hit apps including TikTok and its sister Chinese platform Douyin through a period of US-China tensions.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Even pre-Covid-19, pubs were among the more heavily indebted sectors — the result, as many a drinker will appreciate, of reckless spending. Pubs, unlike their cashed-up customers, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5de1f7b-e423-48a6-a481-346caf943698\">now need to deleverage</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>The use of private litigation financing in the case of auditor KPMG and its role in the Carillion collapse will not sit well with those who see litigation funding as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f048b020-3cc7-47a7-bb8f-e3ed9f4ab928\">a taint</a> on the judicial process. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Annual profits more than double at Royal Mail ' FT.com 20 May.
