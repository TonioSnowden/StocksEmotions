Shares rose $21.50, or 77%, to $49.50.</p><p>The latest unemployment data showed 268,000 people filed for jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 13, a decline from the previous week. The number of claims is beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels, as employers hang on to their workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>Some investors are closely watching for a Federal Reserve chair nomination after President Joe Biden hinted to reporters Tuesday he could reveal his choice around the end of the week. President Biden will be making his pick between current chair Jerome Powell or Fed governor Lael Brainard.</p><p>Bitcoin traded at around $57,797, extending its fall to a fourth day.
