  "title": "Zero-Based Budgeting Gains Clout as a Way for Companies to Find Savings; Facing high inflation and an uncertain outlook, finance chiefs are using the tool to lower expenses in areas including operations, real estate, logistics, sales and marketing",
  "text": "<p>The uncertain economic outlook combined with high inflation are prompting companies to scrutinize costs, repeating an exercise they did in 2020 when Covid-19 forced many businesses to make blunt cuts.</p><p>Finance chiefs said that this time around, they are looking for more selective changes than in 2020 that will help bring expenses down permanently. They seek to identify savings in areas including operations, real estate, logistics, sales and marketing. Some are focusing on their selling, general and administrative expenses, while others are slowing hiring.</p><p>Among the businesses using zero-based budgeting to some extent are auto manufacturer General Motors Co., industrial firm Honeywell International Inc., cosmetics business Coty Inc., chocolate maker Hershey Co., alcoholic-beverage company Diageo PLC and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., a provider of cloud-based IT solutions.</p><p>Total operating expenses at companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose to a combined $3.34 trillion in the second quarter, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, a data provider. That's up from $2.86 trillion in the prior-year period and $2.35 trillion in the second quarter of 2020, highlighting why executives are working to lower costs.</p><p>Nearly half of respondents to a recent survey of finance chiefs by Gartner Inc., a research firm, said they planned to cut consulting budgets in the coming 12 months, while 45% said they would decrease spending on real estate. Over a third of the 262 U.S. CFOs polled by Gartner in July said they would limit spending on contractors.</p><p>\"There is increased pressure on the chief financial officer to review the cost structure and to potentially outsource tasks,\" said Robert Willems, a senior managing director at consulting firm Accenture PLC. \"We are seeing a lot of people starting with a clean sheet, because they can't rely on their budgets from previous years due to the impact of the pandemic.\"</p><p>Zero-based budgeting, which was developed in the 1970s and first applied by consumer-facing companies, is found more widely these days, with industrial, technology and media companies using it. \"There is more interest in ZBB across sectors,\" said Luke Pototschnik, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, an advisory firm.</p><p>Honeywell</p><p>At Honeywell, CFO Greg Lewis uses zero-based budgeting to scrutinize spending on information technology, research and development, and marketing. \"We are proceeding into the back end of 2022 and entering into planning for 2023 with caution,\" he said. The Charlotte, N.C.-based company, which has a target to bring fixed costs down by 1% per year, may exceed that goal in certain parts of the business, according to Mr. Lewis.</p><p>Honeywell has been relying on ZBB for years. \"Is it relevant in times like these? Yes, absolutely,\" Mr. Lewis said. Honeywell's operating expenses rose to $7.06 billion in the second quarter from $6.88 billion a year earlier, S&amp;P said.</p><p>General Motors</p><p>Detroit-based General Motors is slowing and in some areas even freezing hiring, and homing in on other fixed costs, CFO Paul Jacobson said.</p><p>The company also is deferring some spending on startups in its growth portfolio, except at self-driving-vehicle business Cruise, in which GM holds a majority stake. \"We have to find ways to increase productivity,\" Mr. Jacobson said, adding that demand for GM's cars remains high. \"We are aware that this environment can turn quickly,\" he said.</p><p>GM in 2020 started using ZBB in some parts of the business but isn't \"zero-basing the entire enterprise,\" according to Mr. Jacobson. The company reported total operating expenses of $33.22 billion for the second quarter, up from $30.75 billion during the prior-year period, according to S&amp;P.</p><p>Coty</p><p>Coty, the New York-based owner of cosmetics brands including Max Factor and CoverGirl, in 2020 analyzed its entire cost structure with a zero-based approach and continues to use the budgeting tool, CFO Laurent Mercier said.</p><p>\"We are reviewing this, especially in the current environment, where things are changing all the time,\" Mr. Mercier said, adding that the company is speeding up its zero-based-budgeting efforts where possible. Coty is standardizing caps for fragrance bottles and simplifying cardboard packaging to lower costs as part of a $600 million, multiyear effort, he said.</p><p>Hershey</p><p>Reese's maker Hershey, based in Pennsylvania, regularly goes through every line of its profit and loss statement, finance chief Steve Voskuil said. \"It's even more important now with the inflationary environment to make sure we are thoughtful about how we manage the cost side,\" Mr. Voskuil said. The company reported operating costs of $1.92 billion for the quarter ended July 3, up from $1.53 billion a year earlier, S&amp;P said.</p><p>Hershey in recent years has invested in its production facilities, revamping 11 existing lines and adding 13 new ones. The production lines for its York peppermint patties can handle multiple pack sizes at once, which helps the company reduce downtime and operate more efficiently. Hershey said it uses ZBB to go through its budget and the company looks to save around $75 million every year with productivity measures. This year, however, the company won't hit that goal as it continues to deal with supply-chain issues, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Diageo</p><p>U.K.-based Diageo, which owns Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Baileys and other alcohol brands, generates annual productivity savings of around £400 million—equivalent to about $460 million—in part with the help of zero-based budgeting.</p><p>\"It's really become part of everyday management,\" CFO Lavanya Chandrashekar said. After drilling into its data, the company in recent quarters reduced the number of bottle sizes it orders from third-party suppliers, allowing it to churn out more product with the same capacity and meet consumer demand, Ms. Chandrashekar said. \"The big question was, how do we increase productivity per furnace hour?\" she said.</p><p>Diageo has developed various tools that help with decision making regarding where to invest, including spending on digital marketing. It also uses machine learning to analyze consumer trends on a granular basis. \"We're tracking this literally every day,\" Ms. Chandrashekar said.</p><p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</p><p>HPE, a provider of cloud-based IT solutions, started to apply zero-based budgeting when Tarek Robbiati became finance chief four years ago. The company's margins have improved in recent quarters, Mr. Robbiati said, pointing to efforts to keep a lid on discretionary costs. Still, operating expenses rose to $6.36 billion in the quarter ended July 31 from $6.3 billion a year earlier, according to S&amp;P.</p><p>\"Right now, the economic environment is very uncertain and more tilted towards the negative,\" Mr. Robbiati said, though he added that HPE continues to see strong customer demand.</p><p>Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>Zero-Based Budgeting Gains Clout as a Way for Companies to Find Savings</p>",
