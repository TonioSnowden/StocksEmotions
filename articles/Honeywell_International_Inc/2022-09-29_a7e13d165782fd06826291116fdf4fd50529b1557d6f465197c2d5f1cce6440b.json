  "title": "Supply-Chain Tech Startup Noodle.ai Gets Fresh Corporate Backing; Honeywell and ServiceNow venture arms invest in software company that finds ways to speed up product shipments",
  "text": "<p>Charlotte, N.C.-based Honeywell was drawn to Noodle.ai's potential to help the 116-year-old company optimize how it manages its assets, improve worker productivity and eliminate waste in its supply chain, said Honeywell Ventures Managing Director Patrick Hogan. Honeywell Ventures performed technical due diligence on Noodle.ai and, in general, seeks to become a customer of startups it invests in, Mr. Hogan added.</p><p>San Francisco-based Noodle.ai said its artificial intelligence draws on trillions of supply-chain data points to make recommendations on ways to speed up product shipments. Its system can detect patterns, like predicting when and where product shortages are occurring, that can help companies synchronize their interconnected supply chains.</p><p>Noodle.ai has customers in industries that rely on global supply chains, including in the food and beverage, metals and automotive sectors, and said its technology can help them navigate supply-chain snarls and bottlenecks better than older systems that have been in place for decades.</p><p>\"Extreme volatility requires much more advanced calculations,\" Noodle.ai founder and Chief Executive Stephen Pratt said.</p><p>While some supply-chain disruptions have eased this year, executives have said they would continue to work to improve logistics systems.</p><p>Noodle.ai started fundraising for the Series C round in February and closed the financing in July. Venture investors have pulled back this year on backing supply-chain tech startups after several years of pumping increasing amounts of capital into the sector. Such startups raised roughly $9 billion in the second quarter, down 39% from a year earlier, according to analytics firm CB Insights.</p><p>The number of deals getting done in the sector dropped to 243 last quarter, down 35% from a year earlier.</p><p>Noodle.ai is competing in a crowded part of the supply-chain tech sector, with several other well-funded startups offering similar or overlapping products and services. For instance, Chicago-based freight-visibility-software developer project44 has raised about $833 million in venture financing.</p><p>Noodle.ai has raised roughly $100 million since it was founded in 2016 and has tapped investors including TPG Growth, Dell Technologies Inc.'s venture-capital arm and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</p><p>Mr. Pratt said Noodle.ai has sought to raise capital from corporate venture units because they are also potential customers and can advise on how to add more clients.</p><p>\"We see many advantages in raising capital from strategic investors,\" Mr. Pratt said. \"We have had great success with Dell and Mitsubishi in previous rounds, so we decided to stick with this path.\"</p><p>Write to Marc Vartabedian at marc.vartabedian@wsj.com</p>",
