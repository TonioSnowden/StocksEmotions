Join the conversation below.</p><p>Spending on school security is poised to rise after a gunman in May killed 21 people at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, according to schools and security experts. Selling security products and services to the 130,000 schools in the U.S. has become a multibillion-dollar business, with greater interest every time there is another high-profile shooting.</p><p>President Biden signed a gun bill last month that included additional funding for school security. Several states have passed laws in recent years to tighten school security, including requirements and funding for security products. Florida and New Jersey are requiring schools to install panic alarms. Michigan passed a law allowing schools to use additional locking devices, following concern that local fire marshals could prevent their installation. More than 90% of U.S. schools now use security cameras, up from 60% in the 2009 school year.</p><p>Schools, including elementary schools, high schools and colleges, were projected to spend $3.1 billion on security equipment and services in 2021, according to the research firm Omdia, part of Informa PLC. The firm estimates that the market will grow by 8% a year as schools upgrade existing systems to add new technologies.</p><p>The Pocantico Hills Central School District in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., has spent more than $1 million over the past three years on strengthening security systems, said Superintendent Richard Calkins, aiming to reduce human error during security situations. The district upgraded all of its classroom doors to centrally controlled electronic locks and this summer is adding emergency alert screens to its hallways that can display fire and lockdown warnings.</p><p>\"The longer we are able to keep bad guys out, the safer we are able to keep our campus,\" Mr. Calkins said.</p><p>Honeywell and Allegion have introduced products that the companies said are being used by schools to reduce the impact of active shooters. A 3M distributor said he is seeing demand from schools for security films, which can make it more difficult for people to enter glass doors and windows.</p><p>Honeywell and other companies, including Alarm.com, have systems that automatically detect gunshots and then call police and lock doors. Alarm.com's Shooter Detection Systems said its sensors use audio and infrared indicators to sense gunshots and rule out similar noises such as slammed lockers or dropped books. </p><p>A Won-Door door at the company's corporate offices in Salt Lake City.

Mr. Bliesner said schools should focus first on basic steps such locking exterior doors and announcement systems that can be heard across the entire school.</p><p>\"I have 103 emails in my inbox this morning from vendors and manufacturers selling 'the one thing you need to make you safe,' \" he said.</p><p>For more than a decade, Taylor Brothers Doorlock LLC has sold locking systems aimed at preventing home invasions. After the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the Mt. Morris, Mich.-based company developed its Nightlock system for schools. It is designed for teachers or students to bar doors using an L-shaped metal piece and premounted door and floor plates.</p><p>In late November, when an attacker began firing a gun inside a hallway at Oxford High School in Oxford Township, Mich., students and teachers used the system to lock classroom doors, said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. \"The shooter never gained access to any of the classrooms,\" he said.</p><p>Four students were killed. A high-school student was arrested and has been charged with the shooting. He pleaded not guilty in January.</p><p>The Oxford Community Schools district paid around $50,000 for an initial set of Nightlock devices and their installation, according to the procurement database GovSpend, and now has 630 of the locks districtwide, the company said. They retail for $60 each.</p><p>Some groups founded by those affected by school attacks are pushing for districts to invest more in security systems and related equipment. Make Our Schools Safe wants states to pass \"Alyssa's Law,\" which requires schools to install alarms. Other such groups, such as March for Our Lives, are focused on other aspects of the security debate, such as making it hard to obtain weapons and investing in guidance counselors and mental-health resources for students.</p><p>Federal and state governments are funneling money to schools to invest in security. Around $1.7 billion in federal grants could potentially be used by school districts or communities to improve school safety, according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service. Other states have recurring or one-off funding for schools to invest in safety products. </p><p>Won-Door has increasingly focused on security products since the Sandy Hook shooting. PHOTO: Niki Chan Wylie for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Honeywell has a team that helps schools find and write grants to upgrade their security, such as for installing gunshot alarms. \"We need to take out that human delay,\" said Bruce Montgomery, who sells Honeywell security products to schools.</p><p>In Salt Lake City, more than 100 Won-Door Corp. factory workers are building hallway-size sliding doors meant for schools, airports and museums. Since the Sandy Hook shooting, the maker of metal, horizontally sliding fire doors has increasingly focused on security products, said Scott Smart, the company president. Doors designed to stop intruders now make up a third of its business, including in the new Sandy Hook elementary school.</p><p>\"We hope they just spend time beating on one of these doors,\" said Mr. Smart, referring to school intruders.</p><p>Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com</p><p>School Shootings Drive Sales of Locking Systems and Alarms</p>",
