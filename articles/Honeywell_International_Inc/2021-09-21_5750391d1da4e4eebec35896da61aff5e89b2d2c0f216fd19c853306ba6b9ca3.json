  "text": "<p>Honeywell at odds with asbestos trust. Honeywell International Inc. is locked in a standoff over asbestos payments with a bankruptcy trust that has accused the industrial conglomerate of \"bullying and extortionate tactics\" to settle injury liabilities for less than full value. Honeywell says it has evidence of \"severe and abusive mismanagement\" by the trust.</p><p>Staffing and trucking industry lender files bankruptcy. Flexible Funding LLC, which provides loans and alternative financing to trucking and temporary staffing businesses, has filed for bankruptcy, saying it has about 400 active clients and a portfolio of loans and factored receivables of about $110 million.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>States say Supreme Court should weigh Sackler family's bankruptcy deal. The state attorneys general for Washington and Connecticut said Sunday that the Supreme Court should have the opportunity to weigh a roughly $4.5 billion settlement between OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its Sackler family owners.</p><p>The states asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. to pause a ruling approving the deal pending their appeal. In general, appellate judges avoid overturning bankruptcy plans after they have gone into effect and money has been distributed to creditors.</p><p>The states said the deal should be paused so the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and ultimately the Supreme Court can consider the ruling. The states want the higher courts to weigh the merits of the settlement and its application of nonconsensual releases that will protect the Sacklers from civil opioid lawsuits regardless of whether states or private citizens agreed to the deal. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Stanford Ponzi scheme recoveries top $1 billion. The receiver tasked with digging up funds for victims of R. Allen Stanford's fraud surpassed $1 billion in recoveries, still just a fraction of the losses from the country's second-largest Ponzi scheme.</p><p>Stanford Financial Group investors are expected to collect roughly $600 million of that amount after legal fees and other expenses are paid, according to Kevin Sadler, an attorney for the receivership set up after Mr. Stanford's 2009 arrest.</p><p>Final recoveries for Mr. Stanford's victims could go higher, depending on the outcome of pending lawsuits against banks that did business with the fraudster's defunct financial group.</p><p>\"It's just an enormous challenge to start with next to nothing and you have a multi-billion dollar hole,\" Mr. Sadler said Friday. Investors lost roughly $7 billion in real money and nonexistent profits after Mr. Stanford was arrested, charged with running a Ponzi scheme out of a bank he owned in Antigua.</p><p>Nearly all the receivership's recoveries have come from litigation, Mr. Sadler said. It has lawsuits pending against Toronto-Dominion Bank and four other banks alleging they knew or should have known they were doing business with a fraudster. In addition, the receiver is trying to collect a $135 million judgment against Colorado billionaire Gary Magness, who is appealing. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>Distress</p><p>Financier behind DryShips stock's wild ride settles with SEC.
