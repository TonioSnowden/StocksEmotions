  "text": "<p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 62 points, or 0.2%, to 35,662, after setting a record intraday high at 35,765.02.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX index shed 10 points, or 0.2%, to reach 4,539, after carving out its all-time intraday peak at 4,555.05.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMPwas down 150 points, or 1%, at 15,065.</p><p>The large-cap Nasdaq-100 index was down 1% at 15,335, off 154 points.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow fell 6 points, or 0.02%, to 35,603, the S&amp;P 500 increased 14 points, or 0.3%, to a record 4,549.78, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 94 points, or 0.62%, to 15216.</p><p>For the week, the Dow was up 1%, the S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2%, the Nasdaq Composite was aiming for weekly gain of 1.9%, while the Nasdaq-100 was on track for a 1.3% gain, despite the day's decline.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>The U.S. equity market on Friday was facing pressure from selling in large-capitalization technology stocks, which was weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broad-market S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Quarterly results from Snapchat parent Snap Inc. SNAP late Thursday, which forecast a weaker-than-expected holiday season, prompted a decline in Internet and social-media related stocks, including Google-parent AlphabetGOOGL and Facebook Inc. FB.</p><p>Earlier in the session, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow traded in record territory but gains were already evaporating as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. labor market might reach “maximum employment” next year, possibly paving the way for interest rate hikes.</p><p>Those comments, made during a speech for the Bank for International Settlements, come as the Fed sees a serious risk of inflation expectations moving persistently higher, with other central bankers saying that it would use its tools to bring inflation in line with the annual 2% target hoped for by policy makers.</p><p>Powell's remarks come ahead of a media blackout period for Fed officials until its next rate-setting meeting, which is scheduled for Nov. 2-3.</p><p>Still, bullishness on Wall Street has appeared to be durable after the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday logged its first record closing high since Sept. 2., with the Dow set to mark its first record finish since Aug. 16 if gains hold through to Friday's close.</p><p>A largely upbeat earnings reporting season has pushed the indexes up this week, though worries over inflation, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and troubles for China's economy remain a nag.

He also said he may alter or eliminate the filibuster to protect voting rights, and would consider using the National Guard to unclog the supply chains.</p><p>In economic reports, IHS Markit's survey of senior business executives in service-oriented companies rebounded to a three-month high of 58.2 from 54.9 in September.
