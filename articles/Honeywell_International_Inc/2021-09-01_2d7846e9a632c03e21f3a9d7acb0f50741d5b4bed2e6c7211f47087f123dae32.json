  "text": "<p>Dear readers,&#xa0;</p> <p>Lex wrote last week about the unstoppable rollout of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fee076d5-045b-41f0-8550-ebd8039a3a92\">smart speakers</a>, now glowing in the corners of millions of kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms worldwide. A number of readers replied that they were so fond of their Echo/Portal/Nest that they had installed multiple smart speakers at home. A few suggested that voice tech felt as if it was on the cusp of being far more widely used.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is certainly plenty of optimism about the potential for voice tech. Potential uses for sophisticated, artificial intelligence-driven conversational voice tech are varied. These include online learning, customer support, gaming and marketing. Lockheed Martin recently announced that pilots training to fly the F-35 Lightning II aircraft will be guided by a ReadSpeaker <a href=\"https://www.airforce-technology.com/news/lockheed-martin-readspeaker-technology-f-35-training/\">artificial voice</a> so that they can concentrate on flying and won't have to look at a written manual while in the cockpit.&#xa0;</p> <p>Anyone who has struggled to get the voice assistant on their smart speaker to understand simple commands may wonder how comfortable they would feel relying on voice tech while flying a jet. Nevertheless, voice-controlled aircraft are in development. Honeywell Aerospace engineers are working on cockpit systems that respond to voice command as part of plans to create fully autonomous aircraft in the next 30 years. </p> <p>According to Pew research, people like using voice assistants because it frees up their hands. This explains why the tech has so many potential applications in medicine. Earlier this year, Microsoft purchased conversational AI company Nuance Communications in a huge $19.7bn deal, a decision prompted in part by Nuance's work in healthcare. Its speech recognition, chat bots and natural language processing are used by 500,000 clinicians.</p> <p>Audio is central to the way many of us communicate. It builds trust and encourages collaboration. Most of us can speak faster than we write. We may be able to explain ourselves more clearly and with more nuance too. Yet the internet has so far prioritised text and images.&#xa0;</p> <p>This has begun to shift with the rise of audio social media and so-called Unified Communications as a Service — a concept that one provider can provide video and audio, messaging and all other communications. Conversational AI is not necessary for this model, but it might be one day.&#xa0;</p> <p>Efforts to make AI-driven voice tech more central tend to hit up against two perennial problems: poor comprehension and responses that sound strange. You can check out the latest attempts at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbfcFy1OEg\">Voice Conversion Challenge</a>, which compares voice conversion systems built around the world.</p> <p>As conversational AI sounds more natural, the next step is personalisation. US synthetic speech company LOVO has just raised $4.5m in series A funding to develop voices that it says will touch “hearts and emotions”. Its aim is to build different “voice skins” for company AI voice assistants, to make them more personal. Customers include South Korea's Shinhan Bank, according to a report from TechCrunch.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>At the more fantastical end of the voice tech revolution is the idea of creating conversations with people who cannot speak at all. Actor Val Kilmer had difficulty talking following treatment for throat cancer some years ago. He has worked with Sonatic to create an AI voice platform that adapts <a href=\"https://www.sonantic.io/blog/helping-actor-val-kilmer-reclaim-his-voice\">words recorded</a> by his son.&#xa0;James Vlahos, co-founder of HereAfter AI, created a chatbot using his father's voice after he died. </p> <p>These are niche applications. There is a much wider hinterland of commercial possibilities if only machines could be painfully taught what people do so naturally — understand the human voice.</p> <p>Enjoy your week. </p> <p><strong>Elaine Moore</strong> <br>Deputy head of Lex </p><p>Source: Elaine Moore 2021 'Lex Midweek Letter: voice tech heeds the call ' FT.com 1 September.
