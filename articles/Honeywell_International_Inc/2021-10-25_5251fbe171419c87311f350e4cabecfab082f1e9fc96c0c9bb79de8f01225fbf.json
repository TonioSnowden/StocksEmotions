  "text": "<p>Accordingly, it came as little surprise to me that Digital World Acquisition DWAC exploded after it announced a deal with an entity called Trump Media &amp; Technology Group.&#xa0; Obviously, a 1,274.7% gain in just two days is unprecedented and a sign that Trump's supporters believe that his new social media platform will be a big success.&#xa0;</p><p>The other company that went parabolic, surging 1,289.5%, was Phunware Inc. PHUN, which helped Donald Trump's re-election campaign in 2020.</p><p>Read:Phunware stock was up 1,000% on Friday. What the heck is Phunware?</p><p>While I support Donald Trump and have confidence in his abilities, I am less certain that his brand will translate into stock-market successes at this stage.&#xa0;</p><p>Remember, enthusiasm is no substitute for fundamentals, and both companies are short on them.&#xa0; Here's some salient facts that investors should heed.&#xa0;</p><p>First, in the case of DWAC, the deal is not yet complete.&#xa0; It's simply been announced.&#xa0; Wall Street is littered with deals that never happened.&#xa0; Aetna never merged with Humana, T-Mobile got away from AT&amp;T and GE's $60 billion run at Honeywell fell apart.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Could Trump Media &amp; Technology and its TRUTH app fail to reach an agreement with Digital World Acquisition Corp.?&#xa0; In a word, yes.&#xa0;</p><p>Second, there's no earnings here to adequately value either company on.&#xa0; Sometimes the most fundamental tenant of stock-market investing gets lost in the shuffle.&#xa0; That is, the markets run on earnings.&#xa0; And in the absence of earnings, sometimes, but not always, financial forecasts are used as a proxy.&#xa0; In the case of the proposed DWAC merger, there are neither earnings or forecasts for investors to hang their hat on. &#xa0;And in the case of PHUN, the company has never produced a profit.&#xa0;</p><p>Third, while PHUN might benefit from a 2024 bid by Trump, DWAC could be stalled by a run, and would face, literally, unprecedented challenges if Trump won the presidency.&#xa0; In the words of Rumsfeld, there is an abundance of known unknowns.&#xa0;</p><p>Fourth, the $293 million that DWAC will have at its disposal&#xa0; once a merger is consummated is an impressive number, but it is ultimately relegated to David/Goliath proportions compared to the billions and billions in cash sitting on the balance sheets of would-be competitors TwitterTWTR and FacebookFB.&#xa0; &#xa0;</p><p>Finally, investors should keep in mind that hedge funds are gonna hedge.&#xa0; The hedge funds behind Digital World Acquisition Corp., namely D.E. Shaw, Saba Capital Management, Highbridge Capital Management and Palm Beach-based Lighthouse Investment Partners will not be able to help themselves, and I guarantee you that they will be selling stock as soon as the restrictions on their Digital World Acquisition Corp. shares are lifted.&#xa0;</p><p>Let's face it, where else can you make over 1,000% for your hedge-fund clients this quickly?&#xa0; And even if they could help themselves, their fiduciary duty to these clients makes a flood of new shares onto the market a pre-ordained event.&#xa0;</p><p>Wall Street is a manic crowd and this mania was on full display with Digital World Acquisition Corp. and Phunware last week.&#xa0; If the supposedly smart money, like D.E. Shaw, Saba Capital Management, Highbridge Capital Management and Lighthouse Investment Partners, are going to be selling DWAC, I recommend that you stay out of their way and avoid both DWAC and PHUN for now.</p><p>Louis Navellier is chairman and chief investment officer for Navellier &amp; Associates.&#xa0;</p><p>Now read:Anthony Scaramucci is rooting for DWAC because he thinks it will keep Donald Trump from running in 2024</p><p>Barron's:Want to Play the Trump SPAC? Consider the Warrants.</p>",
