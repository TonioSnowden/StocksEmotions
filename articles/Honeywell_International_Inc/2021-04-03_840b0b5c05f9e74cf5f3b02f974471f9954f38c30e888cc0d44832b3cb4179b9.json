  "text": "<p>Pro Act inclusion in the infrastructure plan is making a proposal with lukewarm left-wing support more palatable to some. The Working Families Party criticized the Biden plan as falling \"too short\" to meet the needs of the moment but highlighted inclusion of the Pro Act for affirming \"the president's commitment to workers' right to organize.\" The WFP and other progressive organizations plan to hold over 100 events around the country encouraging moderate Democrats to support the proposal</p><p>It's an open question whether the Pro Act can even be included in a package that goes through the Senate reconciliation process.</p><p>Inclusion of the Pro Act is anathema to most Republicans as well as many interest groups who are broadly in favor of more infrastructure spending.</p><p>A BIPARTISAN CLIMATE treaty? The Biden administration will soon send the Kigali Amendment, a global climate treaty that bans the use of hydrofluorocarbons in products like air conditioners, to the Senate for consideration. The treaty is unusual in that it's a climate pledge supported by the industrial titans it would most affect, like Honeywell International Inc. and Carrier Global Corp. The broad agreement makes it possible for the Senate to reach the treaty threshold of 67 votes -- a rare feat for any treaty and an impossibility for most global climate agreements. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement was crafted specifically to avoid treaty-like language since the Obama administration and international climate negotiators saw no chance of it being ratified by a Republican-controlled Senate.</p><p>Legislation with almost identical language to the Kigali Amendment was included in a budget deal in the last Congress as a result of an agreement between Republican Sens. John Barrasso and John Kennedy and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper. Thirteen Senate Republicans signed a 2018 letter urging the Trump administration to submit the treaty for ratification.</p><p>But given that the U.S. has committed itself to the goals of the treaty on its own, multilateralism skeptics among Senate Republicans may be reluctant to hitch their wagons to a global climate deal.</p><p>FEDERAL RESEARCH FUNDS for the development of remdesivir, the first drug authorized to fight Covid-19, totaled $162 million, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office. But despite that investment, the funding won't result in any government patent rights because the federally supported research \"did not generate new inventions,\" the report says. Congressional Democrats asked the GAO to probe the issue in January, noting that Gilead Sciences Inc., which makes the drug, charges hundreds of dollars per vial for it.</p><p>INDIANA REPUBLICANS gave former Vice President Mike Pence an unwelcome nudge with a state Senate resolution that thanked Pence, a former governor and congressman, for his years of service and wished him the best in his \"retirement.\" Pence himself has given no indication that he plans to leave politics.</p><p>MINOR MEMOS: Lawyer accidentally calls Justice Clarence Thomas \"Mr. Chief Justice\" during Supreme Court arguments; Chief Justice John Roberts says the job isn't open . . . Officials including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Maryland Rep. Andy Harris take political \"pressing the flesh\" to the next level, administering coronavirus vaccines to constituents themselves . . . Sen. Tammy Baldwin encourages people to listen to recordings of her voice to help them meditate or calm down.</p>",
