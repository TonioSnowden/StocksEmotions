  "title": "The Molding of a Manufacturing CEO; Revathi Advaithi, the boss of Flex Ltd., rose to the top of her industry with encouragement from some influential advisers. One asked: 'Why aren't you a CEO?'",
  "text": "<p>* Age: 54</p><p>* Education: Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. M.B.A. from Thunderbird School of Global Management</p><p>* Family: husband Jeevan, 21-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter</p><p>* First Job: Sales engineer for Xerox in India</p><p>* Favorite Book: \"Team of Rivals\" by Doris Kearns Goodwin</p><p>* Time alarm clock goes off on weekdays: 5 a.m. (but she usually wakes up naturally at 4:30 a.m.)</p><p>* Where did you grow up? All over India</p><p>* Management Mantra: See the forest through the trees</p><p>* Stress reliever: Mystery books and organizing</p><p>* Favorite snack: Pulparindo, a Mexican tamarind snack</p><p>* Worst advice ever received: During communications training for an executive role, she was told as a woman she should look more polished and her hair should be perfectly \"coiffed.\" Male executives, she said, weren't given the same grooming advice.</p><p>The prediction came true in 2019 when she became the boss of Flex Ltd., which employs more than 160,000 and makes everything from coffee makers to respirators. Now the 54-year-old CEO is helping the manufacturing and logistics firm navigate a complex supply chain crisis, the pandemic and a war in Ukraine, where Flex has employees.</p><p>\"When it comes to crises, I'm very hands on,\" she said. \"I think that's part of just my DNA. Maybe that's the engineer in me.\"</p><p>Her rise in the manufacturing world started when she moved to the United States from India for graduate school at the University of Oklahoma in her mid-20s. A career fair there led to a job with power management company Eaton Corp., where she joined its operations management development program and became a shop floor supervisor.</p><p>Eventually she was asked to turn around Eaton's hydraulics business in Europe. At the time she was pregnant with her first child; her water broke while on stage during an all-employee meeting. She finished her comments, answered questions and then went to the hospital.</p><p>Later she ran the Asia Pacific Business for Eaton Electrical in Shanghai, integrated a major acquisition in the U.S. and ultimately became chief operating officer of Eaton's electrical sector, overseeing tens of thousands of employees. \"There I probably finally saw, OK, maybe I do get to the c-suite,\" she said.</p><p>Some people she values for their advice and guidance helped convince her it was possible. While she was COO of Eaton's electrical sector, one of them asked her: \"Why aren't you a CEO?\"</p><p>Here are her four of her most trusted advisers: </p><p>Sandy Cutler, Kathy Mazzarella, Scott Trezise, Roger Carr </p><p>Sandy Cutler</p><p>former chairman and CEO of Eaton Corp.</p><p>Ms. Advaithi met Mr. Cutler about a week into her job at Eaton as one of about a dozen people in a training program selected to have lunch with the CEO. They were served steak, mashed potatoes and green beans, so Ms. Advaithi, then a vegetarian, picked at the potatoes.</p><p>Mr. Cutler, sensing something was wrong, asked the staff to bring her a vegetarian meal and suggested everyone wait until she was served.</p><p>\"People talk about empathy these days,\" she said. \"Just having that moment where he understood had a huge influence in my life.\"</p><p>During her time at Eaton, Mr. Cutler taught her that good turnarounds take about two years, a company constantly needs to evolve and \"there'll be no role where you think you finish the job,\" she said. </p><p>Kathy Mazzarella</p><p>CEO and chairman of Graybar Electric Company Inc., corporate board member</p><p>Ms. Mazzarella started out as one of Ms. Advaithi's biggest—and toughest —customers at Eaton. Their discussions often took place at the Saint Louis Club in Clayton, Mo., where Ms. Mazzarella proved to be a shrewd negotiator.</p><p>The two stayed in touch, and Ms. Mazzarella was one of the first calls Ms. Advaithi received when she was named CEO of Flex. The two later had dinner, where Ms. Mazzarella shared advice about how to be a successful CEO.</p><p>\"She said: 'This role is going to take a toll and you have to think about what are you going to do about yourself,'\" Ms. Advaithi said. \"I did not understand the magnitude of that when she first talked to me but I have revisited that so many times over.\"</p><p>Ms. Advaithi said Ms. Mazzarella will call her out of the blue and ask \"Are you doing anything for yourself?\" especially as she's worked through a range of challenging situations since starting the role. \"It is a lonely job at the end of the day and you have to find ways to keep your sanity through it,\" Ms. Advaithi said. </p><p>Scott Trezise</p><p>chief human resources officer of Lumen Technologies Inc.</p><p>It was Mr. Trezise who first told Ms. Advaithi she would be a CEO someday. They met during a career fair decades ago at the University of Oklahoma. Mr. Trezise, then working for Eaton, hired Ms. Advaithi for an operations management development program job and the two have stayed in close touch.</p><p>Mr. Trezise also hired Ms. Advaithi at Honeywell in the early 2000s, encouraging her to see how another company worked at high levels as it went through a leadership change.</p><p>Ms. Advaithi said Mr. Trezise is the person she calls for advice, whether working through a challenge related to people, an organization or her own career. As Ms. Advaithi brought in new executives to the Flex leadership team over the past few years, he helped her navigate matters like the hiring of new people and finding a good balance.</p><p>Since Ms. Advaithi has often taken on roles where she isn't an expert in the specific business, she's focused on bringing in people who are—part of the advice she's gleaned from Mr. Trevise over the years. \"You have to have people who know the business that you can lean on and listen to,\" she said. </p><p>Roger Carr</p><p>chairman of BAE Systems PLC</p><p>When Ms. Advaithi met with different boards to take on her first director role several years ago, she realized BAE Systems was the right match because of Mr. Carr, she said. She was struck by how he led the board, especially making sure voices were heard but not necessarily dominating meetings.</p><p>\"From him I really learned the art of navigating a board,\" she said. \"He made sure that the board's role was clearly setting direction and helping the team but not being in the day to day.\"</p><p>Ms. Advaithi was on the BAE Systems board until summer 2020 and then joined the Uber Technologies Inc. board, where she still serves. She's also a member of the Flex board.</p><p>Mr. Carr has also helped Ms. Advaithi in her career path. When she was figuring out her next steps from her time as chief operating officer of Eaton's electrical sector, Mr. Carr convinced her she should lead a company, asking her: \"'Why aren't you a CEO?'\"</p><p>Mr. Carr \"was very influential in me thinking that I could,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com</p><p>The Molding of a Manufacturing CEO</p>",
