  "title": "Airlines Join White House Effort for Cleaner Jet Fuel; Biden administration plans to put up $4.3 billion to lower jet-fuel emissions by 20%",
  "text": "<p>Airlines for America, a trade group for U.S. air carriers and shippers, has agreed to collaborate with the federal government and raise its own targets for using lower-emissions energy. Their goal is to find a commercially viable fuel that is better for the environment, and have 3 billion gallons available of it to U.S. carriers by 2030, according to the White House. U.S. airlines used 18.3 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2019.</p><p>Several of their members have announced their own plans to spend millions of dollars on helping to develop so-called sustainable aviation fuel or have promised to buy such fuel. Those projects include partnerships between Southwest Airlines Co. and the Energy Department; United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Honeywell International Inc.; and Delta Air Lines Inc., Chevron Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>The White House said it would be committing research-and-development money as part of the project, prioritizing cleaner jet fuel with agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration. The largest chunk, $3 billion, is slated to come from the Energy Department in loan guarantees.</p><p>The White House is also touting President Biden's history of support for a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel, which would need approval by Congress. It would cut costs and help rapidly boost domestic production, according to the White House.</p><p>\"These steps will help make progress toward our climate goals for 2030 and are essential to unlocking the potential for a fully zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050,\" the White House said in a fact sheet about the initiative.</p><p>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com</p><p>Airlines Join White House Effort for Cleaner Jet Fuel</p>",
