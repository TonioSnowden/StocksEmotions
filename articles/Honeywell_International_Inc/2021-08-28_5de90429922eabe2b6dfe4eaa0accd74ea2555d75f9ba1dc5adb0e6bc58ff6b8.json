He had financial oversight over Walmart's health and wellness business for a period of time, WBA said.</p><p>Before Walmart, Mr. Gruener worked at Sears Holdings Corp., Ernst &amp; Young and Honeywell International Inc. In his new role, he will report to WBA's global finance chief, James Kehoe.</p><p>Mr. Gruener succeeds former Walgreens CFO Jeremy Kunicki, who left the company in the spring after about 20 years in various positions. Mr. Kunicki on March 1 became finance chief at cannabis firm Parallel.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance's U.S. business -- which brought in about 85% of the company's total sales of $34 billion in the quarter ended May 31 -- last month said it has seen a boost to its business from Covid-19 vaccines. U.S. sales rose to $28.7 billion in the quarter, up 5.1% compared with the prior-year period.</p><p>Walgreens has administered more than 28 million Covid-19 vaccinations, it said earlier this month, and expects more demand for its inoculation services due to surging Delta-variant cases.
