As he continues to fail, people will lose their fear and he will lose his power,” Sonnenfeld wrote.</p><p>He said in an MSNBC interview early Wednesday that the goal is “to create some hardship on the Russian economy” and to shatter Putin's self-image as “in control of all sectors.”</p><p>Sonnenfeld said that one might normally expect that consumer-facing companies would be the first to express distaste for Putin's actions — those sorts of companies have been most active in speaking out against U.S. states' new limitations on voting rights and in favor of gun-safety legislation, the Yale professor observed — but heavier-industry companies have of late been on the front foot.</p><p>Ask the Dow (April 2021):Here's what the 30 Dow industrials companies are saying about new voting restrictions</p><p>One factor for consumer-oriented brands is gauging how they'll successfully re-enter the Russian market when the time comes, Sonnenfeld told MSNBC's “Morning Joe” program, assuming the Russian consumer base continues to have “its news filtered by Pravda, you know, and TASS.”</p><p>See:Russia intensifies crackdown on independent media</p><p>Also:After years of living in Moscow, I have bad news: No one should expect the Russian people to suddenly rise up against Putin now</p><p>Among the companies that are still in Russia, confectionery group Mars has more than $2 billion in investments, and Pirelli makes 10% of its tires there.</p><p>The list of companies that have withdrawn from Russia or curtailed their business there is longer, at more than 200, and includes big hitters Alphabet Inc. GOOGLGOOG, American Express Co. AXP, Apple Inc. AAPL, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, Walt Disney Co. DIS, IBM Corp. IBM and Netflix Inc.
