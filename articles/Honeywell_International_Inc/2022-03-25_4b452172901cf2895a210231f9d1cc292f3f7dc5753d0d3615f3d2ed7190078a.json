  "title": "China Plane Crash: What to Know About the Boeing 737 Wreck Where Rescuers Found No Survivors; The 737-800 is one of the workhorses of the commercial aviation industry and has one of the best safety records",
  "text": "<p>We don't know yet why China Eastern Flight 5735 crashed, and it could be some time before we do; crash investigations often take months or years. Investigators usually try to find and analyze the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, commonly referred to as black boxes, to help gain insights into a flight's final moments. They are likely to also examine the debris from the crash and videos of the plane's nosedive and look for any possible clues in the aircraft's maintenance record, among other pieces of evidence.</p><p>Rescuers have so far recovered one of the black boxes, made by Honeywell International Inc., which had a badly damaged exterior. Authorities said they believe it is the cockpit voice recorder.</p><p>It is rare for planes to crash once they have reached their cruising altitude, as this flight had, aviation-safety experts say.</p><p>\"Once they're at cruising altitude, generally aircraft don't crash. Most accidents occur on the landing and takeoff phase of flight,\" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety and insurance at aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium.</p><p>Aviation-safety consultant John Cox said there isn't yet enough evidence to start eliminating any possible causes.</p><p>\"Everything is on the table right now. The descent profile is very unusual,\" he said.</p><p>China's aviation regulator will lead the investigation, and the National Transportation Safety Board has appointed a senior air-safety investigator as a U.S. representative, the NTSB said. Representatives from Boeing Co., engine maker CFM International (a joint venture between General Electric Co. and France's Safran SA) and the Federal Aviation Administration will serve as technical advisers. That is typical in the event a Boeing plane crashes outside the U.S.</p><p>The FAA said it is ready to assist in investigation efforts if asked.</p><p>A senior official with China Eastern told reporters at a news briefing the day after the crash that the plane was in good working order and the crew was qualified and in good health at the time of departure.</p><p>Zhu Tao, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, on Thursday said basic information about the incident has been submitted, as required, to the International Civil Aviation Organization and to the NTSB. Mr. Zhu said relevant parties would be invited to take part in the investigation after that process begins, adding that authorities were still focusing on search-and-rescue efforts and in the early evidence-gathering stage of the probe.</p><p>The NTSB, which investigates aviation and other accidents, was trying to secure Chinese approval Wednesday to expedite their entry into the country, U.S. officials said.</p><p>On Friday, officials in China said they had dispatched 7,280 rescue workers and more than 200 vehicles to assist in the search efforts so far.</p><p>What do we know about the people aboard?</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. Rescue teams began combing through the wreckage the day after the crash and said they have found no survivors. If everyone onboard is confirmed dead, it would mark China's deadliest crash in nearly three decades.</p><p>Sun Shiying, a senior China Eastern official, said the nine crew members on the flight were in good health and that their experience levels met official requirements.</p><p>Preliminary findings showed no foreign nationals were on the plane, said Wang Wenbin, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman. Passengers on the flight included the chief financial officer of Dinglong Culture Co., a, a Shenzhen-listed company based in Guangzhou whose businesses include entertainment and titanium-ore mining, as well as two people who worked for Zhongxinghua Certified Public Accountants LLP, a Beijing-based accounting firm with offices across the country.</p><p>Who were the pilots?</p><p>One of the most experienced commercial pilots in China was in the cockpit during the flight, along with a younger aviator. China Eastern hasn't disclosed their names, but a senior executive for the airline recently said both the men at the controls when flight MU5735 went down had sufficient flying experience and always performed well.</p><p>Phoenix Weekly, a magazine run by a state-controlled television broadcaster, identified the captain as Yang Hongda and the first officer as Zhang Zhengping.</p><p>Mr. Zhang was among the first pilots trained to fly commercial aircraft in China in the early years of the country's post-Mao reform era, according to a 2018 profile of him published by the aviation industry's official newspaper. By the time of the profile, Mr. Zhang had logged more than 30,000 hours of flying time and trained more than 100 captains for China Eastern.</p><p>Mr. Yang, according to the Phoenix Weekly report, was one of Mr. Zhang's trainees. China Eastern's inflight magazine previously identified Mr. Yang as one of the youngest captains in the airline's Yunnan branch, and said he wanted to follow his pilot father's footsteps into the cockpit since childhood.</p><p>Airline officials have said there were two co-pilots on the plane, and that the second co-pilot was an observer on board to gain experience, a practice they said was in line with regulations.</p><p>What kind of plane was it?</p><p>The plane was a Boeing 737-800. That is an older-generation model than the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes. The MAX hasn't resumed commercial flying in China.</p><p>The 737-800 is one of the workhorses of the commercial aviation industry, with roughly 4,200 in service world-wide. It is the most popular of the 737 NG family of jets, which has one of the best safety records in commercial aviation. For the 737 NG family, fatal accidents in which the aircraft is damaged beyond repair have been relatively rare, with 0.09 such events per million departures over the course of almost 25 years in operation, according to a safety study of aircraft accidents through 2020 published by Boeing in September.</p><p>The plane involved in the crash Monday was relatively new. It first flew in June 2015.</p><p>China Eastern grounded the rest of its 737-800 fleet after the crash. Other airlines around the world continue to fly the jet.</p><p>What was the plane's itinerary?</p><p>The flight crashed about an hour and seven minutes into its journey from the southwestern city of Kunming to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou.</p><p>After climbing to an altitude of 29,100 feet, the jet cruised for 12 minutes at a speed of roughly 455 knots, or 524 miles an hour, according to Flightradar24 data. At 2:20 p.m. local time, its nose suddenly angled toward the ground.</p><p>The jet then plummeted from the sky, reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet a minute. It plunged more than 20,000 feet, to an altitude of 7,425 feet, then managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again nose diving toward the mountain, the data shows. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 feet, less than two minutes after entering the dive.</p><p>A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China told reporters at a news briefing Tuesday evening that air-traffic controllers tried several times to hail the jet after they saw its altitude drop sharply, but didn't get a response.</p><p>What is China's air-safety record?</p><p>China sharply improved its air-safety record after a series of fatal airplane crashes in the 1990s. In 1994, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M operated by China Northwest Airlines, which has since merged with China Eastern, crashed on its way from the city of Xi'an to Guangzhou, killing all 160 people aboard.</p><p>The most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline happened in August 2010, when a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA and operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people aboard.</p><p>China Eastern, based in Shanghai, had gone more than 17 years without a fatal accident before Monday.</p><p>What is the impact on Boeing?</p><p>The crash comes at a precarious time for Boeing in China, with the plane maker working to revive its standing in the key aviation market after years navigating the fallout of the MAX crisis and a China-U. S. trade war. China Eastern grounded its entire fleet of 737-800 aircraft in response, affecting some 224 in-service aircraft across the airline group, according to aviation consulting firm Cirium.</p><p>China has been an increasingly important market for Boeing as the country rapidly built up its aviation industry over the past three decades. The company has delivered 1,736 jets to China, according to Boeing's own data, with 143 more on order. Boeing believes there is far more to come. It forecasts that China will buy 8,700 new jetliners—from all suppliers, but chiefly from Boeing and Airbus SE—over the next two decades, accounting for nearly a fifth of global demand.</p><p>Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun last year said the company needed new orders from China's airlines to compete as air travel recovers quickly from the pandemic. The U.S. plane maker hasn't secured a new jetliner order from China in more than four years.</p><p>Mr. Calhoun, in a message to staff on Monday evening, said the company is closely communicating with China Eastern and regulatory authorities following the crash. \"Trust that we will be doing everything we can to support our customer and the accident investigation during this difficult time,\" he said.</p><p>Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.</p><p>This article might be updated.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>China Plane Crash: What to Know About the Boeing 737 Wreck Where Rescuers Found No Survivors</p>",
