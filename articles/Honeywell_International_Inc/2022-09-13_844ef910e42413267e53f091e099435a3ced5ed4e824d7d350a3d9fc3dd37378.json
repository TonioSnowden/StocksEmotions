  "text": "<p>An Army spokesman said that as of Tuesday it had 59% of its Chinook fleet available for missions and training across the globe. He said in a statement that more Chinooks were returning to service daily as the Army reviews records and performs maintenance checks.</p><p>American Chinooks have carried troops and equipment since their debut in the 1960s. At least some of the recent engine fires involved the MH-47 variant that is specially modified to carry out special operations, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported. The helicopters are manufactured by Boeing Co., while Honeywell International Inc. produces their engines.</p><p>The Army has said the engine incidents resulted in no injuries, and the parts in question, types of seals known as O-rings, weren't faulty, just not the ones that were supposed to be installed. The military branch said it has taken steps to correct the maintenance error and inspect helicopters suspected of having the incorrect O-rings.</p><p>Write to Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Army Chinooks Return to Service Following Grounding</p>",
