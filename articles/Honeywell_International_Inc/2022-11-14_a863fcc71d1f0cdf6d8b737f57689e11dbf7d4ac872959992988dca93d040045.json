  "title": "Alternative Energy (A Special Report) --- Smart Thermostats Can Reduce Energy Use -- but Not if People Take Away the Smart Part: A study finds consumers override the settings so often, they end up using just as much or even more energy",
  "text": "<p>In partnership with Honeywell International Inc. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the researchers recruited 1,385 households in northern and central California to participate in the study. Participants were split into a group that received free installation of a Honeywell smart thermostat and a control group thatkept their existing thermostats. The researchers then evaluated the effect of the smart thermostats on energy consumption across an 18-month period.</p><p>In addition to the overall effect, the team studied energy use at specific times and in particular circumstances -- days of the week, the hottest and coldest days, peak-energy-consumption times of day. \"The overall pattern is that energy use in the smart-thermostat group isn't different from the control,\" says Christopher Clapp, one of the researchers and an assistant instructional professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago who specializes in environmental microeconomics.</p><p>Dr. Clapp and his colleagues attribute the overall lack of energy savings from smart thermostats to users who frequently override the thermostats' settings, which is easily done with a tap on a smartphone. \"We see that when people override settings, they tend to use more energy, because they are not optimizing for energy usage, which was the prediction in the labs, but for comfort,\" Dr. Clapp says.</p><p>Dr. Clapp says he isn't suggesting that people not use smart thermostats. But, he says, if they really want to see savings, they need to use these devices the way engineers intended -- to minimize energy use -- and not override the settings to give immediate comfort.</p><p>\"It's important not to rely only on the manufacturers' own research\" when assessing the energy-saving potential of any device, he says. \"We can't just assume that these products will have the effects they claim to have.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.
