  "text": "<p>A breakthrough infection isn't likely to land you in the hospital, though it is highly concerning for offices filled with colleagues who might be pregnant or have young children currently ineligible for the vaccine as well as for those with family members who are elderly or immunocompromised.</p><p>What can you do to protect yourself and others in the workplace? First, get the vaccine, doctors and researchers say. Then block the virus particles with a well-fitting, leakproof mask and do whatever you can to ventilate or filter the air around your desk.</p><p>Change your commute</p><p>Be ready to adjust how you get to work. If you can, aerosol scientists say, avoid taking trains or buses at peak times. In a car, taxi or ride-hailing vehicle, crack the windows by about an inch.</p><p>Make sure the driver isn't recirculating the air, said Donald K. Milton, professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Recirculating air, which is typically marked by a sideways U-shaped-arrow button in the car, can keep pollution out but the virus in.</p><p>Wear a mask that fits</p><p>Since the Delta variant is so contagious, your mask should fit tightly enough so that air doesn't escape around your nose and cheeks. It should have a nose bridge and ideally two loops that fit around the back of your head instead of your ears, said Dr. Alex Huffman, a professor at the University of Denver and an aerosol expert.</p><p>Covid-19 is transmitted not just by droplets expelled by people coughing and sneezing but also by tiny aerosol particles that can linger in the air and travel on air currents far beyond 6 feet, according to the CDC. That is why a good mask and good ventilation—which adds fresh air to a room—are important, scientists say. The mask can block the virus; the fresh air can reduce its concentration.</p><p>Office HVAC systems were designed to control temperature and humidity and to conserve energy, not to filter viruses or keep people healthy, said Manish Sharma, chief technology officer at Honeywell Building Technologies, who is working with schools to upgrade their ventilation. Many were designed only to bring in enough fresh air to replace what leaks outside through doors and windows—not to reduce concentration of a virus like Covid-19, he said.</p><p>Ask WSJ: What to Expect When You're Expecting a Return to the Office</p><p>Join Wall Street Journal technology columnist Christopher Mims, Work &amp; Life columnist Rachel Feintzeig and reporter Chip Cutter for a conversation about what to expect as we look toward office returns.</p><p>* Live Q&amp;A | Begins 2 p.m. EDT Sept. 8</p><p>\"One of the problems with a lot of indoor spaces is there really isn't good air mix,\" said Dr. Milton. \"That means your exhaled breath and everybody else's is hanging in a cloud right around your breathing zone.\"</p><p>This means you will probably need to upgrade your mask. Cloth masks, which aren't engineered to filter air pollution or aerosols, don't provide as much protection against Covid-19 as N95s or other masks made with synthetic fibers, said John Volckens, professor of environmental health and an aerosol scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colo.</p><p>In a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology in February, he and other scientists found that while cloth masks did a fairly good job of trapping the virus you exhale, they provide little protection to the wearer from inhaled aerosols that are much smaller. If you opt for a cloth mask at the office, he recommends wearing it over a surgical mask.</p><p>BYO air filter</p><p>Opening office windows and adding fans have been shown in some studies to reduce the concentration of the virus. Fans should be placed so they don't blow potentially contaminated air from one person in the direction of another, according to the CDC. The agency suggests a window fan that sucks air out of the indoor space.</p><p>However, many office buildings' windows don't open. Another option, aerosol and environmental health scientists say, is to ask your employer to get free-standing air purifiers with HEPA, or \"high-efficiency particulate air,\" filters that are frequently in hospitals and on airplanes. Otherwise, aerosol scientists recommend getting a portable filter to place on your desk.</p><p>HEPA filters trap contaminants pulled in by purifiers before pushing clean air back out and are 99.97% efficient at filtering particles that Dr. Volckens said would include the virus.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If you are heading back to the office this fall, what steps will you take to stay healthy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>One way to gauge the robustness of your office ventilation is with a CO2 monitor that measures the carbon dioxide expelled when people exhale. Since it is difficult and expensive to measure respiratory aerosols like Covid-19, measuring CO2 is a good proxy for indoor ventilation, scientists say.</p><p>If the level is 600 parts CO2 per million molecules of air, \"the ventilation is doing an excellent job of keeping up with the emissions from the people in the room,\" said Dr. Huffman, the University of Denver professor. At 2,000 ppm, it isn't. Dr. Huffman said he slips a monitor into the backpacks of two of his children so he can keep tabs on the ventilation quality at their schools. The monitors are easy to find online. He says the most reliable are marked NDIR for \"nondispersive infrared\" sensor.</p><p>Lunch fast, or do it al fresco</p><p>Eat lunch outdoors if at all possible, Dr. Huffman said. \"As soon as you take your mask off, your risk skyrockets,\" he said. Avoid crowded cafeterias or lunchrooms. Eat quickly to reduce the time you might be exposed to the virus and avoid chitchat.</p><p>\"This sounds crazy, but I recommend being as quiet as possible,\" he said. When you talk loudly, the concentration of aerosols you breathe out can go up by a factor of 20 to 30, according to recent research, he says.</p><p>Clorox only goes so far</p><p>Here's the bottom line from many doctors and scientists: Wiping your desk with Clorox and sanitizing your hands only goes so far. The main concern, they say, is the air you breathe: Could the air in the office, the break room, the hallways and elevators contain tiny aerosol particles of Covid-19? And how much might you be exposed to in those spaces?</p><p>\"I'm not saying don't wash your hands, because if you touch a doorknob and touch your eye, you could potentially infect yourself,\" said Dr. Volckens. \"But you're constantly breathing, so your lungs are in constant contact with the air in your office. You can't stop that. You can only put a filter between your lungs and the air.\"</p><p>Write to Betsy Morris at betsy.morris@wsj.com</p><p>Toss the Clorox Wipes, Stock Up on Masks to Be Safe at Work</p>",
