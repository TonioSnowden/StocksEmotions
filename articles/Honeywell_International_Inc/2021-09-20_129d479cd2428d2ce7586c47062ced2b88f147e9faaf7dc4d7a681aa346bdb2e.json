  "title": "Honeywell at Odds With Asbestos Trust Over Bankruptcy Deal; An asbestos compensation trust that Honeywell says is mismanaged sued the industrial conglomerate",
  "text": "<p>A Honeywell spokesman said the lawsuit is meritless and was filed in anticipation of litigation from Honeywell.</p><p>\"Honeywell has evidence of severe and abusive mismanagement of the NARCO trust, including that the trust has squandered its assets and has paid claimants who have not demonstrated exposure to any NARCO product,\" Honeywell said Monday. Honeywell has attempted to engage in constructive dialogue with the NARCO trustees to rectify this matter, but has been unable to make progress.\"</p><p>Dozens of asbestos manufacturers, overrun with injury claims, have used chapter 11 to set up trusts, which have disbursed billions of dollars in compensation for victims of asbestos cancer and other ailments linked to the dangerous fibers.</p><p>But the trusts have been dogged for years by concerns from lawmakers, insurance companies and other stakeholders that they lack safeguards against fraud and are prone to paying illegitimate or unsubstantiated claims. NARCO filed for bankruptcy in 2002, facing roughly 300,000 claims for asbestos poisoning.</p><p>Much of the trust's annual resources for compensating injury claimants come from dividends from its shares in a Honeywell-affiliated company called HarbisonWalker International, which the trust received in the bankruptcy restructuring. Honeywell agreed to provide up to $150 million a year to the trust, though so far has paid only a small fraction of its total projected claims liability toward its annual contribution claims fund, the complaint said.</p><p>Under the bankruptcy deal that established the settlement trust, past and future asbestos claims against both NARCO and Honeywell are channeled to the trust to be valued and paid.</p><p>Honeywell has been pushing an early buyout of its asbestos liabilities for a $506 million lump sum and threatening litigation against the trust and its administrators for leverage, the trust said.</p><p>\"Honeywell has pursued a campaign of intimidation and threats against the trustees with the goal of coercing them to reject valid claims,\" the trust's lawyers wrote, to save money for the company's shareholders at the expense of asbestos victims.</p><p>The trust said Honeywell made an ultimatum last year that it would sue if the trust didn't accept the lump-sum cash payment and release Honeywell from its funding obligations, according to the complaint.</p><p>Honeywell said Monday it \"saw no other alternative than to ask the court to compel the trust to comply with their agreement and court-ordered obligations and grant Honeywell relief in this matter.\"</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p>",
