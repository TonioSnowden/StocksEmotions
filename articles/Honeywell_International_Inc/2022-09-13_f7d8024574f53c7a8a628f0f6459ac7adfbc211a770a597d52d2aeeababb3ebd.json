  "text": "<p>At the time, to see a young Black actor in a leading role was shocking. In the film, Poitier was taller than the others and dominated the screen. I was so proud. He was inspiring.</p><p>I never knew my dad or mom. My mother, Maggie, became pregnant while living in East St. Louis and soon came down with tuberculosis. She moved to Benton Harbor, where her family lived, to give birth to me and recover. She died four months later.</p><p>My mother already had a son, Louis, three years earlier with her then-husband, whose last name was Hudson. Upon my mother's death, my grandmother, Arrana, became my sole care provider. It was my mother's wish before dying that my brother and I share the same last name of Hudson.</p><p>Arrana was 50 when my mother died, and her six kids were already grown. We lived in a housing project on the town line. My grandmother was very involved in our community church. I went with her five days a week starting at age 3. Early on, I'd have nightmares about being chased by the devil. Later, church was about the music, singing and drama of the minister's sermons.</p><p>Growing up, I felt outside the world of my friends. They had parents, and I sensed they looked down on me. My grandmother knew this and was protective in every way.</p><p>In my teens, I formed a small vocal group called the Prophets. We'd sing in church, but I never had enough confidence to develop it. Besides, my grandmother discouraged my singing. Most of the songs on the radio were too worldly and not permitted in church.</p><p>My high school was integrated by law, but they took many of the Black kids and grouped them in a class of \"unlearnables.\" As a result, I never had eighth-grade English, algebra, geometryâ€”none of that stuff.</p><p>Finally, in the 12th grade, a teacher recognized I didn't belong in there. In the regular classes, I realized I was as smart as anybody else. After I graduated, the hard reality hit me. This was my life, and I was stuck with it. I enlisted in the Marine Corps, but I had asthma. Three months later I was discharged.</p><p>At home, I took a job as a janitor at a local company. Then I got married and my wife became pregnant shortly after. I worked all these different jobs when someone suggested college.</p><p>more house call</p><p>* Rick Lowe Went From the Fields of Alabama to a Solo Exhibit</p><p>* A Real Serial Killer Steered Karin Slaughter Toward a Life of Crime Writing</p><p>* Simon Le Bon Met Duran Duran Thanks to a Former Flame</p><p>Highland Park Community College outside of Detroit let me enroll on probation. One day, while driving around, I saw a line in front of the Detroit Repertory Theatre. Curious, I parked, got in line and asked what they were going to see.</p><p>It was Dorothy Ahmad's \"Papa's Daughter.\" I'd never seen a professional play. When the curtain came up, I was blown away. I wanted so badly to do what they were doing on stage.</p><p>After a semester at Highland, I transferred to Wayne State. When I was choosing my classes, I needed an elective. I took an acting class with Professor David Regal. Walking on stage at the theater for the first time, I felt at home.</p><p>While at Wayne State, I became the resident playwright at Concept East, the country's oldest Black theater company. I also established the Actors' Ensemble Theatre, where original works by Black playwrights were performed.</p><p>Meanwhile, my wife got her master's at the University of Michigan. When she landed a job in Minnesota at Honeywell, I went to Yale's graduate acting program. A year later I left after Gordon Parks cast me in the 1976 movie \"Leadbelly.\"</p><p>At that point, my marriage was in trouble. To raise my profile in Hollywood, I tried to get an appointment to see Sidney Poitier without luck. So I went to his office at Paramount and met him just as he was heading out. He wasn't happy.</p><p>I realize now I was in awe of him and too excited, which was a turnoff. I guess I was hoping he'd take me under his wing, but he didn't. In 2006, I worked with his daughter, Sydney, on a film. By then he and I had become friends.</p><p>Today, my wife, Linda, and I live in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. We have a home with a charming guesthouse. We also have a place in the San Fernando Valley that's near where I shoot \"The Family Business\" and \"Quantum Leap.\"</p><p>Recently, I connected with my father's family. He had passed on by then, but I learned I had two sisters and a brother. When I asked what he was like as a dad, they said I had the better part of the deal. He wasn't around when I was growing up.</p><p>Ernie's Abode</p><p>Favorite space? The upstairs sitting room at our mountain house.</p><p>Why? It's my own space and I can look down on the rest of the house.</p><p>Amazed? As a kid, I didn't know anyone who owned a house. Now I think, \"Wow, this is mine.\"</p><p>\"Ghostbusters\"? I was exhausted when finally cast. I went through three or four screen tests.</p><p>Surprised? I knew the film was going to be big, but I didn't think 38 years later it would still be something.</p><p>A College Acting Class Changed Ernie Hudson's Life.
