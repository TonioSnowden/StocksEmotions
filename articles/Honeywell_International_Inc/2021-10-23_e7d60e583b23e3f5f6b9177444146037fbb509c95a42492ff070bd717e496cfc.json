  "text": "<p>   Mr. Tedjarati acknowledged that the business environment has become \"more constricted\" amid sour U.S.-China ties, though he doesn't think multinationals' heyday in the country is over. Provided both American and Chinese politicians focus on the benefits of cooperation, U.S. companies that stay committed to China can still reap huge rewards, he said. </p><p>   U.S. companies have a significant role to play in helping China to address societal problems, he argued. \"China's climate challenge is huge,\" he said. \"China's food-security challenge is huge.\" </p><p>   He also dismissed criticism that U.S. companies should refrain from supporting strategic programs like the C919 jetliner. There's no stopping a country of China's scale from building its aerospace capabilities once it chooses to do so, he said, and U.S. companies should participate and share in the rewards rather than excluding themselves on principle. That is safe so long as they are careful to protect their intellectual property, he said. Honeywell's work on the C919 has supported hundreds of high-quality jobs at the company's facilities in Arizona and Kansas, Mr. Tedjarati said. </p><p>   He said that while Honeywell's success in China may have benefited the Chinese, the biggest winners have been its mostly American shareholders. \"We went from a $20 billion market cap to a $160 billion market cap, and China played a big role in that,\" Mr. Tedjarati said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Thomas Gryta contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
