  "text": "<p>   \"It is the end of the GE we knew, but that's not necessarily bad,\" said Mr. Cote, the former Honeywell boss. \"It's also not the end of multi-industry companies if the businesses have reason to be together, a cohesive culture, and leadership that understands all that and how to make it effective.\" </p><p>   When Trian Fund Management LP took a stake in 2015 in GE, the activist investor defended GE's conglomerate model at the time. </p><p>   \"It's not something you want to break up,\" Trian co-founder Nelson Peltz said then. \"It's something you want to keep taking care of.\" </p><p>   Trian, which remains a GE shareholder and holds a board seat, said Tuesday it supported GE's breakup plan. </p><p>   The plan unveiled Tuesday is similar to one that was discussed inside GE in early 2018. At the time it was code named Project Eisenhower, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The idea was to break up GE into its distinct divisions to allow for better management of operations and for growth. The board wasn't enthusiastic about the idea, which would have required extensive renegotiation of debt, the people said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Chip Cutter, Cara Lombardo and Nina Trentmann contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
