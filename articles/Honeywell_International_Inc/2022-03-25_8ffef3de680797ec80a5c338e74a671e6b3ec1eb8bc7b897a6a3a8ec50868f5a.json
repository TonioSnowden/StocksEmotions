  "text": "<p>The first recovered black box was believed to be the cockpit voice recorder. Made by Honeywell International Inc., the devices -- the second being the flight-data recorder -- might provide vital evidence for investigators trying to understand what caused the plane to nosedive into a terraced field in China's Guangxi region on Monday.</p><p>The positioning signal of the second black box -- actually an orange-colored device -- couldn't be detected at the scene, and its signal transmitter might have been damaged, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday, citing experts.</p><p>Zhu Tao, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, on Thursday said basic information about the incident had been submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization and the U.S.'s National Transportation Safety Board. Relevant parties would be invited to take part in the investigation after it begins, Mr. Zhu told a press conference. Currently, authorities were focused on search-and-rescue efforts and were in the early evidence-gathering stage, he said.</p><p>The NTSB, which would serve as the lead U.S. representative for the accident investigation into the U.S.-manufactured plane, was still trying to secure Chinese approval on Wednesday to expedite entry into the country, U.S. officials said.</p><p>Shu Ping, director of the Aviation Safety Institute at the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology, told the People's Daily that if a black box is in good condition, it would typically be sent to a government-designated laboratory, but if it sustained more-serious damage, it would need to be sent to Honeywell, its manufacturer, for recovery processing. The People's Daily is the Chinese Communist Party's flagship outlet.</p><p>Speaking at the Thursday press briefing, Liu Xiaodong, a publicity director at China Eastern, rebuffed rumors that the airline had reduced maintenance costs. He said that even though the number of flights was down during the pandemic, such expenses have increased recently compared with 2019.</p><p>More than 50 psychologists have arrived to provide counseling to the relatives of passengers who had rushed to the crash scene, and dozens of psychiatrists organized by Guangxi's Wuzhou city are standing by, CCTV reported Thursday.</p><p>China Eastern's Mr. Liu told reporters Thursday that the airline had created a task force to gather the demands of passengers' family members.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
