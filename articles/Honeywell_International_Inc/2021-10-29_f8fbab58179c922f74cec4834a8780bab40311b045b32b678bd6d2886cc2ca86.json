  "title": "Why increased capital spending is setting up this select group of industrial stocks to outperform in the next few years",
  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, there's a good chance that the fiscal policy that's helping to drive demand will continue, even if Congress passes a slimmed-down version of the “Build Back Better” legislation that President Biden wants.</p><p>What do companies do when demand is increasing, especially when they expect the labor market to remain tight? They increase spending on industrial capacity, automation and distribution networks. That means higher capital spending.</p><p>Below is an analysis of capital goods companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index SPX, showing which ones are expected to increase sales the most over the next several years.</p><p>The upswing in capital spending has already started, as you can see in this chart shared by LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick:</p><p>https://twitter.com/RyanDetrick/status/1453375319600152581Screen of capital goods stocks</p><p>In the S&amp;P 500, there are 11 sectors, including the industrial sector, which itself can be broken down using Global Industrial Classification Standard (GICS) industry groups: Capital Goods, Transportation, and Commercial and Professional Services.</p><p>There are 46 companies in the S&amp;P 500 Capital Goods GICS industry group.</p><p>The group trades at a weighted forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6, which is a bit lower than the full S&amp;P 500's forward P/E of 21.3, according to FactSet. The two groups typically trade at similar P/E ratios. The full index has traded slightly higher, on average, over the past three years, but the Capital Goods group has traded a bit higher per the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year average valuations.</p><p>The current discount for the Capital Goods group may be of interest because the group is expected to increase sales at a faster compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next two years (which is as far out as FactSet's aggregate data goes):</p><p>2021       2022       2023       Expected two-year sales CAGR  Estimated sales per share – S&amp;P 500 Capital Goods  $372.21    $407.20    $428.76    7.33%  Estimated sales per share – Full S&amp;P 500           $1,541.45  $1,642.76  $1,720.82  5.66%  Source: FactSet</p><p>Three tables of capital goods stocks</p><p>We will break down the 46 S&amp;P 500 companies in the Capital Goods GICS category by how far out available consensus sales estimates go.</p><p>2025 group</p><p>Consensus sales estimates among analysts polled by FactSet are available through calendar 2025 for 18 of the 46 capital goods companies.
