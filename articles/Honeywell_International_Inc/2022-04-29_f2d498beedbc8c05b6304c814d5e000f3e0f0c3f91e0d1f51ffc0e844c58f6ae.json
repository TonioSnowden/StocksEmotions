  "title": "Asbestos Lawyers Want Firm Names Scrubbed From Honeywell Bankruptcy Trial; The conglomerate fights proposed redactions of law-firm identities in asbestos trust case",
  "text": "<p>A committee of asbestos plaintiffs' firms is requesting the secrecy order ahead of a trial on the industrial conglomerate 's allegations of mismanagement against the compensation trust established by former subsidiary North American Refractories Co., bankrupted in 2002 by mass asbestos claims.</p><p>While the trial is technically between the Narco trust and Honeywell, the company has put the conduct of asbestos law firms at issue, detailing alleged instances in which claimants' lawyers submitted questionable affidavits to win compensation.</p><p>The trust allegedly waved through payments for years that weren't supported by competent and credible evidence of exposure to a Narco product, according to Honeywell's complaint.</p><p>Honeywell said in court papers Thursday that the law firm names should remain public because the conduct of those law firms is relevant to the company's case. For example, the company has said the trust paid claims based on \"form affidavits\" with boilerplate language alleging asbestos exposure and prepared in the thousands by certain lawyers and firms.</p><p>Honeywell also took issue with affidavits that it said allege only a \"proximity\" to Narco products or allow claimants to \"check the box\" on a generic description of exposure.</p><p>The trust has denied Honeywell's accusations and has said the company is trying to renegotiate a pledge to fund asbestos claims in perpetuity, pressuring the trust to accept a discounted, lump-sum buyout of the company's funding obligations. Much of the trust's resources came from dividends from its shares in Honeywell affiliate HarbisonWalker International Inc. that the trust received in Narco's bankruptcy plan.</p><p>Dozens of manufacturers of asbestos-containing products have moved through chapter 11 since the 1980s, inundated with mass lawsuits from people exposed to the cancer-causing material. Bankruptcy courts nationwide set up trusts to evaluate claims and make payments as people got sick.</p><p>Business groups, insurance companies and the U.S. government have been critical of the trusts, saying they lack transparency, pay claims with insufficient vetting and unfairly enrich plaintiffs' lawyers. Trusts generally process claims in secret, treating them as confidential settlements.</p><p>Plaintiffs' law firms said last week that Honeywell shouldn't be given a platform to disparage by name the conduct of lawyers who aren't part of the bankruptcy case and can't defend themselves. Allowing Honeywell to disclose names will have a chilling effect on those with claims against the trust, according to the firms.</p><p>\"The name of a law firm is not of consequence in determining whether or not the Trust is processing claims in an appropriate manner,\" the firms' court filing said. \"Accordingly, accusations directed to specific law firms are of no consequence.\"</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
