  "title": "Smart Thermostats Can Reduce Energy Use—but Not if You Take Away the Smart Part; A study finds that people override the settings so often, they end up using just as much or even more energy",
  "text": "<p>To reduce their energy bills, many Americans have been turning to energy-efficient smart thermostats. But a new study has found that households with smart thermostats wind up using, on average, the same energy as homes without them, and those with the devices may even increase their consumption of natural gas.</p><p>Smart thermostats are Wi-Fi-connected devices designed to allow users to easily set up energy-efficient home heating and cooling schedules. Some can also improve efficiency by detecting when no one is home and adjusting the temperature accordingly. And some provide energy-usage reports and nudge users to set temperatures at moderate levels. Users can adjust the temperature at any time on an app.</p><p>In partnership with Honeywell International Inc. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the researchers recruited 1,385 households in northern and central California to participate in the study. Participants were split into a group that received free installation of a Honeywell smart thermostat and a control group that kept their existing thermostats. The researchers then evaluated the effect of the smart thermostats on energy consumption across an 18-month period.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has using a smart thermostat changed your electricity usage? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In addition to the overall effect, the team studied energy use at specific times and in particular circumstances—days of the week, the hottest and coldest days, peak-energy-consumption times of day. \"The overall pattern is that energy use in the smart-thermostat group isn't different from the control,\" says Christopher Clapp, one of the researchers and an assistant instructional professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago who specializes in environmental microeconomics.</p><p>Dr. Clapp and his colleagues attribute the overall lack of energy savings from smart thermostats to users who frequently override the thermostats' settings, which is easily done with a tap on a smartphone. \"We see that when people override settings, they tend to use more energy, because they are not optimizing for energy usage, which was the prediction in the labs, but for comfort,\" Dr. Clapp says.</p><p>Dr. Clapp says he isn't suggesting that people not use smart thermostats. But, he says, if they really want to see savings, they need to use these devices the way engineers intended—to minimize energy use—and not override the settings to give immediate comfort.</p><p>\"It's important not to rely only on the manufacturers' own research\" when assessing the energy-saving potential of any device, he says. \"We can't just assume that these products will have the effects they claim to have.\"</p><p>Ms. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.
