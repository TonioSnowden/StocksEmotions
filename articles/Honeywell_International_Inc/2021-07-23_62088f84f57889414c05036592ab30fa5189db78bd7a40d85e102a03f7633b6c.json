  "text": "<p><em>How well did you keep up with the news this week? Take our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-07-23/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>High-profile Republicans have lined up to call for their supporters to be inoculated in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc3db449-b312-4d1d-8acd-58cee1bce594\">a sharp break</a> with the loud vaccine scepticism expressed by many party members.</p> <p>Party strategists said the sudden sense of urgency reflected a dawning realisation among Republicans that they risked being blamed for not doing enough to head off a surge of infections in red US states where vaccination rates are stubbornly low.</p> <p>Republican governors that had made headlines in recent months by banning officials, companies and colleges from cajoling people into having a jab were this week instead touting the benefits of vaccinations to hesitant residents of their states.</p> <p>Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who in May signed a bill that banned the state's businesses from asking customers to provide proof of vaccination, this week urged Floridians to get inoculated.</p> <p>Asa Hutchinson, DeSantis's counterpart in Arkansas, has embarked on a tour of the state to try to overcome deep-seated scepticism towards inoculations.</p> <p>In Washington, a group of Republican members of Congress who are also trained doctors, yesterday teamed up with two high-profile pro-Trump lawmakers, Steve Scalise and Elise Stefanik, to broadcast a similar message.</p> <p>One prominent Republican said the decision to back vaccines would help limit any political damage to the party.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“There's real political risk in the idea of re-shutting down the country. I think Republicans don't want to be blamed for it.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Intel chief says more consolidation needed in chip industry</strong> Intel's chief executive said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb9cc57-9cec-4526-b6f9-110ef32b6bfe\">more consolidation</a> was needed in the&#xa0;chip manufacturing industry, days after a report that the US chipmaker was in talks to buy GlobalFoundries for $30bn. “We just view that smaller players won't be able to keep up,” Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts to discuss Intel's latest results. </p> <ul>  <li><p>The global shortage of semiconductors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/793bcae2-509b-4287-a4da-97e0c86ee87d\">is reshaping ASML</a>, Europe's most valuable technology company, says innovation editor John Thornhill.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.

Since January, the Asian coal market benchmark has climbed 80 per cent to its highest level in more than a decade.</p> <p><strong>4. ECB divided over pledge to persist with negative rates</strong> The European Central Bank's decision to become more tolerant of inflation before raising interest rates has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b329cbe7-1d93-41f5-8812-297f0e03de58\">sparked immediate criticism</a> from some of its more hawkish policymakers in an indication of the divisions within the central bank over when to scale back bond-buying.</p> <p><strong>5.

There is one fault on which almost everyone seems to agree: arrogance and <em>mépris</em>, or contempt for ordinary people. “You can admire him without loving him,” one senior banker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d297393-7d55-4548-942b-92caa7e2112a\">told Victor Mallet</a>.</p> <p><strong>The game is still wide open </strong>The year 2021 has provided its fair share of challenges to professional fund managers as well as a somewhat less serious pursuit: the annual <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1625ef6f-83d5-4a0d-8bbf-7a61b06a963b\">Financial Times stockpicking competition</a>. Six months into this battle of cunning, wit and old-fashioned luck, it is time to see how FT hacks and 700 of our wiser readers are shaping up.</p> <p><strong>Things could fall apart for Joe Biden</strong> The US president's tribulations — the grinding to a halt of his reform bills, the stubbornness of Covid-19 and worries about the murder rate and border crossings — are largely out of his hands, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00d35c6a-0cf0-4152-b851-e5d1cd9309eb\">writes Edward Luce</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ben &amp; Jerry's gives Unilever an ice cream headache</strong> This week's announcement by Ben &amp; Jerry's that it would stop selling ice cream in the occupied Palestinian territories because it was “inconsistent with our values” triggered a ferocious response from the Israeli government and American consumers as well as Ben &amp; Jerry's independent board who complained the statement had been “watered down”. Unilever owns this latest policy and should either defend it or change it, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f89ac04-5a08-4297-9b6f-90d739211277\">says companies editor Tom Braithwaite</a>.</p> <p><strong>With 100 days until COP26, the Paris agreement pledges are crucial</strong> Extreme weather events in the US, Canada, Europe and beyond mean the rich world, addicted to oil for decades, is now feeling an uncertainty that developing countries have suffered for years, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4cf5b10-17ad-42a9-9a3d-f678f3d443da\">writes Christina Figueres</a>, the UN's former climate chief. </p> <h1>FT Magazine</h1> <p><strong>Inside the ‘ghost' distilleries that have risen from the dead</strong> Single malt is fashionable again — and commanding sky-high prices.
