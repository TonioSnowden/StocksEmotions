  "title": "China Tops U.S. In Luring Foreign Business --- Country's resilience in face of pandemic pays off as other nations' economies struggled",
  "text": "<p>China, long ranked No. 2, saw direct investments by foreign companies climb 4%, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said. Beijing used strict lockdowns to largely contain Covid-19 after the disease first emerged in a central Chinese city, and China's gross domestic product grew as most other major economies contracted last year.</p><p>The 2020 investment numbers underline China's move toward the center of a global economy long dominated by the U.S. -- a shift accelerated during the pandemic as China has cemented its position as the world's factory floor and expanded its share of global trade.</p><p>While China attracted more new inflows last year, the total stock of foreign investment in the U.S. remains much larger, reflecting the decades it has spent as the most attractive location for foreign businesses looking to expand outside their home markets.</p><p>Foreign investment in the U.S. peaked in 2016 at $472 billion, when foreign investment in China was $134 billion. Since then, investment in China has continued to rise, while in the U.S. it has fallen each year since 2017.</p><p>The Trump administration encouraged U.S. companies to leave China and re-establish operations in the U.S. It also put Chinese investors on notice that acquisitions in the U.S. would face new scrutiny on national-security grounds.</p><p>The sharper drop in foreign investment in the U.S. last year reflects the broader economic downturn because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, said Daniel Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, an independent research firm in New York, who has long analyzed the U.S.-China economic relationship.</p><p>It is natural that foreign investment would decline sharply in the U.S. under the circumstances because it has an open, market economy, while China doesn't, Mr. Rosen said. Looking ahead, he said, \"There is no reason to be concerned about the outlook for the FDI in the United States providing that the U.S. is sticking with its basic open-market competitive system.\"</p><p>Foreign direct investment captures things like foreign companies' building new factories or expanding existing operations in a country or their acquisitions of local companies.</p><p>In China, the flow of investments by multinational companies continued despite the upheavals of the pandemic, with companies from U.S. industrial giant Honeywell International Inc. and German sportswear maker Adidas AG expanding their operations there.</p><p>Unctad doesn't expect to see a significant revival of foreign direct investment this year, globally or in countries that saw falls in 2020.</p><p>\"Investors are likely to remain cautious in committing capital,\" said James Zhan, Unctad's director of investment and enterprise. He doesn't expect a real rebound to come until 2022. Even then, he said, \"the road to full FDI recovery will be bumpy.\"</p><p>While the sharp drop in foreign investment in the U.S. was because of the pandemic, it also is making companies rethink future investments, said Joseph Joyce, professor of international relations and economics at Wellesley College.</p><p>\"Companies are reassessing their policies about global supply chains, about foreign markets, about their own use of technology,\" Mr. Joyce said. \"The pandemic is making all these companies rethink the most basic assumption about where they are located.\"</p><p>The Unctad numbers show a stark divide between East and West in the global economy. In 2020, East Asia attracted a third of all foreign investment globally, its largest share since records began in the 1980s. India saw a 13% increase, driven largely by rising demand for digital services.</p><p>In the West, the European Union suffered a 71% drop. The U.K. and Italy, which have suffered high mortality rates and deep economic contractions, attracted no new investment. Germany, which has fared better on both counts, saw a 61% drop.</p><p>When the pandemic first struck at the beginning of last year, Unctad expected China to experience a large drop in foreign investment and the U.S. to be largely unscathed. But China's economy reopened in April just as the U.S. and Europe started a series of continuing lockdowns and disruptions.</p><p>Beijing's ability to quickly control the coronavirus within its borders helped its economy rebound relatively quickly and reinforced China's appeal -- even before President Biden's inauguration, which some investors hope could usher in less tempestuous U.S.-China ties.</p><p>After FDI into China plunged in the first few months of 2020, Chinese officials scrambled to reassure foreign investors and accommodate any concerns they might have. Some foreign companies put their China expansion plans on hold and in some cases began withdrawing their investments. But as China's recovery gained steam and the rest of the world began to look increasingly rocky, foreign companies moved to pour more money into China.</p><p>---</p><p>Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.</p>",
