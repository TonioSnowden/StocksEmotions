  "title": "Obituaries: Veteran of Two Wars Found Space-Age Role",
  "text": "<p>A U.S. Marine Corps pilot, Jim Bailey, was on a strafing mission over Korea in October 1951 when a burst of enemy fire crippled his F4U Corsair. He ditched the plane into choppy waters in the Yellow Sea and managed to inflate his raft. The first flare he tried to light was a dud; the second sent up a plume of smoke that helped attract an amphibious-aircraft crew.</p><p>He came home a decorated veteran of two wars who wanted to fly faster planes and had ideas about how to design them. He found a way to do both by joining Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis as an engineering test pilot.</p><p>Mr. Bailey, who became a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve, helped develop and test controls for the F-101 Voodoo jet fighter used in the Vietnam War and for the Mercury space capsule in which John Glenn spun around the Earth in 1962. Mr. Bailey befriended Neil Armstrong while teaching him to use controls on the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft.</p><p>In July 1969, when Mr. Armstrong landed on the moon in a module equipped with Honeywell controls, Mr. Bailey's family clustered around a TV set. Mr. Bailey, worried about his friend's safety, refused to watch.</p><p>\"If anything bad happened, I don't think I could have stood it,\" he said in a Honeywell video later.</p><p>Mr. Bailey, who died June 24 at the age of 99, received the Chanute Flight Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1979. The institute cited his role in developing flight-control systems.</p><p>His full name was Austin James Bailey Jr. He was born Feb. 25, 1922, in Worcester, Mass., and grew up in Norwood, near Boston. His father was an executive at Holliston Mills, a supplier of materials for book covers, and his mother was a pianist. They divorced when Jim was young, and he spent much of his childhood with his maternal grandparents.</p><p>His grandmother, he wrote in biographical notes prepared for his family, \"never said a hard word to me. She only grabbed me by the collar once, when I brought in a box of garter snakes and they escaped in the kitchen.\"</p><p>At 15, he climbed over a fence at a local airport and asked the first man he met for a job. \"I don't want money,\" he recalled saying. \"I just want to be around planes.\" He ended up helping to clean and maintain aircraft for 25 cents an hour.</p><p>After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Northeastern University in Boston and signed up for a civilian pilot training program. He completed a Navy flight training program in 1943 and served as a fighter pilot in a Marine squadron in the South Pacific, where he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross.</p><p>In 1946, home from the war, he married Nancy Leavis, his high school sweetheart. Back at Northeastern, he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1950. He and his wife were starting a family and had recently bought a house near Boston for $10,000. His fighter pilot days were over, Mr. Bailey thought. \"Like most Americans,\" he said later, \"I had other plans.\"</p><p>Then came word from the Marines: He was heading for Korea.</p><p>His Yellow Sea rescue is recounted in \"Marine Air,\" a 2005 book by Robert F. Dorr. The book quotes Mr. Bailey as recalling that his mission was to destroy railroad tracks. He and several other pilots \"ran into a flak trap,\" he said. \"I was able to climb out of there and get up to 4,000 feet, but it was clear that I wasn't going to make it home.\"</p><p>After he ditched the plane, it \"settled into the water at a 60-degree angle,\" he said. \"I climbed over the windshield, inflated the raft and got in. The waves were about nine feet, and there were a lot of whitecaps, so it was pretty rough.\"</p><p>For his service in Korea, he was awarded another Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.</p><p>Mr. Bailey joined Honeywell in 1952. During the Mercury project, he helped test the capsule's flight controls while wearing a spacesuit and spinning in a centrifuge. He later recalled feeling that his eyeballs were being pulled out of their sockets.</p><p>He is survived by four children, 10 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. His wife, Nancy Bailey, died in 2017.</p><p>In the Honeywell video, he spoke of his contribution to the U.S. space program. \"I had a little piece of something,\" he said. \"I didn't manage the whole program or anything but I supplied an important piece that fit into it.\"</p>",
