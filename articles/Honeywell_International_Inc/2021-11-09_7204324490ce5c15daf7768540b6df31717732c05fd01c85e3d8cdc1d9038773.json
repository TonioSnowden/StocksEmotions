  "title": "The GE Empire Breaks Up; The company that was once worth $600 billion will split itself in three parts.",
  "text": "<p>The Boston-based conglomerate founded by Thomas Edison has in recent years shed its locomotive, consumer appliances, lighting, oil and gas and aircraft-leasing businesses to pay off tens of billions of dollars of debt. Much of its problems stem from its legacy GE Capital division whose bad financial bets nearly sunk the company during the financial crisis. </p><p>For decades GE was a symbol of U.S. manufacturing and management prowess, and former CEO Jack Welch was hailed as a business genius. In 2000, the year before Welch retired, GE's market capitalization hit nearly $600 billion. It's now $122 billion, a tragic decline for the investors and retirees who had relied on its steady returns. During the bubble years GE relied on swelling profits from its financial arm to stoke shareholder returns. </p><p>Successor Jeff Immelt was slow to see the financial risks emerging, and to adjust the GE business mix, and he never did find a successful strategy after the recession. He was enamored in particular of renewable energy and in 2006 posed as a climate-change hero in Vanity Fair. \"Green is green,\" he liked to say. Mr. Culp, who was brought in three years ago, is still mopping up. </p><p>Mr. Culp has been focused on shrinking GE's industrial empire and debt so the company can invest more in its core manufacturing units and become more competitive with the likes of Honeywell and Siemens. Shareholders are also eager to see increased dividends.</p><p>The breakup will let investors choose how to allocate their capital among the three businesses. Shareholders bearish on green energy can put their money elsewhere. GE's wind-turbine business this year has been hit by increasing material costs as well as uncertainty over Congress's extension of renewable tax credits, which has resulted in lower orders. </p><p>GE's rise and fall is fundamentally a story of American capitalism. Capital flows to businesses that create the most value for investors. But success is always precarious as business and technology change. Growth requires constant innovation, adaptation and, yes, creative destruction. </p><p>Mr. Immelt was a better politician than corporate leader, and amid the financial crisis in 2008 he told shareholders that \"the interaction between government and business will change forever. In a reset economy, the government will be a regulator; and also an industry policy champion, a financier, and a key partner.\" He was right, but neither GE nor the country are better for it.</p><p>The GE Empire Breaks Up</p>",
