  "text": "<p>   Last-mile delivery specialist LaserShip Inc. poached a veteran supply-chain executive from Home Depot Inc. as its new chief executive. </p><p>   LaserShip, based in Vienna, Va., said Mark Holifield will take the helm Nov. 8. </p><p>   Mr. Holifield has been executive vice president of supply chain and product development at the Atlanta-based home-improvement giant since early 2014. </p><p>   LaserShip, owned by private-equity firms American Securities and Greenbriar Equity Group, this month agreed to acquire OnTrac Logistics Inc. in a roughly $1.3 billion deal aimed at extending its reach across a wider swath of the U.S. at a time of surging e-commerce demand. </p><p>   \"Mark's experience building large-scale networks will enable our successful combination with OnTrac as we look to merge the companies' networks to provide expanded customer service in 2022,\" said Will Manuel, chairman of LaserShip and a managing director of American Securities. </p><p>   Home Depot credits Mr. Holifield with engineering a supply-chain transformation at the company, adding its network of rapid deployment centers aimed at supplying stores more quickly and efficiently. Mr. Holifield joined Home Depot in 2006 as senior vice president of supply chain after spending a dozen years at office-supplies retailer Office Depot. </p><p>   Mr. Holifield's departure from Home Depot comes as myriad sectors of the economy grapple with supply-chain bottlenecks that have led to shortages and higher consumer costs. </p><p>   Home Depot said John Deaton, who had been senior vice president of supply chain since 2017 before becoming senior vice president of retail operations earlier this year, will succeed Mr. Holifield as executive vice president of supply chain and product development, effective Nov. 1. </p><p>   Mr. Deaton joined Home Depot in 2007 and also helped lead the rollout of the rapid deployment centers. </p><p>   \"We're incredibly fortunate to have such a strong bench of talented leaders like John, who has delivered outstanding results with every challenge he's taken on over the past 14 years at The Home Depot,\" said Craig Menear, the retailer's chairman and chief executive. </p><p>   The combination of LaserShip and Chandler, Ariz.-based OnTrac, slated to close by the end of the year, comes as regional package carriers are pushing into new coverage areas while shippers jockey for parcel capacity. </p><p>   The combined entity would have more than 100 sorting and delivery hubs in 30 states and the District of Columbia, creating a network allowing two-day shipping to 74% of the U.S. population. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jennifer Smith contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
