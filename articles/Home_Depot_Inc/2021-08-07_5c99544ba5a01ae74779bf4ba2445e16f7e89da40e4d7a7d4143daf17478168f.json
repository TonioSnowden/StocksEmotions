  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Before you buy shares in a company expected to benefit from the post-Covid consumer boom, ask yourself a question: Will you spend the money you saved during the pandemic? </p><p>\n  Economic figures for 2021 will be eye-popping. This past week, the eurozone reported that gross domestic product increased 13.7% in the second quarter from a year earlier. In the U.S., economic output expanded by a similar amount, due to an 11.8% annualized increase in personal consumption expenditures, which is the second-fastest rate since 1952, behind only the third quarter of last year. </p><p>\n  Investors and policy makers alike are expecting this sudden release of \"pent-up demand\" to lead to a sustained period of buoyant economic growth. U.S. households' net wealth has risen by $18 trillion during the pandemic, thanks in part to expanded unemployment insurance and stimulus checks. Researchers at the European Stability Mechanism found that eurozone households accumulated 600 billion euros (equivalent to about $705 billion) in excess savings in 2020 -- 5% of 2019 GDP -- with 45% of it resulting from lack of opportunities to consume. </p><p>\n  So far, the data shows that people are eager to return to normal. But the real question is whether they will splurge to make up for the lost times. </p><p>\n  Recently, concerning patterns have crept into some of the numbers that analysts are using to gauge the recovery in real time: Credit-card spending, transport usage and restaurant reservations by both Americans and Britons all seem to have passed their peak. Movie attendance has stalled at levels well below what once passed for normal. Services consumption remains extremely weak across the board, official data shows. </p><p>\n  Coronavirus variants are a big concern: They are now calling the Asian recovery into question, and have weighed heavily on retail sales in the U.K. and the eurozone -- though numbers for June released Wednesday showed an encouraging rebound. </p><p>\n  None of this implies that spending will fall off a cliff. Vaccines all but guarantee that the global economy will be able to cope with the pandemic from now on. </p><p>\n  If the consumer recovery turns out to be too choppy, however, it could hit market sentiment. Wall Street analysts' forecasts for \"cyclical\" consumer-facing companies assume that households will run down their accumulated savings for a protracted period, pushing 2022 sales well above where they would have been without Covid-19, FactSet data shows. Forecasts also have been upgraded in other industries, but not by nearly as much. </p><p>\n  In North America, these firms' sales are now expected to be 31% higher in 2022 than in 2019. Before the pandemic they were predicted to be only 16% higher next year. Abroad, particularly in Western Europe, sales projections don't fully offset the larger chunk of income lost in 2020, but are still much higher than pre-Covid. </p><p>\n  Prominent in the \"consumer cyclicals\" category are auto makers, led by Volkswagen, Toyota and Daimler, which are now experiencing production constraints due to a world-wide shortage of microchips. Bottlenecks in housing materials likewise are affecting specialist retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's. </p><p>\n  Pent-up spending is expected to boost sales for apparel manufacturers like Nike and Zara owner Inditex, and luxury companies such as LVMH and EssilorLuxottica. \"Consumer staples\" firms like Walmart, Amazon.com and Nestle weren't really affected by the pandemic, but have had their revenue projections generously upgraded anyway. </p><p>\n  For Wall Street's forecasts to come true, savings rates, which hit 20% in 2020, will probably need to fall below recent historical averages, and at a faster pace than usual. A historical analysis of developed countries by Jamie Thompson of Oxford Economics suggests that this is quite feasible, because faster increases in savings rates often beget equally quick unwinds. </p><p>\n  Yet the data also shows that, in such periods, much depends on whether overall growth is strong enough. At this point, most countries are still projected to experience a permanent output loss due to the pandemic. The U.S. is the big exception. </p><p>\n  This is why it is dangerous to assume that whatever cars and home renovations global consumers aren't able to procure this year will simply be pushed into next. If coronavirus variants linger or the labor-market recovery stalls, the initial spending spurt could lead to a hangover in 2022 rather than another year of strong recovery. </p><p>\n  Research shows that households tend to quickly burn through anything they perceive as an income windfall, but are far less prone to consume out of increases in wealth. The longer the normalization of the economy takes, the more likely it is that they will see pandemic savings as the latter. This is especially true since the largest cash increases happened in the bank accounts of older, wealthier people with lower propensities to consume. </p><p>\n  Much will depend on whether officials keep activist fiscal policies going well into 2022, or decide to claw back revenues prematurely. Yes, 2021 consumption numbers will look stellar. Whether they stick isn't a done deal. </p><p></p>",
