  "text": "<p>The two companies' guidance signals a new phase for the home-improvement sector following two years of surging demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. The moderating sales outlook highlights a split in the companies' trends for gross margins, a measure of how revenue compares with the cost of goods sold.</p><p>Rising wages and supply-chain challenges have made it difficult for companies across the economy to increase their margins in recent months, but Lowe's said its gross margin improved by more than a percentage point in the latest quarter compared with last year. Analysts had been expecting the metric to rise by just a fraction of that amount.</p><p>That performance drew a contrast with Home Depot's. Its gross margins have been declining, in part due to costs from extensive investments it has been making in its supply chain.</p><p>Investors have zeroed in on that metric when digesting the companies' results this week, D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said. \"If there's one thing in particular, it's the difference in the gross margin trend,\" he said.</p><p>Lowe's said that better product pricing relative to costs and better shrink results both contributed to its higher margins. Shrink refers to merchandise that is lost to theft or damage.</p><p>\"We're just extremely pleased with the performance from a shrink perspective,\" Lowe's finance chief David Denton said. \"I think the store teams and the loss-prevention teams have just done an excellent job of managing that.\"</p><p>Management of costs and pricing is likely to help gross margin improve again this year, he said.</p><p>During the pandemic, demand for home-improvement projects has fueled outsize gains for the sector's stocks. Since early March 2020, roughly when the pandemic reached the U.S., Lowe's shares have more than doubled, while Home Depot's are up by about 38%.</p><p>Now, the companies are projecting that sales in 2022 won't likely match the double-digit growth achieved in recent years.</p><p>Lowe's quarterly sales rose to $21.34 billion, up from a year-earlier $20.31 billion. Comparable sales, a metric that strips out the effects of store openings and closings, increased by 5% year over year.</p><p>The company's profit was $1.21 billion, or $1.78 a share, up from $1.32 a share a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting sales of $20.92 billion and earnings of $1.71 a share.</p><p>Looking ahead, Lowe's said it expects that on a comparable basis, sales in 2022 will register between a 1% decline and a 1% improvement from 2021's levels. It forecast that profits will grow by approximately 8% to 13%.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Lowe's Share Price Rises as Profitability Improves</p>",
