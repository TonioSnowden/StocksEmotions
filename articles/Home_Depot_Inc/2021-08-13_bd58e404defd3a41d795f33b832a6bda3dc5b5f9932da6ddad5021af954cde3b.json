  "text": "<p>   When Christopher Lyon walked into his Washington, D.C., home during his last renovation, he saw red. </p><p>   Or rather, a dozen shades of off-white splashed on the walls in 2-foot squares, a neutral checkerboard that made him dizzy. \"It looked like you were in some kind of modern art painting,\" recalls Dr. Lyon, a retired educator. </p><p>   After staring at the samples for weeks, Dr. Lyon gave his husband, Art Coleman, one final week to pick a paint color and get it on the walls. Mr. Coleman, an education policy and legal consultant who quite enjoyed testing different options, acknowledged the experiment had gotten out of hand and complied. </p><p>   Choosing a shade of white paint from more than a thousand nearly identical hues has long been confounding. As homeowners flocked to hardware stores for renovation projects during the pandemic, sales of paint spiked, along with stress levels. </p><p>   The process is only getting harder as companies roll out new variations with particular undertones for those looking to achieve a warm, crisp or cool vibe. </p><p>   Isabel Ladd, an interior designer in Lexington, Ky., said sometimes a client will call and ask, \"Will you come over? I have put 15 swatches of white on my wall,\" looking for guidance. </p><p>   \"I'm a maximalist and I know what's too much,\" the designer said. \"And that's too much.\" </p><p>   She tries to provide some perspective -- which may have been lost around sample number 7 -- that the ultimate decision isn't really that high-stakes. \"They're like, 'Life is about to change,'\" she said. Her stock response: \"This is paint. This is white paint. This is not cancer.\" </p><p>   Ms. Ladd maintains a spreadsheet listing paint colors from past projects, with notes about undertones and other impressions. From that, she has established four go-to Benjamin Moore shades, depending on if the client wants a creamier color (Lily of the Valley), a blue undertone (Cotton Balls), green hints (French Canvas) or has no idea at all (White Dove). </p><p>   Part of the problem: Paint companies' descriptions are akin to wine tasting notes, poetic but not necessarily helpful. </p><p>   Farrow &amp; Ball's Shadow White is \"the perfect contrast to the slightly darker Shaded White.\" PPG's Static is \"a light, gray, tarnished yellow with a khaki undertone.\" The company recommends users \"pair it with dusty peaches.\" </p><p>   \"Life used to be so much easier when you could say, 'What color do you want your walls, white or off-white?'\" said Ghislaine Vinas, a New York-based interior designer. She calls herself a purist, generally pitching her clients on simple Benjamin Moore White, which she said offers a clean, uncomplicated backdrop. </p><p>   As for cream and beige, Ms. Vinas said, \"It's like seeing a T-shirt with sweaty armpit stains and saying, 'Isn't that pretty?'\" </p><p>   But then she rented a place with those colors. \"These walls brought me so much solace,\" she said, joking that the experience undermined her most fundamental design advice. </p><p>   Benjamin Moore offers a collection of 152 of its \"most requested off-white colors,\" shades that are \"versatile yet complex.\" Behr's website lists 167 white options. PPG, which owns the Glidden line, has 315 at Home Depot. </p><p>   \"To say 'curated to 152 paints' is like narrowing down to the grains of sand on a beach,\" said Jonathan Levav, a marketing professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who has studied how the number of choices available can affect consumer decision-making behavior. \"It's somewhere between ridiculous and pointless.\" </p><p>   Dr. Levav, whose research shows people who need to make a series of decisions can get worn down by the process and start acting irrationally, avoided such stress during his recent renovation. His decorator narrowed the field to a manageable three or four choices. </p><p>   Farrow &amp; Ball makes about 30 neutral colors, like whites and grays. \"It's very, very carefully curated, carefully edited, to what we feel is needed in the market at the moment,\" said Joa Studholme, the company's color curator. </p><p>   She recently introduced School House White, a shade initially concocted for her own home in Somerset, England. She describes it as \"plain, but not bland.\" </p><p>   Ms. Studholme said the mania for white and other neutral-toned walls picked up in the 1990s, though off-white preferences have shifted recently toward beige from gray. \"We're all craving softer colors, colors that will just give us a hug\" nowadays, she said. </p><p>   Benjamin Moore's popular Chantilly Lace is intended to evoke \"images of pure silk, soft linen and simpler times.\" The same brand's Simply White is \"fresh as the first snowfall.\" That's not to be confused with Snowfall White, which is \"as crisp and clean as winter's first snow.\" The company also sells Snow White, and more than a half-dozen others with winter and frost in the names. </p><p>   Curt Zeller gave up trying to keep track of which white he used on the trim in his Pittsburgh home, where he has lived for about 15 years. Now, he buys Behr Premium Plus white base paint -- the base other tints are mixed into. </p><p>   \"No Snowdrift or Morning Mist or Granny's Hair or whatever of the 10,000 whites there are,\" said Mr. Zeller, who works in information technology. </p><p>   Aafrine and Usman Ahmed moved into a new house in Birmingham, England, four months ago. They still haven't decided on what white to use. </p><p>   \"There's grays and there's browns and there's whites, and your whites have to go with your grays and your browns,\" Ms. Ahmed said. \"I just don't want to walk into the house on a gray day and think I picked the wrong white.\" </p><p></p>",
