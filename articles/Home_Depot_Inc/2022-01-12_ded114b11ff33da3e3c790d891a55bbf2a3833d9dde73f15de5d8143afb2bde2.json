  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Grinch didn't steal Americans' Christmas, but he might make a late appearance. </p><p>\n  Expanded child tax credits, which provided a reliable boost to Americans' wallets on the 15th of every month, ended a month ago. Those payments, which expanded both the size and eligibility of child tax credits, provided up to $300 per child a month, reviving retail sales that had slowed after Americans stopped receiving stimulus checks. </p><p>\n  In total, those monthly child-tax-credit payments boosted consumers' wallets by a collective $16 billion a month on average, according to a research note from J.P. Morgan. That is roughly double what Americans spend on electronics and in appliances stores monthly. </p><p>\n  At the moment, a revival of those payments hangs by a thin thread in Congress, meaning retailers should brace for a rocky start to the year. </p><p>\n  Last year, there was a noticeable drop in retail sales between April, a month after consumers received their last federal stimulus checks, and July, when monthly child-tax-credit payments kicked in. It wasn't a seasonal effect, either: Even in years preceding the pandemic, sales tended to rise during the April-July window. </p><p>\n  Once those child-tax-credit payments kicked in starting mid-July, retail sales picked up. Spending on apparel and in department stores, in particular, saw a big uptick in the days immediately following the first distribution on July 15, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. </p><p>\n  Tax-refund season typically gives retailers a separate uplift because consumers tend to spend the windfall on big-ticket items. AutoZone Chief Executive Officer Bill Rhodes said in an earnings call last month that any period with a tax refund resulted in a \"big spike\" in business. This year, that isn't a sure thing. </p><p>\n  The expanded child tax credits meant that families got half of the credits they would have otherwise claimed on their 2021 tax return in advance. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, Americans' personal savings rate had dropped to pre-pandemic levels by November. </p><p>\n  With that in mind, the interlude before major retailers report their results is a good time for investors to ponder just how hot retail stocks have been. The S&amp;P 500 retailing index's enterprise value as a multiple of forward revenue is 13% higher than its five-year average. </p><p>\n  After outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by roughly 30 percentage points last year, both Home Depot and Lowe's sport enterprise values as multiples of their respective forward sales near 10-year highs. Dollar General, which has higher exposure to low-income consumers, is trading at a multiple that is 28% above its five-year average. </p><p>\n  Investors in U.S. retail stocks are primed for optimism after a string of pleasant surprises last year, but caution is warranted now. Shoppers might have a lot less to spend as 2022 kicks off. </p><p></p>",
