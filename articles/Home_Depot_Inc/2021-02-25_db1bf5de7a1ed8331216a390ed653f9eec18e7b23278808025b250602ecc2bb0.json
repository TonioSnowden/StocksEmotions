  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Home Depot's Chief Executive Craig Menear boasted on Tuesday that \"for many customers, the home has never been more important.\" Investors are getting anxious about how long that will continue. </p><p>\n  Home Depot and Lowe's had strong holiday quarters ended late January, with sales up roughly 25% compared with a year earlier. Among the bestsellers were lumber and outdoor-living categories. For the year, Lowe's and Home Depot saw their revenue expand 24.2% and 19.9%, respectively. But investors are focused on the future. Despite strong results, Lowe's and Home Depot shares fell after their earnings calls this week. </p><p>\n  Lowe's stuck to the guidance it laid out in December, in which it said sales would be about $86 billion in 2021 under the most bullish scenario, a drop of 4% from 2020. Home Depot didn't give guidance. </p><p>\n  So far, there are no signs of sales slowing down. January was the strongest month of growth last quarter for both companies, boosted by fresh stimulus payments to consumers. Home Depot said on its earnings call that it has seen continued strong demand in February. </p><p>\n  Even without the same level of consumer home-improvement projects, the retailers have reasons to be optimistic. Lowe's still has room to increase profitability. Its operating margins have been lower than Home Depot's, but it is catching up thanks to productivity initiatives such as modernized checkout systems. Under its most bearish scenario, Lowe's expects its adjusted operating margins to expand this year. </p><p>\n  Home Depot should benefit from a higher mix of professional customers, who are showing stronger demand as consumers become less wary of letting strangers into their homes. Home Depot has potential to boost business through HD Supply, a maintenance, repair and operations business it bought last year. </p><p>\n  In contrast to other pandemic-era winners such as Lululemon, these home-improvement retailers aren't much more expensive than they were a year ago. Home Depot and Lowe's shares trade at roughly 20 times and 18 times forward earnings, respectively, slightly lower than where they were a year ago. A broad basket of retail stocks have gotten more expensive over the same time. </p><p>\n  There are also no signs that the housing boom is winding down soon. In January, existing home sales were up 23.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the main limiting factor appears to be a lack of inventory. That should keep registers ringing at Home Depot and Lowe's. </p><p></p>",
