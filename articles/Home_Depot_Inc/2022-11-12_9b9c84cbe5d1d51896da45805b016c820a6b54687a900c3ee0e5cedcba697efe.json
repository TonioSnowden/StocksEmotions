  "title": "U.S. News:  Biden's Student-Loan Relief  Faces Mounting Legal Hurdles  ----  By Gabriel T. Rubin",
  "text": "<p>   The Biden administration faces a complicated legal path for jump-starting its mass student-debt cancellation plan after a federal judge in Texas blocked it on Thursday. </p><p>   In light of the ruling, the Education Department has stopped accepting applications for the program after nearly 20 million people submitted their income information in recent weeks. The administration immediately moved to appeal the decision and could file a motion that seeks to stay the Texas ruling for now. But even if that request were successful, the White House is still facing a roadblock in a separate case pending in a different jurisdiction. </p><p>   The St. Louis-based Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals already had placed the program on hold in a temporary order last month, in a case brought by Republican officials in six states. An additional ruling from that court is expected in the coming days. </p><p>   On Wednesday, before the debt-relief plan was struck down, President Biden singled out the issue as a top one that motivated young voters to turn out for the midterms in \"historic numbers.\" </p><p>   \"We will continue to keep borrowers informed about our efforts to deliver targeted relief,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement Friday. \"Separately, we remain committed to taking other actions to fix longstanding issues in the student loan forgiveness system and hold schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs.\" </p><p>   Biden administration officials have been quietly preparing for the possibility that a court would strike down the program, according to administration officials, and have been discussing both legal and policy responses to such a move. </p><p>   In particular, it remains unknown whether the administration will seek to extend the pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments. Interest has been frozen and payments have been suspended since March 2020, but the administration was planning to end the pause as of Jan. 1. </p><p>   An online petition from the Student Debt Crisis Center, a borrower-support organization, had accrued more than 20,000 signatures as of late Friday morning, asking Mr. Biden to extend the pause until all roadblocks to receiving debt relief have been removed. </p><p>   The Biden debt-cancellation plan would forgive up to $10,000 for federal student-loan borrowers who make under $125,000 a year, or $250,000 for married couples. Pell Grant recipients would qualify for an additional $10,000 in relief. </p><p>   Thursday's ruling from U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman called the Biden administration's plan an \"unconstitutional exercise of Congress's legislative power\" and said that borrowers hadn't been able to weigh in on the merits of the program through a rule-making process. The lawsuit was supported by the Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative group founded by Home Depot Inc. co-founder Bernie Marcus. </p><p>   The Education Department said it was ready to immediately move to forgive debt for 16 million borrowers whose applications for relief have already been processed, \"when allowed by the courts.\" </p><p>   Several lawsuits have been filed in courts around the country challenging the student-debt program. Until Thursday, none had any success in attacking the program's legality. </p><p>   The Republican-led case pending at the Eighth Circuit focused on the preliminary issue of whether GOP leaders have standing to challenge the debt-relief on behalf of their six states. A U.S. District Court judge in St. Louis who originally considered that question said they didn't. </p><p></p>",
