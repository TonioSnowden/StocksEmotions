  "title": "Consumers Pay More for Less, Boosting Walmart and Home Depot; The large retail chains report stronger quarterly sales as prices rise and shoppers adjust spending",
  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. reported stronger revenue in the most recent quarter, signs that Americans are spending even as they pay more for fewer products and are shifting their purchases to mitigate the effects of inflation.</p><p>Investors bid up shares in both companies Tuesday, propelling the broader stock market, as their top lines and profits came in stronger than analysts had expected. Walmart shares rose 5.1%, and Home Depot shares rose 4.1%. The gains helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly 240 points, or 0.7%.</p><p>\"I certainly don't want to say the consumer is strong, but they are relatively OK,\" said Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey, in an interview.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Walmart's business? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Walmart said revenue rose 8.4% to $152.86 billion in the July quarter, helped by consumers paying more for items, market-share gains in its grocery business and more visits from shoppers. Company executives expect inflation and consumer spending to stay steady throughout the year. Home-improvement retailer Home Depot also reported higher quarterly sales, rising 6.5% to $43.79 billion, despite a decline in the number of transactions from a year ago.</p><p>While many Americans are showing signs of financial stress, some measures of consumer health have shown improvement in recent weeks. Inflation hovered near four-decade highs in July but came down slightly from the previous month as gas prices fell. U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early August, continuing its climb from a record low earlier this summer as inflation expectations improved.</p><p>A reading on U.S. retail spending for July is due out Wednesday. Retailers such as Target Corp. and Lowe's Cos. are slated to release quarterly financial results.</p><p>Walmart, the nation's largest retailer by revenue and Sam's Club owner, sent a warning last month that efforts to clear out excess inventory and weaker-than-expected demand for a range of products would diminish operating income—a key measure of profitability—this year. Roughly three weeks later, Walmart on Tuesday tempered the downbeat forecast, saying that operating income would shrink by a smaller margin than it expected.</p><p>Sales and the number of visits to Walmart stores accelerated near the end of the quarter, in part, because more high-income shoppers started to flock to Walmart for groceries, said Chief Executive Doug McMillon. The start of the back-to-school shopping season has also been strong, he said. \"Fuel coming down in recent weeks is helpful,\" he said. But \"it's still about 27% inflated per gallon versus a year-ago nationally.\"</p><p>Still, many consumers are spending more, but buying less. At Walmart, grocery sales volumes fell slightly during the quarter, but dollar sales rose due to higher prices and share gains. Industrywide, grocery sales volumes fell 2.5% in the four weeks ended July 10, according to data from market-research firm IRI. Walmart earns most of its U.S. revenue through grocery sales.</p><p>Home Depot said the number of transactions fell by 3% from a year ago. However, high-value transactions, or those over $1,000, grew fast. Overall comparable sales, those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 5.8% in the quarter ended July 31 from the same period last year.</p><p>Home Depot executives said on a call with analysts they noticed an uptick in spending near the end of the second quarter and into the current quarter. Executives at the retailer believe some people are back home doing improvement projects after summer vacations.</p><p>\"When you look at the wealth creation over the last two years, home-price appreciation of almost 40%, our customer is just in a really good place right now,\" Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said on the call.</p><p>Higher prices, however, might have turned some inflation-addled customers away from some big-ticket items like lawn mowers, but spending in paint and other large renovation categories has remained strong, the company said.</p><p>Rapid shifts in consumer buying patterns have weighed on retailers' profits of late and, in some instances, created a glut of the products that were early pandemic favorites such as patio furniture and bikes.</p><p>On Tuesday, Walmart said operating income in the latest quarter slipped 6.8% due to higher discounts and selling more grocery items, which typically have smaller profit margins than general merchandise.</p><p>Walmart has been working to get its financial house in order by trimming costs, including culling its corporate ranks in recent weeks.</p><p>The company's stores are packed with discounted goods, with rows of toys, clothes and summer items under yellow clearance signs. The value of inventory was up 25% in the second quarter from a year ago, but that is lower than the first quarter and executives said they believe inventory has peaked.</p><p>Walmart has canceled billions worth of orders and sold much of its excess summer product, but it is still working to sell electronics, home goods and apparel goods to get stores ready for the holiday shopping season, said Mr. Rainey on a conference call.</p><p>Walmart aims to be more conservative with its buying volume for next year, Mr. McMillon said on the call. \"You don't want to go into too much of a defensive mode,\" he said, or \"repeat the mistakes that we had in the first half of this year.\"</p><p>Overall Walmart said its net income in the three months ended in July was $5.15 billion, compared with $4.28 billion a year earlier.</p><p>The company now expects operating income to fall 9% to 11% for the full year, down from a previous estimate of 11% to 13%. U.S. comparable sales will grow around 4% during that time, Walmart said.</p><p>Home Depot posted earnings of $5.17 billion, or $5.05 a share, compared with $4.81 billion, or $4.53 a share, in the same quarter last year.</p><p>Dean Seal contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Consumers Pay More for Less, Boosting Walmart and Home Depot</p>",
