  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Design & Decorating -- That's Debatable:  Should Halloween Decor Be 'In Good Taste'?  ----  By Ruby King",
  "text": "<p>\n  YES: Kathia Emery actively anticipates Halloween, but you won't find her at Target with a cart full of plastic jack-o'-lanterns. \"I don't want what everybody else has,\" said the Portland, Ore., interior designer, whose fright-night kit veers more toward Mary Shelley's Frankenstein than Mel Brooks's. She drapes antique tables with blue toile linens, then clusters gourds, pomegranates and black candles atop them. Above, a small murder of austere crows clings to her chandelier. Ms. Emery adds elegance to hackneyed Halloween fare by spray-painting pumpkins silver and studding them with upholstery tacks. </p><p>\n  Iris Watts, a decor enthusiast in San Antonio whose blog brims with tasteful holiday-design tips, shuns ornaments that call too much attention to themselves. \"They can quickly make your home feel chaotic,\" she said. \"I think chic Halloween decorating comes down to using pieces that are recognizable as macabre but are interwoven into your everyday home style,\" said Ms. Watts, who avoids anything cartoonish in favor of the eerily realistic. Last year her post-apocalypse theme included suggestions of human neglect: While spiders and centipedes crawled up paintings, faux vines crept from behind the frames; here and there perched ravens -- whose carrion-rich diet linked them to death long before Edgar Allan Poe penned his haunting verse. </p><p>\n  Mathilde Pittet, the Parisian expat behind French-lifestyle website Leonce Chenal, also bypasses overly seasonal Halloween bling. She opts instead for objects she can leave in her Amsterdam home year round if she chooses. Her display includes busts, dried flowers and vintage decanters and candlesticks. \"They remind me of items found in Christian cathedrals and French castles,\" she said. \"For me, chic and classy Halloween decor is gothic with a twist.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  NO: Good taste is overrated,\" proclaimed John Loecke when articulating his approach to Halloween decor. One half of High Point, N.C., lifestyle brand Madcap Cottage, he and his partner, Jason Oliver Nixon, love the holiday's nostalgic vibe and wax poetic on the dangers of squelching one's childlike spirit for the sake of aesthetic discretion. \"Who wants a tidy little stack of pumpkins on their table? It's go big or go home,\" said Mr. Nixon. The pair, big believers in inflatables, dot the lane leading up to their house with 4-foot blowup ghosts and witches, and greet visitors with an air-filled incarnation of Charles M. Schulz's Great Pumpkin as tall as they are. </p><p>\n  When tricking out her house, Sara Barney, principal designer at Bandd/Design in Austin, Texas, also leans more Monster Mash than Danse Macabre. \"Halloween decorations should be silly and playful because it's a fun holiday and we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously with it,\" said Ms. Barney, who expresses her joie de vivre by arranging for giant plastic spiders to scale her house and skeletons to caper in her yard. </p><p>\n  Keith Duncan, an insurance agent in Tucson, Ariz., decorates his house from top-to-bottom because he \"loves scaring the crap out of teenagers and adults.\" Chic restraint doesn't cut it, though he does draw the line at gory so as not to frighten young children. His terror tools include string lights, faux gravestones, giant cobwebs, an assembly of arachnids and a famously viral Halloween accouterment: Home Depot's 12-foot skeleton with animatronic eyes, which sold out both last year when it premiered and again this September. At $299, the prop isn't exactly low-rent, but Mr. Duncan argues that killer Halloween setups needn't be expensive. \"With some imagination and fun, you can make something people will remember for years,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
