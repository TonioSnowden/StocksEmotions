  "title": "Austin's Texas-Size Luxury Housing Boom; The capital city has one of the hottest high-end real-estate markets in the country, with entry-level list prices for the top 5% of the market hitting $2.34 million in 2021, a rise of nearly 33% over 2020 prices",
  "text": "<p>\"For the next few weeks we kept losing out on land deals,\" Mr. Prusz said. The couple switched gears and looked for a built home, but inventory was low and prices seemed ridiculous. They didn't even bother touring a house still under construction that was \"just a big box completely full of Home Depot fixtures priced at $3.5 million.\" Completed, it sold for $5.2 million.</p><p>Finally, the Pruszes took a second look at a new 5,200-square-foot, five-bedroom home under construction in Tarrytown, a leafy neighborhood 10 minutes from downtown. When they first saw the house in September last year, the $4.3 million list price seemed too high. Two months later, it seemed reasonable. The Pruszes offered full asking price for the home in November 2020, closing in July.</p><p>\"The crazy part is it was more expensive than our home in Los Angeles,\" said Mr. Prusz, who sold the family's 3,200-square-foot Santa Monica home for $3.945 million in December last year. He now works remotely from a home office converted from a bedroom by Ms. Prusz, 39, a stay-at-home mom with an interest in design, who also redid all the fixtures and installed a wine room at a total cost of about $100,000. </p><p>Cristina and Joe Prusz with their children, Marlowe and Hudson.

The entry-level list price for a luxury home—defined as the top 5% of the market—hit $2.34 million in 2021, an increase of nearly 33% over 2020 home prices, and a 44% rise over 2017 prices, according to data analysis by Realtor.com. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) Luxury homes that took nearly four months to sell five years ago are now going into contract in under two months.</p><p>Home sale prices aren't publicly recorded because of Texas nondisclosure laws. That has fostered a shadowy gray zone in Austin's ultraluxury market, where high-price pocket listings are bought and sold without ever hitting the multiple-listing service.</p><p>\"When people come to town looking for big houses, they're not going to find them clicking on Zillow. We like to keep that inventory very off the radar,\" said Cord Shiflet, a real-estate agent with Moreland Properties and the incoming president of the Austin Board of Realtors.</p><p>Right now, there isn't much inventory—on the radar or off. \"The problem with all of us [selling homes] at the upper end is we have all called our friends and waved as much money at them as we can and we've found everyone that wants to sell,\" Mr. Shiflet said. \"I just keep coming back to them with bigger and bigger numbers.\"</p><p>Many would-be Austinites are coastal émigrés drawn by the region's burgeoning tech industry. Oracle announced its planned move from Silicon Valley to Austin's Silicon Hills last December, and Apple will open a new $1 billion campus in north Austin next year.</p><p>The most prominent Silicon Valley defector is Elon Musk, who in October declared that Tesla would relocate its headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, where he is building a new factory. Mr. Musk, who boasted over the summer that he was living in a tiny rental house on the campus of SpaceX, his commercial spaceflight company in Boca Chica, Texas, is now said to be hunting for an Austin estate with ample acreage and city views, according to people in the local real-estate industry. Mr. Musk couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>The Sunbelt city's laid-back atmosphere—less formal than Houston, funkier than Dallas—its lively music and cultural scene, and its picturesque surroundings in Texas Hill Country are all attracters; so is Texas's lack of a personal income tax.</p><p>\"Everything was up in the air when Covid first hit; but a pandemic year that started with so much uncertainty ended with the highest number of [corporate] relocations we've seen,\" said Laura Huffman, president of the Austin Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Developers are scrambling to catch up. The Grove, a 75-acre mixed-use development with shops, restaurants and a park about 3 miles from downtown, began closings on 35 single-family homes in late 2019; 15 available homes, which will be released for sale through the end of this year, are priced from $2.15 million to $2.4 million.</p><p>At Driftwood, a private golf-club community now under construction about a half-hour outside Austin, 315 home sites are priced from $3.5 million to $6 million.</p><p>\"For dirt,\" said Ben Buckman, a sales executive with Discovery, Driftwood's developer, who said half the homesites have been sold.</p><p>The Wildcat Club, a new 12.35 acre subdivision in West Lake Hills now under development by Michael+Wes &amp; Co., will offer six luxury homes priced from $10 million to $12 million. Darin Walker of Kuper Sotheby's International Realty, who is marketing the subdivision, said one home has already sold for \"just shy of $10 million.\"</p><p>Justin Nolan, 40, vice president of business development for Argo Blockchain, a London-based cryptocurrency mining company, began looking for homes in Austin last winter, in part because he is developing a bitcoin mining facility in Dickens County, Texas. Mr. Nolan and his wife, Emily Nolan, a freelance television producer, were living with their three young sons in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where they owned a turn-of-the-century brownstone. Although they could have stayed in Brooklyn—Mr. Nolan works from home—the one-two punch of New York City's coronavirus restrictions and its winter weather were too much.</p><p>\"Justin was like, 'I think we gotta get out of here,' \" said Ms. Nolan, 38.</p><p>Although Ms. Nolan had never been to Austin, she and Mr. Nolan thought the city seemed like a good fit for their family.</p><p>\"What really drew us to Austin is while it's Texas, it doesn't have the same reputation as Texas. It's a newer, more tech-friendly city with a lot of young people,\" Mr. Nolan said.</p><p>Mr. Nolan saw a house he liked. By the time he called the listing agent, it had sold. But the broker told him about an off-market listing that he had heard about at lunch that day: a 7,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style home with five bedrooms and a pool in Rollingwood, five minutes from downtown Austin. The owner had already gotten two offers on the house and was going to pick one that evening.</p><p>\"We had six hours,\" said Mr. Nolan, who offered the full asking price for the house after he and Ms. Nolan watched a video walk-through that day.</p><p>Mr. Nolan declined to say what he paid for the house. Comparable homes in Rollingwood are priced between $4.5 million and $5.5 million, said Mr. Walker, who wasn't involved with the sale. \"Prices have skyrocketed,\" he added. \"People are paying $2 million to $2.5 million for a teardown on a 0.4-acre or 0.3-acre lot.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you relocate to Austin?</p><p>The Nolans, who sold their Brooklyn brownstone for $5.9 million in July, public records show, said that the lifestyle upgrade—and the absence of a state income tax—were worth the cost. \"In Austin, you're not really saving much moving to where we moved, but the cost of life is 40% less than New York City,\" said Mr. Nolan. \"And everyone here is incredibly friendly. It's almost disconcerting as a New Yorker to drive down any road and not have people honking at you. No one honks here.\" </p><p>Emily Nolan climbs the spiral staircase in her home, which has a playroom, a home gym and an outdoor pool.

At the orientation, the principal asked families that were new to Austin to raise their hand. \"Half the room raised their hand,\" said Ms. Nolan.</p><p>Part of what makes Austin so appealing to out-of-state migrants is its Texas-lite vibe: a blue dot in a deep-red state whose unofficial slogan is, \"Keep Austin Weird.\" A university town, it abounds in live music venues and yoga studios.</p><p>\"It's like Americana, but hippy-dippy,\" said Eliza Allen, a 35-year-old attorney who moved to Austin's Allandale neighborhood from Brooklyn with her husband, Greg Allen, 36, a tech entrepreneur in November 2020.</p><p>Although the Allens said they have been welcomed by their new community, there have been occasional moments of tension. \"Housing prices are going up, and Austin is less affordable than it was,\" Mr. Allen said. \"People who have been here a long time have frustration with people coming here and trying to change things, to make it like New York or San Francisco, because it's not that. We've come here to be a part of Austin, and that's much more appreciated.\"</p><p>The Allens, who have a 3-year-old daughter, bought a four-bedroom home that was under construction in the Allandale neighborhood after viewing it on a FaceTime tour with their real-estate agent and Alan Lane, the builder. The home, a 2,811-square-foot spec house, was listed at $1.3 million. The Allens got it for $1.401 million, beating a competing offer.</p><p>Mr. Lane, owner of Austin-based Tusker Development, said comparable homes now under construction will be priced at just under $2 million. Not long after the Allens closed on the house, he said, the housing market \"absolutely exploded.\"</p><p>\"I was kind of kicking myself,\" Mr. Lane said. \"Had I finished it, I could have sold it for a lot more.\"</p><p>Austin's Texas-Size Luxury Housing Boom</p>",
