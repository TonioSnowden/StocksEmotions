  "text": "<p>As the pandemic eases and the U.S. economy reopens, a booming housing market is supporting sales-growth trends, which were initially fueled by consumers stocking up and doing home projects.</p><p>\"As home values grow, people feel good about investing in their home overall,\" Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call with analysts. \"That alone is, I think, a very positive outlook for home improvement as you move forward.\"</p><p>Sales for the Atlanta-based home-improvement retailer climbed to $37.5 billion in the three months ended May 2, from $28.26 billion in last year's fiscal first quarter. Profit rose to $4.15 billion, or $3.86 a share, from $2.25 billion, or $2.08 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>Wall Street analysts had forecast sales of $34.82 billion and profit of $3.02 a share, according to a FactSet survey.</p><p>On a comparable-store basis, the company's sales rose 31%, including a 30% climb in the U.S.</p><p>In the first two weeks of May, U.S. comparable sales growth was greater than 30% compared with 2019 levels, a sign that pandemic-era shopping trends have continued, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told analysts.</p><p>Some Wall Street analysts said Tuesday that the stronger-than-expected results would likely lead to higher consensus estimates for Home Depot's performance in coming quarters.</p><p>Lumber -- often cited in recent months by investors and businesses as a contributor to inflation concerns -- has continued to fly off shelves amid rising prices, Ted Decker, Home Depot's operating chief, said on the call.</p><p>\"As soon as that product hits our stores, it sells,\" Mr. Decker said. He cited sawmill capacity as a supply-chain bottleneck that was contributing to higher prices.</p><p>Input prices also have been rising in other categories, Mr. McPhail said in an interview.</p><p>\"We are seeing cost pressures in this environment just like everyone is. Supply chains are pressured, transportation is pressured,\" Mr. McPhail said.</p><p>He added that the company has been working with vendors and managing retail prices to keep products cost effective for customers.</p><p>Big-ticket sales -- transactions above $1,000 -- also indicated a strong willingness by shoppers to spend on home improvement, rising by about 50% on a comparable basis year over year. The average ticket rose to $82.37, from $74.70 in last year's first quarter. Home Depot's tally of customer transactions rose to 447.2 million in the quarter, from 374.8 million a year earlier.</p><p>Even as much in-person retail evaporated last spring, Home Depot worked to keep its stores open, arguing that it should be considered an essential retailer.</p><p>In the year since, it also has benefited from the strong housing market and government policies such as enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks that have supported consumer spending.</p><p>As a Covid-19 vaccination campaign has eased the pandemic's caseload this spring, consumer behavior is evolving once more. In April, U.S. retail sales were flat from March, representing a plateau following seasonally adjusted growth from the pandemic's worst months.</p>",
