  "title": "Home Depot Sales Up 5.6% in Third Quarter; Home-improvement retailer logs logs higher sales despite fewer transactions",
  "text": "<p>This is the sixth consecutive quarter in which fewer, higher-dollar transactions have pushed Home Depot's top line higher, following a surge in demand for home-improvement activity during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Chief Executive Ted Decker said on an earnings call that transactions have been stronger than the company initially expected in light of rising inflation, noting that \"price sensitivity wasn't as strong as we thought it would be.\"</p><p>Revenue came in at $38.87 billion, topping analyst estimates of $37.95 billion, with comparable sales, which strip out store closures and openings, rising 4.3% from last year.</p><p>That trend continued in the third quarter, with Home Depot's project business remaining strong across most departments even as demand in certain products and categories decelerated, Mr. Decker said. Big-ticket transactions, or ones worth more than $1,000, were up 10.1% from a year earlier.</p><p>While rising mortgage rates have slowed the previously white-hot housing market, Home Depot executives said demand for renovation projects has only strengthened as more consumers opt out of moving and instead build on their already-soaring home values.</p><p>Home Depot customers have been more resilient than most to the strain of inflation on consumer spending, Mr. Decker said. \"Our customer tends to have a good job, growing wages, strong balance sheets. They own their home and have seen increased home equity,\" he said.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Walmart Inc. on Tuesday also reported an increase in sales in the latest quarter, a sign that its reputation for low prices is attracting shoppers in a high-inflation environment. The big-box chain, which tends to attract lower-income consumers, logged an 8.2% rise in comparable sales in the U.S., while customer visits increased 2.1%.</p><p>For its quarter ended Oct. 30, Home Depot posted net earnings of $4.3 billion, or $4.24 a share, compared with $4.1 billion, or $3.92 a share a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $4.12 a share.</p><p>Shares closed at $311.93, down 1.63% Tuesday. The stock is down 25% year to date.</p><p>Home Depot's top rival, Lowe's Cos., is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Home Depot Sales Up 5.6% in Third Quarter</p>",
