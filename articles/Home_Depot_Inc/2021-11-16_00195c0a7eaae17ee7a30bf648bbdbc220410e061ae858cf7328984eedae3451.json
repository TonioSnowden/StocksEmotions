  "title": "Stock Futures Flat Ahead of Walmart Earnings, Retail Data; Investors look for clues about how consumers have responded to high inflation, with results due from Home Depot and Walmart",
  "text": "<p>Markets have lost the momentum that propelled stocks to a series of records earlier in the fall. Investors are preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by next summer to check the pace of consumer-price growth, which is running at a three-decade high. Higher rates could knock stocks and other riskier assets that have benefited from 18 months of stimulus from the central bank.</p><p>\"We're moving towards a period now of maybe a bit more volatility,\" said Frank Ã˜land Winther, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, pointing to Covid-19 cases in Europe, trouble in China's property sector and inflation in the U.S. as potential challenges for the market. \"The returns we have seen this year so far just cannot continue.\"</p><p>Another concern for money managers is that inflation will cool the economy of its own accord by acting as a brake on consumers. A bevvy of reports due Tuesday will help investors assess whether Americans stepped up spending again this fall or pulled back.</p><p>Walmart and Home Depot are scheduled to file earnings for the third quarter before the opening bell. Then, at 8:30 a.m. ET, data are expected to show retail sales rose in October, boosted in part by a rebound in auto sales.</p><p>\"Of course, with this elevated inflation, we see an impact on people's purchasing power,\" said Mr. Winther. Danske is considering trimming its holdings of U.S. stocks and shifting some of the money into investment-grade corporate bonds, he said.</p><p>In the bond market, yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.605% Tuesday from 1.621% Monday. Yields, which move in the opposite direction to bond prices, posted their biggest three-day advance through Monday since November 2020.</p><p>In one sign that riskier assets are losing momentum, cryptocurrencies retreated. Bitcoin fell 5.4% to $60,405.99 and ether lost 6.4% to trade at $4,278.78.</p><p>Figures on industrial production, scheduled for 9:15 a.m., will give another perspective on the economy. Production, which covers output at factories, mines and utilities, pulled back in September as supply-chain disruptions crimped activity.</p><p>Energy prices rose Tuesday. Brent crude, the benchmark in oil markets, gained 1% to $82.29 a barrel. Natural gas prices climbed 1.7% in the U.S. to $5.19 per million British thermal units, and 5.3% in Europe.</p><p>Gold prices rose 0.1% to $1,869 a troy ounce. The precious metal has rallied to five-month highs in a sign of growing unease about the inflation outlook.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. Gains for telecom and auto stocks pushed the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.1%. Vodafone Group rose more than 5% after the U.K. telecom company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp jumped 5.4% after a media report said the German conglomerate was looking to list its electrolysis unit.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Flat Ahead of Walmart Earnings, Retail Data</p>",
