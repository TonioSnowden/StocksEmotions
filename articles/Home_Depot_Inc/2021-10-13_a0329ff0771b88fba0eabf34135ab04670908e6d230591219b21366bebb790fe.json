Once the transaction is complete, Berger and other Diamond Direct executives will invest in Signet shares.</p><p>Signet has also raised its full-year guidance.</p><p>See: Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other large retailers are chartering ships to bypass supply chain problems. Will the strategy save Christmas?</p><p>“Customers are showing positive response to our new product launches, and the reduction in government stimulus and customer shift to spending on entertainment and travel are having less impact than we previously anticipated,” said Joan Hilson, Signet's chief financial and strategy officer, in a statement.</p><p>“While there remain factors beyond our control, our strengthened supply chain and vendor partnerships gave us the ability to plan earlier receipt of holiday product, and we currently do not expect any material supply chain disruptions. Signet uses air freight for the transit of the vast majority of our merchandise, thus avoiding current ocean freight congestion.”</p><p>Signet is now guiding for third-quarter revenue of $1.42 billion to $1.45 billion, up from $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion and same-store sales growth of 10% to 12%, up from previous guidance of a 3% decline to 1% increase.</p><p>The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $1.28 billion and same-store sales growth of 0.7%.</p><p>And: Weight gain during COVID-19, especially among younger consumers, is driving changes in the way Americans eat and dress</p><p>For the full-year, Signet is guiding for revenue of $7.04 billion to $7.19 billion, up from $6.80 billion to $6.95 billion, and same-store sales growth of 35% to 38%, up from 30% to 33% growth.</p><p>The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $6.95 billion and same-store sales growth of 36.8%.</p><p>The company also plans to close more than 100 locations in fiscal 2022 and open 100, primarily Banter by Piercing Pagoda shops.
