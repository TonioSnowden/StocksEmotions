  "text": "<p>   Midmarket investor Roark Capital plans to commit at least $125 million to its latest buyout fund, according to a publicly available document from the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana. </p><p>   The Atlanta-based firm plans to amass $5 billion for the new fund, Roark Capital Partners VI LP. </p><p>   Roark plans to invest the fund in 10 to 15 franchise and multilocation businesses in the food-and-restaurant, business services, specialty retail and retail healthcare sectors, the Louisiana document shows. </p><p>   The company's largest share of investments from previous funds is in food-and-restaurant companies. </p><p>   At the end of last June, the food-and-restaurant sector accounted for nearly 86% of investments made by predecessor fund Roark Capital Partners V LP, which closed on $4.88 billion in 2018, the document shows. Roughly 66% of Roark Capital Partners IV LP, which wrapped up with $2.65 billion in 2014, went into the sector, the document indicates. </p><p>   The firm's fifth flagship fund had produced a total value of 1.2 times  paid-in capital and a net internal rate of return of 10.5% from three investments at the end of last June, the document shows. Roark has $19 billion of assets under management. </p><p>   The $24 billion public pension system for Louisiana educators approved a commitment of $50 million to the new fund at a meeting of the system's board of trustees last week. </p><p>   The latest fund will target 10 to 15 investments, committing between $50 million and $1.25 billion in companies with enterprise values of $50 million to $5 billion, according to the document. The fund expects to hold its investments for a period of five to eight years. </p><p>   Roark made several investments last year, including backing an $11.3 billion deal by portfolio company Inspire Brands Inc. to buy doughnut shop chain Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. and a $1.55 billion carve-out of Memphis, Tenn.-based ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc.'s building cleaning and restoration services brands. </p><p>   Since its last fundraising campaign, Roark has added four managing directors to its 15-person investment committee: Kevin Hofmann, a former president and chief marketing officer at retailer Home Depot Inc.; Sarah Spiegel, a former chief executive of bagel and coffee chains; David Wierman, a former managing director with investment bank Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.; and Nate Boaz, a former group operating officer with professional services firm Accenture Inc.'s strategy practice. </p><p></p>",
