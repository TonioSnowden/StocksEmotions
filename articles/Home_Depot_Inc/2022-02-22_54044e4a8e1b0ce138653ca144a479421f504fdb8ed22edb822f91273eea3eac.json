  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, bond yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting 1.944%, up from 1.930% on Friday.</p><p>Stocks and bonds were whipsawed by the latest escalation of tensions in Eastern Europe. Russian forces entered two separatist-controlled regions in Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions. The U.S. fears Russia, which has moved about 190,000 troops to the Ukrainian border, is seeking a pretext to launch an all-out assault on its neighbor, something Russia has denied.</p><p>The White House said President Biden \"strongly condemned\" Mr. Putin's decision and planned to issue sanctions. The European Union says it will follow with its own punitive measures, including a proposed ban on purchases of Russian bonds, among other sanctions. Germany added it has halted moves to open a natural-gas pipeline to Europe that would bypass Ukraine, helping to send energy prices sharply higher.</p><p>\"Investors are de-risking as the situation escalates and uncertainty builds regarding the path forward,\" said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist for Ally Invest. \"Markets are likely to be on edge for the next several weeks.\"</p><p>Investors fear a war between Russia and Ukraine could disrupt commodities supplies, when inflationary pressures are already weighing on growth and prompting central banks to tighten monetary policy. A conflict threatens to crimp access to Russian gas and disrupt the region's sizable trade in agricultural commodities.</p><p>Ms. Bell added geopolitical tensions tend to have a dramatic, immediate effect on markets, but the shock usually wears off over time. Besides higher oil prices, Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine isn't likely to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy, she said.</p><p>Investors, for their part, appeared to focus on the U.S. economy. Shares of Home Depot fell 8.4% after the company posted slightly slower sales growth than it did earlier in the pandemic, making it the biggest drag on the price-weighted Dow.</p><p>Other retail stocks followed, including Best Buy, Lowe's and Dollar General, all falling more than 2% in recent trading. Makers of household durables, including Whirlpool and D.R. Horton, also fell alongside shares of hotels, restaurants and leisure companies.</p><p>Shares of Macy's fell 0.6% despite posting better-than-expected earnings. SoFi Technologies shed 8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it was buying banking-software maker Technisys for about $1.1 billion.</p><p>Technology stocks turned lower midday as investors backed away from riskier corners of the market, sending the sector down 0.5% in the S&amp;P 500. Communication stocks also fell 0.5%.</p><p>Meanwhile, energy stocks in the index rose 0.1%, likely benefitting from the pickup in oil prices. Financial stocks got a boost from higher bond yields, which tend to help make lending more profitable, with the sector adding 0.3%.</p><p>Shares of real-estate firms and utilities, both of which tend to pay healthy dividends, also were higher, gaining 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively.</p><p>Elsewhere, Russia's benchmark MOEX stock index edged up 1.6%, turning higher after the sanctions unveiled in the EU and U.K. didn't target Russia's biggest banks. The index dropped 10.5% Monday, which was its biggest daily percentage decline in almost eight years. The ruble edged higher against the dollar after falling to its lowest level since February 2020.</p><p>European stock indexes reversed earlier sharp losses, with the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.1%. Asia's benchmark indexes closed lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng indexes down 2.7% and Japan's Nikkei 1.7% lower.</p><p>\"Investors have switched from thinking it is posturing, saber-rattling to thinking there has become a real threat of a conflict,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy and research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"Things have gotten to a point where it feels like it is hard to step back from.\"</p><p>WSJ's 2022 tax guide</p><p>* Find out what has changed in taxes and what it means for you.</p><p>â€”Megumi Fujikawa, Quentin Webb and Rebecca Feng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slide After Russian Troops Enter Ukraine</p>",
