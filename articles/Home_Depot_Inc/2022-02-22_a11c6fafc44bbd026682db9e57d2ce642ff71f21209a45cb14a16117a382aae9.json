  "text": "<p>* SoFi Technologies slipped 2.6% ahead of the bell. The lender is buying banking-software maker Technisys for about $1.1 billion, the latest in a string of deals designed to transform it into a one-stop financial shop.</p><p>* Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the blank-check company that is merging with Donald Trump's social-media venture, surged 19%. The platform, Truth Social, has gone live in the U.S., but some would-be users reported being unable to create an account or received error messages when trying to do so. Others were prompted to join a wait list.</p><p>* Home Depot edged down 1.1% after its earnings report. The home-improvement retailer logged faster-than-expected sales growth in the three months through January and raised its dividend.</p><p>* Macy's jumped 6.7%.

Apple ticked down 0.8% premarket, Tesla slipped 2.3%, Microsoft fell 0.9%, Alphabet shed 0.4% and Meta Platforms was down 1.4%</p><p>* McDonald's shed 0.3% premarket. Carl Icahn has launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald's, as the activist investor pushes the fast-food chain to require its suppliers to change their treatment of pigs.</p><p>* DraftKings shares dropped 5.3% premarket. Both Needham and Wells Fargo cut their price targets for the stock.</p><p>* Unisys fell 4.5% off hours.
