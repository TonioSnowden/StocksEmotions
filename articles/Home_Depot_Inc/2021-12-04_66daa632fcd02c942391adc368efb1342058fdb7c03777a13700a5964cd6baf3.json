  "text": "<p>   Peggy Noonan's \"Social Distancing Was a Problem Before Covid\" (Declarations, Nov. 27) brings to light much about concerning trends in marriage, child rearing and socialization. One related point, however, was left out: The female instinct to nurture has not disappeared -- it has been transferred in many cases from children to dogs. </p><p>   U.S. spending on pets has doubled from about $50 billion in 2010 to over $100 billion in 2020. Pets go to Home Depot. They're on planes. They walk the aisles of grocery stores. They are ring bearers at weddings. They have all types of insurance. </p><p>   I was in my dentist's waiting room when another patient came in with her lap dog. I asked her, \"Does the doctor do dog teeth now?\" She replied, \"Oh, no, but having him with me reduces my stress level at the dentist.\" </p><p>   I am not sure when it began, but recent generations stopped naming dogs Spot, Spike and Sparky. Instead, human names became prominent -- the start of the anthropomorphic trend, maybe? </p><p>   Dan Gallagher </p><p>   Bonita Springs, Fla. </p><p></p>",
