  "text": "<p>New York state and city officials said Thursday they were assessing the damage and called the speed of the rainfall unprecedented.</p><p>The crisis unfolded quickly. On Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service warned that Ida's remnants could cause potential flash flooding in urban and poor drainage areas, with rain falling as fast as 1 to 2 inches an hour in the region. The service's New York City station issued a flash-flood warning in a tweet at 6:51 p.m., and at 9:28 p.m. issued its first-ever flash-flood emergency for New York City, warning of a \"life-threatening situation,\" potentially affecting nine million people.</p><p>Central Park experienced 3.15 inches of rain in one hour Wednesday evening, forecasters said, the highest amount on record.</p><p>The flooding occurred at the tail end of an abnormally wet summer, when the ground was already saturated, forecasters said.</p><p>\"This is one for the record booksâ€”you'll be telling your grandkids how you went through this,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a Thursday morning interview on NY1.</p><p>Seven people died as a result of the severe weather, including a 2-year-old boy, the New York Police Department said. Separately, a 70-year-old person died in Passaic, N.J., after being trapped in a vehicle when water levels rose more than 6 feet, and two people may have been swept into the rain-swollen Passaic River, Mayor Hector C. Lora told CNN on Thursday.</p><p>Before the storm, city officials cleaned storm drains and took other steps to prepare. \"But no one could predict the impact that this storm would have with such intense rain,\" Mr. Lora said.</p><p>Hurricane Ida was a storm of historic proportions, making landfall Sunday in southeastern Louisiana as a Category 4 storm with winds topping 150 miles per hour. Ida's winds tore down houses, toppled trees and utility poles and decimated the electricity grid in southern Louisiana, leaving more than 900,000 people in the state without power four days after landfall.</p><p>Ida has brought wind and rain as it traveled northeast over Tennessee, the mid-Atlantic region and into the Northeast. On Thursday morning, about 100,000 customers were without power in New York and New Jersey, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks electrical outages.</p><p>\"If you're thinking of going outside, don't,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted as he announced the state of emergency at 11:26 p.m. \"Stay off the subways. Stay off the roads. Don't drive into these heavy waters.\"</p><p>Basements flooded and streets in some pockets filled with more than 2 feet of water, soaking and stranding cars. A Home Depot store in New Rochelle, N.Y., sold out of generators, submersible water pumps and wet-and-dry vacuums within a half hour of the store's 6 a.m. opening, as the sun was barely rising.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said early Thursday that commuter train service into the Hudson Valley was suspended as it worked to recover from the flooding, and service on the Long Island Rail Road was limited. NJ Transit said all rail service except the Atlantic City line was suspended due to the storm impacts.</p><p>New Jersey state offices delayed opening by three hours because of the storm.</p><p>In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency effective late Wednesday and called on people to stay off the roads. Newark Liberty International Airport said it had suspended flights and diverted passengers from ground-level areas that were flooded.</p><p>Flash-flood emergencies were also issued for parts of Pennsylvania, and authorities in the state reduced speed limits on roads to maintain safety.</p><p>In Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River was rising into major flood stage Thursday morning and forecast to rise a few additional feet before cresting, the weather service said.</p><p>Video footage showed tornadoes in several states, including in Bristol, Pa., and Annapolis, Md. The National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, N.J., reported another, while a tornado watch was issued for parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</p><p>ConEdison, which provides power to 10 million people in New York City and Westchester County, reported around 7:30 a.m. that nearly 19,000 customers were without power, mostly in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester counties, where New Rochelle, the village of Mamaroneck and the town of Greenburgh were the hardest hit.</p><p>ConEd said efforts to restore power are complicated by severe flooding that has created dangerous conditions, and potential flooding in underground systems. The equipment must be dried out and tested, the company said.</p><p>Jimmy Vielkind and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com</p><p>Ida Remnants Batter NYC and the Northeast, With Floods Killing at Least Eight</p>",
