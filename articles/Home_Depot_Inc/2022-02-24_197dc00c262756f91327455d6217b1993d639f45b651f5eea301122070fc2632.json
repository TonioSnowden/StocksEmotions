  "text": "<p>    Lowe's Cos. surprised Wall Street with its management of costs and pricing in the latest quarter amid a slowing outlook for the home-improvement sector's sales. </p><p>   Lowe's shares finished 0.2% higher on Wednesday at $215.09 after the company said sales growth will ease this year but projected that its profitability will improve, compared with a 1.8% loss for the S&amp;P 500 index. That came a day after its larger competitor, Home Depot Inc., gave a similar sales outlook for 2022 and saw its shares drop about 9%, the biggest one-day loss for the stock in nearly two years. Home Depot shares closed down another 2.4% Wednesday. </p><p>   Rising wages and supply-chain challenges have made it difficult for businesses in many parts of the economy to increase their margins in recent months. However, Lowe's said its gross margin improved by more than a percentage point in the latest quarter compared with last year. Analysts had been expecting the metric to rise by just a fraction of that amount. </p><p>   That performance drew a contrast with that of Home Depot, whosegross margins have been shrinking, in part because of costs from extensive investments it has been making in its supply chain. </p><p>   Lowe's said that better product pricing relative to costs and better shrink results both contributed to its higher margins. Shrink refers to merchandise that is lost to theft or damage. </p><p>   \"We're just extremely pleased with the performance from a shrink perspective,\" Lowe's finance chief David Denton said. \"I think the store teams and the loss-prevention teams have just done an excellent job of managing that.\" </p><p>   Management of costs and pricing is likely to help gross margin improve again this year, he said. </p><p>   During the pandemic,  demand for home-improvement projects fueled outsize gains for the sector's stocks. Since early March 2020, Lowe's shares have almost doubled, while Home Depot's are up by about 34%. </p><p>   Now, the companies are projecting that sales in 2022 won't likely match the double-digit growth achieved in recent years. </p><p>   Lowe's quarterly sales rose to $21.34 billion, up from a year-earlier $20.31 billion. Comparable sales, a metric that strips out the effects of store openings and closings, increased 5% year over year. </p><p>   The company's profit totaled $1.21 billion, or $1.78 a share, up from $1.32 a share a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting sales of $20.92 billion and earnings of $1.71 a share. </p><p>   Looking ahead, Lowe's said it expects that on a comparable basis, sales in 2022 will register between a 1% decline and a 1% improvement from 2021's levels. The company forecast that profit will grow by approximately 8% to 13%. </p><p></p>",
