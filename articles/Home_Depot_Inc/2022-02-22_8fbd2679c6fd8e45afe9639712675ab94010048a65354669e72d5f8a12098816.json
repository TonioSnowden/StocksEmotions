  "title": "U.S. Stocks Wobble After Russian Troops Enter Ukraine; Brent crude oil rises to eight-year high; Russian stocks continue falling",
  "text": "<p>Stock futures largely fell ahead of the opening bell after Russian forces entered two separatist-controlled regions in Ukraine on Tuesday. The U.S. fears Russia, which has moved about 190,000 troops to the Ukrainian border, is seeking a pretext to launch an all-out assault on its neighbor, something Russia has denied.</p><p>Within an hour of the opening bell though, investors appeared willing to buy shares of technology firms and other growth stocks, corners of the market that tend to be better positioned during periods of economic stress. Gains across the tech, communication and health-care sectors all helped steady major benchmarks in early-morning trading.</p><p>Home Depot shares, meanwhile, were by far the biggest drag on the Dow industrials, falling 6.6% after the company posted slightly slower sales growth than it did earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>Geopolitical tensions were being felt in other markets too. Oil prices jumped, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, rising 0.7%. European natural-gas prices jumped over 9% after Germany suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia's actions. Russia is Europe's largest gas supplier and the pipeline was set to double the volume of Russian gas channeled directly to Germany.</p><p>Meanwhile, bond yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting 1.951%, up from 1.930% on Friday.</p><p>\"Investors have switched from thinking it is posturing, saber-rattling to thinking there has become a real threat of a conflict,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy and research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"Things have gotten to a point where it feels like it is hard to step back from.\"</p><p>Russia's benchmark MOEX stock index fell over 2%, adding to Monday's 10.5% drop, which was its biggest daily percentage decline in almost eight years. The ruble edged higher against the dollar, after falling to its lowest level since February 2020.</p><p>European stock indexes reversed earlier sharp losses, with the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.4%. Asia's benchmark indexes closed lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng indexes down 2.7% and Japan's Nikkei 1.7% lower.</p><p>Investors fear a war between Russia and Ukraine could disrupt commodities supplies, when inflationary pressures are already weighing on growth and prompting central banks to tighten monetary policy. A conflict threatens to crimp access to Russian gas and disrupt the region's sizable trade in agricultural commodities.</p><p>The U.S. is expected to impose fresh sanctions on Russia on Tuesday in response to its latest moves. The European Union proposed a ban on buying Russian bonds and sanctions on three Russian banks. The U.K. sanctioned five banks and three high net-worth individuals.</p><p>Investors fear full-blown conflict between Russia and its neighbor would prompt even stricter sanctions curbing international supplies of Russian oil and metals.</p><p>\"If oil prices rise sharply beyond $100, gasoline prices will rise in the U.S., and inflation will accelerate further, forcing the Fed to consider raising rates at a faster pace,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management in Tokyo.</p><p>In the U.S., the tech and communication sectors of the S&amp;P 500 added 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices added 4.1%, making it one of the S&amp;P 500's biggest gainers. Micron rose 3.3%, while Apple advanced 0.8%.</p><p>Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2%, likely benefitting from the pickup in oil prices. Financial stocks got a boost from higher bond yields, which tends to help make lending more profitable, with the sector adding 0.4%.</p><p>Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500's consumer staples, consumer discretionary and material sectors were all in the red.</p><p>Corporate events, such as earnings, were also a factor behind some of the market's biggest moves. Shares of Macy's rose 8.4% after the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings. SoFi Technologies fell 2.7% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it was buying banking-software maker Technisys for about $1.1 billion.</p><p>WSJ's 2022 tax guide</p><p>* Find out what has changed in taxes and what it means for you.</p><p>In Hong Kong, concerns about regulation weighed on Chinese internet stocks, with Alibaba Group's shares falling more than 3% and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropping 2.8%. Meituan, whose shares tumbled Friday after the government ordered cuts to the fees that online platforms charge restaurants, fell another 5.6%.</p><p>â€”Michael Wursthorn, Quentin Webb and Rebecca Feng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Wobble After Russian Troops Enter Ukraine</p>",
