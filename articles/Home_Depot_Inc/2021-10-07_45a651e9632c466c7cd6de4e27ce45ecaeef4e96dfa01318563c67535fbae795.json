  "title": "Weight gain during COVID-19, especially among younger consumers, is driving changes in the way Americans eat and dress",
  "text": "<p>The bank's credit analysts cite data sources showing an average American weight gain of 1.5 to 2 pounds per month during the lockdown with younger consumers, including millennials, gaining more than Gen X and boomers. Weight gain has also skewed higher for those who were under lockdown restrictions for a longer period of time.</p><p>Many companies have said they expect that certain dining habits developed during COVID will stick around once the pandemic is over, such as eating at home.</p><p>Read:‘The Covid 15?' If only — this is how much weight the average person actually gained during the pandemic </p><p>“In 2018, if we had proposed that Millennial and Generation Z demographics would have a preference for higher caloric packaged food and would gain a significant amount of weight, it would not have been taken seriously,” analysts led by Hale Holden wrote.</p><p>“A reversion to a preference for healthier fresh food could have implications for allthe center-of-store manufacturers that got a ‘second lease on life' in the past 18 months.”</p><p>Before the pandemic, few consumers had a taste for food and drink with high sugar content. </p><p>As the effort to lose those COVID pounds gets under way, Barclays says sugar could become an ESG (environmental, social and governance) cause on par with eco-issues like carbon footprint.</p><p>“While we are starting to see some shifts in areas like sugar content, we have not seen a sharp acceleration in terms of level of adoption, nor have we seen increased sensitivity in holding exposed names,” analysts said.</p><p>“But as ESG sensitivities develop, we think this will increasingly become a greaterfocus.”</p><p>Barclays rates investment-grade bonds issued by General Mills Inc GIS, Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, and Mondelez International MDLZ at underweight.</p><p>Analysts rate WW International's WW high-yield secured bonds that mature in 2029 at overweight.</p><p>New bodies and changing fashion trends will benefit some fashion companies, like Levi Strauss &amp; Co. LEVI which has talked about how the popularity of looser denim styles will benefit that company after years of skinny jeans.</p><p>Analysts expected heightened demand as mobility improved and people headed back to work, events and on vacation. Consumers are also pushing for more size inclusivity, which is driving access to a wider range of sizes, for instance, at Gap Inc. GPS brand Old Navy. Torrid Holdings Inc. CURV, a plus-size retailer, was also among the many IPOs that have taken place this year.</p><p>Shoppers want to update their closets, or need to because of a change in clothing size, though the supply chain could put a damper on that impulse to spend.</p><p>Also: Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other large retailers are chartering ships to bypass supply chain problems. Will the strategy save Christmas?</p><p>See: A pandemic wardrobe purge is sweeping across the country as normal life resumes</p><p>“While it is difficult to predict what will change the course of apparel demand, we think the 2021 holiday sales period could represent a meaningful increase in demand trends,” the report said.</p><p>And with so many people getting rid of clothing they can no longer wear, or no longer want to wear, secondhand businesses like ThredUp Inc. TDUP should see benefits.</p><p>Barclays has overweight ratings on Nordstrom Inc.'s JWN high-yield bonds that mature in 2024, 2027, 2028, 2030 and 2031, an overweight rating on Macy's Inc.'s M high-yield bonds that mature in 2029 and overweight ratings on Gap's high-yield bonds due 2029 and 2031</p><p>The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK and iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG are breakeven for the year to date. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY has gained 14.4%. And the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 17.8% for the period.</p>",
