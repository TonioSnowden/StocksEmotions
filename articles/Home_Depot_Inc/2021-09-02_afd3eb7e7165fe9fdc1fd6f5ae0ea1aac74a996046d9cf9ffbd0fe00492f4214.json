  "title": "Ida Causes Massive Flooding, Killing at Least 40 in Northeast; Post-tropical cyclone drops more than 3 inches of rain in an hour in New York City",
  "text": "<p>The flooding stranded hundreds of New Yorkers in cars and subway trains late Wednesday into Thursday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. Twelve people died from flooding in the city, including 11 in basements of residential homes, city officials said.</p><p>Officials in the region said that they were assessing the damage and called the speed of the rainfall unprecedented.</p><p>\"Even the morning after, we are still uncovering the true depth of the loss,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a news conference Thursday in Queens.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio said the city had very little warning about the ferocity of the storm, noting that throughout most of Wednesday forecasts showed a manageable 3 to 6 inches of rain for the entire day.</p><p>\"I think now we understand that every attempt at projection, bluntly, is failing us,\" he said at the same news conference Thursday. \"We're getting from the very best experts projections that then are made a mockery of in a matter of minutes.\"</p><p>On Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service warned that Ida's remnants could cause scattered to widespread flash flooding in urban and poor drainage areas, with rain falling as fast as 1 to 2 inches an hour in the region. The National Weather Service's New York City station also issued a flash-flood warning in a tweet at 6:51 p.m., and at 9:28 p.m. issued what it said was its first-ever flash-flood emergency for New York City, warning of a \"life-threatening situation,\" potentially affecting nine million people.</p><p>The weather service issued three emergency alerts on New Yorkers' cellphones between 9 p.m. and 11:55 p.m. Wednesday, warning of flash floods.</p><p>Central Park experienced 3.15 inches of rain in one hour Wednesday evening, forecasters said, the highest amount on record.</p><p>Authorities in New York City urged residents to keep nonemergency vehicles off the streets and highways, after a travel ban expired at 5 a.m. Thursday. Subway service was limited for the morning commute, with some lines not operating at all due to flooding in stations.</p><p>The flooding occurred at the tail end of an unusually wet summer, when the ground was already saturated, forecasters said.</p><p>Phamatee Ramskriet, 43 years old, and her 22-year-old son, Khrishah Ramskriet, died in their basement apartment of a colonial house in Hollis, Queens, when their block flooded shortly after 10 p.m. Wednesday, according to New York Police Department officials. Mahen Singh, a neighbor of the victims, said he was on his porch when the water levels on his block rose to 4 feet from 1 inch in about five minutes.</p><p>\"I have never seen that happen,\" said Mr. Singh, who has lived on the street for 29 years. Ms. Ramskriet's husband and their other son were outside their home when the flooding started and called police when they realized their family members were trapped inside, Mr. Singh said. Firefighters tried to enter the apartment, but rescue crews didn't recover the bodies until the water levels dissipated after an hour, he said.</p><p>\"He was in total shock,\" Mr. Singh said of the husband.</p><p>In New Jersey, authorities reported six deaths. Among them were four people found dead by firefighters in an Elizabeth, N.J. apartment complex, according to city spokeswoman Kelly Martins. The deceased included a married couple in their early 70s, their 38-year-old son and a 33-year-old neighbor. Ms. Martins said she didn't know the cause of the deaths but said the area had flooded, and the fire headquarters building across the street had about 8 feet of water.</p><p>Three people died in Montgomery County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, said Valerie Arkoosh, chairwoman of the county board of commissioners. She said two victims apparently drowned, and the third fatality was due to structural damage. Emergency crews have conducted more than 450 water rescues—more than triple the previous record for a storm of this type—and some continued Thursday morning, she said. The county received more than 8 inches of rain, she said.</p><p>Pennsylvania state officials said Thursday that 376 roads, including parts of some interstate highways, were closed because of flooding or downed power lines and trees.</p><p>In Rockville, Md., officials said a 19-year-old man was found dead at an apartment complex that flooded Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Hurricane Ida was a storm of historic proportions, making landfall Sunday in southeastern Louisiana as a Category 4 storm with winds topping 150 miles an hour. Ida's winds tore down houses, toppled trees and utility poles and decimated the electricity grid in southern Louisiana, leaving more than 900,000 people in the state without power four days after landfall.</p><p>Ida has brought wind and rain as it traveled northeast over Tennessee, the mid-Atlantic region and into the Northeast. On Thursday morning, more than 60,000 customers were without power in New Jersey, more than 87,000 in Pennsylvania and more than 30,000 in New York, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks electrical outages.</p><p>\"If you're thinking of going outside, don't,\" New York's Mr. de Blasio tweeted as he announced the state of emergency at 11:26 p.m. \"Stay off the subways. Stay off the roads. Don't drive into these heavy waters.\"</p><p>Basements flooded and streets in some pockets filled with more than 2 feet of water, soaking and stranding cars. A Home Depot store in New Rochelle, N.Y., sold out of generators, submersible water pumps and wet-and-dry vacuums within a half-hour of the store's 6 a.m. opening, as the sun was barely rising.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said early Thursday that commuter train service into the Hudson Valley was suspended as it worked to recover from the flooding, and service on the Long Island Rail Road was limited. NJ Transit said all rail service except the Atlantic City line was suspended due to the storm impacts.</p><p>In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency effective late Wednesday and called on people to stay off the roads. Newark Liberty International Airport said it had suspended flights and diverted passengers from ground-level areas that were flooded. Some school districts in New Jersey canceled classes Thursday.</p><p>\"An extraordinary, sadly tragic, historic 24 hours in New Jersey, there's no other way to put it,\" Mr. Murphy said during a news conference in front of tornado-damaged homes in the South Jersey community of Mullica Hill.</p><p>Michael Wright and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com and Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com</p><p>Ida Causes Massive Flooding, Killing at Least 40 in Northeast</p>",
