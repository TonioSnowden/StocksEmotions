  "title": "What CEOs Are Saying: 'There's Higher Cyberattack Sensitivity'; Leaders from Home Depot, Block, Zscaler and other companies share their thoughts about the Ukraine, inflation and the consumer",
  "text": "<p>Curtiss-Wright Corp. Chief Executive Lynn M. Bamford:</p><p>\"If you look into today's Europe, it's very significantly dependent on Russian natural gas.…The events of today—however, this plays out in Ukraine, and we surely hope it plays out well for the Ukrainian people—but I think will surely increase the resolve of nations to want to have that energy independence.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Zscaler Inc. Chief Executive Jay Chaudhry:</p><p>\"It's a little bit early to tell the impact, but our customers are concerned. There's higher cyberattack sensitivity.…And customers want to make sure they're secure.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Monster Beverage Corp. Co-Chief Executive Hilton Schlosberg:</p><p>\"Those countries, including Belarus and Kazakhstan, which really work within that region, account for about 10% of our sales in our EMEA sales. So we have a nice business in Russia, which—we have to see what happens there—and we have a reasonable business in Ukraine. We have staff, and we have people in those countries.…We don't know what will happen, and it's really concerning, frankly.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Dell Technologies Inc. Co-Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke:</p><p>\"Our top priority at this time is supporting our Ukrainian team members as they attempt to relocate to a safe and secure environment. We are closely monitoring things and are working with employees to address their personal and family situations. As for business operations in the region, the situation is rapidly evolving.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Lowe's Cos. Chief Executive Marvin Ellison:</p><p>\"Our outlook for the home-improvement industry remains strong, supported by very healthy consumer balance sheets, especially for homeowners, and continuing home price appreciation. Persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment. In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.\" (Feb. 23)</p><p>Home Depot Inc. Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker:</p><p>\"Everything we hear from our Pro customers is they've got more work than they can handle. I know for myself it took a while to get somebody out to just do simple projects around my house. We hear that all over the country, and so the Pro business backlog is healthy.\" (Feb. 22)</p><p>Six Flags Entertainment Corp. Chief Executive Selim Bassoul:</p><p>\"When inflation moves behind us, we want this pricing to stick as well, and that's key. We're not just riding the inflation curve. We want to make sure that the value is there so that when everything goes back to normal, our guests feel that the pricing—the new pricing—sticks beyond just the inflation.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Live Nation Entertainment Inc. Chief Executive Michael Rapino:</p><p>\"We saw demand drive price increases, particularly with platinum and other front-of-the-house ticket pricing. Fans continued to seek the best tickets, and the ongoing rapid growth of the secondary market indicates there's more room to grow. Fans onsite also continued spending more, with average per fan revenue up double digits for the year relative to 2019 levels.\" (Feb. 23)</p><p>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Frank Del Rio:</p><p>\"The back half of 2022, in spite of Delta and Omicron, is in line with the record year of 2019, and 2023 is meaningfully ahead, meaningfully ahead both in price and in load factor. So, we believe that—if you believe that—the Omicron is the last major surge that's going to cause upheaval in everyday life, then that healing period that I referred to has begun.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Booking Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Glenn Fogel:</p><p>\"When leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel, and we are currently seeing this starting to happen in many parts of the world. While this is a potentially favorable backdrop for 2022, we do expect there will still be periods when Covid negatively impacts travel trends as we move through the current year.\" (Feb. 23)</p><p>TJX Cos. Chief Financial Officer Scott Goldenberg:</p><p>\"Overall, we would expect when you get past this year, that the sum of all of the expense pressures will be significantly less, not back to our pre-Covid levels, but with a level we would need a significantly less average retail increase to be able to cover that compared to what we're seeing this year.\" (Feb. 23)</p><p>Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer Kristy Chipman:</p><p>\"Based on the current inflationary environment, we will be taking an additional price increase in March of approximately 3%. This higher pricing reflects the continued high inflationary environments, the introduction of a new tier in some restaurants and price increases on liquor, beer and wine, a category that we did not take significant price increases on during 2021. Based on our analysis, we believe that the price increase will be accepted by our guests.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Foot Locker Inc. Chief Executive Richard Johnson:</p><p>\"The consumer has shown a tremendous amount of resiliency. As it relates to our specific category, we all wait for the tax return money to start flowing in Q1. So again, I think that there is a lot of upside with our consumer. They have not been hesitant to shop the stores and shop our digital sites.\" (Feb. 25)</p><p>Macy's Inc.Chief Executive Jeff Gennette:</p><p>\"In every scenario we considered, we found that the combination of our profitable digital platform with our national footprint will deliver greater value to shareholders than a separation of our digital and physical assets. This was true at both Macy's Inc. and brand levels.\" (Feb. 22)</p><p>Maple Leaf Foods Inc. President Curtis Frank:</p><p>\"We believe the hyper exposure of the category early on drove a significant number of consumers to trial plant-based protein products.…But consumers' needs simply were not met. And they did not repeat purchases.…All major brands and products across the category are experiencing similar challenges, which largely seems to be driven by consumers' experience in terms of taste, price, degree of processing and ease of preparation.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Beyond Meat Inc. Chief Executive Ethan Brown:</p><p>\"We do not expect certain positive consumer trends that appear related to Covid and that did not favor our category to persist. Chief among these trends were diminished focus on health-oriented eating choices, with consumers opting instead for comfort foods and a reduced openness and ability to trial.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Etsy Inc. Chief Executive Josh Silverman:</p><p>\"While we're facing reopening headwinds we've long anticipated, we see these as short term, with significant tailwinds at our back. In a world that we believe has been forever transformed by the massive adoption of e-commerce, Etsy too has been transformed.…We're now more than 2.5 times bigger than we were before the pandemic.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Block Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey:</p><p>\"We're really excited about bitcoin. We wanted to make it more accessible to everyone. We love your interest about automatically converting your paycheck into bitcoin as well. We're seeing a lot of—and we're partnering with a lot of athletes to do exactly this. Obviously, we want to bring it to everyone.\" (Feb. 24)</p><p>Quotes were obtained from transcripts provided by FactSet and from news releases.</p><p>Write to George Stahl at george.stahl@wsj.com</p><p>What CEOs Are Saying: 'There's Higher Cyberattack Sensitivity'</p>",
