  "title": "Christmas Gifts Are Being Delivered, Biden Says; President touts progress in easing supply chain woes as businesses race to get products to market and shoppers face high prices",
  "text": "<p>\"Most of Santa Claus's products will be delivered to the consumers,\" FedEx Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Smith said at the meeting.</p><p>Still, some makers of toys, games and other consumer goods are racing to figure out how to get products to market, and having to decide which customers will receive orders as stocks run low. Merchants that doubled or tripled orders to have adequate supply run the risk of having excess product after the shopping season.</p><p>The Transportation Department on Thursday is expected to announce an additional $230 million in grants for ports, which have struggled with significant backups due to the global supply chain crunch.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to ease logjams by working with ports in California to move to 24/7 operation, as well as the trucking industry, shipping companies and retailers. It has put a particular focus on semiconductors, the computer chips that are essential to an array of consumer electronics and vehicles.</p><p>At the same time officials have conceded options are limited given global supply chain problems triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Labor shortages persist, including in trucking. Mr. Smith said his company has greatly expanded its package sorting operation but said a lack of workers remains an issue.</p><p>The nation's busiest container port complex in Southern California remains congested. Imports at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach fell in November to their lowest levels since June of 2020, even as a backup of container ships grew. The backup reached a record of more than 100 vessels earlier this month and fell to 91 ships on Tuesday, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California. Container ships at the Los Angeles port are waiting an average 19 days before they can begin unloading cargo.</p><p>U.S. consumer demand has been strong this year, and has been picking up steam heading into the holidays. Sales at online and physical stores rose 14% during the Thanksgiving weekend compared with last year, according to data released by Mastercard SpendingPulse.</p><p>Major companies such as Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. loaded up early on products to ensure items were available for the holidays. Some smaller companies increased orders by double or triple their usual volume in case some orders don't show up on time, or at all.</p><p>Politically, supply chain problems have been a concern for the White House, though earlier fears of bare shelves didn't materialize. Mr. Biden also has to contend with surging inflation, which reached a nearly 40 year high in November. He said Wednesday that addressing rising costs is a priority and pointed to declining gasoline prices as one sign of relief.</p><p>Making more products in the U.S. will alleviate future supply chain disruptions, Mr. Biden said, adding, \"We can never again be left vulnerable the way we were in the early days of Covid-19.\"</p><p>Paul Berger contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com</p><p>Christmas Gifts Are Being Delivered, Biden Says</p>",
