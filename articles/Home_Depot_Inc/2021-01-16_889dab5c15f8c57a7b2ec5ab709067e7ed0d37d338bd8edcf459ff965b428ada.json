  "text": "<p>   The National Association of Manufacturers issued a statement condemning the mayhem and calling on Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump. \"This is sedition and should be treated as such,\" the group's president, Jay Timmons, said in the statement, which sent a shock through its roughly 14,000 company members. </p><p>   NAM board member Nicole Wolter, CEO of HM Manufacturing Inc. in Wauconda, Ill., said she read the statement in surprise. \"I was like, 'Yikes.' The second time I read it, I understood where he's coming from,\" she said. \"This needed to be condemned.\" </p><p>   Lisa Winton, a NAM board member and CEO of Winton Machine Co. in Suwanee, Ga., said she emailed Mr. Timmons supporting the statement. She said she didn't have an opinion on the call to remove Mr. Trump. Ms. Winton said she and her workers in Georgia are exhausted by politics after the long 2020 race and the political-ad blitz leading up to the state's Jan. 5 Senate runoffs. </p><p>   \"No matter who's in office, we need their attention,\" she said of lawmakers, citing small-business loans, job training and solving the Covid-19 crisis as top issues. \"We need them to focus on what's important.\" </p><p>   Canadian e-commerce company Shopify Inc. took stores run by Mr. Trump's business and campaign offline. PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing the risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump; the Trump Organization has said the PGA decision was a \"breach of a binding contract.\" </p><p>   Crowell &amp; Moring LLP Chairman Phil Inglima said the law firm asked about 200 top law firms to sign a statement in support of removing Mr. Trump. Eighteen other law-firm leaders and dozens of individual lawyers signed on. Several of the largest firms declined, with some saying they saw the statement as too political, said people familiar with their decisions. </p><p>   Crowell &amp; Moring sent the statement to Vice President Pence on Jan. 8. \"We don't view this as a political act at all,\" Mr. Inglima said. \"We view this as a defense of the Constitution.\" </p><p>   By Sunday, companies including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Boston Scientific Corp., said they were pausing their political-action committee donations for Republicans and Democrats. Some of the suspensions won't have much impact because the 2022 election cycle won't start for at least six months. </p><p>   Some resisted the tide. CEOs who say they didn't plan to change their funding include Paul Sarvadi of Insperity Inc., a publicly traded HR company in Texas, who has donated to Republicans. \"I'm not thinking about that at this point,\" he said. \"I think it pays for companies to be more deliberate, less reactive.\" </p><p>   By Monday, Jan. 11, more than 40 large companies had said they were reviewing or suspending corporate PAC donations. </p><p>   By then, many businesses were looking ahead to this weekend, when more demonstrations are planned across the country, according to law enforcement. On a Zoom call, about 40 CEOs met to discuss the political uncertainty, according to attendees. Executives talked about the threat of violence in Washington and elsewhere, with CEOs sharing plans to tighten security and step up monitoring of company facilities, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who convened the meeting. </p><p>   IBM on Friday released a slate of \"good government reforms,\" that include updating the presidential-transition process and reiterating its calls for police reform, besides policies, such as financial disclosure laws, that may directly impact its business. \"What companies should be thinking about is policy reforms, not PAC checks,\" IBM wrote. </p><p>   Many business leaders said they were hopeful the new White House would address issues such as federal action on the economy and combating Covid-19. \"Clients across all industries want us to have some return to normalcy,\" said Blair Effron, a Democratic fundraiser who co-leads investment bank Centerview Partners LLC. </p><p>   Home Depot Inc. co-founder Ken Langone, now retired, had previously aligned himself with Mr. Trump. He told CNBC on Wednesday he felt betrayed by the president, vowing to help make Mr. Biden as successful as possible. </p><p>   \"My loyalty is to my presidency. My loyalty is to the public officials that run to serve us,\" he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"I find a lot of things I don't like about Joe Biden, but that's besides the point. It's in my selfish interest for him to be very successful.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Austen Hufford contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
