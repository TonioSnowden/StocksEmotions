  "text": "<p>Joe Biden said he expects to announce his pick for chair of the Federal Reserve in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/795cb6f2-ee29-4b61-ab2f-f8b0b22ba55c#post-355db199-f1bc-4695-bee2-493a29ea13ca\">“about four days”</a>, as pressure builds on the White House to make a decision with less than three months until Jay Powell's term expires.</p> <p>The choice is between Powell, who was appointed by Donald Trump and assumed the role in 2018, and Lael Brainard, a governor who has the backing of progressive members of the Democratic Party for her more stringent stance on regulatory matters.</p> <p>The president recently met with Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8074539-594f-420a-afcc-2d62b8f35a8c\">at the White House</a> but no decision was forthcoming. The incumbent has long been considered the favoured candidate, given his success in guiding the economy through the Covid-19 crisis and his broad-based bipartisan support, which is likely to mean a swift confirmation process.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/9b02eac5-7b8d-4201-9e4d-05b45f9513b5\">the extensive nature</a> of the ongoing debate suggests Biden may be more seriously considering an alternative.</p> <p><em>Thank you for reading FirstFT Americas.
