Last week, stocks surged after the October consumer-price index rose more slowly than expected.</p><p>See: Wholesale prices rise slowly again and point to softening U.S. inflation</p><p>Tuesday's PPI report helped support the notion that inflation has peaked, at least for now. </p><p> \"Bottom line, this data is further confirmation of the peak for now in inflation, evidence that we've been seeing for months. The question still unanswered is where does it settle out when all is said and done,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group.</p><p>In other news, the first face-to-face meeting between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping helped support stocks listed in China and Hong Kong as some of the tensions between the world's two largest economies were seen to be easing.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng HK:HSI jumped 4.1%, taking its gains so far in November to 24.8%, as Chinese listed stocks shrugged off some soft retail sales data and welcomed signs of cooling U.S.-Sino tensions, along with signs that Beijing is preparing to support its beleaguered property sector. There were also more indications that the mainland government would ease COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>The upbeat tone from Asia — which included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TW:2330 jumping 7.8% on news Warren Buffett had boughta $5 billion stake — underpinned European bourses and U.S. futures.</p><p>\"The injection of optimism inserted into the limbs of the financial market after last week's U.S. CPI report showed some signs of fading yesterday although there's been a recovery in Asia as China continues to support the economy and the interpretation of Biden/Xi meeting yesterday is spun a bit more positively in Asia,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Analysts increasingly expect stocks to enjoy a positive end to the year. \"The near-term picture still looks positive for U.S. benchmark indices and while momentum has reached intra-day overbought levels, this doesn't imply a selloff has to happen right away,\" said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"It still looks possible to gain further this week with targets up near SPX 4050-75 and larger targets up near 4120. While I do expect that recent gains will require some consolidation, this might hold off until late week ahead of a push higher post Thanksgiving into early December. Overall, last week's surge keeps trends positive near term,\" Newton added.</p><p>Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker favored a 50 basis-point hike to the Fed's benchmark rate in December in comments made Tuesday morning. He added that he thinks the Fed could afford to pause interest-rate hikes so long as it continues to work toward suppressing inflation.</p><p>Later in the morning, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr said in prepared testimony for the Senate Banking Committee — where he will testify Tuesday starting at 10 a.m. New York time — that the Fed is working with regulators to assess risks tied to cryptocurrency markets following the collapse of FTX and its associated companies.</p><p>In other U.S. economic data, the New York Empire State manufacturing index for November showed a gauge of manufacturing activity in the state rose 13.6 points to 4.5 this month.</p><p>Finally, earnings from some of the largest retailers in the U.S. were released early Tuesday.</p><p>Treasury yields were lower on the day Tuesday, with the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Yoff 6.3 basis points at 3.807%.
