  "text": "<p>Brides- and grooms-to-be are ditching the traditional script and putting a personal spin on everything from the invitations to the afterparty. \"Couples who get married today want a ceremony that reflects who they are as a couple,\" says Mrs. Kay. The menu might feature dishes that reflect the couple's culture or where they grew up. And wedding-party attire—including the wedding dress—is awash in color. Little touches matter, too, such as a personal note written on the place card at each table setting.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which 2022 wedding trends do you hope will pass and which do you hope will stay? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Guests themselves are playing a part. \"If a couple likes to cook, they may offer a cooking class that doubles as a welcome cocktail gathering,\" Mrs. Kay says.</p><p>Personalization applies to wedding gifts, too, with couples increasingly asking for cash and gift cards. According to The Knot 2022 Registry Study, 7 in 10 couples asked for cash, a 10% increase over last year, Mrs. Kay says. \"It gives the couple a lot of freedom.\"</p><p>When asking for cash, funding a honeymoon or home purchase are among the top reasons. Couples who asked for gift cards were most likely to select ones from the Home Depot, Airbnb and Delta Air Lines, an analysis of gift registries created on The Knot found.</p><p>Inflation in 2022 has driven up wedding costs overall, but the average cost this year is still unknown. Last year's average was $28,000 for the ceremony and reception, according to a survey by The Knot of over 15,200 U.S. couples married in 2021.</p><p>To make the affairs more affordable, Mrs. Kay says, couples are now more willing to consider getting married on a weekday, when venues are less expensive. They may also cut back on the types of flowers used and size of the floral arrangements. \"We're also seeing a lot of price shopping,\" she adds. \"If you want to have oyster-shell place cards—where names are written inside the shell—you can take that to an Etsy-type marketplace and ask for a discount for a bulk order.\"</p><p>This year, \"weddings are back, and people are excited to celebrate,\" Mrs. Kay says. In 2023, weddings in the U.S. will likely return to prepandemic levels at 2.1 million, according to internal research from The Knot.</p><p>Ms. DeCarbo is a writer in South Carolina.
