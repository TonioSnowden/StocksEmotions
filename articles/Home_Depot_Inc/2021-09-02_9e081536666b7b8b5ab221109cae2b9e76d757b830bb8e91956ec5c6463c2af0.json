  "text": "<p>Seven fatalities as a result of the severe weather, including a 2-year-old boy, were confirmed by the New York Police Department. Another person died in Passaic, N.J., according to the city's mayor.</p><p>New York's FDR Drive, a major artery on the east side of Manhattan, and the Bronx River Parkway were under water by late Wednesday evening, according to the Associated Press.</p><p>\"If you're thinking of going outside, don't,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted as he announced the state of emergency. \"Stay off the subways. Stay off the roads. Don't drive into these heavy waters.\"</p><p>Central Park experienced 3.15 inches of rain in one hour Wednesday evening, the National Weather Service said, the highest amount on record. The service urged people to move to higher ground in light of the \"extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation.\"</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said early Thursday that train service was extremely limited as it worked to recover from the flooding. Video footage showed water cascading onto subway trains and inundating platforms.</p><p>In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency effective immediately and called on people to stay off the roads. Newark Liberty International Airport said it had suspended flights and diverted passengers from ground-level flooded areas.</p><p>The mayor of Passaic, N.J., Hector C. Lora, said in a video posted on Facebook that one person had died as a result of the storm and that there were unconfirmed reports of further deaths.</p><p>Flash-flood emergencies were also issued for parts of Pennsylvania, and authorities in the state reduced speed limits on roads to maintain safety.</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said in a tweet that some parts of the state could receive more than 8 inches of rain.</p><p>Video footage showed tornadoes in several states, including in Bristol, Pa., and Annapolis, Md. The National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, N.J., reported another, while a tornado watch was issued for parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</p><p>According to PowerOutage.us, more than 200,000 electricity customers were without power across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p><p>The extreme weather comes days after Hurricane Ida struck Louisiana as the most powerful storm in 16 years, causing widespread power outages and flooding, as well as several deaths.</p><p>The National Weather Service said Ida would continue to track northeast, and some areas could receive total rainfall of more than 10 inches.</p><p>In Westchester County, N.Y., thousands were without power Thursday, Con Edison said. More than 8,000 residents in the county lost power around midnight, the utility said, with New Rochelle, the village of Mamaroneck and the town of Greenburgh among the hardest hit.</p><p>Basements flooded and streets in some pockets filled with more than two feet of water, soaking and stranding cars. A Home Depot in New Rochelle sold out of generators, submersible water pumps and wet-and-dry vacuums within a half hour of the store's 6 a.m. opening.</p><p>Efforts to restore power are complicated by severe flooding that has created dangerous conditions, and potential flooding in underground systems, Con Edison said. Before power can be restored, the equipment must be dried out and tested.</p><p>Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Ida Remnants Batter N.Y.C., Northeast, With Floods Killing at Least Eight</p>",
