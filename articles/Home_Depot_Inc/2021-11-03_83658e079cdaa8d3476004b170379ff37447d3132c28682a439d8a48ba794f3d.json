  "title": "Politan Capital Management Has Roughly $900 Million Stake in Centene; Politan is led by veteran activist investor Quentin Koffey",
  "text": "<p>Centene since 1996 has been led by Chief Executive Michael Neidorff, who built up the company from a relatively small player to a dominant force in government managed care. St. Louis-based Centene is the largest provider of health-insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, the largest provider of Medicaid managed care and a major player in the Medicare Advantage sector.</p><p>After a steep yearslong climb, its shares are little-changed in the past three years and have underperformed those of peers like Molina Healthcare Inc. Centene has a market value of just over $41 billion.</p><p>The company at a June investor presentation unveiled a plan to boost its margins, which have lagged behind those of peers. It has also been reviewing the potential divestiture of noncore assets and on Wednesday agreed to sell a majority stake in a small home-healthcare business.</p><p>Politan recommended potential directors including Kenneth Burdick and Wayne DeVeydt, the people said. Mr. Burdick is the former chief executive of WellCare Health Plans Inc., which Centene bought in early 2020 to expand in Medicare Advantage. Mr. DeVeydt is the former chief financial officer of health insurer Anthem Inc. and current executive chairman of surgical-facility operator Surgery Partners Inc. The two are willing to be nominated to Centene's board if needed when the window to do so opens later this month, the people said.</p><p>During Mr. Burdick's five-year tenure at WellCare, the company's shares rose over 300% and he was credited with improving its margins. While at Anthem, Mr. DeVeydt had a hand in its steady stream of deals.</p><p>Mr. Koffey focused on activist investing at D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. and Senator Investment Group LP before establishing Politan this summer. His successful campaigns include one at home-improvement retailer Lowe's Cos., where he teamed up with a former Home Depot director and replaced several board members and executives. Earlier this year, shareholders of real-estate-data provider CoreLogic Inc. elected three directors nominated by Senator and Bill Foley's Cannae Holdings Inc. to its board. CoreLogic later agreed to sell itself to two private-equity firms.</p><p>Centene has attracted activists before. In 2019, Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC took a stake and urged the company to consider selling itself before spending over $15 billion to buy WellCare. Other activist investors including Corvex Management LP and Sachem Head Capital Management also built stakes in Centene around the same time and wanted it to consider alternatives including a sale to Humana Inc.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com</p><p>Politan Capital Management Has Roughly $900 Million Stake in Centene</p>",
