  "title": "The Property Report:  Progress Residential Names New Chief Executive  ----  By Will Parker",
  "text": "<p>   Progress Residential, the single-family rental arm of private-equity shop Pretium Partners, appointed Home Depot Inc. executive Adolfo Villagomez to be its chief executive, the company said. </p><p>   Mr. Villagomez, 49 years old, will succeed Chaz Mueller, who served as Progress's CEO from 2018 until last year, when he retired. </p><p>   The company cited Mr. Villagomez's record of boosting revenue for a consumer-facing business as one reason for his hire. He begins his tenure as CEO next week. </p><p>   Progress is in the midst of growing its large portfolio of rental houses, which it said now numbers more than 80,000, making the company one of the largest rental-home managers in the country. Its recent acquisitions include the purchase of more than 3,000 homes from Zillow Offers, Zillow Group Inc.'s now closed house-flipping unit. </p><p>   Born in Mexico City and trained as a chemical engineer, Mr. Villagomez worked for DuPont and McKinsey &amp; Co. before moving to Home Depot in 2014. He most recently served as the president of Homedepot.com and as the company's chief marketing officer for U.S. retail. </p><p>   Though he hasn't previously worked for a large real-estate company, Mr. Villagomez worked with construction clients at McKinsey and with contractors and large property companies at Home Depot, he said. </p><p>   One of his top goals for the new post is improving tenant experiences, Mr. Villagomez said. </p><p>   \"Other industries have gone through this transformation of delivering a personalized experience that customers love. I think it's time for the single family-rental business to accelerate that and provide this to our residents,\" he said. </p><p>   During the pandemic the single-family rental industry has been flush with investment capital and investor buyers now account for the greatest share of U.S. home sales that they ever have, according to real-estate company Redfin. Some investors, including Pretium, are also putting large sums into the construction of new single-family homes that are rented instead of sold. </p><p></p>",
