  "text": "<p>Walmart <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/664f16d0-2faf-4b7b-af72-236e370dbd08\">issued its second profit warning in 10 weeks</a> after the market closed yesterday, saying inflation was weighing on price-sensitive consumers.</p> <p>“The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend,” said Walmart's chief executive Doug McMillon in a statement. </p> <p>He said Walmart was having to cut prices to move inventory, especially clothing. </p> <p>Walmart's warning sent its shares down almost 10 per cent to $118.97 in after-hours trading, cutting about $35bn from its stock market capitalisation. That prompted a sell-off in shares of rivals including Target, Costco and Home Depot, while those of Amazon fell more than 4 per cent.</p> <p>In May, Walmart shares suffered their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bd41174-6f7c-4152-9fa0-4a11f2a0ed05\">biggest one-day drop since 1987</a> when it cut guidance for the coming quarters for the first time. Its shares have fallen 8.7 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 17 per cent decline for the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>Investors have grown increasingly concerned that retailers will have to discount unsold products as rising prices and a shift in spending from goods to services hits sales.</p> <p>Amazon said yesterday it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18a5c0df-cd83-449f-a5aa-95c434641a09\">pass on rising prices in Europe</a> to customers and increase the cost of its popular Prime membership scheme, several months after doing the same for US customers. </p> <p>The company attributed the move to “increased inflation and operating costs”. </p> <p>Walmart, which is due to report earnings for the April to June period in three weeks, said operating income would fall 13 to 14 per cent for the quarter as it discounted merchandise to clear excess inventory. For the full year, the company said operating income would fall between 11 and 13 per cent. </p> <p>As with other US multinationals, Walmart is also suffering from the strength of the dollar which led to a “headwind” of $1bn in the second quarter and, based on current exchange rates, would add $1.8bn of extra costs in the second half of the year, it said.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas. Here's the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

Taiwan fears fallout from planned Nancy Pelosi visit</strong> The pushback from the White House against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned visit to Taiwan has sparked anxiety in Taipei that the controversy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8145aa97-1c46-4e5e-9ec8-1afa139a4a54\">will further compromise its security</a>. People familiar with the situation in Taipei said the US administration's public opposition to the trip threatened to embolden Beijing.</p> <p><strong>3.

A snap poll of 1,000 voters found that Sunak only narrowly edged the contest by 39 to 38 per cent.
