  "title": "Inside a $45 Billion  Retail Crime Spree  ---  Thieves sell their hauls online; a CVS  investigator combats the boom  ----  By Rebecca Ballhaus and Shalini Ramachandran",
  "text": "<p>   Ben Dugan sat in an unmarked sedan in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood one day last September waiting for the CVS to be robbed. </p><p>   He tracked a man entering the store and watched as the thief stuffed more than $1,000 of allergy medicine into a trash bag, walked out and did the same at two other nearby stores, before loading them into a waiting van, Mr. Dugan recalled. </p><p>   The target was no ordinary shoplifter. He was part of a network of organized professionals, known as boosters, whom CVS had been monitoring for weeks. The company believed the group responsible for stealing almost $50 million in products over five years from dozens of stores in Northern California. The job for Mr. Dugan, CVS Health Corp.'s top investigator, was to stop them. </p><p>   Retailers are spending millions a year to battle organized crime rings that steal from their stores in bulk and then peddle the goods online, often on Amazon.com Inc.'s retail platform, according to retail investigators, law-enforcement officers and court documents. It is a menace that has been supercharged by the pandemic and the rapid growth of online commerce that has accompanied it. </p><p>   \"We're trying to control it the best we can, but it's growing every day,\" said Mr. Dugan. </p><p>   The Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail, a trade association, which Mr. Dugan heads, estimates organized retail theft accounts for around $45 billion in annual losses for retailers, up from $30 billion a decade ago. At CVS, reported thefts have ballooned 30% since the pandemic began. </p><p>   Mr. Dugan's team, working with law enforcement, expects to close 73 e-commerce cases this year involving $104 million of goods stolen from multiple retailers and sold on Amazon. That compares with 27 cases in 2020, involving half the total. </p><p>   Home Depot Inc. says the number of its investigations into these kinds of criminal networks has grown 86% since 2016.  \"The digital world has become a pretty easy way to move this product,\" Home Depot Chairman and CEO Craig Menear told investors in 2019. </p><p>   Target Corp., Ulta Beauty Inc. and TJX Cos., which includes TJ Maxx and Marshalls, have also bulked up their resources. </p><p>   Complicating the battle is Amazon itself, which investigators and law-enforcement officials say is one of the biggest outlets for criminal networks, given its huge pool of potential customers and, in investigators' view, insufficient vetting of sellers or their listings. </p><p>   Investigators say they struggle to obtain information about potentially illicit sellers from the online giant, which generally declines to provide information about sellers without a subpoena or other legal action. Other online selling platforms such as eBay Inc. are more willing to cooperate without legal intervention, investigators say. </p><p>   Amazon \"may be the largest unregulated pawnshop on the face of the planet,\" said Sgt. Ian Ranshaw of the Thornton, Colo., police department. \"It is super hard to deal with them.\" </p><p>   Amazon spokesman Alex Haurek said the company doesn't tolerate the selling of stolen goods and works with law enforcement and retailers to stop bad actors, including by withholding funds, closing accounts and making law-enforcement referrals. He said the company spent $700 million last year to combat fraud. Mr. Haurek said Amazon doesn't share customers' and sellers' personal information without a subpoena due to privacy concerns. </p><p>   Organized retail crime has moved onto the Internet, where criminals can move their product quickly and anonymously. Boosters typically sell their goods for about 5% to 10% of retail value to a street-level fence, who then sells them to a larger-scale distributor. </p><p>   Retail investigators blame changes in sentencing laws in some states for an uptick in thefts. In California, a 2014 law downgraded the theft of less than $950 worth of goods to a misdemeanor from a felony. </p><p>   Earlier this year, an e-commerce analyst on Mr. Dugan's team who looks for sellers hawking products such as allergy medicine or razor blades identified an Amazon account with over $1 million in suspicious listings. It was linked to a video store in Leominster, Mass. Local law enforcement, working together with CVS and other retailers, arrested the owner of the video store. Amazon kept the store up for at least six more weeks after the arrest. Amazon's Mr. Haurek said the account was closed \"at the earliest appropriate time after reconciling inventory and completing necessary documentation.\" </p><p>   In late 2017, CVS investigators interviewed three different shoplifters who all said they worked for \"Mr. Bob,\" a man named Robert Whitley, who owned a business in Atlanta. Mr. Dugan shared pictures of the thieves with his counterparts at Target, Publix and Walgreens. They were getting hit by the same people, according to investigators and case documents. </p><p>   The four teams, working with the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service, took two years to unravel the network of shoplifters who had stolen over-the-counter medicines from hundreds of stores in nearly a dozen different states. Mr. Whitley operated an Amazon store, Closeout Express, for about seven years and sold $3.5 million in stolen goods on the platform, according to court documents. In April, Mr. Whitley pleaded guilty to transporting stolen property across state lines; his daughter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to do so. They await sentencing. Amazon said it cooperated with the investigation. </p><p>   Donald Beskin, the Whitleys' lawyer, disputed the characterization of the case, but declined to elaborate. </p><p>   Last year, Home Depot paid for more than $400 in equipment, including a GPS tracker, to help Colorado police follow a member of a crime ring who was transporting stolen power tools to a house in Katy, Texas. </p><p>   The Katy house had been turned into a warehouse, complete with an elevator moving goods between floors, where Steven Skarritt, a former painting contractor, allegedly ran an Amazon storefront that sold almost $5 million in stolen goods between 2018 and 2020, according to a search warrant investigators served Amazon. </p><p>   Mr. Skarritt was charged with first-degree felonies for money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity. Amazon closed his account. </p><p>   In a recent court filing, Mr. Skarritt's attorney, Q. Tate Williams, said there was no direct evidence Mr. Skarritt was aware of the thefts or that any of the stolen merchandise from Colorado was part of his inventory. \"He denies and intends to vigorously defend these charges,\" Mr. Williams said. </p><p>   Retailers have pressed Congress to pass legislation requiring e-commerce sites to verify details for third-party sellers and make certain information public, making it harder for people to sell stolen goods. </p><p>   Amazon, along with other online marketplaces including eBay, has lobbied against the bill, saying such measures would invade sellers' privacy. Mr. Haurek said the legislation would favor large retailers at the expense of small businesses that sell online. </p><p>   \"We believe the most effective way to stop fraud and abuse is for Congress and the states to increase penalties and provide law enforcement with greater resources,\" he said. </p><p>   Last year, Amazon began conducting interviews to verify seller identities, and now does so for the \"vast majority\" of prospective sellers, Mr. Haurek said. The company also requires prospective sellers to provide government-issued identification, addresses, credit cards, bank accounts and taxpayer information. It also makes public some seller information. The verification last year stopped more than six million attempts by apparent bad actors to create seller accounts, he said. </p><p>   In last autumn's San Francisco case, CVS investigators for weeks tracked a ring of nearly two dozen boosters targeting who were stealing up to $39,000 a day in merchandise. </p><p>   They followed the stolen goods to two units in a warehouse facility in Concord, Calif. When investigators ran the address through a database, one business stood out: D-Luxe. </p><p>   The company was owned by a man named Danny Drago -- known as \"Daniel the Medicine Man\" for the types of products he bought -- and his wife, Michelle Fowler. A company website  said it did business with Amazon's \"Top Rated Sellers.\" </p><p>   On Sept. 10, CVS's Mr. Dugan asked Amazon for more details on its relationship with D-Luxe. Amazon refused, saying it would respond only to a subpoena from law enforcement. </p><p>   When the San Mateo sheriff's department served a search warrant to banks associated with Mr. Drago and Ms. Fowler on Sept. 28, investigators realized the Drago enterprise was bigger than they had thought, according to people close to the investigation. The district attorney's office, through a court order, froze the accounts. </p><p>   Investigators believed Mr. Drago and Ms. Fowler were involved in a nearly $30 million operation, the people close to the investigation said. Between 2017 and 2019, they operated at least two Amazon storefronts, the people said. They also sold to at least three other sellers on Amazon, one of the people said. CVS estimates the operation was selling $5 million a year in stolen goods on Amazon or to other Amazon sellers in recent years. Amazon suspended at least one of the accounts in 2019 and both are now closed. \"The account was blocked after we suspected the seller could be listing improperly obtained product, and the seller couldn't produce valid invoices,\" Amazon's Mr. Haurek said. </p><p>   He said the company worked with law enforcement to help break up an additional ring Mr. Drago had supplied, including closing four seller accounts. When Amazon suspects a seller may be hawking goods it purchased from a retail crime ring, it requests invoices, purchase orders or other proofs of sourcing, he added. </p><p></p>",
