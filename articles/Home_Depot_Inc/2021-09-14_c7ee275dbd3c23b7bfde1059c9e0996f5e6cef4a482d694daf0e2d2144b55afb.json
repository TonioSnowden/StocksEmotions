  "title": "VC Daily: How Tia Uses Telehealth to Prep Bricks-and-Mortar Expansion",
  "text": "<p>Before opening a new clinic in Los Angeles this year, for example, Tia signed up hundreds of customers locally for its telehealth services. About 70% of its L.A. members have had a virtual visit by the time the clinic opened, Ms. Witte says. That allowed Tia to generate demand and revenue while collecting building permits and coping with the rest of the slog that opening a new health facility requires.</p><p>\"Brick and mortar is slow. It's expensive, and it's slow,\" Ms. Witte says, adding the process of getting a clinic off the ground can take nine to 12 months. \"It's a huge barrier to growth,\" she adds.</p><p>Yet, Tia needs to operate such locations because they are key to the care it provides—the company offers primary care, gynecology, acupuncture and mental health services. \"You can't get your blood drawn on the Internet, you can't get an [intrauterine device] on the internet,\" Ms. Witte says.</p><p>Today, Tia has clinics in New York and L.A. Its Phoenix-area clinic is due to open in November. Meantime, local customers can sign up for virtual care. It also plans to launch telehealth for San Francisco customers this year, ahead of opening a clinic in the city in 2022.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Healthcare venture fund.
