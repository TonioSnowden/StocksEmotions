  "title": "Walmart Sales Rise as Retail Giant Gains Shoppers With Inflation Pounding Budgets; Nation's largest retailer by revenue raises sales outlook though it says consumers bought fewer higher-margin items",
  "text": "<p>Walmart's stock rose nearly 7% in premarket trading to $148, as the company raised its sales outlook and said earnings on an adjusted basis would decline by a smaller margin than it previously expected.</p><p>Though sales rose at a faster pace than it previously forecast, Walmart said big shifts in consumer spending begun earlier this year continued to dampen profits and forced it to discount some general-merchandise goods to clear shelves.</p><p>Inventory levels remain high compared with last year when retailers scrambled to stock shelves as demand surged and supply-chain snarls held back the supply of products. In the most recent quarter the value of inventories rose 12% from a year earlier, boosted by inflation, the company said. That represented a slowdown from the previous quarter.</p><p>As spending habits change and some costs increase, large retailers have been canceling orders with suppliers, resisting price increases for products and, in some cases, asking them to provide discounts to help remedy the situation.</p><p>Lower sales of generally higher-margin categories such as electronics, home and apparel, ate into profits for Walmart. The retailer raised prices during the quarter to offset some higher costs, it said. Inflation eased last month but remained high, offering a sign that the price increases of the past year may be cooling.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Walmart?

Traffic fell 4.3%.</p><p>Walmart recorded a more than $3 billion charge in the latest quarter in connection with a settlement of opioid-related lawsuits brought by several U.S. states and municipalities, a move that comes weeks after pharmacy chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. reached similar settlements.</p><p>The settlement helped push Walmart to a quarterly loss of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.11 billion a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as the opioid settlement, the company's earnings per share were $1.50, coming in in ahead of analysts' expectations.</p><p>The company also unveiled a new $20 billion share buyback authorization, after ending the third quarter with about $1.9 billion left under its previous program.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Sales Rise as Retail Giant Gains Shoppers With Inflation Pounding Budgets</p>",
