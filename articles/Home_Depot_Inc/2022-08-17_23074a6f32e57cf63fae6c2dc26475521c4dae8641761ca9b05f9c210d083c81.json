Following better-than-expected results on Tuesday from Walmart WMT and Home Depot HD, it was the turn of retailing peers Target TGT and Lowe's LOW to deliver earnings. Target's numbers disappointed, after higher markdowns led to lower margins, but Lowe's figures were well-received.</p><p>\"In the wake of Walmart and Home Depot, I think Wall Street had much higher expectations for Target,\" Navellier said in an interview.</p><p>\"We believe kind of a rally in technology was hopeful, kind of Fed pivot and that we're near the end of interest rate tightening cycle,\" said Andy Tepper, managing director at BNY Mellon Wealth Management on Wednesday. \"And quite frankly, we think that may be a little bit premature, that there still is some worrisome stickier inflation that the Federal Reserve needs to deal with.\"</p><p>In economic data, U.S. retail sales were unchanged overall in July, though largely due to falling gasoline prices and fewer purchases of new cars and trucks. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal forecasted a 0.1% growth.</p><p>Retail sales minus autos rose 0.4% in July, while retail sales excluding autos and gas climbed 0.7% in July.</p><p>\"We got another data point this morning confirming what we already know; the U.S. economy is not currently in recession,\" Cliff Hodge, Chief Investment Officer, Cornerstone Wealth, in Charlotte NC, wrote. \"Consumers remain resilient in the face of sticky inflation. The beat on the Retail Sales Control Group is a harbinger for economic reacceleration in the third quarter as it flows directly into GDP, but in an environment where good economic news is bad news for markets the argument for a new bull market is further diminished.\"</p><p>See: Stock-market rally faces key challenge at S&amp;P 500's 200-day moving average</p><p>* Shares of Target Corp. TGT slumped 2% Wednesday, after the discount retailer reported fiscal second-quarter profit that fell well short of expectations, as higher markdown rates led to lower gross margins, but revenue that topped forecasts.</p><p>* Shares of TJX Companies TJX gained 4% Wednesday, after the off-price apparel and home fashions retailer reported fiscal second-quarter profitthat rose above expectations, while same-store sales fell more than forecast as \"historically high inflation\" hurt consumer spending, particularly for home goods.</p><p>* Shares of Blue Water Vaccines Inc.
