  "text": "<p>There is something intrinsically comic, or at least mildly pathetic, about a man in a raincoat. To be rained on is to be one of life's victims, caught in the wrong place in the wrong time. No matter how we prepare, the wet finds its way in — a trickle down the back of the neck, sopping wet trouser cuffs, something. We are mocked. </p> <p>So we might ask, in this season of April showers, whether it is ever possible to look good in the rain. </p> <p>Start with the standard British solution: a Barbour, or Barbour-style, waxed jacket. A thoroughly practical garment. My problem is that they are part of a constellation of things, from Land Rovers to elbow patches to wide-wale corduroys, that speak to a vision of genteel English country life, or its anglophiliac American offshoots, that I find thoroughly creepy. I want a place on the coast of Devon as much as the next guy. I will confess to finding grouse delicious. It's just that I suspect elbow patches of being the last vestiges of feudalism. Time to move on.</p> <p>Next option: the good old yellow slicker. It has a nice minimal design and bright yellow is a great colour. You can buy a fine one that will last you forever, from Carhartt or Herschel, for about 70 bucks. Not the least bit breathable, though, so get ready to sweat. Another point is that the yellow slicker was my go-to garment when I was seven or so, and I still find them slightly infantilising and goofy. For better or worse, you can't take yourself seriously in a yellow rubber coat.</p> <p>So if it's serious you want, it's off to Burberry for a classic trenchcoat. Here, we suffer from what we might dub the Humphrey Bogart problem. When a piece of clothing makes you feel like a movie star, you are unknowingly taking the lead role in a satire. You think <em>Maltese Falcon</em>; you get Mr Bean. </p> <p>And all those extraneous flaps, buckles and buttons — what are they for, exactly? You'll do much better in one of Burberry's car coats, which are basically a minimalist version of the same thing. The issue you run into here (at least if you grew up in the 1970s) is the hard-to-shake association of longish raincoats with clammy varieties of sexual perversion. And not only does one confront the possibility of being mistaken for a flasher. You go broke in the process. A Burberry car coat will run you $1,500. Better to pop over to Uniqlo and get a perfectly nice nylon version for $170, and save the rest for bail.</p> <p>Turn now to keeping feet dry. Many brands of Wellingtons do suffer from some of the same “To-the-Manor-Born” problem as the Barbour jacket, but are so fit for purpose that one wants to forgive them. One solution to this problem is skipping the Hunters and buying your rubber boots straight from the hardware store: Home Depot will sell you a nice pair for $20. But you will look a little less than sharp trumping into work in them. </p> <p>(It is an interesting point that in New York City, when the streets get wet, women instantly appear in rain boots, while most men slop through the puddles with the same shoes as always. For my part, I'm terrified of ruining my Crockett &amp; Joneses. Am I the last American man who cares about his shoes?) </p> <p>The problem of the water-resistant-but-smart shoe has not, to my knowledge, ever been solved. Why, then, have I never invested in a pair of galoshes? I suppose because they are an emblem of middle-aged, middle-management pathos, like a tuna sandwich lunch served out of a paper bag. Don't forget your galoshes, Harold! Well, maybe it's time for a reconsideration. Swims, of Norway, seems to have managed this. I'm ordering a pair in a Hermès-ish orange.</p> <p>And protecting your head? Here, I can gloat, is one of the few areas where baldness is a real advantage. My smooth head likes a little moisture. What of my unfortunate friends with hair? Hats are risky. Anything with a brim risks the wearer looking like an off-brand Crocodile Dundee. </p> <p>But I can endorse the bucket hat, if for no other reason than its association with Bill Murray's groundskeeper in <em>Caddyshack</em>, who preferred a camo-patterned model. Stylistically, Murray is always close to true north: goofy perhaps, but a kind of goofy we can live with.</p> <p><em>Email Robert at </em><a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\"><em>robert.armstrong@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong 2021 'Showerproofed — how to look slick in the rain' FT.com 6 April.
