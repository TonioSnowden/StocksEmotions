  "text": "<p>Home Depot's comparable sales rose 31% in the quarter ended May 2 compared with a year earlier -- its highest growth rate since the pandemic began. It was an easier year-over-year comparison for the retailer because sales growth was muted in the 2020 period when Covid-19 put more of a damper on its urban-weighted store footprint. Lowe's comparable sales rose 26% in its quarter ended April 30, which was a slight slowdown compared with the prior quarter's 28%. Both retailers beat Wall Street expectations on their top and bottom lines, with their net incomes surging 85% and 74%, respectively.</p><p>The results seem to dispel some bearish theories around consumer behavior. One fear was that rampant inflation in raw materials would motivate consumers to postpone or cancel projects. A sheet of lumber product priced at $9.55 at Home Depot roughly a year ago had quadrupled in price to $39.76, it noted in its Tuesday earnings call. Still, lumber was among the top-performing categories for both retailers last quarter.</p><p>Another concern was that strong demand from do-it-yourselfers would wane because much of it was driven by fleeting pandemic habits. That doesn't seem to have been the case so far, though both retailers reported even stronger demand from professional customers.</p><p>Both companies' share prices fell after the blowout results, just as they have for the past few quarters despite consistently topping expectations. Investors can't seem to shake the concern that the music might stop abruptly as consumers shift their spending away from home.</p><p>Yet signs point to lasting structural demand for home renovation and repairs. One encouraging sign is that sales growth has been consistent across different regions, whether they had high vaccination rates or not. Lowe's Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said on a Wednesday earnings call that the sales performance was \"more consistently broad-based\" across markets than any other time in his career.</p><p>Outside indicators paint a bullish picture, too. Higher home prices today are supported by a real supply-demand imbalance, which implies lasting strength in prices. That can be a catalyst for continued spending: Existing homeowners are likely to feel that the investments are worth it, while sellers could look to renovate and flip homes with a higher sticker price. An April 15 forecast from the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University showed spending on renovation and repairs is expected to increase at rates higher than year-ago levels through the end of 2021.</p><p>After reaching their respective historic highs earlier in May, Home Depot and Lowe's have given back some gains. Home Depot now trades at 22 times forward 12-month earnings, while Lowe's fetches 18 times. Both are only slightly higher than their respective five-year averages.</p><p>Home prices look ridiculous. By comparison, home-improvement retailers seem affordable.</p>",
