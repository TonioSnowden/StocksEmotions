  "text": "<p>    Walmart Inc. logged another quarter of rising U.S. sales as a return to in-store shopping offset slower online growth, when retailers are navigating rising costs, supply chain snarls and an uptick in Covid-19 cases in many parts of the country. </p><p>   Comparable sales, those from U.S. stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 5.2% in the quarter ended July 30 compared with the same period last year. U.S. e-commerce sales rose 6% from a year ago, when Covid restrictions kept many people home. </p><p>   Growth slowed from earlier in the year, both online and off, but was still given a boost by government stimulus dollars and a generally strong U.S. economy, the company said Tuesday. Sales increased each month through the quarter, with July the strongest month, Walmart said. </p><p>   The recent rise of the Delta variant hasn't left \"any meaningful impact\" nationally on the business, said Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs, in an interview. In some regions shoppers are wearing masks more often in stores, but overall stores remain busy with back-to-school shopping, he said. As some local officials use vaccination requirements, not lockdowns, to fight the pandemic, \"we haven't seen any panic buying or anything like that,\" said Mr. Biggs. </p><p>   There are signs some of the surge in sales at many retailers earlier in the year are cooling. U.S. retail sales fell 1.1% in July, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, with spending declining broadly across categories including clothing, furniture and autos. The government's tally, which includes restaurants and bars, had risen in June as more Americans got vaccinated and spending shifted to dining out and travel. </p><p>   Also on Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said sales rose more slowly than earlier in the pandemic when the company benefited from a rapid surge in home-improvement spending. </p><p>   At Walmart, the latest quarterly sales and profit exceeded Wall Street's estimates. For its fiscal year, Walmart forecast continued sales gains for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. U.S. comparable sales will rise 5% to 6% for the year, Walmart said. </p><p>   More shoppers came to Walmart stores, with U.S. transactions up 6.1% during the quarter, but they spent slightly less per visit, or around 0.8% less versus the same period last year. That is a flip from earlier pandemic trends when shoppers moved spending online and visited stores less frequently but spent more each visit. </p><p>   Executives said the company captured market share from smaller players in the grocery business after losing some share earlier in the pandemic. Grocery sales account for a majority of Walmart's U.S. business. </p><p>   U.S. online sales growth of 6% in the July quarter came after a 97% surge in the year earlier quarter when Covid-19 restrictions prompted people to start ordering groceries and other items from home. Walmart's online sales rose 37% in the first quarter of this year, which ended in May. On Tuesday, the company said it was on track for $75 billion in e-commerce sales for the year. </p><p>   Rival Amazon.com Inc. also reported a slowdown in e-commerce growth in its latest quarter, which ended in June. Amazon's online store sales, which had been growing at a high double-digit rate, eased to 16% year-over-year growth for the June quarter. The decline came even as Amazon moved up the date of its annual Prime Day shopping event, which is usually held in the third quarter. </p><p>   Overall, Walmart reported fiscal second-quarter revenue rose 2.4% to $141 billion, as divestitures of stores in some international markets depressed total revenue. The company had net income of $4.28 billion, down 34% from a year ago when it booked a gain on investment. Excluding such items, Walmart said it had an adjusted profit of $1.78 a share, beating analysts expectations of $1.57 a share, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Executives said the company's U.S. profit got a lift from administering Covid-19 vaccines and lower Covid-related spending, though those gains were muted by higher supply-chain costs and wage increases. </p><p>   Walmart, the country's largest private employer, with around 1.6 million U.S. workers, is navigating a tight labor market, along with a variety of businesses from restaurants to factories. In recent months Walmart has given special bonuses and temporary pay raises to many of its warehouse workers to keep them on the job ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. </p><p>   The retailer is dealing with \"a bit more cost inflation than normal,\" Mr. Biggs said on a conference call Tuesday. \"Our merchants are working with suppliers and monitoring price gaps to keep prices low while managing margins,\" he said. It is also working to navigate supply chain challenges by \"adding extra lead time to orders and chartering vessels specifically for Walmart goods,\" he said. Still, some items continue to be hard to find on shelves, he said. </p><p>   Walmart is asking shoppers to wear masks in counties with high levels of Covid transmission and requiring all staff to wear masks. It is mandating that corporate staff and regional managers get vaccinated but hasn't put a mandate in place for store or warehouse workers. Instead, it is offering a $150 bonus for hourly workers who get the Covid vaccine. </p><p>   \"We think it's important that as many people in the U.S. get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Tuesday while discussing earnings. </p><p>   Walmart's stock has risen more slowly than the overall market, up 4.5% year-to-date compared with 18% for the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   On Tuesday, the shares were flat at $150.70, not far from their all-time highs. </p><p></p>",
