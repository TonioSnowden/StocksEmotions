  "text": "<p>The company cited Mr. Villagomez's record of boosting revenue for a consumer-facing business as one reason for his hire. He begins his tenure as CEO next week.</p><p>Progress is in the midst of growing its already large portfolio of rental houses, which it said now numbers more than 80,000, making the company one of the largest rental-home managers in the country. Its recent acquisitions include the purchase of more than 3,000 homes from Zillow Offers, Zillow Group Inc.'s nowclosed house-flipping unit.</p><p>Born in Mexico City and trained as a chemical engineer, Mr. Villagomez worked for DuPont and McKinsey &amp; Co. before moving to Home Depot in 2014. He most recently served as the president of Homedepot.com and as the company's chief marketing officer for U.S. retail.</p><p>Though he hasn't previously worked for a large real-estate company, Mr. Villagomez worked with construction clients at McKinsey and with contractors and large property companies at Home Depot, he said.</p><p>One of his top goals for the new post is improving tenant experiences, Mr. Villagomez said.</p><p>\"Other industries have gone through this transformation of delivering a personalized experience that customers love. I think it's time for the single family-rental business to accelerate that and provide this to our residents,\" he said.</p><p>During the pandemic the single-family rental industry has been flush with investment capital and investor buyers now account for the greatest share of U.S. home sales that they ever have, according to real-estate company Redfin. Some investors, including Pretium, are also putting large sums into the construction of new single-family homes that are rented instead of sold.</p><p>Write to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com</p><p>Home Depot Executive Adolfo Villagomez to Be New CEO of Progress Residential</p>",
