  "title": "Why Balenciaga's $1,790 Garbage Bag Is Already a Success; Prop comedy has come for fashion's luxury houses: From pigeon clutch bags to paint-can totes, designer sight gags are everywhere—and they may have an ulterior motive",
  "text": "<p>I'm ambivalent about pigeons. Here in New York City, they're as ubiquitous as parking tickets. They leave me to peck at my phone just as I leave them to peck at stepped-on pizza crust.</p><p>I'm certainly not about to carry one around. Others apparently feel differently: Behold the $890, 3D-printed resin \"Pigeon Clutch\" handbag from British fashion brand JW Anderson.</p><p>It has webbed brown toes, beady amber eyes and Oreo-tinted striations running down its \"wings\" and firm molded form. (One wing swings up to reveal a compartment.) It looks, well, like a pigeon. Plop it on Madison Avenue and flustered tourists may shoo it away.</p><p>The first release of the pigeon bag sold out, according to a representative for JW Anderson, and a second run, which will ship in November, is available for preorder. It was the most-viewed product on the brand's website in August, the representative said. On social media, scads of people are crowing about it. \"Horrified of pigeons but I'd die for this JW Anderson clutch,\" reads one tweet. \"JW Anderson is an absolute meme lord for making a £650 pigeon clutch,\" offers another.</p><p>This pigeon is part of a recent flock of unisex or men-targeted luxury handbags destined to stir up tweets and online takes. Louis Vuitton offers a $2,850 men's leather \"Paint Can\" bag that is shaped like a tub of Sherwin Williams primer. It comes in just six colors—a sprawling Home Depot paint department this is not. As one Twitter pundit wondered: \"Since when carrying a paint can is considered fashion?\"</p><p>Then there is Balenciaga's $1,790 \"Trash Pouch,\" the spitting image of a half-stuffed Hefty bag, which according to the brand won't be available for weeks, but has generated press everywhere from Fox Business to the home-décor blog Apartment Therapy. Reactions often note that for the same price as one saggy leather clutch, you can purchase about 6,500 genuine Heftys.</p><p>Such items are \"clearly designed to be shared,\" said Ana Andjelic, a brand executive and author of \"The Business of Aspiration.\" \"People talk about them, they grab people's attention. So, in that sense, it's the best brand advertising possible.\"</p><p>Will people buy these bags? Certainly. But online chatter and eyeballs, like the over 200,000 views of a woman's TikTok who bought Anderson's winged clutch (she named it \"Perry the Pigeon\"), are another measure of success. \"It's so hard to actually get the attention of the consumer today, even on social media,\" said Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the Fashion &amp; Luxury M.B.A. program at New York University. \"Sometimes you need that strong of a product to regain the attention that has gone elsewhere.\"</p><p>Today, as luxury companies release bags with the frequency of bird droppings, it seems the more comical, the more shareable, the more downright foolish the design, the better. To riff on James Carville: \"It's the Instagram likes, stupid!\"</p><p>\"These are conversation pieces,\" said professor Joseph Hancock II, the director of the retail merchandising program at Drexel University and author of \"Fashion Branding Stories.\" Those conversations, he noted, are often online, where the majority of his Gen Z students spend idle hours. \"They all look at Instagram, they all look at TikTok. And so those things are the major vehicles for fashion change.\"</p><p>Since he bought it this summer, Eduardo Granja Bautista's bird purse has animated countless such conversations. \"​​It's my most talked-about bag ever,\" said the 32-year-old content creator in Mexico City. A video he posted to Instagram demonstrating how much his puny bag actually holds (more than you might think) has received over 3,000 likes and 130 comments, including many heart-eyes emojis. \"It is a statement for sure,\" he said.</p><p>Still, said Mr. Hancock, \"most consumers aren't going to buy those bags.\" For brands, they're bait: See enough viral articles about that ersatz pigeon and you might search out JW Anderson for yourself, where you might buy a pair of sneakers or a more practical bag. By going viral, a brand gets a halo of cultural cachet, said Ms. Serdari: \"If you buy something else, you're still very hip and very cool because you're part of that universe.\"</p><p>It's a play Balenciaga has run before: This year it made global headlines by introducing pre-distressed $1,850 sneakers. Even Nike, which has riled up the internet with fuzzy, Muppet-esque Grateful Dead versions of its Dunks, and Crocs, which frequently markets limited-clog curiosities, have demonstrated the trickle-down power of virality.</p><p>Today's bizarro bags could be seen as the unruly grandchildren of the work of Judith Leiber, a Hungarian-born designer who starting in the 1960s made grin-inducing gemstone clutches depicting everything from french fries to a penguin in a top hat. Notably, contemporary Instagram influencers have newly cottoned to the brand's whimsical (and wildly expensive) clutches. Last year, Kylie Jenner posted a nearly $6,000 lion-shaped clutch to Instagram—the gems twinkling through a phone screen.</p><p>As for shoppers, beauty is in the eye of the pigeon-holder. The message is, \"I can have any tasteful thing and I'm choosing the pigeon bag,\" said Ms. Andjelic. She sees absurdist accessories as evidence of a recalibration in the luxury market, in which scarcity, quality and practicality often take a back seat to the shock, or smirk, factor. \"Will it hold my phone\" is suddenly less relevant than will it make my friends go \"Uh, what is that?'\"</p><p>Casey Pham, 30, who works in retail in Los Angeles, preordered Anderson's pigeon bag the moment he saw it. \"It's just silly. I like birds,\" he said. \"I thought it'd be funny to walk around town and people would think that I'm carrying a bird as a purse.\"</p><p>He recently carted his beaked companion to a friend's house where it earned a reception a real pigeon could only dream of: \"They thought it was the best thing ever,\" he said. Online though, Mr. Pham has noticed people \"just think it's obnoxious, which I kind of like,\" said Mr. Pham. After all, if everyone had their own squab accessory, his would become as unremarkable as an actual pigeon.</p><p>MORE IN ON TREND</p><p>* Men Are Fanatical About These Pants.
