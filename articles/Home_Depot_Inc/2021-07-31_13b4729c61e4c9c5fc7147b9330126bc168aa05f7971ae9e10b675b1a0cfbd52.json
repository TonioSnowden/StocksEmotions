  "title": "EXCHANGE --- High Lumber Prices Lift Sawmills",
  "text": "<p>Lumber prices, which had already broken records last summer, spiked during the spring quarter to more than twice their pre-pandemic high. Budgets were busted from apartment complexes down to garden planters. Wood costs threatened the housing boom and became central to the debate over whether runaway inflation was brewing or high prices were temporary and would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.</p><p>Though prices have dropped by more than 60% since May, when futures hit $1,711.20 per thousand board feet, lumber remains nearly as expensive as it ever was before the lockdowns. Futures for September delivery settled Friday at $621.20.</p><p>Like many businesses, sawyers have contended with higher transportation costs, wages and energy bills. Crucially, though, the glut of mill-ready pine trees in the South kept log prices depressed and mill profit margins wide in the continent's most prolific lumber-producing region.</p><p>The average price across the South for pine logs rose 3% during the quarter to $25.41 a ton, which is about what it was a decade ago at the depths of the housing crash, according to TimberMart-South, a pricing service affiliated with the University of Georgia's forestry school.</p><p>Sawmill companies are spending the windfalls to further consolidate and boost output, particularly in the South, where they have flocked for the cheap trees. They are also rewarding shareholders, who have suffered through some bad years since the housing bust, with special dividends and stock buybacks.</p><p>West Fraser Timber reported net income of $1.49 billion for April, May and June, an amount the company has historically needed years to earn. The results were boosted by its first full quarter owning panel-maker Norbord. The February acquisition made North America's largest lumber producer also its biggest manufacturer of oriented strand board, which is used to sheathe roofs, floors and walls and also rose to record prices.</p><p>PotlatchDeltic Corp., which owns timberland in six states and mills in four, said its wood-products division was more profitable in the latest quarter than it was during all of last year, which had been an annual record. Its $187.9 million of net income might have been even better if a fire hadn't knocked out its lumber mill in Ola, Ark., in mid-June.</p><p>Canfor, which operates 10 mills in western Canada and 12 in the U.S. South, followed suit reporting its own record quarter on Thursday. Weyerhaeuser Co., the largest U.S. timberland owner and operator of mills in the U.S. and Canada, on Friday said it had its most profitable quarter ever by 40%, with net income of $1.03 billion.</p><p>Mill executives don't expect a repeat of the spring windfall, but they say wood prices could rise again given the wildfires that have prompted West Fraser and Canfor to curtail output in British Columbia, the potential for rebound in the overheated do-it-yourself market and the strong market for new homes.</p><p>\"We actually fundamentally believe we went too high, and we think we've probably gone a bit too low in the correction,\" West Fraser's senior vice president of marketing and corporate development, Chris McIver, told investors Thursday.</p><p>Orders from retailers like Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. dried up when prices got too high and Americans resumed spending on travel and entertainment. But home-improvement centers have resumed purchasing since prices have declined, said Eric Cremers, PotlatchDeltic's chief executive.</p>",
