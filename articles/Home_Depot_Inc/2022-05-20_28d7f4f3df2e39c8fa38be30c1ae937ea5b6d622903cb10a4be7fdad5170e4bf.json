  "title": "Business News:  Kohl's Trims Its Forecasts  As Shoppers Tighten Belts  ----  By John Stensholt and Dean Seal",
  "text": "<p>   Kohl's Corp. slashed its sales and profit targets amid a sharper-than-expected pullback in consumer spending, but executives said suitors remain interested in buying the department-store chain ahead of a bid deadline. </p><p>   While the first quarter started strong, company officials said, demand weakened as inflation spurred consumers to tighten their belts without the lift from last year's government stimulus to help spending. Overall sales for the quarter fell 5.2% from a year earlier. </p><p>   \"Their wallets are being squeezed and so they're coming into the store and they're being a bit more mindful of the brands they are buying and what is going in their basket,\" Kohl's finance chief Jill Timm told analysts Thursday. </p><p>   The results are the latest warning sign this week on the retail environment, sparking a selloff of shares across the sector. Large retailers, including Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., are increasing their sales at rates far slower than they did during the height of the pandemic, and now profits are falling on higher costs. </p><p>   Shoppers are switching from discretionary purchases to lower-margin items like groceries and other household staples, pressuring company profits. Home-improvement chains Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. are seeing transaction counts fall, but revenue is being supported by higher prices for items across their stores. </p><p>   Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass said the company is confident in its strategies to turn around the business despite the soft first-quarter results. She said the company is \"pleased with the number of parties who recognize the value of our business\" and that it is financially healthy. Kohl's has fielded offers from bidders including the private-equity firm Sycamore Partners and Canada's Hudson's Bay Co., The Wall Street Journal reported. Kohl's shares gained more than 4% in Thursday trading. The stock is down about 9% year to date. </p><p>   The sale process came after Kohl's rejected a $9 billion takeover offer from a group of activist investors in February as being too low and adopted a so-called poison pill to prevent them from buying more than 10% of the company. </p><p>   The earnings report comes days after the company won a proxy battle, as shareholders backed Kohl's slate of directors over an activist's push to replace up to 10 of the 13 board members. </p><p>   Kohl's said it incurred $17 million of expenses related to the proxy contest and sales process. </p><p>   Some executives are leaving the company through the tumult. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Kohl's said its chief merchandising officer, Doug Howe, is departing, and that Chief Marketing Officer Greg Revelle will be stepping down in June. </p><p>   The duo will be replaced on an interim basis by internal vice presidents Ron Murray and Christie Raymond while a wider executive search was conducted, the company said. </p><p>   For the quarter ended April 30, Kohl's reported earnings of $14 million, flat with the prior year. Per-share earnings came in at 11 cents. Analysts expected 69 cents a share, according to FactSet. </p><p>   The company is now expecting no more than 1% growth in net sales for the year, after previously forecasting a rise of between 2% and 3%. It expects annual earnings to be between $6.45 and $6.85 a share, marking a 60 cents per share reduction from the midpoint of its previous guidance. </p><p></p>",
