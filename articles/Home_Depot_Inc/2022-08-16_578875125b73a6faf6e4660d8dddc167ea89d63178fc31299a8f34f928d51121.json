  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA closed 239.57 points, or 0.7%, higher at 34,152.01, above the key 34,000 level for the first time since May 4.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX climbed 8.06 points, or 0.2%, at 4,305.20. The index has now risen 17.5% from its mid-June low.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP was down 25.50 points, or 0.2%, at 13,102.55.</p><p>Stocks rose Monday also, with the Dow rising 151 points, or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.6%. The S&amp;P was up more than 17% through Monday from its mid-June low, but remains down 10.4% from its Jan. 3 record close.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>After getting off to a wobbly start, U.S. stocks swung higher as a rally in retailer stocks helped lift the Dow and S&amp;P 500 to their highest levels in more than three months.</p><p>Strong performances from Walmart WMT and Home Depot Inc. HD helped the Dow lead U.S. stocks higher, with the two retailing giants accounting for more than half of the blue-chip average's gains.</p><p>Wal-Mart gained 5.1% after reporting strong fiscal second-quarter profit and raising its full-year outlook, making it the Dow's best performer, while Home Depot wasn't far behind, rising 4.1% after affirming its full-year outlook and reporting profits, sales and same-store sales that all beat expectations.</p><p>Their strong earnings reports sparked a broader rally in retail stocks that drove the consumer-staples sector up 2.3%, making it the best performer among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors.</p><p>Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, pointed out that Wal-Mart and Home Depot were responsible for more than half of the Dow's gain on Tuesday.</p><p>\"Any sign that the consumer is still strong is a good thing,\" Saluzzi added during a phone interview with MarketWatch. \"The market is shaking off a lot of the recessionary concerns and saying 'well maybe inflation has peaked. Maybe the economy has achieved the soft landing that people were hoping for.'\"</p><p>Read: This stock-market milestone indicates the S&amp;P 500 could be as much as 16% higher one year from today</p><p>Some market watchers, however, cautioned that the market could be getting ahead of itself.</p><p>\"We would caution investors against chasing this rally. We expect renewed market volatility ahead, and we continue to recommend positioning portfolios for resilience under various scenarios,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>\"With inflation still high, we favor value stocks including global energy. And with the economic outlook uncertain, we think investors can consider defensive equity exposure via global healthcare or quality income stocks,\" he wrote.</p><p>Other retailers that rallied on Tuesday included Target Corp. TGT Lowe's Cos. LOW and Kohl's Corp. KSS â€” all three of which will report earnings later this week. Their shares were up 4.6%, 2.9%, and 6.1%, respectively, while, Best Buy Co. Inc.

BBBY which closed 29% higher after a wild session, while Overstock.com Inc. OSTK gained 11.8%.</p><p>While investors on Reddit forums like Wall Street Bets cheered the rally in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson has advised investors that they should dump the stock, arguing that the move has led to \"unrealistic\" valuations.</p><p>Economic data released Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts fell 9.6% in July, while building permits were down1.3%.</p><p>In addition, U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in July, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
