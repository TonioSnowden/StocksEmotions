  "title": "Unruly Times  Spark Ruckus  Of Gaveling  ---  Vexed officials  resort to bashing  to restore order  ----  By Jacob Gershman",
  "text": "<p>   There is no Guinness World Record for the most banging of a gavel by a local government official. But a Hinds County board of supervisors meeting last year in Mississippi was surely one for the history books. </p><p>   The gathering began civilly enough with an invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance. Then, in protest of an agenda item, County Supervisor David Archie raised a makeshift gavel he bought at Home Depot and proceeded to pound it hundreds of times. A local newspaper called it a \"gavel-pounding rampage.\" </p><p>    Mr. Archie defended his gaveling spree, saying it was the only way to deal with a fellow supervisor in their dispute over who was the board's rightful president. \"Saying you're out of order and hitting the gavel at the same time, he knows I mean business,\" said Mr. Archie. </p><p>   Months later, Mr. Archie's performance still rings in the ears of locals, who kid him about it. \"At dinners and different functions, I've had judges ask me to use the gavel to get their courtrooms in order,\" he said. </p><p>   The wooden gavel may be best known as a symbol of the legal profession and a prop for reality show judges. But in these unruly times, the gavel has become an emblem of civic disorder. Footage from local government meetings shows vexed city, county and school board officials bashing their gavels to enforce silence, parliamentary procedure and civil debate. </p><p>   Officials wielding the gavel call it a primitive but useful tool to gain control of the room when Robert's Rules fly out the window. Those on the receiving end bristle at all the banging. </p><p>   \"Put your gavel down,\" said Brad Peck, a commissioner in Washington state's Franklin County, to the commission's gavel-swinging chairman during an April meeting. </p><p>   The chairman, former National Football League tight end Clint Didier, had lost his patience with Mr. Peck, who had interrupted the county auditor. The auditor, for his part, was alleging a political conspiracy behind a $5,600 bill he got for accidentally backing his car into a coroner's utility truck. </p><p>   \"Order! Order!\" commanded Mr. Didier, rapping his gavel in triplets. </p><p>   \"You love that thing, don't you? Makes you feel important,\" said Mr. Peck, a retired Air Force officer. </p><p>   Mr. Peck, in an interview, said the gavel is no substitute for order. \"The gavel is a surrogate for people who, frankly, crave control and power over others,\" he said. </p><p>   In Trumbull County, Ohio, no amount of gaveling has been able to get the meetings of the board of commissioners back on track. </p><p>   \"Stop with the f -- ing gavel,\" said commissioner Niki Frenchko to the board president sitting next to her as he banged away in June. </p><p>   \"That's not the appropriate language to be saying at a public meeting,\" replied Frank Fuda, the board president. </p><p>   \"And that's not the appropriate demeanor to bang your gavel like a psycho,\" Ms. Frenchko snapped back. </p><p>   Weeks earlier at another meeting, an exasperated Mr. Fuda struck his gavel so emphatically it splintered. </p><p>   \"He actually hit it so hard a piece of it flew off,\" said Ms. Frenchko. \"I was like, oh my God, you broke the gavel.\" </p><p>   \"What do you do when a commissioner interrupts every meeting for 18 months?\" Mr. Fuda said in an interview. \"What else do we have but the gavel? What am I going to do, yell at her?\" </p><p>    Sara Clark Pierson, past president of the school board in Grand Ledge, Mich., used to believe meetings could be orderly without banging on things. That was before the last year, she said, when her district, like many around the country, faced a parental revolt that pushed meetings onto the front lines of the national culture war. </p><p>   The school board had around a dozen in-person meetings during her tenure as president, and Ms. Pierson said she had to use her gavel in all of them. One time, she said, a parent brought her own gavel to the meeting and started banging it in protest. </p><p>   That parent had exceeded her allotted three minutes, according to the board. When they tried to interrupt her, she pulled out a mallet-size gavel and pounded the lectern, eliciting applause from other parents. Ms. Pierson gaveled right back until she took her seat. </p><p>   \"I laughed at it when she brought it out,\" said Ms. Pierson. \"It looked so cartoonish.\" </p><p>   In a well-functioning polity, the gavel is a symbol of a community that allows debate and respects difference, said Stephen David Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. \"The gavel is saying, let's listen to each other,\" he said. </p><p>   Tim Wynn, president of Perfect Rules Inc., a parliamentary consulting company based in Florida, said the banging gavel is a symptom of a lack of understanding of the rules governing deliberative assemblies, or a lack of confidence in the process. </p><p>   He cited a line from the bible of parliamentary procedure, Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised 12th edition: \"Under no circumstances should the chair attempt to drown out a disorderly member -- either by his own voice or the gavel.\" </p><p>   \"The gavel is not going to do anything on its own,\" said Mr. Wynn. \"It's just a loud noise.\" </p><p></p>",
