  "text": "<p>   Raymond James analyst Joe Altobello said Scotts could have done a better job of forecasting and that it was slow to respond. While the drop in consumer sales by unit was \"pretty much what we expected coming into this year,\" the fact that retailers weren't reordering \"was the big difference,\" he said. \"They got caught flat-footed.\" </p><p>   Scotts said its forecasts were accurate until a sudden shift in retailer orders in late April and early May. </p><p>   Scotts' decision to produce so much inventory at a time when retailers were overstocked with durable goods may have made it easier for the retailers to reduce their orders, said Andrew Carter, analyst with Stifel, an investment bank. Big-ticket items like grills take longer to sell down, he said, but lawn and garden goods should move faster. </p><p>   If the retailers know that Scotts can quickly resupply them, it makes sense to carry fewer weeks of that inventory. \"They put themselves in a position where they were a pretty easy target,\" Mr. Carter said. </p><p>   Scotts promotes three-day delivery as part of its sales pitch to big retailers. </p><p>   Last month, Walmart, Target and Home Depot reported their collective second-quarter inventory jumped $20 billion from a year ago, meaning the stores are still working to sell their current stock. </p><p>   Home Depot and Lowes Cos., which together accounted for about 40% of Scotts' fiscal 2021 sales, also said last month that the weather in many parts of the country reduced demand for products like fertilizer, which had been one of the biggest sales categories in the previous two years. </p><p>   In late August, Scotts said full-year cash flow would be negative $275 million to $325 million, compared with a projection of negative $150 million in early August. The company also disclosed that its finance chief, Cory Miller, had left the company. Board member David Evans took the interim role as it seeks external candidates for a replacement. </p><p>   Mr. Hagedorn wants the company to get back to its roots. </p><p>   On this office wall there is a framed 1996 article from The Wall Street Journal about the family's takeover and their \"remolding Scotts to reflect their own thrifty, entrepreneurial ways.\" He said his current mission to cut costs and keep the company leaner in terms of inventory and debt is to return to those ways. </p><p></p>",
