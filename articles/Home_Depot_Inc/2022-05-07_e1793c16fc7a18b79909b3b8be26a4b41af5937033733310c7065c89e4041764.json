He helped launch Doritos Locos Tacos, a hit that sold hundreds of millions of crispy folded shells in its first year.</p><p>\"I realized there's really a difference between liking something and loving something, or just buying something versus buying into it,\" Mr. Niccol said about his Taco Bell work.</p><p>In 2018, Mr. Niccol became one of Chipotle's first outside chief executives, succeeding founder Steve Ells. Mr. Niccol, now 48 years old, moved Chipotle's headquarters to Southern California from Denver in an attempt to give the brand a fresh start. He beefed up food-safety procedures and was early to offer delivery through companies like DoorDash Inc. He dreamed of building online ordering tools at Chipotle that could rival those at Starbucks Corp. and Domino's Pizza Inc.</p><p>That came in handy when the pandemic hit, closing many of Chipotle's dining rooms. Online sales accounted for nearly half of orders last year. Nr. Niccol sped up plans to build online-pickup drive-throughs and increased menu prices on delivery to help cover the costs.</p><p>Chipotle's sales hit a record in 2021, and the company's shares are trading at almost five times the price when Mr. Niccol started the job. He hopes to reach a total of 7,000 stores in North America, up from 3,000 today.</p><p>\"Have we had a perfect path to getting here? No,\" Mr. Niccol said. \"Are we committed to doing the right things? Absolutely.\"</p><p>Here are four of his trusted advisers:</p><p>Craig Cappozzo</p><p>CEO, Thriving Brands Co.</p><p>Mr. Niccol got a summer internship working at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. under Mr. Cappozzo in 1995, then landed his first job working on brands inclduing Scope mouthwash with the executive the following year. Mr. Cappozzo helped Mr. Niccol learn the P&amp;G principle of distilling an idea down to key points that can fit on a one-page memo, not just stringing along ideas in a PowerPoint presentation, he said.</p><p>\"It takes some practice, it takes some discipline, it takes some focus, and that's really helped me over time,\" Mr. Niccol said.</p><p>He also credits his former boss with helping him become a professional.</p><p>\"He helped me transition from being a college kid to an executive,\" Mr. Niccol said.</p><p>Scott Bergren</p><p>Former Yum Brands Inc. executive</p><p>Mr. Bergren, then the president and CEO of Pizza Hut, promoted Mr. Niccol to become the chain's marketing chief in 2007. Mr. Bergen helped him think creatively in ways Mr. Niccol said he hadn't previously explored. The two men pushed Pizza Hut into online ordering and helped develop one of the first pizza-chain ordering apps for iPhone, an achievement that still excites Mr. Niccol. He often calls his old mentor to talk, and often leaves the conversation surprised by new insights that hadn't occurred to him, Mr. Niccol said.</p><p>Jamie Egasti</p><p>Former Procter &amp; Gamble Co. executive</p><p>Mr. Egasti, the general manager of snacks at P&amp;G who oversaw the Pringles account in 2000, was Mr. Niccol's boss at the time. Mr. Egasti was dreaming up exclusive chip flavors for retailers to try to increase sales. Mr. Egasti taught Mr. Niccol to focus on one specific product and what customers wanted from it, and to block out other distractions. His advice: \"You can't skip what your customers are telling you they need.\"</p><p>David Novak</p><p>Former Yum Brands Inc. CEO and chairman</p><p>Mr. Niccol rose through the Yum ranks during Mr. Novak's tenure, and became head of Taco Bell in 2015. Mr. Novak freely offered both praise and criticism, Mr. Niccol recalled. The two would work on specific points of personal improvement for the year. \"He was always a huge champion of making me better,\" Mr. Niccol said. Mr. Novak also introduced Mr. Niccol to others who remain influential advisers in his life, including Home Depot Inc. co-founder Ken Langone and CVS Health Corp. Chairman David Dorman, he said.</p><p>Bio bits</p><p>* Age: 48</p><p>* Education: Undergraduate degree from Miami University; M.B.A. from University of Chicago Booth School of Business</p><p>* First job: Lawn-mowing business as a teenager</p><p>* Recent favorite books: 'The Code Breaker'; 'Every Shot Counts'</p><p>* Hobbies: Golf and photography</p><p>* Management mantra: 'Once you know what makes your brand/company magical, you have to hold everyone accountable and ensure you have leaders who represent that.'</p><p>* Fun fact: I can still do a back flip on the trampoline and diving board</p><p>* Stress reliever: Spending time with family; golf</p><p>* Superpower: Grilling on the Big Green Egg.</p><p>* Time alarm clock goes off on weekdays: 6 a.m.</p><p>* Grew up: Suburbs of Philadelphia, Dallas</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>Chipotle Mexican Grill Chief Thrives on Turnarounds</p>",
