  "text": "<p>   She also accelerated $750 million of spending to speed up the network by October so that shippers could take advantage of the improvements in time for the holiday season. </p><p>   In October, with shipping volumes picking up as retailers shifted sales events like Amazon's Prime Day earlier on the calendar, Ms. Tome and her senior leaders convened a \"premortem\" on the peak season, with each executive coming up with their own definition of what success would look like. </p><p>   \"This should just be the way we run peak going forward,\" she said. </p><p>   The founder of an online business-to-business distributor who just a year earlier moved more of its shipping budget to UPS received notice during the holiday season that the carrier was terminating its three-year contract in 30 days unless it renewed at 30% higher rates. </p><p>   \"They said the leadership change is the reason for their shift,\" said the customer, who has since moved business to FedEx on terms similar to those it previously had with UPS. </p><p>   While not addressing specific customers, Ms. Tome said the current environment, with too much demand for limited capacity, means UPS needs to be paid adequately for its services. </p><p>   \"If the customer isn't willing to pay and they elect to leave us, then we wish them all the best,\" she said. </p><p>   The pricing shift highlights two new realities at UPS. Package volume, which the company for years chased to fill its network, was no longer paramount. Instead, UPS could pick better, more profitable deliveries -- like heavier packages that cost more to ship or shipments that tend to include multiple packages per stop -- and turn away some accounts with lower margins, according to analysts. </p><p>   At the same time, Ms. Tome is taking more of a retailer's approach to UPS's 1.9 million customers, viewing them as a portfolio that needs \"segmentation.\" That means some larger customers who may not require as many services, such as warehousing, don't provide huge profit margins but do tender a steady flow of package volume to keep the network full. On the other side, UPS is focused on courting small and medium-size businesses, which tend to need a wider spectrum of services that UPS offers, to boost profits. </p><p>   \"Home Depot didn't make much money on lumber. They made more money on the attachments that they sold on lumber,\" Ms. Tome said. \"As we look at our customer mix, we run it like a portfolio, much like retail.\" </p><p>   At UPS, Amazon is providing most of the lumber. The e-commerce giant paid UPS $11.3 billion last year for shipping services, making up 13.3% of its $84.6 billion total revenue for the year. That was up from 11.6% of all revenue in 2019. </p><p>   Tied to her focus on \"better\" customers is more scrutiny on costs. Early in her stint, Ms. Tome passed on a chance to add to the company's aircraft fleet since it would have forced UPS to find cargo to fill the new jets. She acknowledged that UPS in the past may have taken up the purchase in an arms race for capacity. </p><p>   Likewise, she is also focusing on using all of UPS's existing sorting capacity instead of investing in new superhubs that would face a similar push to find more packages. </p><p>   \"At Home Depot, it was, 'Build a store and they will come,'\" Ms. Tome said. At UPS, she added, \"we were: 'Build facilities and packages will come.'\" </p><p>   Soon after the holiday crush ended, Ms. Tome struck her first big deal -- one that will shrink her company. She agreed to sell off UPS Freight, a division with about 14,500 workers and hundreds of tractor-trailer trucks crisscrossing North America. </p><p>   The division provides what are known as less-than-truckload services, in which cargo from multiple customers is combined into a single trailer. It is a fragmented and competitive market. UPS Freight brought in about $3 billion in annual revenue but operated at a 2.3% profit margin. </p><p>   The less-than-truckload business \"was like a loss leader\" for UPS, Alain Bedard, CEO of TFI International Inc., told investors after he agreed to acquire UPS Freight. The Canadian company plans to overhaul the fleet and renegotiate prices. </p><p>   Ms. Tome plans to disclose more cost-saving measures to investors during a virtual meeting in June. Those could help soften future price increases, as UPS shares savings with customers. It was something she said Home Depot did. \"I would love to do that here,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
