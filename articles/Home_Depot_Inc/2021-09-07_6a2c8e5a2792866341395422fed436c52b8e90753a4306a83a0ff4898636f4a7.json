  "title": "Retail Set to Overtake Banking in AI Spending; Continuing e-commerce surge among factors driving sector to invest more in the technology",
  "text": "<p>The global retail sector is expected to spend $11.8 billion on AI this year, up from $9.36 billion in 2020, according to a new IDC forecast. Spending in the sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25.5% between now and 2025.</p><p>Banks, which spent $9.43 billion on AI last year, are expected to spend $11.7 billion on the technology this year, according to IDC.</p><p>Retailers are increasing their AI spending to improve the customer experience and boost sales recommendations amid rising e-commerce activity sparked by the pandemic, said Ritu Jyoti, group vice president, artificial intelligence and automation research, with IDC's software market research and advisory practice.</p><p>Home-improvement chain Home Depot is in the early stages of rolling out a machine-learning system to spot products that need to be restocked on store shelves. The system uses computer vision, an AI technology that can analyze camera images to track the stock on the shelves of individual stores. It crunches that information along with past shopper buying patterns around events such as holidays, daily product sales and other data to anticipate when shelves will need to be stocked.</p><p>Fahim Siddiqui, the company's senior vice president of information technology, said the company is seeing sales lift on products where the company has tested the system. He declined to say how much the company is spending on AI but said the technology is becoming a bigger portion of the company's overall IT budget.</p><p>Overall, IDC forecasts global spending on AI will grow from $85.3 billion in 2021 to more than $204 billion in 2025.</p><p>Online marketplace Etsy.com, which is operated by Etsy Inc., recently enhanced its search function. It deployed graph technology, which can identify how items might relate to each other, and machine learning to analyze past search queries and results to better understand what shoppers are looking for. For instance, if a buyer is searching for a \"sports coat,\" the system is now better able to match that to an item he or she may be interested in even if the seller has labeled its product a \"custom-made blazer.\"</p><p>\"We absolutely need to leverage machine learning and data science to drive better search and better recommendations for our buyers so that they can find that item that they want as quickly as possible,\" said Mike Fisher, Etsy's chief technology officer. The company said it doesn't share its AI budget numbers.</p><p>As part of Wayfair's strategic investment in machine learning, the online seller of furniture and home goods focuses heavily on computer vision to match shoppers' searches with items they might be interested in buying, said Fiona Tan, the company's global head of customer and supplier technology.</p><p>Consumers shopping for shoes or tools usually know exactly what they are looking for, she said. At Wayfair, customers may just have a general idea of what they want, she said, such as midcentury American kitchen tables.</p><p>Computer vision can capture design features, materials, styles and other elements. Wayfair, for instance, can feed the system images of midcentury American kitchen tables and it can learn the characteristics, such as their simple design and gentle curves, that would put an item in that category. Computer vision, along with human labeling, enables Wayfair to quickly display the types of items its shoppers want.</p><p>The company declined to say how much it spends on AI technologies, but said it is increasing its investment.</p><p>\"You cannot really operate anymore without having the heavy investment in machine learning,\" Ms. Tan said.</p><p>Write to John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.com</p>",
