  "title": "U.S. Stocks Wobble on Fed Signaling; Major cryptocurrencies stabilize with bitcoin trading around $16,600",
  "text": "<p>Stocks had gained in recent days due to expectations thatU.S. inflation in October coming below economists' estimates could mean the Fed may not have to tighten financial conditions much more. However, some excitement dissipated Monday, after a Fed official said policy makers still had \"a ways to go\" and would like to see more similar data points before easing its foot off the brake.</p><p>\"We should get that one data point is not a trend, we shouldn't get carried away. If the market is expecting a pivot on the back of this, I'm afraid we're going to be disappointed,\" said Arun Sai, a multiasset strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"Now the focus should shift to the real economy and whether it can digest what has already happened\" in terms of interest-rate increases.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 3.875% from 3.828% at last week's close.</p><p>Tesla shares declined 3.4%. Chief Executive Elon Musk said he has too much work to juggle after the Twitter takeover and that he was running Tesla's operations \"with great difficulty.\"</p><p>Major retailers including Walmart and Home Depot are due to report earnings Tuesday.</p><p>Bitcoin trade around $16,600 in morning trading. Ether, the second most-popular cryptocurrency inched up to trade around $1,250.</p><p>\"The immediate storm following the collapse of the huge exchange FTX has subsided,\" said Susannah Streeter, a market analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"This whole debacle also comes with a sense of relief that the deep skepticism among regulators about crypto's stability has ringfenced larger, more established financial institutions from contagion.\"</p><p>Overseas, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 1.7% led by property stocks on reports that Beijing officials signed off on sweeping measuresto support the real-estate sector. Country Garden and Longfor Group soared 46% and 16%, respectively.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 1.1%, weighed down by SoftBank's 13% drop. The investment company posted further losses and disappointed investors by not putting forward an expected share buyback.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Wobble on Fed Signaling</p>",
