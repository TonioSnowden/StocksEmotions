  "text": "<p>Read the Home Depot earnings preview.</p><p>Total sales grew 5.6% to $38.87 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $37.95 billion, to beat expectations for the 12th-straight quarter.</p><p>Overall same-store sales growth of 4.3% topped the FactSet consensus for a 3.1% rise, the fifth-straight beat, and U.S. same-store sales were up 4.5% to beat expectations of 3.0% growth.</p><p>\"We delivered another solid performance in the third quarter, driven by strength in project-related categories across the business,\" said Chief Executive Ted Decker.</p><p>Cost of sales increased more than total sales, rising 5.7% to $23.65 billion, as gross margin contracted to 34.0% from 34.1%. Merchandise inventories of $25.72 billion were down 1.4% from the end of July but up 25.0% from a year ago.</p><p>The stock HD fell 1.4% in premarket trading, making it the only component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA falling ahead of the open.</p><p>The company affirmed its fiscal 2022 EPS guidance of growth in the mid-single digits percentage range and for same-store sales growth of 3.0%. The FactSet EPS consensus of $16.60 implies 6.9% growth, and the consensus for same-store sales is for a 3.1% rise.</p><p>Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem said that while third-quarter results were \"solid across the board,\" the affirmed full-year outlook implies growth deceleration in the current fourth quarter.</p><p>He said that sets \"a more realistic bar\" for the rest of the year, but also gives credence to the notion that \"the environment could be softening.\"</p><p>Fadem reiterated his overweight rating on the stock.</p><p>The stock has lost 2.4% over the past three months through Monday, while the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLY has dropped 16.5% and the Dow has eased 1.1%.</p><p>Home Depot stock falls after earnings beat, but outlook implies slowing growth</p>",
