  "title": "Business News:  Petco Revenue Rises In First Report Since Going Public  ----  By Charity L. Scott",
  "text": "<p>   At the height of the holiday season, Petco Health &amp; Wellness Co. moved nearly a third of its online business out of struggling delivery networks that were buckling under overwhelming package volumes. </p><p>   The payoff was apparent Thursday when the San Diego-based pet-store operator, in its first quarter after rejoining the public markets, posted a narrow loss and said revenue grew 16% from the previous year, to $1.3 billion. It also said it expects 2021 revenue to rise as much as about 9% as people splurge on pets that they acquired during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   Petco shares fell 3.8% in Thursday trading. </p><p>   The retailer struck a nationwide partnership with DoorDash in December that allowed it to start offering same-day delivery, which was a hit with online shoppers, Petco Chief Executive Ron Coughlin said in an interview. </p><p>   \"It's the fastest logistics shift I've seen in my career,\" he said. </p><p>   Petco fulfills 80% of its online orders through its more than 1,500 pet-care centers, which operate as traditional pet stores and fulfillment centers, Mr. Coughlin said, giving the company a logistics advantage. \"Two, three years ago people were saying, 'Are [the retail locations] albatrosses?'\" he said. \"They're absolutely sources of competitive advantage in our digital play today.\" </p><p>   While the bulk of Petco's online orders were fulfilled traditionally through package delivery, and face the same challenges as other larger retailers, same-day delivery relieved some of the pressure, Mr. Coughlin said. </p><p>   The shift to online shopping, accelerated by the pandemic, tested all three major carriers during the holiday season. </p><p>   The company attributed its $6.2 million loss, or 3 cents a share, to settling debt related to its January's initial public offering. The loss represented a 14% improvement year over year. \"We were profitable in Q2, we were profitable in Q3,\" Mr. Coughlin said. \"If it weren't for [the debt extinguishment], we would have been profitable in Q4 as well, and we will be profitable in 2021.\" </p><p>   Unlike other companies that did well during the pandemic, such as Home Depot Inc. and Best Buy Co., Mr. Coughlin said he doesn't expect Petco to be hurt by the lifting of Covid-19-related restrictions because the millions of new pets and new pet owners aren't going away. </p><p>   \"Those are upside to our business on a perpetual basis,\" he said. \"[Pets] have to be fed, they have to be groomed, they have to be vaccinated, versus, once you put in a new home gym, you're not going to do that again for five to 10 years.\" </p><p>   Some consumers are planning to spend more on their pets in a post pandemic world. Griffin Glasscock, 28 years old, said she has been scrupulous about her spending on her new puppy, a black mini labradoodle named Arnie, since she got him a month ago. \"I haven't overly splurged,\" she said, focusing her spending on basics and training classes. </p><p>   Petco bucked the recent trend of companies opting not to issue full-year guidance, saying it expects 2021 revenue of between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion, with earnings of between $0.63 and $0.66 per share. </p><p>   Petco was taken private by private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's biggest pension fund, in a $4.6 billion deal in 2016. </p><p></p>",
