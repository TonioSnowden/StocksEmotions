  "text": "<p>In the Olympiad of what we might call amateur crisis responders—a community of comfort-dog owners, itinerant pastors, pie-bakers and others who drop everything and hasten to the sites of mass shootings, natural disasters and other horrific events, to be of use in their particular, and sometimes peculiar, ways—Zanis was the gold medalist. The founder, and sole member, of an organization called Crosses for Losses, Zanis had delivered over 25,000 handmade memorial crosses, each about 4 feet tall, to the sites of murders, airplane crashes, natural disasters and other events where people had died violently before their time.</p><p>Zanis, who died in 2020, was best known for arriving at the site of mass shootings, which he had done since driving with his crosses to Columbine in 1999. Zanis built all the crosses himself. Each cross weighed about 30 pounds.</p><p>Zanis's change of life—from self-employed tradesman, building out the interiors of houses and restaurants around Chicago, to full-time Christian comfort worker—began in 1996, after he was the one to discover the lifeless body of his father-in-law, who had been shot dead. In a support group that he joined at his wife's church, he met a woman who offered him $20 to make a cross in memory of her 6-year-old son who had been killed. Zanis refused payment but made a cross for her, and soon for others in the group. And then for others.</p><p>With Columbine, he went national. Zanis had a very tolerant wife, a preternatural ability to stay awake on long drives and a new calling. Soon he was on the road most of the year. He put over half a million miles on four different trucks. \"I do everything,\" Zanis said. \"You heard about the fires in Paradise? I put up memorials in California. I went to the tornado in Alabama, where 23 people were killed. I went to the Sikh temple in Wisconsin.\" For Jews he erected Stars of David, for Muslims crescent moons. For atheists he carved a ribbon. (Some atheists have adopted a red and black lapel-style ribbon as their sign.) He tried to bring a cross to the site of every homicide in Chicago, which in 2018 had 561 of them.</p><p>On the morning of Oct. 28, as news agencies were first reporting the names of the 11 dead in Squirrel Hill, Zanis left Aurora in his truck and headed for Pittsburgh, 500 miles away. The paint was still wet on the wood in back. He didn't know how many Stars of David he would need, but that didn't matter. \"I have my tools and my Home Depot credit card,\" Zanis said. \"I have to build on the road.\"</p><p>Just after 2:30 p.m., Tammy Hepps, a Squirrel Hill resident who lived two blocks from Tree of Life Synagogue, was driving home when a truck pulled up in front of her. On the side of it were painted three curious words: \"Crosses for Losses.\" As Ms, Hepps remembers it, she looked into Zanis's truck and saw a pile of crosses in back. They were all white, and on a quick count she decided that there were 11 of them.</p><p>As soon as she grasped what she was seeing, she was incensed. \"I thought to myself, You have got to be f—ing kidding me,\" Ms. Hepps said. \"And I looked around, and no one else was there, and I thought, If I have to be the one to tell him he can't put crosses on the synagogue, I will be the one to tell him he can't put crosses on the synagogue.\"*</p><p>Ms. Hepps had no idea who this guy was, with this kind of nerve. As she was figuring out what to say to him, trying to keep her cool, she saw, on the front seat of his truck, a pile of wooden six-pointed stars. She was relieved. \"I thought, OK, what will happen here is he is going to put the Stars of David on the crosses, and it will be OK.\"</p><p>Zanis got out on the driver's side of the truck and approached Ms. Hepps. She looked him up and down: tired, unshaven, old. What was he doing here? Where had he come from? Then she looked down and saw his hands, and it was as if something became clear. \"I saw his hands were covered in white paint,\" Ms. Hepps remembered. \"It's like he painted these things overnight and didn't even have time to wash his hands. He told me his intention, said to me, 'I made these things, got in my truck, and drove nine hours.' He said to me, 'I have been driving the whole time. I don't even know the names of the people who died. I have to write their names on the stars.'\"</p><p>And then Ms. Hepps knew what she had to do. Her mother had emailed her the full list of the dead that morning, so she had the names on her phone: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, Irv Younger. \"I brought up this list, and he said to me, 'Can you please write the names in my notebook?' And he handed me a pen and his notebook, and I was shaking as I copied these names into his notebook—I have terrible handwriting—so he could write the names on the stars.\"</p><p>When Ms. Hepps had written down all 11 names, she gave Zanis's notebook back to him. Now she had a question: \"I said to him, 'Why do you do this?' He said that there had been gun violence in his family, and this was his response. He said, 'Do you remember Parkland? I did that one. Do you remember Columbine? I did that one, too.'\"</p><p>\"It had never occurred to me that it was one person who had made it his life's work to drive around the country and do this,\" Ms. Hepps said. \"And at that moment I realized we are just another one on the list.\"</p><p>Mr. Oppenheimer is the host of Tablet magazine's podcast 'Unorthodox.'
