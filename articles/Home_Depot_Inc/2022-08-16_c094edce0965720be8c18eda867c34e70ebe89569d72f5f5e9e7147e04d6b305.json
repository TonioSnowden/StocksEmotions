Global crude benchmark Brent fell 0.8% to trade at $94.37 a barrel.</p><p>The bond market continued to flash a recessionary signal, with the yield curve inverted. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 2.802% while the 2-year yield reached 3.218%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2%. In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed with the Shanghai Composite Index closing little changed and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declining 1.1%.</p><p>Stock Futures Wobble With Retail Earnings in Focus</p>",
