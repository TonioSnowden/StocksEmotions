  "title": "Private Sector's Role in Climate Fight Grows During War in Ukraine; Funding stays strong for businesses pursuing green projects despite market turbulence",
  "text": "<p>Despite the lack of progress by governments, businesses have continued to invest in green energy, often spurred on by demands from customers. Climate and sustainability startups have raised more than $20 billion in the first half of the year. That puts total fundraising slightly below last year's record pace but well ahead of the pace in 2019 and 2020, according to PitchBook. Sales of green bonds are also up compared with 2019 and 2020 levels, Dealogic data show.</p><p>That contrasts with setbacks, including the failure of the Biden administration's climate legislation in Congress. The latest frustration for green power companies was Thursday's U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>Startup financing is being augmented by spending pledges from established companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., BP PLC and Microsoft Corp. to kick-start new industries such as making hydrogen fuel from renewable electricity and removing carbon directly from the atmosphere.</p><p>\"Capital markets increasingly don't care that governments are broken,\" said Sheldon Kimber, CEO of clean-energy developer Intersect Power LLC. Intersect recently raised $750 million from investors including TPG Inc.'s climate fund to build more solar and battery-storage projects and expand into new areas such as green hydrogen.</p><p>Demand from businesses and new jobs are driving the energy transition, said Leo Denault, the chief executive of Entergy Corp., a utility that serves the Gulf Coast region, including the area's big fossil-fuel and chemical producers. He said government officials want economic growth and businesses want green energy, so regulators often support the utility's plans to add solar and wind power.</p><p>U.S. Steel Corp. recently asked Entergy if it could provide green electricity to serve a new electric arc furnace the steelmaker wanted to build in Arkansas. The company promised to create about 1,000 jobs paying roughly $100,000 a year. That helped Entergy get regulatory approval to add the green power.</p><p>Governments are still funding research for new technologies, proposing regulations and making investments in clean power, such as those included in last year's U.S. infrastructure bill. Total public and private global investment in clean energy is expected to rise more than 10% for the second consecutive year to nearly $1.45 trillion this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Such spending remained largely flat from 2017 to 2020.</p><p>The recent increase is being somewhat offset by inflation and isn't enough to avoid the worst effects of global warming, the IEA and scientists say. Roughly $2.8 trillion would be required to meet current climate pledges by 2030 and more than $4 trillion will be needed annually to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA says.</p><p>The private sector still needs to bolster its spending and avoid greenwashing, or misleading on climate progress, analysts say. Business priorities might not match up with those of policy makers, could leave poorer countries behind and could shift an economic downturn.</p><p>Some investors say the war in Ukraine has made building domestic supplies of clean energy a national-security issue. Many are still putting money into the sector while maintaining pressure on publicly traded companies to limit emissions. Shareholders have voted on about 275 sustainability-related proposals this year at company annual meetings, a record total that is up more than 40% from last year, according to the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute.</p><p>Investors are pushing companies such as Home Depot Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Jack in the Box Inc. to change, though such proposals don't always get results and many still receive muted support. Companies like Starbucks Corp. are also linking executive compensation or borrowing costs to meeting sustainability targets.</p><p>Even though a selloff in shares of many clean-energy companies has slowed new public listings to a trickle, some green startups that previously announced deals to go public by merging with special-purpose acquisition companies—or SPACs—are still closing them and raising money.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Can businesses make a difference in climate progress without the help of governments? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"The best hope we have to get this right is capital flows,\" said Stuart Landesberg, CEO of natural-consumer-products seller Grove Collaborative Holdings Inc., which recently raised more than $135 million in a combination with a SPAC backed by British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Mr. Landesberg said the company is well financed even though shares have fallen about 50% from the SPAC's listing price and many investors pulled their money out of the deal.</p><p>Polestar Automotive Holding U.K. PLC recently completed a SPAC merger that generated about $900 million for the Swedish electric-vehicle maker to expand production.</p><p>\"It's going to be the private sector that's really going to drive this,\" said Amy Yoder, CEO of clean fertilizer producer Anuvia Plant Nutrients, a Winter Park, Fla., startup that has privately raised about $170 million since early last year.</p><p>Some climate analysts are also hopeful that many startups that went public during last year's boom in new offerings and previously raised cash will deliver breakthroughs.</p><p>\"There is still a path being beaten to our doorstep from folks that want to work with us,\" said Doug Campbell, CEO of Solid Power Inc., a Colorado-based startup backed by Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG that is working to make next-generation solid-state batteries for electric cars.</p><p>The company recently began pilot production of battery cells for vehicles and hopes to get them into cars that are available to consumers in the next five years. Solid Power shares are down about 40% this year, but Mr. Campbell says the company has the cash it needs after raising about $650 million last year in a private investment round and SPAC deal.</p><p>Some investors expect new green stock and bond offerings will pick up despite this year's selloff in both markets, particularly as more large companies seek cheap, clean energy.</p><p>\"It's more like a speed bump,\" said Ella Hoxha, a senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management who oversees a climate-focused government-bond fund. \"It's very difficult to see the trend going away.\"</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Private Sector's Role in Climate Fight Grows During War in Ukraine</p>",
