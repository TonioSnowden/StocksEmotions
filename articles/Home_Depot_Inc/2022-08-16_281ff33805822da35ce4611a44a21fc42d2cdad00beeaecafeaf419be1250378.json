  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 280 points, or 0.8%, to trade at 34,191. If the blue-chip gauge closes at these levels, it would be its first close above 34,000 since May 4.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 8 points, or 0.2%, at 4,305.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP was down 26 points, or 0.2%, at 13,101.</p><p>Stocks rose Monday, with the Dow rising 151 points, or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.6%.

Maybe the economy has achieved the soft landing that people were hoping for.'\"</p><p>Read: This stock-market milestone indicates the S&amp;P 500 could be as much as 16% higher one year from today</p><p>Some market watchers, however, cautioned that the market could be getting ahead of itself.</p><p>\"We would caution investors against chasing this rally. We expect renewed market volatility ahead, and we continue to recommend positioning portfolios for resilience under various scenarios,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>\"With inflation still high, we favor value stocks including global energy. And with the economic outlook uncertain, we think investors can consider defensive equity exposure via global healthcare or quality income stocks,\" he wrote.</p><p>In addition to lifting the Dow, the strong earnings from Walmart and Home Depot helped lift shares of rival retailers, including Target Corp. TGT Lowe's Cos. LOW and Kohl's Corp. KSS , all three of which will report earnings later this week. Their shares were up 6%, 4% and 9.6%, respectively, while, Best Buy Co. Inc.

OSTKwere up 14%.</p><p>While investors on Reddit forums like Wall Street Bets cheered the rally in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson has advised investors that they should dump the stock, as the rally has led to \"unrealistic\" valuations.</p><p>Economic data released Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts fell 9.6% in July, while building permits were down1.3%.</p><p>In addition, U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in July, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
