  "text": "<p>Afghanistan's deposed president Ashraf Ghani <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a338537d-6a81-4dac-905c-fc3c6f9d2c8c\">defended his decision</a> to leave the country as the Taliban seized power, saying his life was in imminent danger and he is in talks to return.</p> <p>Resurfacing in the United Arab Emirates after days of speculation over his whereabouts, Ghani said in a video posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that he fled to avoid chaos as Taliban fighters swooped into Kabul over the weekend and toppled his government.</p> <p>“I had to leave <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65f61fb1-9462-4e25-990a-702812860b76\">Afghanistan</a> in order to prevent bloodshed, in order to make sure that a huge disaster is prevented,” Ghani said, according to a translation provided by Al Jazeera. “I'm in consultation with others to return so that I can continue my efforts for justice.”</p> <p>The ousted president has been criticised by members of his erstwhile government, who have accused him of betrayal and allowing the Taliban to take over Afghanistan in the wake of the US troop withdrawal.</p> <p>Ghani was also accused of looting Afghan coffers as he left, including allegations that he fled with a helicopter full of cash. He called the allegations “baseless lies” and said he left with only one change of clothes.</p> <h2>More on the fall of Afghanistan: </h2> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65f61fb1-9462-4e25-990a-702812860b76\">Afghanistan faces ‘dire' financial outlook, warns former central bank chief</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://ft.com/content/4a276093-cf85-4da7-9093-6af6443bb53a\">Here is a portrait of the final moments of freedom in Afghanistan that the world now knows is over</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a901224-629f-4377-9e3a-0f909ee1937c\">Mistrust and mysterious surrenders: how Kabul fell to the Taliban</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d4cbd68-2c49-4ddf-a68d-ee6b63a422cb\">How did America find itself fighting the last war — again?</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5f84e4e-d141-45f5-b015-dcec9ce61e2b\">Boris Johnson faces anger of MPs over UK response to Afghanistan</a>.
