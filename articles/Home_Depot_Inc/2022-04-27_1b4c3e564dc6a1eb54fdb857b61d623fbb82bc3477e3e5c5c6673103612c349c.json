  "title": "The CIO Brief Gets Bigger—This Time to Focus on Customers; Long the guardians of a business's internal IT, CIOs are increasingly getting involved in the customer-facing services that became vital in the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>\"As consumers relied heavily on the internet for life, work and play, their preference for fast, frictionless interactions with brands accelerated,\" said Kevin Vasconi, chief information officer of Wendy's Co.</p><p>Mr. Vasconi has been tending to the fast-food chain's underlying enterprise IT needs—shifting its entire resource-planning system to the cloud, among other projects. But since the pandemic struck, he has also been working directly with the company's marketing group to build mobile food-ordering apps and other customer-facing services, he said. Wendy's U.S. digital sales grew by nearly 75% in 2020 compared with the previous year, the company said.</p><p>For restaurant operators, Mr. Vasconi more recently led the installation of new point-of-sales tablets aimed at streamlining customer service at the busiest drive-through lanes, he said.</p><p>Across sectors, CIOs have spent the past two years creating digital storefronts and offices via online shopping tools, mobile ordering and pickup apps, videoconferencing and collaboration systems, and other outward-facing platforms. As these become established parts of daily operations, the range of CIO responsibilities has stretched to include more customer-experience technology.</p><p>Last week, Home Depot Inc. announced an overhaul in its tech leadership structure, putting long-serving CIO Matt Carey in charge of customer-facing tech, and naming a new CIO to oversee internal IT.</p><p>Sathish Muthukrishnan, Ally Financial Inc.'s chief information, data and digital officer, said his unique role—cultivated over the past two years—straddles IT, user experience, and product and design development, among other areas. The structure puts him at the intersection of both internal and external technology, which provided a critical vantage point when Covid-19 struck, he said.</p><p>\"Just as at every other company, we also saw tremendous adoption of capabilities as well as acceleration in usage,\" Mr. Muthukrishnan said.</p><p>While his customer-facing team develops new apps and services to capitalize on increased traffic—online auto loans and mortgage deferments, for instance—his IT team is focused on improving tech support for the company's customer-care workers.</p><p>Under his watch, Mr. Muthukrishnan said, \"Ally is in the process of complete modernization of servicing capabilities.\"</p><p>Google Cloud Chief Executive Thomas Kurian said last month that he expects every industry over the next five to eight years to completely transform the way it is digitizing relationships with customers, citing the rapid expansion of online services in shopping, banking, insurance and healthcare. The role of CIO, he said, \"has changed materially.\"</p><p>Tim Crawford, CIO strategic advisor at Los Angeles-based enterprise IT advisory firm AVOA, commented that a CIO who \"understands the underlying technology could be a powerful asset when focused on customer experience in terms of understanding the tools, capabilities, integrations and requirements.\"</p><p>Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, said Home Depot's promotion of its veteran CIO to full-time customer-experience leader reflects its determination to double down on the kinds of digital services that helped capture a pandemic surge in demand from did-it-yourself home-improvement shoppers.</p><p>Like a growing number of companies, Mr. Saunders said, \"Home Depot is saying, 'OK, the customer's become more digital. We're probably going to have to look at adding additional tools'.\"</p><p>It also comes amid an evolving mind-set that businesses need to take a more customer-centric approach to technology, along with a larger role for enterprise IT in making sales.</p><p>\"A lot of CIOs are being pushed to broaden their remit,\" said Chuck Gray, partner and head of the U.S. technology officers practice at management-advisory firm Egon Zehnder. \"It may have started in consumer-facing industries, but you can now see the trend everywhere.\"</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p><p>The CIO Brief Gets Bigger—This Time to Focus on Customers</p>",
