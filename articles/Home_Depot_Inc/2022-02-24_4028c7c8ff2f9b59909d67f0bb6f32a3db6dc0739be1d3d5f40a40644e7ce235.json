  "title": "Wayfair Braces for Pandemic-Fueled Online Shopping Spree to Slow Down; Active customer numbers have dropped about 13% as executives say people are returning to physical stores",
  "text": "<p>Wayfair Inc. is grappling not only with inflation denting consumers' spending power, but also people shifting their purchases to physical stores as Covid-19 pandemic restrictions ease.</p><p>During the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, the online furniture seller enjoyed a captive audience, as lockdowns kept shoppers indoors and focused on sprucing up their homes. It added millions of customers in 2020, and posted its first annual profit as a public company.</p><p>Wayfair's growth last year didn't keep pace with 2020. The company on Thursday reported a quarterly loss for the second consecutive quarter, and said fourth-quarter revenue fell more than 11% from a year earlier to $3.25 billion, a figure slightly below forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Active customers in 2021 fell roughly 13% to 27.3 million. Wayfair measures active customers as any shopper who has placed an order within the past 12 months.</p><p>\"Although household savings remain robust, our customers are seeing widespread inflation impact their lives and pressure their wallets,\" Michael Fleisher, Wayfair's chief financial officer, told analysts. \"They also have more choices around where to direct their dollars as pandemic restrictions ease.\"</p><p>Wayfair was one of several large retailers that benefited from the dramatic shift in America's spending habits during the pandemic, when companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Home Depot Inc., posted soaring quarterly sales and profits.</p><p>Executives said they remained confident in the growth of the home-goods category but noted that the direction of the larger economy remains difficult to predict.</p><p>Wayfair shares closed Thursday up nearly 5% at $127.07 in a roller-coaster session. Shares opened the day 17% lower than Wednesday's close after the company reported a steeper-than-expected loss of $202 million, or $1.92 a share, in the quarter featuring the key holiday shopping season. The company's share price has fallen 51% over the past 12 months.</p><p>Home Depot earlier this week said its sales growth would likely slow in 2022, indicating a potential slowdown in the home-improvement market that expanded rapidly in the past two years.</p><p>Last week, Shopify Inc. told investors that the shift in shopping dollars to online stores fueled by the pandemic was beginning to slow.</p><p>Wayfair, founded in 2002, built itself into an e-commerce juggernaut by following the Amazon playbook of offering a near-limitless range of products, much of which ships free. The company was largely reliant on expensive marketing to attract shoppers, generating big sales and even bigger losses.</p><p>The company said spending on capital expenditures would be between $95 million and $105 million in the first quarter and higher overall for the full year, as Wayfair builds out its bricks-and-mortar strategy and opens new fulfillment centers. The furniture seller announced in December that it would open three stores for its AllModern and Joss &amp; Main brands this year. Mr. Shah said the company plans to open a larger Wayfair store in 2023.</p><p>Write to Charity L.
