  "title": "The Unexpectedly Chic Halloween Decor Hiding at Home Depot; We tasked Mexican designer Aranza García with sifting through seasonal offerings from the mass-market retailer and other mainstream brands to find spooky decor good-looking enough for her own home. Here, her spirited selections.",
  "text": "<p>Here, she shares her top picks from five mass-furnishing retailers.</p><p>Scary Servers</p><p>Day of the Dead festivities share some of American Halloween's playfully morbid iconography (festooned skulls and Mariachi skeletons, for example). For a party, Ms. García would bring in this handy take on a footed bowl, whose witchy talons and bangled wrists are both \"fun and sexy.\" The creepy clutches and supporting \"books\" of resin-stone composite serve up removable glass bowls. Witch Hands Snack Bowl Stand, $229, GrandinRoad.com</p><p>Strange Hello</p><p>Pier 1 pushed a simple concept, a 42-inch wooden sign, into clever territory, says Ms. García, by framing its message in creepy webs and adding a dangling, eight-legged tenant. Like magic, warm-white LED lights powered by two AA batteries, (not included) illuminate the \"Boo\" and give the message dimension beyond the high contrast of the black typeface against traffic-cone orange. Lighted Wooden Porch Sign, $71, Pier1.com</p><p>Pick of the Patch</p><p>\"Halloween décor all tends to look the same,\" lamented Ms. García, which is why this pumpkin dish in the latest Birch Lane catalog captured her attention. \"The burnt orange hue in combination with the shiny gold hardware is subtle but still eye-catching,\" she said. Crafted from durable cast-iron, the piece weighs in at 15 pounds, so it \"won't tip over or spill easily,\" added Ms. García. Cast Iron 5.49-quart Pumpkin Cocotte, $500, BirchLane.com</p><p>Happy Sacks</p><p>Ms. García was pleasantly surprised to find Home Depot's metal lantern set, a nostalgic riff on paper shopping bags that hauled kids' Halloween loot before plastic jack-o-lantern buckets relegated them to obscurity. \"I think the reinterpretation is an elegant design,\" she said. A tea light placed inside will reflect the orange interior through cutouts of \"Trick or Treat\" and \"Boo\" in the matte-black surfaces. Metal Halloween Trick or Treat Bucket, Set of Two, $29, HomeDepot.com</p><p>Royal Blush</p><p>The fall Target catalog offers three styles of push-pin decorating kits, but Ms. García fell for the eight-piece princess puss. \"I love the bright colors—pink, purple, green—and the feminine aesthetic is fantastic,\" she said. Fun on any fruit or veggie that will hold the poked-in plastic pieces, the cartoonish eyes, cheeks and lips, as well as bedazzling accessories conjure a sweet, not scary, countenance without the mess of pumpkin guts. \"I never thought I'd need something like this in my life, but I do,\" said Ms. García.
