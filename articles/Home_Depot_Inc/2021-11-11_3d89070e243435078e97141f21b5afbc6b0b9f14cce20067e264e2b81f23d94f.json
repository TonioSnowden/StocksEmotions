  "title": "Here's where service members can get deals and discounts on Veterans Day",
  "text": "<p>The stock market is open on Veterans Day, and most other businesses stay open during the federal holiday, as well.</p><p>And many of them are offering special discounts and perks for veterans this year.</p><p>That includes Krispy Kreme DNUT and Dunkin' dishing free donuts; IHOP and Denny's flipping free pancakes, and StarbucksSBUX pouring free coffee. Nearly all of these deals are for in-store customers only — so online orders are excluded. More Veteran's Day food deals include free entrees from Olive Garden and Applebee's. And all of these deals are for veterans as well as active military members.</p><p>Read more:Worry about ice-cold demand, not red-hot inflation, this strategist argues. How to play that scenario</p><p>Special offers for veterans are not just limited to food, however. From Nov. 11 through Nov. 14, WalgreensWBA is offering veterans, active-duty military and their families 20% off eligible store items at any Walgreens or Duane Reade store.</p><p>Other retailers are joining in on the Veterans Day discounts. Kohl's is doubling its typical military discount from 15% to 30% from Nov. 7 to Nov. 11, and Under Armour UAA is offering service members and their families 40% off all purchases on the company's website between Nov. 5 and Nov. 11.</p><p>Target TGT is also offering a 10% military discount through Nov. 13 — to qualify, service members must verify their military status prior to making purchases.</p><p>See also: Can you buy Shiba Inu on Robinhood?</p><p>Other notable discounts come from businesses including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond BBBY, Food Lion, Dollar General DG and Home Depot HD, Little Caesars and Chili's.</p><p>Military news resource military.com&#xa0;has compiled a list of the hundreds of available events, discounts and free items available to U.S. veterans this year.</p><p>Some businesses require servicemen and women to show proof that they are serving or have served in the military, so in some instances veterans may have to provide identification. But many places also count being dressed in uniform as a form of identification.</p>",
