  "title": "Home Depot Expects Sales Growth to Slow in 2022; Latest quarter sustains pandemic-era gains from a flood of home-improvement activity",
  "text": "<p>Shares were down by 9% on Tuesday, on pace for their largest daily decline since the first days of the coronavirus crisis in March 2020. The stock is still up by about 13% over 12 months.</p><p>Macroeconomic concerns like rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions have pummeled stocks so far in 2022, sending the S&amp;P 500 down about 10% year to date. Against that backdrop, Home Depot's forward guidance on Tuesday wasn't rosy enough to stir investors' enthusiasm, said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at Truist Securities Inc.</p><p>\"We're in a really tough space where people think anything but a strong beat and a raise is going to be sold,\" he said</p><p>Concerns about Home Depot's gross margins, a measure of profitability, may also be turning investors pessimistic, Mr. Ciccarelli said. The metric has been declining recently, partly because of investments that Home Depot has made in its supply chain, he said.</p><p>Still, the end of 2021 continued Home Depot's streak of pandemic-era sales growth. The Atlanta-based company saw its revenue for the three months through January grow by 11% to $35.72 billion, from $32.26 billion a year earlier. Those gains helped bring Home Depot to its first fiscal year with more than $150 billion in annual sales.</p><p>Home Depot also said Tuesday it will raise its dividend by 15%, to $7.60 per share annually.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, Home Depot's comparable sales figure, which adjusts for store openings and closings, increased by 8.1%. That trend, though flatter than the company's growth earlier in the pandemic, shows Home Depot is still building on gains stemming from a flood of home-improvement activity.</p><p>The number of transactions declined by 3.8% on a comparable basis, but the average transaction value was up 12%. Inflation in several product categories was responsible for much of that gain, Home Depot's chief operating officer, Ted Decker, told analysts on a conference call.</p><p>Between mid-2020 and mid-2021, the retailer posted four straight quarters of comparable sales growth above 20%, fueled by consumers' surging demand for home-improvement goods as the public-health crisis's social disruptions left people spending more time in their houses.</p><p>Against rising prices, demand from homeowners remains strong, Home Depot finance chief Richard McPhail said, adding that keeping inventories healthy has been a priority.</p><p>\"Right now, it's more a situation of staying in stock,\" Mr. McPhail said. \"We're paying more attention to the impact of staying in stock, compared with how inflation might impact us.\"</p><p>The demand fueling the company's sales growth has evolved as the pandemic progresses. The first phase of the crisis often brought in customers eager to buy home necessities and to tackle do-it-yourself projects around the house. As the pandemic's acute early phases subsided, Home Depot saw sales to professional contractors grow, with homeowners becoming more comfortable bringing workers into their homes again.</p><p>That trend continued in the latest quarter, executives said Tuesday, with growth in sales to contractors outpacing do-it-yourself sales growth. Departments involving more heavy-duty projects, such as electrical, plumbing and building supplies, saw some of the company's fastest growth rates in the January-ending quarter.</p><p>Home Depot's fourth-quarter net earnings were $3.35 billion, or $3.21 a share, up from $2.65 a share 12 months earlier.</p><p>Wall Street analysts surveyed by FactSet had been forecasting earnings of $3.18 a share on sales of $34.88 billion.</p><p>The quarter marked Home Depot's last full earnings period with Craig Menear as its chief executive. Mr. Decker will become CEO next week, Home Depot said in January. Mr. Menear, who has been CEO since 2014, will remain Home Depot's chairman.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Home Depot Expects Sales Growth to Slow in 2022</p>",
