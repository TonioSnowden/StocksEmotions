  "title": "U.S. News: Business Lobbying Limits Tax Increases --- Tobacco firms, banks and private equity are among the winners in shaping Democratic bill",
  "text": "<p>Lobbyists for private equity killed a $14 billion tax increase after an advocacy campaign helped persuade Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) that it would harm business in her state.</p><p>Tobacco companies and convenience stores scaled back a nearly $100 billion tax increase on nicotine products after convincing key Democrats that the new taxes would fall heavily on low-income Americans. The bill that passed the House raises nicotine taxes by about $9 billion over a decade, largely affecting the vaping industry.</p><p>Wall Street firms defeated efforts by progressive Democrats to impose a new tax on financial transactions by arguing it would hurt the economic recovery.</p><p>While the bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on businesses, the wins by many lobbies show the continued influence of business in Washington despite growing ranks of progressives in the Democratic Party.</p><p>\"The pro-corporate strain is still strong within the party,\" said Adam Jentleson, who worked as a senior strategist to Harry Reid when the Nevada Democrat was Senate majority leader. \"The pro-worker side continues to gain strength, but the pro-corporate side has the power,\" he said.</p><p>Companies and interest groups spent a record $903 million on lobbying in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to an analysis of public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization tracking the amount of money in politics. That was an almost 5% increase over lobbying spending during the same period in the final year of Mr. Trump's presidency.</p><p>The legislation includes much of Mr. Biden's domestic agenda, such as measures aimed at slowing global warming and strengthening the social safety net. After passing the House, the legislation now goes to the Senate.</p><p>Democratic leaders seek to fund much of the new spending with increased taxes on businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. and other oil-and-gas companies, U.S. multinationals such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., and companies that buy back shares of their own stock.</p><p>One provision raises funds from some for-profit prison companies, such as GEO Group Inc., by subjecting their earnings to taxes.</p><p>Suzanne Clark, president and chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the bill improved for industry, citing the business lobby's defeat of Mr. Biden's plans to increase taxes on corporate profits and capital gains.</p><p>The Chamber continued to oppose the bill. On Thursday, it announced a new round of advertisements calling on Congress to defeat it.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest winner in the House bill was private equity. For years, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and others have complained that private-equity managers pay tax at the long-term capital-gains rate, rather than the higher rate applied to individual income.</p><p>When Mr. Biden took office, private equity launched a lobbying effort to convince a few dozen centrist Democrats that increased taxes for private equity would lower the amount of money invested in small businesses and real-estate development in their states.</p><p>Using advanced digital tactics, lobbyists identified a small circle of Ms. Sinema's political advisers, staff and campaign donors and purchased ads on their Twitter and Facebook pages that repeated the argument that increasing private-equity taxes would hurt investment and jobs in Arizona, according to information reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The chief tax writer in the House, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), had been advancing the House's version of Mr. Biden's bill that included the $14 billion tax increase affecting private equity.</p><p>Mr. Neal moved the bill through the Ways and Means Committee and prepared for a vote by the full House.</p><p>A few weeks ago House Democratic leaders dropped the private-equity tax measure from Mr. Biden's bill.</p><p>---</p><p>Labor, Trial Lawyers</p><p>Also Get Victories</p><p>Business groups aren't the only ones who scored wins in shaping the Democratic bill.</p><p>Lobbyists for organized labor secured a tax change allowing members to deduct a portion of their union dues. The United Auto Workers benefits from a provision that gives consumers a bigger tax credit on electric vehicles built by union members.</p><p>Trial lawyers got language that permits them to deduct certain expenses for cases taken on a contingency basis.</p><p>There were industry-specific wins. Home Depot Inc. and other retailers got an extension of tax incentives for purchases of energy-efficient appliances and other home products.</p>",
