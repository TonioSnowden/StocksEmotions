  "text": "<p><em>For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.<br>For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.<br>For want of a horse, the rider was lost.<br>For want of a rider, the battle was lost.<br>For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost.<br>And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.</em></p> <p>Dear readers,</p> <p>The old nursery rhyme quoted above encapsulates the problem with stretched supply chains. Only one link needs to break for the entire system to collapse. That has been the overriding theme this week as shortages and price spikes proliferated across world business.</p> <p>The chip industry has clear parallels with the rhyme's lamed horse and imperilled kingdom. Shipments from big chipmakers such Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e54e4365-5f1a-4ce9-881a-37394b236fc8\">exposed to disruption</a> on multiple fronts.</p> <p>At the low-tech end, cardboard boxes — into which contractors pack finished silicon chips — are in short supply. That also applies to silicon itself. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/365fd098-7e16-48e3-9332-73677128555a\">Prices have quadrupled</a> as a result of coal shortages in China where most of the material is made.</p> <p>The problem is compounded by the segmentation of chipmaking. TSMC, for instance, makes its chips in Taiwan for assembly, with testing and packaging in south-east Asia, followed by incorporation into circuit boards in China.</p> <p>Normally, that is efficient. It exemplifies the specialisation of function extolled by the great Scottish economist Adam Smith in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>. But it also means problems with one stage of production — such as the closure of Vietnamese and Malaysian factories during the pandemic — disrupt all the others.</p> <p>We remain bullish on chipmakers despite TSMC's faltering share price. Chinese sabre-rattling about Taiwan is likely to be one factor in that weakness, as one reader pointed out. But demand for microprocessors should remain brisk long after supply chain snafus have been resolved.</p> <p>Electric vehicles contain a lot more semiconductors than the petrol and diesel cars they are superseding. Lithium is another necessity in their own supply chain, as it is a vital material in EV batteries.</p> <p>Lex has been bearish on this commodity because reserves data have vastly understated its availability. That has not stopped the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c3933bb-b0d4-4d04-b8a9-09c7c675f66f\">lithium price quadrupling</a> over a year. Miners have underinvested in new capacity, though money is now pouring into the industry. The $770m purchase of Canada's Neo Lithium by Zijin Mining of China was one sign of that.</p> <p>Current supply chaos is a consequence of a sharp revival in economic activity in the wake of a pandemic that left many businesses idled. The failure of governments to plan the shift to renewables has amplified the jump in hydrocarbon prices. Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1367a53d-975a-4b23-995a-38b028ab2295\">awarded booby prizes</a> to the EU, for depending on gas from manipulative Russia, and to the UK, for running down its storage.</p> <p>A host of other, more local factors, has exacerbated supply problems. Consider <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4e57864-ff5f-40e8-8c15-8c5824b1203d\">Felixstowe</a>, the UK's largest container port. Shipping groups such as Maersk of Denmark have been diverting cargos away from quays clogged with containers awaiting unloading or collection.</p> <p>Congestion is also gripping US ports. The US president has notably picked the high-employment legacy businesses of Walmart, Target, Home Depot and FedEx to help <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7fd9906-d8b5-4c51-a663-565528e4e3d7\">sort out the mess</a>, rather than any of Silicon Valley's self-appointed experts on everything.</p> <p>Lex reckons the capacity of Santa Biden's little helpers to move containers is too low to make much difference and that it will cost them a lot money. But the retailers may recoup some of their costs in market share gains if they have full shelves for Christmas.</p> <p>Port gridlock looks like a market failure to us. You might cynically posit that clearing logjams is of only tangential interest to the world's alliances of shipping companies, given that freight rates have tripled.</p> <p>Bankers must be very glad they do not have to deal with the mind-bending complexity of getting a toy robot from a factory in Guangdong to a small boy in Syracuse, New York, in time for Christmas. They only have to do easy stuff, like structuring leveraged equity collars for megalomaniac hedge fund managers.</p> <p>Wall Street sailed confidently through its latest quarterly earnings week thanks to the surge in financing activity that includes a boom in initial public offerings. Morgan Stanley's investment bank produced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0646242-1a5a-4958-b7e0-b2a0f9903fcf\">blowout numbers</a>.</p> <p>JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon sounded a more cautious note. That reflected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99aaa433-3221-4615-839a-642b34c26d19\">slow loan growth</a> and challenges from fintech challengers such as Square and PayPal. The bank comfortably beat expectations, even so.</p> <p>Finally, hats off to Henry Kravis and George Roberts, who announced their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828c08e8-caff-4c3b-a41d-de152fcf5216\">departure from KKR</a>, the buyout group that bears their names. During their 35-year incumbency, private equity has grown from a scrappy challenger to a central feature of US capitalism.</p> <p>As the cousins signalled this week, private capital is no longer a mere tributary of the public market. Instead, alternative asset managers have built a parallel power nexus that increasingly deploys permanent capital of its own.</p> <p>The erstwhile barbarians at the gate are encamped in the citadel.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend,</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong><br><em>Head of Lex</em></p> <p>P.S. We were amused to see Lex make an appearance in a “making of the movie” video online concerning the new Bond film <em>No Time to Die</em>. Is it a good thing to be the preferred reading of M, a spy master who accidentally allows a criminal mastermind to obtain a weapon of mass destruction? We will leave it to his fellow readers to judge.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2021 'Best of Lex: only disconnect to derail the world supply chain' FT.com 15 October.
