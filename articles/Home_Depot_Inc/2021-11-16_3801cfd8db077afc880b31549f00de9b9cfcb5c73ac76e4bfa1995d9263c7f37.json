  "text": "<p>Markets have lost the momentum that propelled stocks to a series of records earlier in the fall. Investors are preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by next summer to check the pace of consumer-price growth, which is running at a three-decade high. Higher rates could knock stocks and other riskier assets that have benefited from 18 months of stimulus from the central bank.</p><p>Another concern for money managers is that inflation will cool the economy of its own accord by acting as a brake on consumers. But in a sign Americans stepped up spending again this fall, Walmart reported another quarter of higher sales, raising shares 0.4% premarket.</p><p>Home Depot also reported higher sales, boosting shares of the home-improvement retailer 0.7% ahead of the bell. For further evidence on the strength of consumption, investors parsed data on retail sales.</p><p>Frank Ã˜land Winther, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, said inflation was one reason why he expected stock markets to grow more volatile, along with trouble in China's property sector and Covid-19 cases in Europe.</p><p>\"The returns we have seen this year so far just cannot continue,\" said Mr. Winther, adding that Danske was considering trimming its holdings of U.S. stocks and shifting some of the money into investment-grade corporate bonds.</p><p>In the bond market, yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.609% Tuesday from 1.621% Monday. Yields, which move in the opposite direction to bond prices, posted their biggest three-day advance through Monday since November 2020.</p><p>In one sign that riskier assets are losing momentum, cryptocurrencies retreated. Bitcoin briefly fell below $59,000, its lowest price in November. Investors pointed to the stronger dollar as a catalyst for the fall.</p><p>The decline hit stocks in the crypto industry. Bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase Global was down 2.9% premarket and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital slid 6.3%.</p><p>Figures on industrial production, scheduled for 9:15 a.m., will give another perspective on the economy. Production, which covers output at factories, mines and utilities, pulled back in September as supply-chain disruptions crimped activity.</p><p>European natural gas prices jumped almost 10% to a three-week high after German regulators suspended the certification process for a new pipeline linking Russia to Germany. Traders had hoped that Nord Stream 2, which is completed but not operational, would start to send gas toward Western Europe in the coming months. The pipeline, which is opposed by the U.S., could ease a gap in European supplies during peak winter demand.</p><p>Gold prices rose 0.1% to $1,869 a troy ounce. The precious metal has rallied to five-month highs in a sign of growing unease about the inflation outlook.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. Gains for telecom and auto stocks pushed the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.3%. Vodafone Group rose more than 5% after the U.K. telecom company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp jumped 5.4% after a media report said the German conglomerate was looking to list its electrolysis unit.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Flat After Earnings From Walmart, Home Depot</p>",
