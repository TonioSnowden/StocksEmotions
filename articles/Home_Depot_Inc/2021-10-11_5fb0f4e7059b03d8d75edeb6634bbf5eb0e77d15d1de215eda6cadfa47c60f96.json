  "title": "The huge demand for shipping from China juiced this company's profit, and it expects much more",
  "text": "<p>U.S. retailers have struggled to move goods as supply-chain and staffing issues have bogged down the flow. The problem has led some retailers — including Target Corp. TGT, Walmart Inc. WMT, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST and Home Depot Inc. HD— to charter their own ships to obtain goods, as MarketWatch reported last week.</p><p>See: Large retailers are chartering ships to bypass supply chain problems. Will the strategy save Christmas?</p><p>Matson MATXdisclosed Monday afternoon that increased demand for its shipping services will lead to greater-than-expected profit. Matson added a second shipping route from China to Southern California in May 2020, then another one to Northern California earlier this year, known as the CCX.</p><p>“Our China service continued to see significant demand for its expedited ocean services, including the new CCX service, as volume for e-commerce, garments and other goods remained elevated heading into the peak season,” Chief Executive Matt Cox said in a statement. “Continued strong demand for the China service was the primary driver of the increase in consolidated operating income year over year.”</p><p>Matson said that it expects third-quarter operating profit in its Ocean Transportation division to reach $358 million to $363 million, when analysts were expecting operating profit for the entire company to be $269 million, according to FactSet. That big beat led Matson to predict third-quarter net income of $277.3 million to $285.5 million, or $6.39 to $6.58 a share, which blows away the average analyst estimate of $4.39 a share.</p><p>Executives do not believe the issues will go away after the holiday shopping season, either, predicting that they will stick around for at least the next nine months,</p><p>“Currently, supply-chain congestion continues in the Transpacific trade lane, with the combination of inventory restocking, peak season and ongoing elevated consumption trends,” Cox said.&#xa0;“We expect these conditions to remain largely in place at least through mid-year 2022.”</p><p>Matson expects to fully report third-quarter financial results on Nov. 3.</p><p>Matson shares increased more than 2.5% in after-hours trading following the announcement, after closing with a 0.7% increase at $82.67. Shares have experienced a revival amid the shipping difficulties, rising 21.4% in the past three months, as the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 0.5%.</p>",
