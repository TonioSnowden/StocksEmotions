  "title": "Stores Like Home Depot and Best Buy Bolster Security After 'Flash Mob' Robberies; Retailers lock up more products and California police increase patrols to combat thefts by criminal groups",
  "text": "<p>The recent thefts mark an increase in intensity because of the size of the groups and the organized nature of the crimes, said some retail and security executives. During the Nordstrom theft, dozens of people arrived at the store in cars at the same time, rushed inside to cause chaos and steal items, and then drove away. The police made a handful of arrests.</p><p>\"We do see flash mobs with some level of regularity. We saw some issues last week in California,\" though the recent incidents have been larger scale, said Scott Glenn, vice president of asset protection for Home Depot Inc. Several of the chain's product categories, such as power tools, are frequent targets of theft. \"The last couple of weeks is not surprising to us,\" he said.</p><p>Retail and security executives said those events are part of a sharp rise in organized retail theft since the Covid-19 pandemic began, in part because e-commerce growth has led to more demand for underpriced goods online.</p><p>The National Retail Federation estimates that organized retail crime, a distinct category from shoplifting overall, costs retailers an average of $700,000 per $1 billion in sales. Stolen goods such as power tools, medicine and pricey handbagsare often resold anonymously through Amazon.com, Facebook Marketplace and other platforms, these executives said.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Meta Platforms Inc. said Facebook prohibits selling stolen items and asks people or retailers to report criminal activity to local law enforcement. Amazon doesn't allow sellers to list stolen goods and works with law enforcement and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, a spokeswoman for Amazon.com Inc. said.</p><p>At Home Depot, theft apprehensions, when store personnel seize a suspect, are up about 10% year-over-year, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>The home improvement retailer is hiring more security for stores and changing the physical layout of entrances to prevent theft, for example adding more gates that only allow traffic to flow into stores at an entrance, not out, said Mr. Glenn. Recently the company started adding technology to some items that makes a product inoperable until it is checked out through a register, he said. \"We can't stop everyone coming in and taking product,\" he said. \"We can make it harder.\"</p><p>A group of district attorneys in Northern California recently said they would each be detailing a prosecutor from their offices to work together on stopping the thefts. \"These are clearly carefully orchestrated crimes, working together in large groups to create a mob-like mentality,\" said Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley in a statement.</p><p>After two businesses in the city of Alameda, Calif., were targeted by organized thieves in November, the police department there advised local businesses to take special precautions, including installing a shatterproof film over store windows, adding motion sensor cameras, and removing high-value items from store floors.</p><p>The California Highway Patrol, which has had an organized crime retail theft task force since 2019, said on Nov. 23 that it would start increasing patrols on freeway corridors near major shopping centers to help combat the crimes.</p><p>Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody on Thursday announced a task force to specifically target organized retail theft and the creation of a database to track retail robberies statewide.</p><p>Organized group store theft has been around for years.</p><p>In the summer of 2011, around 40 people swarmed a suburban Searsnear Philadelphia and stole thousands of dollars in goods, according to a Wall Street Journal article at the time. Earlier that year several chains, including North Face and Armani Exchange faced similar incidents in Chicago. That year the National Retail Federation said that flash-mob attacks were reported by 10% of the 106 retailers it surveyed.</p><p>Around 69% of retailers reported a rise in organized retail crime in 2020, according to an NRF survey this year with 41 responses. A similar number of retailers said organized retail crime groups \"exhibit greater levels of violence and aggression than they have before.\"</p><p>Retailers are employing a bigger security presence as a short-term response to the type of theft seen over the past few weeks, said Ben Dugan, director of organized retail crime at CVS Health Corp. and president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail, a group that facilitates planning between retailers and law enforcement.</p><p>CVS has doubled the size of its corporate staff working on organized retail crime this year compared with last, he said. Longer term, the drugstore chain is working with local law-enforcement officials in several states to coordinate theft response, as well as supporting federal legislation that retailers hope will make reselling of stolen goods online more difficult, said Mr. Dugan.</p><p>Retail theft, particularly by organized groups, is rising at Best Buy Co. and is eating into the company's profits, said Chief Executive Corie Barry on a call to discuss earnings last month.</p><p>The electronics chain is finding new ways to lock up products with less inconvenience to customers, she said, such as allowing people to pay by scanning a QR code before leaving with a product from locked cases. Locking up goods on shelves, as many drugstores do, can hamper sales since it can deter some shoppers who need to find a staffer to access an item. Best Buy is also hiring security and changing store layouts, she said.</p><p>\"You can see that pressure in our financials,\" said Ms. Barry. \"And more importantly, frankly, you can see that pressure with our associates. This is traumatizing.\"</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com and Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com</p><p>Stores Like Home Depot and Best Buy Bolster Security After 'Flash Mob' Robberies</p>",
