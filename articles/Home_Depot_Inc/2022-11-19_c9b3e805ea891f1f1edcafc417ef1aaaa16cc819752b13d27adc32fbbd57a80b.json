  "text": "<p>What is it like to run Tesla and Twitter Inc. at the same time? Billionaire Elon Musk said Monday at a virtual conference that he has \"too much work on his plate\" since taking over the social-media platform while overseeing the electric-vehicle maker. A Tesla board member testified Wednesday in a trial over Mr. Musk's pay package that Mr. Musk recently floated the possibility of a successor. Mr. Musk also emailed Twitter employees demanding they commit to \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave. Tesla shares dropped 2.6% Monday, and fell 3.9% Wednesday.</p><p>NVIDIA CORP.</p><p>NVDA -4.5%</p><p>The semiconductor business is powering down. Nvidia on Wednesday issued a tepid outlook and posted a sharp decline in quarterly sales due to waning demand for its videogaming chips. The semiconductor giant and its peers have been hit hard by pressures on consumer spending, including high inflation and rising interest rates. The muted forecast followed Micron Technology Inc.'s cut in its production plans for next year. The computer-memory chip maker said that it was working to reduce capital spending further. Nvidia shares decreased 4.5% Wednesday.</p><p>TARGET CORP.</p><p>TGT -13%</p><p>Target's sales were off the mark. The retail giant on Wednesday said consumers pulled back on their spending in recent weeks, sapping sales and profits in the latest quarter. Sales rose at rival Walmart Inc., though it said consumers bought fewer electronics and home goods. The divergent results come ahead of the critical Black Friday, one of the largest single shopping days. Target shares plummeted 13% Wednesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -1.8%</p><p>The nation's largest online retailer became the latest tech company to shed workers amid a slowing economy. On Wednesday Amazon announced it would be trimming from its corporate ranks, in a rare round of cuts for a company that has mostly seen consistent growth through its history. The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon could cut about 10,000 jobs, which would affect roughly 3% of its corporate staff. The cuts don't appear likely to affect the company's hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. Amazon shares fell 1.8% Wednesday.</p><p>LOWE'S COS.</p><p>LOW +3%</p><p>The home-improvement industry is rebuilding. Lowe's on Wednesday reported higher quarterly sales, driven by strong demand from professional customers and improved spending among Americans working on their own projects. A day earlier, rival Home Depot Inc. also logged rising sales, as higher prices offset slowing transactions. Inflation and rising mortgage rates have prompted fears of a slowdown after both companies benefited from a surge in home-improvement spending during the pandemic. Lowe's shares increased 3% Wednesday.</p><p>LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT INC.</p><p>LYV -2.9%</p><p>Live Nation's Ticketmaster is trying to shake off a Taylor Swift ticket fiasco. The pop star canceled her planned \"Eras Tour\" public ticket sale after historic demand during the presale period overwhelmed Ticketmaster's system and left few available seats. Hopeful buyers faced glitches and delays, waiting in long virtual queues, getting kicked off the site and receiving error messages. With seat prices ranging from $49 to $449 -- and some VIP packages reaching $899 -- Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing system frustrated fans as it pushed prices higher. Live Nation shares fell 2.9% Thursday.</p><p>GAP INC.</p><p>GPS +7.6%</p><p>Gap cleaned up nicely. The apparel retailer's efforts to streamline its brand and reduce its inventory resulted in a return to a profit in the latest quarter. The improved performance comes amid a flurry of changes, including a recent deal to sell its apparel on Amazon, cutting ties with Kanye West (who goes by Ye) after his anti-Semitic remarks, and eliminating about 500 corporate jobs. The owner of Old Navy and Banana Republic faces economic uncertainty that has shifted consumer spending habits. Gap shares gained 7.6% Friday.</p>",
