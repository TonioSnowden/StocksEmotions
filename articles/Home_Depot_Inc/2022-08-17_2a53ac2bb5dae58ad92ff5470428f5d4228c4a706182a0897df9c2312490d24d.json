  "title": "Stocks Slip Ahead of Fed Minutes; Investors await potential details about the pace of future interest-rate increases",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have mounted a furious climb in recent weeks as investors reassess expectations that persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming economic slowdown were making corporate shares a bad bet. Through Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 jumped 17% from its June low as investors reshuffled portfolios and scrambled to cover bearish wagers.</p><p>A series of strong earnings reports, as well as data last week showing U.S. inflation eased in July, have spurred much of the recent optimism. Lowe's shares climbed after it reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations, following strong results Tuesday from Walmart and Home Depot. Still, major retailers have reported that rising prices have dragged on discretionary shopping.</p><p>With inflation still a critical concern, investors are split on whether the Fed is likely to slow its pace of rate increases or continue to aggressively tighten its policy stance. In recent days, fed-funds futures, used by traders to place bets on how the Fed will set rates, have implied close to even odds that September will bring another 0.75-percentage-point Fed rate hike, as opposed to a smaller half-percentage-point move. Minutes from the Fed's recent meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, could offer more details about U.S. central bankers' plans.</p><p>\"We're all waiting for the Fed minutes,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. \"Like everyone, I'm scratching my head about whether we are experiencing the comeback of a bull market, or if it is just a bear-market rally.\"</p><p>Higher interest rates reduce the value that many investors' models assign to share prices, so more hawkish signals from the Fed's minutes could pause the stock market's recent rally. And many money managers are still worried that the economy could continue to slow. On Wednesday, retail sales data showed spending at stores, online and in restaurants was flat in July. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected retail spending to climb 0.1%.</p><p>Earnings from Target on Wednesday also presented a cloudy picture of the American consumer. Target's profit fell sharply and the company noted it saw customers cut spending on discretionary items. Still, revenue rose, boosted by strong sales of food and beverage, beauty and household items and more shopper visits. Shares fell 2.2%.</p><p>In commodities, oil prices fell in choppy trading as fears of a global economic slowdown continue to hang over investors. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 0.3% to $92.12 a barrel, extending its declines into a fourth day.</p><p>Yields on government bonds moved higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.888% from 2.822% Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices decline. Meanwhile, the yield on the 2-year note rose to 3.354% from 3.249%, keeping the yield curve inverted. That bond-market signal has historically been considered a key recession predictor.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond jumped 19% as individual investors continued to pile into the stock, hoping to push shares even higher andpunish professionals who have bet against it.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%. The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that consumer prices were 10.1% higher in July than the year before, up from 9.4% in June. Investors sold U.K. government bonds, reflecting expectations that the Bank of England will need to further raise interest rates to tame inflation.</p><p>In Asia, stocks moved higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4% and Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.2%.</p><p>Stocks Slip Ahead of Fed Minutes</p>",
