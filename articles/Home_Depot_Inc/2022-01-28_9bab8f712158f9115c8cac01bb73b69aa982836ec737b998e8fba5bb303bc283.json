  "title": "Business News:  Home Depot Names  Decker Its New CEO  ----  By Denny Jacob",
  "text": "<p>   Home Depot Inc. is tapping its operating chief to succeed Craig Menear as chief executive, as the home-improvement retailer looks to enter its next phase of growth in the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   Ted Decker, who also serves as president, will assume the CEO post March 1, Home Depot said Thursday. Mr. Decker, 58 years old, will also join the board then. Mr. Menear will continue as chairman following the transition. </p><p>   Mr. Decker joined Home Depot in 2000 and has been serving in his current roles since October 2020. He was responsible for global store operations, supply chain and outside sales and service. </p><p>   The chain was an early winner as the pandemic sent ripples through the economy and as the homebound quickly turned to fixer-upper projects. The trends continued as the economy reopened, with the company's quarterly revenue beating expectations for several consecutive quarters. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Josh Beckerman contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
