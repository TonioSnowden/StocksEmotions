  "text": "<p>Sales have improved in May as the weather warmed up, Mr. Ellison said in a statement. The company backed its outlook for the year, even amid an increasingly uncertain macro backdrop.</p><p>Lowe's readout comes a day after Home Depot raised its outlookafter a better than expected start to the year. Home Depot, which has long derived a larger portion of its sales from contractors than Lowe's, also cited the late arrival of spring as an impediment to first-quarter sales. Home Depot still posted an increase in its top line, as an inflation-driven 11.4% rise in spending per shopping trip offset a drop in total transactions for the quarter.</p><p>For the period ended April 29, Lowe's reported a slight increase in profit to $2.33 billion. Per-share earnings rose to $3.51 from $3.21 a year ago due to a reduced share count. Lower operating expenses helped improve profit margin. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting earnings of $3.22 a share.</p><p>Overall revenue fell 3.1% to $23.7 billion, just short of Wall Street expectations of $23.8 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Lowe's shares fell 4.1% in premarket trading. They are down nearly 25% this year.</p><p>Lowe's First-Quarter Sales Drop After Unseasonably Cold April</p>",
