  "title": "Business News:  Calpers to Back Bid  For Berkshire Chairman  ----  By Heather Gillers",
  "text": "<p>   The nation's largest pension fund is planning to vote for a proposal that would unseat Warren Buffett as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. </p><p>   The $470 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, said in a regulatory filing that it would support a proposal by the National Legal and Policy Center that Berkshire Hathaway's board chair be independent. That would disqualify Mr. Buffett, who is the company's chief executive, from holding both positions. </p><p>   Having the same person hold both roles weakens corporate governance, the National Legal and Policy Center said in the shareholder measure published ahead of Berkshire's April 30 shareholder meeting. </p><p>   Berkshire Hathaway's board responded by saying it opposes the measure and believes Mr. Buffett should continue to fill both roles. After he departs, a board member who isn't part of management should become chair, the board said. </p><p>   A representative from Berkshire wasn't available for comment. </p><p>   The measure likely faces long odds. Mr. Buffett alone has a 32% voting interest in Berkshire. Calpers supports re-electing Mr. Buffett to the Berkshire board. </p><p>   Companies are increasingly deciding not to have their chief executives serve as chair, according to consulting firm Spencer Stuart. As of last year, 59% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 had split the chair and chief executive roles, compared with 55% the year before and 41% a decade earlier. </p><p>   The National Legal and Policy Center filed measures arguing that the chair should be an independent member of the board at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Mondelez International Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and Home Depot Inc., said Peter Flaherty, the group's chairman. </p><p>   Calpers, which is a shareholder in all five companies, declined to say specifically whether it would support those proposals. A Calpers spokeswoman said the pension fund generally supports separating the board chair and chief executive roles at all companies in which it owns stock. </p><p>   In addition to the proposal concerning Berkshire Hathaway's board chair position, Calpers co-sponsored a separate proposal asking the company for more information on how it manages climate risk. </p><p></p>",
