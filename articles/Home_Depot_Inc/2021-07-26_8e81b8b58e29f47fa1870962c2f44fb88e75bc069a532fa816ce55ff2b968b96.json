  "text": "<p>   Kentucky is not the first place that you would expect to find a good fencer. It might actually be the last. But when two of the best fencers on Team USA hunkered down there during the pandemic, they had a good reason for picking such a remote outpost of their sport. </p><p>   They weren't just training to be Olympians. They were also training to be doctors. </p><p>   Gerek Meinhardt and Lee Kiefer, who also happen to be husband and wife, spent the first year of their marriage battling with swords on a basement fencing strip they built themselves between hospital rounds and medical-school lectures. </p><p>   Kiefer was in her third year at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, which meant she was waking up at 5 a.m. and going to work during the worst days of the pandemic. She's one of the few people in Tokyo who regrets not being able to spend more time in a hospital around Covid-19 patients. </p><p>   Meinhardt was planning to start his first year at the age of 30 after his fourth Summer Games last year. The Olympics were postponed. Medical school wasn't. By the time he got on a plane oneyear after he expected, his Zoom avatar was a photo of himself in a sparkling white uniform. It's not his fencing jacket. It's his doctor's coat. </p><p>   It was remarkable enough that Kiefer and Meinhardt were both medal contenders despite fencing less and studying more during an Olympic year. </p><p>   But then Kiefer did something that no American woman in this event that dates back to 1924 had ever done: She won the gold medal. When she got the final touch to triumph Sunday over the field's top seed and defending Olympic champion, Kiefer ripped off her mask in celebration and screamed: \"Oh my god!\" She wasn't just the first medical student on the medal stand. She was the country's first medal winner of any kind in the history of women's foil. </p><p>   And she might not even be the top fencer in her own home. Meinhardt comes to the Olympics ranked No. 2 in the world and gets his own shot at individual gold on Monday, while the American team is No. 1 and favored to win the nation's first men's gold medal in more than a century. </p><p>   It goes without much saying that burying themselves in medical textbooks is not exactly a common method of training for Olympians. Their competitors across the globe took a slightly different approach. </p><p>   \"They fence,\" said Keeth Smart, a silver medalist in 2008 and the first American fencer ever ranked No. 1 in the world. \"They eat, breathe and sleep fencing.\" </p><p>   Kiefer and Meinhardt barely had time to sleep. Olympic fencers who are not also in medical school tend to practice five days a week. They were lucky to find two days per week in the fall and winter. </p><p>   But maybe the wildest thing about their dual lives is that they're not even outliers on the U.S. team, as more than 25% of the American individual fencers in Tokyo are in medical school or planning to be soon. Kelley Hurley started virtually during the pandemic. Kat Holmes deferred her acceptance until after the Summer Games. Eliza Stone used the delay to take the MCAT exam and apply to be the next Olympian-physician. </p><p>   Fencers at the Olympics are especially ambitious. But even the Team USA fencers talk about the medical students in Tokyo as if they're watching someone eat soup with a knife. </p><p>   \"I have no idea how they do it,\" said U.S. epee fencer Jake Hoyle. </p><p>   Kiefer and Meinhardt did it by building their own piste in the basement of her parents' home in Kentucky, where fencing is better known as something you buy at The Home Depot. </p><p>   \"It's like Muhammad Ali going to medical school and living in Iowa,\" Smart said. </p><p>   This was always the plan for Kiefer, a pre-med in college who comes from a family of doctors, even as she won four consecutive NCAA titles at Notre Dame and fenced at the Olympics in 2012 and 2016. She contemplated retirement before she decided to sandwich Tokyo between her second and third years of medical school. And her education didn't have to be delayed just because the Olympics were. </p><p>   She used this year of purgatory to complete her rotations in family medicine, internal medicine, OB-GYN, psychiatry and neurology. Next comes her third Olympics. Then pediatrics and surgery. </p><p>   It was unlikely that Meinhardt would be in medical school at the same time as her. Once the youngest American man ever on the Olympic fencing team, he also went to Notre Dame and left with two NCAA titles, a business major, an MBA and sights on an entirely different line of work. When he went to Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Meinhardt had a full-time job as a Deloitte consultant. By the time he and Kiefer married in 2019 -- an occasion known in their world as the Royal Fencing Wedding -- his mind was set on medical school. </p><p>   But first he had to go back to college and take the courses he had skipped when he thought his future was in business. </p><p>   \"I didn't have any science classes,\" Meinhardt said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Andrew Beaton contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
