  "text": "<p>   HOUSTON -- As Henry Nguyen reopened his hair salon in southwest Houston, half a dozen neighbors rushed in -- not for haircuts, but to wash their hair. They had gone days without running water at home. </p><p>   The winter freeze that cut power and water across much of America's fourth-largest city had forced Mr. Nguyen to close his salon for four days as he scrambled to protect his home water pipes, wrestled with a lifeless generator and sent his three children to a friend's house to escape the relentless cold. In the three decades since his arrival from Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen had only ever worried about heat and hurricanes in Houston. </p><p>   \"I wasn't scared about winter, but now I know,\" Mr. Nguyen said. \"The ice storm took down the whole state.\" </p><p>   The hair stylist was among many residents and business owners emerging on Saturday to survey damage and begin returning to their normal routines following the fiercest winter storm to hit the city in decades. Around 4 million customers were out of power across Texas during the worst of the storm last week. On Saturday, that figure was down to less than 50,000, according to PowerOutage.US data. Access to safe drinking water remained a critical issue for millions in the state, after freezing temperatures caused pipes to burst and cities, including Houston were placed under boil water notices. </p><p>   Mr. Nguyen was cutting hair again as cars darted along roads cleared of ice. The weather had turned warmer. Foot traffic resurfaced along the main thoroughfare of Sharpstown, the diverse neighborhood where Hair By Henry opened 19 years ago. </p><p>   In the storm's aftermath, many were still struggling to secure water and searching for food even as power was restored. Early Saturday morning, dozens waited outside the doors of a Home Depot in southwest Houston, where a sign hung warning that the store didn't have generators, firewood, gas heaters or charcoal, among other items. A sign at a crowded 85C Bakery Cafe said it couldn't serve customers drinks because of the city's water issues. </p><p>   Jack Chau, co-owner of Vietnamese eatery Vi's Sandwiches at the Hong Kong Food Market, estimated he and his mother had prepared and given out roughly 200 free banh mi sandwiches to families unable to get food elsewhere. They had offered the free meals for two hours. </p><p>   \"We ran out of sandwiches,\" said Mr. Chau, 27. \"We didn't expect that many people.\" </p><p>   The storm delayed shipments of Covid-19 vaccines in Texas and other states. The Houston Methodist hospital system last week had received only half its expected shipment of 30,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines. But vaccination appointments were returning to a normal pace and may be sped up in coming days to make up for the delay, spokeswoman Stefanie Asin said Saturday. </p><p>   Deya Rojas, manager of VVS Car Wash &amp; Detail in southwest Houston, said her family's business lost roughly $7,000 as the storm forced the carwash to shut down. When a pipe burst, Ms. Rojas's family couldn't find plumbers to repair it and local department stores had run out of PVC pipe. Her family fixed the pipe with a hose, and was finally able to return to washing cars on Saturday. </p><p>   \"It worked out,\" she said, as cars lined up to get sprayed. </p><p>   The storm had cost Buchanan's Native Plants around $50,000 in lost plants and days of closure last week, and the icy weather had busted a few pipes. David Alvarado, a manager at the garden center, said staff scrambled to move some vulnerable plants indoors and put some in frost cloth to protect plants from freezing temperatures. The below-freezing temperatures killed many of those, as well. </p><p>   But customers were winding around the garden center Saturday, and Mr. Alvarado said he expects customers to pounce on the opportunity to refurbish their gardens after the storm. </p><p></p>",
