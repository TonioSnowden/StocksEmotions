  "title": "Biden Administration's Student-Loan Relief Faces Mounting Legal Hurdles; White House has to overcome growing court roadblocks to resume student-debt cancellation efforts",
  "text": "<p>The St. Louis-based Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals already had placed the program on hold in a temporary order last month, in a case brought by Republican officials in six states. An additional ruling from that court is expected in the coming days.</p><p>On Wednesday, before the debt-relief plan was struck down, Mr. Biden singled out the issue as a top one that motivated young voters to turn out for the midterms in \"historic numbers.\"</p><p>\"We will continue to keep borrowers informed about our efforts to deliver targeted relief,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement Friday. \"Separately, we remain committed to taking other actions to fix longstanding issues in the student loan forgiveness system and hold schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs.\"</p><p>Biden administration officials have been quietly preparing for the possibility that a court would strike down the program, according to administration officials, and have been discussing both legal and policy responses to such a move.</p><p>In particular, it remains unclear whether the administration will seek to extend the pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments. Interest has been frozen and payments have been suspended since March 2020, but the administration was planning to end the pause as of Jan. 1.</p><p>An online petition from the Student Debt Crisis Center, a borrower-support organization, had accrued more than 20,000 signatures as of late Friday morning asking Mr. Biden to extend the pause until all roadblocks to receiving debt relief have been removed.</p><p>The Biden debt-cancellation plan would forgive up to $10,000 for federal student-loan borrowers who make under $125,000 a year, or $250,000 for married couples. Pell Grant recipients would qualify for an additional $10,000 in relief.</p><p>Thursday's ruling from U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman called the Biden administration's plan an \"unconstitutional exercise of Congress's legislative power\" and said that borrowers hadn't been able to weigh in on the merits of the program through a rule-making process. The lawsuit was supported by the Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative group founded by Home Depot Inc. co-founder Bernie Marcus.</p><p>The Education Department said it was ready to immediately move to forgive debt for 16 million borrowers whose applications for relief have already been processed, \"when allowed by the courts.\"</p><p>Some debt relief proponents faulted the administration for not moving to automatically cancel debt, rather than giving opponents of the program time to formulate legal challenges. Legal scholars are split on whether borrowers could see their debt balances restored if they were forgiven as part of a program that is ultimately ruled unconstitutional.</p><p>Several lawsuits have been filed in courts around the country challenging the student-debt program. Until Thursday, none had any success in attacking the program's legality. The Republican-led case pending at the Eighth Circuit focused on the preliminary issue of whether GOP leaders have standing to challenge the debt-relief on behalf of their six states. A U.S. District Court judge in St. Louis who originally considered that question said they didn't.</p><p>Separately, the Supreme Court already has turned down two long-shot requests to block the administration's plans.</p><p>WSJ Guide to Student Loans</p><p>Read more about navigating the myths and misunderstandings about college debt</p><p>https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/the-wsj-guide-to-student-loans.pdf</p><p>PHOTO: John Nichols/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The legal wrangling comes as the administration is working to overhaul the federal student-loan system. This year, the Education Department has released many regulations and proposed rules to make it easier for different groups of borrowers to pay off some of their debts and have the rest forgiven.</p><p>Budget analysts have said the more generous terms of income-driven repayment programs could cost nearly $500 billion and transform federal student loans into something resembling more of a grant-based program.</p><p>Those efforts have yielded tens of billions of dollars in canceled debt so far, including the resolution of millions of borrower claims against defunct for-profit institutions such as Corinthian Colleges.</p><p>The mass debt-cancellation plan is likely to come under closer scrutiny if Republicans capture the House of Representatives once midterm election vote-counting concludes. GOP lawmakers have criticized congressional Democrats for not holding oversight hearings on the administration's plan.</p><p>\"This radical scheme must be eviscerated entirely,\" Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, said after Thursday's ruling.</p><p>Write to Gabriel T.
