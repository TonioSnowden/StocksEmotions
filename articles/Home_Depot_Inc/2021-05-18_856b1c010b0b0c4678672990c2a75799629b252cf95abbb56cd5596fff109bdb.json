  "text": "<p>Retailers offered a rosy picture on the health of the US consumer on Tuesday after reporting strong quarterly sales, as people armed with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d28acdd8-b6ea-4a49-a9f2-30fc5895d0f7\">government stimulus cheques </a>hit the shops in person and online. &#xa0;</p> <p>Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, boosted its financial outlook for the remainder of the year after recording the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41f8d142-5bb3-4841-a469-38d4a0539c90\">strongest first-quarter sales</a> in its history. It said its customers were stocking up on groceries, apparel, household items and garden supplies.</p> <p>Department store Macy's also raised its annual guidance, saying sales trends improved throughout the first quarter as the economic recovery gained steam.</p> <p>And at Home Depot, the DIY chain, a pandemic-fuelled boom in home improvement projects continued to drive demand for lumber and tools, also lifting the company to record first-quarter revenues.</p> <p>The results signalled that more shoppers are returning to stores even as inflation pushed up prices and Covid-19 vaccinations prompted more spending on travel and other leisure activities.</p> <p>Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, said every business segment performed well in the latest quarter with store traffic rising and its US ecommerce sales up 37 per cent.</p> <p>While stimulus payments in the US created a tailwind, “we also see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop”, McMillon told analysts on an earnings call, adding that the second quarter was also turning out stronger than expected. “My optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year,” he said.</p> <p>Walmart's total revenue rose 2.7 per cent year on year to $138bn for the three months to the end of April, beating analysts' forecasts of $132bn. Comparable sales at Walmart's US stores jumped 6 per cent excluding fuel, above estimates for a gain of 0.8 per cent, as the company gained market share in groceries.</p> <p>Walmart now expects net sales growth this year to be in the low- to mid-single digits on a percentage basis, excluding disposals. It previously estimated that there would be a low-single digit increase.</p> <p>Big-box stores have performed well in the past year, particularly those that offer a broad range of goods that appealed to consumers looking for one-stop shopping during the pandemic.</p> <p>Craig Menear, Home Depot's chief executive, called the demand for home improvement projects “unprecedented”. His company generated $37.5bn in first-quarter sales, up 32.7 per cent year on year and beating analysts' forecast for $35bn.</p> <p>Same-store sales grew faster than they did during the previous quarter, jumping 31 per cent compared with a 24.5 per cent gain in the Thanksgiving and Christmas festive period.</p> <p>Analysts had expected sales growth to slow. Yet Home Depot rung up 19 per cent more transactions than the year-ago quarter, and the average customer spend grew 10 per cent to $82.37.</p> <p>Macy's said demand remained strong across the home, jewellery, fragrance and luxury categories, while customers showed more interest in special occasion items as they begin to travel more.</p> <p>Comparable sales including licensed departments swung 64 per cent higher from last year, when revenues were slashed by the temporary closure of Macy's stores at the height of pandemic. They were 10 per cent below the equivalent level in 2019, however.</p> <p>Overall revenues grew by more than half to $4.7bn, surpassing Wall Street' estimate of $4.4bn.</p> <p>Macy's stores “continue to show signs of recovery earlier than expected”, chief executive Jeff Gennette said. “In states with stronger vaccine rollouts and in areas where restrictions have loosened, we're seeing a corresponding increase in foot traffic.”</p> <p>Macy's forecast up to $22.2bn in net sales in 2021, up from previous guidance of about $20.8bn. The company more than doubled its earnings outlook.</p><p>Source: Matthew Rocco 2021 'US retailers boost forecasts as customers go on shopping spree ' FT.com 18 May.
