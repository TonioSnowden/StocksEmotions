  "text": "<p>A lender that once wanted to take business from banks is embracing the banking business. SoFi said Tuesday it had an agreement to buy banking-software maker Technisys SA for about $1.1 billion, an all-stock deal equivalent to roughly 10% of SoFi's market value. It gives SoFi control of the back-end technology that banks use to power mobile-banking apps, open accounts and track customer deposits. The deal follows SoFi's acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc., part of a push to expand beyond the company's origins as a student lender. SoFi shares shed 9.9% Tuesday.</p><p>CARVANA CO.</p><p>CVNA +11%</p><p>Carvana hopes a new acquisition will rev up sales. The online auto dealer on Thursday said it would buy used-car auction business ADESA U.S. for $2.2 billion, which will help Carvana boost the number of cars it can sell. The startup posted a quarterly loss and a slowdown in sales growth as the benefits of rising used-car prices and low interest rates start to fade. Carvana said that rising short-term interest rates, the impact of the Omicron variant and winter storms would be a drag on the company's business in the first few months of 2022. Carvana shares gained 11% Thursday.</p><p>LOWE'S COS.</p><p>LOW +0.2%</p><p>The foundation under the home-improvement industry is shifting. Lowe's said its sales growth will ease this year but projected that its profitability will improve, a day after its larger competitor Home Depot Inc. gave a similar sales outlook for 2022. Their guidance signals a new phase for the retailers after Covid-19 lockdowns fueled surging demand for DIY and remodeling projects. Lowe's shares added 0.2% Wednesday.</p><p>WAYFAIR INC.</p><p>W +4.7%</p><p>Wayfair is adjusting to a world where its customers are no longer couchbound. Wayfair said fourth-quarter revenue fell more than 11% from a year earlier, as more people returned to physical stores for furniture shopping. The online furniture seller added millions of customers in 2020 as pandemic-related lockdowns kept shoppers indoors and focused on sprucing up their homes. The company said its active customers, which include any shopper who placed an order within the past 12 months, in 2021 fell roughly 13% to 27.3 million. Wayfair shares rose 4.7% Thursday.</p><p>MODERNA INC.</p><p>MRNA +15%</p><p>Vaccine sales gave Moderna's bottom line another shot in the arm. The vaccine maker saw better-than-expected profits for the last three months of 2021, fueled by sales of its Covid-19 shot. In the latest quarter, Moderna's revenue reached $7.21 billion, nearly all coming from vaccine sales. The company said it distributed 807 million doses of the shot, Spikevax, last year. For all of 2021, Moderna posted revenue of $18.5 billion, almost all from sales of the shot. Meanwhile, the company is testing potential approaches for a fall booster shot. Moderna shares surged 15% Thursday.</p><p>ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV SA</p><p>BUD -1%</p><p>The fizz is returning to Anheuser-Busch InBev. The world's largest beer company on Thursday reported higher fourth-quarter sales, buoyed by drinkers returning to bars and reaching for pricier beers. The Budweiser brewer said products that it classifies as premium and superpremium, which include Michelob Ultra Pure Gold and Goose Island, now account for about a third of its revenue. The brewer has been grappling with the challenges of the last few years, as U.S. drinkers defected away from mainstream beer brands. American depositary shares of AB InBev lost 1% Thursday.</p><p>OWENS CORNING</p><p>OC +2.3%</p><p>U.S. companies are bracing for the aftershocks of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Buildings-materials maker Owens Corning will look for alternative gas sources in other countries if Russian suppliers reduce deliveries. Owens Corning sources natural gas from several distributors in Russia and other European countries. Meanwhile, food-processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. halted operations at its facilities in Ukraine and cash-management firm Brink's Co. stopped all operations in Russia. Owens Corning shares increased 2.3% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
