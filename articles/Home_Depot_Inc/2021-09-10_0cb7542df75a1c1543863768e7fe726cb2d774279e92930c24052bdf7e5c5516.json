  "title": "UPS to Buy Delivery Platform Roadie; Deal thrusts UPS into same-day delivery market; Roadie has network of 200,000 crowdsourced drivers",
  "text": "<p>UPS has been looking for ways to crack into the same-day delivery market amid the growth of e-commerce and demand for even quicker deliveries. Delivery platforms like DoorDash Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have offered such services, while retailers like Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. also have been building out same-day delivery capabilities.</p><p>Buying Roadie thrusts UPS directly into the space, while addressing some of the limitations of using its own network for certain packages. UPS said that Roadie drivers can deliver items that don't fit because of their size or because they are perishable. They can also deliver items that are in shopping bags.</p><p>Roadie's network of crowdsourced drivers use their own vehicles to complete deliveries. The company says that it has 200,000 drivers that deliver items all across the country, including for retailers like Michael's Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc.</p><p>Marc Gorlin started Roadie in 2014 after he needed tiles quickly transported from Alabama to his condo in Florida. He realized that there was likely someone already driving that route who would consider delivering the items for a fee.</p><p>\"What would happen if we unlocked all of that wasted space?,\" Mr. Gorlin said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last year.</p><p>The company had raised funding from Home Depot Inc. and other investors. Mr. Gorlin said that the pandemic helped Roadie sign on more retailers who quickly needed to find a way to get orders to shoppers who were avoiding stores.</p><p>Roadie will continue to operate under its own name. Goods transported by Roadie won't cross into the UPS network, and goods shipped via UPS won't enter the Roadie network, UPS said.</p><p>The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com and Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com</p><p>UPS to Buy Delivery Platform Roadie</p>",
