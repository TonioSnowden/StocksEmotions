  "text": "<p>Stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks on wide-ranging economic, geopolitical and Covid-19 concerns. Weighing most heavily on many investors' minds is the outlook for the U.S. economy as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates to combat inflation.</p><p>On Tuesday, fresh data from the Commerce Department showed some signs of economic resilience, with U.S. shoppers increasing retail spending in April for the fourth consecutive month. That, as well as the reopening of some stores in Shanghai this week after a strict Covid-19 lockdown, provided some sources of optimism.</p><p>Stocks briefly pared gains Tuesday afternoon as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell voiced resolve in fighting inflation, before indexes climbed back toward new session highs. \"There could be some pain involved\" in restoring price stability, Mr. Powell said in remarks at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival.</p><p>Morgan Stanley has a year-end price target of 3900 for the S&amp;P 500, implying that the index still has further to fall.

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines posted big gains.</p><p>Twitter gained 93 cents, or 2.5%, to $38.32, after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said his $44 billion bid for the social-media company can't move forward until the company is clearer about how many of its accounts are fake.</p><p>Twitter has wiped out all the gains it notched after Mr. Musk disclosed a stake in the company in April and is trading well below his deal that values the company at $54.20 a share.</p><p>Walmart slumped $16.86, or 11%, to $131.35 -- retreating to its lowest level in more than a year -- after the retailer reported that earnings fell sharply. Home Depot rose $4.96, or 1.7%, to $300.95 after postingan improved outlook for the year and said shoppers were spending more per shopping trip.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.969% from 2.877% Monday.</p><p>The price of bitcoin rose 0.7% to $30,080.86 at 5 p.m. in New York.</p><p>Brent crude oil, the international energy benchmark, fell 2% to settle at $111.93 a barrel.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 1.2%, its third consecutive winning session.
