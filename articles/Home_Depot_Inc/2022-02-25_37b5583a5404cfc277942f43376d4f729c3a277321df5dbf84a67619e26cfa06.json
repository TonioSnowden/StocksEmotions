  "text": "<p>   Wayfair Inc. is grappling not only with inflation denting consumers' spending power, but also people shifting purchases to physical stores as Covid-19 restrictions ease. </p><p>   During the first year of the pandemic, the online furniture seller enjoyed a captive audience, as lockdowns kept shoppers indoors and focused on sprucing up their homes. It added millions of customers in 2020, and posted its first annual profit as a public company. </p><p>   Wayfair's growth last year didn't keep pace with 2020. The company on Thursday reported a quarterly loss for the second consecutive quarter, and said fourth-quarter revenue fell more than 11% from a year earlier to $3.25 billion, a figure slightly below forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>   Active customers in 2021 fell roughly 13% to 27.3 million. Wayfair measures active customers as any shopper who placed an order within the past 12 months. </p><p>   \"Although household savings remain robust, our customers are seeing widespread inflation impact their lives and pressure their wallets,\" Michael Fleisher, Wayfair's chief financial officer, told analysts. \"They also have more choices around where to direct their dollars as pandemic restrictions ease.\" </p><p>   Wayfair was one of several large retailers that benefited from the dramatic shift in America's spending habits during the pandemic, when companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Home Depot Inc., posted soaring quarterly sales and profits. Executives said they remained confident in the growth of the home-goods category but noted that the direction of the larger economy remains difficult to predict. </p><p>   Wayfair shares closed Thursday up nearly 5% at $127.07 in a roller-coaster session. Shares opened the day 17% lower than Wednesday's close after the company reported a steeper-than-expected loss of $202 million, or $1.92 a share, in the quarter featuring the key holiday shopping season. The company's share price has fallen 51% over the past 12 months. </p><p></p>",
