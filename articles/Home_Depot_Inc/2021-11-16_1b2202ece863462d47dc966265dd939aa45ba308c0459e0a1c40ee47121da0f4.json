  "title": "Home Depot Sales Rise, Continuing Pandemic Streak; Home-improvement retailer posts quarterly earnings of $4.13 billion, despite supply-chain challenges",
  "text": "<p>Home Depot shares rose 5.7% on Tuesday to close at $392.33, a record-high finish. The stock has gained 48% year to date.</p><p>As the economy lurches into gear after last year's downturn, businesses have had to pay more for raw materials. They have also endured much longer delivery times amid backlogs at U.S. ports, a squeeze in shipping capacity and difficulties finding workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Craig Menear said the company's approach to managing its inventory gives it flexibility as it faces those issues.</p><p>At stores that have been open for at least a year, Home Depot's sales rose 6.1% for August through October, including by 5.5% at stores in the U.S. That trend built upon strong growth a year earlier, when the pandemic began driving people to invest more in their homes. Home Depot's total sales in the quarter increased 9.8% year over year to $36.82 billion, and were more than a third higher than in the same stretch of 2019, before Covid-19 emerged.</p><p>As retailers struggle to find workers and move goods through world-wide logistics networks, many have had to think fast to ensure shelves remain well-stocked. Home Depot is among the major U.S. retailers that have chartered their own container ships in recent months to move goods from overseas.</p><p>Still, Home Depot hasn't been fully immune to transportation challenges and higher costs, the company's executives said. They said Home Depot is working with suppliers and, in some cases, introducing alternative products to keep shelves full.</p><p>In the face of those hurdles, the company's gross margin, a measure of its profitability, declined slightly year over year. Richard McPhail, Home Depot's finance chief, said higher transportation expenses and a less favorable mix of products sold were the top factors that led to that decline.</p><p>Though sales grew year over year in the latest quarter, Home Depot's pace of growth has slowed since earlier in the pandemic. Between April 2020 and April 2021 it recorded four straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth. As people spent more time at home—and as bank accounts swelled with government stimulus checks—consumers' appetite for home-improvement projects strengthened.</p><p>The most recent quarter's biggest year-over-year sales gain occurred in October, the company said. Sales have also been strong so far this quarter, Mr. McPhail told analysts. Ted Decker, the company's president, attributed that trend in part to falling lumber prices, which have made some projects more affordable.</p><p>Those data suggest consumer demand isn't slowing heading into the holiday-shopping season. As sales growth continues, it is starting to look as if the pandemic has prompted a lasting increase in home-improvement demand, not a one-time bump, Neuberger Berman analyst John San Marco said.</p><p>\"Each quarter that passes in the Covid era is further evidence that Covid has been a step function higher for the business, rather than a pull forward of demand,\" Mr. San Marco said.</p><p>Home Depot's sales growth is in accord with other big retailers' sustained momentum.</p><p>Walmart Inc. on Tuesday notched quarterly comparable sales that were 9.2% higher year over year. Walmart raised its full-year profit guidance and said it expects strong results through the holiday season.</p><p>Advance Auto Parts Inc. raised its full-year sales guidance this week too, forecasting same-store sales growth of 9.5% to 10%.</p><p>Home Depot's sales growth boosted its bottom line, pushing profit higher. The company logged quarterly earnings of $4.13 billion, or $3.92 a share, compared with $3.43 billion, or $3.18 a share, in 2020's third quarter.</p><p>Wall Street analysts polled by FactSet had forecast earnings of $3.35 a share, and sales of $34.95 billion.</p><p>Home Depot's consistent profitability has demonstrated a strong ability to manage costs, Mr. San Marco said. \"If that was ever going to be tested, it was going to be now when commodity costs are swinging pretty violently,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Home Depot Sales Rise, Continuing Pandemic Streak</p>",
