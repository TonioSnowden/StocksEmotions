  "text": "<p>Home Depot said Tuesday that it now expects revenue to rise 3% after a strong start to the year. The new view came after a warning in February that sales would only rise slightly. It lifted its profit forecast too, with per-share earnings now expected to rise at a mid-single digit rate.</p><p>The retailer was a major beneficiary during much of the pandemic. At one point during the last two years, Home Depot posted four straight quarters of comparable sales growth above 20% as the public-health crisis's social disruptions left people spending more time in their houses.</p><p>It is now confronting a slowdown from that high, as well as rising inflation and continued supply-chain disruptions.</p><p>For the three months ended May 1, Home Depot posted earnings of $4.2 billion, or $4.09 a share, compared with $4.1 billion, or $3.86 a share, in the first quarter of last year. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $3.71 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>First-quarter sales came in at $38.9 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $36.7 billion.</p><p>Shares of Home Depot, down nearly 29% so far this year, rose 4% in premarket trading.</p><p>Home Depot Raises Outlook as Fewer Customers Spend More</p>",
