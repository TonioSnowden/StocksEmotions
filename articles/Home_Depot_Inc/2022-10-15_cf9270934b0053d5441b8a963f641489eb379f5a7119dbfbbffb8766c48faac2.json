  "text": "<p>HAPPY SACKS</p><p>Ms. Garcia was pleasantly surprised to find Home Depot's metal lantern set, a nostalgic riff on paper shopping bags that hauled kids' Halloween loot before plastic jack-o-lantern buckets relegated them to obscurity. \"I think the reinterpretation is an elegant design,\" she said. A tea light placed inside will reflect the orange interior through cutouts of \"Trick or Treat\" and \"Boo\" in the matte-black surfaces. Metal Halloween Trick or Treat Bucket, Set of Two, $29, HomeDepot.com</p><p>PICK OF THE PATCH</p><p>\"Halloween decor all tends to look the same,\" lamented Ms. Garcia, which is why this pumpkin dish in the latest Birch Lane catalog captured her attention. \"The burnt orange hue in combination with the shiny gold hardware is subtle but still eye-catching,\" she said. Crafted from durable cast-iron, the piece weighs in at 15 pounds, so it \"won't tip over or spill easily,\" added Ms. Garcia. Cast Iron 5.49-quart Pumpkin Cocotte, $500, BirchLane.com</p><p>STRANGE HELLO</p><p>Pier 1 pushed a simple concept, a 42-inch wooden sign, into clever territory, says Ms. Garcia, by framing its message in creepy webs and adding a dangling, eight-legged tenant. Like magic, warm-white LED lights powered by two AA batteries, (not included) illuminate the \"Boo\" and give the message dimension beyond the high contrast of the black typeface against traffic-cone orange. Lighted Wooden Porch Sign, $71, Pier1.com</p>",
