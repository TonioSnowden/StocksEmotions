  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Design & Decorating -- Catalog Curation:  A Guide to Spooky Chic  ---  We tasked Mexican designer Aranza Garcia with sifting through the latest seasonal offerings from  four mass-market retailers to find the best Halloween-inspired decor. Here, her spirited selections.  ----  By Allison Duncan",
  "text": "<p>\n  SCARY SERVERS </p><p>\n  Mexico's Day of the Dead festivities share some of American Halloween's playfully morbid iconography (festooned skulls and Mariachi skeletons, for example) but the multiday commemoration is \"more of a religious experience,\" said Aranza Garcia, our curator and co-founder of Chuch Estudio in Merida, Yucatan. For a party, Ms. Garcia would bring in this handy take on a footed bowl, whose witchy talons and bangled wrists are both \"fun and sexy.\" The creepy clutches and supporting \"books\" of resin-stone composite serve up removable glass bowls. Witch Hands Snack Bowl Stand, $229, GrandinRoad.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  HAPPY SACKS </p><p>\n  Ms. Garcia was pleasantly surprised to find Home Depot's metal lantern set, a nostalgic riff on paper shopping bags that hauled kids' Halloween loot before plastic jack-o-lantern buckets relegated them to obscurity. \"I think the reinterpretation is an elegant design,\" she said. A tea light placed inside will reflect the orange interior through cutouts of \"Trick or Treat\" and \"Boo\" in the matte-black surfaces. Metal Halloween Trick or Treat Bucket, Set of Two, $29, HomeDepot.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  PICK OF THE PATCH </p><p>\n  \"Halloween decor all tends to look the same,\" lamented Ms. Garcia, which is why this pumpkin dish in the latest Birch Lane catalog captured her attention. \"The burnt orange hue in combination with the shiny gold hardware is subtle but still eye-catching,\" she said. Crafted from durable cast-iron, the piece weighs in at 15 pounds, so it \"won't tip over or spill easily,\" added Ms. Garcia. Cast Iron 5.49-quart Pumpkin Cocotte, $500, BirchLane.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  STRANGE HELLO </p><p>\n  Pier 1 pushed a simple concept, a 42-inch wooden sign, into clever territory, says Ms. Garcia, by framing its message in creepy webs and adding a dangling, eight-legged tenant. Like magic, warm-white LED lights powered by two AA batteries, (not included) illuminate the \"Boo\" and give the message dimension beyond the high contrast of the black typeface against traffic-cone orange. Lighted Wooden Porch Sign, $71, Pier1.com </p><p></p>",
