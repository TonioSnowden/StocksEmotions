  "title": "Lowe's Posts Higher Quarterly Sales as Home Spending Holds Up; Home-improvement chain pays out bonuses, raises wages for front-line workers",
  "text": "<p>Lowe's on Wednesday also said that it was giving out $200 million in bonuses to front-line hourly workers, and $170 million in permanent wage increases. Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said the pay increases were enabled by cost management that improved adjusted operating margin.</p><p>The results come after rival Home Depot Inc. said Tuesday that quarterly sales rose 5.6%, lifted by fewer but higher-dollar transactions. Home Depot said its results got a boost from big-ticket transactions, or ones worth more than $1,000, which were up 10% from a year earlier.</p><p>Both Home Depot and Lowe's benefited from a surge in spending on home-improvement projects early in the pandemic as Americans invested in their houses. In recent quarters, though, widespread inflation and rising mortgage rates have sparked fears that the sector could be in for a slowdown.</p><p>In its latest quarter ended Oct. 28, Lowe's said same-store sales, which strips out effects from store openings and closings, rose 2.2% in the third quarter. In the U.S., the figure increased 3%.</p><p>Revenue rose more than 2% to $23.48 billion, beating expectations.</p><p>Lowe's posted a profit of $154 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $1.90 billion, or $2.73 a share, in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Stripping out a $2.1 billion impairment charge tied to the sale of Lowe's Canadian retail business, adjusted earnings came to $3.27 a share, topping the $3.09 a share expected by Wall Street.</p><p>The company also raised its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $13.65 a share to $13.80 a share, excluding the effect from the sale of the Canadian business. The company had previously guided for full-year earnings of $13.10 a share to $13.60 a share.</p><p>Sales are expected to be between $97 billion and $98 billion. Lowe's in August said it expected full-year sales toward the bottom end of its range of $97 billion to $99 billion. The company also said it expected to buy back about $13 billion worth of shares this year, up from $12 billion expected in August.</p><p>Shares of Lowe's rose almost 3% to $215 a share in premarket trading.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Lowe's Posts Higher Quarterly Sales as Home Spending Holds Up</p>",
