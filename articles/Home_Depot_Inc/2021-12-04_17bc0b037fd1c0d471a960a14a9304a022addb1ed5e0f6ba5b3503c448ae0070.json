  "text": "<p>The thefts mark an increase in intensity because of the size of the groups and the organized nature of the crimes, said some retail and security executives. During the Nordstrom theft, dozens of people arrived at the store in cars at the same time, rushed inside to cause chaos and steal items. The police made a handful of arrests.</p><p>\"We do see flash mobs with some level of regularity, said Scott Glenn, vice president of asset protection for Home Depot Inc.</p><p>Retail and security executives said those events are part of a sharp rise in organized retail theft since the Covid-19 pandemic began, in part because e-commerce growth has led to more demand for underpriced goods online.</p><p>The National Retail Federation estimates that organized retail crime, a distinct category from shoplifting overall, costs retailers an average of $700,000 per $1 billion in sales.Stolen goods such as power tools, medicine and pricey handbags are often resold anonymously through Amazon.com, Facebook Marketplace and other platforms, these executives said.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Meta Platforms Inc. said Facebook prohibits selling stolen items. Amazon.com doesn't allow sellers to list stolen goods, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>At Home Depot, theft apprehensions, are up about 10% year-over-year, a spokeswoman said. The home-improvement retailer is hiring more security and changing the layout of entrances to prevent theft, said Mr. Glenn. Recently the company started adding technology that makes a product inoperable until it is checked out at a register, he said.</p><p>A group of district attorneys in Northern California recently said they would each be detailing a prosecutor from their offices to work together on stopping the thefts. \"These are clearly carefully orchestrated crimes, working together in large groups to create a mob-like mentality,\" said Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley in a statement.</p><p>After two businesses in the city of Alameda, Calif., were targeted in November, the police department advised local businesses to take special precautions, including installing a shatterproof film over store windows, adding motion sensor cameras, and removing high-value items from store floors.</p><p>The California Highway Patrol said that it would start increasing patrols on freeway corridors near major shopping centers. And Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody on Thursday announced a task force to specifically target organized retail theft.</p><p>In 2011, the National Retail Federation said that flash-mob attacks were reported by 10% of the 106 retailers it surveyed. Around 69% of retailers reported a rise in organized retail crime in 2020, according to an NRF survey this year with 41 responses.</p><p>Retailers are employing a bigger security presence, said Ben Dugan, director of organized retail crime at CVS Health Corp. and president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail, a group that facilitates planning between retailers and law enforcement.</p><p>CVS has doubled the size of its corporate staff working on organized retail crime this year compared with last, he said. Longer term, the drugstore chain is working with local law-enforcement officials in several states to coordinate theft response, as well as supporting federal legislation that retailers hope will make reselling of stolen goods online more difficult, said Mr. Dugan.</p><p>Retail theft, particularly by organized groups, is rising at Best Buy Co. and is eating into the company's profits, said Chief Executive Corie Barry on a call to discuss earnings last month.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
