  "text": "<p>As the editorial board highlights in \"The 2020 Murder Spike\" (Sept. 29), 2020 was a record-poor year for U.S. violent crime. Astute readers should be aware that the problem has not abated. Violent crime remains high as the criminal-justice system struggles to keep up. . . .</p><p>The jump reflects a criminal-justice system still struggling to recover from the dual blow of Covid and antipolice sentiment. Jail populations are still well below where they were in February of last year; the precipitous decline has released thousands of criminals, including repeat offenders, onto our streets. Some courts are not yet running at full capacity. Big-city police departments like Minneapolis's are still straining to meet staffing minimums. . . .</p><p>Charles Fain Lehman</p><p>Manhattan Institute</p><p>Rockville, Md.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>Teachers Against Politicizing the Classroom | Oct. 8</p><p>Regarding \"A Brawl Over Schools In Virginia\" (Review &amp; Outlook, Oct. 1): The votes of teachers as well as parents may be in play over these issues in schools. Under the current Democratic administration, the Virginia Department of Education has done much to politicize education. . . .</p><p>Such exercises are pseudoacademic, puerile and transparently manipulative. Yet this seems to be the new modus operandi for Virginia Democrats in shaping education policy. I have had many conversations with colleagues, including some liberal ones, who are gravely concerned about this trend. . . .</p><p>Dennis Moore</p><p>Cloverdale, Va.</p><p>Mr. Moore teaches social studies at Rockbridge County High School.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>Covid, AIDS and the Dismal Science of Public Health | Oct. 8</p><p>John Tierney's \"Unlearned AIDS Lessons for Covid\" (op-ed, Oct. 4) correctly stresses the public-health community's history of overforecasting diseases. But the lack of expertise in the economic incentives that limit disease is much broader, as Richard Posner and I argued three decades ago. Since then, the field of economic epidemiology has exploded, and Covid-19 represents many déjà vu experiences of its main lessons.</p><p>First, the course of communicable diseases is driven more by incentives in the private sector than by government policy. . . .</p><p>Prof. Tomas J. Philipson</p><p>University of Chicago</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>Gender Ideology Has a Problem With Women | Oct. 9</p><p>Nicole Ault's op-ed \"The ACLU Decides 'Woman' Is a Bad Word\" (Oct. 4) is an excellent riposte to the latest attempt to gerrymander reality via politically driven manipulation of the English language. . . .</p><p>In a world where anyone can be whoever or whatever they feel, it is inevitable that some identities will stand in insufferable contradiction to others—the conservative Christian to that of the queer activist, for example. If society is to be at all coherent, this means that somebody is going to have to decide which identities are privileged and which are not.</p><p>The candidates for the role of arbiter are obvious: formally, the government, and, informally, Big Tech and the entertainment industry, influenced by the most active and culturally savvy lobby groups. On that score, the ACLU would seem to be in the vanguard, once again blithely highlighting the increasingly tragicomic irony of its name.</p><p>Prof. Carl R. Trueman</p><p>Grove City College</p><p>Grove City, Pa.</p><p>I laud J.K. Rowling and other \"gender-critical\" figures for attempting to draw lines. But to make real progress, they should take a hard look at feminism's role in gender-identity ideology. Until we examine and rethink the logic that led us here, self-described feminists will continue to erase women.</p><p>Ramona Tausz</p><p>Deputy editor, First Things</p><p>New York</p><p>Supposedly biology does not determine gender; you are a woman if you feel like a woman. But what does it mean to feel like a woman? That you like to wear skirts and makeup? Many women don't feel that way. Are you a man if you like rough sports? Many men don't like them, and some women do like them. . . .</p><p>But if neither biology nor attitudes define one as a woman or man, the distinction must be meaningless, and the label \"man\" or \"woman\" arbitrary and capricious. Yet it is also insisted that gender is of crucial importance. You can be punished for failing to address people by their preferred pronouns. This ideology is incoherent.</p><p>George W. Dent Jr.</p><p>Solon, Ohio</p><p>Read the full letters here.</p><p>A Tax Refugee From New Jersey | Oct. 12</p><p>I could not contain a smug chuckle when I read \"The Taxing Governor Says No More\" (Review &amp; Outlook, Oct. 1). Long before Gov. Phil Murphy took office, my wife and I fled New Jersey and its rapacious taxes. . . .</p><p>Donald Gallo</p><p>Golden, Colo.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>School-Board Fights, Democracy and the FBI | Oct. 15</p><p>In \"Merrick Garland's Federal Offense\" (Oct. 7), the editorial board questions the attorney general's intervention into local school-board meetings to investigate what the National School Boards Association describes as parental activity akin \"to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.\" But there's a broader story here. . . .</p><p>One way to ensure school-board decisions are more responsive to local constituents' preferences—and foster the cherished spirit of localism that underpins a healthy democracy—is to elect school boards on-cycle, in November of even years, at the same time regular state and federal elections take place. . . .</p><p>Michael Hartney</p><p>Brookline, Mass.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>The Art Institute of Chicago's Loss—and Ours | Oct. 20</p><p>Regarding Faith Bottum's op-ed \"Indocency on Display at the Art Institute of Chicago\" (Oct. 16): The foolish and shortsighted firing of volunteer docents at the Art Institute of Chicago will destroy decades of enlightened outreach to the public-school children of this major city. I know this because I owe my entire career as an art historian to the docents of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>My parents never took us to art museums—\"those are for rich people\"—so my first introduction to Chicago's art treasures was on a 7th-grade public-school field trip, when our rowdy busload of racially diverse, working-class kids was met by a brave young docent who took us through the institute's awe-inspiring galleries. . . .</p><p>Lauren Arnold</p><p>Mountain View, Calif.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>Many alumni, concerned yet feeling powerless, have walked away. But not all (\"Alumni Unite for Freedom of Speech\" by Stuart Taylor Jr. and Edward Yingling, op-ed, Oct. 18). Perhaps the shock of seeing free speech under siege has shaken their complacency and steeled a new resolve. In the minds and hearts of increasing numbers of alumni, the stakes are too high and their love for their alma maters too great to meekly surrender. From Princeton to Davidson, they're fed up and fighting back. . . .</p><p>Alumni Are Fed Up and Ready to Fight Back | Oct. 21</p><p>For higher education, there is a road map to higher ground. . . .</p><p>Susan J. Crawford</p><p>Swanton, Md.</p><p>Judge Crawford is chair emerita of Bucknell University's board of trustees.</p><p>Kenneth G. Langone</p><p>New York</p><p>Mr. Langone is a co-founder of Home Depot and an emeritus trustee of Bucknell University.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>If I Did What the Government Told Me to Do | Oct. 27</p><p>Your editorial \"Bernie's Surprise Medicare Bill\" (Oct. 11) describes an attempt to involve the government in more areas of medicine. This will come with frustration. The government already demands that clinicians do things that have nothing to do with the problems for which patients come to the office. . . .</p><p>If I were really to do all this at every session, instead of lying about it, my long-term patients would certify me into a lunatic asylum. . . .</p><p>Surendra Kelwala, M.D.</p><p>Livonia, Mich.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>President Trump Responds on Pennsylvania's 2020 Election | Oct. 28</p><p>In your editorial \"The Election for Pennsylvania's High Court\" (Oct. 25), you state the fact that a court wrongly said mail-in ballots could be counted after Election Day. \"This didn't matter,\" you add, \"because Mr. Biden won the state by 80,555, but the country is lucky the election wasn't closer. If the election had hung on a few thousand Pennsylvanians, the next President might have been picked by the U.S. Supreme Court.\"</p><p>Well actually, the election was rigged, which you, unfortunately, still haven't figured out. Here are just a few examples. . . .</p><p>Donald J. Trump</p><p>Palm Beach, Fla.</p><p>Read the full letter here.</p><p>Read the editorial board's response here.</p><p>10 Letters to Read: October's Most Notable Letters to the Editor</p>",
