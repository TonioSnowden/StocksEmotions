  "text": "<p>   A turning point for disc golf, the Holy Shot was the No. 1 play on ESPN's SportsCenter Top Ten and went viral online, exposing thousands of people to the sport and its stars. \"I was there in person and I've never experienced anything like it at a sporting event ever,\" Mr. Hill said. \"It was the most mind-boggling explosion where everyone collectively lost their mind.\" </p><p>   Mr. Conrad, a 31-year-old former warehouse worker who made the shot, said hitting the best shot of his life at the exact moment he needed to win \"was like being in a sports movie.\" </p><p>   He said he is proud that the popularity of the shot brought new fans to disc golf, even though he was disappointed that he didn't win any subsequent major tournaments. </p><p>   \"The remainder of the season wasn't able to match what I did at the world's, but I'm not sure I'll ever be able to match that,\" he said. \"It's a weird thought that maybe the coolest thing I'll ever do, I've already done.\" </p><p>   The player he beat that day has been the sport's dominant player for a decade: Paul McBeth, a 31-year-old from Huntington Beach, Calif. He said he was happy for Mr. Conrad, who he has been competing against since they were both 15 and who he sees nearly weekly during the eight-month season. </p><p>   \"I was on the losing end of that shot, but I still know what it means for the sport and for us as players,\" Mr. McBeth said. \"It's a chance for growth, a chance for more eyes to see our sport on a professional level.\" </p><p>   Mr. McBeth's sponsor, Discraft, thinks his star power will help the company grow. Discraft signed him to a new 10-year, $10 million contract last year, a figure designed to plant a flag in a sport where most professionals typically make roughly $20,000 a year in sponsorships and tournament winnings. As a signing bonus, Mr. McBeth got a McLaren supercar. \"It's the Nike strategy,\" said Bob Julio, Discraft's team manager. \"Sign the player and the fans will follow.\" </p><p>   When the pandemic hit, Discraft shifted machines that made Ultimate discs to make ones for disc golf. When plastic became scarce, Discraft bought an industrial recycling machine and churned up factory seconds and castoff discs to make plastic pellets that could be mixed in with new ones. \"You can't even tell it's in there,\" Chief Operating Officer Mike Wagner said. </p><p>   The company has 90 employees, up from 40 before the pandemic. It has doubled its number of machines but is struggling to staff them at every shift. Mr. Wagner says he has tried everything from gift cards to attendance bonuses to entice workers to the factory floor. </p><p>   Discraft has upped its disc-golf production 600% in the past two years but isn't accepting new retail customers or rolling out new models. Instead, it is sending longtime vendors an allotment of whatever it makes, dominated by the Buzzz, a 2003 design with an even distribution of weight that makes it comparatively easy to throw for new players. \"I want to get a handle on the 600% [growth] we've got,\" Mr. Wagner said. \"You've got to have a manageable pace because a lot can go wrong.\" </p><p></p>",
