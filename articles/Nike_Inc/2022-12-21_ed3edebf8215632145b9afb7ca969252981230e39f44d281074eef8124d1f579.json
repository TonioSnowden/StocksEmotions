  "text": "<p>Nike has given the global sporting goods sector a much-needed boost after consumers snapped up discounted footwear, clothing and equipment ahead of Christmas, prompting it to upgrade sales forecasts.</p> <p>While promotions to clear inventory hit margins, investors were reassured by a 17 per cent rise in revenues in the three months to the end of November to $13.3bn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/416a5ed9-f17f-404d-83e5-f2c3716d122b\">Nike</a> said it now expected annual revenues to increase by a “low teens” percentage after the effects of currency fluctuations were stripped out, an improvement from its previous forecast of a “low double-digit” increase, although it said that foreign exchange rates would be a “headwind”. </p> <p>The better than expected results after the New York closing bell on Tuesday sent shares in Nike up 13 per cent in out-of-hours trading and spurred a rally in European competitors. Puma and Adidas both rose roughly 6 per cent in Frankfurt, while JD Sports jumped 8 per cent in London.</p> <p>“Nike's results show that consumer demand remains very strong for the brand, which is positive for the wider athleisure market given its scale,” said Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec.</p> <p>North America performed particularly strongly for Nike. Sales of footwear in the region rose 39 per cent, equipment 26 per cent and clothing 14 per cent. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region was not as strong, although revenues there still rose 11 per cent. </p> <p>The double-digit growth helped offset weak demand in China, where sales have been held back by Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>The figures suggested customer demand was “holding up better than expected” in the US, said Emily Salter, an analyst at consultancy GlobalData, even if they also showed the company had resorted to higher discounts to sell off stock.</p> <p>However, she added that much of the improvement was “very specific to Nike”.</p> <p>Like other sports retailers, Nike has struggled to manage stock levels during the pandemic because of supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand. Shares in the company have dropped almost 40 per cent this year.</p> <p>Analysts noted that stock levels — valued at $9.3bn as of the end of the quarter — remained high, but chief executive John Donahoe said the “challenges are transitory” and that the “inventory peak is behind us”.</p> <p>Nike was also well placed to capitalise on the popularity of more casual styles in the wake of the pandemic and its brand recognition, which supported online sales, Salter added.</p> <p>Nike's diluted earnings rose 2 per cent to 85 cents a share. That beat an average estimate of 64 cents in a Refinitiv poll. Net income was flat at $1.3bn.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray and Sarah Provan in London 2022 'Nike boosts global sportswear sector with upbeat forecast' FT.com 21 December.
