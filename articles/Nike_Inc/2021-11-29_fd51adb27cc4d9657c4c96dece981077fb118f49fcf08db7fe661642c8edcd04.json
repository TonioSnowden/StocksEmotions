  "text": "<p>On November 28, the protean American fashion designer Virgil Abloh diedat the age of 41. At his line Off-White, established in 2013, he helped usher in a new era of luxe streetwear that was marked by frequent collaborations and sought-after sneaker designs. In 2018, Abloh was appointed creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear, where he challenged the limits of men's fashion with colorful and creatively accessorized collections that proposed new silhouettes in tailoring. This September, Abloh gathered his favorite objects for WSJ., including an African sculpture and Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force 1 sneakers—yet another collaboration that he had overseen. \"It transcends a shoe,\" he said. \"It says something about our human history, about our current times.\"</p><p>Abloh also supported the diversification of the fashion industry through a website he named \"Imaginary TV\" and a fund in partnership with Evian, Farfetch, Louis Vuitton, New Guards Group and Nike called Virgil Abloh ™ \"Post-Modern\" Scholarship Fund. \"When I started in fashion, the door was closed,\" he told WSJ. \"The forefront of fashion is not a trend, it's not a fabric, it's not a self-serving prophecy, it's empowerment.\"</p><p>Here, view images of Abloh's work as featured on the likes of Kevin Durant and Lucas Hedges from the pages—and on the cover—of WSJ. Magazine. —Elisa Lipsky-Karasz </p><p>A$AP Rocky in Louis Vuitton for a March 2020 cover story for WSJ. Magazine, shot by Juergen Teller and styled by Matthew Henson. PHOTO: JUERGEN TELLER FOR WSJ.
