  "title": "Surprise! Gen Z embraces designer ‘mystery boxes'",
  "text": "<p>Beth Froggatt, a 27-year-old hair salon owner from Sheffield, recently added a boxy black handbag by Off-White to her wardrobe. She wears the bag, featuring a chunky chain strap, with both denim and evening dresses alike. “I love it. Virgil Abloh is one of my favourite designers,” she says. But Froggatt never actually picked it out for herself; rather, this handbag, which retails for £830, arrived in the post as the star accessory in a £500 “mystery box” from a company called Heat. </p> <p>Mystery boxes proffered by trendy upstarts including Heat, Scarce and Hybe, are a relatively new and simple concept. Shoppers buy a box when they “drop” online — from upwards of £299 at Heat — then receive a package of luxury surprises with a guaranteed retail value (£299 from Heat gets you £500+ worth of goods, £500 upwards of £850). Wares from Saint Laurent, Celine and Balenciaga are all up for grabs. “I also received a Palm Angels logo hoodie worth £500,” says Froggatt, who liked the three things she received. “To shop designer brands for less is a huge selling point for me.” </p> <p>The clothes come from stock that would otherwise end up in cut-price outlets — or in landfill. During the pandemic, factories, brands and retailers have been left with mountains of unsold goods. As of last April, Swedish fast fashion giant H&amp;M was sitting on £3.4bn of leftover merchandise. But offering constant cut-price sales to deal with the deluge affects a brand's equity — and some brands still destroy their unsold stock rather than risk devaluing it. </p> <p>“The fashion industry is extremely wasteful,” says Jacob Metzger, 34, co-founder of the New York-based Scarce, which launched its first box in December 2020. “We wanted to prevent this old inventory from going to landfill or sitting in a warehouse. We wanted to give it a second life.” </p> <p>Joe Wilkinson, 24-year-old co-founder of the Sheffield-based Heat, had a similar mission: “We kept thinking, how can we get this deadstock inventory to the end consumer?” </p> <p>Making it desirable is the primary task. Capitalising on the trend for “unboxing”, where YouTubers open goods on camera, Wilkinson built pre-launch hype around Heat aimed at his target demographic — logo-emblazoned clothes, paid-for influencer posts and Gen Z-appropriate branding reminiscent of the flame emoji. </p> <p>“We had to prove the concept to brands,” says Wilkinson, who has a background in user-interface and user-experience design and formerly sold sneakers for profit on resale markets. Stock was initially acquired through Selfridges and Harrods; Heat got special discounts on clothes about to enter their sales. </p> <p>Since its launch last November, Heat says it has sold more than 16,000 boxes. It has now generated sales of over £6m, and expanded its customer numbers to 660,000; boxes can sell out in 10 minutes. The company now buys inventory from JW Anderson and Givenchy, while Scarce works with Gucci and Rick Owens, and Ireland-based Hybe offloads sneakers from Nike. “It's the stuff brands usually keep off the sale rails,” says Wilkinson. “The carry-over pieces that are just slightly updated each season. Brands don't want them to end up in an outlet because it devalues the product for seasons to come.” </p> <p>The sites are glossy and easy to navigate; shipping is speedy and goods arrive tissue-wrapped in the sort of aspirational packaging offered by Net-a-Porter and Matches Fashion. “They answer a real need for luxury businesses,” says Peter Baldaszti, chief executive of Budapest label Nanushka, which sold deadstock to Heat for the first time this year. “We need to maintain market position . . . and it releases products in a discreet and brand-appropriate way.” He adds: “They're targeting an as-of-yet unrecruited audience.” Namely 18-35 year-old streetwear fans. Box brands offer access to this next generation. Maybe they can't yet afford Gucci at retail, but they want to wear the logos. </p> <p>“It's a great lead generator for brands down the line . . . we have a super-engaged audience,” says Metzger, citing Scarce's 143,000 followers on Instagram. Scarce co-founder Yossi Shetrit adds: “They buy a box, they tag us, they feel like they're part of a community. Shoppers are alerted to drops through countdowns on Instagram and email; drops that sell out almost instantly. </p> <p>While the surprise is touted as a selling point, shoppers can filter their preferences — Hybe sells specific boxes for Gucci or Supreme, while Scarce and Heat enable shoppers to highlight favourite brands or eliminate certain colours. </p> <p>Naturally, not everyone likes the stuff they receive. One YouTube user, Sachit Mehta, was sent a Fear of God coat and a cardholder from A Cold Wall*; the coat was so “weirdly coloured” that he returned it. Some buyers flip these to make a quick buck from the cut-price discounts. British YouTuber Jake Buckell bought a £500 box last year; he sold his Givenchy backpack, worth £795, through Instagram. </p> <p>Metzger doesn't think resale is an issue, however, and shoppers can only return the whole box rather than an individual item. “Maybe they get one or two pieces they love, and one they don't,” he says. “We encourage them to keep moving things on to people who will really enjoy them. Our customers like being part of the circular economy.”</p> <p>But are boxes really a solution to excess production? Offering a slick way for brands to get rid of overstock does nothing to force the industry to actually stop making too many clothes. If adopted <em>en masse</em>, it could hinder, not help. Heat says it's even looking into partnerships with brands to offer exclusive items on its site for direct purchase. It would, in effect, be creating new stock — thus adding to the deluge. It also to some extent glorifies a slightly gluttonous approach to shopping.</p> <p>But for now, the mystery format has its fans. Froggatt hasn't resold any of her wares; she likes the brands and enjoys the convenience of shopping this way. “It saves me time having to pick what I want and find what's available in my size,” she says, favouring it to online doom-scrolling or endlessly schlepping around rails. </p> <p>Says Wilkinson: “It's immersive; it's exciting. In these Covid times especially, people need an experience.”</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Grace Cook 2021 'Surprise!
