We cheered heartily for great play, including by those who choose to not play only on the PGA Tour.</p><p>Stephen Lake</p><p>Newton, Mass.</p><p>It is best if nobody gets too sanctimonious about the Saudis.

Check out the dudes at the U.S. Open sporting the swoosh on their shirts, shoes and more. They sure do strike a manly pose.</p><p>Roger Ruvolo</p><p>Riverside, Calif.</p><p>LIV Golf, Saudi Arabia and PGA Hypocrisy</p>",
