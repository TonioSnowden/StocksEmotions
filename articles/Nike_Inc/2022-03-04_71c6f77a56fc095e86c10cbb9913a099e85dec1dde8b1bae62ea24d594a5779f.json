  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- More than two years into the pandemic, China has a problem that would seem very unfamiliar in the U.S. It can't persuade its people to spend more money. </p><p>   Now that is becoming a bigger worry for Beijing, which is trying to reignite growth at a time of rising economic uncertainty due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and global inflationary pressures. </p><p>   Chinese leaders are widely expected at annual parliamentary meetings starting this week to unveil measures to stimulate more spending, such as doling out consumption vouchers and subsidies on goods like cars. Authorities have also recently eased credit conditions, including making it cheaper for companies and families to obtain loans. </p><p>   China must use every possible means to support a recovery of consumption, such as extending relief measures to small businesses, said Wang Wentao, the commerce minister, on Tuesday. </p><p>   Those steps and potentially more will likely be needed if China is to achieve an expected growth target of 5% or more this year. But economists say Beijing's prescriptions will likely be offset at least in part by other competing policies. They include China's \"zero-Covid\" approach to containing the pandemic, which has led to unpredictable restrictions. </p><p>   They also include crackdowns on China's real-estate and technology sectors, which were meant to rein in speculative behavior and impose more discipline on private companies, but have also led to job losses and lower consumer confidence. </p><p>   Retail sales, a gauge of household spending, grew by just 1.7% in December from a year before, the slowest growth since August 2020 and a far cry from the 8% increase in December 2019. </p><p>   Household savings rose by 5.41 trillion yuan ($855 billion) in January, nearly four times the amount it increased in January 2021, according to data from the People's Bank of China. New household loans fell by 50% year-on-year in January. </p><p>    Chu Yingtao, an employee at a state-owned bank in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, said he and his family haven't ventured out of town for more than two years. </p><p>   \"We had much fewer gatherings in the past two years and barely dined out, because there were new outbreaks from time to time,\" said Mr. Chu. His family ended up saving more with fewer options for entertainment and spending. </p><p>   Weak consumption growth is particularly concerning for Beijing right now because a boom in exports that powered China's economic recovery since 2020 is expected to taper off, as Western buyers shift from buying toys and gadgets to spending more on services like restaurants and hotels. </p><p>   It is also a concern for some U.S. and European companies. Nike Inc. said overall sales in China fell 24% from a year earlier during the three months ended November 2021, in part because of Covid-19 outbreaks. Starbucks Corp. reported a 14% drop in same-store sales in China during the three months ended Jan. 2. </p><p>   If consumption doesn't rebound more strongly, economists say, Beijing might be tempted to return to juicing growth through heavy spending on infrastructure and real estate -- a pattern that in past years contributed to China's debt problems and added to financial risks. </p><p>   Handing out more cash to consumers could be another solution. But Beijing is unlikely to do that, said Wei Yao, chief Asia economist at Societe Generale SA. Chinese consumers are much more inclined to save than Americans and might just salt the money away. </p><p>   To be sure, there is one upside to weaker spending. China doesn't have a major problem with inflation, unlike the U.S., in part because consumer demand hasn't outstripped the supply of available goods. That gives China's central bank more room to loosen monetary policy without worrying about skyrocketing prices. </p><p>   Still, lackluster spending reflects deeper problems. </p><p>   The crackdown on technology firms has led companies like ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc. and Bytedance Ltd. to lay off tens of thousands of staff. A clampdown on for-profit private education businesses has led to less spending on tutoring and more layoffs in education. </p><p>   While average disposable income grew by 5.4% in the fourth quarter last year, that was down from 6.3% in the third quarter and far below 9.2% growth in the same period in 2019, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. </p><p></p>",
