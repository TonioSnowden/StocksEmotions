  "text": "<p>Nike's head of diversity will leave the company at the end of July after two years in the role, according to an internal email and people familiar with the matter, the second executive to leave that role in as many years. </p> <p>Felicia Mayo, who has served as chief talent, diversity and culture officer at the world's largest sportswear maker since July 2020, joined from Tesla in 2019. She <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d294e62e-21e1-40af-8774-0ff354fbf4a5\">succeeded</a> Nike's first-ever head of diversity and inclusion at a time when some employees were complaining the company fostered a boys-club culture.</p> <p>In an internal memo reviewed by the Financial Times, chief human resources officer Monique Matheson thanked Mayo for her “impact and progress” at Nike and said Jarvis Sam will take on the newly created title of chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer. </p> <p>“We're integrating the role of our DE&amp;I leader into the creation and execution of our people strategy,” Matheson wrote in the email.</p> <p>Mayo and Nike did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the departure. </p> <p>In recent years, internal factions at Nike have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8b4a2e3-e0cf-467a-890b-b64db664778a\">grappled with</a> the balance of the company's progressive marketing weighed against its own progress on diversity of its workforce, particularly in the wake of a national reckoning on racial inequality following the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police in 2020. </p> <p>Nike has raised its proportion of racial and ethnic minorities at the director level and above by more than 4 percentage points over the past fiscal year to more than 30 per cent, according to a company report published in March. As of fiscal 2019, the proportion of non-white vice-presidents was 21 per cent.</p> <p>John Donahoe, Nike's chief executive since January 2020, has said the company's priority has been “to get its own house in order” with regard to diversity. At the same time, it has been at the cultural vanguard in its advertising campaigns, enlisting its stable of A-list athletes including basketball star LeBron James and footballer Megan Rapinoe to “make the world a better place”. </p><p>Source: Sara Germano in New York 2022 'Nike's diversity head to leave company after two years' FT.com 18 May.
