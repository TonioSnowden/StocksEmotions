  "title": "The Teenager Surpassing Usain Bolt --- Erriyon Knighton, 18, has shattered the 200-meter junior record to join track's elite sprinters",
  "text": "<p>How fast was Knighton's 200? Fast enough that it would have won the gold medal at last summer's Tokyo Olympics. Faster than all but three men -- Bolt, Jamaica's Yohan Blake and retired American star Michael Johnson -- have ever run the event.</p><p>Knighton's mark not only bettered Bolt's Under-20 world record of 19.93. It pulled him to within .30 seconds of Bolt's overall 200-meter world record.</p><p>Bolt set that all-time mark, 19.19 seconds, at the 2009 world championships in Berlin, the day before his 23rd birthday. Knighton turned 18 in January.</p><p>Ato Boldon, the Trinidadian former 200-meter world champion and NBC Sports analyst, calls Knighton's feat the junior equivalent of Bob Beamon breaking the long jump world record by nearly two feet.</p><p>\"If one junior in history, who is considered the greatest sprinter of all time, has broken 20 (seconds), and now this kid is half a second -- which is a lifetime in the sprints -- faster, then yes. It's not an exaggeration to say that this is the most Beamon-esque junior performance that we have seen.\"</p><p>Knighton has gained on Bolt by running more and more like him. Knighton is 6-foot-3 and still growing, his coach says, while the retired Bolt is 6-foot-5. Both men have a long stride and a rapid step turnover -- a nearly unbeatable combination.</p><p>\"Speed is all about covering ground,\" said John Regis, the U.K. record-holder in the 200 meters and Knighton's agent. \"If you're able to turn your legs at the same rate as somebody who's 5-foot-9 and I am 6-foot-3, I will always win. And that's what Erriyon's able to do. He's able to generate so much speed and frequency in his long stride.\"</p><p>Knighton is no overnight sensation.</p><p>At last summer's U.S. Olympic trials, he beat Bolt's Under-20 world record twice -- once in a qualifying heat and again in the final, where he ran 19.84 seconds to finish third and qualify for the Tokyo Games.</p><p>In Tokyo, Knighton became the youngest man to race in an individual Olympic track final in 125 years. He finished fourth in the 200, behind winner Andre De Grasse of Canada and two American teammates, Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles.</p><p>But even Knighton, who's set to graduate from Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Fla., later this month, was shocked by the speed of his season-opening race.</p><p>\"I knew it was coming,\" Knighton told NBC Sports, \"but I didn't know it was coming this early into the season. I also didn't know that it was going to come this early in my career, either. I thought I was going to run 19.4 when I'm like, 20 or something, like when I get stronger and older.\"</p><p>Knighton was a sought-after high-school football player but turned professional in track and signed with Adidas shortly before his 17th birthday. He has a fluid, relaxed running style that reflects his approach to the sport.</p><p>\"There's no tension,\" Regis said. \"He's actually enjoying what he does. In life, when you enjoy something, you do it better.\"</p><p>Knighton's rapid progression is even more auspicious when looking at the friendly runway he faces this year. This July, the track and field world championships -- most recently held in Qatar, London and Beijing -- will be held at the lavishly rebuilt Hayward Field at the University of Oregon, the birthplace of Nike Inc.</p><p>On May 28, Knighton will race in Hayward's star-studded Prefontaine Classic meet, joining one of the fastest 100-meter fields in history. It will feature the medalists from the Tokyo Olympics -- 100-meter champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, American Fred Kerley and De Grasse -- along with reigning world champion Christian Coleman and Trayvon Bromell, winner of last year's U.S. Olympic trials.</p><p>Knighton ran a 10.04 seconds in the 100 in April, and Mike Holloway, Knighton's coach and one of Team USA's Tokyo Olympics coaches, said he's just getting started.</p><p>\"The goal is to be an all-around sprinter,\" Holloway said. \"The goal is to run the 100, the 200. He'll line up and run a 400 on occasion as he gets older.\"</p><p>Track and field's place on the global stage hasn't been the same since the 2017 retirement of Bolt, who had become its most spectacular long-running character. The 6-foot-5 Jamaican won 11 world championships and swept the 100- and 200-meter golds at the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics. He exulted in his huge victory margins, eyeing competitors as he streaked past them and punctuating wins by cocking his arms into an archer's pose.</p><p>The setting of Knighton's blistering 200 highlights the challenge of grabbing public attention in the fractured setup of American track and field. Knighton's mark came on the same weekend as two larger events -- the Drake Relays and Penn Relays -- at a meet that wasn't televised.</p><p>The LSU Invitational was even overshadowed on campus by all-day tailgating for a Garth Brooks concert that night.</p><p>Word of Knighton's run spread organically, by a video clip that rocketed around social media. Knighton will race in June's U.S. championships, where he must place in the top threeor four (depending on rules exceptions) to qualify for the team that goes to the world championships.</p><p>The fact that worlds are in Eugene, Ore., means more than just a U.S.-friendly audience. It will make for an easier physical adjustment for all American athletes, including the nation's fastest-rising sprinting star.</p><p>\"We have the home court advantage this time, versus getting acclimated to a different time zone,\" Holloway said. \"So, absolutely it'll help him to be here in the United States.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
