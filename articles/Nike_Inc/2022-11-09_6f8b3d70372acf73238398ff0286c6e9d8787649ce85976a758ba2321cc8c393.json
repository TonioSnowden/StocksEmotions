  "title": "Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass Resigns to Join Levi Strauss; Retail veteran, who has been under pressure from activist investors, to eventually become jeans maker's CEO",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Gass will leave Kohl's Dec. 2 and join Levi Strauss Jan. 2, where she will serve as president with oversight of the Levi's brand and global digital and commercial operations. The 54-year-old will succeed Levi's CEO Chip Bergh within 18 months, the company said. Mr. Bergh, who is 65 years old, has run Levi Strauss since 2011.</p><p>Ms. Gass had been job hunting for months. She was in the running for the top Starbucks Corp. job, according to a person familiar with the situation, but the coffee chain named Laxman Narasimhan as its next CEO in September.</p><p>Mr. Bergh said he instructed his search firm to reach out to Ms. Gass in September, after the activists pushed for her removal at Kohl's. She had been on Levi's list of CEO candidates since it started succession planning several years ago. \"Her skills and experience over a 30-plus-year career set her up perfectly for this job,\" Mr. Bergh said. Although Levi's is a supplier to Kohl's, the apparel company wasn't on the list that would violate her noncompete agreement.</p><p>Kohl's appointed Tom Kingsbury to serve as interim CEO until a permanent successor is named. Mr. Kingsbury is a former Burlington Stores Inc. CEO who joined Kohl's board in 2021 as part of a settlement with activists. In a statement, Ancora said it was the right time to find new leadership and it was pleased that Mr. Kingsbury was the interim CEO.</p><p>Kohl's also released preliminary results for the quarter ended Oct. 29. It said that same-store sales decreased 6.9% compared with a year earlier. Net sales fell 7.2%. The company earned 82 cents a share compared with $1.65 a share. It plans to report full results on Nov. 17.</p><p>Kohl's, with roughly 1,100 stores, has struggled to attract shoppers amid rising competition from discounters, fast-fashion chains and online competitors. Earlier this year, Kohl's scrapped plans to sell itself to the owner of Vitamin Shoppeâ€”in a debt-funded deal initially worth $8 billion but later reduced. The company's market capitalization has fallen to around $3 billion.</p><p>Ms. Gass wasn't schooled in the art of selling clothes. She studied chemical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and received a master's in business administration from the University of Washington. She then spent six years honing her marketing skills at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. before joining Starbucks in 1996.</p><p>When she departed the coffee chain after nearly 17 years, founder Howard Schultz credited her with helping develop such products as the Frappuccino.</p><p>Ms. Gass joined Kohl's in 2013 as chief customer officer with responsibility for marketing and the e-commerce business. In 2015, her role expanded to chief merchandising officer, and in 2018 she took over as CEO and joined the board.</p><p>Ms. Gass had some early success at the helm of Kohl's, telling her team that they needed to think differently and shouldn't be afraid to try new ideas. She formed a partnership with Amazon.com Inc. that allowed shoppers to use Kohl's stores to return goods bought at the online retailer. Last year, she wooed Sephora away from JCPenney, where it had operated shops for more than a decade.</p><p>She overhauled the merchandise, dropping poorly performing brands such as Dana Buchman, and bringing in new ones, including Tommy Hilfiger, Eddie Bauer and Cole Haan. She expanded the selection of activewear from brands such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc.</p><p>Ms. Gass also simplified discounts and pricing and is refurbishing stores. The company is on track to repurchase $1.3 billion in stock in the current fiscal year.</p><p>Yet, the moves haven't improved Kohl's business enough to satisfy some shareholders. While sales initially increased, they had started to decline even before the pandemic forced retailers to temporarily shut stores and kept consumers homebound. The company has faced two years with activist investors calling for board changes.</p><p>Mr. Bergh said Ms. Gass's tenure at Kohl's should be viewed through the lens of the challenges facing department stores in general, which have been losing market share for decades. \"I came to the conclusion that Kohl's is in a better place today than if she hadn't been there,\" Mr. Bergh said.</p><p>Emily Glazer and Lauren Thomas contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com</p><p>Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass Resigns to Join Levi Strauss</p>",
