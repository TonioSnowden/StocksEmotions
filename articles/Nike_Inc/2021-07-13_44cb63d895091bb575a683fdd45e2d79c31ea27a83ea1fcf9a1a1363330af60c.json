  "text": "<p>\n  Becket Adams writing for the Washington Examiner, July8: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Former media darling and convicted felon Michael Avenatti has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for attempting to extort Nike. . . . </p><p>\n  Between March 7 and May 15, 2018, alone, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC hosted the disgraced attorney for a combined 147 television interviews. That is an average of two interviews per day. </p><p>\n  \"Trump meets his match: Stormy Daniels' combative lawyer Michael Avenatti,\" an overeager Los Angeles Times reported. </p><p>\n  NBC News reported, \"Stormy Daniels's lawyer Michael Avenatti is ready for his star turn.\" </p><p>\n  \"The brilliant egomaniac who could bring down Donald Trump,\" said Slate. </p><p>\n  Avenatti was invited to the 2018 White House Correspondents' Association dinner. He appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards that same year. He was feted, celebrated, and invited to private parties hosted by media and political elites. Vanity Fair even published an entire article on Avenatti's \"style and skincare.\" </p><p>\n  The press even entertained the notion that Avenatti would make for a serious contender in the 2020 Democratic primary. </p><p>\n  The disgraced lawyer \"hit a lot of the right notes\" during his visit to Iowa in 2018, said MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, adding Democrats \"would be foolish to underestimate\" him. </p><p>\n  CNN's Brian Stelter said elsewhere in an interview with Avenatti, \"Looking ahead to 2020, one reason I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.\" </p><p></p>",
