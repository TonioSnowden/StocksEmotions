  "text": "<p>The company ONON called out its product launches during the period, including the Cloudrunner shoe, priced at $140.</p><p>\"On has always regarded pricing as a brand-positioning tool, and we are using this opportunity to defend On's premium positioning as other brands are also increasing prices,\" Coppetti said.</p><p>\"This puts On in a strong position to not only absorb some of the expected higher costs in the face of globally rising inflation, but to also reflect inflation in our own 2023 salary rounds as an important retention driver within our teams.\"</p><p>Read: Under Armour's CEO transition suggests the turnaround hasn't sparked growth fast enough, analysts say</p><p>On merchandise, which counts tennis great Roger Federer among its backers and shoe inspirations, has been on the feet of marathoners like Tadesse Abraham, who won the Zurich marathon in record fashion during the most recent quarter.
