Chinese football was in the ascendancy and President <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a4b5e92-e5e4-11e5-bc31-138df2ae9ee6\">the leading advocate</a> for the country's ambitions in the world's favourite sport.&#xa0;</p> <p>Today, the football dream has turned into a nightmare. Jiangsu, the winners of last season's Chinese league, has collapsed. In December, Guangzhou's corporate owner said it was trying to delist the club. And another team, <strong>Tianjin Quanjian</strong>, was dissolved in May. The Chinese's league's biggest signing from Europe over the winter period cost just £3m.</p> <p>What's gone wrong? As with sport all over the world, the coronavirus has hit Chinese football hard. But the fate of China's nascent league is also tied to the fortunes of some of the country's biggest corporations.</p> <p>“Prior investment strategies were not systematically thought out in the rush to earn political capital when the ‘football dream' was the hot thing,” says <strong>Jon Sullivan</strong>, an expert in China politics at the <strong>University of Nottingham</strong>.</p> <p>In the same year that Jiangsu Suning and Guangzhou Evergrande met in the final, their billionaire owners were pictured drinking baijiu.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Hui Ka Yan</strong>, the chairman of property developer <strong>Evergrande</strong>, was the country's richest man. His friend <strong>Zhang</strong> <strong>Jindong</strong> owned <strong>Suning</strong>, its largest bricks-and-mortar retailer and also owner of Italy's <strong>Inter Milan</strong> football club.&#xa0;</p> <p>Also in 2017, the latter's group lent the former Rmb20bn — enough to buy approximately 26 <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>s — as part of an investment in a property subsidiary.</p> <p>That investment went wrong last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2efb0fa3-0bcd-4400-a235-4c545089344f\">creating problems</a> for Evergrande and Suning, which declined to ask for its money back. Evergrande, the world's most indebted property business, is also under pressure from Beijing to deleverage. Suning is seeking new investors at Inter Milan, or to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fdc9a56-75c9-4101-b5c5-bf827a0e7b1d\">sell the club</a> altogether.</p> <p>In the case of <strong>Tianjin Quanjian</strong>, the now non-existent team that once signed Belgian star <strong>Alex Witsel</strong>, readers may guess that <strong>Quanjian</strong> is a company. Specifically, it was a herbal medicine group whose owner, <strong>Shu Yuhui</strong>, is currently serving a nine-year jail term for organising a pyramid scheme.</p> <p>While coronavirus has had a short-term impact, political shifts in the corporate environment may have a deeper effect on investment.&#xa0;</p> <p>The government late last year banned companies from using their name for football teams. If the one surviving team from that 2017 match ever reaches the final again, it'll be <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/11/c_139658330.htm#:~:text=China's%20Guangzhou%20Evergrande%20changes%20name%20to%20%22Guangzhou%20football%20club%22,-Source%3A%20Xinhua%7C%202021&amp;text=GUANGZHOU%2C%20China%2C%20Jan\">plain old Guangzhou football club</a>.</p> <p><em>Read the FT analysis on how corporate China's broken ties to football</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/067b5032-9d35-44b8-a425-854eb383f229\"><em> here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Building the investment case for women's sport</strong></p> <p>Why is investment in women's sport substantially lower than that for men's?&#xa0;</p> <p>The question elicits a well-worn response. Viewership of women's sport trails that of male counterparts. Ergo lower rights fees from broadcasters. Ergo lower spending on advertising. Et cetera, ad nauseam.</p> <p>The numbers seem to back up the thesis. More than 91 million people tuned in to watch <strong>Tom Brady</strong> win his seventh <strong>Super Bowl </strong>in the <strong>National Football League </strong>in February, in what will probably be the highest-rated broadcast of any kind in the US this year. Meanwhile, just 653,000 watched the <strong>National Women's Soccer League </strong>Challenge Cup final in July, all according to SportsMedia Watch.</p> <p>But recently, Olympic ice hockey champion <strong>Angela Ruggiero</strong> had a thought: why, in an era where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf22ac6b-c065-4657-bbe6-6689c625461d\">the future of linear television is being questioned</a>, are TV viewership figures still the metric by which a sport's popularity is measured?</p> <p>As co-founder of the research firm <strong>Sports Innovation Lab</strong>, Ruggiero has launched an initiative called <strong>The Fan Project</strong>. Its aim is to collect social media data from a wide swath of fans to build a new model for measuring the true market size of women's sport.</p> <p>“What if, say, women's basketball is the biggest underserved market in women's sport?” she said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48084071-bec2-481f-b624-8878b613456e\">in an interview with the FT</a>. “That would be a hell of a data point.”</p> <p>The idea is there are more ways to measure fan engagement: not only broadcasts and ticket sales, but social media likes and search functions and <strong>Facebook Live</strong> streams.&#xa0;</p> <p>At the same time, US women are poised for what could be one of the most substantial transfers of wealth in history.&#xa0;</p> <p>As of 2020, American women controlled almost $11tn in assets, a figure that is expected to balloon to $30tn by the end of the decade, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/women-as-the-next-wave-of-growth-in-us-wealth-management\">according to <strong>McKinsey</strong></a>. That means a growing investor class, perhaps one likelier to invest in women's sport.</p> <p>“After years of playing second fiddle to men, women are poised to take centre stage,” the consultancy wrote.</p> <p>To be sure, investment opportunities are not open solely to women, as illustrated by the recent sale of basketball's <strong>Atlanta Dream</strong> to <strong>Larry Gottesdiener </strong>and former player <strong>Renee Montgomery</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>And to put recent viewership data in context, the 2021 Super Bowl was <a href=\"https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/02/super-bowl-ratings-lowest-52-years-buccaneers-chiefs/\">the worst-rated since 1969</a>, while the NWSL championship match was the league's <a href=\"https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2020/07/nwsl-ratings-record-cbs-challenge-cup-pga-tour-ufc-wnba-pll/\">most-watched broadcast ever</a>.</p> <p>Taken together, the answer to why women's sports are relatively underinvested may soon have to change.</p> <p><em>Read the FT profile of Angela Ruggiero and The Fan Project </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48084071-bec2-481f-b624-8878b613456e\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Crisis-hit UK horseracing industry demands tax reform</strong></p> <p>Just as one of the biggest events on the UK horseracing calendar, the <strong>Cheltenham Festival</strong>, is due to begin the sport is running into trouble.</p> <p><strong>Julie Harrington</strong>, chief executive of the <strong>British Horseracing Authority</strong>, the national governing body, says animal welfare concerns are an “existential crisis”. Her intervention came after <strong>Grand National</strong>-winning trainer <strong>Gordon Elliott</strong> was banned after being pictured sitting on a dead horse.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then there's the industry ties to <strong>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum</strong>, the ruler of Dubai and the owner of the <strong>Godolphin </strong>stables. He's under heavy scrutiny after allegations that one of his daughters is being held hostage in the emirate. Godolphin and Dubai's government did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>And British racing has also lost more than £300m in revenues due to the pandemic. Before coronavirus, punters would wager about £500m across the four-day Cheltenham Festival. This year, <strong>Global Betting and Gaming Consultants</strong> expects that to fall by around £100m, as gamblers place their bets exclusively online rather than at the racecourse or in betting shops up and down the country.</p> <p>Buffeted by these issues, the industry faces an uncertain financial future.&#xa0;</p> <p>That comes back to the eternal problem in British racing, which, unlike its rivals in France and Hong Kong, does not own the bookmakers that take bets on the horses. Instead, a tax is imposed on bookies' gross profits known as “the levy”.</p> <p>The tax raised £83m in 2018/19, down from £95m a year earlier. The proceeds are hard to predict, because of the risk that punters outsmart the odds, so hitting the profits of betting companies.</p> <p>Some argue that the levy should be calculated on turnover instead, therefore removing the reliance on bookies' profitability. Gambling companies are resistant, seeing this as just a new tax hike on their operations.</p> <p><strong>Simon Bazalgette</strong>, former chief executive of <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jockey Club</strong>, the racecourse owner, says simply changing how the levy is calculated carries risks as well.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unexpected events, such as global pandemics, whack betting turnover as well as profit. He suggests introducing a more “sophisticated” measure, such as taking into account the benefit gambling companies derive from using racing to promote other products to punters.</p> <p>The predicted decline in turnover at Cheltenham underlines why the reformers must tread carefully.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Read the FT analysis on the British horseracing crisis </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09b6e3ca-d601-40e1-a01d-fc63c3f869b3\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>CVC Capital Partners </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c861824-040c-474b-b94c-251c9bdd5dae\">agreed to pay up to £365m</a> for a minority stake in the <strong>Six Nations</strong> rugby union tournament, as the private equity group seals a crucial deal in its strategy to become the sport's biggest commercial player.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Football Index</strong>, an online betting company that styled itself as a stock market for football, has appointed administrators and had its gambling licences suspended.
