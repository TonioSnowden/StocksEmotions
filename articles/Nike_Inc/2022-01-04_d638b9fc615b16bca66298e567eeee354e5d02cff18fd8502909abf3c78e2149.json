  "title": "Washington Football Team to Announce New Name Next Month; Change comes a year and a half after the team dropped Redskins from its name",
  "text": "<p>In July 2020, the Washington team dropped its name, the Redskins, after 87 years. The name was widely seen as a racial slur, and the need for a change took on new and urgent importance at a time of reckoning over systemic racism in 2020.</p><p>Politicians, activists and eventually the team's sponsors, such as FedEx Corp., called on the team to get rid of the name and mascot that dated back to 1933, when the team played in Boston. Nike Inc., the NFL's official apparel partner, also removed Washington gear from its website in July 2020. Other major financial partners of the team, such as PepsiCo and Bank of America, issued similar messages at the time.</p><p>On July 3, 2020, the team announced it was undertaking a \"thorough review\" of the name. On July 13, the team announced that the name and the logo was retired.</p><p>The team's owner, Dan Snyder, had previously vowed to never change the name. In 2014, the team put out a video entitled \"Redskins is a Powerful Name,\" which showed Native Americans in support of the team's name.</p><p>Since the change, the team has gone by the name the Washington Football Team.</p><p>In September 2021, during an appearance on an ESPN podcast, the team's co-CEO Tanya Snyder said the final eight candidates for potential names were: Presidents, Brigade, Armada, Commanders, Red Hogs, Defenders, RedWolves and Football Team.</p><p>\"Once we began looking into Wolves, however, we became aware of a notable challenge: Trademarks held by other teams would limit our ability to make the name our own,\" Mr. Wright wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Wright said he understands it is impossible to choose a new name that all fans would want as their first pick, but that he is excited about the final selection of names, which, \"aligns with our values, carries forth our rich history, represents the region and, most importantly, is inspired and informed by you, our fans.\"</p><p>Even beyond the team name, racism haunted the Washington team's past. A monument to former owner George Preston Marshall, who long blocked the team from signing Black players, was taken down in June 2020 outside the team's former home at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.</p><p>Before Washington dropped the Redskins, Major League Baseball's Cleveland franchise removed its mascot Chief Wahoo—a caricature of a Native American person derided by many as racist—from its caps and uniforms in 2018. The team announced last year it was changing its name to the Guardians from the Indians, a change that went into effect at the end of the 2021 season.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com</p><p>Washington Football Team to Announce New Name Next Month</p>",
