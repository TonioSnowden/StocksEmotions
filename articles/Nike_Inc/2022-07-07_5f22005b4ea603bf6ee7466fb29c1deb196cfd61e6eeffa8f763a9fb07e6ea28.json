  "text": "<p>Does he get the full nightmare, the rampaging tennis legend who has somehow turned back the clock in 2022, winning the Australian and French Opens and suddenly making an unexpected charge at a calendar Grand Slam?</p><p>Or does he get the injured Nadal, the beaten-down but still dangerous escape artist who needed five sets and a tiebreak to stop U.S. upstart Taylor Fritz in Wednesday's quarterfinals?</p><p>Or does Kyrgios get…neither one of them? A worn-looking Nadal, now 36, could not rule out ghosting his next opponent.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Nadal said Wednesday when asked directly if he'd line up against Kyrgios. \"Honestly, I can't give you a clear answer, because if I gave you a clear answer and tomorrow another thing happens, I will be a liar.\"</p><p>My guess is Nadal plays, and Kyrgios gets something in the middle: hurt and slower, but crafty and mildly terrifying.</p><p>Nadal's chronic pain is no secret—his left foot is basically a cinder block in a Nike, and he suffered a stress fracture in his ribs earlier in the year.</p><p>Now he is struggling with an abdominal injury which worsened sharply, limiting his explosiveness on ground strokes and reducing his serve to something flat-footed and tepid.</p><p>He isn't the full Nadal. Not even close.</p><p>At the same time, he's one of the most relentless competitors on the planet, and despises the idea of walking away. Nadal refused to quit against Fritz, even when his father, Sebastian, and his sister, Maria Isabel, watched him grimacing and appeared to signal him to call it off.</p><p>\"They told me to retire the match, yeah,\" Nadal said.</p><p>\"It's something that I hate to do. So I just keep trying, and that's it.\"</p><p>Would you expect anything different? Nadal's victory over Fritz was a master class in making something out of nothing: deprived of almost all of his power, he changed speeds with junkball slices and shortened points to limit Fritz's momentum. His serve velocity dropped close to 20 miles an hour, but it seemed to have the effect of a change-up pitch.</p><p>Fritz admitted later it threw him off.</p><p>\"I had to…take a bigger swing on the return,\" Fritz said. \"I actually felt like it made it tougher for me.\"</p><p>It was like watching a skilled pilot land an old plane with no wheels and a flaming engine. Nadal's 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) will be remembered for its tenaciousness more than its shotmaking, but it was a thrill to observe in the flesh. The crowd, fully in the tank for the 22-time major winner, erupted when he finally sealed it.</p><p>\"I mean, it's Nadal,\" said Fritz. \"How can you question anybody for wanting to cheer for him?\"</p><p>Nadal's vulnerability casts an odd vibe over Wimbledon's final weekend, but the whole tournament has felt slightly askew, with its prohibited Russian stars (including World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev), early fizzles from women's World No. 1 Iga Swiatek and national treasure Emma Raducanu, a first-round exit from Serena Williams, and a nonplaying cameo from injury-rehabbing Roger Federer, who arrived in a sharp suit for the 100th anniversary celebration for the hallowed Centre Court.</p><p>All that, and Boris Johnson is resigning over at No. 10.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the second men's semi is six-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, who faces 26-year old Brit Cameron Norrie on Friday. Norrie is the first U.K. player in the men's semis since Andy Murray, and he may have a rowdy home crowd on his side.</p><p>Djokovic isn't unfamiliar with hostile audiences, and tends to thrive in them. But he's not the full Nole, either—he needed to roar back from a two-set deficit to beat Italy's Jannik Sinner in the quarters, and he's finding his footing in a disjointed season which began with his unvaccinated exile from the Australian Open.</p><p>As for Kyrgios, it's his first visit to a major semifinal in his career. The 27-year-old Australian is an electric talent who has frequently been undone by inconsistency and acts of self-sabotage, and has spoken freely about his struggles with his mental health. At this tournament he has already been fined twice—once for spitting toward a spectator, and another for cursing at an umpire—as news broke of a court order in Australia to appear on a charge of assaulting an ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Friday's match will be the biggest stage of his tennis career. It's also kind of a reprise—Kyrgios audaciously announced himself in pro tennis by toppling top-seeded Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014, when Kyrgios was 19 years old.</p><p>And Rafael Nadal, eight years later? Never count a determined icon out. To repeat what Taylor Fritz said in defeat: It's Nadal.</p><p>With a Wimbledon title looming, he'll be a handful, in any condition.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Who do you think will meet in the Wimbledon men's final? Do you think it'll be Nadal and Djokovic—or will a first-timer break through?
