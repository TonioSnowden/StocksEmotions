  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Levi's Backs Away From Cotton Board  ----  By Stu Woo and Suzanne Kapner",
  "text": "<p>\n  Levi Strauss &amp; Co. is leaving the board of a high-profile fashion-industry coalition, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that presents a leadership gap in a group divided over how to respond to alleged human-rights abuses in China's cotton-rich Xinjiang region. </p><p>\n  The group, called the Better Cotton Initiative, includes some of the West's most prominent brands, including Levi's, Nike Inc. and Adidas AG. Earlier this year, the group became the target of attacks by China's ruling Communist Party and pro-Beijing social-media influencers, after it raised concerns about alleged forced labor in the region. </p><p>\n  After those attacks, BCI and several of its fashion-brand members reversed course on the issue. BCI deleted from its website a statement about its concerns in Xinjiang. Several of its members did the same. </p><p>\n  Levi's was one of the group's founding members and biggest advocates. BCI was created in 2009 as a partnership among fashion brands, suppliers and nongovernmental organizations to promote sustainability and labor rights. Levi's was one of three big Western brands on the board, which typically has 12 representatives. </p><p>\n  The coalition hasn't commented on Xinjiang or the Chinese backlash since taking down its statement four months ago. Members of the coalition, a not-for-profit organization based in Geneva and London, remain torn over how and when to respond to the Chinese attacks, according to people familiar with the debate. Some nongovernment organizations and brands want BCI to swiftly and forcefully rebut the Chinese attacks, the people said, while others are pushing for a slower and more cautious approach. </p><p>\n  Jeffrey Hogue, Levi's chief sustainability officer as well as its representative on BCI's board, plans to vacate his BCI board seat imminently, instead of finishing a four-year term scheduled to end next year, according to people familiar with the matter. A Levi's spokeswoman said Mr. Hogue is new to the company and is focused on its coming sustainability report. Mr. Hogue joined Levi's last year, inheriting the board seat from his predecessor. </p><p>\n  Levi's says its status as a BCI member remains unchanged. </p><p>\n  BCI declined to comment on Levi's board representation. </p><p>\n  The Chinese government has disputed the allegations of forced labor, calling them lies and saying it is combating terrorism and improving livelihoods in Xinjiang. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  H&amp;M, Adidas Felt </p><p>\n  Fallout in China </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Better Cotton Initiative, which briefly raised concerns about alleged forced labor in the China's cotton-rich Xinjiang region, has struggled for months to respond in a standoff with Beijing that resulted in some of members losing sales in China. </p><p>\n  Earlier this year, H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB, which serves on BCI's board, was largely erased from China's internet, with its name disappearing from online stores and map apps. </p><p>\n  H&amp;M and Adidas AG, another board member, both have suffered from a consumer backlash emanating from BCI's earlier stance on Xinjiang. </p><p>\n  Last month, H&amp;M said sales in China fell about 28%, representing about $74 million, in the quarter ended May 31 compared with the year-earlier period. </p><p>\n  Adidas said Thursday that second-quarter sales in its Greater China market declined 16% compared with a year earlier. Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told analysts that the \"geopolitical situation\" affected sales, but that he expected a strong rebound in China starting this year. </p><p>\n  Levi's doesn't break out detailed figures for sales from China, saying only that its second-quarter revenue in the country grew 3% compared with 2019, before the pandemic. Levi's says it gets about 3% of its sales from mainland China. </p><p></p>",
