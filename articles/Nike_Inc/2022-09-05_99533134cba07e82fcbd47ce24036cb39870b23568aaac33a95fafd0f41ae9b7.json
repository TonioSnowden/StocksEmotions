  "title": "Thom Browne Can Envision an Entire Season in 5–10 Minutes; The fashion designer begins each day with an eight-mile run and a pastry before heading into the office. This month, his brand opens its 85th store, in San Francisco.",
  "text": "<p>Browne, who was born and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, moved to New York City in the 1990s and launched his own collection in 2003. David Bowie and Richard Avedon became clients a few years later. In 2011, he added womenswear. Browne has become known not just for his suiting and red, white and blue striped trim, but also for his theatrical runway shows, which often feature models in fantastical animal costumes and other surrealist elements.</p><p>These days, Browne still lives and works in New York, with his partner, Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. Browne is ramping up his brand's brick-and-mortar presence, with plans to expand from 84 to 100 locations by the end of next year, including a new store in San Francisco opening this month. Here, Browne speaks to WSJ. about his creative process and men wearing skirts.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>I usually get up between 6 and 6:30 a.m. I have a cup of tea, watch the news, and then I run, usually around eight miles a day.</p><p>Do you have a go-to breakfast?</p><p>Before I head into the office, I always stop at Sant Ambroeus and have a double espresso and a sugar cornetti at the bar.</p><p>What's the first thing that happens when you get into the office?</p><p>I have a cup of coffee. My team is very close to me, so it's a lot of conversation. More than sketching, it's a lot of conversation with my design team.</p><p>At what time of the day or week are you most creative?</p><p>I never really know when it's going to come. It's usually after work. I'm very regimented in regards to making sure I end the day. I love at 6 o'clock to have a drink time, having a glass of champagne with Andrew at home. In a way, most of the creativity is not during work times. Most collections are thought of and designed on planes. I actually leave town, and I think my mind has opened up so much more. The noise of the city is gone.</p><p>When was your last creative breakthrough on a plane?</p><p>Usually every time. I was flying back to Paris a couple weeks ago. Getting ready for [the women's spring 2023 collection] was top of my mind. Sometimes it doesn't take that much time to design a whole collection. I can do it sometimes in five, 10 minutes, in regards to just getting the idea together. Getting it all made [takes] time.</p><p>What are you finding inspiration in right now?</p><p>Right now, it's home. Andrew and I just moved into our home a couple months ago. So I am inspired by the space we were able to put together, together. The quiet time at home is probably the most inspirational right now.</p><p>How do your design sensibilities merge?</p><p>They merge in regards to there being a clean, modern approach to our space, but Andrew starts more from a late 18th, 19th century, and mine starts from a more '30s and '40s sensibility.</p><p>Is there a secret to creating a great uniform?</p><p>Knowing yourself and knowing what's good for you and what you want to commit to. I love the confidence that it shows when you see somebody who has a real sense of themself, and a sense of what looks good for them.</p><p>What's been your favorite part of working on the new San Francisco location so far?</p><p>The most important thing for each store is that it feels specific to the location and in keeping with the established feel of my stores. I love the location of Jackson Square because it felt like it was a little bit off the more commercial area of San Francisco. We have a lot of existing customers in San Francisco, and I feel like it was a more special experience for them in that neighborhood.</p><p>Do you find it easy to conceive and open new stores?</p><p>It's really easy, because I want it to stay true to what it has been and what it was at the beginning. I never really thought of them as retail stores. The architecture and furniture that go into stores is really the experience I want people to have, and there just happens to be clothing within those stores. The furniture in all the stores are all real pieces of furniture; they're not store fixtures.</p><p>Your sense of humor informs your work. What's funny to you?</p><p>It's usually not so intellectual. It's usually something very sophomoric. I like to play with very childlike ideas. I'm very instinctual when it comes to design. I don't overthink things. I like to play. I like people to have a real reaction to my work, whether it be good or bad.</p><p>How do you think about the experience of your fashion shows?</p><p>My shows are just as important as the collections. The shows are how I want people to see the six months of development, of how I move that gray suit forward every season. The story is important, the experience is important. Of course, the clothing is very important,but I like the whole thing to be an experience that, without one piece, you would miss something.</p><p>You've long been a proponent of shorts in the office. Are others catching up to your vision?</p><p>I don't think it's a conversation anymore. I think now it's skirts for men. That's the next step. Over the 20 years that my collections have been around, men and women have embraced so much more, men in particular. It's so nice to see how open-minded people are.</p><p>Will skirts for men filter into the mainstream soon?</p><p>I don't see why they wouldn't. When I first entertained the idea in collections, it was never a trend for me. It's our job as designers to introduce ideas that eventually will become a lot more understandable. At the beginning, it almost shouldn't be understandable to people. And then it should start. As long as you do it in a very authentic way. [Skirts] just look really good.</p><p>What's a piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>My parents always said, Just be true to yourself.</p><p>5 Monday Must-Haves</p><p>Antique Cartier Tank Gold Wristwatch</p><p>\"Keeps me on time and fully dressed.\"</p><p>Haviland Marthe Ritz Coffee Cup &amp; Saucer</p><p>\"A little reminder of my home in Paris.\"</p><p>Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea</p><p>\"The perfect start to my day.\"</p><p>Sant Ambroeus Coffee and Sugar Cornetti</p><p>\"The breakfast of champions.\"</p><p>Nike Air Max 90 Running Shoes</p><p>\"A couple of miles every day clears the head.\"</p><p>Thom Browne Can Envision an Entire Season in 5–10 Minutes</p>",
