  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sneakerheads have a reputation for bidding prices up. Unfortunately for Foot Locker, that wasn't the case for its shares when the company announced two acquisitions on Monday. </p><p>\n  Foot Locker said it is buying WSS, a Los Angeles athletic retailer, and Atmos, a Japanese streetwear and sneaker seller, for $1.1 billion in total. The company paid for the separate transactions with cash, which represents about half of its cash balance as of last quarter. The acquisitions are expected to add to Foot Locker's bottom line this year, but its shares fell 2% on Monday and 0.5% on Tuesday. </p><p>\n  Given Foot Locker's heavy exposure to mall-based stores, some diversification seems to be prudent. The pandemic showed the wisdom of diversifying from traditional selling channels. The WSS store fleet is entirely off-mall and concentrated along the West Coast, an area where Foot Locker has less of a presence, and Atmos brings e-commerce exposure. While Foot Locker derived roughly one-quarter of its sales online last quarter, Atmos generated more than 60% of its sales digitally last year. </p><p>\n  It helps that the two retailers serve different ends of the price spectrum. WSS sells cheaper products and caters to families; Atmos is known for premium products and collaborations with popular brands such as Nike, Vans and Adidas. The exposure to two very different pricing tiers could be a helpful hedge against weak consumer sentiment on either end of the income spectrum. And the addition of Atmos, which has a reputation with sneakerheads, could help solidify Foot Locker's relationship with Nike, which is becoming pickier about which retailers sell its products. </p><p>\n  That said, the deal didn't come cheap. For WSS, Foot Locker paid roughly 1.8 times the retailer's 2020 revenue, while for Atmos it paid 2.1 times on the same basis. The purchase price for Atmos actually could rise, depending on its revenue and earnings performance. Those are hefty premiums compared with Foot Locker, which itself trades at roughly 0.8 times by the same measure. To justify the price, Foot Locker will have to prove that the newly acquired companies have a better growth trajectory. Otherwise, its cash would have been better spent keeping investors happy through share repurchases. </p><p>\n  High growth is easier to visualize for WSS, for which Foot Locker provided actual numbers. The retailer increased its revenue by 15% annually on average from 2017 to 2020 -- a much better pace than Foot Locker, which shrank by roughly 1% a year on average over the same period. Moreover, WSS caters to a Latino customer base, which Foot Locker said is an important and fast-growing demographic. The company didn't lay out any such details for Atmos except to say the purchase will give Foot Locker a foothold in the Asia-Pacific region, where the company has very little market share. </p><p>\n  There are other details that Foot Locker left out during its call with analysts on Monday morning, such as how profitable each of the companies is and what their balance sheets look like. Given that WSS has been around since the 1980s and Atmos since 2000, there should be more than enough data to share. Foot Locker also didn't cite any specific dollar amounts for synergies that might result from the acquisitions. </p><p>\n  Another recent deal shows that sneakers and commerce can generate a lot of hype. In April, StockX, an online resale marketplace that sells sneakers, streetwear and other items, notched a $3.8 billion valuation, or 9.5 times 2020 revenue. </p><p>\n  Unfortunately for those in bricks-and-mortar retail, their investors need to see and touch the growth to believe it. </p><p></p>",
