  "text": "<p>The world's biggest hotel groups have come under renewed pressure to cut operating contracts in Russia after Best Western and Hyatt became the first to terminate deals with Russian hotel owners.</p> <p>The Ukrainian Hotel and Resort Association has hit out at international hotel companies for not taking the “ethical stance” of Best Western, which removed its six Russian hotels from its website this month after sending a letter to its partners stating it was withdrawing from the country.</p> <p>US hotel group Hyatt said it had ended its “association, contracts and relationship” with a Hyatt Regency hotel in Moscow and “suspended the provision of services” to Hyatt Regency Sochi.</p> <p>Hotel groups have been slower than other consumer-facing companies to boycott Russia or downsize their operations amid international condemnation of its invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Retailers including H&amp;M and Nike have closed stores, while international brewers, such as Heineken and Carlsberg, are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd344ba7-eed4-45dc-858f-4ec423145c55\">divesting their Russian</a> divisions.</p> <p>The UHRA, which represents 130 hotel businesses in Ukraine, said hoteliers were “refusing to change their position in their continued operations in Russia” in order to “gratify shareholders” despite an escalation of the conflict. </p> <p>While all of the major groups have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88df6032-f831-48e0-8c9d-49076e6478eb\">halted development</a> of new hotels in Russia and opened up hotels to Ukrainian refugees, Ivan Loun, UHRA's international relations officer, said this was not enough. </p> <p>“There is a big part of the whole issue, which is morale, business ethics, human rights and international law. This is all the reasoning why they should be out,” he said. </p> <p>Accor, which operates 52 hotels in Russia, the most of any of the international chains, said it had terminated corporate clients and loyalty programme partners, but added that extricating itself from franchise deals was a challenge.</p> <p>A person with knowledge of Accor's Russian business said cutting ties with its corporate partners in Russia had already prompted “serious legal implications” for the group.</p> <p>Marriott and InterContinental Hotels Group, which both have more than 25 hotels in Russia, said they were reviewing contracts with Russian franchise partners and hotel owners, but said it was a “complicated” process.</p> <p>The UHRA said it had also received a “private notification” from Paris-based Louvre Hotels Group that it intended to “depart Russia soon”. Louvre did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Russian hotels branded under major chains including Marriott, Hilton and Radisson can still be booked through the companies' websites and apps, and using their loyalty points.</p> <p>“You simply should not be able to book a room on points — which is a room Marriott International is paying for — in Russia today, and yet with a few taps on the Bonvoy app, you can do just that,” said Gary Snyder, a consultant to several Marriott franchisees.</p> <p>Marriott said it was “committed to adhering to our legal obligations” but “for the time being” loyalty members could still use their points in Russia.</p> <p>Hoteliers argue that contracts drawn up with franchisees are more complicated and termination might not, in any case, be enforced in Russia even if the action was recognised as legal by European or US courts.</p> <p>The InterContinental Hotel in Kabul, for example, still carries the group's name despite IHG no longer operating in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The difficulty of curtailing pre-agreed contracts is also highlighted by Hyatt pushing ahead with the opening of a new hotel next month in Rostov-on-Don, a resort town near the Ukrainian border, despite ending operations at other Russian hotels.</p> <p>Hyatt said it was reviewing the contracts of unopened hotels. </p><p>Source: Alice Hancock 2022 'Hotel groups under renewed pressure to cut Russia contracts ' FT.com 25 April.
