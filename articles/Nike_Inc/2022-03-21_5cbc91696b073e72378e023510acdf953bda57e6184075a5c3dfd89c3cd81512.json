  "text": "<p>The U.S., by contrast, is less reliant on Russian oil, while counts of Covid-19 patients entering hospitals have fallen substantially. And many investors believe the U.S. economy entered the geopolitical tumult of recent weeks in strong enough shape to withstand the jump in oil prices and heightened anxiety sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 6.2% last week, its best performance since November 2020, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. The index is now up 5.6% since Russia invaded Ukraine and has trimmed its losses for the year to 6.4%.</p><p>The recent rally extends years of U.S. outperformance. Since the start of 2010, the S&amp;P 500 has quadrupled, while an MSCI index tracking stocks outside the U.S. is up about 30% over that time.</p><p>More recently, Germany's DAX index is down 1.5% since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. The Shanghai Composite has declined 6.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng has tumbled 9.5% over the same period.</p><p>\"The U.S. is a safe haven in an increasingly unsafe world,\" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, which was managing $1.6 trillion at the end of 2021.</p><p>This week, investors will look to a speech Monday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for further clues about the economic outlook. They also will parse earnings reports from Nike Inc., General Mills Inc. and Darden Restaurants Inc. to gauge the strength of the U.S. consumer.</p><p>The U.S.'s production of energy and agricultural products helps insulate it from the recent increases in commodities prices, while a strong U.S. labor market should support the domestic economy, Mr. McDonald said. Northern Trust has been buying U.S. stocks over the past month and selling shares from other parts of the world, he said.</p><p>The Chicago firm isn't alone. Money managers in recent weeks have shifted their appetites for regional equities, loading up on U.S. stocks and dropping shares of European companies. The net percentage of respondents to BofA Global Research's global fund manager survey who said they were overweight U.S. equities jumped 27 percentage points from February to March, returning the country's stocks to a net overweight position in the poll.</p><p>Overseas, it was a different story: The share of survey respondents who were overweight eurozone stocks dropped 48 percentage points to the largest underweight reading for that region since July 2012. Preferences for stocks in emerging markets, Japan and the U.K. also declined.</p><p>The conflict in Ukraine is expected to stress European economies as it strains supply chains and raises the cost of energy. Europe's economic recovery was less robust than that of the U.S. even before the invasion by Russia of Ukraine.</p><p>Atlanta-based wealth-management firm Homrich Berg is considering lowering its allocation to international equities and moving to short-term bonds because of the risk of economic slowdown outside the U.S., said chief investment officer Stephanie Lang.</p><p>\"We're not seeing the recession risk in the U.S.,\" she said. \"We are starting to see heightened recession risk globally. There's a bifurcation.\"</p><p>To be sure, some investors say that even with elevated geopolitical instability, stocks overseas trade at a steep enough discount to U.S. shares to merit consideration. The S&amp;P 500 traded last week at 19.2 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. Germany's DAX had a forward multiple of 12.7, while the Hang Seng traded at 10.1 times projected earnings.</p><p>\"I think most of the risks are actually priced into the international markets at this point,\" said Ben Kirby, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management.</p><p>Thornburg in recent weeks added to its positions in Dutch insurer NN Group NV and French oil-and-gas company TotalEnergies SE, he said.</p><p>U.S. equity funds saw their largest inflows in five weeks in the week ended Wednesday, while emerging markets equities had their first outflows since December and European equities recorded a fifth consecutive week of outflows, according to a BofA Global Research analysis of EPFR Global data.</p><p>The U.S. makes up about 60% of the MSCI ACWI All Cap Index, one measure of the global equity market.</p>",
