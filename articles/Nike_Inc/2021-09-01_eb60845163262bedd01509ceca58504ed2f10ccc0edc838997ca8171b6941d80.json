Manufacturing in China <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6c4d528-e699-4291-b05c-3ea01c620bbc\">shrank in August</a>, according to the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), an independent survey of factory activity. The recorded figure of 49.2 was the first time since April 2020 that the PMI had dropped below the 50-mark that separates monthly expansion from contraction.</p> <p>The index for China's services sector — announced yesterday — also plunged into negative territory as demand for such activity was dragged down by the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3aaf239c-0ee0-416a-a4c8-043d574e907c\">recent outbreak of Covid-19</a>&#xa0;in China, prompting expectations of monetary and fiscal stimulus from the state.</p> <p>Vietnam, which won praise for its early crackdown at the beginning of the pandemic last year, is now struggling to contain record levels of infection from the Delta variant, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca37cd50-056a-4a36-9673-49578e184403\">undermining the country's status as a manufacturing powerhouse</a>. </p> <p>Brands&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6726026-e4ce-466f-975f-6e9983d33d72\">including Nike and Adidas</a>&#xa0;have had their operations disrupted, highlighting Vietnam's growing role in global supply chains. Nikkei Asia now ranks Vietnam joint last, tied with Thailand in 120th place, on its Covid-19 Recovery index.</p> <p>In India, the pandemic is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ea25486-5b47-4a07-8d63-34e8d0dec208\">undermining its microfinance industry</a>. The expansion of credit in recent decades has allowed low-income Indians to take loans to pay for everything from dairy cows to new houses to job-creating small businesses. But the economic damage caused by Covid-19 means that many small business owners are now struggling to repay their debts, as the FT's report explains.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>The news about the economic impact of the Delta variant is little better elsewhere in the world. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec9d43ec-b625-4f5b-b48d-7ff8c91e3093#post-fdd78bb3-cd14-4616-ac6d-37dfb6ef8536\">Consumer confidence in the US has dropped</a> to its lowest level since February due to pessimism about this coronavirus strain. Concern about the spread of Covid-19 has led some Americans to seek out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c140ede-1b13-4b7f-ae8e-5a0a709b64be\">unofficial booster&#xa0;jabs</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b056e408-aabb-4f07-bf60-7b32e5e9a898\">borrowing fell to zero in July</a> as rising coronavirus infection rates sapped Britons' willingness to spend, with consumers instead choosing to add to their savings.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic punished Latin America, which accounts for 8 per cent of the world population but roughly one-third of global Covid-19 deaths. Now it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd043d8f-8a37-45e5-81fe-c4048317621b\">provoking an education crisis</a> in a region already rife with inequality and long a laggard in academic performance.</p> <p>It is better news for eastern Europe, according to&#xa0;Bernd Spalt, chief executive of Erste Group, Austria's biggest bank, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8068587f-f298-4684-8897-072b5fbc6952\">predicts that the region will recover faster</a> than western European nations. Austria's economy was hit harder by coronavirus than many of its EU neighbours. But its banking sector is well positioned to benefit from the recovery across the continent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f50584b-7656-4036-809a-f654fdc08c91?emailId=612f4b4d3172cc0004825269&amp;segmentId=13b7e341-ed02-2b53-e8c0-d9cb59be8b3b\">according to this piece by Austria and Switzerland correspondent Sam Jones</a>.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Zoom</strong>'s&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3473d52-1959-44e0-9d59-1d722a90845c\">plunging sales growth</a>&#xa0;is the latest sign that this pandemic winner could be hitting a wall. The video conferencing service's shares dropped nearly 10 per cent in after-market trading on Monday after it failed to lift its revenue guidance for the second half of its fiscal year, signalling an end to the soaring financial outperformance that made it one of the biggest corporate winners from the pandemic. It has suffered a near $60bn fall in its market value since last autumn.&#xa0;</p> <p>One company that continues to benefit from pandemic-fuelled changes is <strong>Amazon</strong>, whose capacity to air freight items to customers for next day delivery means that it could soon be in competition with the likes of UPS and FedEx, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec355eb5-8dbd-4293-9a21-46fc09d2ed2d\">according to a report</a>.</p> <p>Despite an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e66b8ec-0d6c-48f9-a8ec-a0d217d8ebb3\">upbeat forecast</a> from <strong>Ryanair</strong> chief executive Michael O'Leary about a recovery in civilian flights, for those in the travel industry, the bad pandemic-related news continues. </p> <p>Newsagent&#xa0;<strong>WHSmith</strong>&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/642ce5c4-3113-42bd-b310-146d7730d85e\">warned</a> that current year profit will be at the lower end of market expectations as its key travel markets remain slow to recover.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>The reports of manufacturing troubles in <strong>China</strong> did have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09798d7d-8aae-4ea5-83b7-eaba902ef321\">a positive impact on Asian stocks</a> as the PMI data raised hopes that policymakers in Beijing could take action to boost growth in the world's second-largest economy.<br><br><strong>Aluminium</strong> prices hit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a5e710-3cfc-40e6-90df-f524d0319be3\">highest levels in 10 years</a> yesterday as concerns grew about shortages in China, the world's biggest producer. The metal, which is used in cans, cars and construction, has risen by 50 per cent over the past year, adding further upward pressure to prices as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <h1>Essentials</h1> <p>Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine, who chairs the WHO Science Council, argues that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/342fd3c3-5a22-49a0-9cef-135f2ccd8700\">genomic sequencing</a> is not only crucial in tackling new coronavirus variants but will also help establish a technological “beachhead” to improve medical care and public health more generally.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>SimonJB</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93352268-cbb5-401d-a8d7-fcbb36587e1d?commentID=b2807118-efc5-4e4f-bc2e-dbe73a24befb\">UK law firms in legal quandary over Covid jabs as staff return to office</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>The return to the office is completely pointless anyway. Firms have not suffered any negative consequences as a result of remote working, in fact there have been huge benefits for staff which are about to be squandered due to a lack of creativity.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Vienna has changed hugely since Tony Barber lived there in the 1980s. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/953a70e7-4049-4f82-b1fb-b7af315588b9\">Don't miss his tribute</a> to the home of café culture which has become one of the most pleasant cities in the world in which to live.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Moules 2021 'Delta variant saps Asia's economic powerhouses' FT.com 1 September.
