  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>After an unparalleled tally of 27 gold medals, Japan rightly swelled with pride at the summer Olympics in Tokyo. One man, however, received the wooden spoon. Yoshihide Suga has decided not to run in his Liberal Democrat party's leadership elections, in effect ending his tenure as the country's prime minister. </p> <p>Japanese voters disagreed with his decision to push ahead with the Olympics. An initially chaotic start amid a surge of Covid-19 cases appeared to prove them right. The slow rollout of vaccinations did not help. Although the majority of Japanese now feel the Games were a success, Suga's poll ratings have not recovered. </p> <p>Suga became prime minister last year, succeeding marathon man Shinzo Abe — Japan's longest-serving prime minister. But investors seem to have no fear about the return of short-distance leaders. Share prices hit a 30-year peak on the news, adding a kick to Suga's booby prize. Shareholders think his replacement, any replacement, will do a better job.</p> <p>This burst in equity prices should please brokers at Japan's leading investment bank, Nomura. A new ruling against smoking while working may not. Eliminating cigarette breaks, even when working from home, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b08568f-49f8-418b-a670-17ad419aacd4\">would offer a serious test</a> for both workers and cigarette maker Japan Tobacco, thought Lex. </p> <p>Nomura will need all the happy, motivated salespersons it can get in order to market offerings to its ageing retail client base. SoftBank, for example, has plenty of bonds it needs to place.</p> <p>A ¥450bn ($4.1bn) sale of subordinated bonds due in 2028 is the biggest yen bond sale this year. Lex pointed out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d48b76c-f4d6-4053-8a21-3b9cc3137f1e\">just how indebted</a> this tech conglomerate has become. With Japanese retail investors holding a large chunk of SoftBank's shares and bonds, its dependence on Japan's brokerages is considerable. </p> <p>Investors sometimes rely on stock exchanges to act as advocates, placing demands on corporate behaviour on their behalf. That extends to board member positions, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Last month, it approved a move by the Nasdaq exchange that requires listed entities to have at least two “diverse” board members. Yet Nasdaq is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bae6654-50de-4366-bb0e-c248aeb7d718\">well behind the times</a>. Its targets look unambitious.</p> <p>Regulatory activism rightly stretches to greenwashing, too — the process of only appearing to follow environmentally sustainable investment guidelines. Recently, both the SEC and Germany's BaFin took swings at listed investment manager DWS, controlled by Deutsche Bank. A DWS probe should encourage more asset managers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/885b1c15-d64c-41b5-a203-f4b6dd5847e2\">watch their backs</a>, said Lex.</p> <p>Then again, sustainable investment must seek out enterprises with sustainable profitability, too. With equity markets on a roll and initial public offerings popular, eco-friendly shoemaker Allbirds has plans to list in the US. It has big backers, including investment fund heavyweights T Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton. Regardless, Allbirds spends so heavily to attract customers that its losses keep growing as sales balloon. Lex worried that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb5218c5-db96-41aa-9fcb-2f2d3be21080\">frothy valuation</a> might not incorporate the threat from well-established rivals such as Nike. </p> <p>New company listings are not the only sign of investor enthusiasm. Executive optimism has led to an increase in merger and acquisition activity. Almost every day brings a new deal announcement. </p> <p>Prosus, the Dutch investment arm of South Africa conglomerate Naspers, agreed the purchase of Indian payments system BillDesk this week for $4.7bn. The move by Prosus will expand its PayU basket of payments and fintech companies. This was a welcome start to the process of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c1c078c-1d97-4532-a8e8-98d20795ac78\">consolidating</a> in one industry, said Lex. </p> <p>Later in the week, private investors Advent and GIC put forward an all-cash offer for rare disease drugmaker Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi). This valued the group at SKr81bn (€7.9bn) including debts. But with the share price trading above the SKr235 per share offer price, Lex wondered whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62afd4f5-cc52-4105-a0a6-0a817e418ca6\">other buyers might appear</a>. Both Pfizer and Biogen have expressed interest in the past.</p> <p>No doubt dealmakers around the world will toil through the weekend on their next projects. Here's hoping that your own weekend is altogether quieter.</p> <p><strong>Alan Livsey</strong> <br><em>Lex Research Editor</em></p><p>Source: Alan Livsey 2021 'Best of Lex: all change in Japan' FT.com 3 September.
