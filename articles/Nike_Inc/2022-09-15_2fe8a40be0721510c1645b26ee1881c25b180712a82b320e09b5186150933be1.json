  "title": "Gap and Kanye West Are Ending Their Partnership; Designer says retailer hasn't opened promised stores and was too slow to make items available at brick-and-mortar locations",
  "text": "<p>Gap and Mr. West in 2020 announced a partnership to develop a collection of clothing under the Yeezy Gap brand. The rapper-and-designer has complained recently on social media about the arrangement and a similar deal he has with Adidas AG. </p><p>A Yeezy Gap jacket PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Jill Telesnicki</p><p>Items won't disappear from stores. Gap said it was still planning to release upcoming Yeezy Gap items in the pipeline, according to a memo sent Thursday to employees by Mark Breitbard, Gap brand president and CEO.</p><p>\"Simply put...while we share a vision of bringing high-quality, trend-forward, utilitarian design to all people through unique omni experiences with Yeezy Gap, how we work together to deliver this vision is not aligned,\" Mr. Breitbard wrote.</p><p>The music and fashion impresario, known as Ye, has taken to social media to criticize Gap for allegedly copying his designs and cutting him out of the creative process. In a video clip posted on Instagram in late August, Mr. West told a group of Gap executives: \"You have to really give me the position to be Ye and let me do what I'm thinking, or I have to do the thinking somewhere else.\"</p><p>Mr. West, who has also publicly criticized Adidas on social media, had talked about wanting to partner with Gap in various interviews over the years before inking his deal with the San Francisco company. The deal provided for Mr. West to earn royalties and potential equity based on meeting sales targets.</p><p>More recently, he has talked about opening his own retail stores. \"We are going to open Yeezy stores worldwide. Starting in Atlanta,\" Mr. West said in an Instagram post in late August.</p><p>Gap was required to sell 40% of the Yeezy Gap assortment in brick-and-mortar retail stores during the third and fourth quarters of 2021, according to the letter, which was signed by Nicholas Gravante Jr., a partner with Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP.</p><p>The first item, a Yeezy Gap hoodie, went on sale in the fall of 2021, but it was available only on Gap's website.</p><p>It wasn't until the French luxury house Balenciaga got involved that products under the name Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga made their debut in stores in July 2022.</p><p>A new batch of Yeezy Gap products is scheduled to arrive in stores for the coming fall and holiday season, according to the company. The Yeezy Gap items will be priced under $100, in contrast with the more expensive Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga products.</p><p>Gap was also required under the agreement to open as many as five retail stores dedicated to showcasing Yeezy Gap products by July 31, 2023, according to the letter. To date, Gap hasn't opened a dedicated store, the letter contends.</p><p>Mr. West's 10-year deal with Adidas, which runs through 2026, is also fraying. The German sportswear giant and its executives have faced criticism for months from Mr. West, ranging from accusations of stealing his designs from his Yeezy brand to not fulfilling their contract obligations.</p><p>\"It's going to cost you billions to keep me. It's going to cost you billions to let me go,\" Mr. West said in an Instagram post that has since been deleted.</p><p>An Adidas spokesman declined to comment. Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in August that Mr. West was probably the most important partner the company had.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you shop at Gap? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The two parties have been in conversations for the past week, and Adidas is trying to find a path toward continuing the partnership, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. West has long held ambitions to affect fashion the way he has put his imprint on music. In 2009, he interned at the Italian fashion house Fendi. As recently as 2018, he had hoped to become artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear, a job that went to his friend Virgil Abloh, who died of cancer in November.</p><p>Before collaborating with Adidas, Mr. West joined forces with Nike Inc., where he released the coveted Nike Air Yeezy II. His high-end line of Yeezy sneakers for Adidas are released in limited quantities and quickly sell out. Gap said the Yeezy Gap hoodie delivered the most sales by an item in a single day on its website when it made its debut.</p><p>The Yeezy Gap partnership showed signs of trouble early on. In September 2020, Mr. West threatened to withhold the line until he was given a board seat. He made similar demands about joining Adidas's board.</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Gap and Kanye West Are Ending Their Partnership</p>",
