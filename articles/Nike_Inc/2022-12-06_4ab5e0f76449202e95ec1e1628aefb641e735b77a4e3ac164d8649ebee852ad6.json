  "title": "A Clarification From the Capitol Riot Committee; The chairman makes it even harder to take this work seriously.",
  "text": "<p>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol will issue criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on its inquiry, the panel's chairman said on Tuesday, but has made no decision on who it will recommend charging or what offenses it will cite.</p><p>Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill that the panel had agreed to take the step and would meet later Tuesday to discuss the specifics. But within moments, he and his staff rushed to clarify his statement, reflecting a debate that is still underway within the panel about whether to call for charges against former President Donald J. Trump and some of his top allies.</p><p>What was clearly needed was not a clarification but a retraction. Americans reasonably expect their government to identify a specific crime before suggesting charges. But it seems the \"clarification\" simply clarified the outrageous approach pursued by this sham committee which consists only of Democrats and Democrat-approved Republicans. Mr. Broadwater of the Times continues:</p><p>\"What we've decided is that we will probably make referrals,\" Mr. Thompson told reporters a short time later.</p><p>Mr. Thompson, who is known for giving big-picture guidance about the investigation but being at times less involved in the granular details of its work, then suggested that that decision was no longer in question.</p><p>\"There's a general agreement we will do some referrals, but we've got to get there,\" he said. \"We're not there yet.\"</p><p>Is this committee so political and partisan that it first decided that criminal referrals are necessary to advance its agenda, and only now has set about trying to figure out little details like who should be targeted for prosecution by Biden Justice and on what basis?</p><p>Some readers might assume that something has been garbled by the New York Times but the Journal's Scott Patterson also reports on Mr. Thompson's comments:</p><p>\"We've not made a decision as to who, but we have made decisions that criminal referrals will happen,\" he said.</p><p>So we are told that criminal prosecutions must commence, with alleged offenses and alleged perpetrators to be determined later. Sounds like a fascinating plot premise for the television producer Democrats hired to make the committee a prime-time smash. Too bad that last month U.S. voters decided to cancel season two.</p><p>***</p><p>Annals of Socialized Medicine Anyone still thinking that \"Medicare for All\" is an appealing idea should examine the availability and quality of care in government-run universal health systems around the world. Over in the United Kingdom, Kat Lay and Chris Smyth report today for The Times of London:</p><p>Five million patients were unable to book a GP appointment when they tried to make one in October, analysis has suggested.</p><p>Problems with access to family doctors will drive patients to accident &amp; emergency and exacerbate pressure on hospitals, campaigners said yesterday.</p><p>Another two million people faced a wait of more than a month to see their doctor, the highest number since the records began, in 2017, and 4.3 million waited for more than a fortnight.</p><p>***</p><p>No Immunity? Lahav Harkov reports in the Jerusalem Post:</p><p>Israeli Consul-General in Shanghai Eddie Shapira was held in a medical facility for 10 days, as part of China's zero-COVID policy, he wrote on Facebook over the weekend.</p><p>Shapira said the \"conditions are reminiscent of a prison,\" and that he experienced \"the 10 most bizarre days that I could imagine.\"</p><p>The diplomat caught COVID-19 with mild symptoms, he recounted.</p><p>\"The problem is that I caught it in the wrongest place on earth - in China,\" Shapira wrote.</p><p>***</p><p>End of a Media Era Devan Cole reports for CNN:</p><p>Disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti was sentenced Monday to 14 years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $11 million in restitution for embezzling millions of dollars from four of his clients and obstruction...</p><p>The sentence handed down by federal district Judge James Selna will begin after Avenatti completes a five-year prison term he's currently serving after being convicted in two separate trials in New York... The prison sentence Avenatti is currently serving was given after he was convicted for attempting to extort millions of dollars from Nike and stealing nearly $300,000 from a book advance from [Stormy Daniels], his then-client...</p><p>...Avenatti admitted to stealing millions of dollars from clients, including $4 million from a client with major disabilities.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.
