  "title": "Nike Cuts  Ties to  NBA Star  Irving Over  Remarks  ----  By Inti Pacheco",
  "text": "<p>    Nike Inc. has cut ties with Kyrie Irving, ending an endorsement deal with the basketball star in place for more than a decade, a partnership that resulted in a sneaker line that was popular with professional athletes and consumers. </p><p>   The brief statement Monday from the sneaker giant comes after it suspended its endorsement of Mr. Irving in early November and the release of the Kyrie 8, a sneaker model that had been expected to make its debut later that month. Nike decided to take action against Mr. Irving after he promoted a movie containing false conspiracy theories about Jews and was slow to disavow holding anti-Semitic beliefs. The Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association also suspended Mr. Irving at the time. </p><p>   In a statement last month, Nike said there was no place for hate speech at the company and condemned any form of anti-Semitism. \"We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the situation and its impact on everyone,\" the company said. </p><p>   Mr. Irving, 30 years old, has apologized for his actions and said that promoting the documentary, \"Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America,\" was a mistake. He has said that he opposes all forms of hatred and oppression. The former All-Star guard returned to the basketball court in late November after missing eight games. </p><p>   A representative for Mr. Irving didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   The Athletic earlier reported on Nike's status with Mr. Irving. </p><p>   The sneaker company has footwear deals with other NBA players, including LeBron James and Mr. Irving's teammate Kevin Durant. </p><p></p>",
