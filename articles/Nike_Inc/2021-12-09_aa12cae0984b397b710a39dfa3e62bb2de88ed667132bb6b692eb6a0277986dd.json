  "text": "<p>Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has said it is on course to report its highest ever profit this year after a strong recovery in first-half trading and indicated it is ready to make more acquisitions.</p> <p>The UK retail group said on Thursday that full-year adjusted pre-tax profit would be in a range of £300m-350m, the first guidance it has given for this year. Its previous record underlying profit of £300m came in 2015.</p> <p>Last year it made just £5.8m, as many of its stores were forced to close and it booked heavy impairment charges. </p> <p>The group, which includes the Sports Direct chain, House of Fraser department stores and luxury apparel retailer Flannels, reported a 23 per cent rise in sales to £2.34bn in the half-year to October 24. </p> <p>Chris Wootton, chief financial officer, said the performance partly reflected weak comparatives, with most of its stores closed for around a quarter of the same period last year, but that trading momentum had been strong. Pre-tax profits rose 75 per cent to £187m.</p> <p>Strong cash flow meant that net debt fell from more than £200m to just £24m, though the company recently arranged a new £930m credit facility. “That's about having firepower to go and do things if and when opportunities come up,” said Wootton.</p> <p>Michael Murray, Ashley's future son-in-law who will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04701740-935f-4c16-8d14-d6346b0ae5d2\">takeover from him as chief executive</a> next year, has already indicated that the group plans to expand its sportswear franchise in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34364f12-1094-4996-a919-fb6f845b28ce\">including through acquisitions</a>.</p> <p>Most of the increase in profits and sales was generated by the core UK sports operation, where Frasers has been refitting stores in key cities to give them a more aspirational ambience and working with brands, like Nike and Adidas in particular, to secure the latest footwear releases.</p> <p>Sales in that division rose 27 per cent to £1.37bn — almost three-fifths of the total, with underlying profit more than doubling to £117m. Wootton said the company was hit less hard by HGV driver shortages as it employs most of its drivers directly and was able to increase wages to retain them.</p> <p>He added that the group was well set for Christmas, but remained cautious about further trading restrictions and pressure on incomes among younger consumers.</p> <p>The rollout of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ae74fbd-bc7e-457a-8354-b1d53cef5a5e\">more Flannels stores</a> boosted sales in the premium lifestyle division, and Wootton said that online sales were above last year despite the lack of store closures in the first half of the current year. </p> <p>But the division slipped back into a loss as the group booked impairment charges, mostly against House of Fraser department stores. Two more stores closed in the period and the flagship on Oxford Street will close in the new year.</p> <p>The group has acquired a site in Bitburg, Germany for a new warehouse. It will be around a third of the size of its Shirebrook campus in the UK but will be highly automated and supply stores in Europe and fulfil ecommerce orders. </p> <p>Rival JD Sports is also investing in European distribution facilities, partly to circumvent the Brexit-related bureaucracy around importing goods from third countries into the UK and then re-exporting to the single market.</p> <p>Analysts at Liberum, which acts as corporate broker, said the results were “standout considering the current environment” and raised its target price to 900p.</p> <p>Shares in the FTSE 250 group were up 2 per cent at 732p in early trade, and have risen by almost two-thirds over the past year. </p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Frasers Group points to record profit of more than £300m' FT.com 9 December.
