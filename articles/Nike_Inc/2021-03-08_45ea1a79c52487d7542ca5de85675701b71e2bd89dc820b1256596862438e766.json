  "text": "<p>\n  KAWS: What Party </p><p>\n  Brooklyn Museum, through Sept. 5 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Brooklyn, N.Y. -- What happens when an outsider artist becomes completely, unabashedly mainstream? One answer can be found in \"KAWS: What Party,\" the new exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum featuring works created by the graffiti writer turned consumer darling over his 25-year career. </p><p>\n  KAWS, born Brian Donnelly in 1974 in Jersey City, N.J., attended the School of Visual Arts in New York and spent the early part of his career working as an animator while tagging trains, billboards, advertisements and more in his free time. In 1997, he traveled to Tokyo and learned about otaku, essentially ultrafans, especially those obsessed with anime and manga, and began to see popular cartoon characters as an outlet for cross-cultural communication. Fast forward to 2019, when his painting \"The Kaws Album,\" a tweaked version of the cover art for \"The Yellow Album\" -- a record of original songs recorded by characters from \"The Simpsons\" -- that itself was a parody of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper\" cover, sold for $14.8 million at Sotheby's in Hong Kong. </p><p>\n  Along the way he developed a signature motif (X-ing out the eyes of his various subjects), a personal logo (a cartoonish skull and crossbones with those X-ed out eyes), and several characters who are now synonymous with his work, the best known of which is Companion, a creature with a Mickey Mouse body and skull-and-bones head. In the process, he's created affordable toy versions of his works and partnered with brands ranging from Nike to Kiehl's to Hennessy. </p><p>\n  Which is all to say the Brooklyn Museum had its work cut out for it in planning this exhibition. Not only would it need to trace the arc of a meteoric career, from spray-can wielder to corporate-partnership dealer, but also to explain why work that, on its surface, can seem repetitive, simplistic and uninspired has been welcomed by such odd bedfellows as high-end gallerists, brand marketing teams and trend-chasing sneakerheads. </p><p>\n  Unfortunately, for those who see Mr. Donnelly's empyrean status less as the result of an Immaculate Kawnception and more as another harbinger of Artistic Kawpocalypse, the show will do little to change previous notions about him or his art. </p><p>\n  Arranged thematically across six sections, the show starts on a bullish note, with his early work: Sketchbooks planning his graffiti pieces and photos of the end results give you a real sense of the excitement and precision that went into the large-scale murals that seemed to appear as if by magic overnight around urban spaces. And a selection of old advertisements that he spirited away from their displays around New York, altered and then returned with bright and cartoonish characters overlaid on or intertwined with the ad models are a wry co-optation of public space and a gentle ribbing of consumerism. Especially clever is an ad featuring Keith Haring, himself drawing on a blacked-out subway ad, to which KAWS has added a creature that is wrapped around Haring's torso, staring over his shoulder. All of this is evidence of a young artist actively engaged with his media and firmly rooted in the history of his chosen field, namely street art. </p><p>\n  From there, though, the thread gets lost -- both that of KAWS's development and of the story the exhibition is trying to tell. The next section explores his appropriation of cartoon characters, with a focus on the Simpsons (his X-eyed version of the classic clan is called the \"Kimpsons\"), but what fills the gap from guerrilla beginnings to works sold in clamshell packaging like action figures? We occasionally hear from the artist in wall labels -- \"I do start with familiar things and that's primarily to make the work more approachable for people\" -- but other than vague appeals to universality and readability, it's unclear what, exactly, this kind of appropriation is supposed to accomplish. A series of close-up paintings of characters' heads that make reference to landscapes are the most interesting here, studies in color and form that point in directions that even Josef Albers could have been interested in, but what comes of them? If there were later explorations, they aren't to be found in the show. And that album cover, like a photocopy reproduced too many times, fades into insignificance. </p><p>\n  The trend continues with the later sections. A Smurf in noxious clouds. Snoopy clipped at odd angles. SpongeBob looking like he's in the middle of a bad trip. Plays on the Michelin Man, Bugs Bunny and Gumby. All are easily identified, and all go down easier than a Bud Light at a barbecue, but to what end? These are works made to be recognizable solely for recognition's sake -- artistic empty calories so focused on reaching everyone that they're substantially satisfying to no one, the latest offering in the saccharine but successful mold best exemplified by Jeff Koons. </p><p>\n  That's not to say there's anything inherently bad about art that repurposes popular imagery: The lineage of commercial appropriation has its roots in Duchamp and Warhol, without whose influence the contemporary art world would be unimaginable. But there's a difference: They used consumerism to make us think about the products that are regularly sold, whereas KAWS blithely trafficks in them. </p><p>\n  Hence a KAWS toy to suit every taste, fandom and subgroup: Astroboy, Darth Vader, the MTV Moonman, and more -- many offered in affordable, open editions so you, too, can own a work by one of the buzziest names today. Say what you will about the work, but it's undeniable that KAWS remains staunchly, unapologetically, populist. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Kelly is the Journal's associate Arts in Review editor.
