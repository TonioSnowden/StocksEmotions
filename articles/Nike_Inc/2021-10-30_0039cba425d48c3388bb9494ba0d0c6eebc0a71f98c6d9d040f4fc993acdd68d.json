  "text": "<p>Foxconn Technology Group, which supplies Apple Inc., said its facilities in Vietnam are operating normally.</p><p>On Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that while Covid-19 disruptions in Southeast Asia contributed to the company's supply-chain issues in the most recent quarter, they have \"improved materially across October to where we currently are.\" Mr. Cook acknowledged that despite improvements, the situation remains unpredictable. In its latest earnings report, Apple pointed to the situation in Southeast Asia as a bottleneck, saying that pandemic disruptions had contributed to a $6 billion hit to potential revenue.</p><p>Other major brands, including Nike Inc. and Adidas AG, had earlier said their supply chains were hurt during a Covid-19 wave that swept the region this summer.</p><p>While the decline in cases, along with easing restrictions on factories, means that a major contributor to global supply delays is set to ease, problems including labor shortages mean it could take weeks or months for manufacturing to be fully restored in some places.</p><p>An employee of a large American apparel company said supplier factories in Vietnam had around three-quarters of their workers back. One technician for a shoe factory in southern Vietnam said the factory was now operating with 4,000 of its 7,000 workers, and expected to restore full production by November.</p><p>Factories in Malaysia have largely reopened, after the government implemented new policies in August allowing manufacturers with highly vaccinated workforces to progressively return to normal production.</p><p>One closely watched industry is Malaysia semiconductors.</p><p>Tight restrictions on factory production in Malaysia earlier this year cut into global semiconductor manufacturing, as the country is a major hub for chip packaging. That caused downstream effects, including to car makers, which were short on chips. Demand for semiconductors remains high, however, and supply will remain tight in the months to come.</p><p>Wong Siew Hai, president of the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association, said manufacturing in the country has improved immensely over the past few months, as most factories have vaccinated almost all of their staff and are back at full capacity. The semiconductor sector faces challenges meeting ever-increasing demand, however, and many Malaysian manufacturers are now focused on expanding operations by 10%-20% over the next year to ease supply strains.</p><p>\"We're not quite at pre-Covid levels. It'll take some time, maybe six months to a year,\" Mr. Wong said. \"With capacity increases, things will be even better than before.\"</p><p>Another continuing concern is labor shortages, and getting migrant workers back to factory floors. Peter Mumford, Southeast Asia practice head for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm, said that more than a million workers from southern Vietnam are estimated to have returned to their hometowns between July and September, with several hundred thousand more heading back after the recent reopening.</p>",
