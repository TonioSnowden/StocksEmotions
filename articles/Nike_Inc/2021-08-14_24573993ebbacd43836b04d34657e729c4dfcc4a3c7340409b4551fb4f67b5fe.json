  "text": "<p>Though the Olympic race was only the third time the runner had attempted a full marathon distance, something special did happen: She became the third U.S. woman to ever claim an Olympic marathon medal.</p><p>\"Seeing Molly on that podium was amazing, because at the end of the day she's just a normal person -- but she's doing incredible things,\" the coach said.</p><p>The good news for real \"just normal\" runners: It's easier than ever to channel our inner Olympians. A gaggle of gadgets to help push us further and faster are increasingly accessible, thanks to rapid advances in wearable technology.</p><p>\"Good athletes know that success comes from many different factors -- from running and recovery to the technology you use to support your routine,\" said superstar New York City runner Mary Cain, who at 17 became the youngest American athlete to make a World Championships team.</p><p>\"One of the most beautiful things about this sport is that everybody is starting in different places and at different speeds,\" added Ms. Cain, now 25 and spending her days running Atalanta NYC, a nonprofit that supports professional female runners. \"There is always something new to learn and try.\"</p><p>Whether you're pinning on a race number for marathon season this fall or simply pinning your hopes on the running habit's actually sticking this time, here are expert-recommended new gadgets to solve some common issues runners come across (medal ceremony kit optional).</p><p>My hips often hurt after a run, and I'm worried my running style is to blame. Is there anything that can help me run more smoothly?</p><p>-- Blish Connor, 45, Kansas City, Mo.</p><p>\"A strong stride looks like it's flowing in a forward direction,\" said Ms. Cain. \"You don't want your hips to move too much when your feet strike the ground.\" Try clipping the compact Garmin Running Dynamics Pod to your waistband to help correct your form. As you run, the device pairs to a companion app on your phone to record six metrics -- from stride length to vertical \"bounce\" -- to identify problems and smooth your gait. $70, buy.garmin.com</p><p>I'd like to beat my half marathon time by the end of the year. How can I improve my speed in competitive races?</p><p>-- Letty Esparza, 42, Fort Worth, Texas</p><p>The ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT% 2s are Nike's fastest mainstream models yet. The shoes use a propulsive carbon plate that thrusts you forward with every stride, plus a super-light chassis with improved traction. But don't lace them up every time you train: Carbon plates should be used primarily for racing, according to Mr. Green, who noted that frequent use can cause foot weakness over time. Practice in a pair without carbon but with the same bouncy foam. $250, nike.com</p><p>\"I'm training for a half marathon but can't get to the gym as often as I'd like.

It's a great way to track data and incredibly helpful as a training tool.\" Free to download, additional training plans from $25, finalsurge.com</p><p>Motivation is my issue. I'm happiest running to music but struggle to find earbuds that stay in.</p><p>-- Alistair Weaver, 44, Manhattan Beach, Calif.</p><p>Aftershokz Aeropex bone-conductor headphones sit snugly on your cheekbones instead of in your ears, so they won't slip out mid-run. They'll also keep you safely aware of noises in your surroundings while pumping out motivational tunes -- which can in fact increase your pace by 5% while reducing fatigue by 15%, according to Prof. Costas Karageorghis of the U.K.'s Brunel University. $160, us.aftershokz.com</p><p>I founded a hill-running club, and my calves and hamstrings aren't happy about it. How can I minimize the aches and pains the following day?</p><p>-- Tom Purves, 42, Rhinebeck, N.Y.</p><p>Released last October, the Polar Vantage V2 running watch will help you crush any gradient. The touch-screen device can measure your pulse to calculate your exact cardio load, helping you avoid overtaxing different parts of your body by telling you when to speed up and when to take it easy. It will also walk you through the optimal rest and recovery strategies so you sidestep tomorrow's calf inferno.

Is there an easier fix than buying a cooling vest?</p><p>-- Hayley Dyer, 33, Austin Texas</p><p>The Embr Labs Wave 2 is a far more unobtrusive solution than running around Lady Bird Lake in an ice vest. The intelligent wearable, designed by MIT grads, looks like a watch but lowers your body temperature rapidly with targeted cooling sensations on your inner wrist -- a techier version of holding an ice cube on your pressure points. Downshift your temperature by up to 9 degrees via the companion app or raise it up to 6 in cold months. $349, embrlabs.com</p>",
