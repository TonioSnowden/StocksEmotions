  "text": "<p>   A handful of executives inside Adidas headquarters in Germany privately worried about the same thing. While they had acquired the rights to one of the most talented soccer players in the world, they fretted that their new pitchman might have all the charisma of a silent film star. The shy kid who had bawled for the entire flight from Argentina to Spain at age 12 was now a shy 18-year-old who barely looked like an athlete. Left to his own devices, he fed himself with pizza and Coca-Cola. His jersey billowed around him like he had borrowed it. Mr. Messi hardly knew where the Barcelona weight room was. </p><p>   Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer didn't seem worried about it. Poaching Mr. Messi from Nike was a coup so momentous that he highlighted it in the middle of the company's earnings call that May. Top of the company's list of recent achievements, he said -- ahead of selling 15 million soccer balls and 750,000 pairs of boots -- was \"the signing of the world's top-ranked footballer under 21 from Argentina . . . who many claim has the potential to be the next Maradona.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   This article is adapted from the book \"Messi vs. Ronaldo: One Rivalry, Two GOATs, and the Era That Remade the World's Game,\" by The Wall Street Journal's Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg, to be published on Nov. 1 by Mariner Books, an imprint of HarperCollins (which, like the Journal, is owned by News Corp). </p><p></p>",
