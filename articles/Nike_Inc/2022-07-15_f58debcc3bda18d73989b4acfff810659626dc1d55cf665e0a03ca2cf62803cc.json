  "title": "China Reports Slowest Growth in Two Years",
  "text": "<p>The scale of the slowdown highlights the damage caused by stringent lockdowns that left millions of Shanghai residents confined to their homes for two months and many businesses closed as authorities tried to snuff out a coronavirus outbreak in China's wealthiest city.</p><p>Lockdowns weren't confined to China's prosperous coast: Outbreaks have also closed car factories and disrupted farming in the northern province of Jilin and pummeled activity in other towns and cities. The shutdowns had strangled consumer demand and business activity, resulting in the cratering of retail sales and industrial production.</p><p>On a quarter-to-quarter basis, China's economy shrank 2.6%, marking only the second such contraction since comparable records began in 2010.</p><p>Official data show a modest recovery is now under way, sparked by the easing of public-health restrictions, which has released pent-up demand for Chinese goods and services. But already, there are warning signals about the labor market, and from business and consumer surveys.</p><p>Even with some postlockdown recovery, China is on course for a low-growth year, economists say. Unemployment is stubbornly high, real estate is slumping and exports are likely to weaken as Western economies shift into lower gear. Youth unemployment hit a record in June, with 19.3% of workers aged 16 to 24 out of work.</p><p>A feeble year for China would deprive the global economy of a dependable engine of expansion when rising interest rates and soaring inflation are squeezing growth in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>\"If other important parts of the global economy remain weak or go into recession, it seems highly unlikely that China can become a locomotive for global growth as was the case after the global financial crisis,\" said Jonathan Ashworth, senior China economist in London at Fathom Consulting.</p><p>Beijing this year set a goal of expanding around 5.5% in 2022 as a whole, a target that looks increasingly out of reach. Most economists think it might muster about 4%.</p><p>Most of the second-quarter hit was concentrated in April, when lockdowns were at their most widespread. Retail sales plunged by an annual 11.1% in April as stores closed and shoppers stayed home, according to data already published. Industrial production shrank 2.9% as factories fell idle.</p><p>Sportswear maker Nike Inc. said 60% of its business in China was affected by lockdowns during its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31. Executives told analysts on an earnings call that fourth-quarter revenue fell 20% from a year earlier after adjusting for currency fluctuations, while earnings before interest and taxes fell 55%.</p><p>China lifted restrictions in most areas by May, though Shanghai stayed under lockdown until the beginning of June. The reopening helped some economic activity recover: Exports surged in May and again in June as factories reopened and ports cleared a backlog of orders.</p><p>Data released on Friday showed retail sales rose an annual 3.1% in June, bouncing back from a 6.7% fall the previous month. Industrial production also recovered after lockdowns eased, rising an annual 3.9% in June after a 0.7% expansion in May.</p><p>For some businesses, the disruptions persisted beyond the shutdowns. Roy Huang, who runs fiber-optic equipment maker Shenzhen DYS Fiber Optic Technology Co., said that even after the southern city of Shenzhen exited from a lockdown in March, workers still couldn't return to his factory because of travel restrictions.</p><p>\"Our production was greatly affected by the epidemic,\" said Mr. Huang, who estimates his capacity fell by half between February and April. His profit was also squeezed by rising costs for transport and raw materials, he said.</p><p>Fixed-asset investment rose 6.1% year on year in the first half, down slightly from a 6.2% increase in the January-May period. China is in the grips of a real-estate slump as developers struggle with heavy debts, and a planned infrastructure boost hasn't yielded big benefits.</p><p>Exports, which powered China out of its first Covid-19 slump in 2020 and again in 2021, grew strongly in May and June as cities reopened. But overseas demand for Chinese goods and services is expected to weaken as Western consumer spending slows.</p><p>Already, data from export powerhouses such as Taiwan and South Korea suggest foreign demand for manufactured goods is starting to fade. In China, business surveys showed that a gauge of manufacturers' export orders in June remained below a threshold that signals order books are expanding rather than shrinking.</p><p>Above all, economists say a pandemic policy in which any Covid-19 outbreak is to be smothered with sharp restrictions on daily life means that consumers are hesitant to spend and businesses are nervous about investing and hiring. An index of consumer confidence in China was down 29% in May compared with January.</p><p>Unemployment in urban China eased in June, data Friday showed, to 5.5%, from 5.9% previously. But joblessness among workers aged 16 to 24 rose, reaching 19.3%, from 18.4% in May. That is the highest reading since comparable records began in 2018. Economists and policy makers fret about youth unemployment because it can have long-term effects on workers' skills and productivity, which can squeeze an economy's potential for growth.</p><p>Katrina Ell, a senior economist on China at Moody's Analytics, said the high rate of youth joblessness suggests firms aren't willing to take on new staff and invest in training amid the uncertainty created by the government's zero-Covid approach. \"There's an ongoing reluctance to invest in the future,\" she said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
