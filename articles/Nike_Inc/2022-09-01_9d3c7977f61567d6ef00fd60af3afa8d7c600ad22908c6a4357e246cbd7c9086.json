  "title": "Serena Williams wins again at U.S. Open, but really, can she ever lose? Serena Williams is retiring from tennis to focus on family — and her venture-capital firm — but can't stop winning at the U.S. Open",
  "text": "<p>\"It's no rush here…there's still a little left in me, we'll see,\" she said at the post-match press conference.</p><p>But even if Williams had lost her match, she planned to keep winning.</p><p>According to the retirement letter she released earlier this month, instead of smashing 128.6-mph serves, Williams wants be an early investor in the next Uber UBER or Snap SNAP.</p><p>She said she wants to build a burgeoning business empire and may end up becoming the first female billionaire in sports history.</p><p>Having already made a robust $94 million strictly from tennis tournaments over the years, and another $350 million from her off-court endorsements, according to Sportico, Williams is nearly halfway there — she has brand deals with companies including Nike NKE, AT&amp;T T and Gatorade.</p><p>Williams mentioned her venture-capital firm, Serena Ventures, as one of her post-tennis focuses. The firm has already raised $111 million since its inception in 2014 and aims to find \"early-stage companies\" — according to Serena Ventures' website, 76% of the companies in its portfolio are from under-represented founders, 53% are from women founders and 47% have Black founders.</p><p>Other athletes, including NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, have made notably smart investing moves in recent years. James was an early investor in headphones company \"Beats by Dre\" and Durant was an early investor in Coinbase COIN and Postmates.</p><p>Serena Ventures has already made investments in MasterClass, Impossible Foods and Noom, along with 53 other companies.</p><p>\"I like to invest in things where I believe in the founder\" she told the Wall Street Journal. \"For us, it's really about the founder and 'do we like the company?' and does the founder have a good story and 'why is he doing it?' Is it because it's a white space, or is it really solving a problem that is close to his or her heart?\"</p><p>Since the announcement, Williams has done her best to avoid saying the word \"retire\" in favor of other words, like \"evolve.\"</p><p>\"But I'm not retiring, I'm just evolving away from tennis and doing something else,\" she told the Journal. \"I probably should retire, for a few years at least, but for some inane reason I'm not.\"</p><p>Serena isn't done with her tennis journey just yet, but if she doesn't win her next match on Friday, it doesn't matter. Serena Williams can't really lose.</p><p>Serena Williams wins again at U.S. Open, but really, can she ever lose?</p>",
