  "text": "<p>Europe's biggest shoe retailer is looking to expand its UK footprint and believes it could double its estate of 109 stores as it seeks to become the market leader in “family footwear”.</p> <p>Deichmann, a privately held German group famed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd862112-20e3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">for its philanthropy</a>, boasts annual sales approaching €6bn. But despite a 20-year presence in the UK it has only a small market share, with its latest accounts, for 2019, showing revenue of just £104m.</p> <p>“We are very keen on the UK as one of Europe's largest markets,” said Samuel Deichmann, the great grandson of the chain's founder and who is now running its UK operation. “We see a lot of potential here . . . we want to be the market leader in family footwear like we are in many central and eastern European countries”.</p> <p>The 28-year-old was reluctant to specify a target for store numbers or market share and played down comparisons with German supermarkets Aldi and Lidl, which expanded cautiously in the UK for two decades before opening hundreds of new stores after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>“We don't want to do anything reckless,” he said, adding that “we are a family-owned company that thinks in generations, not quarters”. Like many private German businesses, Deichmann is wary of taking on debt to expand.</p> <p>But he said he saw “no reason in the medium to long term” why the store estate could not double in size, pointing out that in its home market Deichmann has more than 1,000 stores and is approaching 200 even in relatively small countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p> <p>The group has been “fine-tuning” its offering for the UK market, which has been upended by the growing trend towards more casual and less formal dressing, compounded by increased working from home and higher levels of ecommerce during the pandemic.</p> <p>“Athleisure” chains JD Sports and Sports Direct now account for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a65bafc-4480-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd\">about a quarter</a> of UK footwear sales, according to GlobalData, with Primark and Amazon also among the top five retailers.</p> <p>Others are retrenching. Clarks still has far more stores than Deichmann but used an insolvency process <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30072572-5241-4bcf-9fa7-918b3127bdd6\">to reduce its estate</a>, while budget operator Shoe Zone has closed 88 stores in the past 18 months and specialist Hotter has also switched to an online-focused model.</p> <p>Deichmann said this would “offer us the chance to settle in locations abandoned by rivals”, adding that landlords were showing increased flexibility and that the group was now present in upmarket locations such as the two Westfield malls in London.</p> <p>Like Clarks, Deichmann designs many of its own ranges but its pan-European scale also gives it strong relationships with third-party brands such as Skechers, Adidas, Nike and Puma, and access to exclusive product lines at entry-level prices.</p> <p>Its stores operate a “rack room” system where almost all a shop's available stock is on display, a contrast to many others in the sector that are trying to limit inventory held in-store to reduce working capital.</p> <p>Despite the focus on stores, Deichmann said the group was also committed to online sales.</p> <p>The company is fitting out a new distribution centre that will serve both stores and home delivery, and expects to take lessons from the UK — where ecommerce penetration is relatively high — to other markets. </p> <p>“Our ambition is to be best-in-class in both channels,” he said.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Europe's biggest shoe shop chain looks to expand in UK' FT.com 16 August.
