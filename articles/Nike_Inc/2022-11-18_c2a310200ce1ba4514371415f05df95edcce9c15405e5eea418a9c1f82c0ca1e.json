  "title": "'The Last Folk Hero' Review: Bo Jackson's Remarkable Run; A three-sport phenom in high school, Bo Jackson gave up track to pour himself into a brief, stellar career in both the NFL and MLB.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Jackson's eye-popping destruction of his equipment offers a neat encapsulation of the theme of \"The Last Folk Hero: The Life and Myth of Bo Jackson,\" Jeff Pearlman's exuberant biography of the two-sport phenom: namely that Bo Jackson was superhuman, boasting, in Mr. Pearlman's words, \"an unparalleled blending of size, speed, power and hustle\" that awed onlookers. Mr. Pearlman—the author of nine previous books, including biographies of Roger Clemens and Walter Payton—credits the book's title to a fellow sportswriter who noted that Mr. Jackson was \"the last legendary athlete to do these impossible-to-conceive feats without the benefit (or curse) of a thousand camera angles.\"</p><p>The Holiday Books Issue</p><p>Our annual gift-giving guide is here. Plus: generals who wouldn't back down, the life of a Broadway titan, the long history of corporations and much more.</p><p>His talent was God-given, luckily for him, since his gifts made possible his escape from a dire adolescence in Bessemer, Ala. He was born Vincent Edward Jackson in 1962, the eighth of 10 children. The poverty of his youth—he sometimes wore socks, but no shoes, to school—was compounded by an embarrassing stutter, which his peers mocked and which led teachers to deem him slow-witted. Little wonder, then, that Vincent misbehaved to the point of delinquency, hurling rocks at cars (and people), stealing bicycles, bullying classmates and intimidating adults. There was good reason to fear him: When Mr. Jackson was 13, he and a group of boys hopped the fence into a neighbor's yard and amused themselves by beating to death, with sticks, an untold number of male hogs—boars. As Mr. Pearlman explains: \"Boar hog, when enunciated, sounds just like it reads. But when uttered quickly, with a hardy Alabama twang, it's more like bo hog. Bo, for short.\" Hence the nickname, which Jackson embraced.</p><p>Talk of Mr. Jackson became Bunyanesque during his prep career at McAdory High, where he dominated in football (newspaper reporter after a game: \"Bo Jackson did everything you can do in Brookwood except mine a ton of coal\"); baseball (major league scout: \"I saw this player down here and I don't know if he's a boy or a man\"); and track and field (opposing decathlete: \"Bo Jackson was better than us. That's it, that's all, no debate\").</p><p>At Auburn University, Mr. Jackson excelled at all three sports, and as a running back won the Heisman Trophy in 1985. The following spring, Tampa Bay selected Mr. Jackson with the first overall pick in the NFL draft, but he opted instead for a spot in the outfield with the Kansas City Royals, who had also selected him. In 1987, the Los Angeles Raiders took a chance on Jackson in the seventh round, and soon enough, he was starring on both the diamond and the gridiron, inspiring a celebrated Nike ad campaign—\"Bo Knows\"—that testified to Mr. Jackson's all-around greatness. Alas, a devastating hip injury in a 1991 NFL playoff game ended his football career and led to his retirement from baseball three years later. But in his too-short career he homered in his very first plate appearance as an All Star (on the way to being named the game's MVP) and in three of his four NFL seasons broke off the longest run from scrimmage. He was also the only player to be named to both a baseball All-Star team and a football Pro Bowl team.</p><p>In less capable hands, Mr. Pearlman's childlike wonder in relating his subject's exploits might come off as cloying. Instead, the author's palpable enthusiasm supercharges descriptions of Mr. Jackson's at-bats or off-tackle runs, which are often described with hyperbole that is at once self-aware and delightfully cheesy. Consider Mr. Pearlman's account of a home run Mr. Jackson crushed during his Auburn days: \"The ball was still rising as it crossed the two-lane street [behind the stadium]. Still rising as it traveled above a line of eighty-foot-tall pine trees positioned behind the fence . . . Thanks to gravity, there is a 96.7 percent chance the ball landed somewhere on Earth, and in all likelihood, the state of Alabama. That, however, was never confirmed.\" Readers should also consult Mr. Pearlman's occasional and often hilarious footnotes. By his count, the author—renowned for his tenacity—interviewed more than 700 people in his reporting for the book: friends, coaches, teammates, opponents, fellow journalists and batboys.</p><p>One person whom Mr. Pearlman did not interview was Mr. Jackson himself, who, upon learning of the planned book, called to confer his blessing while declining to participate, warning Mr. Pearlman how difficult the task would be. And so it was—even if augmented by extensive use of the 1990 autobiography Mr. Jackson wrote with sports journalist Dick Schaap (as well as Schaap's research materials). \"The Last Folk Hero\" portrays a superstar as elusive off the field as he was on it.</p><p>Mr. Jackson's motivations never quite snap into focus; fame and fortune seemed to count for little, and his indifference to training shows an apathy for testing the outer limits of his potential. He could be cruel and petty, insulting reporters and once charging a former teammate a fee for his autograph. Yet he was also capable of kindness, as when he took a deep, sincere interest in a 10-year-old boy dying of leukemia. This much is certain: There is far more to the man than his studied posture as a country boy who, all things being equal, would rather be hunting or fishing.</p><p>Perhaps the larger question is why we need folk heroes in the first place. No doubt there is an unmistakable thrill in watching fellow mortals perform like gods—whether, as in Mr. Jackson's case, striding straight up an outfield wall after making a catch; uncorking a 320-foot throw to home for an out; or bulldozing celebrated defenders en route to the end zone. But as the text thread with my friends suggests, it might be just as much about the unique human-to-human connection that comes from swapping stories, and sports provides an endless number of moments through which so many of us can connect. Bo knows this, too, as when he told Mr. Pearlman, \"Everyone wants to do a Bo book.\" Maybe not everyone, Mr. Pearlman concedes, but there is surely a throng that will want to read this excellent one.</p><p>Mr. Graybill is a professor of history and director of the William P.
