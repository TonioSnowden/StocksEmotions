  "text": "<p>Nike chief executive John Donahoe gave an impassioned defence of his company's business in China, months after the world's largest sportswear brand became ensnared in a consumer backlash over its past statements on Xinjiang.</p> <p>“Nike is a brand that is of China and for China,” Donahoe said on Thursday in response to a question from an analyst regarding the competition Nike faced from other brands in the region. </p> <p>In March, Chinese state media <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d1943b0-07f0-4c46-979a-9d1294886ea3\">circulated</a> a months-old statement from Nike that expressed concern over reports of forced labour in Xinjiang. More than 1m Uyghurs are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4cc4782-7cc9-4402-bf6e-843d8366fc64\">known to have been detained</a> in the western region, which produces more than four-fifths of China's cotton.</p> <p>The re-emergence of Nike's statement sparked criticism from celebrities, including pop star and then-Nike brand ambassador Wang Yibo, who said he would cut ties with the sportswear maker. <a href=\"https://purpose.nike.com/statement-on-xinjiang\">A statement</a> on Nike's website says it does not source any products or supplies from the region.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Shares of Chinese athletic brands that compete with Nike in the region, including Li Ning and Anta Sports, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbab6232-0d7e-4964-9470-9dd2b306845f\">rose initially</a> in early April amid the backlash against western brands, which included <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b39e08d2-55be-42c6-b107-a67fdf25dce8\">Swedish fast-fashion chain H&amp;M</a>.</p> <p>In financial results released on Thursday, Nike reported sales in greater China of $1.9bn for the three months ended May 31, up 17 per cent from the same period in 2020.</p> <p>For the company as a whole, revenues doubled to $12.3bn for the quarter, helping it swing to a $1.5bn profit, up from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7806647b-7c57-4d29-b747-1eeaeb7c7928\">$709m loss</a> a year earlier at the nadir of the pandemic. Nike's shares rose 14 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.</p> <p>Donahoe attributed the company's success in China in part to its decades-long investment. “We have been in China for over 40 years,” he said, a connection established by Phil Knight, Nike co-founder and former chief executive.&#xa0;</p> <p>Donahoe, who took the helm in January 2020, spent the early days of his tenure visiting Nike's operations in China. He said the company's “biggest asset is consumer equity [in the brand] . . . it's real, I saw it in my first week on the job”.</p><p>Source: Sara Germano in New York 2021 'Nike chief executive says brand is ‘of China and for China'' FT.com 25 June.
