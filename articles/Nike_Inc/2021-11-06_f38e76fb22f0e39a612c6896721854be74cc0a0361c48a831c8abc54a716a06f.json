  "text": "<p>I'll be honest: it was a little difficult to get excited for this year's <strong>World Series</strong>. For baseball fans outside of Houston and Atlanta, there were reasons to be ambivalent on both sides. The <strong>Astros </strong>became the pariahs of the sport in early 2020 in a cheating scandal over <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/astros-sign-stealing-penalty\">sign-stealing</a>. The <strong>Braves</strong> club and fans remain steadfast in using indigenous symbols for their mascot and stadium chant, even as other teams have abandoned such hurtful traditions. </p> <p>That's not to sour on the World Series as a whole. Rather, it's a reflection of what it means to engage with sports today: balancing the pleasure of watching a game played at the highest level with the weight of moral and ethical questions surrounding it. This week's Scoreboard reflects on that theme. We preview yet another looming dispute in baseball — a potential labour stoppage. Then we explain how racism allegations within English cricket spiralled out of control. Do read on — <em>Sara Germano, US Sports business correspondent</em></p> <h1>Major League Baseball's looming shut down</h1> <p>On Tuesday evening at 10:33pm local time, Atlanta Braves first baseman <strong>Freddie Freeman</strong> caught the throw from short to clinch the World Series title.</p> <p>For Freeman and the Braves, it cemented the franchise's first championship since 1995. For the rest of <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>, it might have been the last moment of professional baseball played for many months to come.</p> <p>The looming question for this off season is whether the league and the <strong>MLB Players Association</strong> will commit to a new collective bargaining agreement before the deadline of 11:59 PM on December 1. If they do not, the US sport may see its first official work stoppage since the devastating player strike in 1994.</p> <p>Tensions between both sides have been simmering throughout the pandemic, as baseball was uniquely hammered by early coronavirus shutdowns. Teams derive a greater proportion of their revenues from ticket sales and concessions than other US professional sports, while its players are also not subject to a salary cap.</p> <p>So what's at stake?</p> <p>In the immediate term, if MLB and MLBPA don't agree on a new CBA, team owners could lock out the players. That will mean a freeze on free agency for some 160 athletes this year who, after serving six years in the league, are eligible to sign contracts with new teams. If no agreement is reached before February, spring training and the start of the 2022 regular season could be in jeopardy.</p> <p>More broadly, a CBA is necessary for tackling more existential problems in the sport, such as the shift of viewers away from traditional television to internet services. An agreement is necessary for finalising any new media contracts, in part because the two sides have to sign off on the number of games to be played each season and postseason, which determines how much content is available to broadcasters and advertisers. </p> <p>This comes as MLB is in talks to launch a nationwide video streaming service, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/17/mlb-in-talks-to-launch-nationwide-streaming-service-for-home-games/\">according to the New York Post</a>. Such a move would undercut the already ailing industry of regional sports networks and local cable channels which obtain broadcast rights to local sports teams.</p> <p><strong>Chris Ripley</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Sinclair Broadcast Group</strong>, which operates dozens of RSNs, tamped down concerns about the plan to analysts this week, saying “in order to be successful in direct-to-consumer long term, we think you need scale well beyond a team or just a league. And that's why a multisport offering makes a lot of sense”.</p> <p>To be sure, MLB and the MLBPA have historically been on a rocky footing. League commissioner <strong>Rob Manfred</strong> and players association director <strong>Tony Clark</strong> traded barbs during the summer of 2020 over terms to conclude the truncated pandemic season. </p> <p>At the start of this year's World Series, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-business-atlanta-braves-rob-manfred-3795f03f4cf73be61a040b0aedce4550\">Manfred said</a> “our clubs are 100 per cent committed to . . . an agreement by Dec 1” while Clark said the players are “looking to take advantage of as many days as the schedule permits [over] the next five-plus weeks to continue that dialogue”.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Yorkshire, racism and how not to deal with a crisis</h1> <p>For anyone seeking a case study on how not to deal with racism allegations, see this week's events involving <strong>Yorkshire County Cricket Club</strong>, one of England's leading cricket teams.</p> <p>As detailed by this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0af5fe21-5ee1-46fb-8c1b-a27dbf008cb3\">FT column</a>, the episode centres on <strong>Azeem Rafiq</strong>, a former Yorkshire player who last year revealed in a series of interviews that he had been the victim of racist abuse from teammates during his time at the club. Rafiq said he contemplated suicide as a result.</p> <p>Smart, modern organisations will know how to react to such damaging claims. Launch a speedy investigation. Be transparent about the findings. Issue sanctions for anyone involved in racism. Offer a sincere apology. Make efforts to reform. </p> <p>But Yorkshire is a club that has long considered itself exceptional. Over its 158-year history, it only began accepting players born outside the English county in 1992. </p> <p>Yes, the club initiated an independent probe, but it dragged on for months. While the investigation found Rafiq had faced repeated instances of racist behaviour, Yorkshire kept the full report confidential. The club apologised, but added there was no need to discipline those involved.</p> <p>The racism report, inevitably, leaked to the press. This week, the Cricinfo website <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/yorkshire-racism-report-ruled-azeem-rafiq-being-called-p-i-was-banter-1286449\">reported</a> a Yorkshire player — subsequently revealed to be former England batsman <strong>Gary Ballance</strong> — had repeatedly called Rafiq a “P***,” a well-known racial slur against British Asians. The club determined it was just good-natured “banter” between players. </p> <p>Cue opprobrium. </p> <p>UK health secretary <strong>Sajid Javid</strong>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1455535587897774083\">wrote on Twitter</a>: “‘P***' is not banter. Heads should roll at Yorkshire CCC.”&#xa0;</p> <p>One by one, Yorkshire's sponsors cut ties, including <strong>Emerald Group Publishing</strong>, which had naming rights to the club's <strong>Headingley Stadium</strong>, kit manufacturer <strong>Nike</strong>, shirt sponsor <strong>Anchor Butter</strong>, and local partners <strong>Harrogate Water</strong> and <strong>Yorkshire Tea</strong>.</p> <p>The scandal kept spiralling. The <strong>England and Wales Cricket Board</strong>, the national governing body, banned Yorkshire from hosting international matches until it had reformed.</p> <p>Ballance <a href=\"https://yorkshireccc.com/news/view/9620/statement-by-gary-ballance\">apologised</a> but added that Rafiq “said things to me that were not acceptable and I did the same with [him]”. He was then barred from selection to the England team. Former England captain <strong>Michael Vaughn</strong> <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/11/04/michael-vaughan-named-azeem-rafiq-report-totally-deny-accusation/\">revealed</a> he had been named in Yorkshire's report but denied saying anything racist. By Friday, <strong>Roger Hutton</strong>, Yorkshire's chair, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7923b86f-a7c1-479e-83b4-eec4549858e7\">had resigned</a>.</p> <p>In the course of a week, Yorkshire was left with an enormous financial hit, its leadership in tatters and reputation in shreds. All because the club stood behind a position that racial slurs can be dismissed as “banter”. That's the cost of defending the indefensible. The lessons for sports administrators everywhere are clear.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The former heads of world and European football have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd1d016f-5263-4161-bb4b-af7968abd787\">charged with fraud</a> in Switzerland as part of a long-running corruption investigation. In focus is a SFr2m ($2m) payment authorised by former <strong>Fifa</strong> president <strong>Sepp Blatter</strong> to<strong> Michel Platini</strong>, previously his counterpart at <strong>Uefa</strong>.
