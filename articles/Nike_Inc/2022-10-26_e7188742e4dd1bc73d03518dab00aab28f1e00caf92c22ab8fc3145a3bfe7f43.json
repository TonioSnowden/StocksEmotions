  "title": "Ye's Adidas Breakup Scrambles the Sneaker Resale Market; A frenzy for the rapper's designs after Adidas pledged to end Yeezy production has some models selling for $50 to $100 more",
  "text": "<p>\"Over the past 24 hours since Adidas and Kanye ended their partnership, the market has been going insane,\" said Geovanny Monroy, 18, a student and sneaker reseller in East Orange, N.J., who said he saw resale prices of the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 and Adidas Yeezy Boost 700 sneakers shoot up by $50 to $100 overnight.</p><p>According to publicly available data on StockX, a streetwear reselling site, prices of certain Adidas Yeezy sneakers have risen by more than 20 percent.</p><p>Adidas said it would immediately \"end production of Yeezy branded products\" on Tuesday. The statement went on to say that Adidas remains the sole owner of all design rights to existing products—as well as \"previous and new colorways under the partnership.\"</p><p>In a research note Tuesday, UBS analyst Zuzanna Pusz suggested the messaging from Adidas meant the company will continue to sell Yeezy products under the Adidas brand from 2023 onward. An Adidas representative declined to comment beyond the company's statement.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, the StockX sales price of the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 model in salt (a grayish hue) climbed to $307, up from $215 one week ago and the sales price of thesand colored Yeezy Foam Rnnr hit $184 compared with $157 last week. Other items, like the popular Adidas Yeezy Slide were holding steady at around $100, still a substantial increase from their $70 retail price.</p><p>\"A lot of people are wanting to buy Yeezy products right now, because they're scared that the price is going to go up,\" said Mr. Monroy, who is himself sitting on a couple Yeezys he hopes to flip for more down the line.</p><p>Before Adidas severed ties, Ye espoused anti-Semitic views on social media and in interviews. Earlier this month, he wore a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt while presenting his fashion show in Paris, far overshadowing the clothes on the runway. The phrase is often used by white supremacist groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.</p><p>In its statement, Adidas said \"Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.\"</p><p>As of Wednesday morning, searches for \"Yeezy\" on the German sportswear company's website turned up no results. On Tuesday, Foot Locker instructed its retail staff to pull any existing Yeezy product from its shelves and digital sites.</p><p>Until now, Adidas produced Yeezy sneakers at a steady clip. (Even after Ye's string of anti-Semitic comments, the company continued to send out emails marketing the shoes.) Yeezys, from this point forward, will be far more scarce, and possibly more valuable on the resale market.</p><p>Daejin Park, 19, a student and sneaker reseller in New York, likened the resale climate to the immediate aftermath of Kobe Bryant's death, which led to a rush of fans buying his signature Nike basketball shoes at inflated prices. (Production of Bryant's sneakers stopped for a period.) Though Mr. Park stressed that the circumstances are quite different, he said that Yeezys are similarly now going to be harder to find, which has collectors circling.</p><p>He is betting that Yeezy Slides in particular will go up in price in the warmer months to come, as those shoes were already a top seller last summer. \"Without the constant supply to meet the demand, prices are just going to go crazy,\" he said.</p><p>It is not hyperbole to say that Ye's collaboration with Adidas (which made its debut in 2015) shifted the sneaker market. The Yeezy Boost 350, a sock-esque, low-profile shoe which arrived in 2016, inspired a multitude of look-alike hosiery-type lace-ups from other sneaker companies. The Yeezy Boost 700 \"Wave Runner,\" with its honking soles and retro gray upper, helped chime in a \"dad sneaker\" trend of the late 2010s.</p><p>During the pandemic period, keeping with a push toward squishy slip-ons in the broader shoe market, Yeezy introduced its bulbous, tooth-soled slides and straight-from-Mars Foam Rnnr clog.</p><p>These sneakers and shoes, which were often sold in maddeningly small quantities, stoked a fervent resale market where certain models fetched multiples of their sticker price. To this day, a Yeezy Boost 750 in new condition is listed at $5,000 on Flight Club, a sneaker resale site.</p><p>Some resellers have wondered if the uptick in prices over the past few days could swing the other way: There are clearly people that want to get rid of their Yeezys. Every transaction, after all, requires a seller shedding their pairs. Ye's anti-Semitic comments may well have made the designer so controversial that many people don't want to be associated with him, or his sneakers. One resale platform, the RealReal, said on Tuesday it was no longer accepting items associated with Ye or the Yeezy brand.</p><p>\"There are absolutely people who, in light of the recent controversy, don't want to support the brand anymore and that's understandable,\" said Mark Black, 16, a student and sneaker reseller in San Jose, Calif. He said he recently received a message from a young man whose dad was forcing him to sell off his pre-worn Yeezys.</p><p>Yet, Mr. Black felt that scarcity, and not any of Ye's comments, that will decide where the market goes. \"Demand will likely increase over a long period of time and we will most likely see a huge increase in Yeezy prices, but it's going to take awhile,\" he said. \"Long term, people want what other people don't have.\"</p><p>—Inti Pacheco contributed reporting to this article.</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Ye's Adidas Breakup Scrambles the Sneaker Resale Market</p>",
