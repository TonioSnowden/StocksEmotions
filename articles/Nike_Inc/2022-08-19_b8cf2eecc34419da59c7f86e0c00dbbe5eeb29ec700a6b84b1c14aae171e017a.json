  "title": "Myths Carved Into Motion; Around the corner from the Parthenon Sculptures at the British Museum, the lesser-known frieze from the temple of Apollo at Bassae depicts Greek battles of legend in panels of breathless action",
  "text": "<p>The frieze originally ran around the top of the walls of the temple's cella, the inner room or \"cell\" containing the cult statue of Apollo. Each panel of the frieze is around 2 feet tall, and the 23 panels combine to just over 100 feet in length. Their original sequences remain disputed, and their makers are unknown. Modern scholars dismiss an attribution to Paionios, who made the statue of Nike at nearby Olympia, and detect the hands of at least three sculptors.</p><p>The Parthenon overlooks the city of Pericles and democracy. Its marbles are a smooth civic ritual in form and content, a stately progress of horses, men and drapery. Bassae sits alone on a ridge below Mount Kotylios in the wilds of Arcadia. The flux of conflict on its frieze has the graininess and brutality of myth, and a roiling, crude intimacy with violence and the gods.</p><p>The Centauromachy derives from Homer. As the Lapith tribe carried the gift of a girdle to the shrine of Artemis, centaurs tried to abduct the Lapith women. The Lapiths fought savagely with swords, clubs, kicking, punching, even hair-pulling. Only two of the panels overlap, but all are furrowed with rough diagonal downstrokes, like the lightning that connects sky and earth.</p><p>The bodies are contorted in struggle, as though striving toward heroism. At the left of the portion pictured here, a centaur hauls at a Lapith woman's extended right arm as she strains back in counterpoise, protecting her infant. Elsewhere, similar scenes abound. As a centaur grabs a woman by the neck, a Lapith man dives at its feet. The woman escapes, the centaur grips the man's helmet and kicks him in the face with a hoof. A centaur kicks one Lapith away with its rear legs, but a second Lapith buries his sword in the centaur's ribcage; the centaur twists his head and bites the man's jugular. A centaur and Lapith fight with elemental, intimate weapons, a tree branch and a rock.</p><p>The Lapiths prevail with divine intervention, and the action flows straight into the Amazonamachy. Herakles' ninth labor is to steal the leather belt worn by an earlier Amazon queen, Hippolyte. An Amazon saves a wounded comrade and anticipates the raised spear of Herakles' comrade Telamon. A horse rears as a Greek drags an Amazon from the saddle, her body twisting as she falls. Herakles, wearing the pelt of the Nemean lion, struggles with Hippolyte, wearing her belt around her waist.</p><p>The action shifts forward in time, to Homer's account of how the Amazon queen Penthesilea attacked the Greeks at Troy. Achilles draws back his sword to kill Penthesilea as an Amazon rushes forward to strike him. The eye is carried irresistibly along the frieze by the rhythm and organization of the figures, and as the human becomes the heroic, we see war's ugliness and its idealization.</p><p>When Pausanias, the Baedeker of the Greeks, visited Bassae in the second century A.D., he recorded that the nearby city of Phigalia had dedicated the temple to Apollo Epikourios, \"the Helper,\" for averting the Great Plague of 429-427 B.C. and preserving the Phigalians during the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.). Bassae's design combined the old Archaic style with the new Classical style. It is a unique hybrid, the only surviving Greek temple to contain all three orders: a Doric exterior, an Ionic interior, and, at the rear of the cella, the earliest-known Corinthian column.</p><p>The Parthenon's Centauromachy was placed high on the temple's exterior. It subordinates the chaos of battle to the rhythm of architecture by interposing decorative panels between each pane of the action. Its life-or-death struggles are static, dance-like poses; the bodies of the combatants rarely touch. At Bassae, the secrets of the struggle between men and gods, and how life turns into religion and art, were hidden inside the cella, but they were crueler and closer to the eye. The British Museum exhibits the frieze in a cubicle shaped like the cella, and viewers climb stairs to examine it in merciless proximity.</p><p>Most visitors rush to the Parthenon Sculptures, so the frieze can be seen in solitude. You can also view its original location alone. The mountains around Bassae are inaccessible to tourist buses. Driving there in a rental car, I crossed a flooded road at the foot of a ravine, scraping over rocks and tree debris. The other human presences at the temple were a sleepy gatekeeper and some French archaeology students. The view of Mount Kotylios has changed little since Pausanias slogged up there, and the rocks and woods of Arcadia retain their rough magic.</p><p>Mr. Green is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a Journal contributor.</p><p>Myths Carved Into Motion</p>",
