  "text": "<p>* Vonage shares soared 26% ahead of the opening bell. Ericsson agreed to buy the cloud-communications provider for $6.2 billion, in deal that the Swedish telecom-equipment maker said will expand its wireless enterprise business and broaden its global offerings.</p><p>* Activision Blizzard slipped 1.4% premarket. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick has told senior managers he would consider leaving the company if he can't quickly fix the culture problems at the videogame giant, according to people familiar with his comments.</p><p>* Rivian dropped 4% premarket while Ford was little changed.

Tesla shares added 2.3%, and Lucid slipped 3.4%</p><p>* Vaccine makers Moderna and Novavax were both on the rise, adding 2.4% and 4.1% respectively. Pfizer was up a more muted 0.8%.</p><p>* Airbnb slipped 1.6% premarket. Perhaps investors are worrying that a recent rise in Covid-19 cases in many countries could cut into travel this winter.</p><p>* Roblox was extending its recent tear premarket, adding 3.8%. Last week the online-gaming company said it plans to bring educational games to schools world-wide, and Nike launched a virtual play place on Roblox's platform.</p><p>* Zoom Video Communications, Urban Outfitters and Agilent Technologies are due to report results after the close.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* The roster of public companies is on the rise again after decades of declineâ€”thanks to frothy valuations, dizzying price climbs and splashy initial public offerings.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Astra Space, Vonage, Rivian, Zoom Video: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
