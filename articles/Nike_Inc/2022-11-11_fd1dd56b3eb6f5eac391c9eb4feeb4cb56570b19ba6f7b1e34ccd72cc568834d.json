  "title": "Gap's Amazon Partnership Is a Desperate Look; Gap's decision to sell on Amazon is a step back, not forward",
  "text": "<p>Gap is going against the trend.</p><p>The company, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said on Thursday that it would start selling a selection of basic apparel from its namesake brand on Amazon through a dedicated online store. Its stock, which has taken a beating so far this year, has jumped nearly 11% since the announcement.</p><p>The decision is quite the pivot for Gap, which doesn't sell through department stores or other wholesale channels. It isn't even clear how much listing on Amazon will help the top line: Gap itself has a sizable online business, which as of last quarter made up more than a third of total sales.</p><p>There is a reason other clothing brands are hesitant to sell on Amazon: Doing so means giving up a cut of the sale proceeds andcustomer data. Notably, Gap's selection of basics would overlap with Amazon's own private label sold through \"Amazon Essentials.\"</p><p>Moving to Amazon can also harm brand perception because Amazon is a marketplace for everything, not exactly a curated platform, and one associated with value rather than exclusivity. In short, it is not a decision that a clothing brand—especially such a household name—would make unless its business outlook is looking very bleak.</p><p>Apparel brands have in recent years tended to do exactly the opposite: Those that sold through third-party channels have been pulling back in favor of selling directly to customers, a shift that has helped improve margins and customer loyalty. This includes the likes of Under Armour, Ralph Lauren, Levi's and Nike. In fact, Nike started a pilot program to sell on Amazon starting in 2017 but broke that partnership two years later.</p><p>The best-case scenario for Gap would be that it successfully uses Amazon as a temporary platform to sell through excess inventory. Last quarter, the company said it had 37% more inventory compared with a year earlier. Out of that excess, the company said a good chunk of it was \"elevated levels of slow-turning basics.\"</p><p>If this turns out to be a long-term move, though, it is almost certainly going to come with declines in brand perception and margins. As it is, Gap's margins are thinner than they were prepandemic.</p><p>Either way, listing on Amazon is an unflattering look on Gap.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Gap's Amazon Partnership Is a Desperate Look</p>",
