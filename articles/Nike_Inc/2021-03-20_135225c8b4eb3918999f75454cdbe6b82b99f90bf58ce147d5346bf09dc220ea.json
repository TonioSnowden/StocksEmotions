  "text": "<p>   Spring has technically sprung. Many Americans are vaccinated or have vax appointments in view. With luck, you'll soon step into a bright, bustling life beyond your cluttered living room. And the sloppy sweats you've been wallowing in for months? Leave them behind, even if abandoning their plush, reassuring embrace will challenge you. Suiting -- yes, suiting -- is here to help you segue from athleisure addict to presentable person. </p><p>   Designers realize that, after a year in loungewear, women are loath to abandon comfort. So this spring, brands from Stella McCartney and the Row to Brunello Cucinelli and Max Mara strategically proposed louche suits so relaxed, they might as well be PJs. \"An oversize suit is . . . the perfect transition from what we've been forced to wear in the last year,\" said New York stylist Emma Jade Morrison. \"They're just as easy to wear as a sweatsuit.\" Treat them unpreciously, she urges: Try one with a T-shirt and sneakers for errands or a brisk walk (as her client model Emily Ratajkowski does). </p><p>   Lily Snyder, 37, a New York art adviser, succumbed to sweats during the pandemic, but is excited to reacquaint herself with her wardrobe of generous suits by labels like Paul Smith and Bottega Veneta. Ms. Snyder appreciates that some women don't want to be constricted by dresses or blistered by high-heels again. \"But my [suits] aren't binding. They make me feel great . . . like my true and best self.\" She often wears her ample ensembles with a collared shirt, platform shoes and cuff links. </p><p>   \"Style and comfort don't need to be mutually exclusive anymore,\" said Lisa Aiken, the New York-based buying and fashion director of e-commerce site Moda Operandi. Interest in breezy tailoring by brands like Jacquemus and Altuzarra has ticked up, she's noticed lately. </p><p>   Once upon a time, this comfort-style combo didn't seem so surprising. In the mid-19th century, lightweight wool suiting became the male leisurewear of choice, said Dr. Chris Breward, director of National Museums Scotland. Only in the early 20th century did suits get stigmatized by stiff, office associations. From the 1860s on, wool \"lounge suits\" were considered ideal for, as Dr. Breward put it, \"country pursuits\" like Saturday woodland walks, hunting, fishing and even sprawling on the beach. \"They were much more informal garments.\" Eventually the style was controversially appropriated by such trailblazing women as Marlene Dietrich, pictured here posing in a subversively untrim suit in the 1930s (See accompanying photo -- WSJ Mar. 20, 2021). </p><p>   Some modern adherents are bringing slouchy suits back to their casual roots. JiaJia Fei, a 34-year-old digital strategist in Brooklyn, bikes to work in her bright, monochromatic versions. To walk her \"giant\" dog in Los Angeles, Cassandra Grey, the founder and CEO of beauty retailer Violet Grey, wears one of her eight loose suits from brands like the Row with cream Air Jordans and a sweatshirt. \"If you just buy a few suits, you can make a whole uniform and never have to worry about clothes again,\" said Ms. Grey, 43, who sometimes wears hers with a men's button-down or even just a bra. </p><p>   Wardrobes anchored in tailoring are New York designer Marina Moscone's specialty. \"People want to collect a great suit -- they don't want to buy six average things,\" she said. \"And you can take the suit and make six outfits out of it.\" One day earlier this month, Ms. Moscone paired her tuxedo trousers with a sweater and Nike Air Force 1s; the next, she wore the full suit around town. </p><p>   To avoid comparisons to Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, who wriggled in an absurdly roomy suit in the 1984 concert film, \"Stop Making Sense,\" Ms. Moscone insists your jacket's shoulders must fit \"amazingly.\" Ms. Fei precisely calibrates her sleeve and pant lengths, but doesn't mind a billowing blazer. \"I've definitely worn suits that are too big,\" she said. \"But as long as they're comfortable, it still feels like the right fit.\" Ms. Morrison, the stylist, said showing a scintilla of skin can soften the look. \"Maybe you don't wear anything underneath and your clavicle shows.\" She suggested more modest women roll up the sleeves or tuck the trousers into a boot for \"a little more shape at the bottom.\" </p><p>   Carolina Cucinelli, the co-president of Italian luxury label Brunello Cucinelli, conceded that an oversize suit could intimidate the uninitiated. But she encourages them to think outside of the box. Avoid stodgy formality by choosing a cheerful color like peach, an unexpected cargo trouser or by using a bright sneaker and hoodie to \"break up\" the suit's perceived stuffiness. Accessorize irreverently, counsels Ms. Morrison, especially when it comes to footwear. \"Anything that has a bit of humor behind it works really well,\" she said. Converse sneakers, beat-up loafers, chunky sandals and clogs all supply adequate flippancy. But don't overthink it, Ms. Morrison cautioned. \"Just throw it on. The less you style it, the more natural and inherently comfortable it's going to look.\" And feel, for that matter. You won't even miss those sweats. </p><p></p>",
