  "text": "<p>When architecture or decoration goes wrong, it's often because it has been executed with insufficient regard for human scale. \"I've never been afraid of too much room. But the idea of processing grandeur is very important. Do you want to put your bed in the middle of Grand Central Station and sleep there?\" asks Smith. \"There are certain fundamentals that everyone shares. We're more comfortable sitting against a wall. We're more comfortable in a small space than in a giant one.\"</p><p>In a career spanning more than three decades, Smith, 58, has had far more practice humanizing the heroic than most decorators of his generation. In addition to designing houses for a long list of heavyweights—Steven Spielberg, Elaine Wynn, Shonda Rhimes and Harrison Ford, to name a few—Smith refreshed the living quarters and some of the major public rooms in the Obama White House. (A 2010 New York Times article about those renovations was titled \"The Audacity of Taupe.\") He then took the show on the road, refurbishing the American embassy in Madrid when his partner, James Costos, was appointed ambassador to Spain and Andorra in 2013.</p><p>By the time Smith was ready to redo the house that he and Costos purchased in 2009 in Los Angeles's Holmby Hills neighborhood, swapping out a pretty Georgian cottage in Bel Air, he had become a virtuoso of the make-under. His quirky and fortresslike home seemed to demand it. Located across the street from the Manor, a 123-room faux-French extravaganza formerly owned by Aaron and Candy Spelling, Smith's house appears almost to have been built in sniffish reaction to its neighbor. Los Angeles houses are often greedy with the land they sit upon, but this one boasted a suspenseful set-back, pavilion-like, as if it were a museum.</p><p>In a sense it was. The philanthropists and art collectors Audrey and Sydney Irmas commissioned the house in the early 1990s from the Santa Barbara architect Timothy Morgan Steele. Essentially an 11,000-square-foot one-bedroom, it showcased a few brilliant gems in the Irmases' collection. Above the living room fireplace hung Cy Twombly's Untitled, 1968, one of his iconic Blackboard paintings. In 2015, it fetched $70.5 million at Sotheby's, a record for the artist.</p><p>As befits a structure holding pieces from a priceless art collection, the house, when Smith discovered it, had an almost paranoid orientation to its surroundings. The glass was bulletproof; there were few street-facing windows or doors. But Smith loved its accretion of discrete volumes, like chunks of some hitherto undiscovered crystal. It brought to mind Mexican modernist architecture, a Luis Barragán dressed all in beige.</p><p>\"It was built for a private couple but also very much for public events…which made it, for us, the perfect house at the perfect time,\" recalls Smith, who grew up in Southern California in the 1970s and, like many young aesthetes of his era, dreamed of the glamorous lives of Halston and Elsa Peretti, the fashion designer and Italian model–turned–jewelry designer who were fixtures at Studio 54. By the time he bought the house, Smith had also become active in Democratic political causes. \"We were giving a ton of fundraisers, and the house lent itself to that because it has this presence,\" he says. \"The idea of a heroic, even a propagandistic space is super intriguing. But what's the balance?\"</p><p>When a decorator does a house for himself, Smith says, he faces the temptation of turning it into a watershed of a lifetime of ideas, a sort of disjointed show house—the most perfectly realized Indian bathroom here, the apogee of a French provincial sitting room there. Smith did have a lot of ideas for the house, but he took advice he routinely gives his clients and lived in it for six years before undertaking any major renovations.</p><p>There were elements he loved and vowed to preserve: a baronial limestone fireplace; a whimsical, round, skylit powder room with a 17-foot ceiling. Over time, he found himself bothered by the house's diagonal lines. He wanted a swimming pool instead of the decorative reflecting pond that clung to the rear of the house. \"It's like buying somebody else's suit and having it recut,\" he says. \"It was a very elegant suit, but I had to recut it to fit me.\"</p><p>Above all, he wanted to upgrade the space for the guests he'd been putting up in what had been the Irmases' maid's room and gym, in a nook over the kitchen. \"For our very high-profile guests, it felt a little weird that they had to enter through the laundry room. Not cool.\"</p><p>The living room had until then been a sort of covered courtyard, an uncomfortable, cavernous space that Smith and Costos passed through on their way to breakfast. It felt good when it was filled by a party; they'd hosted a reception for the soon-to-be king and queen of Spain, a fundraiser for the Obama Foundation and an 80th birthday party for Jane Fonda there. But for two people, it felt challenging.</p><p>So Smith created an intimate sitting area in front of the fireplace with a pair of custom curvilinear sofas that bring to mind the designer Vladimir Kagan. He commissioned curtains in a mix of linens and wool from Hiroko Takeda, a New York–based artist who makes textile work evocative of Anni Albers. Smith had never collected much art, but now he had a home whose broad white walls cried out for it. In recent years, he's started building a collection, which includes a kaleidoscopic painting by Philip Taaffe that is reflected, catty-corner, in a Claude Lalanne mirror. On the far end of the room hangs an anonymous old master—school of Rubens, maybe—that he has owned since his 20s.</p><p>The room includes a number of pieces by artist-fabricators whom Smith has long admired: monumental lanterns by Philippe Anthonioz, a Paris-based bronze sculptor who spent three years in the workshop of Diego Giacometti; a pair of ceramic urns and columns by Peter Schlesinger, the former partner and frequent subject of David Hockney, which Smith had ordered for the Obama White House before they found their way back to him; and from Mattia Bonetti, the Swiss-born furniture designer, a coffee table with squiggling bronze legs that feel as if they might be a contemporary response to the Twombly blackboard scribbles that once hung a few feet away.</p><p>Smith notes that doing a traditional house is different. \"My apartment in New York is very French, almost an intellectual exercise in: Could I build a French apartment? We had all this paneling and boiserie made in France and installed there,\" he says. \"But to commission specific artists whom I've worked with to do furniture or make rooms is not something I've done for myself. It's more of a 20th-century idea.\"</p><p>Renovating during a pandemic was arduous; the project, which involved creating a second-floor guest wing, stretched to a full four years. \"Regular stress was stressful already,\" he says, noting that the demand for his services exploded during lockdown, even as his ability to deliver contracted. \"It was accelerated by a layer of catastrophic stress: global plague, fear of death, the feeling that everything you do professionally is on slippery rocks. You had huge amounts of want and an inability to meet it, so it was somehow both incredibly exciting and horrifyingly frightening. It was almost like a black-and-white movie bad dream: Be careful what you wish for.\"</p><p>Long before he became a decorator, Smith was an amateur obsessive. As a child, he read James Clavell's Shōgun, then ate nothing but Japanese food and put his mattress on the floor. In his work, he pushes clients toward building spaces that hold a mirror up to their own natures. \"Rooms that captivate people are rooms that are personal,\" he says. \"That's the craft I find most interesting: successfully creating a space whose effect is immersion in somebody's personal culture.\"</p><p>His new house, likewise, comprises a series of immersive boxes: a circular, double-height screening room, a bar paneled in Oregon Douglas fir, a bathroom wrapped in faux alabaster. Nancy Lorenz, a New York–based artist who is Smith's friend and frequent collaborator, deserves much credit for one such space. In her studio in Astoria, Queens, she created a luminous cloudscape for the dining room walls. Smith's collection of scholar's rocks found a new home on an Italian gilt console at one end of the room. He had envisioned a louche, lacquered '30s Shanghai effect; at night, under candlelight, the room shimmers like water under the moon.</p><p>Shonda Rhimes, both a friend and a client, recalls the small dinners Smith and Costos hosted during the darkest days of the pandemic, a refuge from inertia and isolation. \"The fact that I spent a great deal of time at his house during the pandemic says so much about Michael,\" she explains. \"At a time when I didn't go anywhere. And when I say I didn't go anywhere, I mean it was literally the only place I went. It was like getting to step into this perfect, meticulously decorated bubble of safety. He found so many ways for us to be in community in a way that felt safe: dinners outside with heated blankets so we'd feel comfortable. Often you'd end up drifting into his wonderful, cozy sitting room with the bar. We've had dinner in that room and sat on the floor, and I've had conversations there with all kinds of extraordinary guests, petting his dog. It became a place to kick off your shoes and just be.\"</p><p>Behind the bar, Smith and Costos's bedroom is anchored by an early-20th-century Japanese screen whose silver panels are painted with arcing eucalyptus branches. (Smith has always had one Japanese screen or another in his homes.) The bedroom, as conceived by the Irmases, had a pair of bathrooms and dressing rooms at opposite ends, and Smith found himself charmed by this old-fashioned arrangement. While his own closet reveals a rainbow of cashmere sweaters, Costos's is striking for its sneaker collection. During the pandemic, he developed something of an addiction to Nike's online customizable shoe service, with a special affinity for red and yellow, the colors of the Spanish flag.</p><p>Mrs. Irmas's bathroom, now Smith's, also turned into an homage to Spain, the couple's adoptive second home. (This spring, after renting for a few years, they bought an apartment in Madrid.) The bathroom is a fusion of three of Smith's preoccupations: the alabaster walls of a bank in Granada designed by the architect Alberto Campo Baeza; the room in the final scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey, with its illuminated grid floor; and a photograph of the socialite Gloria Guinness in her Paris bathroom from the 1950s.</p><p>\"It was great to take these snapshots that I carry around in my head—my own internal Pinterest board—and bring them all together,\" Smith says. On account of the previous owners' privacy concerns, the bathroom had only one small window. To create more light, Smith commissioned a simulated, programmable LED skylight that changes hues and intensities to mimic the sun's progression across the sky, as if James Turrell were the electrician. \"Your brain knows that it's LED, but it feels like natural light,\" Smith explains, \"so it becomes slightly magical.\"</p><p>Smith describes his home as, among other things, a mid-career retrospective, a testament to his understanding that a house designed by Michael Smith for Michael Smith can never be isolating or inward-looking.</p><p>\"Houses are so personal,\" he says, \"but they are also connected to how one wants to be perceived. I want a house that makes me look thinner, smarter and better than I am—which I think everybody does in every house.\"</p><p>In fact, Smith's residence captures the restless polymath that he is. There is no Halston room, merely a series of Smith rooms. \"This was about keeping the house still enough that all the things I love could be in it,\" he says. \"The house is a moment in time, but not so much a moment in time that I couldn't also grow into it. Not every wall needs to be full, not every space needs to be defined.\"</p><p>An L.A. Interior Designer's Exquisite Fortress</p>",
