  "text": "<p>What's funny about these rumors is that both turned out to be true.</p><p>My family lived in Livingston, N.J., in a greenish-beige split-level house that was built on farmland in the early 1960s. Every house on the street looked alike.</p><p>Growing up, I'd wander for hours in the woods nearby. It sparked my imagination.</p><p>My father, Carl, was in-house counsel for Servisco, a laundry company for restaurants. He was a great dad. Work was a place he went to each day to get home to his three kids. My brother Larry is older than me and Craig is younger.</p><p>My mom, Corky, was eccentric. She was a feminist. In the early 1970s, her car had a bumper sticker that read, \"Women who seek to be equal to men lack ambition.\"</p><p>She was super intelligent. In 1970, she started the College Advisory Service with a friend that helped kids figure out which schools were an ideal fit. She was ahead of her time. She also worked at her father's travel company, Club ABC Tours. She really ran the place and was the brains behind it.</p><p>My parents were well read. Since there was no filter at home, especially with my mother, I heard plenty of stories about the neighbors and everybody else in town. That was an influence.</p><p>Both of my brothers were geniuses. My older brother skipped a grade, went to Phillips Academy Andover and then to Yale and Harvard Law. My younger brother followed the same path, though he went to Phillips Exeter.</p><p>I was the only one who stayed in public school. I did well and was popular, I guess, but I never really liked high school.</p><p>After graduation, I went to Amherst College, where I learned critical thinking. By my final year, I was bound for law school at the University of Chicago. I was all set to go until my grandfather and mother convinced me they needed help at Club ABC Tours. They urged me to defer a year. Then it was two years. Finally, I didn't see much point in going.</p><p>I expected to stay for two years at the company but wound up staying eight. During this time, my father died in 1988 when he was 59. I was 26.</p><p>Dad had lost his job at age 57 and took a new one that he was overqualified for. One day he had to fly to Tampa, Fla., for a meeting. I drove him to the airport, and we were running late.</p><p>A few hours later from Tampa, he called to say he wasn't feeling well. I called the hotel, and an ambulance took him to the hospital. We flew down right away.</p><p>His death was a devastating blow, but the loss made me more driven to live life to the fullest. In every book, I explore this kind of grief in some way.</p><p>At the time of his death, I was writing my first novel. My dream was just to have one novel published. I didn't care if it sold. I didn't care if I ever had another one. After \"Play Dead\" was published, I thought it would be great if I had a second book published, just to show it wasn't a fluke. After that happened with \"Miracle Cure\" in 1991, I was on my way.</p><p>Today, my wife, Anne, a pediatrician, and I live in Ridgewood, N.J., in a three-story Victorian house dating to 1865. We moved here in 1999 and still love it. But with our four children grown, we're not sure how much longer we'll remain.</p><p>As for those town rumors of my youth, a member of the Genovese crime family, lived in the house with the stone lions.</p><p>I also found out the Army had a Nike missile control base behind a school to protect New York City. Today the base is an art park.</p><p>There's always more to suburbia than meets the eye.</p><p>-- As told to Marc Myers</p><p>---</p><p>Harlan Coben, 60, is the author of more than 35 suspense novels, including his latest, \"The Match\" (Grand Central). Seven of his novels have been adapted for Netflix series, including \"The Stranger\" and \"Stay Close.\"</p><p>---</p><p>HARLAN'S HIDEOUT</p><p>Coolest thing? Our sunroom. There's just one problem.</p><p>What's that? It's where my wife, who is also head of admissions at Columbia Medical School, often Zooms. But that's fine. I can work anywhere.</p><p>Anywhere? I move around a lot. I need activity around me to create a white-noise bubble.</p><p>Such as? I've written in a coffee shop, a bookstore and even called an Uber and traveled distances just to write in the back seat.</p><p>And now? I'm in an old leather chair in my garage. I'll try writing here today because I'm not writing well in the house.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
