  "text": "<p>A growing number of Federal Reserve officials expect an interest rate increase next year as the US central bank charges ahead with a reduction of its massive stimulus programme that will probably be announced in November.</p> <p>Nine officials on the Federal Open Market Committee now expect a US interest rate increase next year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/719c11ec-fb24-40b3-a661-518aa3bc6028\">according to projections released yesterday</a>, with the remaining nine pencilling in a later “lift off”. In June, just seven officials were&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ce9fae-6c5d-4a27-83c8-7a40271a9ecc\">forecasting</a>&#xa0;a rise in 2022.</p> <p>The new projections suggest at least one more interest rate increase in 2023 compared with the predictions in June, bringing the total to at least three. At least three more rate increases are expected in 2024, according to the projections.</p> <p>At the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Fed pledged to buy $120bn of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities each month until it had seen “substantial further progress” towards average inflation of 2 per cent and maximum employment.</p> <p>At a press conference after the decision was made public Jay Powell said: “My own view is that the ‘substantial further progress' test is all but met.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The Fed chair added that the US central bank could “easily move ahead” with an announcement of the taper of its asset purchase programme at its next meeting in November if the economy progresses as the central bank expects.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I think that for most of this year the Fed has struck the&#xa0;right balance&#xa0;between acknowledging inflation pressures and keeping policy supportive,” writes my colleague Robert Armstrong in today's edition of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8757d9b-774b-481b-acfd-926ef89a99aa\">Unhedged email</a>.

Today the FT launches a quiz about the proposals making their way through Congress. First question: How has the top marginal federal income tax rate (%) changed over time, and what is it today? To answer click <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/biden-tax-plan-explainer/\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>The economic impact of limiting abortion access </strong>The US debate over abortion typically focuses on politics, ethics and religion — but rarely economics. This week, more than 150 economists and researchers weighed in on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61251b31-0041-461c-bd33-aacf2f13fe10\">how women will be affected</a> if states such as Mississippi and Texas are allowed to put stringent new restrictions on the procedure.</p> <p><strong>Xi Jinping weighs future of Evergrande as he targets third term</strong> Just a year away from an unprecedented third term in power, Xi Jinping is taking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4404ded1-82b0-475f-93cd-c54bba17d085\">one of the biggest economic gambles</a> of his presidency by letting Evergrande teeter on the edge of bankruptcy. A collapse would impact millions of people across the country but a bailout would set an expensive precedent.</p> <p><strong>What we can learn from Afghanistan's nascent crypto economy</strong> Reports suggest wealthy Afghans are using crypto to store wealth and move money overseas. The&#xa0;development should make us ponder the slippery topic of trust and “credit” in finance.

After their MBA, men earned on average $177,112, compared with $147,412 for women, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f8ca9da-9881-48fa-b3b4-419184fb853c\">according to new research</a>.</p> <h1>Film</h1> <p>Ahead of the release of the new James Bond movie <em>No Time to Die, </em>devotee Peter Aspden looks back on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6b420f2-68df-465c-a785-f4be348d1eee\">a six-decade love affair</a> with the franchise. “At best . . . Bond films skirt around genres with teasing elegance, perfectly balancing the thrilling with the comic, only occasionally allowing genuine emotional intensity to intrude. At worst the jokes fall flat, the action is laboured, the battle between good and evil infantilised.”</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, William Langley and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: US interest rate ‘lift off' moves a step closer ' FT.com 23 September.
