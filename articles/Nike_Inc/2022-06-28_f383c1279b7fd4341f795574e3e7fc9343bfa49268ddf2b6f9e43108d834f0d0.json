  "text": "<p>The major indexes in recent sessions have been highly sensitive to news and data as investors assess the durability of markets' bounce from lows.</p><p>The latest example came Tuesday when China's National Health Commission said it would loosen its strict quarantine requirements for international travelers, in an attempt to balance its zero-Covid policy against pressures it is facing on its economy, which is the world's second-largest. U.S. stock futures reversed earlier losses to trade higher after the news.</p><p>Major indexes pared some of their early gains after data from the Conference Board showed consumers' optimism cooled in June for the second consecutive month as Americans continue to assess the impact of high inflation and rising interest rates.</p><p>Fresh data released Tuesday morning showed that home-price growth slowed slightly in April. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the country, rose 20.4% in the year that ended in April, down slightly from a 20.6% annual rate in March. The index reports on a two-month delay. Earlier this month, mortgage rates reached the highest level in more than 13 years for two weeks in a row.</p><p>Travel and energy companies were bright spots in the market after the loosening of China's Covid quarantine. Occidental Petroleum climbed 5.8% and Devon Energy added 3.8%. Wynn Resorts gained 8.1% and Las Vegas Sands rose 7.5%.</p><p>Elsewhere, Nike fell 1.9% after the sneaker maker reported quarterly sales that were roughly flat and a decline in net income. Meanwhile, shares of Jefferies Financial Group rose 3.7% after the company reported a steep drop in profit in the second quarter as it faced a challenging capital markets environment.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced to 3.218%, from 3.193% Monday. Yields climb when bond prices fall. In general, Treasury yields have fallen in recent weeks as investors re-evaluated their expectations for the Fed's interest-rate hikes.</p><p>Oil prices climbed. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1.1% to $110.74 a barrel.</p><p>Bitcoin advanced from its 5 p.m. ET price Monday, gaining 0.7% to trade around $21,055.74, according to CoinDesk data.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.9%, driven higher by a rally in stocks including energy and manufacturing companies.</p><p>In Asia, indexes broadly rallied after China said it would loosen its strict quarantine requirements. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks closed 1% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.9%. Shares in airlines, restaurant chains and Macau casino operators surged.</p><p>â€”Quentin Webb contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Industrials Rise as China Eases Covid-19 Lockdowns</p>",
