When people are holding more money than they desire, they want to get rid of it. This would lower the price of most assets, but the nominal price of money is fixed: a dollar is a dollar. The adjustment comes via higher prices for everything else — or inflation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cd1d666-8842-4c82-8344-07c4e433a408\">writes Martin Wolf</a>.</p> <p><strong>Star wars: why Nasa objects to Elon Musk's space race</strong> The US space agency warns over the impact of SpaceX's plan to launch 30,000 more satellites into orbit for its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deaebceb-97ed-4022-84ad-e7057240afbf\">space-based broadband service</a>. Nasa says more satellites would make it harder to detect a “potentially catastrophic” asteroid strike on earth.</p> <p><strong>Silicon Valley has learnt little from Elizabeth Holmes </strong>While the Theranos founder awaits sentencing over defrauding investors, venture capital money continues to flow into wild start-up ideas. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66f11e1f-9ec9-406d-868f-d0f757a915d6\">No broader reckoning</a> has taken place. Instead of triggering tougher due diligence, the tech sector is dismissing the case as an outlier, writes Elaine Moore. </p> <p><strong>Real-world profits in the metaverse </strong>Retailers such as Forever 21, Nike and Chipotle are creating virtual world stores in a bet it can boost profits. But is it a gimmick, or will the metaverse allow for the creation of low-overhead, high-margin ecommerce businesses that will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed66a2a0-dfe6-41e9-9d09-64b71acc5e50\">transform global retail</a>?</p> <p><strong>Why does my boss write such rude emails? </strong>In the latest episode of the Working It podcast, host Isabel Berwick speaks to Erica Dhawan, an expert on digital communication, about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5943fe5d-739c-49cd-8061-c65af48eb61f\">good email etiquette and Zoom hygiene</a>.
