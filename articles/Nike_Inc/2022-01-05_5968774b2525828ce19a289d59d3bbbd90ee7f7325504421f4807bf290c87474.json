  "text": "<p>Nike NKE says the Mirror Home Gym and apps use technology that the sneaker giant invented and patented, including a device that prompts users to exercise, monitors their heart rate and collects data on their activity, among other functions, according to the lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Nike said it sent a notice to the yoga pants maker on Nov. 3, citing a list of patents it owned that were allegedly being used by the Mirror device and its apps. A response from Lululemon's lawyer, filed as an exhibit by Nike, said that after reviewing Nike's letter the company didn't believe that the Mirror or its apps were infringing on the patents.</p><p>“The patents in question are overly broad and invalid. We are confident in our position and look forward to defending it in court,” said a spokeswoman for Lululemon LULU in a statement. Nike didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Jeff Bezos' new year's disco style hits a nerve.</p><p>With Elizabeth Holmes's conviction, venture capitalists distance themselves from Theranos.</p>",
