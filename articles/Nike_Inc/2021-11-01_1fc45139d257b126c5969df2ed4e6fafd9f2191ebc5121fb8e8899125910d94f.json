  "title": "Why Lil Nas X Is the New King of Pop; The 22-year-old's single \"Old Town Road\" was a huge debut, and now he's one of the most streamed artists in the world. With his first album, \"Montero,\" he's blowing up the charts along with the old rules for success.",
  "text": "<p>The VMAs were the start to one of the more exciting weeks of the 22-year-old artist's life so far. He performed and won top awards at the show on September 12, then the next night posed on the Met Gala red carpet in three custom Versace looks, including a full set of armor and a sparkling gold bodysuit, and then released his debut album, Montero, at midnight on September 17. According to Spotify, he's now the fifth-most-streamed artist in the world on its platform, with almost 65 million monthly listeners. The album is nearing a collective two billion streams on Spotify less than one month after its release.</p><p>The past year has been a total rebuke to those who thought \"Old Town Road,\" the kid-friendly pop culture juggernaut he released in December 2018 while crashing on his sister's couch, would make him a one-hit wonder. By publicly embracing his queer identity, hopscotching musical genres seamlessly and playing social media like a game for keeps, Lil Nas X has surprisingly emerged as a generational talent, someone who continues to break ground.</p><p>Reflecting on the success of his album and his wild year, Nas lies completely down on the couch of a Los Angeles recording studio. He wears noisy black leather pants and a see-through red top, accessorized with a heavy chain with a jewel-encrusted butterfly at the neck. There are matching butterfly earrings, too. He's been clocking late hours in the studio recently working on a deluxe version of Montero, and he stayed up the night before watching Netflix's Squid Game in one straight marathon binge-watch. \"I'm at the best place I've ever been in life, but I always feel like I'm one step away from where I want to be,\" he says.</p><p>Actor Billy Porter, who starred as a priest in Nas's video for \"That's What I Want,\" sees a broader meaning in his success. \"The fact that Lil Nas X can be Black and queer and out and in your face is something that we've been fighting for for my entire life,\" Porter, 52, says. \"So to have lived long enough to see the day where there is someone like him in the marketplace is astonishing.\"</p><p>Part of what Nas wants to do is keep making statements. Throughout the past year, he's become adept at creating cultural moments that get more than just a passing mention. In June, there was his performance at the BET Awards, in which he kissed one of his backup dancers onstage. There was also the award-winning music video for \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name),\" in which he pole dances his way to hell and grinds on Satan before snapping the devil's neck.</p><p>Nas says a big part of this controversy-courting is intentional but wants his stunts to be jumping-off points for important topics. \"You take certain things like kissing a guy onstage: I know that's going to be something that's talked about. But let's get into the root cause of why it's being talked about,\" he says.</p><p>For weeks before his album came out, Nas pretended to be a pregnant celebrity, complete with a People magazine photo-spread of his prosthetic baby bump. He put up a \"baby registry\" of sorts, soliciting donations for a wide swath of charities in honor of his long-awaited album's release date. He says the experience provided an unexpected peek into how the world perceives trans men who get pregnant.</p><p>Then there were the Satan Shoes. In March, the Brooklyn-based art and marketing collective MSCHF customized a pair of black Nikes, each shoe allegedly filled with one drop of human blood, as a promotional tie-in for the \"Montero\" video and its devil scenes. The shoes sold out in seconds and later appeared on resale sites for thousands of dollars. It was a setup for cultural controversy, with conservative talk show hosts inveighing against the occult item's existence. Nas eventually got into a Twitter debate with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, whose take on the shoes included the phrase, \"We are in a fight for the soul of our nation.\" Nas answered back, \"ur a whole governor and u on here tweeting about some damn shoes. do ur job!\" In April, Nike settled a trademark lawsuit with MSCHF over the shoes, which Nas spun into more meme fodder, playing up a fictional trial and arrest.</p><p>Throughout the chaos, Nas found clever ways of directing people back to the video, like posting a clip on his YouTube page called \"Lil Nas X Apologizes for Satan Shoe\" that switched to the music video's most graphic scene after five seconds of setup. The song became his second No. 1 hit.</p><p>Nas says that unlike other planned moments, he didn't expect the flurry of attention that the shoes brought. His eyes light up as he recalls how a different keyword relating to the video trended on Twitter every single day of the week.</p><p>Twitter is where Nas goes to work and to play, but he also describes it as his home. After years of obsessive use, he now feels invincible on the platform. \"Anybody who tries to s— on me on Twitter, it's just not gonna work,\" he says. As a teenager, he would sneak his phone into class and spend time on Twitter. He ran the account @nasmaraj, posting as a superfan (or \"stan\") of rapper Nicki Minaj, eventually building up a six-digit following. The \"Nas\" from his handle worked its way into his stage name, eventually being joined by \"Lil\" and \"X.\" On the platform, he found a place where he belonged and where he could obsess about pop culture and crack jokes. He deleted the account and scrubbed the evidence of his online past when he started to generate his own fame, knowing the tweets that were on the account would out him as gay. Now he has stans of his own.</p><p>Nas, born Montero Lamar Hill, moved with his family from outside of Atlanta to the city's Bankhead Courts housing projects after his parents divorced, when he was 6 years old. He characterizes his childhood as chaotic, saying there were \"a lot of things going on around in the family—but I managed.\" When talking about growing up, his voice drops down to a whisper and he focuses on the number of diamond-encrusted rings on his fingers in the sunlight, making their reflection dance across the room. When I share some personal details from my life, he reaches out his hand to me and says, \"Trauma bonding\" in a singsong voice.</p><p>He enrolled at the University of West Georgia, which made him the first member of his family to go to college. He thought it would be better than high school, but he found it to be even more isolating. He was staying with his sister and some other siblings in Atlanta and about to drop out of school when he created \"Old Town Road.\"</p><p>He chronicles some of his early life issues on \"Dead Right Now\" from the new album, rapping that his father, who is a gospel singer, had doubts about him making it in the music industry. His friends and most trusted producers Denzel Baptiste and David Biral, who are professionally known as Take a Daytrip, say it was the last song for the album they started working on but the quickest to finish. The lyrics poured out of Nas once he heard the beat. \"A lot of the things were already on his mind, things that he wanted to speak about that he hadn't yet, and it just all came out at that moment,\" Biral says. \"We were just looking around at each other like, Wow, this is special.\"</p><p>His dad, who can actually be heard singing in the choir on the song, now frequently updates his Instagram account with praise of his son and his career, writing in May, \"I think you're making more than your fans PROUD of you.\"</p><p>The song is one of the heavier moments on the project, which also includes tracks that touch on heartbreak, alienation and suicidal ideation. Nas says he's dealt with thoughts of suicide in the past but says he'd never follow through. He says the past year and working on the album have taught him to deal with those feelings better, letting them flow through him and reminding himself of how much he's loved. For some of these songs, he dips into the angsty sounds of early aughts pop-punk, an unexpected twist that has been resonating with his fans.</p><p>Nas worked on the album throughout the pandemic with Take a Daytrip at Airbnbs in California. He says a pivotal moment in the process was trying psychedelic mushrooms for the first time. Baptiste and Biral sat by Nas's side sober and talked to him throughout the day, occasionally taking dips in the pool and hot tub but not working on any music, just reflecting on life. Nas loved the trip and says it allowed him to push past lots of lingering feelings of self-consciousness. \"I was able to open up a lot,\" he says. \"I was able to write actual stories about my life and put it into my music. I actually did that for the first time.\"</p><p>Rapper Jack Harlow, who appears with Nas on the song \"Industry Baby,\" says Nas's music is inspiring to him as a fellow performer. \"He makes me want to push boundaries,\" he says. \"He makes me not want to play it safe.\"</p><p>A question of where Nas, an openly gay, Black rapping pop star, fits in the music industry has been a sticking point since the early successes. \"Old Town Road\" first gained traction on the country charts but was received negatively by some genre die-hards. Eventually Billboard removed it from the genre-specific chart, deciding the cowboy tale didn't count as a country song. The remix of the song featuring country star Billy Ray Cyrus broke through the noise and launched the song to No. 1, where it stayed for a record-breaking 19 weeks, making it the longest-running Hot 100 single of all time.</p><p>In a now-deleted tweet sent in September, Nas voiced some frustration with never having been asked to guest on another rapper's song. While Montero features appearances from Harlow, Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat, some rappers have made unwelcoming or outright homophobic comments about Nas.</p><p>Harlow says he never hesitated to jump on a song with him. \"Working with him, I know what that's going to look like to me in 10 years and 20 years; I'm going to be very proud of it,\" Harlow says. \"I'm proud of it right now.\"</p><p>Rapper Kevin Abstract, who is gay and part of the rap group Brockhampton, thinks of Nas as a new type of superhero, noting his bold award-show performances: \"Being brave enough to do it in front of all these—really very tough macho rappers? To me, that's like the most hip-hop thing in the building.\"</p><p>Another significant co-sign came unexpectedly from Kanye West, who invited Nas to his studio this past year to hear some of the music that became West's album Donda. Nas was stunned, saying, \"Kanye, wants my opinion? Like, he's f—ing Kanye West.\" After hearing some of West's songs in progress, Nas played him some of the songs he was working on, and \"Industry Baby\" caught West's ear. He began to suggest some things and ended up with a producing credit on the song.</p><p>Nas says he wants to make sure his first feature for another artist is a special event, but knows that it's not a make-or-break moment. \"I didn't need a co-sign to get into the music industry, I don't need one to stay or anything,\" he says.</p><p>Nas says he wants to get into acting at some point but wants to continue working on music for the moment. He says that Rihanna is one of the people he'd most want to work with. After covering Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" and getting her public approval, he says he wants to make country music again, despite his earlier conflicts in the genre. He also wants to give away more of his newfound money, saying he doesn't really enjoy shopping for himself. When he signed his recording contract, he says he bought a Burberry jacket for about $2,000 and almost immediately regretted it: \"What was the point? To post it on Instagram once?\" He says the house he bought in California last year hasn't been filled with much furniture yet, and he'd rather take his friends or family members out on shopping sprees instead.</p><p>But he's also developed a better sense of what he doesn't want to do. For one, he doesn't want to date someone right now. Even though the video for \"That's What I Want,\" has him performing in a wedding dress and pining for someone to cuddle with, he just got out of a relationship and says he's not ready to date again. He laughs when he recalls that all of the exes he wrote about on the album were at his album release party. (He says only one of them took offense at the portrayal of their relationship on the album.)</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want to exist,\" he says. \"I want to have fun, I want to cause chaos sometimes. I want a long, legendary, fun life.\"</p><p>Why Lil Nas X Is the New King of Pop</p>",
