  "title": "Business News: Chinese Brand Gains In Sportswear Market",
  "text": "<p>In March, it got another boost. Chinese news outlets and social-media users called for a boycott of Western brands in an industry group that highlighted allegations about forced labor among minorities in China's cotton-rich Xinjiang region. Group members Adidas and Puma each reported third-quarter sales declines of about 15% in their Chinese markets, citing political challenges and other issues. Fellow member Nike Inc. said its sales there fell 20% in its latest quarter, though it pointed to supply-chain disruptions.</p><p>After the backlash, most Western fashion brands stopped talking about Xinjiang. Anta did the opposite to fall in line with Beijing, which calls the forced-labor allegations lies. Anta quit the group that raised the human-rights concerns, saying it would keep using Xinjiang cotton.</p><p>Anta, which declined to comment for this article, said revenue rose 56% in the first half of 2021 compared with the year-earlier period. In its latest financial report, it said \"guochao,\" a Chinese term meaning \"national tide,\" is making domestic brands more popular.</p><p>Companies that do business in China are walking the line between addressing human-rights concerns and acquiescing to Beijing, which can choke access to the world's second-biggest economy. H&amp;M Hennes and Mauritz AB disappeared from Chinese e-commerce sites and map apps last year after raising Xinjiang-related concerns.</p><p>A Nike spokeswoman declined to comment. Adidas didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>In industries such as sportswear, Chinese shoppers now have comparable homegrown alternatives such as Anta, which faces its own geopolitical challenges.</p><p>A human-rights group this week criticized the International Olympic Committee for its ties with Anta, the official supplier of IOC uniforms and other apparel for next month's Beijing Games.</p><p>The IOC said a third-party audit of its Anta-provided uniforms found no issues related to forced labor.</p><p>Ranking third in market share behind Nike and Adidas in China, Anta has narrowed the gap in recent years, according to research-firm Euromonitor.</p><p>Because of the size of China's sportswear market, valued at $50 billion a year and growing with the country's prosperity, Anta has become the world's fourth-biggest athletic-apparel company by market capitalization.</p>",
