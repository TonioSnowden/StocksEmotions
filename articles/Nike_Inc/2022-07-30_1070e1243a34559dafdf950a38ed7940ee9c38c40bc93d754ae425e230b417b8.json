  "title": "Obituaries: Sports Agent Struck Fear Into NFL Owners",
  "text": "<p>Phil Knight, a co-founder of Nike Inc., met Howard Slusher in 1975 when the lawyer and sports agent was negotiating a shoe-endorsement deal for the basketball player Paul Westphal. After enduring Mr. Slusher's relentless negotiating tactics, Mr. Knight turned to an aide and said, \"I want you to hire that son of a bitch.\"</p><p>The story, recounted in \"Just Do It,\" a 1994 book by Donald Katz, was confirmed by a Nike spokeswoman.</p><p>Mr. Slusher had stumbled into his career as a notoriously tough sports agent. Obsessed with sports, he played high-school football in Brooklyn but was too small to excel at higher levels. Instead, he made himself an expert on the psychology of sports, earned a law degree and taught at the University of Southern California.</p><p>One of his students, Jim Lawrence, a football player drafted by the New Orleans Saints in 1969, asked Mr. Slusher to help negotiate his contract. Mr. Slusher secured a deal providing financial protection in case of injuries, a clause that paid off when Mr. Lawrence wrecked a knee.</p><p>Soon Mr. Slusher was in demand among pro football players and other athletes. His clients often refused to practice or play until their teams coughed up. Because of his reddish hair and the fear he inspired in team owners, he was nicknamed Agent Orange.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, team owners and general managers denounced his tactics. One owner handed out pins reading \"Flush the Slush.\" Another called his negotiating demands \"almost sick.\"</p><p>Mr. Slusher said he wasn't telling the athletes what to do but explaining their options. Many became lifelong friends. One gave him a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow.</p><p>Nike's Mr. Knight for decades paid Mr. Slusher to handle difficult negotiations and oversee complicated projects.</p><p>Mr. Slusher, who lived in Lake Oswego, Ore., in recent years, died July 13. He was 85 years old.</p><p>Among his many clients were the football players Dan Fouts, Todd Bell and Lynn Swann. Rather than taking a percentage of their pay, he charged them an hourly fee, a practice he said was more beneficial to the players.</p><p>In a statement after Mr. Slusher's death, Mr. Knight said: \"Howard was first and foremost a negotiator. He made it an art form and did it better than anyone.\"</p><p>Mr. Slusher, who had been a cabdriver while in college, taught Mr. Knight how to get a lower taxi price at an airport: Approach the last driver in the queue and demand a steep discount.</p><p>In the 1960s, Mr. Slusher wrote a book, \"Man, Sport and Existence: A Critical Analysis,\" exploring why sports matter and what impels athletes to push themselves beyond their ordinary limits. \"To many,\" he wrote, \"sport becomes what religion was -- it serves as the prevailing attempt to keep order and loyalty.\"</p><p>Howard Sidney Slusher was born June 11, 1937, in Jersey City, N.J., and grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. His father was a salesman. Mr. Slusher recalled being toughened up by the need to fend off bullies, some wielding bicycle chains. One tormentor was so fierce that Mr. Slusher took sanctuary in a library after school. \"I figured while I was there I might as well read,\" he told People magazine in 1985.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
