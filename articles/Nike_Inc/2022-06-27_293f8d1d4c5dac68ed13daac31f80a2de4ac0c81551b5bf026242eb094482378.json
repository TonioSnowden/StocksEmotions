  "title": "Nike Posts Flat Sales, Jump in Inventories; Declining revenues in North America and China offset gains in Europe",
  "text": "<p>Matthew Friend, Nike's finance chief, said the company was monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of high inflation on demand. He said Nike would take a cautious approach in China given uncertainty around additional Covid-19 disruptions. He also said the company would be raising prices on some items by a mid-single-digit percentage.</p><p>\"We will stay focused on what we can control,\" Mr. Friend said on a conference call.</p><p>For the company's quarter ended May 31, total sales decreased 1% to $12.2 billion. Net income fell 5% to $1.44 billion, or 90 cents a share. The fiscal fourth-quarter results were better than Wall Street analysts had predicted. Shares of Nike slipped about 3% in late trading.</p><p>Revenue in the North American market, which accounts for the majority of total sales, declined 5% to $5.1 billion. Sales in China declined 19% to $1.56 billion, mostly because of Covid-19 restrictions in the country. Sales jumped in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia, compared with a year ago.</p><p>Some retailers have reported having excess inventory and having to sell products at a discount. Nike, however, has said in recent quarters that demand was outpacing supply and it was facing elevated freight costs and longer transit times. Conditions were already improving during the quarter ended Feb. 28, executives previously said.</p><p>Supply-chain disruptions are still having an impact on Nike's flow of goods, Mr. Friend said. The company is paying about five times the prepandemic rate it paid to put its products in a container and move them from Asia to the U.S. Transit times remain elevated and aren't expected to significantly improve during the coming fiscal year, he said.</p><p>The company reported a 23% increase in inventory in the May quarter, compared with the prior year. Mr. Friend said that extended production and shipping times caused about two-thirds of the company's inventory to be in transit at the end of the quarter.</p><p>For the new fiscal year, Mr. Friend predicted Nike's revenue would increase by a low double-digit percentage, excluding currency impacts. Revenue increased 5% to $46.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended May 31. For the current quarter, he forecast revenue would be flat to slightly above last year, due to Covid-19 disruptions in China and currency headwinds.</p><p>In the May quarter, Nike's direct-to-consumer sales increased 7% to $4.8 billion.</p><p>Last week, Nike said it plans to leave Russia, citing operational difficulties due to its invasion of Ukraine. Executives previously said business in both countries, which had been paused since March, represented less than 1% of Nike's total revenue.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Nike Posts Flat Sales, Jump in Inventories</p>",
