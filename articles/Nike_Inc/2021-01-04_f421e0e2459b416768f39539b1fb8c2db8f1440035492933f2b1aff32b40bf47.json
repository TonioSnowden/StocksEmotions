  "title": "PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY:  Time to Work Out From Home  ----  By Nicole Nguyen",
  "text": "<p>\n  In the Before Times, a postwork workout was a must. When the pandemic shut my gym and local yoga studio down, I turned to apps to get my routine back. So. Many. Apps. </p><p>\n  There are three basic categories of digital workouts: </p><p>\n   Freebies include free apps and YouTube workouts. These are great for getting your feet wet. YouTube is where you can try virtually any kind of workout. The downside is you have to spend time hunting for one, and that might keep you from exercising. </p><p>\n   Premium programs are like Netflixes for fitness. You pay between $5 and $25 a month, generally, to access a large library of on-demand workouts. These apps aim to be one-stop shops for exercise. </p><p>\n   Zoom studios are the virtual version of high-end bricks-and-mortar fitness offerings. They're pricey, but working out alongside others in real time and getting webcam-enabled instruction can be worth it. </p><p>\n  The key with any kind of exercise, of course, is showing up to do it. These are workouts I turned to again and again this year. But fitness is a highly personal thing -- and the instructors, music selection and exercise styles vary widely from app to app. For some, live classes are a good way to stay accountable. For others, short workouts that can be squeezed into a busy day are most important. </p><p>\n  My biggest advice: Take advantage of free trials before subscribing. (On iOS and Android, for \"free\" trials that require you to sign up, you can immediately unsubscribe to avoid being charged.) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Freebies </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Nike Training Club </p><p>\n  Platforms: iOS and Android </p><p>\n   What to like: The Nike Training Club app includes workouts focusing on strength, endurance and mobility. From yoga to body-weight cardio, there's something for every skill level. An integration with Apple Watch shows your heart rate, the upcoming drill and play/pause controls. </p><p>\n  Before the pandemic, premium \"trainer-led classes\" cost $15 a month or $120 annually. Nike made those 15- to 60-minute workouts free once so many people ended up stuck at home. </p><p>\n   Not so great: NTC doesn't come with music. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   The Body Project </p><p>\n  Fitness Blender </p><p>\n  Cycling with Kristina Girod </p><p>\n  Yoga with Adriene </p><p>\n  Platform: YouTube </p><p>\n   What to like: YouTube videos are a good way to try out different styles of fitness before committing to a program. I like these channels because they offer variety and regularly upload new content. A paid membership unlocks additional workouts and coaching. </p><p>\n   Not so great: You'll sit through the occasional ad, and there's no option to download workouts to do offline. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Premium Programs </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Peloton Digital </p><p>\n  Price: $13 a month </p><p>\n  Free trial: One month </p><p>\n  Platforms: iOS, Android, web, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Android TV </p><p>\n   What to like: A subscription includes live-streamed classes and Peloton's library covering 11 disciplines, such as cycling, strength training, yoga and meditation. The app's music-themed classes span a range of genres and the instructors provide motivation and tips on form. You can see which users are doing a workout alongside you and send or receive digital high-fives. </p><p>\n  The experience is best with some equipment (such as weights or a basic stationary bike paired with a cadence sensor). But the outdoor running feature is my favorite. The audio-guided workouts are led by pros, peppered with tips, and set to music that matches the interval's effort. </p><p>\n   Not so great: While classes can be preloaded, you can't take them offline. So if your at-home gym is a Wi-Fi-less basement, Peloton isn't a good choice. App users also can't see how their metrics compare with other members' -- the leaderboard is exclusive to those who own the company's bike ($1,895 and up) and treadmill ($2,495 and up), plus pay for the all-access $39-a-month membership. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Apple Fitness+ </p><p>\n  Price: $10 a month/$80 a year </p><p>\n  Free trial: One month </p><p>\n  Platforms: iPhone, iPad, Apple TV HD (fourth generation) or Apple TV 4K </p><p>\n   What to like: With one subscription, everyone in your iCloud household (up to six people) gets access to the on-demand library. There's studio-style cycling, interval training, treadmill runs, yoga, core, strength, rowing and dancing, plus \"mindful cool-downs\" (aka stretching). All of the workouts include modifications for beginner and intermediate practitioners. The sessions are short -- the longest are 45 minutes. </p><p>\n   Not so great: The program is for Apple Watch owners (Series 3 and newer) only. The service is hard to find, as a new tab inside Apple's Fitness app. You can't stream the workouts through Apple's AirPlay, which is supported by some TVs and streaming boxes; you'll need a newer Apple TV to watch workouts on your TV. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Obe Fitness </p><p>\n  Price: $27 a month, $65 a quarter, $199 a year </p><p>\n  Free trial: One week </p><p>\n  Platforms: iOS, web, Roku, Amazon Fire TV </p><p>\n   What to like: There are 22 live classes a day, taught by friendly instructors. There's a backlog of thousands of on-demand videos. In live classes, instructors often shout out users by name -- though they can't see you. The workouts are focused on disciplines like barre, sculpt, dance and Pilates. Cardio boxing and the trampoline-assisted \"bounce\" workout are two of the more unique offerings. There are workouts tailored for children (with a Kidz Bop soundtrack) and seniors (featuring low-impact chair exercises). The \"workout party\" feature lets you share the experience with seven friends over video chat. </p><p>\n   Not so great: The workouts feature one type of music -- a generic upbeat mix with popular hits sprinkled in -- and there's no option to toggle music off. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Alo Moves </p><p>\n  Price: $20 a month/$199 a year </p><p>\n  Free trial: Two weeks </p><p>\n  Platforms: iOS, Android, web, Apple TV, Chromecast </p><p>\n   What to like: Alo Moves features different types of flow yoga plus yoga-themed strength, barre and Pilates classes. I like the multiday series, focused on one workout type, where each class builds on the next. The guided meditations are excellent. </p><p>\n   Not so great: Alo Moves' large library can be overwhelming, and the class names (e.g. \"Drop In\" and \"Coming Home\") aren't always informative. The beginner offerings are minimal. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Zoom Studio </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Barry's At-Home </p><p>\n  Price: $20 a class; $70 for 5 classes; $120 for 10 classes </p><p>\n  Free trial: None </p><p>\n  Platforms: Zoom </p><p>\n   What to like: The boot-camp fitness chain went virtual with its workout. You can choose from Barry's signature treadmill and weights classes as well as body weight, resistance bands and weights. The instructor-led, 45-minute sessions are live, and participants can switch their webcams on to get personalized adjustments. </p><p>\n   Not so great: There are occasionally technical difficulties. (Zoom requires strong Wi-Fi on both ends.) While first-timers get two classes for the price of one, there isn't a trial period. </p><p></p>",
