Join FT columnist Simon Kuper on May 25 at 15.30 BST/10:30 EST for a conversation with journalist David de Jong on his groundbreaking investigation of how the Nazis helped German tycoons make billions from the horrors of the Third Reich. Register for free <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/406844\">here</a>. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Is this the end of the single-manager mentality? </h2> <p>At DD we've written often about the descendants of hedge fund king <strong>Julian Robertson</strong>'s <strong>Tiger Management</strong> and the diverging fortunes of the so-called “Tiger cubs”.</p> <p>On one end of the spectrum, you've got <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acc0158d-77cd-422d-b8be-d3ae64b588a1\">arrested</a> by US authorities last month and charged with racketeering, securities fraud, wire fraud and market manipulation following the implosion of his family office <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong>.</p> <p>On the other end there is <strong>Chase Coleman</strong>, who has spent the past several decades building <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\"><strong>Tiger Global</strong></a> into the largest and most successful hedge fund of any of his fellow cubs. </p> <p>But no matter where they've ended up, most of the pack have deployed a long-short playbook, placing big bets on tech and shorting underperforming stocks. </p> <p>Now, the model <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a393020-4c43-4bd8-8a88-221459bcee58\">has come back to bite</a>. Tiger Global has bled around $17bn so far this year as rising interest rates puncture its bets on companies such as <strong>Peloton</strong> and<strong> Zoom</strong>. Nearly two-thirds of the dollar gains it has generated for investors since its 2001 launch have been erased.</p> <p>Coleman isn't the only star manager whose shine has been dulled by the tech sell-offs. <strong>Melvin Capital Management</strong>, the hedge fund that lost billions of dollars in last year's meme-stock rally, has told clients that it is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/74ee1f19-1cdc-4cb8-941e-7d035cf86faf\">winding down its funds</a>, according to a letter to investors seen by DD.</p> <p>“I have given everything I could, but more recently that has not been enough to deliver the returns you should expect. I now recognise that I need to step away from managing external capital,” the New York-based firm's founder<strong> Gabe Plotkin</strong> wrote.</p> <p>“If you owned growth stocks this year . . . you got your face ripped off,” <strong>Brad Gerstner</strong>, founder of tech-focused fund<strong> Altimeter Capital Management</strong>, wrote on Twitter this month, adding that his firm “didn't hedge enough” and “moved too slow”.</p> <p>Not all hedge funds have been caught flat-footed by tech sell-offs. So-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/241505c0-daf8-4ea7-b727-b0ba774c00fa\">multi-manager funds</a>, such <strong>Izzy Englander</strong>'s <strong>Millennium Management</strong> and <strong>Ken Griffin</strong>'s <strong>Citadel</strong> have benefited from employing multiple teams of traders and diversifying across a range of strategies and asset classes. </p> <p>The strategy has enabled them to be nimbler in the face of the market mayhem brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, meme-stock mania and now tumbling tech shares. </p> <p>Coleman has diversified in his own way, gaining notoriety in recent years for his hard-and-fast <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">start-up investing tactics</a> that have upset the clubby ranks of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. <strong>Coatue </strong>and other cub-run funds such as <strong>Lee Ainslie</strong>'s <strong>Maverick Capital</strong> and<strong> Andreas Halvorsen</strong>'s <strong>Viking</strong> have also been dabbling in private markets.</p> <p>But no matter how far Coleman and his fellow cubs veer from traditional hedge fund structures, centring their entire strategy on one manager's vision has proved problematic.</p> <p>The resilience of funds such as Millennium and Citadel might suggest that multi-manager funds are the new master stockpickers.</p> <h2>London tries to mitigate fintech flight risk</h2> <p>Earlier this year, London's IPO market was dealt a devastating blow: <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, Europe's biggest private equity firm, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/831a0d91-ee4d-476c-bd69-8d87c533065f\">drew up plans</a> for a public debut on Amsterdam's <strong>Euronext</strong> exchange instead of choosing the UK capital, where it has its most significant presence. </p> <p>It wasn't the first time a sought-after listing has given London the cold shoulder post-Brexit, which has complicated the regulatory landscape and intensified rivalries between the UK and EU markets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, London's private investment sphere has been hot. Tech start-ups in London raised a record $25.5bn in funding last year, more than double the total in 2020, as the number of British “unicorns” climbed to 75, including car insurance start-up <strong>Marshmallow </strong>and fintech firm <strong>Starling Bank</strong>.</p> <p>The latest fintech darling to come on to the London scene is cloud banking start-up <strong>Thought Machine</strong>, which offers its cloud-based banking infrastructure “Vault” to more than 35 banks globally.</p> <p>The company has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce266a7b-f474-47e5-b7bf-067d34b241a1\">doubled its valuation to $2.7bn</a> in a funding round. Its backers are a mash-up of institutional investors and major banks ⁠ — many of which are also its own clients ⁠ — including<strong> JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>.</p> <p><br>But that doesn't mean it'll ultimately pick the UK for an IPO. Start-ups worth a total of $88bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56eb7094-63ff-49dd-a453-3cdd89a9a2ed\">left London to list elsewhere</a> last year.</p> <p>The UK government is hoping to change that, with plans for a new regulatory framework announced in the financial services and markets bill, introduced as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/304cf92e-1b29-4049-bab7-f6640486bca4\">Queen's Speech</a> last week.</p> <p>Thought Machine could be an important test of the success or otherwise of that strategy. It has an IPO timeline of around three years, its founder and chief<strong> Paul Taylor</strong> told the FT, adding that London is a strong contender.</p> <h2>Private lenders grease Peloton's wheels</h2> <p>Early on in HBO's <em>Sex and the City </em>reboot, “Mr Big” set off on a Peloton ride from which he would never return.</p> <p>The beleaguered fitness group, which has sweated its way through various PR disasters, steep losses and a dwindling cash pile (with<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29e18453-dfea-4236-a18c-2c3a018a843a\"> rusty hardware</a> to boot), may not suffer the same fate after all.</p> <p>Private lenders including <strong>Blackstone </strong>and<strong> Apollo </strong>have joined public loan investors to relieve some of the pressure on Peloton's balance sheet with<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1556db17-8b2a-4b87-b749-f874a0ecf024\"> $750mn of new debt</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>These so-called hybrid deals, where financing is sourced from both private and public markets, are becoming<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0906f8c4-fb8a-4678-9f6a-aca873b9fa62\"> increasingly common</a> as private debt investors such as Apollo swoop in to provide cash in volatile markets that other asset managers may deem too risky — all for a higher interest rate than corporate borrowers would typically pay bondholders, naturally.</p> <p>The private debt industry's assets have swelled to $1.2tn, according to<strong> Preqin</strong> data.</p> <p>It is another sign, alongside Elon Musk's financing package for his (now less probable) $44bn Twitter takeover, that the mix of syndicated debt and private capital is fast replacing the traditional buyout model. </p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Nike</strong>'s head of diversity<strong> Felicia Mayo </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30467987-add6-4d61-b7eb-a2b88f0a3099\">will leave the company</a> at the end of July, according to an internal email and people familiar with the matter. She joined from <strong>Tesla</strong> in 2019 and is the second Nike executive to leave the role in a two-year period.</p></li>  <li><p>Former<strong> Metro Bank </strong>chair <strong>Vernon Hill</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65b34666-da65-4e08-8316-2832b4586240\">asking a federal court</a> to block a move by his boardroom adversaries to oust him as chair of the US bank <strong>Republic First Bancorp</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>BNP Paribas</strong> has promoted<strong> Dimitri Jobert </strong>as head of financial sponsors coverage for the Americas, based in New York.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has named<strong> Dion Di Miceli</strong> as head of investment banking coverage of investment companies for its UK corporate broking team and <strong>Andrew Davies</strong> as head of equity sales activity for investment firm clients. They join from <strong>Gravis Capital Management </strong>and<strong> Liberum Capital</strong>, respectively.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Lehman Brothers lingers on </strong>The bank that collapsed 14 years ago is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-lehman-brothers-collapse-plan-repay-after-bankruptcy/?sref=OziMsGoK\">still haunting Wall Street</a> as its lawyers, accountants and consultants sort through what is left of the mess, Bloomberg writes.</p> <p><strong>Taming the bull</strong> Rising yields and interest rates have finally slowed the bond bull market after a three-decade run.
