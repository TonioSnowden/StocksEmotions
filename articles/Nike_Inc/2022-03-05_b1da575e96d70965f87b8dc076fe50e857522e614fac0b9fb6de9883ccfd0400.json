  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Style & Fashion -- 20 Odd Questions:  Gabriela  Hearst  ---  Before her fashion shows in New York and  Paris, the designer talked magic, mezcal  and her go-to chocolates 'in times of need'  ----  By Marshall Heyman",
  "text": "<p>\n  Gabriela Hearst might be the only ready-to-wear designer who studies fusion and clean energy in her spare time. That is, when she has spare time. </p><p>\n  The Uruguay-born Ms. Hearst, 45, juggles heading up her New York-based eponymous line, which she founded in 2015, and her role as the creative director of Paris brand Chloe, which she took on in 2020. (Her fall 2022 collection for that brand debuted on March 3.) Ms. Hearst's dual gigs require frequent travel between Paris and New York -- sometimes twice a month. To cope, she has learned to get work done whenever (and wherever) she has a free moment. She sketches collections on trans-Atlantic flights. </p><p>\n  \"It's like the life of an athlete, but I sleep eight hours a night. I have an Oura Ring,\" Ms. Hearst said, referring to the trendy sleep tracker. \"Everything in my life is about my passion, my mission and my family. I don't have too many fun nights. Maybe four of those a year, maximum.\" </p><p>\n  Those rare evenings will \"for sure\" include good food. \"I'm Latin, and you cannot come to a place where the food is no good.\" Also, mezcal and \"amazing friends with unpretentious vibes.\" </p><p>\n  Just a few days before her signature brand's New York runway show in February, Ms. Hearst, dressed casually in a beanie of her own design, logged on to Zoom to discuss her love of jewelry, country music and her many \"witchy\" proclivities. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I consider myself: a witch. I'm the daughter of one. I don't do spells, but I have a wish list. Some people call it visualization. I've used wish lists for years. I get a lot of what I want. I put things out there with my magic and hope people around can make it happen, too. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  If I'm going to drink alcohol: it's going to be mezcal. I like Ilegal and Agua Magica. I love it when they're a little aged and have that golden flavor. It's the drink of witches, if you ask me. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I just read: \"The Ministry for the Future\" [about climate change]. It's science fiction, but I would call it science prediction. . . . I suffer climate anxiety and I believe fusion energy is a solution for clean energy by 2030. I want to learn everything I can about it. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I grew up: on a ranch [in Uruguay]. My mom's family has been there for 170 years. She still lives there, off the grid. She used to compete in the rodeo. Then she became a taekwondo black belt. Then she was a Zen Buddhist. She defies structures of how powerful women should behave. I admire her, but she's also embarrassed me. She would pick me up from school in her taekwondo outfit. I spent my teenage years being completely mortified. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I have always preferred: stationery stores to fashion boutiques. As a kid, my favorite time was when the school year started and we had to buy pens and pencils. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I drew: 32 sketches for the new Chloe collection on the plane trip back from Paris. I don't know if they're good or bad. I try to keep ego out of the [creativity] equation. I follow where my curiosity drives me. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I take notes: with [Pilot] pens and I sketch with pencils. I don't like using erasers on the back of pencils so I always have a Caran d'Ache or Faber-Castell eraser. I like classic brands. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I go through: around seven notebooks a month. For Chloe, I use notebooks from Aspinal of London. For Gabriela Hearst, I use small ones by Fashionary. Inside my notebooks, there will be an article about climate change I cut out, a design note, a drawing that I saw or something that I dreamt and notes about fusion energy. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Among my favorite hotels are: the Aman Tokyo, the Bristol in Paris and the Carlyle in New York -- the bar is a scene. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I'm obsessed with: cherries and chocolate. Charbonnel et Walker's dark chocolate [ceri-settes] with cherries and [cherry liqueur] inside are insane. They only sell them in London. They're for special times of need. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My twin teenage daughters are into: a pinstripe suit I made for the Gabriela Hearst show before Covid. My kids are getting more excited about my closet. I feel like it's a victory. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  One of my coolest garments is: a Manchester United official team Nike shirt that is probably 20 years old. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  On walks, I love listening to: country music. Lately I've been playing \"Sleeping on the Blacktop\" by Colter Wall, \"Clay Pigeons\" by Blaze Foley and music by Ryan Bingham. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Energetically speaking: it's good to have a stone close to your skin. I [recently] strung ruby beads very simply into a necklace. I like how it feels on my body. I love jewelry. I make these one-ounce rings that have a hidden precious stone. I like things that have secrets. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My weekly regimen includes: Reiki and acupuncture. My acupuncturist tells me I'm like a Formula One car. He has to calibrate me, and then I'm ready. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I was a terrible: model. At 21, I was already too old. I looked very androgynous. I shaved my head, and I liked that people could confuse me with a guy. Modeling taught me rejection. Most of the time you don't get the gigs. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I was also not a good: actress. I studied acting for two years at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Acting teaches you to be honest, to reach for authenticity all the time. I couldn't do my job without that training. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I've been watching: \"Yellowstone.\" I understand these people: It's about ranch life. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I'm a very: impulsive person, so I use the Osho Zen Tarot app to slow myself down. I ask it, Should I post this picture on Instagram? Should I send this email? But is it the universe or the algorithm talking to me? I'm doubtful. I'm going to buy an actual tarot deck instead. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A few years ago, I discovered: the skin-care brand Biologique Recherche, and I've stuck with it. I use the Lotion P50 and La Grand Creme. Sometimes I'll get a facial from Sarah Smith in New York. She's a master. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My dream dinner party would include: the young Bob Dylan. He was so sexy. And I'd love to have Miles Davis but he wouldn't come, unless I also invited Jimi Hendrix -- [Davis] went to his funeral. I'd make sure the alcohol was good. I think they'd like picking food, tapas style. </p><p>\n  -- Edited from an interview by Marshall Heyman </p><p></p>",
