  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Sweetgreen Sticks With Osaka Endorsement",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Osaka's manager told Sweetgreen that she planned to leave the tournament roughly an hour before the social-media post announcing her withdrawal was published, said Nathaniel Ru, a Sweetgreen co-founder and chief brand officer.</p><p>\"We were really moved by the vulnerability of it, and how honest it was,\" Mr. Ru said.</p><p>Her decision reverberated around the globe and put Sweetgreen's founders in unfamiliar territory. They had never struck a big endorsement deal with an athlete, let alone a young one suddenly making international news. The three founders -- Mr. Ru, Nicolas Jammet, and Jonathan Neman -- that evening decided to stand with Ms. Osaka and her choice to speak so openly about mental health.</p><p>They wrote in a Twitter post Monday that their partnership with Ms. Osaka reflected all forms of wellness and that they were proud to work with her. A day later they sent an email to brand supporters proclaiming Ms. Osaka \"the real green goddess,\" and praised her for standing up for her beliefs.</p><p>Sweetgreen's embrace of Ms. Osaka's decision shows how much celebrity endorsements, and athlete's personas, have changed. Years ago, an activist athlete might have been a headache for companies expecting a celebrity to attract as many customers as possible with neutral messaging and mass appeal. Nike Inc.-backed basketball legend Michael Jordan scrupulously maintained his image in the press and avoided politics, refusing to endorse Democratic North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt in 1990 with the comment: \"Republicans buy sneakers too.\"</p><p>Many companies are now pursuing \"purpose-driven marketing,\" industry experts say, seeking to demonstrate their commitment to improving society, as well as customers' meals or cleaning routines. Americans, meanwhile, are placing more trust in the values a company projects. More than half of 2,000 adults surveyed recently by market-research firm Mintel said they consider buying from brands they view as ethical -- a form of activism.</p><p>And athlete activism has also grown, especially around the tumultuous summer of 2020, with mental-health advocacy, a cause embraced by athletes in sports including gymnastics, track and swimming. For some athletes, such activism extends to striking deals with brands that they say support them in their advocacy and their personal lives. \"What drew me to Athleta is that they don't only care that we're an athlete but they truly care about how we're doing as individuals and what we want to accomplish outside the sport,\" gymnast Simone Biles told The Wall Street Journal in April when she said she was leaving Nike for the Gap. Inc.-owned brand.</p><p>Ms. Osaka, the No. 2 women's tennis player in the world, has won prize money and endorsement deals from companies such as Nike and Mastercard Inc. worth more than $50 million. She has also been an outspoken advocate for social causes. She forced a suspension of her semifinal match during the Western &amp; Southern Open last summer to protest police violence against Black people following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. She wore face masks bearing the names of Black victims of racist violence or police brutality during the U.S. Open.</p><p>\"Something like this can often widen the aperture for deals\" between athletes and brands, said Rob Temple, a former ESPN executive who worked extensively on sponsorships. Mr. Temple pointed out how tennis star Serena Williams secured more endorsement deals after becoming a mom; she also opened up about nearly dying after the birth of her daughter in 2017.</p><p>Mr. Ru said a mutual friend introduced him and Sweetgreen's other founders to Ms. Osaka late last year after they learned that she was a fan of its salads and bowls. They talked with her about food and wellness. She spent time at the company's test kitchen in Culver City, Calif., in the Los Angeles area, where she has a home. Across several visits, she helped create the bowl, participated in tastings and brought her sister during one visit to try it as well, Sweetgreen said.</p><p>\"She really wanted to be there, and we just get really excited by that,\" Mr. Ru said.</p><p>Mr. Ru, 36 years old, founded Sweetgreen 14 years ago with two fellow graduates of Georgetown University's business school. The privately held company, valued at $1.78 billion during its last funding round in January, operates 126 fast-casual restaurants, many of them catering to office workers in city centers. Sweetgreen has featured musician Kendrick Lamar and chef David Chang in its marketing. Recently, it has aimed to reach younger customers, including through cooking videos on TikTok.</p><p>Ms. Osaka, at 23, is one Generation Z's best-known athletes. Sweetgreen last month said she had become its youngest investor and first national athlete ambassador. The company wouldn't disclose financial terms of the yearlong partnership. The deal didn't stipulate that she play in championship tennis matches, Mr. Ru said.</p><p>The Sweetgreen bowl that bears her name -- a medley of quinoa, spinach, tortilla chips,blackened chicken and other ingredients -- is based on what she normally orders there, Mr. Ru said.</p><p>\"Anyone that knows me knows I've been into Sweetgreen for a while. I eat it three times a week when I'm training, at shoots,\" she wrote last month to her more than three million Twitter and Instagram followers.</p><p>---</p><p>Louise Radnofsky and Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.</p>",
