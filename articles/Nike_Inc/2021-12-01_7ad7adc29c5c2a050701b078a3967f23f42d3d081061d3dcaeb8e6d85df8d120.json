  "title": "Virgil Abloh Show for Louis Vuitton in Miami Was a Memorial and Joyous Celebration; The late designer's collection was on display at a celebration of his life before a crowd including Kanye West, Venus Williams and Ivanka Trump",
  "text": "<p>The staging of Louis Vuitton's spring 2022 men's collection Tuesday on a barge off the Miami coastline was never going to be a muted affair. With over 1,000 RSVPs, a sunset call time and an Instagram-worthy skyline backdrop, it was envisioned as a marquee event of Art Basel, the art fair and dayslong party taking place in Florida this week.</p><p>But when Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton's men's artistic director since 2018, died Sunday following a private battle with cardiac angiosarcoma, the show was injected with a profound poignancy. As the 41-year-old Mr. Abloh's penultimate show for the French luxury house, it became a communal celebration of a designer whose creative output encompassed everything from coveted logo hoodies under his own Off-White label to IKEA rugs to rap album covers.</p><p>In an emotional speech before the show, Michael Burke, chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton, said that, until Saturday evening, Mr. Abloh \"talked with passion about the finer details of the show...he had imagined it all and he was distraught not to be here to experience it with us in person.\" Archie Lee Coates IV, a partner in PlayLab, the design studio that handled show direction and set design for Mr. Abloh's Louis Vuitton runway shows, said a few adjustments were made following the designer's death, which caught even Mr. Coates IV off guard, but the show was for the most part Mr. Abloh's vision. </p><p>The runway presentation included jackets in jolting green hues.

It was a jubilant, blown-out affair—to call it a mere fashion show would be selling it short—encompassing a boat ride to the venue, a runway presentation in the shadow of the eroding grandstands of a speedboat racetrack and a concert by musicians like Kid Cudi, who also walked in the show, and Erykah Badu. Outside the perimeter of the stage stood a cherry-red \"LV\"-branded hot-air balloon and a roughly three-story-tall, rainbow-tinted statue of Mr. Abloh, gazing optimistically toward the skies. The luminous, looming statue had been in the works well before the event, but took on new weight following the designer's death.</p><p>The event was a reunion for those who'd had a front-row seat to Mr. Abloh's all-too-short career. The rapper Kanye West, whom Mr. Abloh met in Chicago and interned alongside at Fendi in 2009, arrived with his wife, Kim Kardashian, and daughter North. Silvia Venturini Fendi, the designer with whom the two had interned, was also in attendance. As was Nigo, the illustrious Japanese designer and recently appointed artistic director of Kenzo. Nigo introduced Mr. Burke to Mr. Abloh in Tokyo 15 years ago, as Mr. Burke noted in his speech, describing the future fashion pacesetter as \"a shy young man.\"</p><p>In an industry where designers often maintain an image of being closed-off artistes, Mr. Abloh had a reputation for being a fast friend, quick to send an encouraging Instagram DM to anyone whose work caught his eye. \"He was all about uplifting,\" Mr. Coates said. </p><p>Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West and North West posing beneath a statue of the late designer.

Indeed, for many young Black voices in the fashion industry, Mr. Abloh—the first Black American to be named an artistic director at a European luxury house—established the template of what success could look like.</p><p>The attendees included many of Mr. West's admirers and past collaborators. There was the designer Tremaine Emory, who just days ago released a series of embroidered and painted jeans in partnership with Mr. Abloh. Venus Williams, who was a supporter of Mr. Abloh's and whose sister Serena frequently wore uniforms of Mr. Abloh's design on the tennis circuit, sat in the front row. Rappers such as 21 Savage, Lil Baby and Gunna arrived in the finest of Louis Vuitton fineries (most notably, Gunna's beguiling monogrammed poncho), providing a walking homage to the late designer's work. The It-couple of the moment, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, were also in attendance. As were Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who recently relocated to Florida and were seen talking with members of the Arnault family, which owns LVMH, the conglomerate that encompasses Louis Vuitton.</p><p>According to a Louis Vuitton publicist, about two-thirds of the show's gigantic guest list consisted of upper-tier Louis Vuitton customers. Many attendees arrived wearing head-to-toe outfits of Mr. Abloh's Louis Vuitton designs, collectively showcasing a glittery—if a bit gaudy—array, and excitedly dissected each other's outfits with questions such as, \"Oh, what season is that jacket?\"</p><p>Father and son Brian and Marquis Bailey came up from Washington, D.C., for the show. The elder Mr. Bailey, 51, a real-estate developer, said that he had been a Louis Vuitton shopper for 29 years, but when Mr. Abloh came on board, he became even more interested in the brand, noting that he'd upped his spending by a factor of four. He speculated that in the past two-to-three years he has spent close to a million dollars on Louis Vuitton designs. \"I ended up loving the brand even more, because of [Virgil's] artistic expression,\" said Mr. Bailey, who was wearing an ornately logoed blazer and flamingo-pink sneakers of Mr. Abloh's creation. </p><p>A guest wearing a T-shirt with Virgil Abloh's image.

The pair said they'd purchased both outfits just the day before, entirely to splash out for the event. Each outfit cost, in the words of Mr. Justin, \"a little, light $12,000.\"</p><p>Dennis Brodsky, 43, a retired stay-at-home dad in Orlando, Fla., who was dressed in a relatively restrained brown-leather Louis Vuitton jacket, was more focused on the purchases he was plotting to make after seeing the show. \"I'm in awe,\" he said, \"the looks are amazing, it's mesmerizing.\" He said he was particularly keen on ordering all of the collaborative Nike Air Force Ones that were on display.</p><p>Those already-coveted sneakers are sure to sell out, but hype aside, the overall collection on display Tuesday night was Mr. Abloh's strongest work for Vuitton. The clothes ensured that the runway show wasn't a somber occasion, but instead was uplifting, forward-thinking and downright fun. Models wore rainbow-colored fur hats, futuristic metallic trucker jackets, swinging men's skirts and surrealistic checkerboard suits. At the close of the show, the Louis Vuitton design team came out to take a bow in Mr. Abloh's absence. Then a recording of the designer's voice resonated throughout the venue: \"There's no limit, life is so short that you can't waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do.\"</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at Jacob.Gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Virgil Abloh Show for Louis Vuitton in Miami Was a Memorial and Joyous Celebration</p>",
