  "text": "<p>One day in May last year, hundreds of people marching through the picturesque city of Burlington, Vermont, stopped to shout outside the Ben &amp; Jerry's Scoop Shop. “The only word they were screaming was ‘shame',” says Wafic Faour, a veteran campaigner with local group Vermonters for Justice in Palestine. </p> <p>The rally was to commemorate a distant event: the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the 1948 creation of the state of Israel, known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. To Faour, the march marked a turning point in a campaign to address one of the world's most long-lasting conflicts via the state of Vermont's most famous company.</p> <p>Two months later, Ben &amp; Jerry's announced it intended to end its franchise deal in Israel at the end of 2022 as a means of stopping its product being sold in occupied Palestinian territories, which Faour's campaign had argued made the ice-cream maker complicit in an occupation deemed illegal under international law. </p> <p>But the announcement placed the brand at odds with its parent company, Unilever — and with the government of Israel, which threatened Unilever with “severe consequences”. Opponents, including Israel's economics minister, filmed themselves throwing tubs of Ben &amp; Jerry's in the bin. Jewish groups accused Ben &amp; Jerry's and Unilever of singling out Israel for criticism. </p> <p>More than a year later, the conflict continues to rage. Ben &amp; Jerry's independent board has taken Unilever to court over an attempt to continue Israeli sales. At the end of September, it expanded its legal action to target Unilever in London as well as its US subsidiary. Unilever has until the start of November to respond to the latest accusations in court, while the dispute could taint the tenure of Unilever's next chief executive, after Alan Jope announced he would retire next year.</p> <p>The fight pitches a multinational that has long emphasised its commitment to ethics and sustainability against a subsidiary with an even louder voice. It also raises questions about the limits of corporate ethics as companies come under pressure to take stands on sensitive public issues from climate change to Black Lives Matter. </p> <p>Others to have fallen foul of the increasingly febrile atmosphere include Disney, whose initial decision <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4e84eac-8502-4a7f-b51b-c372752b4b38\">not to take a stand</a> on Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay bill was reversed after outrage from employees. H&amp;M and Nike faced a backlash in China last year after expressing concern over reports of forced labour in the Xinjiang region.</p> <p>But Joanne Ciulla, director of the Institute for Ethical Leadership at Rutgers business school, says this case is unusual in one respect: “You rarely have ethical company against ethical company, disagreeing on what's ethical . . . companies do have to pick their battles and it sounds like this is a battle [Unilever] don't want to fight.”</p> <h1>Searching for euphoria</h1> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's was founded in 1978 in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, a state with a strong history of liberal activism. Founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield came of age during the 1960s, part of “a diaspora of baby boomers who converged on Burlington in search of euphoria”, according to Brad Edmondson's history of the company, <em>Ice Cream Social.</em></p> <p>The long-haired pair slept in their scoop shop during their first summer of operation, testing out ice-creams with chunks of candy, nuts, cookies and other foods thrown into the mix. The resulting concoctions were lumpy, eccentric and hugely popular: sales ballooned from less than $1mn in 1982 to more than $58mn seven years later. </p> <p>As the company grew, it developed a three-part mission, encompassing ice-cream, sustainable economic growth and social improvements. It campaigned on issues as wide ranging as climate change and bovine growth hormone. In 1988 it began selling “Peace Pops” as part of a bid to divert 1 per cent of the US defence budget to cultural and economic exchanges with the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, amid consolidation in the ice-cream sector, and with Ben &amp; Jerry's share price languishing, its board opted to pursue a sale, despite scepticism from the founders. In 2000, Ben &amp; Jerry's was sold to Unilever for $326mn. At the time Cohen said he would have preferred the brand to remain independent, but quoted the Grateful Dead song “Scarlet Begonias”: “Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.”</p> <p>Central to his support was a deal to put in place an independent board to protect the brand's social mission and integrity. Despite owning the group and choosing its chief executive, Unilever would select only a minority of directors, with the independent board members nominating their own successors. </p> <p>“It's a really unusual agreement. Most companies when they sell out, they sell out in every sense,” says marketing consultant Peter Field. One other Unilever brand, Seventh Generation, has its own social mission board, but without the same independence. </p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's was one of the last Unilever brands to add the group's logo to its packaging. But with access to the consumer goods group's vast global distribution network, the brand expanded fast, becoming one of Unilever's largest. Euromonitor projects it will bring in $2.2bn of sales this year, accounting for 2.6 per cent of the global ice-cream market — up from 1.4 per cent in 2013. </p> <p>“We held it up in business school as one of the great acquisitions,” says Mark Ritson, a former marketing professor who has taught at the London Business School and MIT's Sloan School of Management. </p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's Israeli presence long predates the sale to Unilever. When Jeff Furman, a board member for four decades, helped negotiate the company's 1987 licence with the Israeli entrepreneur Avi Zinger, he had no suspicion the deal would one day place the brand at the centre of a political storm.</p> <p>“I didn't have any real inkling or understanding of the struggles [of Palestinians] at the time,” Furman says. That changed when, in 2012, he visited Israel and the Palestinian territories. “I would describe this as a life-changing experience . . . what I saw there was just shocking to me,” Furman says. “I felt a strong responsibility as a Jewish person.”</p> <h1>Profit or purpose</h1> <p>As Ben &amp; Jerry's grew, the climate in business was also changing. The old orthodoxy, Milton Friedman's idea that “the social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits”, was going out of fashion — at least in theory.</p> <p>One of the loudest advocates of the new “purpose-driven” method of managing companies and brands was Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever from 2009 to 2019. Polman sought not only to ride the wave of corporate do-gooding, but to lead it. Setting ambitious green targets for Unilever, he argued that brands and companies with a clear purpose would ultimately fare better financially. The view ignited a fierce debate, but it chimed with broader trends. Environmental, social and governance investing was on the rise, expanding to become the fastest-growing segment of the asset management industry.</p> <p>After Polman quit Unilever in 2018, his successor, Jope, took up the cause in his turn. Jope set out plans to “dispose of brands that we feel are not able to stand for something more important than just making your hair shiny, your skin soft, your clothes whiter or your food tastier”. Yet in Donald Trump's America, with culture wars raging, companies that had adopted broad and sometimes vague notions of purpose found themselves the target of campaigns with a sharper edge.</p> <p>The Vermont campaign for Palestinians had joined the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which pushes companies to pull their business out of Israel and is despised by many US and Israeli politicians. The campaigners hit on Ben &amp; Jerry's as a target, says Faour, because of the brand's commitment to “racial and social justice”. </p> <p>By 2015, Ben &amp; Jerry's had decided to donate its licensing fees from Israel to organisations supporting Palestinians, says Furman, and began sourcing almonds from a Palestinian farmer co-operative, but held back from further action. “There was not a clear majority [of directors] that was fully committed, and given the blowback, you have to feel strong and united about going forward,” says Furman. </p> <p>People close to Ben &amp; Jerry's say the decision to quit the occupied West Bank was a gradual one, made after multiple trips to the Middle East. But by 2021 the pressure was rising. The march in Burlington came as a conflict raged between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that controls the hemmed-in, impoverished Gaza Strip. More than 250 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed. </p> <p>In July 2021, Ben &amp; Jerry's announced it would end sales in the occupied Palestinian territories. Anuradha Mittal, who had taken over from Furman as chair of the board of directors in 2018, told the Financial Times: “Our ice-cream was travelling on roads that the Palestinians cannot use. It was very clear that the presence of our product in the occupied Palestinian territory was inconsistent with our values.”</p> <p>The backlash was swift. Israel's ultranationalist then prime minister Naftali Bennett called Jope to accuse his subsidiary of a “clearly anti-Israel step” that would be met with a “strong” response. In the US, Mittal was the target of threats by critics, to the extent that she repeatedly moved her family out of her home address.</p> <p>Zinger, the Israeli licencee, argued that he could not have withdrawn the ice-cream from the settlements under an Israeli anti-discrimination law barring businesses from rejecting customers based on where they live. In March this year he launched legal action against Unilever, claiming the move not to renew his licence violated US laws governing trade boycotts and relations with Israel. Zinger called the planned pullout “misguided, unlawful and immoral”. </p> <p>In addition to the intense political pressure, Ben &amp; Jerry's move had begun to weigh on Unilever's already wilting share price. While the ice-cream brand sought to distance itself from the BDS movement, US state pension funds began divesting from the group, citing laws designed to combat BDS, many of which had been passed in recent years.</p> <p>The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which campaigns against anti-Semitism, took out newspaper ads in the US urging consumers to “tell your local grocery store to stop selling anti-Semitic ice cream!”</p> <h1>The rift</h1> <p>The battle comes at a tough time for Unilever. Shareholders unhappy about the group's lacklustre performance under Jope have not welcomed a bitter public rift with one of its star brands. In January this year, Terry Smith, whose investment firm Fundsmith is a leading investor, said the group had become “obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business”. The Ben &amp; Jerry's row was “the most obvious manifestation of this”, he added. </p> <p>The same month it was revealed that the American investor Nelson Peltz's activist Trian fund had taken a stake in Unilever. In May, Peltz joined the board. It was not his first encounter with the company. Peltz, who is chair of the board of governors of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, met Jope at the request of Jewish organisations and Israeli officials to lobby against Ben &amp; Jerry's planned withdrawal last year.</p> <p>Unilever moved to end Zinger's legal action in June. Giving Ben &amp; Jerry's board just four days' notice, according to its own legal papers, it announced it would sell the ice-cream brand's Israeli arm to a company run by Zinger, in a deal that completed two days after that. Zinger hailed victory, but the battle was not over. Days later the board of Ben &amp; Jerry's sued its parent company, seeking to block the sale.</p> <p>While Unilever claimed the transaction was outside the purview of Ben &amp; Jerry's independent board — as was the decision to bring the lawsuit — both sides used court papers to warn of the perils of a separate division that could follow a different path. Unilever argued that “if the state of Texas adopted a measure that conflicted with the board's views on LGBTQ rights, gun rights or the environment, the Board's position suggests it could force [Unilever's US arm] to end its decades of operations in Texas”.</p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's lawyer warned in a hearing that the Israeli licencee, who will hold rights to the brand in Hebrew and Arabic, could take it in unwelcome directions: “Instead of Peace Pops, he could make ‘Tank Pops',” Shahmeer Halepota said. </p> <p>In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz in July, Zinger was asked if, in future, he could rename Chunky Monkey flavour ice-cream to, for example, Ami and Tammi (Hansel and Gretel). He retorted: “Yes, but perhaps ‘Judea and Samaria' is preferable,” using the Israeli name for the area including the occupied Palestinian territory, the West Bank.</p> <p>In a sign of how bad-tempered the dispute has become, Ben &amp; Jerry's board has said Unilever has ceased paying directors' salaries. Unilever has not denied this claim, though a person briefed on the situation said it was not obliged by the acquisition agreement to pay the independent directors.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11427396.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>At the end of September, investors who were becoming increasingly critical of Jope were granted their wish for a fresh start when he announced he would retire at the end of 2023. His successor will have to chart a path between the imperatives of profit and purpose, analysts say — even as a darkening economic climate tests brands' ethical commitments. The direction of travel seems clear: Jope said in July there was plenty for the brand “to get their teeth into on their social justice mission without straying into geopolitics”.</p> <p>But Field argues that companies seeking to pursue an ethical approach may struggle to draw such limits. “It's very difficult to be ethical in just a narrow area of global issues,” he says. “If you're playing to the hearts of consumers who are concerned about the world, those concerns are unlikely to be confined to just one area . . . There is no point in saying that Ben &amp; Jerry's is just about the environment and sustainability.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the brand and its parent company remain at loggerheads. The dispute could yet harm Unilever's turnround attempt, argues Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, by damaging its ability to acquire start-ups, a key source of fresh ideas for consumer goods companies. “Unilever's ability to acquire creative, alternative, forward-thinking, on-the-edge companies is probably materially impacted by this,” Monteyne says. </p> <p>Other companies watching the spat will meanwhile be wary of allowing their own subsidiaries too much independence, he adds. If relations do not improve, Unilever could sell the brand, or even its entire ice-cream division, Monteyne says, though Jope has sought to quell such suggestions.</p> <p>Field argues that Unilever and Ben &amp; Jerry's need “some sort of compromise solution, a diplomatic way out”. But in the current political climate, other companies cannot rely on avoiding such an unwelcome spotlight: “Any brand that sets itself up to be ethical needs to be ahead of the game and work out how to handle the next big issue in the world.”</p><p>Source: Judith Evans in London 2022 'Ben &amp; Jerry's vs Unilever: how a star acquisition became a legal nightmare' FT.com 11 October.
