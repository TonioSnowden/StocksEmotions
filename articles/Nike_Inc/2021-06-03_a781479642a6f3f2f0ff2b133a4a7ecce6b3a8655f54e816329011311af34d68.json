  "title": "How Yoon Ahn ambushed the jewellery market",
  "text": "<p>Yoon Ahn, the Tokyo-based fashion and jewellery designer, has customised her Zoom background to show a cirrus‑kissed sky, the clouds aglow in sunset pink. Wearing a matte lip, thin gold wire-frame glasses and a black crew-neck T-shirt, the 44-year-old creative exudes the kind of cool you'd expect from someone who has fully tapped what makes the modern consumer tick.&#xa0;</p> <p>Korean-born and Seattle-raised, Ahn co-founded <a href=\"https://www.ambushdesign.com/en-gb/\">Ambush</a> in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95f72178-d712-41bc-be53-13588e30025c\">Tokyo</a> in 2008 with her husband, the Japanese rapper Verbal, as a costume-jewellery label. It quickly gained traction among the fashion crowd thanks to its wearable ease and slightly subversive, pop art aesthetic: the brand received early fame for a cartoonish necklace that spelled out “pow”, which was photographed on Kanye West. Today, Ambush is stocked in&#xa0;200 stores globally, from Selfridges in London to Neiman Marcus in the United States and Harvey Nichols in Dubai, and has had a host of sell-out collaborations. In&#xa0;2018, Ahn's friend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ea4c714-29b9-4a8f-96e4-f1cd0f7e1e8e\">Kim Jones</a>, the artistic&#xa0;director of Dior Men, asked her to&#xa0;translate her creative vision to the maison's jewellery department.</p> <p>Ambush runs the gamut from simple silver- and gold-plated pieces to novelties such as padlock bracelets (£755), a “pill case” pendant (£460) and mushroom trinkets affixed to safety pin earrings (£285). Charms also play an essential role. “It's a simple thing in theory – a charm bracelet – but it's something with which our customers have really connected,” Ahn explains from her studio. “There are roses, there are teddy bears. I think we offer a charm bracelet with a tiny bit more edge.” In 2015, she expanded into ready-to-wear, which has an&#xa0;urbane-meets-surf-inspired look and has been worn by Rihanna and Lady Gaga.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Yoon has this unmatched creativity that&#xa0;comes across in such compelling ways,” says another friend and fellow designer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eda5ecc8-b9a8-46bf-890d-afade078e720\">Virgil Abloh</a>, creative director of his own label, <a href=\"https://www.off---white.com/en-gb/\">Off-White</a>, and artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton. “Her design ethos is that of the next generation. She stays ahead of the&#xa0;current time, constantly anticipating what people are going to want&#xa0;instead of&#xa0;what they think they are looking for at&#xa0;this moment.”</p> <p>Ahn's passion for making jewellery started in Tokyo when, she says, she was “partying a lot”. But she had already taken an extra credit course in silversmithing when she was living in Seattle. “I was made to take a class one summer during high school,” she says. “And I was like, ‘Let me do something fun for once.'” She enrolled in a programme that offered jewellery-making at a local community college. “My first piece was a silver band ring,” she&#xa0;adds. “Nothing complicated. Jewellery 101, basically.” But it was the process – the&#xa0;wax‑mould sculpting, the modelling components – that had her hooked.</p> <p>At Dior Men, Ahn's hits have included rainbow crystal necklaces and bracelets, heavy chains and more padlocks – this time decorated with the French house's iconic font (and sitting within a slightly higher price range). “I just always liked the pop appeal of Ambush,” says Jones of why he asked her to work with him. “[Ahn] is very good at looking at the archives and is&#xa0;also business savvy. For me, it's just logical. Everything is so global these days, so why shouldn't an Englishman like me work with a Japan-based designer?”&#xa0;</p> <p>Ahn describes her working relationship with Jones as “seamless”, despite the exigencies of Covid-19. “I haven't been back to Paris since early 2020,” she says. “But even in this situation, Dior is very, very organised.” Ahn's current collection for the&#xa0;house includes a bedazzled Cuban link necklace (£1,900) and a calligraphic ring (£280) featuring artwork by <a href=\"https://kennyscharf.com/\">Kenny Scharf</a>, with whom Jones collaborated this season.</p> <p>As with so many modern brands, collaboration has been an essential factor in Ambush's rapid growth. One of the most successful was a sold-out run of <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/gb/launch/t/dunk-high-ambush-black\">Nike Dunks</a>, in which the brand's trademark swoosh was altered to create a pronounced spike. “I've been pretty lucky,” she says, “in the sense that all of our partners have come to us. I don't say yes to everybody – if given the chance, I hope that people we collaborate with are the best in their category. There's nothing above Nike, right? The reason I&#xa0;love doing them so much is because I&#xa0;want to see how different industries approach production, and how they work in terms of storytelling. I want to learn the most while working with the best. That's how I pick collaborators.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Other joint ventures have included redesigning Bulgari's Serpenti bag, making a sneaker-boot with Converse, creating glow-in-the-dark headphones with Beats by&#xa0;Dre, and releasing a limited-edition bottle&#xa0;of Moët &amp; Chandon champagne. Ambush&#xa0;is&#xa0;also poised to launch another collaboration with Nike, tied to the opening&#xa0;of the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics (Ahn is all for the event going ahead: “The city needs that energy, I think. We need something to celebrate, together.”)</p> <p>But the primary mission, as always, is&#xa0;Ambush's main business, which is the jewellery. Will Ahn venture into fine-jewellery territory? It would make sense, considering the visibility and the deep pockets of a good proportion of her label's fan base. “I&#xa0;am definitely interested in a high-end line,” she says. “But I still need to figure out what the right steps will be. I don't like to rush things. I think it's better to get really good at one thing, learn from it and then slowly build the next. I think we already have a really diverse mix of ideas in what we sell, and to go into the [fine] jewellery category, you really need a more singular message.”&#xa0;</p> <p>She continues: “What I want to do first is to go back to a more costume-focused, even outré sort of application to the jewellery we're already making. I also want to make it more feminine – most of my designs are not particularly feminine. But that's&#xa0;what I'm feeling these days.”</p><p>Source: Nick Remsen.
