  "text": "<p>Teaming up with Amazon has been a debate for many fashion brands. They gain access to one of the most popular shopping destinations, but cede customer information and give shoppers fewer reasons to visit their stores. Amazon charges fees to sellers on its platform.</p><p>Gap's CEO left the company earlier this year. It is being run by former Walmart Inc. executive Bob Martin, who is also the chairman, while the company searches for a replacement. The company has endured years of slumping sales at the flagship Gap brand and, more recently, problems at the Old Navy chain, which accounts for more than half of total revenue.</p><p>Amazon has tried to lure fashion brands to offer their products on its marketplace, with mixed success. Some brands, such as Levi's, Calvin Klein and Victoria's Secret, distribute their products through Amazon. Nike Inc. ended a partnership with Amazon in 2019 and has focused on selling through its own websites and apps.</p><p>Gap last year started selling home goods and furniture in a partnership with Walmart Inc.</p>",
