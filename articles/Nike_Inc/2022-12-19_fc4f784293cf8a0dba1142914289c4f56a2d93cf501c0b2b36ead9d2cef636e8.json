  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA finished down 162.92 points, or 0.5%, at 32,757.54.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX ended 34.70 points, or 0.9%, lower at 3,817.66.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 159.38 points, or 1.5%, closing at 10,546.03.</p><p>* Those were the lowest closes for all three indexes since Nov. 9, based on Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 logged a 2.1% weekly loss and ended at its lowest level since Nov. 9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a 1.7% weekly fall and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%.</p><p>What drove the market</p><p>Investors have become increasingly concerned about a recession many feel is all but inevitable given thedeterminedly hawkish stanceof major monetary authorities, such as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which continue to battle high inflation.</p><p>Read: The stock market is sliding because investors now fear recession more than inflation</p><p>Last week, alongside the Bank of England, the two central banks increased interest rates by 50 basis points to multiyear peaks and stressed that borrowing costs would likely go higher for longer than the market had hoped.</p><p>\"The Fed and ECB seem determined to leave a lump of coal in everyone's stockings this holiday season,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>\"With economic data undershooting expectations, it's not a stretch to think investors may shift their focus from inflation and the Fed to the growing impact that the Fed's actions are likely to have on the economy in 2023,\" Innes said. Analysts noted that investors had shifted from believing that bad news on the economy was good news for both bonds and equities — because it discouraged central banks from being too aggressive in their policy tightening — and were now taking bad economic news for what it is, a scenario that may damage company earnings.</p><p>The soft performance on Wall Street in previous sessions and worries about a global slowdown saw Asian stock markets fall back on Monday, with China's Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP finishing down by 1.9% amid more concerns about spiking COVID infections in the world's most populous nation. It may pay to take a long view on China as it relaxes its COVID curbs, which have been seen as a brake on consumption in the world's second-largest economy, George Young, portfolio manager with Villere &amp; Co., said in a phone interview. Villere &amp; Co. expects mining company Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, for example, to benefit from a renewed pickup in copper demand as China's economy eventually gets traction, Young said. Freeport looks set to see a down year in the near term, but is set for 40% earnings growth three years out, predicated on China's comeback, he said. In data released on Monday, the National Association of Home Builders' monthly confidence index fell two points to 31 in December. It's the 12th month in a row that the index has fallen. Outside of the pandemic, the December reading of 31 is the lowest level since mid-2012. Walt Disney Co. DIS, Nike Inc. NKE and Microsoft Corp. MSFT were the biggest decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* About 17.5 million Twitter votes were cast in favor of Elon Musk stepping downfrom leading the company, Musk's Twitter account said Monday, a day after he posed the question to users of the social media platform. Shares of Tesla Inc.   TSLA, the electric-car company he also heads, finished down 0.2%.</p><p>* The European Union accused Meta Platforms Inc. META of breaching antitrust rules by allegedly distorting competition in the markets for online classified ads. Meta shares ended 4.1% lower.</p><p>— Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>U.S. stocks close at lowest levels in more than a month as recession fears mount</p>",
