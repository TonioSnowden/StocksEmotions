  "title": "Maersk sees global supply chain woes for longer; lifts 2022 guidance",
  "text": "<p>\"Congestion in global supply chains leading to higher freight rates has continued longer than initially anticipated,\" Maersk said in a statement.</p><p>It now expects underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around $37 billion versus the $30 billion it forecast earlier. Maersk had initially expected full-year EBITDA at $24 billion.</p><p>The new guidance is based on a gradual normalisation in ocean container shipping in the fourth quarter of this year. Its previous guidance was based on that happening early in the second half of the year.</p><p>The Copenhagen-based company is often seen as a barometer for global trade as it transports goods for retailers and consumer companies such as Walmart , Nike and Unilever .</p><p>Electrolux , Europe's biggest home appliances maker, last month missed second-quarter profit expectations in part due to supply chain problems, but said the supply chain situation looked better for the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd last week also raised its earnings outlook for 2022.</p><p>Maersk , one of the world's biggest container shippers with a market share of around 17%, said in June that the cost of shipping goods was unlikely to abate anytime soon due to array of inflationary pressures.</p><p>Shares in Maersk were trading up 1.1% at 0825 GMT after touching their highest levels since early June.</p><p>Revenue in the second quarter stood at $21.7 billion, it said, above the $19.7 billion forecast by analysts in a poll gathered by the company.</p><p>Underlying EBITDA was $10.3 billion, compared to the $8.2 billion forecast by analysts.</p><p>\"The strong result is driven by the continuation of the exceptional market situation within ocean (container shipping),\" the company said.</p><p>Maersk is due to publish a full set of results for the second quarter on August 3.</p>",
