  "title": "Sports:  Track and Field Wants a Big U.S. Run  ----  By Rachel Bachman",
  "text": "<p>   Sebastian Coe stood back as the airplane returning from last summer's Tokyo Olympics arrived in Los Angeles, deferring to the decorated U.S. track and field athletes on his flight. </p><p>   Coe, president of the international track and field governing body World Athletics, expected that medal winners like hurdlers Rai Benjamin and Sydney McLaughlin would be greeted by a bank of TV cameras as they strolled into the airport. </p><p>   Instead, there was nothing. The heroes of the U.S. track team that won more than twice as many medals as any other nation in Tokyo walked through the terminal undisturbed. Coe, whose native Great Britain knighted him after a running career studded with four Olympic medals, called the scene \"bizarre.\" </p><p>   \"It's been one of, for me, one of the great anomalies, paradoxes,\" Coe said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. has been the \"powerhouse consistently of track and field\" and yet the world's best are largely uncelebrated in their home country -- the richest sports market in the world. </p><p>   That's why World Athletics has set an ambitious goal of making track and field one of the U.S.'s five most-followed sports by the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. </p><p>   This summer, the effort will get a squirt of lighter fluid. This weekend's U.S. track and field championships will be followed in July by the first-ever track and field world championships held on U.S. soil. Both events take place in Eugene, Ore., at Hayward Field. </p><p>   Track and field now ranks No. 8 among sports Americans are most interested in, according to a 2018-19 survey of more than 1,000 people ages 16-65 by Nielsen. The World Athletics-commissioned survey showed that 37% of respondents who were asked about attending events, viewing broadcasts or reading about a given sport, said they were interested or very interested in track and field. </p><p>   The sport trailed, in order, football (66%), baseball, basketball, soccer, swimming, tennis and motor sports. It edged out golf (34%). Ice hockey wasn't included in the survey because it doesn't typically overlap with outdoor track and field season, a World Athletics spokesperson said, although the Stanley Cup final has stretched deep into June this year. </p><p>   \"To get to the top five, the metrics, you know, are pretty clear to us,\" Coe said. \"It's about viewership. It's about attendance in stadiums. It's the engagement of fans. It's also the commercial revenue.\" </p><p>   Although Coe praised the history in Eugene, where former Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman tinkered to create early Nike models and wrote the book \"Jogging\" to introduce Americans to the concept, Coe said it's imperative to put meets elsewhere, too. </p><p>   \"If I'm being blunt, we've got to get into the L.A.s, the Chicagos, the Miamis,\" Coe said. </p><p></p>",
