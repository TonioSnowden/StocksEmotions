  "text": "<p>On May 22, it was Gucci's corporate bedfellow Balenciaga teaming with Adidas. Its runway show (a dense affair with gimp-masked models marching along the New York Stock Exchange floor) included a more conventionally athletic assortment of twin-logoed tracksuits and soccer jerseys. The collaboration demonstrates \"what we offer aesthetically to our audience. There is a fashion element to it, you know, [and] there is a street element,\" said the brand's mononym designer Demna in an interview backstage.</p><p>The collection went on sale immediately following the show with prices more in line with Bergdorf than Modell's: Trackpants at $1,550 and sneakers at $1,100.</p><p>The catwalk prominence of these partnerships -- that three-stripe logo sitting right above a fashion brand's name for look after look, item after item -- shows how the chasm between high style and mass apparel has all but closed entirely. (Price, of course, remains an exclusionary factor.)</p><p>Through a representative, Kering declined to comment on whether the two deals were coordinated at the corporate level. Adidas said premium collaborations are part of a new brand strategy announced last year. Brian Grevy, Adidas executive board member responsible for global brands, said in March 2021 that luxury designs \"inspired by Adidas and worn for status\" helped create brand heat.</p><p>Luxury sportswear collaborations are hardly new, but recent pair-ups embody a different attitude, said Thom Bettridge, head of creative and content at the online shopping site Ssense. The DNA of sportswear brands is more thoroughly intertwined with luxury production to create a full-spectrum of apparel and shoes -- the collaboration is \"becoming a tool rather than a big novelty,\" he said.</p><p>The same weekend as the New York Balenciaga show, Louis Vuitton hosted a Brooklyn exhibition of its collaboration with Nike, one of the final acts of Virgil Abloh, Vuitton's late men's creative director. Comprising 47 Nike Air Force 1s (manufactured by Louis Vuitton, not Nike), the lock-up melded Louis Vuitton's logo with perhaps the one brand mark more recognizable that its petite LV's: the Nike swoosh. The Air Force 1s start at $2,750.</p><p>Going back decades, Adidas has worked with Japanese avant-maestro Yohji Yamamoto, Stella McCartney and Raf Simons. \"What put Adidas on the map, collab-wise, was these really kind of foundational collaborations with independent creatives,\" said Mr. Bettridge.</p><p>The crumbling of formality and the recontextualization of sportswear as culturally dominant forced luxury labels to reconsider that separation. Yes, Jackie O. wore Balenciaga, but Missy Elliott, Pharrell, Liam Gallagher? They wore Adidas.</p><p>Two years ago, Dior released an Air Jordan collaboration that is still one of the most in-demand shoes on the sneaker resale market. A pair recently sold for $7,700 on resale platform StockX.</p>",
