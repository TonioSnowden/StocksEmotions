  "text": "<p>(WSJ Aug. 11, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>If the just-concluded Tokyo Olympics were memorable for the silence of empty competition venues, the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics are shaping up to be dominated by high-decibel politics.</p><p>The opening ceremony for Beijing 2022 is set for Feb. 4 in the same Bird's Nest stadium that the Chinese capital used for the 2008 Summer Games. The six-month gap marks the shortest ever turnaround between installments of the Olympics after Covid-19 forced Tokyo to delay a year.</p><p>Not much is known yet about how the Beijing organizers will deal with the pandemic-related issues that Tokyo labored with over the past few months. The Tokyo Games barred spectators and placed unprecedented restrictions on the movements of foreign visitors. With the Beijing Games fast approaching, Chinese organizers have said little about ticket sales, credentials for visitors or quarantine procedures.</p><p>Last month, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China was fully confident it could take up Tokyo's baton and promised to host \"a simple, safe and splendid Olympic gathering.\" After largely keeping Covid-19 under control with tight border controls and localized lockdowns, China is currently battling a series of outbreaks caused by the Delta strain.</p><p>Beijing 2022 will come close on the heels of a Tokyo Games in which China's Olympic team turned in a strong performance, winning 38 golds, just one behind the U.S. for the top spot.</p><p>Those results, however, were overshadowed in several instances by eruptions of nationalist sentiment both online and, in one instance, on the podium.</p><p>Chinese sharpshooter Yang Qian, winner of the first gold medal of the Tokyo Games, was excoriated by Chinese nationalists online over an old social-media post. In the post, she had displayed her collection of shoes from Nike, which has been pilloried in China after it pledged to stop sourcing cotton from China's remote Xinjiang region over forced labor concerns.</p><p>Chinese nationalists also attacked two badminton players from Taiwan, the democratically self-ruled island that Beijing claims as part of Chinese territory, but competes at the Games as \"Chinese Taipei\" under a special Olympic flag, after they beat a Chinese duo to win a first-ever gold in the event. One of the Taiwan players had published a Facebook post that said the victory was \"dedicated to my country, Taiwan.\"</p><p>Days later, two Chinese cyclists courted controversy by wearing pins that featured Chinese state founder Mao Zedong as they accepted gold medals in the track event, sparking an investigation by the International Olympic Committee into whether the pins violated a rule against political expression on the podium. Beijing told the IOC it wouldn't happen again, but stopped short of issuing an apology.</p><p>The Beijing Winter Games were already poised to hum with political tension as China, increasingly nationalistic under leader Xi Jinping, has clashed with the U.S. and other Western countries over issued including the Covid-19 pandemic and human rights. The highly charged atmosphere surrounding China's team in Tokyo has only heightened expectations of a politicized event.</p><p>If the 2008 Games were a coming-out party for a rising China, Beijing wants 2022 to be a showcase for what the ruling Communist Party believes to be its superior system of governance, said Steve Tsang, a political scientist at SOAS University of London.</p><p>\"Xi Jinping wants the rest of the world to admire the party,\" he said.</p><p>For months, human-rights groups have lobbied political leaders and companies to boycott the 2022 Games, citing the Chinese government's policies targeting local populations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan.</p><p>The U.S. government is debating an approach in which athletes could attend but dignitaries would stay away. The U.K. Parliament has signaled support for such a move.</p><p>The Beijing Olympic Committee didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>The IOC said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal that awarding the Games to any one Olympics committee \"does not mean that the IOC takes a position with regard to the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in its country.\"</p>",
