  "title": "World News: China Shuts Labor Auditor's Local Partner --- Move against U.S. firm amid allegations of forced work clouds bid to certify supply chains",
  "text": "<p>Though Verite was a small player in China's auditing industry, companies including Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc. have hired the Amherst, Mass., company to consult on labor issues at Chinese factories. The closure of its Shenzhen-based partner means that Verite has effectively lost its ability to operate in the Chinese market, depriving companies of a potential channel to conduct labor audits and research in China.</p><p>The nonprofit also had a reputation for investigations that lent credibility to corporations grappling with labor rights-related issues, other auditors said.</p><p>Disney declined to comment. Apple said the company had used Verite on a limited basis in China, but not to conduct audits.</p><p>China's actions against Verite come as Beijing pressures foreign businesses, rights groups and auditors in its effort to resist allegations of human-rights abuses in Xinjiang, where authorities have been accused by rights groups and Western researchers of forcing local ethnic minorities to work at factories around the country.</p><p>China has called the charge \"the lie of the century\" and says state-run labor programs that transfer Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority laborers are part of poverty-alleviation initiatives.</p><p>Spokespeople for China's Ministry of Public Security and Foreign Ministry referred questions to local authorities in Shenzhen, who didn't reply to questions. The Ministry of State Security didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>The move to close Shenzhen Verite has heightened fears of retribution in the social-compliance industry in China, especially for inspections tied to Xinjiang.</p><p>Shenzhen Verite's effective shutdown also risks further eroding the credibility of labor inspections in the world's second-largest economy, at a time when Washington is tightening requirements for companies to certify that their products are free of forced labor from Xinjiang.</p><p>In recent years, the Xinjiang government has constructed internment camps where former detainees have said they are subject to political indoctrination. China calls them vocational education centers aimed at deradicalization and counterterrorism.</p><p>Rights groups say that upon release, some detainees are sent to factories in the name of poverty alleviation, and that Xinjiang workers in state-run labor programs may face retaliation for speaking out against working conditions.</p><p>In July, the U.S. Senate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which, if signed into law, would expand on existing U.S. Customs restrictions on cotton, tomatoes and polysilicon from Xinjiang by banning all goods from the region unless importers prove their products aren't made with forced labor.</p><p>\"We can't let companies profit from forced labor,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), a co-sponsor of the bill, said. Mr. Cassidy said the proposed legislation could make China understand the importance of auditors like Verite. \"They're helping to hold China accountable.\"</p><p>Over the past year, auditors investigating forced-labor claims have become increasingly wary of provoking Chinese authorities, labor-rights groups and supply-chain compliance experts said. Last year, many Western auditing firms said they stopped investigating forced-labor claims entirely in Xinjiang because of government surveillance and lack of access to factories.</p><p>---</p><p>Article Triggered</p><p>Beijing's Inquiry</p><p>As online protests spread from H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB to other brands including Nike, the Global Times, a nationalist Communist Party-backed tabloid, published an article in March that blamed the U.S. nonprofit and other overseas groups for feeding into the \"Xinjiang forced labor narrative.\"</p><p>The article said Verite was hired to investigate Xinjiang forced-labor claims by the Better Cotton Initiative, a nonprofit that licenses sustainable cotton farms world-wide for Nike and other Western apparel brands.</p><p>The Better Cotton Initiative, which is based in Geneva and London, had also been attacked online for halting licensing farmers in Xinjiang last year over forced-labor concerns.</p><p>Citing unnamed sources and the head of Better Cotton Initiative's Shanghai office, the Global Times article said that the group hired Verite to support a predetermined conclusion about abuses in Xinjiang.</p><p>Verite, the article said, drew information from \"anti-China forces\" to allege human-rights abuses.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Better Cotton Initiative declined to comment. Verite declined to comment, including on whether it had been hired by the Better Cotton Initiative.</p><p>Chinese authorities took action shortly after Verite's brief mention in the Global Times' March article.</p><p>Supply-chain experts say China's closure of Shenzhen Verite is likely to discourage Chinese factories and auditors from cooperating with multinational brands seeking to comply with U.S. rules on forced labor, because of fear of possible retribution by the Chinese government.</p><p>Even before the nonprofit's issues came to light, some Chinese suppliers refused to disclose certain details about their workers, or to sign affidavits certifying that products weren't made with forced labor, lawyers advising multinationals on U.S. import controls said.</p><p>Third-party auditing \"underpins a variety of legislation\" designed to prevent American customers from being complicit in Xinjiang rights abuses, said Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.</p>",
