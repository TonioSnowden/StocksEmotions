  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  On Trend:  These Guys Love  Lululemon Pants  ----  By Jacob Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>   Men's fashion is jammed with culty fan bases. There's a cult of dogmatic Dunk fans, snatching up each new Nike release. A cult of Patagonia hoarders, swapping fleece jackets from the '90s. And, as I've learned repeatedly over the years, a cult of men who will tell you, in no uncertain terms, that Lululemon makes the greatest pants ever conceived. </p><p>   Yes, Lululemon, a 24-year-old, Vancouver-based activewear company best known for women's yoga pants -- and the controversial comments of the brand's founder Chip Wilson about some women who wear those leggings -- has garnered a near-religious following among men for its spartan, wouldn't-turn-heads, tech-fabric trousers. (Mr. Wilson stepped down as chief executive in 2005 and left Lululemon's board in 2015.) </p><p>   \"They look so professional, they look like regular pants but the fabric and everything is kind of more like sportswear,\" said Nick Looijmans, 35, a race-car driver who previously worked in the tech industry in Ottawa. He has been a Lululemon convert since a former colleague turned him onto the trousers years ago. \"When you put them on, it's just like the best pair of pants that you'll ever feel.\" </p><p>   Lululemon is widely credited (or if you're wistful for the days of tailoring and ties, blamed) with kick-starting the leggings-everywhere athleisure trend that spawned a zillion elastic-waisted trousers and stretch-fit shirts. From across the office, its two most popular men's pant styles -- the Commission pant introduced in 2017 and the ABC pant introduced in 2014 (both $128) -- look convincingly like dress pants, but are made from a pliable, could-do-calisthenics-in-them material. </p><p>   In 2021, men made up 25% of Lululemon's total revenue. While the brand doesn't break out revenue by category, according to Deb Hyun, Lululemon's SVP of global brand management and operations, the ABC and Commission pants for men comprise \"a pretty large share of our total purchases,\" particularly among new shoppers. </p><p>   Lulule-Men, she said, \"want products that really meet both their comfort and functionality as well as their style needs. And that's really the type of products that are doing well across our assortment.\" </p><p>   The Commission is cut like a familiar chino while the ABC echoes an elemental jean. (There are also other fit options for the ABC and Commission such as slim, cargo and a tapered jogger cut.) Both feature a \"Warpstreme\" stretch fabric that is billed as being quick-drying and wrinkle resistant. Flexibility is a key hook. </p><p>   \"I definitely had thought that like 'Oh like this is a woman's brand,' \" said Jon Lai, 36, a sales compensation analyst in Seattle, who came to Lululemon about five years ago and wears the pants almost daily. The Lulu-is-just-for-leggings reputation was ultimately easy to surmount: \"Once I tried the brand I was like, 'I don't really care what people think.' \" </p><p>   In recent years, the brand has aimed at men more directly. For a time, it collaborated with Robert Geller, a New York-based men's designer, on a slick product range that included a lemon yellow running jacket and two-toned shorts. (That partnership has ended.) Last month, it released a unise x hiking collection with drippy color-streaked shorts and a purple fleece vest, baiting the gorpcore crowd. And NBA player Jordan Clarkson appears in current ad campaigns. </p><p>   More than any marketing scheme or designer-led subbrand, word-of-mouth has helped the brand spread among men. Everyone I interviewed said they tried the brand's trousers after being recommended them by a friend or through an online search. \"If you typed in Reddit like 'comfortable pants for men,' I think the top posts would be Lululemon ABC,\" said Brandon Flora, 27, a restaurant manager in Chicago, who heeded that advice and now wears the pants religiously. </p><p>   Carlo Cavaluzzi, a 27-year-old photographer in Los Angeles, came to the pants via a peculiar corner of the internet: a Discord chat server for professional yo-yoers. \"If I was to post in that channel and say, 'Hey guys, what kind of pants should I get?' -- the answer is ABC Lululemon pants,\" said Mr. Cavaluzzi who has since worn his black ABC pants on \"hundreds of jobs.\" </p><p>   YouTube brims with videos of men reviewing the pants (often, positively) or comparing them to the multitude of similar tech-fabric trousers that have emerged from Instagram-marketed startups like Rhone and Cuts Clothing. </p><p>   Beyond comfort, Lululemon successfully identified that many men care more about looking merely presentable than being fashionable. Sold in earth-tone color schemes that bring to mind unobtrusive kitchen countertops, Lululemon's pants aren't supposed to be noticed, let alone remarked upon. </p><p>   Lululemon's designs have \"not a lot of zippers, not a lot of buttons, there's not that many different textures,\" said Mr. Looijmans of Ottawa approvingly. </p><p>   David Brunelle, 42, the vice president of web and mobile at Starbucks who lives in Twisp, Wash., noted that the pants have a \"universal nature\" and offer a \"low maintenance and kind of casual vibe that you can get away with wearing anywhere.\" For him, that's business meetings and dinners out alike. </p><p>   Over time, he has endorsed them to co-workers, converting them to the cult of Lululemon. </p><p>   Said Mr. Brunelle, \"Man, the people that have discovered them become pretty big fans quickly.\" </p><p></p>",
