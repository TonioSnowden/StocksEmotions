  "title": "Nike's Supply Crunch  Stunts Growth Again  ----  By Inti Pacheco",
  "text": "<p>   Global supply-chain constraints continue to hurt Nike Inc.'s sales. The sneaker maker reported for the second consecutive quarter that its growth was stunted by a slowdown of production and transportation of its goods around the world. </p><p>   Nike reported revenue of $11.4 billion for the quarter ended Nov. 30, up 1% from a year earlier. Analysts expected revenue of $11.2 billion. </p><p>   Demand for Nike's goods continues to outpace supply. For the previous quarter, Nike reported a 10-week delay in production due to a lockdown in Vietnam and said it expected flat revenue growth for the November quarter. </p><p>   On Monday, Nike said revenue in China, Asia Pacific and Latin America declined mainly because of low inventory levels resulting from Covid-19-related factory closures. Local mandates in China to reduce the spread of Covid-19 affected operations of a quarter of Nike's retail partners and half the factories that work with the company. </p><p>   The company said measures to stop the spread of the virus in China continue to drive volatility in retail traffic but that it saw traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter. </p><p>   Nike executives expect the inventory situation to improve. The company forecasts growth in the lower single digits for the third quarter due to the impact from lost production from pandemic-related disruptions in Vietnam. The lockdown in Vietnam caused Nike to cancel production of roughly 130 million units. </p><p>   \"Compared to ninety days ago, we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal 2023,\" finance chief Matthew Friend said on a conference call. Mr. Friend said that all factories in Vietnam were operational and production was at about 80% of what it was before the closures. </p><p>   More than half of Nike's footwear and about a third of its apparel manufacturing occur in Vietnam, where Covid-19 cases had the highest daily average last week. </p><p>   Nike's net income for the November quarter was $1.3 billion, up 7% from year earlier. Earnings per share were 83 cents, exceeding what analysts had projected. </p><p>   Direct sales rose 9% to $4.7 billion. Digital sales increased 12%. </p><p>   With the Omicron variant spreading quickly around the world, there is new uncertainty about whether port or factory closures could interfere with production or shipping schedules. Some countries are imposing restrictions to curb infections. </p><p></p>",
