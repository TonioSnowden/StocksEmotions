  "text": "<p>\"While I am disappointed that CAS did not reduce my sanction, I am pleased that the decision rejected USADA's efforts to impose a lifetime ban and assert numerous other violations of the WADA Code,\" Salazar said in a statement.</p><p>\"The decision reaffirmed that no Nike Oregon Project athlete was ever doped, that no competition was impacted by these technical violations, and that I generally took great care to ensure that any new techniques, methods and substances were lawful under the WADA Code.\"</p><p>Brown couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Even after his doping ban expires, Salazar could remain banned from coaching. In July the U.S. Center for SafeSport declared him permanently ineligible, alleging sexual and emotional misconduct.</p><p>SafeSport investigations are done behind closed doors, so it's difficult to know what led to the ruling. It followed public reports from female athletes that Salazar had pressured them to lose weight, sometimes with harmful health effects, and shamed them about their bodies.</p>",
