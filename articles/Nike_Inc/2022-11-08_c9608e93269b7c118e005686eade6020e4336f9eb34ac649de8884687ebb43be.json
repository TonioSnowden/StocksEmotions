  "title": "Adidas Appoints Puma Boss Bjørn Gulden as New CEO; New boss at sportswear giant comes to Adidas after successful run at crosstown rival Puma",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Gulden will take the helm at Adidas starting Jan. 1, the company said. Mr. Rorsted will step down Friday, with finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer slated to lead the company in the interim.</p><p>Mr. Gulden, a Norwegian national, is credited by analysts and investors with a successful run at Puma, where he mounted a turnaround by sharpening the focus on sports.</p><p>The new chief executive \"knows the industry extremely well and draws on a rich network in sport and retail,\" Adidas Chairman Thomas Rabe said.</p><p>Adidas stock soared more than 20% on Friday when the company first said it was in talks with Mr. Gulden. Shares were up another 2% on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Gulden, a former professional soccer player, will take over a company grappling with a number of issues around the globe.</p><p>One of his first tasks will be to tackle the sportswear company's issues in China, analysts say. Sales there suffered from a consumer boycott that began last year after the company raised concerns about forced-labor allegations in China's Xinjiang region. Chinese sportswear makers, meanwhile, have quickly increased their market share in recent years as their products improve in quality and design.</p><p>More recently, Adidas has warned of a large financial hit from its split with rapper and designer Kanye West, who goes by Ye. The company last month ended a partnership with Mr. West, saying some of his recent comments and actions had been \"unacceptable, hateful and dangerous.\" Adidas had a lucrative arrangement with the artist producing the popular Yeezy collection of sneakers. The company will hold an investor call Wednesday in which it plans to provide more details on the split with Mr. West and its future plans for the Yeezy line.</p><p>Analysts and investors see Mr. Gulden as being closer to the product than the more finance-minded Mr. Rorsted. Adidas said over the summer that Mr. Rorsted would be stepping down in 2023 after a number of challenging years marked by the economic consequences of the Covid-19-pandemic and geopolitical tension.</p><p>During Mr. Rorsted's tenure, Adidas advanced its digital transformation and grew online sales more than fivefold. But revenue growth lagged behind peers such as Nike Inc. and Puma in recent years.</p><p>\"Adidas is an extremely strong global brand,\" said David Herro, chief investment officer of international equities at Harris Associates, an investor in Adidas. \"We invested because the short-term challenges created a massive negative movement allowing us to buy quality at a low price.\"</p><p>Adidas and Puma have been rivals for generations. The two companies are based in the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach, where they were founded by brothers who fell out in the 1940s. For decades, people living south of the river sported the Adidas three-stripe logo, socialized with Adidas-wearing friends and shopped at butchers and bakeries where nobody in Puma gear would dare set foot. People living north of the river did the same, but with allegiance to Puma.</p><p>Mr. Gulden has already switched sides once, he previously worked at Adidas for seven years in the 1990s. He has also served as CEO of Danish jewelry brand Pandora A/S, managing director at shoe retailer Deichmann SE, and held various management positions at Norwegian clothing maker Helly Hansen.</p><p>Ingo Speich of Deka Investment, a major shareholder, said Mr. Gulden's combination of brand focus and capital markets expertise made him the right person for the job.</p><p>\"It's the right decision and they were able to move quicker than we might have thought,\" he said.</p><p>Despite Mr. Gulden's credentials, however, \"It will take time to bring back brand heat,\" said Mr. Speich. \"You can't turn around the business within a couple of months.\"</p><p>Joshua Kirby contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com</p><p>Adidas Appoints Puma Boss Bjørn Gulden as New CEO</p>",
