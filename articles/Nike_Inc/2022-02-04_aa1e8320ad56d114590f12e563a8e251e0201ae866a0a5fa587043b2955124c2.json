  "title": "World News: Beijing Olympics Marks China's New Power",
  "text": "<p>As host of the Winter Games, which open Friday, China is now a recognized superpower less interested in global validation and a lot less likely to get it. This time, nobody thinks the Olympics will change China.</p><p>Beijing is at odds with major trading partners over human rights. Multinational corporations that proudly aligned themselves with China in the previous Games are keeping a low profile.</p><p>The U.S. and its close allies aren't sending officials to the Games in protest of the authoritarian rule of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is expected this fall to extend his power indefinitely.</p><p>\"This is going to be the new-era Olympics,\" said Christopher Johnson, president of risk-advisory China Strategies Group, \"more triumphalist in design and tone.\" China's message, he said: \"We're here, get used to it.\"</p><p>The 2008 Games fostered excitement about interconnected people and economies. Interactions between China's Communist Party and U.S.-led democracies are now marked by suspicion. Both camps warn that fraying relations could lead to armed conflict.</p><p>Outcries dogged the 2008 Olympics over alleged atrocities, including in Tibet. Yet international guests appeared willing to give China the benefit of the doubt. Beijing took steps to address criticism, but there is little sign of flexibility this time.</p><p>The goal for China is \"to not just feel good about itself but to show power, prestige and dominance,\" said Simon Chadwick, a sports specialist at France's Emlyon Business School.</p><p>Sports opened doors for China in the early 1970s when a series of ping-pong matches between U.S. and Chinese players helped put the two nations on a path toward normal political relations. In the years since, sports has turned more into an ideological battlefield between China and the West.</p><p>In 2008, when organizers ran the Olympic torch through 135 cities in a four-month, six-continent relay, it proved a lightning rod for anti-China demonstrators. For the 2022 Games, the Olympic torch run was confined to Beijing.</p><p>When China won hosting duty for the 2008 Games, some proponents hoped the international attention would spur Beijing to liberalize its political system, similar to measures enacted in South Korea after Seoul hosted in 1988.</p><p>\"The Games are going to be a force for good,\" then-Olympic chief Jacques Rogge said in August 2007.</p><p>Many politicians and others in the U.S. and elsewhere found it unpalatable to cheer for a government blamed for restricting free speech, jailing dissidents and abusing ethnic minorities like Tibetans.</p><p>Yet more than 80 heads of state packed the VIP area of Beijing's Birds Nest stadium for the opening events, including President George W. Bush, the only U.S. president to attend an Olympic opening ceremony overseas.</p><p>The 2008 Games set the stage for China's increased leverage in world affairs, both by design and circumstance. The Games had barely concluded when the U.S. financial system stumbled, and Chinese spending slowed the global economic slide.</p><p>China's economy is now three times as large as in 2008. The country is the globe's top car market by sales, and it sets the pace for adoption of electric vehicles. China's outer-space objective in 2008 was to crash a probe into the moon. The 2022 Winter Games will be watched by three Chinese astronauts circling Earth.</p><p>Digitally savvy Chinese citizens live in ever-increasing comfort and reward themselves with domestic sportswear brands like Anta as much as Adidas and Nike, a sign of growing national pride.</p><p>China under Mr. Xi also has instilled broad crackdowns.</p><p>Human-rights lawyers in China who in 2008 faced sporadic harassment are today imprisoned by the dozens. A liberal clutch of online influencers who defied China's internet controls to highlight problems like pollution have gone silent. The security apparatus in regions populated by Uyghurs has under Mr. Xi spawned internment camps and forced labor; the government dismisses evidence of that as lies.</p><p>Hong Kong is now governed by a national-security law that sharply reduces the freedom of its residents. Taiwan in 2008 elected a president intent on improving relations with Beijing. Now, the island, which Beijing regards as its territory, gets buzzed almost daily by Chinese jet fighters.</p><p>The U.K., Canada, Australia and Japan also say they also won't send government officials to the Beijing Games.</p><p>Chinese authorities have brushed off the slights, trumpeting plans to attend by a growing list of foreign leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin. Beijing said it rejected politicizing sports.</p><p>Within hours of news in 2001 that Beijing would host the 2008 Games, Coca-Cola Co.'s marketing team began installing congratulatory banners on the streets near Tiananmen Square. The company rushed into production a commemorative golden Coke can, said an executive involved at the time.</p><p>As the 2008 Games drew closer, Coca-Cola underwrote the global torch relay and invited more than 1,000 guests to the opening ceremony, including then-Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, who ran with the Olympic torch.</p><p>Today, profits in China are harder to come by, and corporate executives worry about offending Beijing after seeing businesses censured, fined or boycotted.</p><p>Companies associated with the Games risk criticism from both Beijing and the West, said Howard Snyder, a Chinese-speaking, American corporate-risk consultant who has worked for sponsors participating in Chinese events, including the 2008 Olympics.</p><p>For the Winter Games, he said he advised companies to \"keep your head down.\"</p><p>Coca-Cola is sharing its sponsorship with a Chinese company and limiting its Olympic marketing to China. Chief Executive James Quincey won't be attending the Games, the company said.</p><p>China spent more than $40 billion to stage the Games in 2008, modernizing its ancient capital with one of the world's largest subway systems and a remade skyline.</p><p>One of the iconic buildings of the era is the trouser-shaped headquarters for China Central Television nicknamed \"Big Pants.\"</p><p>Since then, Mr. Xi has frowned on what he described as weird architecture.</p><p>China officially budgeted just $1.9 billion this time, saying in its bidding documents that \"Beijing 2022 will be an economical edition of the Olympic Games.\" The \"Water Cube\" for 2008 swim events has been converted for ice rinks.</p><p>For the 2008 opening ceremony, director Zhang Yimou introduced 5,000 years of Chinese culture with a show involving 20,000 performers.</p><p>This time, he wants to illustrate a \"community of shared future for mankind,\" a favorite phrase of Mr. Xi's. The show will feature the journey of a single snowflake, said an official involved.</p><p>\"China's status in the world, the image of the Chinese, and the rise of our national status, everything is totally different now,\" Mr. Zhang told state media.</p>",
