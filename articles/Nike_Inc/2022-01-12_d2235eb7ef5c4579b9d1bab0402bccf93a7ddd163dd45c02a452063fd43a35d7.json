  "title": "Record Omicron wave punches a hole in US workforces",
  "text": "<p>Businesses across the US are temporarily closing or adjusting working hours as the number of Americans infected with Covid-19 reaches an all-time high, underscoring how disruptions linked to the Omicron variant have rippled through the economy. </p> <p>Airlines, retailers, restaurants, hospitals and school districts are among those saying they are struggling to remain fully staffed because the current wave of infections has worsened an existing labour shortage by making many of their staff ill, or requiring them to stay at home to quarantine. </p> <p>More than 5m Americans — or 2 per cent of the nation's total workforce — could be isolating at home this week, according to an analysis by Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>“The Omicron variant is less lethal than previous strains but, even if it doesn't require the reintroduction of restrictions to mitigate the spread, the huge volume of new cases could still deal a significant hit to the economy over the next month or two, as millions of workers are forced to stay home,” he said.</p> <p>Business leaders have complained for months that workers were in short supply, especially in hourly roles that required in-person work. Many were already operating with fewer staff than usual. Then the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus emerged, driving a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a75a74a9-a017-4c5a-9cc9-fd9c76bac51f\">wave of infections</a> across the country and forcing some of those remaining workers to call in sick.</p> <p>Airlines were among the first to adjust their operations. They have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ea2809d-52fa-45bf-b855-e71a21906000\">cancelled</a> thousands of flights, starting over Christmas and continuing into the new year, because of the combined fallout of winter weather and flight crews testing positive.</p> <p>United Airlines said on Tuesday that 3,000 crew members tested positive for the virus, forcing it to cut more flights. “In one day alone at Newark, nearly one-third of our workforce called out sick,” chief executive Scott Kirby wrote in a note to employees.</p> <p>Many US airlines have been affected: United cancelled 9 per cent of flights between December 23 and January 8, Southwest cancelled 8 per cent, Delta 5 per cent and American 4 per cent.</p> <p>Among the US carriers, United, JetBlue Airways, Frontier, Alaska and Spirit cut their flight schedules for January the most, said Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth.</p> <p>United has agreed to give pilots up to three times their pay to work extra flights during January. Spirit doubled flight attendants' pay between December 28 and January 4.</p> <p>Staff shortages also forced retailers including Walmart and Nike to cut their hours of operation, while department store Macy's reduced operating hours on weekdays at all of its stores for the month of January.</p> <p>Starbucks too is adjusting operating hours, with some cafés in Manhattan closing at noon this week. “When a store is experiencing a temporary staff shortage, we respond by reducing hours to be mindful that our partners aren't overworked — prioritising their health and wellbeing in our decision-making,” Starbucks said in a statement.</p> <p>Joel Bines, co-head of AlixPartners' retail consulting practice, said several chains attending an industry conference this week had reported difficulty in staffing their stores since Omicron hit the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>“During the holiday season, even a handful of staff needing to stay home because of infection or exposure, that's enough to punch a pretty big hole in an already strained operating environment,” Bines said.</p> <p>Calvin McDonald, chief executive of Canadian athletic wear maker Lululemon, <a href=\"https://investor.lululemon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lululemon-athletica-inc-updates-revenue-and-earnings-0\">said</a> “more limited staff availability and reduced operating hours in certain locations” were partially to blame for lower than expected revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.</p> <p>Though retailers typically make fewer sales in January, and therefore require fewer staff, Bines said many were still struggling as they dealt with the labour-intensive process of handling unwanted gifts brought back to their stores.</p> <p>Suzanne Clark, chief executive of the&#xa0;US Chamber of Commerce, said on Tuesday that her members were also concerned about the impact that short-term staffing shortages&#xa0;would have in the longer term.</p> <p>“They worry about the impact on their brand if somebody tries a new service or a new product for the first time and the service isn't quite what they expected,” she said.</p> <p>The disruptions are not limited to the private sector — numerous school districts are struggling to find enough teachers. The Parkrose School District in Portland, Oregon, closed on Monday, citing staff shortages. It is due to reopen for remote learning on Wednesday and continue virtual education until January 21.</p> <p>“We are seeing a significant rise in the number of staff and students who are sick,” superintendent Michael Lopes Serrao wrote in a letter to parents on Monday. “This includes our staff that supports the operations of our district: nutrition, maintenance and transportation.”</p> <p>In Waterbury, Connecticut, some schools will only be open for half a day this week to help “relieve the district of the current staff shortage and transportation concerns affected by Covid-19” after being closed on Monday.</p> <p>Almost a quarter of American hospitals are also facing a “critical staffing shortage,” said the US Department of Health and Human Services, higher than at any time during the pandemic. New York's health department ordered 40 hospitals in the state to stop performing non-essential elective operations for two weeks because of the limited number of beds available.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/780cd193-89b8-435a-a2f1-b51944f1bf56\">shortened</a> its recommended isolation time for people who have Covid from 10 days to five last month, in hopes of relieving staffing shortages. But reports of business disruptions from the pandemic have continued. </p> <p>“Things are only likely to get worse in the near term,” Capital Economics' Hunter said.</p><p>Source: Taylor Nicole Rogers in Chattanooga, Claire Bushey in Chicago, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Obey Manayiti in New York 2022 'Record Omicron wave punches a hole in US workforces' FT.com 12 January.
