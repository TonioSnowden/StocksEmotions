  "text": "<p>The EU's top health official will be under the spotlight this afternoon after a torrid week for Brussels' vaccine strategy that raised questions about European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen's leadership style. </p> <p>Sandra Gallina, the commission's director-general for health policy, will be questioned by MEPs on the budget committee, 72 hours after Brussels was forced into an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c678dc02-c5f5-4717-a7ca-43c0ba3f2b44\">embarrassing U-turn</a> over proposed export restrictions that would have introduced checks on vaccines entering Northern Ireland from the EU.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/417e089b-31af-4950-949e-3ee1986f47ce\">The FT reports</a> on how the proposed “safeguard” measures for Northern Ireland were hastily pushed through by senior commission officials with little consultation with the executive's college. Mairead McGuinness, Ireland's commissioner, admitted that the provisions were done in a “rush” and that the “detail was not fully taken on board”. Officials told the FT the proposals were circulated to commissioners 30 minutes before they were due to be approved. One diplomat said the move to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty was like “bringing a hammer to a chess match”. </p> <p>Friday's fiasco topped off Ms von der Leyen's most testing week as commission chief. Brussels has been embroiled in a public spat with drugmaker AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies and risks a backlash from international trade partners including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c15d7ea-aaf6-46f4-924e-30f168dd14dd\">Japan and Canada</a> for forcing drugmakers to notify national authorities before shipping vaccines outside the bloc. </p> <p>Ms Gallina is expected to be quizzed by MEPs over the restrictions and a broader vaccine strategy that is struggling to meet demand. As the official in charge of negotiating contracts with drugmakers since last year, she has won plaudits for securing jabs at competitive prices. But with many EU regions having to halt vaccinations because of shortages, the strategy has prompted questions as to whether Brussels has wrongly prioritised cost over delivery.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, it is the commission president who will need to do the talking. Liberal MEP Sophie in t'Veld has demanded Ms von der Leyen explain the “procurement saga in a full and public session this week”. </p> <p>Ms von der Leyen faces a chorus of private criticism from officials and diplomats about how her centralised management was partly responsible for Friday's mishap. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1355942468001411072?s=19\">She has tried to</a> defuse the furore by announcing that AstraZeneca will up its deliveries by 9m in the first quarter, to a total of 40m — still far shy of initial hopes. </p> <p>MEPs may want the commission president to explain what happened, but they are not calling for her head. Ms von der Leyen's position is not under threat, as she retains the support of the powerful member states that got her the job (France and Germany). A coalition of MEPs that back her remain supportive. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonjhix/status/1355492927108231169\">Simon Hix has a good explanation</a> of why the nature of Ms von der Leyen's appointment is also the reason why her position is not in serious question.</p> <p>Accountability may not be forthcoming, but officials are holding out hope that last week's events may force a change of approach from Team von der Leyen. Her apparent reluctance to communicate beyond a narrow group of advisers has led to growing frustration during her 14 months in office. The vaccine fiasco might provide an overdue wake-up call. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: Fraught times for freight </h1> <p>European retailers are facing shortages of consumer goods such as home furnishings, bicycles and children's toys as the cost of shipping from Asia has soared in the last two months. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40d23da5-c321-4b56-8ec7-551573a7a485\">The FT breaks down</a> how a severe shortage of empty shipping containers in China is squeezing giants such as Nike and Adidas to Europe's dried fruit sellers.
