  "title": "Sports:  Oregon's $270 Million Track  ---  Nike co-founder Phil Knight gifted a storied stadium's  renovation to his alma mater. It was still controversial.  ----  By Rachel Bachman",
  "text": "<p>   Most college track and field stadiums are basic structures. The University of Arkansas's John McDonnell Field, one of the top outdoor track and field facilities in the nation, cost about $34 million including its 1998 construction and subsequent renovations. Even adjusting for inflation, McDonnell cost a fraction of what big schools routinely spend to renovate their football stadiums. </p><p>   Then there is the University of Oregon's Hayward Field, a 100-year-old facility that will soon reopen after receiving a stunning, amenity-rich renovation. The overhaul, really a reconstruction, features a stone base that refers to the state's Cascade mountain range and a curling, transparent overhang supported by timber beams meant to echo fir forests. It glistens with modern training facilities, a health clinic and even a barbershop. </p><p>   The official cost of the renovation: $270,047,937, according to an Oregon athletics financial report. </p><p>   Yet the university doesn't actually know precisely how much the project cost. Because of the privacy preferences of its lead donor and mastermind -- Nike co-founder and Oregon alumnus Phil Knight, the university's frequent benefactor -- that figure is an estimate prepared for the university by an appraiser. </p><p>   \"I never talk about how much on gifts,\" Knight said in an email response to questions from The Wall Street Journal. Although more than 50 other people gave to the Hayward Field project, Knight confirmed that he and his wife, Penny, were the biggest donors. The Knight family's wealth is estimated by Forbes at more than $50 billion. </p><p>   The new Hayward Field could hold a home meet as soon as next month if health conditions permit. It's set to host the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, postponed for a year because of the pandemic, in June, and the world track and field championships in 2022. </p><p>   Jimmy Stanton, UO athletics senior associate athletics director, communications, said the Hayward renovation \"exceeded its goals\" and \"sets the standard for track and field facilities both nationally and in the world for the next several decades.\" </p><p>   The scale and expense of Hayward's renovation was exceeded only by the fractious road it took to completion -- including impassioned protests from Oregon and Nike luminaries. </p><p>   Knight loves all things Oregon, and is believed to have donated more than $1 billion to the university, including $500 million in 2016 to launch a new science campus. Athletics, however, are at the heart of his life, and Hayward Field is his Rosebud. </p><p>   The 83-year-old Nike chairman emeritus still reveres the late Bill Bowerman, the championship coach who led Knight, a skinny miler for the Ducks in the late 1950s, and later co-founded Nike with him. It was Bowerman's experiments with the family waffle iron that inspired Nike's 1970s waffle trainer shoe. </p><p>   \"If there was no Bill Bowerman, there would have been no me,\" Knight has said. </p><p>   The reverence for Bowerman made the overhaul of Hayward Field particularly fraught. It had housed countless All-Americans, fostered the legend of fierce, floppy-haired runner Steve Prefontaine, hosted NCAA championships and six U.S. Olympic trials. </p><p>   Knight pushed for a modern, epic Hayward renovation, as he had with previous athletic buildings he funded at Oregon. The final product includes permanent seating for 12,650 with capability to hold nearly 25,000, according to the university, although Oregon track meets rarely filled the 10,500 capacity in the old Hayward. </p><p>   The renovated facility includes indoor warm-up and training areas, a weight room and lounge, a museum, classroom and lab space for the department of human physiology and a sports clinic. Giant murals of athletes splash across the stadium walls. The on-site barbershop bursts with Oregon-themed decor and a foosball table features twirling Duck-mascot figurines. </p><p>   Knight is far and away Oregon's biggest donor, but the exact amount he's given is unknown to the public. He usually steers his donated construction projects with a large degree of autonomy and deference from university officials, then donates the buildings to the school. </p><p>   \"Private donation records from donors are not disclosed,\" UO's Stanton said. He added that the figures listed for capital gifts of facilities in athletic-department records are \"third-party appraised values upon the facility's completion and gift to the University.\" </p><p>   Other Knight-donated buildings include an academic center for athletes opened in 2010 and that an appraiser estimated cost nearly $42 million. A Knight-funded 145,000-square-foot football complex that opened in 2013 was appraised at $95 million. One of Knight's few disclosed donations was $100 million to help finance Oregon's $227 million basketball arena, opened in 2011. </p><p>   Disagreements about what Bowerman would have wanted, in part, drove friction about the Hayward Field renovation. If in 1965 a donor had offered to expand Hayward Field and build world-class training facilities, Bowerman would have gladly accepted, Knight suggested to the Register-Guard newspaper of Eugene, Ore., in June 2018. </p><p>   Opponents disagreed that Bowerman would have embraced the stadium as it was rebuilt. Former Oregon runner, two-time Olympic marathoner and Bowerman biographer Kenny Moore saw the design as disloyal to one of Nike's guiding principles: \"Remember the man\" -- that is, Bowerman. </p><p>   \"When I cast my eyes over the planned transformation of Hayward Field, all I can see is a perversely ignorant 'remembering' of the man, the character and wishes of the man,\" Moore wrote in a 2018 letter to the Eugene City Council. Reached by email recently, Moore called his letter a \"loving warning\" and said that the \"stadium's current horseshoe shape seems to stiffen the hated north winds on the backstretch. I hope that is not true. No one despised them more than Bill Bowerman.\" </p><p>   Bowerman would have preserved the stadium's historic main seating area, Moore and others argued. The fight over that alone was so fierce that, Knight said in that 2018 interview, \"When those bulldozers in July knock that East Grandstand down, I am the most reviled man in Eugene.\" Nonetheless, down it went. </p><p>   The project even spurred a public disagreement between Knight and Tinker Hatfield, the famed Nike designer of many of the Air Jordan shoe models, who was involved with the Hayward Field project early on. </p><p>   Knight, in the recent email to the Journal, wrote, \"Tinker and I are fine.\" In an email to the Journal, Hatfield concurred. </p><p>   \"I disagree with aspects of the 'new' design but overall Phil and his team have built a beautiful, modern home not only for Oregon Track but the entire sport,\" Hatfield wrote. \"I certainly hope that the magic of the old Hayward Field finds it way back to the new venue.\" </p><p>   Knight made one adjustment at the behest of Bowerman's three sons, agreeing not to name a torch-shaped silver tower added to the stadium after Bowerman. The 10-story tower depicts Bowerman and four Oregon athletes. </p><p>   \"There was a strong group of track boosters who did not like the new design,\" Knight wrote in the email. \"Many of them have come around, and I would expect more to be on board when there is an actual track meet there. I am proud of the result.\" </p><p></p>",
