  "text": "<p>Knight is referring to the 2020 decriminalization of possession of small amounts of almost all hard drugs, including cocaine, in Oregon. Further galling the athletic-gear magnate: that, in 2019, Gov. Kate Brown signed a bill into law that prohibits restaurants from automatically handing out plastic straws unless requested.</p><p>Knight donated $3.75 million to kickstart former Democrat-turned-independent Betsy Johnson's gubernatorial campaign. She left the Democratic Party last year and has since led a centrist movement to draw support away from Democratic nominee Tina Kotek.</p><p>But as polling found support for Johnson waning, it allowed Oregon's Republican candidate, Christine Drazan, to shore up support for her campaign. The New York Times reported that Knight donated $1 million to Drazan this month after he told the outlet that the state government was leaning too far left.</p><p>Knight, Oregon's richest man, described himself as an \"anti-Tina\" person.</p><p>The Democrats have had a four-decade stronghold in Oregon, but the latest polls show that, as of Oct. 13, Drazan has a 3-point lead over Kotek, according to FiveThirtyEight. Drazen has 37.4% polling average, while Kotek has 34.3% and Johnson attracts 16.4% support.</p><p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight says he would do anything to take Oregon's governorship out of Democratic hands</p>",
