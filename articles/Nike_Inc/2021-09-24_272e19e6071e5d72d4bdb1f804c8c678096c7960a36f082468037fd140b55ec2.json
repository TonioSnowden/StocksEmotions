The German DAX DX:DAX fell 0.7%, the French CAC 40 FR:PX1 dropped 1% and the FTSE 100 UK:UKX slipped 0.4%.</p><p>Stocks also slipped in the U.S. as investors absorbed news from several central bank meetings this week, with the Federal Reserve and Bank of England taking a hawkish tone in the views of some analysts. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond BX:TMUBMUSD10Y continued climbing above 1.4% on Friday a day after seeing the biggest jump in months. German bund yields BX:TMBMKDE-10Y rose 3 basis points to negative 0.22%.</p><p>Investors continued to watch for updates from troubled real-estate company China Evergrande HK:6666, with no clear news as to whether the company made a $83.5 million interest payment on dollar bonds that was due Thursday. Bondholders reportedly don't have their money yet. The company has 30 days before it could trigger a default.</p><p>Economic data from Germany's IFO Institute revealed a third-straight monthly fall for the business climate index. “Problems in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate products are putting the brakes on the German economy. Manufacturing is experiencing a bottleneck recession,” said Clemens Fuest,president of the ifo Institute, in a press release.</p><p>That comes as the country faces an election this weekend that will decide who will replace Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p>“Finance minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) remains in pole position to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor after the election this Sunday, although Armin&#xa0;Laschet&#xa0;from Merkel's centre-right CDU/CSU has now narrowed the gap to almost within the margin of error. Surprises are possible,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, in a note to clients.</p><p>The French CAC saw the biggest losses as heavilyweighted luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton IT:LVMH fell 2% and German sportswear maker Adidas fell 2.8% on the heels of losses for U.S. rival Nike NKE whose shares tumbled after disappointing results late Thursday.</p><p>Daimler XE:DAI-owned Mercedes-Benz will become a new partner of a European battery venture — Automotive Cells Company — with Stellantis STLA and TotalEnergies FR:TTE, the companies said in a statement.

Analysts at Berenberg published a positive note on the company Thursday.</p><p>“We think that the decision by the U.S. this week to open its borders&#xa0;to vaccinated individuals is a positive step toward a more robust&#xa0;recovery in long-haul travel, which has lagged&#xa0;domestic&#xa0;travel&#xa0;markets. For Rolls-Royce, it will help&#xa0;to&#xa0;perpetuate positive trends in engine flying hours into H1 2022 and&#xa0;beyond, in our view,” said analysts Andrew Gollan and Ross Law.</p>",
