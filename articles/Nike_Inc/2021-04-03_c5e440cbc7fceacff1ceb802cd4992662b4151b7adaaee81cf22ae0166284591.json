For everyone else, let's go.&#xa0;</em></p> <h1>America's favourite sport goes international&#xa0;</h1> <p>The towering <strong>Olympiastadion Berlin</strong> has served as the backdrop for many iconic athletic feats. There were <strong>Jesse Owens</strong>' historic Olympic victories. <strong>Usain Bolt</strong>'s sprinting world records.&#xa0;</p> <p>And who could forget <strong>Zinedine Zidane</strong>'s infamous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAjWi663kXc\">headbutt</a> at the 2006 football <strong>World Cup</strong> final. Someday soon, the Olympiastadion could also witness a “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAp57G1hLn0\">butt-fumble</a>”.</p> <p>That's the tentative plan made by the <strong>National Football League</strong>, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12b7a706-cf5e-4623-997c-be0d04d68f27\">a resolution passed this week</a> by 32 franchise owners in the US league, who committed to expanding the number of regular season games it plays each season, both at home and abroad. Beginning as soon as 2022, the NFL wants to bring America's most popular sport to stadiums in Germany and Canada, and eventually beyond.</p> <p>Exact locations for future overseas NFL games are still to be determined, but a crucial part of the plan is that it expands international matches beyond the UK and Mexico, which currently host a few games each year. The new agreement also ensures that all 32 clubs participate in overseas trips, rather than relying on volunteers to play in them.</p> <p>More importantly, the expanded rotation dovetails with another resolution approved by club owners this week: allowing teams to bid for, and claim, foreign countries for inclusion in their so-called “home marketing areas”, or HMAs. These are geographic areas where NFL clubs have rights to sign local sponsorship deals, exclusive from other members of the league.&#xa0;</p> <p>Broadly, the NFL operates as one of the most powerful co-operatives in modern sport, sharing much of the revenue that flows to the league. As the most-watched programming in the US, the league negotiated an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0d7f203-568a-47bc-b068-076e22604802\">eye-popping new media rights package</a> last month worth more than $100bn over eleven years on behalf of its 32 owners, who split the proceeds.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the NFL, like other sports, has a demographic problem. To remain the most popular sport, it must attract and retain new viewers, including younger and more diverse crowds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bringing NFL games to new countries is one part of the plan. Expanding team HMAs is the other component: the league is inviting club owners to pitch marketing plans for virtually any international territory where the league is broadcasting, and have those areas included as part of their local sponsorship rights.</p> <p>That would give owners more power to engage with foreign fan bases directly. As <strong>Clark Hunt</strong>, chief executive of the <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong> told Scoreboard, the new resolution presents “a significant opportunity to connect with a budding section of Chiefs Kingdom in Germany.”</p> <p><em>Read more about the NFL's international expansion plans </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12b7a706-cf5e-4623-997c-be0d04d68f27\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>English Football League chooses debt over losing control</strong></p> <p>It's a dilemma facing leagues around the world. Desperate for finance because of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24e9fc43-4187-4884-8efe-7a6efb496f24\">how much control</a> should they cede for the cash they need?</p> <p><strong>Rick Parry</strong>, the chair of the <strong>English Football League</strong>, which runs the professional divisions below the top-tier <strong>Premier League</strong>, has answered emphatically.</p> <p>Parry agreed a deal US insurer <strong>MetLife</strong>. Under the agreement, Metlife's investment management arm, which manages $659bn in assets, will provide a £117.5m loan facility. The FT was first to report the news, which you can read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ced5284-d6dc-4e72-94ed-c24b2d9f4732\">here</a>.</p> <p>The group has provided sports debt for more than 15 years, financing teams, leagues and stadiums. MetLife is keen to lend to the EFL as it will earn interest at a higher rate than other potential investments, such as on government bond markets.</p> <p>“The case for sports financing ultimately hinges on the strong media value of the leagues, teams and organisations that we lend to,” said <strong>John Wills</strong>, global head of private placements at MetLife Investment Management.</p> <p>The debt deal is a relief for the EFL, which had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62d62daa-d45e-473d-94aa-4d4b1f663454\">previously agreed</a> to borrow £75m under an emergency coronavirus scheme devised by the UK government and the<strong> Bank of England</strong>. But Parry was forced to seek alternatives when the Treasury insisted that clubs would have to agree to restrain player salaries and bonuses as a condition of the financing.</p> <p>There was another option. Private equity suitors had made approaches seeking to buy a stake in the EFL, according to people briefed on the talks. But that would have come at a cost that some think is worse than paying interest: giving up a level of control over commercial decisions.</p> <p>In Italy, <strong>Serie A</strong> football clubs have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85191ee1-7b0c-4329-bc7a-b1c3338241e9\">bickering for months</a> about a proposal for <strong>CVC Capital Partners </strong>and <strong>Advent International </strong>to take a 10 per cent stake in a new entity holding the league's broadcast and commercial rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>Or take the case of <strong>New Zealand Rugby</strong>, the organisation which runs the All Blacks men's team, which has plans to sell a 15 per cent stake in its commercial operations to <strong>Silver Lake</strong>, the private equity firm.&#xa0;</p> <p>The players' organisation is seeking to block the deal. In a letter, <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/rugby-top-all-blacks-block-465-million-deal-in-explosive-letter-to-new-zealand-rugby/H4KLINPVHAESOYZQD7Y2LQ3XK4/\">obtained by the New Zealand Herald</a>, it argues the “special bond and the nature of what rugby means to New Zealanders, players and spectators alike, is at risk in the proposed transaction.”</p> <p>For now, Parry has avoided such difficulties.</p> <p>“The EFL has got lots of problems but at least it doesn't have someone badgering them into a position they don't want to take,” said one person with knowledge of the financing agreed with MetLife. “They have their independence.”</p> <h1>Extreme E: driving profits by going green</h1> <p>Setting up <strong>Extreme E</strong> during the pandemic was like racing with “a backpack of 100 kilos”, said <strong>Alejandro Agag</strong>. “Hopefully the backpack will fall away soon.”</p> <p>The founder of the new off-road rally driving championship contested in big electric cars has its inaugural “X Prix” in the Saudi Arabian desert this weekend. He has experience launching ambitious new motorsports competitions in difficult circumstances.</p> <p>Agag is the chair of <strong>Formula E</strong>, an electric car racing series, founded in 2014 but which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df864006-3e98-11e9-9499-290979c9807a\">nearly went bust soon after</a>. Despite that rocky start, it has survived as a platform for automakers to develop zero-emission vehicles and sponsors to burnish their green credentials.</p> <p>Extreme E is building on this concept by taking rally racing to spectacular locations that also highlight the threat of climate change. The Saudi Arabian race is meant to focus attention on the problem of “desertification” across the planet, while the series will also travel to Senegal, Greenland, the Brazilian Amazon and Argentina.</p> <p>Agag spoke to Scoreboard aboard a “floating paddock” that is shipping cars and equipment to the first race. The aim is to limit the sport's carbon footprint by avoiding the use of planes where possible.</p> <p>The series already has a sprinkling of stardust. <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, the seven-time <strong>Formula One </strong>champion, owns his own team, <strong>X44</strong>. Fellow owners include former F1 champions <strong>Nico Rosberg</strong> and <strong>Jenson Button</strong>, who will also be driving.&#xa0;</p> <p>Extreme E also requires teams to race with two drivers in the cars — a man and a woman — to tackle motorsport's miserable record on gender diversity. <strong>Catie Munnings</strong>, the rally driver, and <strong>Jamie Chadwick</strong>, champion of <strong>W Series</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/231afd44-cb0c-11e8-9fe5-24ad351828ab\">women drivers' racing series</a>, are participating.</p> <p>Extreme E's revenues should amount to €30-€40m this year, boosted by unexpectedly strong broadcasting appetite, according to Agag who thinks the series should be profitable next year. Broadcasters include <strong>Tencent </strong>in China, <strong>Disney</strong>'s <strong>ESPN </strong>in Africa and Latin America, <strong>ITV</strong>, <strong>Sky </strong>and <strong>BT Sport </strong>in the UK and <strong>Fox </strong>in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sponsors range from <strong>Continental</strong>, the tyre producer, and <strong>EY</strong>, the audit firm, to <strong>Neat Burger</strong>, a plant-based burger chain backed by Hamilton. Agag says sponsorship should pick up next year as companies plan their post-Covid marketing activities.</p> <p>It's a sport aiming to profit from a green, inclusive message. Just don't expect Extreme E to tackle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bc48b6-0c8c-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">other issues though</a>. </p> <p>“It's not my business really to talk about human rights in Saudi Arabia,” says Agag. “My business is to organise car races and we have one mission which is to take action with the climate.”</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Fenway Sports Group, </strong>the US ownership vehicle behind <strong>Liverpool FC </strong>and the <strong>Boston Red Sox, </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b17ded95-3d07-46d7-a7db-448de79b4b66\">an enterprise value of $7.35bn</a> following an investment by new minority shareholder <strong>RedBird Capital.</strong></p></li>  <li><p><strong>Endeavor</strong>, the Hollywood talent agency run by <strong>Ari Emanuel</strong>, has filed for an IPO, with <strong>Tesla</strong> boss <strong>Elon Musk</strong> named to the board.
