  "title": "The S&P 500 has to hold this line in the sand or risk a terrifying plunge, says strategist",
  "text": "<p>Many fingers are pointing in the direction of global central banks — we heard from plenty this week and notably the Federal Reserve. Rising bond yields can often mean trouble for tech stocks, and we may be seeing some of that this morning as Nasdaq-100 futures lead a shift into the red for stock futures.</p><p>Equities are coming off a pretty decent two-day rally as we make our way through the dreaded autumn period for stocks, and losses for major indexes stand at 1% plus for September. It probably doesn't help that we have additional China worries lurking as we wait to hear more on the Evergrande saga.</p><p>Our call of the day has a line in the sand for investors to watch. It comes from Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., who said a big move either way on the S&amp;P 500 SPX is hinging on one key level.</p><p>In a note to clients, Maley discusses how the S&amp;P 500 broke through its key 50-daily moving average (DMA) support level last week, but then regained it on Thursday. That DMA has been providing “excellent support” for the stock market throughout this year, he notes.</p><p>Miller Tabak Co./BloombergMarkets saw similar action in March, when the S&amp;P 500 fell below that 50-DMA for a brief period, then regained and continued to rise over the next few weeks and months, he said. &#xa0;“This is obviously a bullish development, but we want to make sure that it holds above that 50-DMA into next week. If it does, it will be quite bullish,” wrote Maley. &#xa0;</p><p>But watch out if the index rolls over and falls back below that key level.</p><p>Should that happen, Maley said he'll be “back to watching the 100-DMA like a hawk. Any meaningful break below that 100-DMA and its lows from Monday would scare the hell out of people. Therefore, that kind of move over the next few weeks would be very bearish,” he said.</p><p>Here's another take that says the S&amp;P 500 has some room to run higher:</p><p>https://twitter.com/MikeWShell/status/1441080149533937670&#xa0;</p><p>Read:Since 1983, here's the tipping point where bonds spell trouble for stocks</p><p>Ever waiting on Evergrande</p><p>Still no word on whether China Evergrande HK:3333 made a $83.5 million interest payment on dollar bonds that was due Thursday.
