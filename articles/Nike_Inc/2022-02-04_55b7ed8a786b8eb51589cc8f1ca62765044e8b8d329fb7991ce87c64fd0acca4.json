  "text": "<p>It is the second federal criminal conviction of Mr. Avenatti, the brash television lawyer whose ascent to stardom was tied to his quest to take down former President Donald Trump. In addition to representing Ms. Daniels in her legal battles against the former president, he publicly contemplated a 2020 presidential run.</p><p>His rise abruptly ended in 2019, when he was indicted in connection with what federal prosecutors said was an attempt to extort more than $20 million from Nike Inc. After a trial in 2020, Mr. Avenatti was convicted of three criminal counts and sentenced to 2 Â½ years in prison. He has appealed that conviction. Last year, in California, he represented himself in a second federal trial that ended in a mistrial.</p><p>In the latest case, Manhattan federal prosecutors accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing a portion of the advance for Ms. Daniels' memoir, \"Full Disclosure,\" then lying to his onetime client to cover it up. Prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti sent a fake letter from Ms. Daniels to her literary agent. The letter instructed that book payments be sent to an account controlled by Mr. Avenatti.</p><p>\"He was supposed to be her advocate, but the defendant betrayed her trust,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman said during closing arguments.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti portrayed the dispute as an argument over fees. \"According to the government, Michael Avenatti could never believe that he actually had a right to be paid,\" Mr. Avenatti told the jury. \"That is ludicrous.\"</p><p>Ms. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, served as prosecutors' star witness.</p><p>(More to come)</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Michael Avenatti Convicted of Wire Fraud, Identity Theft</p>",
