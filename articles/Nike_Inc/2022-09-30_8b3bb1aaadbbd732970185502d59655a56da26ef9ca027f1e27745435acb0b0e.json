  "title": "How to Sell a 'Stranger Things' House? Add a Demogorgon; The Upside Down was ever present as real-estate agent played up ties between show and this three-bedroom, 1,850-square-foot home in Fayetteville, Ga.",
  "text": "<p>He featured the show heavily in the listing, even asking a photographer to add a reddish-hue so it looks like it is in the Upside Down, the scary alternate dimension in the show. A Demogorgon was photoshopped into the living room. For another photo, Mr. Smith hung Christmas lights and painted the alphabet in black paint on the wall, re-creating a critical scene where the character Joyce Byers, played by actress Winona Ryder, communicates with her missing son who is stuck in the Upside Down.</p><p>A day after the listing went up, gossip site TMZ wrote about it. \"My phone just started blowing up,\" Mr. Smith said, with requests to see the property. Multiple offers came in, he said, and one was accepted this week. It is expected to close next month.</p><p>The house, built more than 120 years ago, has been passed down through one family for a century, Mr. Smith said. It is currently owned by seven siblings who didn't want to speak to the media or be named, the agent said. The owners are distantly related to Mr. Smith's wife, he said.</p><p>\"Stranger Things\" producers first approached the home's owners in 2015 about using the building's exterior as a setting in the show.</p><p>\"They said they were looking for a house that looked like it was in 'The Goonies' but with aliens,\" Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Netflix didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The wood-paneled walls and dated wallpaper won them over, Mr. Smith said, giving them the 1970s and 1980s vibe they were looking for. The show, which takes place in the 1980s, is set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Ind., and the house serves as the residence of the main characters, the Byers family. It is featured heavily in the first season. Producers filmed outside and at sets in Georgia, Mr. Smith said.</p><p>\"Stranger Things,\" which premiered in 2016, was a breakout hit for Netflix and has led to numerous merchandise tie-ins, including Nike Inc. sneakers and limited-edition cans of Coca-Cola Co.</p><p>Fans frequently visit the house, Mr. Smith said.</p><p>\"Some people even were trying to open the door because they didn't realize people live there,\" he said.</p><p>The driveway had to be blocked, and a no trespassing sign was put outside.</p><p>Mr. Smith, a real-estate agent with eXp Realty and longtime fan of \"Stranger Things,\" knows of other famous homes rented to fans, including the white-columned house from the 1990s sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and a home from the \"Twilight\" vampire film series. Another \"Stranger Things\" house, which the Byers moved into in later seasons, typically rents for $400 a night on Airbnb.</p><p>Ryan Asher, the owner of that house in Albuquerque, N.M., said he didn't know it was a \"Stranger Things\" house when he first saw it last year, but it was disclosed to him after he expressed interest in buying it. He bought the five-bedroom house for more than $500,000 in December and hasn't moved in. It is booked until November on Airbnb, Mr. Asher said, and then booked throughout the holidays—which more than pays for the monthly mortgage.</p><p>Fans who rent the house like to recreate scenes from \"Stranger Things\" to post on TikTok, Mr. Asher said. A renter once wore a Demogorgon mask and sat by a window, he said, startling fans who were visiting the home.</p><p>He thinks he will move into the house eventually—if the excitement around the show dies down.</p><p>\"I would be thrilled if it never ended,\" he said.</p><p>Producers have said the next season will be the show's last.</p><p>Mr. Asher said he made few changes to the house, except he tried to match curtains and decorations seen in the show.</p><p>The house in Fayetteville, however, was listed as a fixer-upper and needs renovations, Mr. Smith said. \"It's just old,\" he said. But, he added, someone could potentially just move in if they wanted to. \"You're not going to fall through the floor.\"</p><p>The winning bidder plans to renovate it and make the interiors look more like it did on the show, said Katie Siplon, a real-estate agent who represented the buyers.</p><p>Ms. Siplon declined to name the buyers, but said they are married real-estate investors from Portland, Ore. She showed them the house on a video call.</p><p>The house will be up on Airbnb before the end of the year, said Ms. Siplon, who works for TriCounty Real Estate in Savannah, Ga.</p><p>There were 25 other offers for the house, she said. The winning bid? About $600,000, or nearly double the asking price, Ms. Siplon said.</p><p>\"It was a very tough fight for this one,\" she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you purchase a home that has been used in the filming of a TV show?
