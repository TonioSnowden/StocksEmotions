  "text": "<p>At the time, Democrats like New York's Sen. Chuck Schumer, whose state is home to baseball's headquarters, were shamefully calling the new Georgia law \"racist voter suppression\" and suggesting the Empire State was more voter-friendly. Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp responded:</p><p>New York has nine days of early voting. Georgia has a minimum of 17, with an additional two Sundays as an option for every county.</p><p>New York requires an excuse to vote absentee. Georgia does not.</p><p>They're lying and they know it.</p><p>One of the principal alleged offenses of the new Georgia voting law was to require people to present valid identification, which of course is exactly what Major League Baseball did when considering volunteers for its relocated All-Star Game in Denver.</p><p>When Mr. Manfred capitulated to the woke mob back in April and agreed to move the game, he called it \"the best way to demonstrate our values.\" New reporting suggests his gesture was just as empty and self-serving as it appeared at the time. This week the Journal's Jared Diamond and Louise Radnofsky write:</p><p>To Manfred, relocating the All-Star Game had nothing to do with the Braves or the people of Georgia but was rather a move to stave off further controversy, people familiar with the matter said. MLB worried about the possibility of players boycotting the gameâ€”or having to answer questions about their status for months leading up to it. Ultimately, MLB knew that no matter what it did with the All-Star Game, people would be angry. Manfred determined moving it to Denver was the better option.</p><p>Not a moral imperative, but simply the better option to address a public-relations headache?</p><p>Perhaps Mr. Manfred eventually realized the headaches to come if he continued his major league virtue signalling. In April Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) helped him to consider the implications with a letter noting the unpleasant possibilities:</p><p>Dear Commissioner Manfred:</p><p>I write to ask you whether you intend to maintain your membership at Augusta National Golf Club. As you are well aware, the exclusive members-only club is located in the State of Georgia...</p><p>Will Major League Baseball now end its engagement with nations that do not hold elections at all like China and Cuba? Will you end your lucrative financial relationship with Tencent, a company with deep ties to the Communist Party...?</p><p>Confronting China's communist dictatorship really is an act of virtue. Demanding it from woke CEOs may not always yield an immediate result, but it may at least inspire them to stop mouthing condemnations of America's free society.</p><p>This brings us to the other hopeful news of the week, covered among other places by Nike's local newspaper. Aron Yohannes of The Oregonian reports:</p><p>Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter called out Nike and its co-founder, Phil Knight, in a post on social media this week.</p><p>In various posts, Kanter has been calling attention to injustices in China. Kanter on Instagram invited Knight to take a trip with him to China to visit Nike facilities, which he described as \"slave labor camps.\" He tagged LeBron James as well as Jordan Brand in the caption and added \"you guys are welcome to come too.\"</p><p>Mr. Kanter has noticed that, like baseball's Mr. Manfred, Nike and Mr. James embrace a double standard when it comes to criticizing the U.S. and avoiding criticism of the communist dictatorship that presides over China's massive consumer market. The Oregonian report adds:</p><p>\"Nike remains vocal about injustice here in America, but when it comes to China, Nike remains silent,\" Kanter said. \"You do not address police brutality in China, you do not speak about discrimination against the LGBTQ community, you do not say a word about the oppression of minorities in China, you are scared to speak up. Who makes the shoes in China? Do you even know? There are so many forced labor factories in China.\"</p><p>Kanter captioned the post with the hashtags #HypocriteNike and #EndUyghurForcedLabor.</p><p>\"Nike has not publicly commented on Kanter's posts,\" adds the Oregonian report.</p><p>Maybe if fans are lucky the company won't comment on U.S. politics either.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>***</p><p>Pro Sports without Woke Politics</p>",
