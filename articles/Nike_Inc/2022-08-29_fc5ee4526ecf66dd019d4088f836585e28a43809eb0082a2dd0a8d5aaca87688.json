  "title": "Critics Say Metaverse Could Use a Makeover",
  "text": "<p>By the time Mr. Zuckerberg shared an updated photo three days later (\"the graphics in Horizon are capable of much more,\" he wrote), the damage was done. How, a chorus of critics wondered, could a multibillion-dollar metaverse possibly look like this? And would it always?</p><p>Lifestyle brands and investors pumping cash into Web3 projects say these questions miss the point: The metaverse is the next phase of the internet, they insist, and it is still evolving. Plus, Meta's version is just one take. (A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, saying the company would reveal more details about Horizon in the fall.)</p><p>Ethan Zuckerman, a University of Massachusetts Amherst professor and internet scholar, said the stripped-down appearance of Horizon Worlds could be by design. (When asked to speak about Horizon, a Meta representative directed a reporter to Mr. Zuckerberg's updated metaverse photo.)</p><p>\"If I'm Zuckerberg, and I'm trying to get to a billion users, I'm saying, 'It's got to be simple.' They're trading visual appeal for the ability to create,\" Mr. Zuckerman said, adding that Minecraft and Roblox, two popular games users are interacting with regularly, are hardly visually sumptuous. \"It's hard to make tools that are both easy to use and look terrific.\" To do so, he said, requires more animation capabilities than current digital worlds support.</p><p>Akash Nigam, the chief executive of digital avatar company Genies, noted that photorealism is rarely the goal in such environments. \"The whole point of an avatar is the emotion, and the inner personality you can't represent in a human form,\" he said. \"It's why our most popular options aren't even human forms -- they're species.\"</p><p>Billionaire investor and \"Shark Tank\" star Mark Cuban noted that the term \"metaverse\" can refer to very different types of projects, such as digital products (\"a great business\") and metaverse real estate (in his opinion, \"DAF,\" rude initials for dumb).</p><p>\"The issue is that the metaverse isn't singular. Almost anything can be defined as a metaverse,\" Mr. Cuban wrote in an email. \"There is an unlimited number of possibilities. The variety will make it difficult to build standards.\"</p><p>Some projects showcase more visual handiwork and attention to detail. But when digital clothes and NFTs are transferred into virtual worlds, they must be formatted to fit into the game's artistic language. Some lose design elements in the process.</p><p>\"NFTs get a lot of attention for being super high-priced collector items, and so far there's no high-end world to display them in,\" said Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of Rtfkt, a virtual-asset company that sells $500 sneakers and $10,000 avatars; it was acquired by Nike last year. But the lack of elite gallery space hasn't dissuaded Rtfkt's clientele, he said, who seem happy enough to display their items in digital spaces they love.</p><p>Tommy Hilfiger, which has created branded experiences in Roblox and Decentraland, believes virtual worlds could present a path to building relationships with Gen Z customers. Roblox players have bought or won about 10.3 million Tommy Hilfiger products in the game, and the company plans to stream its coming New York Fashion Week presentation in Roblox, too.</p><p>\"We're not of the mind-set that we should steer clear of exploring in the metaverse due to some of the limitations,\" said Avery Baker, the company's president and chief brand officer.</p><p>In September, Puma will introduce a digital hub for buying virtual sneakers, which can later be redeemed for real sneakers. The company sees it as a new way to engage with customers.</p><p>\"Is it going to be better than the best games out there?\" said Puma chief brand officer Adam Petrick. \"No, it's not. But it's not meant to be.\"</p>",
