  "text": "<p>Below is a screen of all sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index SPX, then narrower stock screens within the “winning” sector by sales projections.</p><p>So far this year, investors have been jittery because of the Federal Reserve's policy reversal, to fighting inflation by raising interest rates rather than doing anything it could to spur economic growth during the pandemic.</p><p>In a strategy report for clients on Jan. 17, analysts at BCA Research wrote: “We subscribe to the view that expansions are more likely to be murdered by the Fed than die of old age. It's hard to envision a plausible scenario in which the Fed could hike rates enough in 2022 to kill this one, though, and even the first half of 2023 would be a reach.”</p><p>We have already seen that the prospect of rising interest rates has pressured stocks that have higher valuations to earnings. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, which is heavily weighted toward technology stocks, just suffered its first correction (a decline of 10% of more) since March.</p><p>Getting back to the BCA comment, the U.S. economy is so large that it isn't easily cooled-down by the Fed. Investors who flee the stock market in an effort to time their return after rising interest rates have their effect, risk returning too late and missing significant growth in the meantime.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 sector projections</p><p>The following projections are based on consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet, weighted by market capitalization. (The S&amp;P 500 is cap-weighted.) The projections are broken into three tables showing expected changes in sales per share, earnings per share and dividends paid per share.

HD for a five-year example. If you had purchased the stock at the close on Jan. 19, 2017, you would have paid $135.39 a share. At that time, the annual dividend rate was $2.76 a share, for a yield of 2.04%. If you had held the shares through Jan. 19, 2022, your annual dividend would have increased to $6.60 a share, for a yield of 4.87% for your five-year-old shares. Meanwhile, your share price would have increased by 166% to $359.69. In this example, dividends weren't reinvested. If they were, the five-year return on Home Depot shares would have been 198%.</p><p>You can read more about dividend compounders here.</p><p>Analysts' price targets</p><p>While the two screens above focus on estimates through 2023, ratings and price targets set by analysts who work for brokerage firms are based on 12-month outlooks.</p><p>Among the 60 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary sector, there are 20 with majority “buy” or equivalent ratings, for which the analysts see more than 20% upside over the next year, and only two (the top two) are in the hotel, cruise line, casino or travel services industries:</p><p> Company                      Ticker  Industry                 Share “buy” ratings  Closing price – Jan. 19  Consensus price target  Implied 12-month upside potential  Penn National Gaming Inc.
