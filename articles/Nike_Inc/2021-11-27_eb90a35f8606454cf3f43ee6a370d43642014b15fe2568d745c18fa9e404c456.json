  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: Puffed-Up Coats, Inflated Prices --- What would it take for you to buy a $4,000 puffer coat when perfectly cozy ones sell for $80? Some people are splurging and -- hint -- warmth is not the reason.",
  "text": "<p>Breathtaking price tags notwithstanding, it seems that some folks are buying these investment puffers. On my recent visit to Galeries Lafayette, the chichi shopping institution in the heart of Paris, racks carrying clothes by luxury stalwarts like Loewe, Celine and Brunello Cucinelli stood largely ignored, while shoppers bustled about the Moncler coat section with its four-figure puffers. At Bloomingdale's, pricey puffers such as Stone Island's $1,073 crinkly electric-blue nylon jacket have been \"performing really well,\" according to Justin Berkowitz, the store's men's fashion director. Egalitarian trail-mix types -- or anyone lacking a second home in Aspen -- might find such elitist outerwear laughable. Uniqlo's $80 puffers remain a perennial winter favorite, and many brands from Gap to Muji to Urban Outfitters offer a serviceable sub-$125 down coat. So why would anyone shell out $2,550 for a Fendi puffer? Won't Patagonia's $229 version keep you warm enough?</p><p>Counterintuitive as it sounds, relative warmth isn't the prime reason to splurge on a puffer now; it's about the nuances of style. As Mr. Berkowitz said, when Bloomingdale's decides what down jackets to stock, \"we all are basically working from the assumption that yes, it will keep you warm.\" Instead, he and his team scrutinize \"styling elements\" like the fabric's shine (Moncler's shimmering $1,500-ish high-gloss coats are a current top seller), or how the zippers look, or if it's too short to cover a blazer. He noted that people are \"really embracing the idea of individuality,\" whether through a pair of lurid Nike sneakers, or a sherbet C.P. Company puffer that no one else on their block thought to spend $798 on.</p><p>Jordan Aylwin, 23, a retail employee in Toronto, embodies the fashion-first mentality. Last winter, he wore a slimming $450 puffer by the gorpy Canadian label Arc'teryx. \"It's super sleek. It's very minimal,\" he said. He did concede that, in particularly extreme Canadian weather, \"it isn't the warmest jacket.\" This season, he's considering a paunchier and toastier North Face puffer.</p><p>More commonly, shoppers I spoke with tried to find a balance between proper insulation and aesthetics. David Gibson, 30, a product manager at New Balance in Boston, has worn a thick $379 Arc'teryx puffer for two winters now. The quilted coat suffices for New England winters, but even more important, it came in a sprightly clementine color that complements Mr. Gibson's otherwise neutral-toned outfits. Said Mr. Gibson, \"I wear it loud and proud.\"</p><p>Mr. Gibson's coat is downright tame compared to Juliet Bader's puffer du jour: an ERL jacket gridded in wavy yellow, green and blue shapes. Based in Los Angeles, ERL introduced prominent puffers patterned with rising sun motifs and lava-lamp bubbles in 2020. They've since been worn by Justin Bieber and the rapper 21 Savage and sold alongside Loro Piana suits and Charvet ties at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. Ms. Bader, a 25-year-old New Yorker, said her jacket is so vibrant she \"can't walk three blocks without a comment\" on it. She bought the $818 coat on a resale site at a discount, yet even at $550-ish, it represented an investment for the recent college grad. But on those bleak winter days when the sky is the color of wet newsprint, she considers it money well spent. \"I feel happy when I put [this] really colorful jacket on.\"</p>",
