The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.</p><p>Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust.

He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, ethereum ETHUSD and dogecoin DOGEUSD, according to a CNBC report, and also says that80% of his investments that aren't on \"Shark Tank\" are crypto-related.</p><p>But what's next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, wasdown more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.</p><p>\"I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn't necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,\" Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.</p><p>See also: Nike accuses StockX of selling fake shoes after reps bought counterfeit sneakers on the site</p><p>Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, Twitter, Uber UBER, Snap SNAP and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, Google GOOG and Amazon AMZN were all there,\" Vaynerchuk said.</p><p>See also: Who is the richest person in the world?

EXACTLY,\" he wrote. \"I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won't.\"</p><p>Cuban's latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting.
