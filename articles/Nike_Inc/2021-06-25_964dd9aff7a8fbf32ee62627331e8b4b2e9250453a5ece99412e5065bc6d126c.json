  "title": "Business News:  Nike Swings to Profit, Posts  Record Revenue in Quarter  ----  By Kimberly Chin",
  "text": "<p>   Nike Inc. posted record quarterly sales, topping $12 billion for the first time in its 50-year history, on pent-up U.S. consumer demand for sneakers and sportswear this spring. </p><p>   Revenue in the May ended quarter nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from $6.31 billion a year ago, when sales were depressed by the spread of Covid-19. Nike's direct sales -- those items ordered through its apps, websites or own stores -- climbed 73% to $4.5 billion. </p><p>   Shares jumped 12% in after-hours trading, as the sales and profits were better than Wall Street had forecast. Nike's net income was $1.5 billion, compared with a net loss of $790 million in the year-ago quarter. </p><p>   \"These are times when strong brands can get stronger, and each quarter, this reality becomes even more clear,\" said CEO John Donahoe on a call Thursday with analysts. </p><p>   During the pandemic, many professional and youth sports were halted. Nike temporarily closed its retail stores and continued to pay its workers, and doubled down on digital sales. </p><p>   Revenue increased 141% in North America in the quarter ended May. </p><p></p>",
