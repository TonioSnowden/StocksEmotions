  "title": "Can Adidas Be Luxury? Balenciaga and Gucci Say Yes; The athletic giant was a surprising guest star on spring runways, offering luxe versions of its sportswear that included fur and tweed",
  "text": "<p>This past Sunday, it was Gucci's corporate bedfellow Balenciaga teaming with Adidas. Its runway show (a dense affair with gimp-masked models marching along the New York Stock Exchange floor) included a more conventionally athletic assortment of twin-logoed tracksuits and soccer jerseys. The collaboration demonstrates \"what we offer aesthetically to our audience. There is a fashion element to it, you know, [and] there is a street element,\" said the brand's mononym designer Demna in an interview backstage.</p><p>The collection went on sale immediately following the show with prices more in line with Bergdorf than Modell's: Trackpants at $1,550 and sneakers at $1,100.</p><p>The catwalk prominence of these partnerships—that three-stripe logo sitting right above a fashion brand's name for look after look, item after item—shows how the chasm between high style and mass apparel has all but closed entirely. (Price, of course, remains an exclusionary factor.)</p><p>Through a representative, Kering declined to comment on whether the two deals were coordinated at the corporate level. According to an Adidas representative, these premium collaborations are part of a new brand strategy the company announced last year. Brian Grevy, Adidas executive board member responsible for global brands, said in March 2021 that luxury designs \"inspired by Adidas and worn for status\" helped create brand heat.</p><p>Luxury sportswear collaborations are hardly new, but recent pair-ups embody a different attitude, said Thom Bettridge, head of creative and content at the online shopping site Ssense. The DNA of sportswear brands is more thoroughly intertwined with luxury production to create a full-spectrum of apparel and shoes—the collaboration is \"becoming a tool rather than a big novelty,\" he said.</p><p>The same weekend as the New York Balenciaga show, Louis Vuitton hosted a Brooklyn exhibition of its collaboration with Nike, one of the final acts of Virgil Abloh, Vuitton's late men's creative director. Comprising 47 Nike Air Force 1s (manufactured by Louis Vuitton, not Nike), the lock-up melded Louis Vuitton's logo with perhaps the one brand mark more recognizable that its petite LV's: the Nike swoosh.</p><p>Going back decades, Adidas has worked with Japanese avant-maestro Yohji Yamamoto (on a specific line, Y-3), Stella McCartney and Raf Simons. \"What put Adidas on the map, collab-wise, was these really kind of foundational collaborations with independent creatives,\" said Mr. Bettridge.</p><p>The crumbling of formality and the recontextualization of sportswear as culturally dominant forced luxury labels to reconsider that separation. Yes, Jackie O. wore Balenciaga, but Missy Elliott, Pharrell, Liam Gallagher? They wore Adidas. To stay relevant, loftier brands increasingly pull from mainstream fashion.</p><p>While the market will have to wait to fully dissect sales of Adidas's recent collaborations, evidence shows that these collaborations do garner eyeballs—and sales. Following the Balenciaga show, online searches for \"tracksuits\" jumped 138% compared to the day before, according to Love the Sales, a British company that tracks ecommerce demand.</p><p>Two years ago, Dior released an Air Jordan collaboration that sold out instantaneously and is still one of the most in-demand shoes on the rabid sneaker resale market. A pair recently sold for $7,700 on resale platform StockX.</p><p>Top clients are already preordering the Louis Vuitton Air Force Ones (which start at $2,750) and the Brooklyn exhibition has garnered lots of foot traffic, according to a brand representative, without providing specific figures. Mr. Abloh, speaking with the Financial Times before his death, said that the Air Force 1s were \"a basketball shoe, but through hip-hop culture it has energized a representative sculpture. It means a lot to very specific people.\"</p><p>That personal connection—specific to each of us, but broadly felt—further underscores why labels are turning to sportswear partners. \"Before I knew fashion I knew Adidas, I had tracksuits my parents bought for me like when I was 7, so that was the first time I actually felt cool,\" said Demna of Balenciaga. \"It has been my dream ever since to put three stripes on everything.\"</p><p>Today, Adidas and Nike are brands worn by soccer-playing kids as much as by pedigreed hedge-fund managers. That mass appeal creates an opportunity. For many customers, a sportswear collaboration will prove to be \"a gateway into designer\" fashion, said Sam Lobban, the executive vice president of designer and new concepts at Nordstrom. \"It's about recruiting more people into the fold of being interested in a designer and luxury space.\"</p><p>Still, if everyone is wearing Adidas, you need to give the luxury consumer some reason to buy the luxury iteration. Sure, price is a factor. The Balenciaga-fied Adidas logo shows that you had the money to blow on a T-shirt.</p><p>But Mr. Lobban also highlighted the oversized very '90s fit of the Balenciaga gear, a signature of Demna's designs—thus demarcating the collaboration as something more than what you could buy at Dick's Sporting Goods.</p><p>\"That sort of designer flip helps drive the demand, the desire around,\" a collaboration. And perhaps, justify the price tag.</p><p>Can Adidas Be Luxury? Balenciaga and Gucci Say Yes</p>",
