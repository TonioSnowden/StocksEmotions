  "text": "<p>The Bank of Japan stunned markets earlier today with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0efa373-062e-4312-916a-b9e86196cae1\">a surprise change to its controversial yield curve control policy</a> (YCC), triggering big swings in the currency, bond and equity markets.</p> <p>The BoJ is the last of the world's key central banks to stick to an ultra-loose monetary policy and government bond purchases to stimulate growth.</p> <p>But like elsewhere in the world, inflation in Japan has risen sharply this year. Core inflation — which excludes volatile food prices — has exceeded the BoJ's 2 per cent target for seven consecutive months, hitting a 40-year high of 3.6 per cent in October.</p> <p>Japan's increasingly extreme outlier status has contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d2a3580-f4b8-4e58-a7f5-a7fe9dce4f3e\">huge fall in the yen</a> this year as markets have priced in the differential with the rate-tightening US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The central bank said today it would allow 10-year bond yields to fluctuate by plus or minus 0.5 per cent, instead of the previous 0.25 per cent. It kept overnight interest rates at minus 0.1 per cent.</p> <p>The move triggered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ac0044-a2d2-4c82-92bc-c52ab0b216cf\">a sell-off in global government bond markets</a>. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 0.47 per cent, its highest since 2015, before easing to 0.41 per cent. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries climbed to a three-week high of 3.65 per cent and Germany's 10-year Bund yield rose to 2.26 per cent.</p> <p>The yen jumped 3.6 per cent to ¥132.2 against the US dollar while the Topix equity index fell as much as 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>Outgoing BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda denied that the policy change amounted to a tightening of monetary policy. He said the change was meant to address increased volatility in global financial markets and improve the functioning of Japan's bond markets.</p> <p>The BoJ's efforts to defend its yield curve targets have contributed to a sustained reduction in market liquidity in the Japanese government bonds market, leading to what some analysts have described as “dysfunction”. </p> <p>The central bank now owns more than half of outstanding government bonds, compared with 11.5 per cent when Kuroda became governor in March 2013.</p> <p>Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore, said the announcement indicated the BoJ was considering a broader exit from its YCC policy, likening it to the 1989 decision to raise interest rates that led to decades of deflation.</p> <p>Benjamin Shatil, foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan, said the move would have ramifications for asset prices around the world “given the potential for continued asset reallocation of Japanese investors from overseas bonds back to domestic bonds”.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9aca1c2-50c6-4040-8322-6ddfacda6cd6\">The costs and risks of the BoJ's policy are rising</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. January 6 Capitol attack panel recommends criminal charges against Donald Trump</strong> The bipartisan nine-member panel unanimously said the US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65adf18f-5d4d-44fd-8a32-0bf8cbd25833\">should prosecute the former president</a> for his role in the failed insurrection on the Capitol last year. Jack Smith, who has taken over the Trump investigations at the justice department, declined to comment.</p> <p><strong>2. Ron Perelman's Revlon stake to be wiped out in bankruptcy settlement</strong> The bankrupt cosmetics maker has reached an agreement with its lenders and bondholders to give them <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ab49585-e0c3-458f-9d1e-9fddd123174d\">ownership of the company</a>. The restructuring agreement will wipe out the interests of controlling shareholder Ron Perelman and see the company raise $650mn in new equity and seek to exit the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process by April.</p> <p><strong>3. India overtakes China in M&amp;A fees for western banks</strong> The world's largest investment banks will earn more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb1fee30-3515-4696-bc40-f032aa22fa6f\">dealmaking fees in India</a> this year than in China for the first time. The milestone is indicative of a broader shift by western finance to diversify away from a decoupling Chinese economy.</p> <p><strong>4. Sam Bankman-Fried agrees to US extradition </strong>The FTX founder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/002e3c2c-184f-45ca-b8da-5871202087ed\">appeared in a Bahamas court yesterday</a>. Bankman-Fried has been resisting extradition to the US but his lawyer said he was prepared to reverse that decision. Jerone Roberts told local media he hoped Bankman-Fried could return to court later this week to formalise his decision to end the extradition fight.</p> <p><strong>5. EU energy ministers reach deal on gas price cap</strong> EU energy ministers reached an agreement to cap gas prices when they hit €180 per megawatt hour <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b2ffae4-04d1-4e09-89ce-b85f575d8422\">for three days in a row</a>. The cap, which should come into force on February 15, is the latest attempt to curb soaring energy prices in the bloc and help consumers after Russia reduced much of its gas exports to Europe.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Trump taxes </strong>The House committee on Ways and Means, which focuses on tax matters, will meet behind closed doors and consider releasing six years of the former president's tax records obtained last month after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7ceaa47-a7c9-4225-b1bd-ee78411045a7\">Supreme Court order</a>. </p> <p><strong>Corporate results</strong> Three months ago FedEx issued a profit warning that triggered the biggest daily fall in the company's shares on record. Today it updates on trading conditions. Nike could provide insight into the latest phase of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9939220e-0d2c-4d43-8d62-03c7905e0123\">Covid-19 in China</a> and its impact on consumer spending and supply chains, and food group General Mills also reports earnings.</p> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>Retail sales in Canada are anticipated to have risen 1.5 per cent in October after falling 0.5 per cent in September as sales of petrol, food and beverages declined. </p> <p><strong>War crimes verdict </strong>A verdict is expected today in a case against Irmgard Furchner, a 97-year-old German woman charged with committing war crimes during the second world war.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Private equity moves into hospital ERs</strong> For a private equity industry that has made billions of dollars by assembling car washes, dentists' offices, and local businesses into efficiently run national chains, a “roll up” of hospital emergency rooms seemed like a sound plan. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5673a288-f55b-4cfd-aa76-0ebb30b029a6\">But the titans of finance had not reckoned on the backlash from doctors</a>.</p> <p><strong>Billionaire Oleg Deripaska's Sochi hotel complex seized </strong>A Russian court has ordered the seizure of the $1bn Imeretinskiy hotel complex and marina owned by billionaire Oleg Deripaska after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32052a11-89f3-4642-8dd4-11433a32f8a2\">the Kremlin asked the oligarch to stop criticising the war</a>, the FT has been told by people familiar with the matter.</p> <p><strong>Bill Gates: Twitter is ‘stirring up' digital polarisation</strong> A “seat-of-the-pants” decision-making style at Twitter since Elon Musk's takeover <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8759f405-62df-4df5-a024-c45bdb1a3622\">is worsening digital polarisation</a>, according to the co-founder of Microsoft. Social media platforms “need to focus on the things that incite riots or lead to huge misconceptions about the safety of vaccines or masks, or those types of things,” the co-chair of the world's largest private philanthropic organisation told the FT.</p> <p><strong>The year ahead for markets</strong> Unhedged newsletter author Robert Armstrong gets out his crystal ball and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc767358-d9f1-494e-b83c-c18730a01b4f\">predicts the risks and opportunities</a> that lie ahead for global asset prices next year. “It is only a slight exaggeration . . . to say that the whole point of making predictions is that they create an opportunity to be wrong,” Robert writes. </p> <p><strong>Silicon Valley start-ups race for debt deals in funding crunch</strong> A sharp decline in venture capital dealmaking and a closed market for initial public offerings have resulted in a funding crunch for many private technology companies, leading start-ups that have traditionally relied on deep-pocketed Silicon Valley investors to turn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d12a4baa-53c6-4256-b125-d25622f9555f\">alternative financing deals</a>.</p> <h1>Best pop albums of 2022</h1> <p>Pop critic Ludovic Hunter-Tilney picks his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7862c60-4f4d-402b-9c58-22b44702acc0\">10 favourite albums of the year</a>. </p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Sophia Smith  2022 'FirstFT: The final domino to fall?'
