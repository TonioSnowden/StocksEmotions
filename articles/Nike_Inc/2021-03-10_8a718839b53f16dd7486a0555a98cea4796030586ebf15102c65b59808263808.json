  "title": "World News: Argentina's Economy Slows to a Crawl --- President aims to lift country out of the crisis by taxing the rich and the farm sector",
  "text": "<p>\"There's a lot of uncertainty. They are implementing crazy policies that don't make much sense,\" Mr. Rotondo said. \"There will be less investments, less production, and that'll be very negative.\"</p><p>Three years into a grinding recession, Argentina's economy is in the worst shape it has been since a 2001 debt default that led to rioting and deaths in the streets. For Mr. Fernandez, the solution is to kick-start the economy and tax a prosperous farm sector and wealthy individuals, while avoiding austerity measures such as cutbacks to billions of dollars a year in subsidies.</p><p>\"Industry will be the motor of the country's reconstruction,\" the president has said.</p><p>The challenges are steep. The country's total stock-market valuation has collapsed from $350 billion in 2018 to $20 billion last year, according to EcoGo, an economic consulting firm. The economy shrank 10% in 2020, one of the world's worst contractions during the pandemic. Poverty has risen to more than 44%, according to the Catholic University, the highest since the early 2000s.</p><p>Business owners -- from tech titans to airline executives and the farmers and ranchers who power what was once one of the world's wealthiest nations -- say they see little hope for a recovery in Latin America's third-biggest economy.</p><p>\"I'm not sure where growth will come from,\" said Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former central-bank chief economist and dean of Torcuato diTella University's School of Government in Buenos Aires. The government doesn't have the resources to stimulate the economy, he said, \"and businesses are pulling back on investments.\"</p><p>Debt payments are looming and Argentina is virtually broke, with just $5 billion in cash and gold reserves, half of what is on hand in neighboring Uruguay, whose population is 8% of Argentina's 45 million.</p><p>Facing the crisis, Mr. Fernandez's government is implementing interventionist policies that will undermine hopes of increasing investments needed to generate employment, said Carlos Melconian, an economist and former chief of the country's top state-run bank.</p><p>\"The measures are going to fail,\" he said. \"There are no investments.\"</p><p>Argentina has banned companies from laying off workers, frozen telecom prices and increased export taxes on soybeans, wheat and corn. The government last year paid up to 50% of the salaries of workers at tens of thousands of small businesses. It also has restricted corporations from accessing dollars needed to service foreign debt.</p><p>The government says the measures will protect jobs and households struggling with a 36% inflation rate. The economy is starting to recover, Finance Minister Martin Guzman said in an interview. He explained that capital controls are needed to prevent a depletion of reserves. \"It is a remedy to a worse evil,\" he said.</p><p>Several foreign companies, including Walmart, Nike and regional airline Latam, have abandoned Argentina. Some of the country's most successful entrepreneurs have packed their bags for Uruguay, which offers what Argentina doesn't: A business-friendly and stable economy.</p><p>\"The day-to-day became unbearable,\" said Marga Clavell, a Harvard-trained corporate lawyer who moved to Uruguay in October. \"There is a feeling like the country is closing itself off to the world, once again.\"</p><p>The ban on firing workers was intended to protect jobs during the start of the pandemic when the government enacted a strict lockdown. But a year later, business owners say it is saddling them with more costs in what already was a restrictive labor market.</p><p>\"It is really serious, it's a big problem for the economy,\" said Blas Briceno, the chief executive of Finnegans, a software company.\"We have people who are not performing, who are not adequate for the position, but we can't let them go.\"</p><p>Mr. Fernandez, a member of the nationalist Peronist movement, inherited a highly indebted economy upon taking office in December 2019. A currency crisis had forced his predecessor, Mauricio Macri, to request a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, which now seeks payment on $44 billion.</p><p>Mr. Fernandez is betting that the global economic recovery will mean higher prices for grain exports, helping rebuild reserves. The idea is to spend, even if it means accelerating the money printing that has sustained Argentina thus far.</p><p>There have been some gains. Whirlpool has plans to open a new plant that the government says would create 1,000 jobs. Canada's Lundin mining company said in February it will invest $3 billion to build a gold and silver mine.</p><p>Mr. Guzman, the finance minister, said the economy should grow fast enough this year to reduce the fiscal deficit to 6% of gross domestic product from 8.5% in 2020.</p><p>Some of Argentina's most important companies are reeling. In February, state oil company YPF was pushed to the brink of its first default after it couldn't access dollars to pay $413 million in debt. Private creditors agreed to restructure.</p>",
