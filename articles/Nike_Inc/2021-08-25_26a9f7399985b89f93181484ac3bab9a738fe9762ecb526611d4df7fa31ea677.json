  "text": "<p>Klarna's losses increased significantly in the second quarter as the highly valued Swedish “buy now, pay later” company continued its breakneck pace of growth ahead of a possible stock market listing.</p> <p>The fintech, most recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f73b352-723f-471b-b098-5f090279b5bb\">valued at $46bn</a> in an investment round led by Japan's SoftBank, increased the volume of purchases it processed on behalf of retailers by two-thirds in the second quarter to $20bn.</p> <p>But its operating losses <a href=\"https://www.klarna.com/assets/sites/15/2021/08/24184609/Klarna-Bank-AB-Interim-Report-2021-EN.pdf\">soared</a> from SKr89m ($10m) a year earlier to SKr965m ($111m) as credit losses more than doubled in the second quarter.</p> <p>Klarna was one of the rare fintechs to be consistently profitable in its first 14 years but has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41adb97a-5870-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc\">lossmaking since 2019</a> as it had expanded rapidly, particularly in the US. Volumes in the US increased 311 per cent in the first half as Klarna attracted 20m customers to its services for payments at retailers such as Nike, H&amp;M and Macy's.</p> <p>The Swedish fintech said credit losses tended to increase when it entered new markets such as recent launches in New Zealand, France, and Spain. It added Poland last week.</p> <p>For the first half as a whole, its credit losses grew less quickly than its gross merchandise volumes — a 55 per cent increase for credit losses versus a 77 per cent rise for volumes. Its operating loss in the second quarter of 2020 was substantially lower than in the first quarter of that year, but Klarna could not immediately explain why that was the case. </p> <p>Chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Financial Times on Wednesday that he was “happy with the loss development” as in the first half credit defaults had gone down as a proportion of volumes. </p> <p>He added: “If you're a small bank you'll have small losses, if you're a big bank you can have bigger losses. At the same point of time that we're growing this bank at a fast pace, then you're going to have more losses as you're going to have more revenues and volume.”</p> <p>Klarna has faced controversy in some countries as critics have argued it encourages younger people to spend money that they do not necessarily have and then pay back in instalments. </p> <p>Klarna previously said it was working towards a stock market listing but that nothing was imminent. Siemiatkowski has said that the US was a natural place for a listing but has also hinted that the UK was in the running, and he was lobbying the government in London over its potential regulation of the buy now, pay later sector.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca0cd23a-2d19-4db6-ab63-c0c0cdcaf589\">told</a> the FT in May: “As Brexit has happened, it gives London an opportunity to write even better regulations for the financial sector. That is going to benefit London standing outside of the EU . . . People expected all the banks will move away [from the UK]; I think it's the opposite.”</p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2021 'Klarna's losses soar as credit defaults double' FT.com 25 August.
