  "text": "<p>Foot Locker Inc. named former Ulta Beauty Inc. Chief Executive Mary Dillon as its next CEO, succeeding Richard Johnson, who is retiring.</p><p>Ms. Dillon will take up her new post and join the company's board on Sept. 1. Mr. Johnson, who is 64 years old, will remain executive chairman through Jan. 31, 2023. He will then become a senior adviser to the CEO until early April 2023.</p><p>Foot Locker's lead independent director, Dona Young, will assume the role of nonexecutive chairman on Feb. 1, making Foot Locker one of a few publicly traded companies to have women in the top two jobs.</p><p>Mr. Johnson said the board evaluated internal and external candidates and that Ms. Dillon's strong record at Ulta and McDonald's Corp., where she previously served as chief marketing officer, made her the obvious choice.</p><p>Ms. Dillon, who is 61, would be one of a small number of women leading a publicly traded company. In the S&amp;P 500, about 30 CEOs are women, according to data from the Conference Board and data-analytics firm Esgauge. That is up from five years ago, but women still lead only roughly 6% of S&amp;P 500 companies.</p><p>Ms. Dillon is taking the helm of the athletic-goods chain, which operates about 2,800 stores in 28 countries, as it tries to shift out of shopping malls and lessen its dependence on Nike Inc., which is curtailing shipments to retailers as it focuses on selling more of its goods directly to consumers. Nike accounted for 70% of Foot Locker's merchandise purchases in 2021. The chain said in February that no single vendor will make up more than 60% of total purchases in the current fiscal year.</p><p>The company's shares are down more than 40% over the past year.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's the way forward for Foot Locker under its new CEO? Join the conversation below.</p><p>One of Ms. Dillon's mandates will be to improve Foot Locker's digital operations, something she was able to do at Ulta, where e-commerce accounted for more than 30% of the beauty company's sales in the year ended Jan. 30, 2021, just before she stepped down. E-commerce accounted for about 4% of Ulta's sales during her first year on the job.</p><p>\"Ninety-nine percent of our customers connect with us digitally but only 20% buy digitally,\" Mr. Johnson said in an interview. \"How can we create a better experience for them to click and buy?\"</p><p>Ms. Dillon was brought up in Chicago with her father, who was a steelworker, and mother, a homemaker. They raised her and her five siblings in a bungalow with a single bathroom.</p><p>She subsidized her marketing degree at the University of Illinois Chicago by waiting tables, cleaning apartments and tutoring. After graduating, she entered Quaker Oats Co.'s brand-management training program and landed her first executive role there at age 27. After PepsiCo acquired the company in 2001, she rose to run the Quaker Foods division.</p><p>Her next gig was at McDonald's, where she became the global marketing chief in 2005. The mother of four tried to improve the chain's nutritional image among parents by revamping its Happy Meal.</p><p>In 2010, she joined wireless carrier U.S. Cellular as CEO, and spent three years at the company.</p><p>Over her eight years as Ulta CEO, she expanded the company's e-commerce operations while streamlining its supply chain. During her tenure, the retailer's market capitalization nearly tripled and its store count doubled. She remained executive chairman for a year after relinquishing the CEO role. </p><p>Foot Locker plans to open more stores outside shopping malls.

He oversaw the company's push into Asia, with store openings in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as investments in sneaker marketplace Goat Group and children's wear brand Rockets of Awesome.</p><p>He was also the architect of Foot Locker's push to pivot from U.S. shopping malls. The company has 100 Power Stores that are located outside malls and showcase products tailored to the local community. It plans to open another 200 of these stores through 2024. Last year, Foot Locker bought two smaller retailers for $1.1 billion in a further attempt to expand beyond malls.</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@dowjones.com</p><p>Foot Locker Names Former Ulta Boss Mary Dillon as Next CEO</p>",
