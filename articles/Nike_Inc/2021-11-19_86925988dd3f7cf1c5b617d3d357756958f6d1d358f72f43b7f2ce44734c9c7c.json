  "text": "<p>As we fire more and more wonderful tech into orbit around the Earth, the need grows for increased “space traffic control” and simple garbage collection tech to cope with decay and inevitable obsolescence.</p> <p>The problem of space debris has been highlighted this week by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f14822d-428d-49c6-9420-c934d72db264\">Russia blowing apart</a> one of its own satellites in a test of an anti-satellite missile. The US protested that it generated more than 1,500 pieces of “trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris”, threatening people working at the International Space Station and “other human space flight activities”.</p> <p>There is no tech deployed to date that can “Hoover” up such potentially deadly fragments. Japan's<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-worlds-first-space-sweeper-make-dent-orbiting-debris-180978515/\"> Astroscale is the closest </a>we have to a space clean-up company. Its ELSA-d prototype<a href=\"https://astroscale.com/astroscales-elsa-d-successfully-demonstrates-repeated-magnetic-capture/\"> successfully demonstrated </a>in August how it could magnetically capture redundant satellites, with the aim of towing them away to disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere as they descend. UK satellite company OneWeb is already fitting its latest satellites with compatible magnetic docking plates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d64ae31f-f332-41f4-a662-9a65e6262800\">Katrina Manson and Max Seddon report</a> the debris cloud created by Russia in low earth orbit threatens to affect hundreds of commercial satellites, including from SpaceX and the US imaging company Planet, while refocusing rising tensions between Russia and the US on the escalating weaponisation of space.</p> <p>“They basically set off a bomb in the middle of the new space race,” said Daniel Ceperley, chief executive and co-founder of Leo Labs, which uses radar to track objects in space to prevent collisions.</p> <p>The Californian company recently received a follow-on investment from Seraphim&#xa0;Space Investment Trust, the world's first listed SpaceTech fund, which <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/SSIT/q1-results/15218230\">reported September quarter results today </a>after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2aa56238-d924-4558-9190-753079cc469a\">listing in London</a> in July.</p> <p>Seraphim said it had also invested in antenna, earth observation and navigation companies. “The SpaceTech investment market remains buoyant, with record levels of private investment,” said CEO Mark Boggett. Its research shows $6.4bn was invested in SpaceTech in the first half of this year and nearly 600 satellites were launched in the second quarter. Anyone with good ideas on how to enable a circular economy for the thousands of objects circling the earth ought to be getting some of that money as well.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. US states investigate Instagram's targeting of younger users&#xa0;<br></strong>At least nine states are examining whether Facebook violated consumer protection laws and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77cdbbe1-2b47-4419-b767-7e85b3085f5d\">“put the public at risk”</a>&#xa0;by promoting Instagram to children and young adults, “despite knowing that such use is associated with physical and mental health harms”, according to Maura Healey, Massachusetts' attorney-general.</p> <p><strong>​​​​​2.
