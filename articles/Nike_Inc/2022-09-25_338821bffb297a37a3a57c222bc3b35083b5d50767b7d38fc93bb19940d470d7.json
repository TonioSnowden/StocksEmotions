  "title": "Eliud Kipchoge Lowers His Own Marathon World Record by Half a Minute; The 37-year-old Kenyan set the mark of 2:01:09 on Sunday while winning the Berlin Marathon",
  "text": "<p>\"I am overjoyed to have broken the world record in Berlin,\" Kipchoge said, according to World Athletics. \"I wanted to run the first half so fast. No limitations.\"</p><p>\"After 38 kilometers [23.6 miles] I knew I would be capable of breaking the world record. The circumstances were great, and so was the organization of the event. I'm really happy with today and impressed by the fans and their support.\"</p><p>Both of Kipchoge's world-record times, including his earlier world record set in 2018, came while he wore a new wave of springy, thick-soled shoes made by Nike that triggered a wave of copycats by other brands. World Athletics, the governing body of competitive running, grandfathered in most of the changes rather than banning the new designs.</p><p>Kipchoge ran the first half of Sunday's marathon in a blistering 59:50. His pace slowed slightly in the second half but, still on world-record pace, he pulled away from his competitors and ran the rest of the way alone.</p><p>Around the 25-mile mark of the 26.2-mile race, Kipchoge had stretched his lead to more than four minutes. Kenya's Mark Korir finished 4 minutes, 49 seconds behind Kipchoge in 2:05:58.</p><p>Kipchoge has won the past two Olympic marathon gold medals, along with a silver and bronze in the Olympic 5,000 meter races in 2008 and 2004, respectively.</p><p>He's won 10 World Marathon Majors races since 2014, including four in Berlin, four in London, one in Tokyo and one in Chicago. He finished second in Berlin in 2013.</p><p>Kipchoge also set his 2018 world record in Berlin. The flat course, and a race typically held during the cool weather of September, has been the site of the past eight fastest world men's marathon marks.</p><p>It was a fast day on the course overall. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tigist Assefa smashed the course record by more than two minutes in a time of 2:15:37. Kenya's Brigid Kosgei holds the women's marathon world record of 2:14:04, set in 2019 in Chicago.</p><p>In October 2019, Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon in under two hours, though it doesn't count as a world record. On a closed course in Vienna, and helped by pace-setting runners and wearing Nike Vaporfly shoes, Kipchoge finished in 1 hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds.</p><p>On Sunday, Kipchoge wore Nike's Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT% 2, a model that launched in June, according to the brand.</p><p>Nike set in motion changes industry-wide when its sponsored runners wore bulky-looking prototypes at the 2016 U.S. Olympic marathon trials.</p><p>The shoes, characterized by thick, superlight soles fitted with carbon-fiber plates, have contributed to faster times, according to academic studies.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Eliud Kipchoge Lowers His Own Marathon World Record by Half a Minute</p>",
