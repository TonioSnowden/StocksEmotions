  "text": "<p>But she's not done yet.</p><p>Read more: Serena Williams wins again at U.S. Open, but really, can she ever lose?</p><p>Williams, who was the underdog going into the second-round match, won against No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.</p><p>She was cheered on by fellow Nike NKE athlete and friend Tiger Woods.</p><p>Woods later tweeted, \"It was a pleasure to watch greatness.\"</p><p>And joining Woods in the crowd was legendary New York filmmaker Spike Lee.</p><p>\"Euphoria\" and \"Dune\" star Zendaya was also seen lighting up the stands.</p><p>And of course, Serena's big sis and fellow tennis star Venus Williams was there cheering her little sister on. Williams' player's box also included her husband, investor Alexis Ohanian, as well as her daughter Olympia, who turns 5 on Thursday, her mother Oracene Price — and \"Vogue\" editor Anna Wintour. Williams' \"Vogue\" cover story for September is what told the world she plans to evolve from tennis — and what set U.S. Open ticket prices skyrocketing.</p><p>With the majority of the crowd (loudly) behind her — in fact, Williams shushed them at one point with the wag of a finger — Williams powered through a match where she was the heavy underdog, showing a fighting spirit that she is assuredly going to bring to the next evolution to her life.</p><p>Indeed, Williams said in Vogue that she wants to focus on growing her family and her venture capital firm once done playing tennis — but she still has more matches to play in New York. Williams will play again on Friday against Ajla Tomljanović. And she'll be in a doubles match with her sister Venus on Thursday.</p><p>\"Serena\" was trending on Twitter throughout Wednesday night's match, where more stars tweeted hail to the queen.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris thanked her for \"inspiring people around the world with your talent, grace, and determination both on and off the court.\"</p><p>And NBA star Stephen Curry tweeted, \"Not done yet.\"</p><p>Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles under her belt already — the most of any man or woman in the Open Era, which began in 1968.</p><p>Serena Williams draws star-studded U.S. Open crowd, including Tiger Woods, Spike Lee, Zendaya</p>",
