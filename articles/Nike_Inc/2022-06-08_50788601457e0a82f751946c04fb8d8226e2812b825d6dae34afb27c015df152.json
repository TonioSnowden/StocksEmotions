  "title": "Nike to End Run Club App in China; U.S. businesses have restructured digital services in the country amid toughening rules and competition",
  "text": "<p>Nike didn't give a clear reason on why it is halting the app. On the app, it suggested that users shift to a Nike mini app on WeChat, a ubiquitous Chinese tech platform run by Tencent Holdings Inc. The mini app offers video training sessions of indoor activities and records the time users spend on these sessions.</p><p>\"We are creating an ecosystem from China for China, specifically catered to the region's unique consumer needs to serve athletes better,\" Nike said.</p><p>Nike is one of the biggest athletic sportswear brands in China, the world's biggest consumer market, but has been struggling to stay competitive as local sportswear makers like Anta Sports Products Ltd. have gained ground on Western brands.</p><p>The Greater China market was the only region in which Nike's sales declined year-over-year during its fiscal third quarter ended in February, the most recent results available. In the quarter, sales fell 5% to $2.16 billion in Greater China.</p><p>The Nike Run Club is also losing ground to its local competitors including Keep, Joyrun and Codoon, which have much larger user numbers than Nike. Runtastic, another running app owned by Adidas, exited from the China market last year, after failing to cater to local users.</p><p>Meanwhile, Beijing's toughening rules for businesses, as well as worsening U.S.-China ties and China's stringent pandemic-control rules have added to headwinds for American companies.</p><p>Challenges include China's stringent censorship practices, its law mandating customer data collected on the mainland be stored there, as well as its data-privacy laws, which require any organization or individual handling Chinese citizens' personal data to minimize data collection and to obtain prior consent.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft Corp.'s LinkedIn shut down its social-media service in China and Yahoo Inc. also pulled out of the country, both citing an increasingly challenging business and legal environment. This month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would close its Kindle digital bookstore in China in a year. Airbnb Inc. plans to close its domestic business in China after harsh Covid-19 lockdowns in the country compounded the pain from mounting local competition.</p><p>In China, Nike has been investing in rebuilding consumer connections through marketing campaigns, the company has said. In November, it completed a research and development center in Shenzhen. Nike also plans to create new partnerships with retailers in the country, and executives have said they expect results for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended in May, to show improvement.</p><p>Nike is set to release its results for the quarter on June 27.</p><p>Write to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com</p><p>Nike to End Run Club App in China</p>",
