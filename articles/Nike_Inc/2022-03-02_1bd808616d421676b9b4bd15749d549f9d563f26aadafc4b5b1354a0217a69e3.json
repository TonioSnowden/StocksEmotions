  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc93a656-5305-4642-9bc5-6922e33faa06\">Crude oil</a> at an eight-year high, European natural gas at an all-time record and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cde1a3c5-9143-457c-9e9f-a09edfec8148#post-0fc3c7d3-1198-479b-ac6a-a8a221506b10\">wheat</a> at its most expensive in 14 years: it was another day of records as the crisis in Ukraine drove <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cde1a3c5-9143-457c-9e9f-a09edfec8148#post-1dd8ecfa-a921-464d-9306-661374015bcf\">commodities prices</a> to their highest level in more than a decade.</p> <p>But the Russian invasion has not just pushed up prices in already-strained markets; it has also highlighted the use of raw materials as a foreign policy weapon.</p> <p>“Commodities have been weaponised for a long, long time . . . it's always a question of when does a state pull the trigger,” says Frank Fannon, former assistant US secretary of state for energy resources.</p> <p>As our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf0212cf-21f3-4520-ae5f-136ce3f78afc\">Big Read</a> explains, this began a decade ago with US fears of China's control of supplies of rare earths — the metals used in many aspects of manufacturing. The reliance on a handful of countries or companies for raw materials was then highlighted by the pandemic. And now the Ukraine crisis has focused minds on Russia's position as a key supplier of oil, gas, wheat, aluminium and palladium. </p> <p>Although it is the world's third-biggest producer after the US and Saudi Arabia, demand for Russia's oil has collapsed as big users turn away following the invasion of Ukraine. This has left 70 per cent of its crude “struggling to find buyers” and helped drive up prices and pose a serious risk to global recovery.</p> <p>“Brent crude is the biggest fear factor for equity markets,” said one <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fa4f034-6466-4c92-a5e7-e0ffe80df74f\">investment executive</a>. “If it goes ballistic and moves towards $150 or more a barrel, then [economic] growth really gets hammered.”&#xa0;Moves by the US and others to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfdacf01-ea21-4184-aa39-bd3a5577c3d1\">tap into reserves</a> failed to stop the price passing the $113 mark earlier today.</p> <p>As columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f2c3627-120b-4a09-93e5-4bf265eb76e1\">Helen Thomas</a> points out, the current crisis puts paid to the notion, if it still existed, that investors could ignore geopolitical risk, citing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b4968fa-40d8-40ae-b2f9-f12cd8b23f9c\">BP's</a> cutting of ties with Russia as a significant moment. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76db0e18-7c7e-4b96-9ee5-81dcfca18f34\">ExxonMobil</a>&#xa0;and Shell have followed suit, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d8c808b-c863-492c-8b40-97e243bb0071\">Total</a> is under similar pressure. </p> <p>The UK meanwhile has started an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41620abc-2a5d-401a-bae0-24652169b5c2\">urgent review</a> of exposure to Russian gas and energy groups. Prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that households would have to live with higher energy prices as the cost of inflicting “pain” on Russia through sanctions.</p> <p>Writing in the FT, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64dccfd4-aec3-46ad-bad6-f4420e5ca093\">Robin Brooks</a>, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, underlines the point that the war on Ukraine is not only a watershed for European politics, but also a big turning point for markets.</p> <p>“All that anxiety about inflation is now old news,” he says. “What's unfolding is a major <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1498970843304636420\">negative shock to Europe</a>.”</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The White House unveiled a new road map for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/02/1083905865/the-white-house-has-a-new-plan-for-covid-19-aimed-at-getting-things-back-to-norm\">living with Covid</a> (NPR)</p></li>  <li><p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bdc488a-fc2b-410e-a62a-f2d785829f32\">World Bank adviser</a> has become the first Russian official to resign from a prominent position at an international body in protest at the invasion of Ukraine</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cde1a3c5-9143-457c-9e9f-a09edfec8148#post-8fb5c9d5-8255-4deb-ab1a-cde131c10c7d\">Trafigura</a>, one of the world's biggest energy traders, is reviewing its investment in a project being developed by Russian oil producer Rosneft</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cde1a3c5-9143-457c-9e9f-a09edfec8148\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Eurozone inflation</strong> hit a new record of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7055867-80b2-4187-b4a4-1bf600dcc32b\">5.8 per cent</a> in February, adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to speed up the unwinding of its stimulus programme and raise interest rates. Energy prices rose a record 31.7 per cent, while unprocessed food prices climbed 6.1 per cent. The highest national annual rate was in Lithuania at 13.9 per cent, while France had the lowest at 4.1 per cent. <em>Compare inflation rates across the world with our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\"><em>global tracker</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>US Federal Reserve chair <strong>Jay Powell</strong> told Congress that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b947c196-7b5c-44b0-8769-ef6f66580356\">rate rise</a> would go ahead this month, despite the Ukraine war. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0886ebb2-a9a5-45d6-9577-559aab413286\">Investors have been betting</a> that the crisis would slow moves to <strong>tighten policy</strong> at the Fed and the ECB, a view also reflected by the head of <strong>Man Group</strong>, the world's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76eaa674-1dc9-4faa-8060-695ef540ebc6\">largest hedge fund</a>.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> told a parliamentary committee that the economy and public finances were “vulnerable” to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05ec9960-557d-4588-9117-778c094a3ffa\">higher inflation</a> and interest rates, suggesting that tough decisions could be required in the months ahead. Business groups have called for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25fdcc3e-6cc4-4d96-af8e-e5704e01073b\">tax breaks</a>, but Sunak is not expected to make big changes to taxation or public spending in his spring statement on March 23.</p> <p>One area that seems to be unruffled by the surge in inflation is the <strong>UK housing market</strong>: prices rose again in February in the biggest increase in cash terms <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1a6e982-a596-4b53-b82c-f52308423f73\">since 1991</a>, making the average house price £29,000 more expensive than a year ago.</p> <p>The <strong>Italian economy</strong> grew a better than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04987ba4-1ac8-4fd6-b44a-2b83895f6256\">6.6 per cent</a> last year after a 9 per cent contraction in 2020, with a lower fiscal deficit than expected as investment, consumption and exports all bounced back. Italy is set to be the largest recipient of the EU's Covid recovery fund, and will potentially be eligible for nearly €200bn in grants and loans. </p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p><strong>Australia's economy</strong> is now bigger than it was pre-pandemic after a strong recovery in the fourth quarter when consumers emerged from lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37c8074f-be3b-4254-9682-24f1c836156e\">GDP grew 3.4 per cent</a> in the final three months of 2021, compared with a 1.9 per cent contraction in the third quarter, when restrictions to quell an outbreak of the Delta variant threatened to push the country into recession.</p> <p>Panic buying broke out in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> as local residents prepared for a new and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3fe00fb-5f82-4bc1-b15d-52e108143ec3\">stricter lockdown</a>.

Russia-exposed funds with more than €4bn in assets have been frozen in Europe, meaning investors have no idea when they might be able to withdraw their money.
