  "title": "Biden Proposal Narrows Impact Of Minimum 15% Corporate Tax",
  "text": "<p>The Biden plan would now also let companies subject to the tax get the benefit of tax credits for research, renewable energy and low-income housing, a recognition that the campaign-trail version could have undercut the president's preference to encourage companies to invest in those areas.</p><p>The result is that just 180 companies would meet the income threshold and just 45 would pay the tax, according to administration estimates that assume the rest of the administration's plan gets implemented. Nearly 1,100 U.S.-listed companies would meet the $100 million threshold, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Many of them would still face sharply higher tax bills from the rest of the Biden proposals, which raise rates on domestic and foreign income.</p><p>The 15% minimum tax \"is a targeted approach to ensure that the most aggressive tax avoiders are forced to bear meaningful tax liabilities,\" the Treasury Department said.</p><p>A Treasury report outlines the arguments for the Democratic administration's broader push, which would raise more than $2 trillion over 15 years to pay for eight years of spending on roads, bridges, transit, broadband and other infrastructure projects.</p><p>The administration argued that the current corporate tax system raises too little money and contains features that encourage companies to shift jobs abroad. Mr. Biden faces an uphill challenge to get his plan through Congress with slim majorities and some moderate Democrats already calling for smaller tax increases.</p><p>The administration's overall plan includes partly reversing the GOP Congress's 2017 reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, boosting it to 28%. It also involves changing several key features of that tax law and rallying the world for minimum tax rates on corporate income. The Biden administration's less aggressive version of the 15% minimum tax on financial-statement income suggests that this particular idea is taking a back seat as policy is being written.</p><p>The Treasury Department report argues that the 2017 tax cuts went too far and generated little economic benefit, pointing out that foreign investors received a significant share of any gains.</p><p>\"It changes the game we play,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said of the administration's tax plan. \"America will compete on our ability to produce talented workers, cutting-edge research and state-of-the-art infrastructure, not on whether we have lower tax rates than Bermuda or Switzerland.\"</p><p>Business groups object to the tax proposals as a whole, arguing that they would hurt investment and U.S. companies' ability to compete for global business.</p><p>\"While we share Secretary Yellen's goal of a competitive international stage, imposing noncompetitive taxes on American companies would have the complete opposite effect,\" a coalition of business groups said this week.</p><p>Ms. Yellen said the tax changes would generate revenue to pay for spending on infrastructure, research and development and other investments that, by 2024, would add an extra 1.6% to U.S. gross domestic product.</p><p>The administration also wants to impose a 21% minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign income and get other countries to do the same. To prod other nations to adopt such taxes, the new plan includes tough limits on deductions for foreign-headquartered companies from countries that don't adopt them.</p><p>Finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading economies, meeting virtually on Wednesday, said they hope to agree on a minimum tax rate for corporate profits by midyear as part of an overhaul of the way international businesses are taxed.</p><p>Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco said Ms. Yellen's proposal was consistent with the G-20's ambitions. \"What we see this year is an acceleration in the process, and the G-20 is expecting to reach an agreement in July,\" said Mr. Franco, who chaired the meeting.</p><p>Tax lawyers and accountants have argued that a 15% minimum tax on financial-statement income could be difficult to administer and implement and would cede some U.S. tax rules to accounting regulators.</p><p>There are a variety of reasons why large companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Nike Inc. can report significant profits and tax rates significantly below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%. And it is difficult to tell which companies would get affected by this tax or by other pieces of the Biden agenda. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos endorsed a corporate tax rate increase this week, but that is different from the minimum tax proposal.</p><p>Some companies' low tax bills stem from the differences between the definition of income for financial statements and the definition for taxes. Companies can, for example, immediately deduct many capital investments for tax purposes but must depreciate them over time for investors. That can lead to lower tax payments in the short run and create a gap between tax income and book income. Tax and financial accounting rules also differ for deductions for stock-based compensation.</p><p>Companies can also report tax bills below the statutory rate because of intentional tax breaks authorized by Congress. Those include the credits for research, housing and renewable energy that the Treasury carved out of the new tax Wednesday. That change would focus the tax on companies engaged in profit-shifting and not on activities that the government wants to encourage, Treasury officials said.</p>",
