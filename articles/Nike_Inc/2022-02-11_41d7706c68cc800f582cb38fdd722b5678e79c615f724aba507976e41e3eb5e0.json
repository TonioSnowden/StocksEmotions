  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>More than half a dozen senior Credit Suisse managers, as well as its legal department, were aware that a group of clients <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c268d9a5-5d0b-4512-8dfa-5b8ea0de15cb\">were potentially violent drug-smuggling criminals</a>, but approved millions of euros in transactions for them before freezing their accounts, a court has heard.</p> <h2>Sanjeev Gupta: the taxman cometh&#xa0;</h2> <p>What do you do when the government tries to shut your companies down because of tens of millions of pounds in unpaid taxes?</p> <p>Here's an idea from <strong>GFG Alliance</strong>, the metals conglomerate run by <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong> which is under a fraud investigation: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276d5655-7190-4813-a4d8-e40c66e94e64\">offer them £500 per month</a>. </p> <p>Yes, you read that correctly. </p> <p>Four of Gupta's companies owe the UK tax authority, <strong>HM Revenue &amp; Customs</strong>, a combined £26.4mn. Almost £20mn of that sum is owed by <strong>Speciality Steel UK</strong>. </p> <p>Gupta has been racing to find new funding since GFG's main lender <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> collapsed almost a year ago. The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb71988a-e4ba-4bf9-8025-ce26ff355e66\">revealed in March</a> that his plants had missed payments to the tax authorities. </p> <p>As for how Gupta planned to manage this, we'll let HMRC take it from here. This is what their court filings, obtained by DD's Kaye Wiggins, say. (Note: “The Company” is Speciality Steel and “The Petitioner” is the tax authority.) </p> <p>“In a telephone call on 1 February 2022, The Company offered to pay £500 per month until July when they would know the outcome of restructuring. With a debt of £19,822,511.35, The Petitioner feels that £500 per month is not a reasonable offer, especially as they do not know what the outcome of the restructuring is likely to be.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The tax authority said the restructuring might have “no, or very little, impact” on the company's ability to increase the monthly payment. It concluded that Speciality Steel “is unable to pay its debts” and that “in the circumstances it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up”.&#xa0;</p> <p>For context: at a rate of £500 per month, it would take about 3,333 years to repay the sum, not including interest. </p> <p>Anyhow, Gupta's companies are due in a London court next month to fight their case over the attempt to shut them down. </p> <p>If the government succeeds, the consequences could be huge: the four businesses that HMRC is pursuing employ just over 2,000 people directly, including at Liberty's two main plants at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in Yorkshire.</p> <p>The local MP, Labour's <strong>Sarah Champion</strong>, isn't happy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahChampionMP/status/1491752029978566658\">Here's her tweet</a> in response to the move: </p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahChampionMP/status/1491752029978566658\">https://twitter.com/SarahChampionMP/status/1491752029978566658</a> <p>Still, it's a sign that some within the UK establishment, whose politicians for years heralded Gupta as the “saviour of steel”, now seem to believe that the steel industry needs rescuing from its erstwhile saviour.</p> <h2>The renegade executive that could thwart Arm's IPO plans</h2> <p>If you asked his critics several years ago, <strong>Allen Wu </strong>had taken on the role of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc55d4c9-1065-4db0-98a4-f7f0c1de563b\">“China's answer to <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>”</a> with gusto.</p> <p>Like <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s Son, the chair and chief executive of the China unit of UK chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> had big plans to build an investment empire, and was willing to overlook internal compliance tensions to see it through.</p> <p>But now Wu looks more like Son's adversary than acolyte, as the rebel Chinese unit threatens to derail SoftBank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e1ca412-da98-4a59-9a9b-431e13b0f800\">plans to float Arm</a> following a collapsed $66bn sale to US semiconductor group<strong> Nvidia</strong>.</p> <p>He could be what stands between SoftBank and its chances of bouncing back from what would have been the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a13c146-21cb-428a-9771-fcffe9d0023b\">largest deal ever</a> in the chip sector.</p> <p>Wu's repeated clashes with SoftBank's ambitions mark a swift departure from an arrangement that had once suited everyone involved.</p> <p>Wu was elevated to the top job at Arm China in 2018. Its UK parent, which was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/235b1af4-4c7f-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc\">acquired</a> by SoftBank a few years before, had just sold a 51 per cent interest in its Chinese subsidiary to a consortium of local financial investors and Arm partners.</p> <p>SoftBank's move to relinquish control of its Chinese operation was viewed as a <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Arm-s-China-joint-venture-ensures-access-to-vital-technology\">big victory for Beijing</a>, whose long-held goal to build out its own chip industry and minimise reliance on foreign suppliers began to take shape as Wu spearheaded Arm China's rapid growth.</p> <p>A power struggle at Arm China came to a head in 2020 after the pugnacious chief was ousted by its board in a 7-1 vote due to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc55d4c9-1065-4db0-98a4-f7f0c1de563b\">“conflicts of interest</a>” relating to his <strong>Alphatecture </strong>investment fund. </p> <p>Wu refused to leave, and to this day remains Arm China's legal representative, making it difficult to force him out under a centuries-old Chinese system.</p> <p>The spat <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49889c43-70b8-45d7-b0b0-44e98d3bf89f\">presented a huge obstacle</a> in Nvidia's attempt to buy Arm, and it still hasn't gone away. </p> <p>Our colleagues have now revealed that Wu <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8494d5f3-4f3e-4a1d-878d-cabb82e37778?\">launched yet another legal case</a> against Arm China through one of his shareholder companies, according to a court filing obtained by the FT. This could disrupt Son's hopes of a listing in New York.</p> <p>The “management turmoil” at Arm's Chinese division “needs to get resolved” for Son's plans to be realised,<strong> Inder Singh</strong>, Arm's chief financial officer, said on Tuesday. “Even if we weren't doing an IPO that would still be something we would be focused on.”</p> <h2>The race to buy Peloton kicks into gear&#xa0;</h2> <p>When an ageing “Mr Big” <strong>Peloton</strong>-ed to his death on the <em>Sex and the City</em> reboot, preventive cardiologist and member of Peloton's health and wellness advisory council<strong> Suzanne Steinbaum</strong> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-12-09/sex-and-the-city-and-just-like-that-hbo-death-peloton\">chalked it up</a> to an “extravagant lifestyle” full of “cocktails, cigars, and big steaks”.</p> <p>At-home riders clipping in to their bikes for their favourite classes were less than comforted.</p> <p>A peloton (pun intended) of potential buyers, however, think they've got the endurance to ride out the fitness group's tumultuous share price. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/297e4161-2243-49c5-b6c0-6a054a20c17f\"><strong>Amazon</strong> and<strong> Nike</strong></a> are among the strongest suitors, according to people briefed on the moves. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/998c4512-0f12-4bb5-95da-1ca685915fda\">searing 65-page presentation</a> sent earlier this week to Peloton's board, activist investor<strong> Blackwells Capital</strong> suggested 19 potential acquirers for the home fitness company, in addition to demanding an overhaul of directors and an investigation into possible misconduct.</p> <p>Peloton's co-founder <strong>John Foley </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33c8306c-abad-41f6-874f-e95bb23c6460\">stepped down</a> as chief executive hours later to instead become executive chair.</p> <p>Both Nike and Amazon have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/297e4161-2243-49c5-b6c0-6a054a20c17f\">expressed ambitions</a> to enter the world of connected fitness, and could easily swallow Peloton's $12bn market capitalisation.</p> <p>But Foley appears resistant to a sale, and he still retains veto power over any potential deal given the company's dual-class voting structure.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mike Wells</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78a5b3e8-7dd6-4c5f-9c14-a0dd447a30ba\">is stepping down</a> as chief executive of <strong>Prudential </strong>after seven years at the helm of the UK's biggest listed insurance company. Finance director<strong> Mark FitzPatrick </strong>will become interim chief executive.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Krispy Kreme</strong>, the doughnut franchise owned by<strong> JAB Holding</strong>, has appointed<strong> Marissa Andrada</strong> to its board of directors. She currently serves as chief diversity, inclusion and people officer for <strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>US landlord <strong>Hines </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adc78bdf-4943-4539-a8eb-4fceb2648e95\">has appointed</a> its founder's granddaughter<strong> Laura Hines-Pierce</strong> as co-chief executive.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nomura</strong> has appointed <strong>Stewart Robinson</strong> as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa debt advisory, based in London. He joins from <strong>Cantor Fitzgerald</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Billionaires beware </strong>“Enforced disappearances”, as the UN calls them, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/massive-china-port-shutdown-raises-fears-of-closures-worldwide?sref=OziMsGoK\">have multiplied tenfold</a> in China since Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago.
