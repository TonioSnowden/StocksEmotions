  "text": "<p>Few sports provide more Pinterest inspiration than tennis. Google \"Arthur Ashe polo shirt\" or \"Chris Evert hair bow\" and, I promise, you won't be disappointed. One image that I always return to is this 1988 shot of Princess Diana and Steffi Graf having an enigmatic moment at the net. Diana is wearing a long cardigan that nearly covers her pleated miniskirt with white puffy trainers—an outfit that aligns with fashion's current obsessions with both vintage and preppy style. Last week, as part of their ongoing collaboration, Reebok and Masion Margiela launched an eerily similar sneaker. While you might want a little more ankle support for actual on-court play, this court-adjacent style will nicely tone down the exuberance of your \"it's finally spring\" floral dress, or style up your tried-and-true Lululemon ensemble.

With its famous red strip rising from the back of the sole, it was one of the late-1990s' and early-aughts' most covetable and subtle status symbols. Like all things of that era, this shoe shape is back in fashion. The AC could easily have inspired a similarly soled shoe that the Row is offering this spring, and a sporty-soled boot in Proenza Schouler's recent Fall 2022 show also gave off '90s Prada vibes. Not to be forgotten, the original has returned with a technological twist. Prada's website now lets you fully customize the reborn AC, letting you choose from 10 colors and two materials (traditional leather or patent) and have your initials monogrammed on the heel, much as sneakerheads can with the Nike I.D. So if you regret having sold your original pair on the RealReal six years ago and have $1,100 to spare, this relaunch might erase any remorse.

After expanding into dresses and ballerina flats over the past few years, the brand's designers are launching their first (affordable, naturally) sneaker in collaboration with French athletic shoe brand Veja this week. Combining Veja's popular flat-soled, minimalist Campo style with four signature Mansur Gavriel pastel shades, the sneakers are fully candy-coated from soles to laces. The saturated colors tend to read more Crayola than Kandinsky when shown as a group, but, individually, the pop of pink or blue of these sleek sneaks can nicely balance a closet of too-sober-for-spring black workday garb. Welcome to your new hybrid-work uniform. $175, MansurGavriel.com and Veja-Store.com</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
