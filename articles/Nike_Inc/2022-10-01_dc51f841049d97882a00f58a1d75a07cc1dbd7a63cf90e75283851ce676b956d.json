  "text": "<p>\n  AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC. </p><p>\n  AAL +3.5% </p><p>\n  Could a new partnership between two rival carriers be grounded? An antitrust trial that took flight Tuesday will determine the fate of the Northeast Alliance, which made American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. partners at three New York area airports and in Boston. They agreed to sell seats on one another's flights along certain routes, pool airport slots, coordinate schedules and share some revenue. The government alleges the pact will bring higher fares, while carriers say working together makes them stronger rivals. American Airlines shares rose 3.5% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  AMAZON.COM INC. </p><p>\n  AMZN +1.2% </p><p>\n  Amazon is getting primed for the holidays. The e-commerce retailing giant on Monday added a second Prime Day-like event to its calendar, saying its 48-hour \"Prime Early Access Sale\" will take place Oct. 11-12 for members of its Prime subscription program. The new event will offer deals at a time when shoppers are being squeezed by inflation, and could help Amazon boost its revenue in the all-important fourth quarter. Amazon already offers its Prime members a similar shopping extravaganza in July, on its annual Prime Day. Amazon shares rose 1.2% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NIKE INC. </p><p>\n  NKE -13% </p><p>\n  Nike is stepping up its discounts. The sneaker giant will mark down more goods heading into the holidays after reporting a 44% jump in inventories in the latest quarter. It is the latest sign of how rapidly retailers and manufacturers found themselves with a surplus of goods after two years of scrambling to have enough to sell during the pandemic. Nike shares tumbled 13% Friday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC. </p><p>\n  HTZ +4.4% </p><p>\n  A new deal with BP PLC will help Hertz get charged up. The companies said they signed a deal to develop and manage a network of electric-vehicle charging stations across North America. Hertz said that it has tens of thousands of EVs available at 500 locations across 38 states, and the car-rental company aims for one-quarter of its fleet of vehicles to be electric by the end of 2024. BP's EV charging business would power Hertz's charging infrastructure, which will be open to taxi and ride-sharing drivers, as well as the general public. Hertz shares rose 4.4% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  BIOGEN INC. </p><p>\n  BIIB +40% </p><p>\n  Biogen got a shot in the arm from the recent success of an experimental Alzheimer drug. The company and its partner, Japanese pharmaceutical firm Eisai Co., said the drug lecanemab significantly slowed the disease's progression in a large study, bolstering its prospects for approval. An estimated six million people in the U.S. suffer from Alzheimer's. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is already reviewing whether to grant conditional early approval to lecanemab. Eisai shares jumped in Tokyo trading, and shares of Biogen surged 40% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC. </p><p>\n  PTON -14% </p><p>\n  Peloton has a new place to peddle its bikes. Peloton will begin selling its exercise equipment at Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. stores, marking the first time that the fitness gear company will sell its items at a physical store outside of the company's own showrooms. Once a pandemic darling, the struggling company is expanding its reach into bricks-and-mortar stores amid a drop in demand as people return to the gym. Peloton also in August said it would start selling its fitness equipment and apparel on Amazon.com Inc. Peloton shares plunged 14% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  CARMAX INC. </p><p>\n  KMX -25% </p><p>\n  Demand for used cars has hit a speed bump: inflation. CarMax saw profit drop by more than 50% in its second quarter, as higher prices and economic concerns slowed the appetite for preowned cars and trucks. Used-car sellers did well during the pandemic amid a shortage of new vehicles, but higher prices pushed budget-conscious shoppers out of the car market. Finance chief Enrique Mayor-Mora said the company has cut costs, including reducing staff through attrition, to align with sales. CarMax shares plummeted 25% Thursday. </p><p></p>",
