  "title": "Diesel's Glenn Martens: ‘It's about pleasing myself to please the world'",
  "text": "<p>At the haute couture shows in January, Glenn Martens stepped outside his day jobs as creative director of Diesel and avant-garde label Y/Project and became the second guest designer to create a couture collection for Jean Paul Gaultier.</p> <p>What he created was sensational, anarchic and glamorous, underlining his rare ability to move across the avant-garde, the extravagant and the everyday. Satin dresses with architectural internal wiring had fantastical silhouettes that billowed around the models' bodies as if a Disney fairy godmother had sent them out on to the runway. Garments studded with fake coral looked like they would injure anyone who came too close. </p> <p>“Doing couture was a dream,” Martens, 38, says, talking from his home in Paris. “There was no budget limitation, which really affects the design process. It was about pleasing myself to please the world.”</p> <p>A designer with a once niche following, Martens' profile rose considerably when he was hired as creative director of Diesel in October 2020. One of the strengths of Y/Project — where he's been creative director since 2013 — is deconstructed denim, and so in one way Martens' appointment was a natural choice; but it was also surprising given that, by his own admission, he is not a commercially minded designer. </p> <p>“I'm a very bad creative director, according to the CEOs I work for, because I won't put logos on garments,” he says. “We all know that luxury brands are selling sweatshirts that cost €70 for €700 by putting branding on them. That's not for me, and it's not taking your customer seriously.”</p> <p>For Diesel owner Renzo Rosso to hand the label to Martens was thus both an act of faith and a sign that he wanted to create serious change. Diesel is the largest part of Rosso's Only the Brave group, which reported revenues of €1.53bn in 2021. The brand has struggled over the past decade, becoming lossmaking in 2016 and later filing for US bankruptcy protection, though it has been profitable since 2019, the same year former Balmain chief executive Massimo Piombini was hired to lead the brand.</p> <p>Since taking the reins, Piombini has sought to reboot Diesel as a dynamic 2020s brand. “My competitors aren't Levi's or Balenciaga,” he told <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/a-fresh-start-for-diesel\">Vogue Business</a> in 2020. “My competitors are the gym, Netflix. Diesel has to be a part of your life.” </p> <p>Martens' first official collection for Diesel, for spring 2022, was unveiled last June and featured playful pieces such as baggy jeans that become boots at the hem, jersey coats, trousers and shirts printed to look like denim, and pink cropped jackets that offered a tongue-in-cheek twist on a more prim, ladylike style. But his work does not begin and end on the runway.</p> <p>“The first thing I did was refit all the denim,” Martens says. “I needed to make sure there was more diversity in cuts for a wider range of customers. I also installed the Diesel Library, changing the supply chain. There's a QR code on each of the Diesel Library pieces that offers transparency of production. And the conceptual runway pieces are all made using deadstock denim.” The classic Diesel motto of “for successful living” is now about living with less, for longer.</p> <p>The Diesel Library collection uses partly recycled fabrics — but it's a start. And there's a holistic approach to production, with washes and treatments that minimise the use of water and chemicals. Martens' hope is that the styles will be long-lasting, so customers won't feel the need to update or replace their jeans. But, of course, fashion depends on the desire for the new. </p> <p>Martens hasn't only touched the denim. “Just before Christmas, I discovered we had a licensee for sex toys,” he says, laughing. “They came in and I had to give input on that. It's fun to jump from one product to a totally different one.”</p> <p>The often contorted, supersized element of the menswear and womenswear that Martens shows together isn't passive; it can take confidence and imagination to wear. Often there's not just one obvious way to put the garments on. Shirts frequently come with more than one layer of collar and multiple sets of buttons, and trousers with a wide V-shaped opening at the front, with a tied fastening, creating an effect that is elongating and flattering.</p> <p>The independently owned brand, run by a team of 25 in Paris, doesn't release its sales figures and is clearly a niche business. But it has become gradually more commercial&#xa0;since it launched in 2010, partly because of the public's taste catching up with Martens' radical vision, but also because of Martens embracing a more subtle version of “radical” — a faux-leather bomber jacket in the current collection is accented by his typical giant pockets and oversized shoulder line, but it's not intimidating. “It has definitely become more popular with our customers,” says Ida Petersson, buying director for Browns. “Martens has conquered a perfect balance between conceptual craftsmanship and wearability.”</p> <p>In 2020, Y/Project launched <a href=\"https://www.yproject.fr/shop/evergreen\">Evergreen</a>, a seasonless collection of past designs, currently including the asymmetric, sculptural twisted-lapel blazer and denim shirts with multiple panels that attach with snap fasteners. The latest show represented a dialogue with Gaultier — in the same season that Martens was creating couture, Y/Project paid homage to the veteran designer's classic <em>trompe l'oeil</em> prints of naked bodies on garments.</p> <p>“I started with one of his iconic prints from the 1990s,” Martens said. “We've done a lot of collaborations, and it's always good to make something a statement that comes from our perspective. Not everything works, though — we did a collaboration with Fila, which was good for PR and brought some street credibility and celebrated the history of an important brand, but it wasn't a commercial success. People aren't going to spend €800 on sweatpants.”</p> <p>Despite Martens' insistence on being anti-logo, Diesel under Piombini's direction still needs branding, albeit in a more low-key way than Nike, Gucci or indeed Balenciaga. </p> <p>“We're doing it, although we don't show it on the conceptual runway pieces we are making,” Martens says. “We have done knitwear, and the logo is printed on the inside. Of course, the label is on the jeans. It has its place but won't dominate. I also know that not using logos at Y/Project might limit the growth of the brand but, for the sake of integrity, I say no for the moment.”</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Mark C O’Flaherty 2022 'Diesel's Glenn Martens: ‘It's about pleasing myself to please the world'' FT.com 23 February.
