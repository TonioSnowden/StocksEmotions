  "title": "Roblox Stock Drops After Earnings  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Shares of Roblox Corp. fell more than 25% Wednesday after the company released earnings Tuesday that came in below Wall Street analysts' expectations and added to investors' concerns about its ability to expand its users as the pandemic fades. </p><p>   Roblox said fourth-quarter bookings and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased from a year earlier. But those figures fell short of what many analysts had forecast. </p><p>   Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie said that weekend usage remains strong despite a drop in weekday engagement because of easing social-distancing restrictions. </p><p>   \"That gives us confidence to say that it will -- we believe that we will be returning to high rates of growth,\" he said on a conference call Wednesday morning. </p><p>   Mr. Guthrie also reminded analysts that the past nearly two years have been an anomaly with regard to user engagement due to the pandemic. </p><p>   \"It's just the daily activity is coming down because, again, people are back to school, back to work,\" he said. \"It's incredibly difficult to compare with a period where everything was shut down. We've just never seen anything like that in our history.\" </p><p>   Shares of Roblox -- which operates a free online platform for playing games, socializing and attending concerts virtually -- fell 27% to close at $53.87 Wednesday, their lowest close since listing last year and their biggest one-day decline. However, the company is still at a price above the $45 reference from when it went public in a direct listing in March 2021. </p><p>   The stock rose so much last year on high expectations that the company \"shouldn't miss growth estimates,\" said Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey. </p><p>   Roblox also reported declines in daily users and hours engaged in the U.S. and Canada, its core markets. \"This shouldn't happen in a holiday quarter,\" Mr. Hickey said. </p><p>   The San Mateo, Calif.-based company said that average spending per daily user was down in January from a year ago. </p><p>   \"Once stuck-inside kids and teens are now spending weekdays off their devices and out in the real world,\" Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. </p><p>   All of the experiences on Roblox are made by its own users, including a growing number of mainstream brands such as Nike, Gucci and Mattel. The company makes money by selling virtual currency called Robux to users who can spend it on various perks such as accessories for their avatars. </p><p>   Roblox lately has been attracting new users who are older than its traditional core demographic of children under 13 years old, Roblox executives said on the earnings call, adding that the company expects more international growth in the years ahead. They said Roblox has been adding new features to boost engagement, such as voice communication, and joining with more brands and artists to develop experiences on its platform. </p><p>   The company's earnings report also showed that expenses such as personnel costs and developer exchange fees rose in the fourth quarter from both the prior quarter and a year earlier. </p><p>   In an interview ahead of the earnings report, Roblox Chief Executive David Baszucki addressed the common problem faced by platforms with user-generated content in identifying and removing rule-breakers. He said media reports about sexual and other prohibited content appearing on Roblox are exaggerated. </p><p>   \"I feel our platform is evolving in a safe and civil direction and making progress much more quickly than we are growing actually,\" he said. \"So I see these outliers being relatively more rare.\" </p><p></p>",
