  "title": "Kentucky's John Calipari Breaks His Dependence on Freshmen",
  "text": "<p>In an unusual turn for Kentucky, which normally boasts one of the youngest teams in the NCAA, the average age on this year's roster is above the legal drinking limit. The best player is a junior, Oscar Tshiebwe. And for the first time in Calipari's 13 seasons in Lexington, Ky., there are more upperclassmen than freshmen.</p><p>\"We knew we had to change the roster,\" Calipari said this week. He's come to realize that many teenagers have outsized views of their abilities. He said they think, \"I did it at the Nike Camp, why can't I do it here?\"</p><p>The Wildcats' veteran core is a big reason why they have a 25-6 record in the surprisingly deep Southeastern Conference, with a good shot at making a run in the NCAA tournament. Kentucky will finish its regular season at Florida on Saturday.</p><p>\"I think it's been fun for us to coach a team with experience,\" assistant coach Chin Coleman said. \"We have a really good balance in our class structure.\"</p><p>Calipari added that the more grounded perspectives of his older players help keep younger egos in check. \"These kids went through everything. They're not delusional about anything.\"</p><p>After arriving in 2009, Calipari cemented Kentucky's blue blood status with a novel model for roster building that was made possible by an NBA rule change. Beginning with the 2006 draft, the league raised the minimum age to 19, effectively requiring the most talented high-schoolers to enroll in at least one year of college before going pro.</p><p>\"I've coached older teams before,\" Calipari insisted. \"It just hasn't been in the last 13 years because of the rule changes and the way everything was going.\"</p><p>Kentucky aggressively went after the brightest high-school stars. It was a bet that talent would outweigh team chemistry, as he strategy sacrificed roster continuity for star power.</p><p>\"I'm taking talent. I've said that from day one,\" Calipari said.</p><p>It usually worked: Kentucky advanced to four Final Fours over five seasons, won it all in 2012 with a freshman named Anthony Davis and lost in the title game in 2014.</p><p>During the 2014-15 season, then-freshmen Devin Booker and Karl-Anthony Towns helped Kentucky become the 19th college basketball team ever to go undefeated in the regular season. The Wildcats lost in the Final Four to Wisconsin that year.</p><p>After that season, Calipari doubled down on one-and-done players. Prior to 2014-15, he recruited between four and six freshmen in all but one season.</p><p>After 2015, Calipari signed no less than seven freshmen in each of the following six seasons. It was another notable shift toward youth in a program in a sport with just 13 scholarships to divvy up.</p><p>The youth movement has so far yielded mixed results. Kentucky has had more NBA draft picks (24) and lottery picks (12) than any otherschool since 2015, but the Wildcats have advanced no further than the Elite Eight round of March Madness. Things got downright miserable last season, as Kentucky limped along to a 9-16 finish and missed the NCAA tournament altogether.</p><p>That team had eight freshmen, five sophomores and three upperclassmen. Thanks to the NBA draft, the transfer portal and tragedy -- 19-year-old Terrence Clarke died in a car accident last April -- Calipari overhauled his team with an eye toward experience.</p><p>The 2021-22 Wildcats have nine upperclassmen; Calipari has never coached more than five in a season before at Kentucky. There's a six-year age gap between Kellan Grady, the 24-year-old grad student, and freshman Shaedon Sharp, who is 18.</p><p>Most of these veterans weren't originally recruited by Kentucky. Only three of the team's seven juniors started their careers with the Wildcats; The other four trickled in via the transfer portal between the summer of 2019 and last fall, including Tshiebwe. Some of those players know the benefits of having played alongside the same group of players for several years.</p><p>\"When you're rallying with somebody, that guy beside you has probably been your roommate for three years already. . . . I've probably had lunch, met this guy's family, been with them for three years and we've eaten over 100 times together,\" said Davion Mintz, a grad transfer who came to Kentucky from Creighton and is using the extra year of eligibility the NCAA granted all athletes during the pandemic to play another year. At Kentucky, he added, \"It's completely different.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Mintz said this season's team is the closest he's been on in his 23 years. The players spend nearly all of their free time together, aided by the fact that they all live in Kentucky's \"Wildcat Coal Lodge,\" a luxe dorm built exclusively for the men's basketball team.</p><p>\"Coach Cal is the master,\" Coleman said. \"Let's be clear: He's won at a high level in college basketball with having turnover every year and bringing in new guys every year.\"</p><p>Calipari wouldn't say that winning it all with talented 18-year-olds is impossible, but he didn't argue with the fact that experience helps.</p><p>\"If you can get both, that's what you want,\" Calipari said. \"And we have that.\"</p>",
