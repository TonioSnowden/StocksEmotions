  "title": "Michael Avenatti Found Guilty of Stealing From Stormy Daniels; Jury convicts lawyer of stealing nearly $300,000 from his former client",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Avenatti clasped his hands and looked at the jury while U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman read the verdict. Afterward he looked down and closed his eyes. Judge Furman set a sentencing date for May 24. He also ordered Mr. Avenatti to report to prison in California on Monday to begin serving his sentence in a separate federal conviction.</p><p>Outside the courtroom, Mr. Avenatti expressed disappointment in the jury's verdict. \"I am looking forward to a full adjudication of all of the issues on appeal,\" he said.</p><p>When asked if he regretted representing himself, he said, \"No, not at all.\"</p><p>After the verdict, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, \"Rather than advise his clients in their best interests, Avenatti instead used his law degree as a license to steal.\"</p><p>Clark Brewster, a lawyer for Ms. Daniels, said his client was pleased the justice system worked. \"Stormy is relieved this nightmare is over,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>It is the second federal criminal conviction of Mr. Avenatti, the brash television lawyer whose ascent to stardom was tied to his quest to take down former President Donald Trump. In addition to representing Ms. Daniels in her legal battles against the former president, he publicly contemplated a 2020 presidential run.</p><p>His rise abruptly ended in 2019, when he was indicted in connection with what federal prosecutors said was an attempt to extort more than $20 million from Nike Inc. After a trial in 2020, Mr. Avenatti was convicted of three criminal counts and sentenced to 2 Â½ years in prison. He has appealed that conviction. Last year, in California, he represented himself in a second federal trial that ended in a mistrial.</p><p>In the latest case, Manhattan federal prosecutors accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing a portion of the advance for Ms. Daniels' memoir, \"Full Disclosure,\" then lying to his onetime client to cover it up. Prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti sent a fake letter from Ms. Daniels to her literary agent. The letter instructed that book payments be sent to an account controlled by Mr. Avenatti.</p><p>\"He was supposed to be her advocate, but the defendant betrayed her trust,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman said during closing arguments.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti portrayed the dispute as an argument over fees. \"According to the government, Michael Avenatti could never believe that he actually had a right to be paid,\" Mr. Avenatti told the jury. \"That is ludicrous.\"</p><p>Ms. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, served as prosecutors' star witness.</p><p>Prosecutors presented as evidence numerous messages between her and Mr. Avenatti, in which he repeatedly said he didn't know what had happened to her money and was trying to get it back.</p><p>During cross-examination, Mr. Avenatti tried to undermine Ms. Daniels' credibility by asking about her paranormal beliefs and her work on the show she founded, \"Spooky Babes.\" Ms. Daniels testified that she could speak with dead people, haunted houses and a doll named Susan.</p><p>\"You refer to yourself having the ability to be put in a trance and then run around and solve crimes, right?\" Mr. Avenatti asked.</p><p>\"All in the show, yes,\" Ms. Daniels replied.</p><p>\"Are you actually able to do that?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Michael Avenatti Found Guilty of Stealing From Stormy Daniels</p>",
