  "text": "<p>Nike Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. said Thursday they are leaving Russia, months after both companies paused operations in the country because of the war against Ukraine.</p><p>\"Nike has made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace,\" a Nike spokeswoman said in a statement. \"Our priority is to ensure we are fully supporting our employees while we responsibly scale down our operations over the coming months.\"</p><p>Cisco said it would support employees in Russia and Belarus through the transition as it shuts down operations. The computer networking and online security company said it would channel resources toward helping its employees and Ukrainians.</p><p>\"At Cisco, we strongly and unequivocally condemn the unjustified war, and the violence that has been unleashed upon innocent civilians,\" the company said.</p><p>Hundreds of businesses have pledged to exit or cut back operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The war has prompted a wave of Western sanctions. Global companieshave incurred more than $59 billion in losses from their Russian operations.</p><p>McDonald's Corp. last month said it would leave Russia and sell its operations there, ending more than three decades in the country. Starbucks Corp. as of last month was also closing operations in Russia and Volkswagen AG stopped production at its car plants in the country.</p><p>As of March, Nike operated about 116 stores in Russia. The company said it had stopped taking orders on its Russian website earlier this year because it couldn't guarantee delivery.</p><p>Nike's business in Russia and Ukraine represents less than 1% of the retailer's total revenue, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in March.</p><p>Cisco's business in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine has historically accounted for about 1% of its revenue, Chief Financial Officer R. Scott Herren said on the company's earnings call in May. Pausing operations in Russia and Belarus in March dinged quarterly revenue by about $200 million, he said.</p><p>While many companies have opted to leave Russia, doing so isn't necessarily easy. Cigarette company Philip Morris International Inc., for example, has been trying to sell its Russian business but the process has taken months.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com and Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Nike, Cisco are Leaving Russia</p>",
