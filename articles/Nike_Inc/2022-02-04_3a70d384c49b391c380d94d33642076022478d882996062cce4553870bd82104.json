  "title": "Nike Accuses StockX of Trademark Infringement in Sales of NFTs; The online resale marketplace offers customers the chance to buy digital tokens associated with limited-edition sneakers",
  "text": "<p>Nike said the sale of NFTs based on recently released iterations of sneakers such as Nike Dunks and Air Jordans \"are likely to confuse consumers, create a false association between those products and Nike\" and dilute its trademarks, according to the suit. NFTs act as vouchers of authenticity on the blockchain for goods.</p><p>A StockX representative declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Detroit-based company, founded in 2016 as a resale platform for coveted sneakers, was valued at $3.8 billion after a funding round last year.</p><p>The NFT market has exploded in the past year, with trading volume in 2021 surpassing $23 billion, according to digital-analytics firm DappRadar. Companies and organizations such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the National Basketball Association and Gucci have all entered the space.</p><p>StockX in mid-January began selling NFTs tied to limited-edition designs held in its storage facility.</p><p>The NFTs were minted, or created, in quantities between one and 250 for each physical sneaker.</p><p>Customers who buy the StockX NFTs have the option of being shipped the physical sneaker, which would take that NFT out of circulation, or keeping the digital asset on the blockchain, which enables it to be resold on StockX's platform.</p><p>In recent days, NFTs of the Air Jordan 4 and the Nike Dunk Low have resold for over $500 on the site, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal of data on StockX, more than double the retail price of the physical shoes. StockX charges customers who sell an NFT on its platform a 3% transaction fee in addition to a 1% payment processing fee. On its website, StockX markets the digital goods as authentic products and exclusive NFTs.</p><p>Nike claimed that StockX has sold over 500 NFTs depicting its sneakers, according to the suit. It is seeking a court order stopping StockX from selling NFTs based on its products as well as damages.</p><p>The lawsuit comes less than two months after Nike acquired Rtfkt (pronounced artifact), a virtual sneaker company that produces NFT collectibles, for an undisclosed sum. Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe said the purchase would help \"extend Nike's digital footprint and capabilities.\" Nike has thus far not released any authorized NFTs.</p><p>Luxury brand Herm√®s International S.C.A. last month alleged that the artist behind MetaBirkins NFTs, a collection of 100 virtual depictions of fur-covered Birkin handbags, had violated its trademark. Some of the tokens had fetched tens of thousands of dollars before being removed from OpenSea, a NFT trading platform.</p><p>\"I am not creating or selling fake Birkin bags. I've made art works that depict imaginary, fur-covered Birkin bags,\" said artist Mason Rothschild. \"The First Amendment gives me the right to make and sell art that depicts Birkin bags, just as it gave Andy Warhol the right to make and sell art depicting Campbell's soup cans.\"</p><p>The lawsuit is pending in New York federal court.</p><p>Legal opinions vary on how judges will rule in these trademark disputes. Douglas Hand, a New York lawyer who works with fashion and lifestyle brands and isn't involved in either case, said the outcome of these NFT lawsuits will involve whether \"the consumer believes that there is an association between what they're purchasing and the brand.\"</p><p>The StockX NFTs differ from Mr. Rothschild's creations in that the platform holds the physical goods that correspond to each NFT, which Mr. Hand said may provide some legal cover.</p><p>Jared Goldstein, a New York lawyer and co-author of a book about the sneaker business, said current protections under copyright and trademark rules may not extend to StockX. Mr. Goldstein, who isn't involved in the StockX case, said the first-sale doctrine allows the site to resell sneakers without obtaining permission from the copyright holder, but that doctrine may not apply to creating and selling NFTs of that product.</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at Jacob.Gallagher@wsj.com and Charity L.
