  "text": "<p>\"They say you get back an hour per day,\" he said in French, with California still on his mind. \"So I've got a few more days of suffering ahead of me.\"</p><p>Mbappé would recover just in time to pile on more jet lag, seven time zones away on a promotional tour of Japan. By the time it was over, he'd have to launch headfirst into a European soccer season with a World Cup crammed into the middle of it. There are no breaks for the player who made his pro debut at 16, racked up five French championships and is already a world champion. But after a decade defined by two all-time greats—his boyhood idol Cristiano Ronaldo and his current teammate Lionel Messi, now 37 and 35—he is right on the trajectory he's designed for himself. Mbappé is their natural heir.</p><p>What sets him apart is that he understands innately something that Messi and Ronaldo had to learn on the fly: In order to be a global icon in the world's most popular sport in 2022, it's no longer enough just to play that sport. You must play it brilliantly, virally, and embrace everything that comes alongside it—a permanent reinvestment in your own image.</p><p>\"It's as if he was born to be where he is today,\" says Arsène Wenger, the former Arsenal manager and dean of French soccer coaches. \"The question about him now isn't 'Is he the best?' It's 'How far can this kid go?' We forget his age—and yet, everyone knows who he is.\"</p><p>Mbappé has 27 million more Instagram followers than two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry and 60 million more than Tom Brady. He has accessed a level of global celebrity that tends to come only through soccer, the White House or having the last name Kardashian. That's how a video of Mbappé draining baskets on a Pop-a-Shot machine in Brooklyn can draw nearly six million views in a matter of days. But it's all part of Mbappé's larger plan, the one he's been working on since he first kicked a ball in a concrete suburb north of Paris. Even at 23, he isn't shy about precisely what he's trying to do here.</p><p>\"I've always wanted people to remember my name,\" Mbappé says. \"That was a personal ambition. I've always wanted to write my name in soccer history.\"</p><p>In soccer there are prospects, there are can't-miss prospects, and then there is Kylian Mbappé. The same way anyone in the business of knowing these things was aware of LeBron James when he was in middle school, Mbappé's first dot on the soccer radar appeared when he was still learning arithmetic.</p><p>Playing in the local club where his father, Wilfrid Mbappé Lottin, happened to be a youth coach, Kylian generated enough attention with his touch, speed and movement that Nike began sending him cleats when he was 10 years old. When the company offered him a formal endorsement deal, Mbappé was 14, with lightning pace and a killer instinct for scoring. By then, he'd been spotted by the French national training center and was appearing in magazine spreads, chilling out in his bedroom, the walls plastered with photos of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>\"He's clearly the successor,\" says Wenger, who was on the long list of people who tried to sign Mbappé at 16. \"But he also combines their qualities. He's a goal scorer and a creator. He's a finisher and a passer…. He's not just expressing his talent—he also creates the unexpected.\"</p><p>It was only natural for every major club in Europe to keep tabs on him. In a sign of courtships to come, at one point Real Madrid flew him over to play with a youth team. But that only lasted a week. The club that took on the responsibility of shaping him into a pro was AS Monaco, perched on a cliffside on the French Riviera.</p><p>\"I was in the public eye very, very young. And I was considered to be very talented,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"So there's always been a lot of goodwill around me. People wanted to help.\"</p><p>Mbappé calls those people his cocoon. And the most important people in it are his parents. Mbappé Lottin, who emigrated to France from Cameroon as a child, and also played for the local club in the Parisian suburb of Bondy, handles most of the soccer matters. Mbappé's mother, Fayza Lamari, the daughter of Algerian immigrants and a former serious handball player, is in charge of managing Kylian's image. There is a coterie of lawyers and assorted helpers in the cocoon too, but ultimately it's always been Kylian, Fayza and Wilfrid, navigating a world that nothing had prepared them for.</p><p>\"I was protected, and it grew slowly, in a crescendo,\" he says. \"I wasn't a star at 14 years old.\"</p><p>Yet it seems he's been bracing for celebrity from a young age. Beyond his native French, Mbappé chats easily in English and Spanish. Occasionally, he lapses into press-conference-speak with answers that attest to his maturity, while carefully dancing around any material revelations. He doesn't talk about romantic relationships, nor is he ever photographed with a partner on red carpets. When I ask what he's learned from early stardom—and any mistakes he's made along the way—he keeps it deliberately vague. \"I feel much better prepared for all eventualities, positive or negative,\" he says. That's the media-trained Mbappé.</p><p>The on-pitch Mbappé is much less guarded. He struts around freely in the knowledge of just how otherworldly his talent is. He plays to the crowd with a trademark goal celebration—arms crossed and hands wedged into his armpits—and fans see it a lot: Mbappé has been the French league's top goalscorer in each of the past four seasons. But when things don't go well, his dissatisfaction with teammates who don't live up to his standards—or pass him the ball when he wants it—is plain to read on his face.</p><p>Mbappé can't help it. As with all super-elite athletes, the thing that makes them fume on the field is the same thing that got them on the field in the first place: a snarling, almost pathological competitive streak. Mbappé not only has it, he hones it all the time. That's why, he says, he cannot give an inch—even if it makes him a nightmare to play cards against.</p><p>\"There are people who want to have fun and just enjoy things—and I respect that view,\" he explains, also dismissing that view. \"But I chose this life wanting to win and wanting to be competitive…. You don't just announce, 'I want to win' and sit on your couch every day. Every day, you work on it, you increase that appetite to win in everything you do.\"</p><p>It helps when the results tell you it's working, too. In the 24 months that elapsed between Mbappé's 18th and 20th birthdays, two things happened that bumped his status up from crackling talent of the future to one of the most important players of his generation. The first was a move from Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2017. The deal, which saw PSG pay around $185 million to Monaco for Mbappé's rights, made him soccer's most expensive teenager at the time. The second came on a rain-soaked summer evening in Moscow. That's where Kylian Mbappé won the World Cup.</p><p>Over one dizzying month in Russia in the summer of 2018, he electrified the tournament with his speed and delivered his signature match in the round of 16, when he scored twice to eliminate Messi's Argentina. The previous teenager to score twice in a World Cup knockout game was a Brazilian kid named Pelé. Mbappé grabbed another goal in the final and found himself hoisting the trophy alongside French president Emmanuel Macron, who kissed him on the forehead during the presentation.</p><p>When he returned as a newly minted world champion, his place in soccer's firmament had shifted. \"The more famous you get, the more people want to know about you,\" Mbappé says. \"They want to know which pajamas you sleep in, where you live, how you spend your time. That border is getting thinner all the time. Mine hangs by a thread. But that's the way it is. I knew what I was getting into.\"</p><p>Or at least, he knew what he wanted to live up to. As an impressionable kid, Mbappé saw Messi and Ronaldo—players who redefined greatness through their primes at Barcelona and Real Madrid and took the business of being a celebrity soccer player to unprecedented heights—everywhere he looked. They built massive commercial edifices on foundations laid by Michael Jordan and later David Beckham to become arguably two of the most recognizable people on the planet. If that was now part of building a soccer legacy, then that's what Mbappé needed to study.</p><p>\"I don't think you can copy and paste their careers to make history,\" he says.</p><p>Instead, Mbappé is blending them. He has the ferocious athleticism of Ronaldo in his prime and a pace that has been clocked at more than 23 miles per hour. But he has the on-field vision and good-boy image of Messi. And in one respect at least, he's already ahead of both: Mbappé is a World Cup winner. Messi and Ronaldo are not.</p><p>\"They changed the way people approach the game,\" Mbappé says. \"I think that's why their rivalry obsessed so many people. They don't see soccer the same way. They don't see life the same way. And they went at it tooth and nail for more than a decade—for me, that was my entire childhood.\"</p><p>What he could not have anticipated was ending up on a team quite like PSG is today. Even at a time when clubs are owned by international billionaires, the project Mbappé signed up for is unique. That's because at Paris Saint-Germain, soccer is just one of the products on offer.</p><p>Unlike many of Europe's most powerful clubs, PSG wasn't started by a clutch of 19th-century factory workers or schoolboys or railwaymen, as were the ancient teams of England or Spain or the rest of France. It was founded by a group of Parisian businessmen in 1970 in the tony 16th arrondissement. Its modern history dates back to 2011, when PSG was acquired by an arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Immediately, the understanding was that the club needed to develop an entire lifestyle brand around the team.</p><p>Using the slogan \"Dream Bigger,\" the Qatari leadership sought to replicate the glitz of being courtside at an NBA game, while making PSG's Eiffel Tower logo as iconic as a Yankee cap. PSG had to look different, so they hired a fashion photographer to follow the team around for 80 days a year. They partnered with artists and designers to produce limited-edition merchandise ranging from sneakers in collaboration with the Rolling Stones to a fly-fishing tackle box aimed at the Japanese market. They also signed with Jordan Brand to create the company's only soccer jersey. To peddle all that gear, they opened team stores that look like luxury boutiques in Tokyo's Shibuya ward, on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and on Paris's Champs-Élysées, among other locations. They were selling soccer—a little bit—but really, this was a soccer club deciding that its real business was selling taste. Why?</p><p>\"Because Paris,\" says Fabien Allègre, the head of PSG's brand department. \"Without being arrogant, everything that's best in the world—in terms of architecture, design, food—is all here.\"</p><p>In that sense, the PSG version of Mbappé doesn't just stand for sporting excellence. Or a kind of global Frenchness. The forward who boasts endorsement deals with Dior, Hublot and Oakley is also there to embody luxury—a kind of exclusivity and refinement that belongs, as the club will tell you, uniquely to the French capital.</p><p>Which is why the noises out of Mbappé's camp in the summer of 2021 were enough to send the club into full-blown panic. With one year left on his contract, he had informed PSG that he wanted to leave.</p><p>Heading into the summer of 2022, Mbappé could already picture his next step. After Monaco and PSG, he would finally emulate Ronaldo and wear the white jersey of Real Madrid. The club that built its identity around the stars it dubbed Galácticos awaited Mbappé with open arms. For weeks, the Spanish sports press announced with unwavering certainty that he was very much on his way. That is, until Mbappé let Real Madrid know that he was very much not.</p><p>\"I really thought it was the best possible decision at that time,\" he says in hindsight. \"But the context today is different.\"</p><p>So was the Parisian hard sell that changed his mind. The club didn't publicly disclose the terms, but the three-year deal was widely reported to be worth around $200 million in salary and bonuses. Rumors of how much control he was promised over the team grew so persistent that Mbappé and PSG officials had to deny that he would have veto power over the roster—though his voice inside the club would certainly be heard. Finally, as the deal neared the line, the club was aided by some powerful help when Mbappé's renewal became a matter of state: He received pleas to stay from not one, but two French presidents.</p><p>Nicolas Sarkozy, a lifelong fan of PSG, rang Mbappé and asked him to stay. And Emmanuel Macron, an avowed supporter of PSG rival Olympique de Marseille, put aside his soccer allegiance in the name of national interest. The diplomacy—combined with one of the richest contracts in sports—had the desired effect.</p><p>\"It's a great day for the fans,\" club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi beamed at Mbappé's re-unveiling. \"And for France.\"</p><p>After Mbappé's announcement, 6.8 million viewers tuned in to watch his interview on France's 8 p.m. nightly news. \"It was a hard choice,\" he says. \"But it was a clear choice.\"</p><p>The PSG hype machine had already gone into overdrive when Messi joined the club in the summer of 2021. Once Mbappé committed to staying, however, everyone knew who the future belonged to. \"Kylian knows what he wants, knows where he's going and where he's taking his career,\" PSG's new manager, Christophe Galtier, told reporters. \"Automatically, that comes with its own pressure.\"</p><p>Success for the club so heavily invested in him will be defined largely in clicks, impressions and jerseys sold. Success for Mbappé is much simpler. He wants to win the Champions League, Europe's top prize, and the one trophy that has so far eluded PSG since the Qataris took ownership. Before that, there is also the World Cup this November in Qatar, where France will attempt to become the first nation to repeat as champions since Brazil in the early 1960s.</p><p>Except the tournament he'll find there will be unrecognizable to the one he left as a winner in Russia—not least because it will be contained in a country smaller than Connecticut.</p><p>\"My status in the game has changed,\" he says. \"That's the beauty of the World Cup. Every player is completely different from what they were at the previous one. A million things happen in four years in soccer.\"</p><p>Most of the good ones have already happened to Mbappé. Whether or not he wins the World Cup again, he expects to have a few more cracks at it. Mbappé won't turn 24 until two days after the final in Doha, which means he could conceivably play in three more World Cups. Four years are an eternity in soccer, but Kylian Mbappé's career could be long enough and glittering enough to constitute its own era.</p><p>As our interview draws to a close, I ask him, in a post-Messi, post-Ronaldo world, does he feel ready to be center stage for a decade or more? Mbappé exhales, then flashes the billboard smile again.</p><p>\"I don't think I have a choice,\" he says. \"The brake pedal doesn't work anymore.\"</p><p>Joshua Robinson is The Wall Street Journal's European sports reporter and the co-author of the forthcoming Messi vs. Ronaldo: One Rivalry, Two GOATs, and the Era That Remade the World's Game, to be published Nov. 1.</p><p>Kylian Mbappé, the 23-Year-Old PSG Star, Is the Future of Soccer</p>",
