  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Suez Canal Jam Blocks A Return to Old Normal",
  "text": "<p>The gigantic vessel beached in the Suez Canal caps a year of extraordinary drama for shipping. Container volumes collapsed in the first wave of the pandemic but recovered far faster and further than expected as Western consumers spent money on household goods, which are often imported from Asia, rather than travel and local services.</p><p>That helped drive a historic surge in shipping rates that has yet to unwind. The China Containerized Freight Index, an industry benchmark that has oscillated between 600 and 900 in recent years, now stands at 1864. Businesses that rely on global trade face higher costs and ship owners get more than double the money for providing their services. Fourth-quarter profits for Danish giant A.P. Moeller-Maersk, the world's largest container-shipping company, broke records, and this quarter is forecast to be even better.</p><p>The Suez jam will extend the disruptions. Around 12% of global trade flows through the canal, according to Maersk, which has nine ships directly affected. The longer it remains blocked, the more vessels will pile up on either side or take the long route around Africa. The knock-on impact on port schedules could last months. Given the tight market, supply chains will likely end up footing the bill.</p><p>For much of recent history the opposite set of conditions prevailed. Shipping benefited little from the globalization trend it facilitated as maritime trade became increasingly smooth, invisible and commoditized. Economists like to assume no cost of transport in their models and until recently this wasn't much of an exaggeration for big global companies.</p><p>Investors are assuming the post-pandemic normal, when it eventually emerges, won't be different for supply chains from the old one. While Maersk stock is close to a record high, it remains at a roughly four-year low relative to profit expectations, showing that investors see today's profitability as the exception. Share prices for many companies that rely on cheap and efficient global shipping, from Nike to Toyota, also remain close to records.</p><p>The hope for shipping -- and the risk for global supply chains -- is that the industry has learned from its long period of generating subpar returns. During the first wave of the pandemic, rates didn't collapse as expected when demand cratered because shippers held capacity back. Some see that as evidence they can also remain disciplined when economies reopen and consumer interest shifts away from coffee machines and televisions.</p><p>This scenario is by no means assured, but it is worth watching. Supply-chain bosses at big importers may not always be able to count on the same bargaining power over the shipping industry they enjoyed in recent years. The continuing period of congestion and sky-high rates is an extreme reminder of what that might feel like.</p>",
