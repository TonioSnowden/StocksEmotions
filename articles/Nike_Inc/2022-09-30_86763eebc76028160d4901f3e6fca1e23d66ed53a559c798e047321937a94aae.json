  "title": "Stocks Waver After Spending, Inflation Data; Government-bond yields eased at the end of a volatile week",
  "text": "<p>Stocks had rallied for a couple of months beginning in June, with investors hoping that inflation might cool down and the Fed might pull back on its aggressive rate increases. But inflation has remainedstubbornly high, and Fed officials soon made it clear that the rate increases weren't ending. Last week, Fed officials unveiled another supersize rate hike, the fifth rate increase this year.</p><p>The final week of the quarter saw stocks reach new lows amid volatile trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday fell into a bear market, a decline of 20% or more from a recent high. The S&amp;P 500, meanwhile, dropped below its previous 2022 closing low set in June.</p><p>Wednesday brought some relief, but only briefly. Government bond yields dropped after the Bank of England intervened to calm debt markets disturbed by a tax-cut plan, making stocks more attractive to many money managers. But shares tumbled againon Thursday, sending the S&amp;P 500 to its lowest close since November 2020.</p><p>On Friday, major indexes wavered in daily trading. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.1% in midday trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, or about 80 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 20% in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 is off 24% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped 31%.</p><p>With the central bank signaling it is committed to bring inflation under control, investors have grown fearful that its campaign of rate increases will meaningfully slow the economy.</p><p>\"In the trade-off between growth and inflation, the Fed is going to choose inflation,\" said Desmond Lawrence, senior investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \"That's what's really giving you the choppiness that we've had in the past week in particular.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is on course to fall for a third consecutive quarter, its longest such losing streak since one ending in March 2009, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>The final day of the quarter brought more evidence of the price pressures that the Fed is trying to contain. A measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy costs rose to a 4.9% year-over-year increase from 4.7% the prior month, according to the Commerce Department. A month-over-month reading also increased.</p><p>\"It's really just another indication that inflation is still broadening,\" said Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance. \"For anyone who's watching the Fed, it's ammunition for the Fed to keep hiking rates, which is certainly bearish for stocks and bonds.\"</p><p>Bond prices rose, sending yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped to 3.730% from 3.747% Thursday.</p><p>Investors said Friday's more upbeat mood could be short-lived as risks to economic growth remain high. Trading is also likely to be influenced by portfolio rebalancing among investors as the third quarter and month come to a close, according to analysts.</p><p>\"This is a bit of a relief rally from a big selloff,\" said Mr. Lawrence. \"We still have a very sober assessment though for the coming months.\"</p><p>Among individual stocks, Nike shares tumbled 12%, after the sneaker giant said inventories jumped 44%, while higher discounts and freight costs squeezed profit margins.</p><p>New data showed theeurozone's annual rate of inflation hit 10% in September as Russian action to curtail the bloc's gas supply drove energy prices higher.</p><p>European shares mostly rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index adding 1.3%.</p><p>Prices for Brent crude, the global benchmark, edged down 1.4% to $85.95.</p><p>Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region mostly fell. Benchmark indexes in Australia, Japan, South Korea and mainland China dropped between 0.6% and 1.8%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com and Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Waver After Spending, Inflation Data</p>",
