  "title": "For Serena Williams, Style Was Always Part of the Sport; The tennis star has helped to establish the next generation of athleticwear designers and build a bridge between couture and the court",
  "text": "<p>For Ms. Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, the tennis court wasn't only a site of competition but a soapbox of sorts, where, taking after forerunners like Billie Jean King, she found a venue for activism and individuality. But early in Ms. Williams's career, her off-court interests, ranging from fashion and design to acting and entrepreneurship, rankled many in the tennis establishment, who questioned her commitment to a sport they knew she had the potential to not only dominate but transform.</p><p>\"Distractions,\" the 18-time Slam winner Chris Evert wrote in a 2006 open letter for Tennis Magazine, \"are tarnishing your legacy,\" referring at least in part to Ms. Williams's matriculation at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, where she studied fashion design while climbing the WTA rankings. \"I don't see how acting and designing clothes can compare with the pride of being the best tennis player in the world,\" wrote Ms. Evert, encouraging a then-25-year-old Williams to make full use of her youth and natural talents. (Ms. Evert did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>In the end, Ms. Williams didn't have to choose. But the lily-white sport of tennis, where athletes bloom early and fashion urges propriety, was often scandalized by Ms. Williams's taste for the new and iconoclastic: there was the figure-hugging Puma catsuit, paired with Harry Winston jewels, she wore at the 2002 U.S. Open; the denim miniskirt and thigh-high sneaker boots she sported in Flushing Meadows two years later; a one-sleeved tutu dress, which she designed with Nike and the late Virgil Abloh and accessorized with a leather field master jacket and metallic silver sneakers that revealed the word \"queen.\" (Ms. Williams, preparing for the U.S. Open, was unavailable to comment.)</p><p>That same year, when she wore a full-body compression suit to the French Open to help manage postpartum blood clotting, Bernard Giudicelli, president of the French Tennis Federation, announced such ensembles would be subsequently banned for disrespecting \"the game and the place.\"</p><p>\"Whether it was wearing the beads and braids in her hair, or her looks, which were very polarizing, people were concerned about her supporting the traditions of tennis,\" said Tania Flynn, vice president of women's apparel design at Nike, Ms. Williams's longtime sponsor. \"But Serena created a new culture in tennis, and that's what is so inspiring and so lasting in terms of her legacy.\" Ms. Flynn is also a leader within Nike's Serena Williams Design Crew, a six-month apprenticeship program rewarding young designers of color the opportunity to work with Ms. Williams on her Nike collection; some alumni have gone on to work with the company full time.</p><p>\"A lot of times,\" Ms. Flynn added, \"underrepresented groups don't have the opportunity to see how their passions can become their livelihood, and Serena recognizes that.\"</p><p>Though Ms. Williams has donned the swoosh for almost two decades, it was her early tenure at Puma—distinguished by the U.S. Open catsuit and her Cameroonian French Open dress—that began a paradigm shift for women's sportswear, which had until then nurtured conformity more than self-expression. Amy Denet Deal, a former senior women's designer at Puma, said that when she met a 17-year-old Serena, the tennis star came armed with her own sketches, indicating an early predilection for bright colors and unexpected silhouettes.</p><p>\"She had this innate sense of knowing who she was and what she wanted to wear,\" recalled Ms. Denet Deal, a Native American who said she had scarcely had the opportunity to design for other women of color. \"She had a very clear vision of how she wanted to present herself.\"</p><p>By the time a 22-year-old Ms. Williams left Puma to sign an estimated $40 million sponsorship contract with Nike, then the largest ever endorsement deal for a female athlete, she had won six Grand Slams, topped the world rankings and been photographed twice by Annie Leibovitz for Vogue, on whose cover she would appear three more times (and where Ms. Williams, a friend of the magazine's editor in chief Anna Wintour, announced her coming retirement earlier this month).</p><p>Jonathan Johnsongriffin, now Nike's global creative director, was an intern the first time he found himself in a conference room with the tennis star, in 2005. \"Serena is intense and passionate and dedicated on the court, and no one ever doubts that because they see it firsthand,\" he said. \"Designing, she's the same way. She wants to see all the color swatches, she wants to see different trends and cuts, things we can explore with her to push the boundaries of expression.\"</p><p>In 2019, a year after French Open officials took issue with Ms. Williams's Black Panther-inspired compression suit, she returned to Roland Garros in a cape, designed by Virgil Abloh for Nike, emblazoned with the French words for \"mother,\" \"champion,\" \"queen\" and \"goddess.\" Mr. Abloh's widow, Shannon Abloh, now the CEO of his creative corporation, wrote in an email that \"collaborating with Serena was one of the highlights Virgil prized most in his career.\" Before her husband's death in November 2021, \"they were able to create a few truly historic pieces that will be remembered always,\" she said. Early this year, Ms. Williams walked in a tribute runway show for Mr. Abloh's brand Off-White.</p><p>Emiko McCoy, a member of the Serena Williams Design Crew's inaugural class of apprentices, recalled the application process, in which 40 designers of color presented their portfolios at a \"design combine\" at Nike's New York headquarters. In over a decade working in the industry, Ms. McCoy said she had never seen so many designers of color in one room.</p><p>\"The fashion industry needed more diversity,\" she said. \"So Serena has not only influenced the next generation of tennis players, but she's also built a legacy in design.\"</p><p>In Queens later this month, those legacies will merge one last time, when Ms. Williams plays in Arthur Ashe Stadium on the last stop of her farewell tour. But the designers at Nike play it coy when asked what she'll be wearing: perhaps a callback to the pale yellow of her first U.S. Open win, in 1999? Or maybe another catsuit?</p><p>\"All I can say is it will be memorable,\" Ms. Flynn said, with a smile.</p><p>\"Expect the superhero,\" Mr. Johnsongriffin added.</p><p>MORE IN STYLE</p><p>* As Celebrity Backlash Grows, So Does Overall Private Jet Use</p><p>* Looking for a 'Panic Attack' Emoji?
