We are confident in our position and look forward to defending it in court,\" said a spokeswoman for Lululemon.</p><p>Nike didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Lululemon is also involved in a legal battle with Peloton Interactive Inc., in which the apparel maker accuses Peloton of copying the designs of its workout leggings and bras.</p><p>Lululemon acquired Mirror in June 2020 for $500 million to capitalize on the pandemic-fueled home-exercise market.</p><p>Mirror sells a $1,500 tech-enabled mirror with a camera and speakers so customers can participate in live fitness classes at home.</p>",
