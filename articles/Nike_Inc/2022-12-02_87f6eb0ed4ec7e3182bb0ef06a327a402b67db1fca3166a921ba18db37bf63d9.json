  "text": "<p><strong>My</strong> <strong>personal style signifiers</strong> are tattoos, Nike sneakers, and oversized T-shirts, often with a lot of colour because that&#xa0;reflects my personality. I think a casual&#xa0;style – and being comfortable in the&#xa0;kitchen – is the&#xa0;way to go. The tattoos serve as special&#xa0;souvenirs from the places I've been.&#xa0;I started getting them when I&#xa0;was&#xa0;younger whenever I went on a trip – such&#xa0;as my sleeve, which is in the Māori&#xa0;style, from Tahiti. I also have tattoos&#xa0;that reflect my work, such as the&#xa0;rolling of dough or the fruit trees that&#xa0;inspire my creations.</p> <p><strong>The last thing I bought and loved</strong> was a special birthday dinner for friends in Bali.&#xa0;We ate delicious burgers on the beach with our feet in the sand.</p> <p><strong>The best souvenir I've brought home</strong> are vanilla beans from Tahiti. These beans are so floral, and I've developed several new pastries for my bakery Cédric Grolet Opéra and Le Meurice. I like to use one main ingredient – for example, my Vanilla Flower cake is a mix of vanilla ganache, vanilla almond biscuit, vanilla milk jam and vanilla&#xa0;cream. And my Vanilla Bean is a trompe-l'oeil pastry that you cut into to&#xa0;reveal a variety of textures.</p> <p><strong>The best book I've read in the past year </strong>is <em>Les Lapins Ne Mangent Pas De Carottes </em>(Rabbits Don't Eat Carrots) by journalist Hugo Clément, which looks at climate change and biodiversity. I also published my own <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/books\">book</a> this year, <em>Flowers</em>. It took me more than a year to complete, so it's been incredible to see it come to fruition.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>In my fridge you'll always find </strong>water and fresh fruits and vegetables. I'm very careful about my health and what I eat, so I&#xa0;tend towards unprocessed things. I like to have fresh juices in the morning, especially pineapple juice, so I always have that on hand. If I'm in London, working at my patisserie at The Berkeley, however, I'll usually just wait until I get to their kitchens, as the juice there is amazing.</p> <p><strong>My style icon </strong>is the New York-based artist&#xa0;Daniel Arsham. I love his art, film and&#xa0;architecture work – and his subject matter, which is often in a state of decay. And then his personal style – the way he wears workwear clothing, and even his sneakers… it all just works.</p> <p><strong>The festive tradition I most look forward to</strong> is returning home to my family for the holidays. Once we're all together again, we just chill out for four&#xa0;straight hours and eat bread and drink hot chocolate. It's a delicious and simple time, but it's about connection. It's also when we like to have the special bûches de&#xa0;Noël cakes of my childhood.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>I don't listen to</strong> podcasts because I am very focused on my work and, although I know that TV, social media and podcasts are great sources of knowledge, I prefer not to be influenced by other people's ideas.</p> <p><strong>The best gift I've given recently</strong> is a gold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3517709b-bdeb-4735-8741-0ea3de65d73d\">Cartier</a> Love bracelet to my girlfriend, Astrid-Olivia. I like to think that I am good&#xa0;at giving thoughtful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/shopping-gifts\">presents</a>, but this&#xa0;one was special because it was the first&#xa0;important show of my love for her.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>And the best gift I've received</strong> is a two-day camping trip in the jungles of Bali for a special celebration. My friends took me and we snorkelled, and ate and slept outside. It was a special time because of the company and also because we were all away from technology and focused on&#xa0;our time together.</p> <p><strong>The last music I downloaded </strong>was by Brown Sugar. I like music that starts out slow and builds to a faster tempo to give good vibes and positive energy. I am always listening to music – while I am exercising, relaxing at home and, of course, cooking. At my café you'll always hear chill music like&#xa0;“Something About You” by Elderbrook and Rudimental. It&#xa0;just sets the right tone.</p> <p><strong>The place I am excited to go&#xa0;to next</strong> is to Megève or Praz-sur-Arly this winter, to snowboard with friends. I am looking forward to any trip, anywhere, that involves snowboarding, but the French Alps are always my favourite for&#xa0;the terrain.</p> <p><strong>I have a collection</strong> of pastry books and books about sports cars. I have a lot by noted French chefs and friends such as Pierre Hermé, Christophe Adam and Alain Ducasse, and also books about Formula 1 and, specifically, Lamborghinis, which I am obsessed with. Books about watches are another interest. All&#xa0;of these interests are linked by the requirement for extreme precision in their execution.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The thing I couldn't do without</strong> is my exercise routine. I&#xa0;like to go to the gym at the Hôtel Plaza Athénée before work and this time allows me to focus. If&#xa0;I&#xa0;am not feeling creative or positive, I'll just work out to feel better. One hour of cardio and weights with my trainer per day is a necessity for me.</p> <p><strong>I've recently rediscovered</strong> Jean-François Piège's Le Grand Restaurant, in Paris. The&#xa0;cuisine and his technique are so&#xa0;precise, but nothing is ever fussy. The&#xa0;marble and wood panelling and the sculptural glass ceiling make this room very&#xa0;special. I had lobster cooked right in&#xa0;front of me – in the Parisien pavé cooking style – with which I drank a Domaine de la Grange des Pères 2008.</p> <p><strong>The last item of clothing I added to my&#xa0;wardrobe</strong> was a pair of Travis Scott x&#xa0;Nike sneakers. I'm a big fan of sneakers generally, but these are a collector's item, and they haven't come out of the box yet. I like their cream-white colour with touches of brown and red, and I think it's the rarity factor that makes them so cool.</p> <p><strong>An indulgence I would never forgo</strong> is frothy cappuccinos. The mix of espresso and steamed milk with&#xa0;a sprinkling of chocolate is one of life's&#xa0;great pleasures.</p> <p><strong>The best bits of advice I ever received</strong> were from my family when I was growing up. I was taught to be respectful and polite to everyone, and my mother told me to always bring&#xa0;flowers because they make people smile. Another important influence was Alain Ducasse, who suggested that I&#xa0;cut back on the sweetness of desserts and focus instead on the natural flavours of the fruits and other ingredients I use. This has made all the difference.</p> <p><strong>My favourite room in my house</strong> is my wine cellar, which is a sort of separate space as part of my kitchen. I had a niche designed to hold 10 racks of wines, mostly from Bordeaux. I particularly love good reds from Saint-Joseph and Saint-Émilion, but I also have bottles of Ruinart and Billecart-Salmon, as well as white and rosé&#xa0;wines. I find it a serene place to be.</p> <p><strong>My favourite building</strong> is Château La Coste in the South of France. The architecture by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31ed37bc-a313-4919-8a8f-ebaf50fb2b4a\">Tadao Ando</a> and Renzo Piano, and work by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Ai Weiwei – it's perfection,&#xa0;as are the food, the wine, the&#xa0;olive groves and the service. Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is also incredible – a feat of engineering, with the world's longest elevated pool spread across the roof of its three buildings.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The grooming staple I'm never without </strong>is SVR Cicavit+ cream for my&#xa0;tattoos. I put it on every morning&#xa0;to&#xa0;preserve their colour as they tend to fade over time. It's&#xa0;also&#xa0;extremely moisturising and&#xa0;provides SPF50+, too. <em>£12.50,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://uk.labo-svr.com/\"><em>uk.labo-svr.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>My grooming and wellbeing gurus</strong> include Anastasia, my personal trainer who I met via the app TrainMe, and also my barber Thomas at <a href=\"https://www.planity.com/le-barbutier-paris-75001\">Le Barbutier</a>, who is very important to my overall style. I have been going to him for three years, and he is always available, which is a help with my hectic schedule.</p> <p><strong>In another life, I would have been</strong> a soccer player or a Formula 1 race-car driver. I love the athleticism and commitment in both of these sports.</p> <p><strong>The place that means a lot to me</strong> is the&#xa0;Loire Valley. I grew up there, and I love to go fishing with friends in its rivers, especially the Rhône. This is when I feel most at peace. At the age of 13, I began working in my grandparents' hotel-restaurant in Andrézieux-Bouthéon, and it's where I learned to cook and make pastry, so it will always be home.</p><p>Source: Christina Ohly-Evans.
