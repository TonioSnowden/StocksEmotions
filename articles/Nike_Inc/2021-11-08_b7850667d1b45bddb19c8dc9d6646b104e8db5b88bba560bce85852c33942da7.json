  "text": "<p>But if it doesn't, Mr. Harker, who does not currently have a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said the U.S. central bank may need to act to push inflation back toward the central bank's 2% target.</p><p>He weighed in after last week's decision by the Fed to start slowing the pace of its bond-buying stimulus effort with an eye toward ending it by the middle of next year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week the Fed is not near a decision to raise rates, but many outside observers say high inflation may force the central bank into action next year.</p><p>\"I don't expect that the federal funds rate will rise before the tapering is complete, but we are monitoring inflation very closely and are prepared to take action, should circumstances warrant it,\" Mr. Harker said.</p><p>The central banker also said the process of reopening the economy has been uneven.</p><p>\"Our recovery looks like a Nike swoosh drawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee ... We're climbing undeniably upward, but it's a jagged path,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Harker sees the 2021 gross domestic product rise at 5.5%, with growth at 4% next year and between 2% and 3% by 2023. He also expects more workers to reenter the labor force over time, improving the nation's employment outlook.</p><p>Write to Michael S. Derby at michael.derby@wsj.com</p>",
