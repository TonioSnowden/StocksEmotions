  "title": "Michael Pollan on How Psychedelics Will Play a Bigger Role in American Life; 'There will be a medical industry providing psychedelic therapy,' the author and professor predicts. Inside his morning routine.",
  "text": "<p>Laughing is only part of Mr. Pollan's three-and-a-half hours of morning routines: He starts the day by reading the newspapers in bed for 45 minutes before getting dressed, then fixes a cup of green tea, eats breakfast and reads more of the paper. His wife, artist Judith Belzer, joins him for 45 minutes of floor exercises: weights and stretches and abdominals. They then start with CNN before switching to Mr. Colbert.</p><p>The couple then meditates for a half-hour, goes on a walk in the Berkeley Hills and grabs coffee. Mr. Pollan, who abstained from caffeine for three months as research for his book This Is Your Mind on Plants, is now back to one cup of coffee per day. After all of that, he gets to work around 9:30 a.m.</p><p>The author of bestselling books including The Omnivore's Dilemma and How to Change Your Mind, Mr. Pollan recently adapted the latter into a four-part Netflix docuseries on using psychedelics to treat mental illness. Each episode focuses on one drug: LSD, psilocybin, MDMA and mescaline. Here, he speaks to WSJ. about the new show and what he thinks the psychedelic landscape in the U.S. will look like in five years.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays?</p><p>I wake up around 6 a.m. My alarm is set for 6:30, but I usually get up at 6 on my own.</p><p>What do you eat for breakfast to start the week off right?</p><p>I'm really partial to toast. I bake a lot of bread, so on a good morning I'm eating a slice or two of toast from bread that I baked, which is whole grain. I could put a variety of things on it, ranging from peanut butter, to hummus, to butter and jelly, to preserves of other kinds. I might mix it up some days if there's really good fresh fruit. Right now we have very good stone fruit here in California, so I might have that with muesli and milk. Or, fake milk, actually—oat milk or macadamia nut milk. During breakfast, I'm reading the hard copy of the paper. Then my wife will join me.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>Intermittently. I'm a bad vitamin-taker. I have a regime that I try to take which includes a multivitamin, Omega-3s, curcumin, various things I'm experimenting with because I heard about them—there's a supplement called Canna, which many of the people I've been interviewing in the psychedelic world swear by and is something that's sort of like MDMA. I've noticed no effects of any kind and it's very expensive.</p><p>How does your workday start off?</p><p>The workday begins with email. Living on the West Coast, so much stuff happens before you wake up. When I'm on the East Coast, I can avoid looking at email until lunchtime, which I think is very healthy.</p><p>After emails, what are your writing and research routines like?</p><p>On writing days, and they're by no means all writing days—like you, I have reporting days; I have days when I'm working on other projects—there are very few typical days, but when I'm done reporting for a piece and in the writing mode, the way it usually works is I begin the day by reading over what I wrote the day before. I teach writing and I tell my students that this is not necessarily the best way to do it, but since I began as an editor, editing is a big part of my writing process. I like to use those really clear hours in the morning to go back to the beginning of whatever the piece or the book chapter is and read through it with a pen in my hand and make revisions. [For me,] writing starts with revising, then I move forward and write a few more pages. It means you end up with a very polished first draft, but it also means you get too wedded to what you worked on so hard and then ripping it up later is more difficult. And that's why I tell my students, you know—it might be better to just write a sloppy draft. I've never been able to do it.</p><p>At what time of the day or week are you most creative or productive?</p><p>I would say there are two times. The morning for me are the best hours, the clearest hours; I do my best work. But a big part of writing is just walking around thinking about where you go next. Writing is a process of navigating forking paths, and there are so many choices you make. Am I going to go here now, or there now? And a lot of that I play out when I'm walking. I like to walk by myself in the afternoon.</p><p>In How to Change Your Mind the book, you described your skepticism about psychedelics, and in the new docuseries, you seem much more comfortable with their healing potential. Could you speak about how your mindset has evolved as you've done this work over the years?</p><p>The big change is that when I started the book, I'd had very limited experience in psychedelics. I did not use them at the appropriate time, as a college student or in my 20s. I was frankly too nervous about them; I believed all the propaganda, about how they would inspire you to jump off of buildings or stare at the sun until you go blind, all the horror stories. It was only when I started talking to people whose lives had been changed by psychedelics. The first group were these cancer patients who had gotten these horrible diagnoses and were in a state of very high anxiety and fear. They had had psychedelic experiences that had completely reset their attitude toward their death and their life. This, to me, was astonishing.</p><p>In the course of writing How to Change Your Mind, I had a series of psychedelic experiences, some of them guided professionally and some of them on my own or with my wife and this changed my attitude about it profoundly. I got somewhat comfortable in the territory, which is very weird—it can be frightening territory. I gradually became convinced of their potential to help people break habits; to help treat mental illness; to help with relationships. I still have areas of skepticism. I think the research—we still need more of it—I don't think it's completely proven out. But we have enough evidence to say there's potentially an important tool in improving well-being and treating mental health.</p><p>By the time the filming came along, I was in a different place. I wasn't that fearful newbie. I had talked to enough people who have had these experiences and I understood the science well enough to be persuaded that there was something here.</p><p>What do you think the psychedelic landscape will look like in the next five years?</p><p>As you know as a journalist, predicting the future is kind of a fool's errand, but I'm happy to do it anyway. I think you're going to see that MDMA will be approved for the treatment of PTSD by the FDA within two years. And that psilocybin will be approved for the treatment of depression within, I don't know, four or five years. In Oregon, as of next year, you will be able to get a guided psilocybin experience from a licensed guide using psilocybin from a licensed grower. It's quite remarkable as a state going their own way with what is still a Schedule I drug. There will be a medical industry providing psychedelic therapy; at the same time, there will continue to be an underground, that is to say people who will administer and guide you through a psychedelic experience who are not licensed and are acting illegally, as is happening now and is growing by leaps and bounds, as far as I can see.</p><p>What have you been reading and watching lately?</p><p>We just went through Hacks, which bizarrely had a mention of How to Change Your Mind, when the young woman says to the older woman—they're having breakfast together—and she thinks she's being helpful: \"You know that psychedelics can really help you break out of habits.\" And the older woman says, \"You read too much.\" I was shocked.</p><p>I'm reading Ed Yong's new book, The Immense World, about animal senses and how animals perceive the world. It's a fascinating book. I'm reading a lot of books about my next project, which is about consciousness, so I've been reading a lot of theoretical books about consciousness. One I really like is called Being You: A New Science of Consciousness by Anil Seth.</p><p>What's one piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>It came from my dad, who was a great believer in getting over your fears of doing new things. Long before Nike said, \"Just do it,\" he was a great proponent of that. If it's getting married, buying a house, changing careers, quitting your job—so many of us get frozen at those moments that we spend a long time debating back and forth. He always said, \"Take the leap,\" and I've tried to honor that. It's served me well. Moments [like] we picked up and moved out to California, I became a professor, which I've never done before, or quit my job editing to become a writer. These were all leaps into the unknown and I've regretted none of them.</p><p>Michael Pollan on How Psychedelics Will Play a Bigger Role in American Life</p>",
