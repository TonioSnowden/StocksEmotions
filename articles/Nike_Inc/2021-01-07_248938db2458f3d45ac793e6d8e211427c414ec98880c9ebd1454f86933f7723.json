  "text": "<p><em>In anticipation of salons reopening in England on 12 April, we revisit our list of the best beauty destinations, originally published in January 2021 . . . </em></p> <h1>FACE</h1> <p><strong>Alexandra Soveral, London<br></strong>Working from a small studio in Maida Vale,&#xa0;facialist Alexandra Soveral's natural approach to skin emphasises tissue and muscle manipulation via lots of massage, to&#xa0;de-stress knotted brows, tighten jaw muscles and promote circulation. Her holistic approach is coupled with her own line of mostly organic products: try the antioxidant-rich face masks to plump and boost radiance, or the beautifully crafted rose and neroli toning mist. As her loyal clientele will testify, you'll see the worries lift from your face. Better still, she's the only <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6bbe696-ef46-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901\">facial therapist</a> I've met who can magic up cheekbones using only her fingers. Soveral doesn't often do the therapies herself these days, but a global team are well-trained to use her unique skincare method (facials, from £80; consultation with Soveral, from&#xa0;£250). <strong>Kathleen Baird-Murray</strong><em> <br>97D&#xa0;Elgin Ave, W9; </em><a href=\"https://alexandrasoveral.co.uk/\"><em>alexandrasoveral.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>Melanie Grant, Sydney<br></strong>With salons in Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne and – occasionally – Paris, the facialist Melanie Grant is almost as jet-set as her clients (Victoria Beckham, Jennifer Aniston, Joan Smalls and Cassandra Grey, to name a few). Skin is prepped with a&#xa0;thorough cleanse by one of her highly trained assistants, followed by either microdermabrasion, a gentle peel, an ultrasound infusion of vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, light therapy or plenty of massage, according to any skin concerns. Don't even think about getting an appointment in Oscar week – she's the red carpet's go-to for glow (Camera-Ready Facial, from $390). <strong>KB-M</strong><em> <br>3&#xa0;Transvaal Ave, NSW 2028; </em><a href=\"http://www.melaniegrant.com/\"><em>melaniegrant.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Skin Matters, London<br></strong>Joanne Evans' salon in Holland Park is a&#xa0;cosily curated haven, made exceptional by&#xa0;her brilliant team. With more than 25&#xa0;years of experience, Evans has the hands&#xa0;of a real master and an encyclopedic knowledge of the treatment business. Each facial – from collagen-stimulation therapy (from £260) to cosmetic acupuncture (£180) – is bespoke, while the products she&#xa0;uses are extensively researched. Using state-of‑the-art technology, Evans's facials&#xa0;leave your skin looking next-level fantastic; you will leave her salon feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. <strong>Fiona Golfar&#xa0;</strong><em> <br>119B Portland Rd, W11; </em><a href=\"https://www.skin-matters.co.uk/\"><em>skin-matters.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>BBB LONDON, London<br></strong>We all know of Vanita Parti's brow bars, which first sprung up in central London locations around 16 years ago. But did you know she was campaigning tirelessly to get all beauty salons open again after lockdown? We can now show our gratitude by paying her efficient salons a visit – and get <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35cc5a98-00d2-11e6-99cb-83242733f755\">great brows</a> in the process. They consistently deliver neat but full-looking brows in a&#xa0;speedy 15 minutes, and you could also step it up a bit by adding a tint to your usual&#xa0;threading for a dramatic and instant pick-me-up (£25 for threading; £40 for threading and tint). Parti's threaders excel – I've only ever had good experiences. <strong>KB-M <br></strong><a href=\"https://bbb-london.com/\"><em>bbb-london.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>New York Dermatology Group, New York and London<br></strong>If you've had the pleasure of meeting medical director Dr Costas Papageorgiou, you will know he is a total perfectionist –&#xa0;and honest to the point of brutal. From spaces in both New York and London, his&#xa0;clinic offers top of the range therapies from Triad facials – a three-step treatment that requires a 3D scan of your face (a&#xa0;personal favourite) – to light therapy that&#xa0;helps improve wrinkles and skin tone. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jellison22/?hl=en\"><em>HTSI</em>&#xa0;editor Jo Ellison</a> is a fan of the Titan laser treatment (from £950) for saggy jawlines (and anything else that's looser than you might like), and also recommends the Limelight Illumino Rejuvenation treatment (from £500), which uses lasers to&#xa0;zap vascular imperfections and uneven skin tone. Each treatment is based on an&#xa0;individual assessment on appointment – a uniquely bespoke experience. And if&#xa0;needles are your thing, he's got plenty of 'em too. <strong>Flora Macdonald Johnston</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>119 Fifth Ave, NY 10003, and Harrods, London;&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.nydermatologygroup.com/\"><em>nydermatologygroup.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Acqua di Parma Barbiere, Rome<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30b58456-019b-44ff-aac9-338d02dd2ab3\">Barbering</a> has a 2,000-year history in Italy – so it's no wonder that a quintessentially Italian fragrance house such as Acqua di Parma takes the discipline seriously. Tucked at the back of its Rome boutique, the scent‑<br>master's Barbiere offers a trim menu of clean shaves and beard tidies in luxurious, lemon yellow-accented surroundings (traditional shave and grooming, €40). The&#xa0;best part? Each treatment is finished with your choice of spritz from the brand's extensive selection. <em>Perfetto!</em> <strong>Nick Carvell&#xa0;<br></strong><em>Piazza di Spagna 27, 00187; </em><a href=\"https://www.acquadiparma.com/en/gb/\"><em>acquadiparma.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Skin Design, London<br></strong>There's good reason that Fatma Shaheem is&#xa0;a favourite among the fashion crowd –&#xa0;she's a deft hand at creating glowing, photo-ready skin. The London-based facialist, who has a residency at John Bell&#xa0;&amp;&#xa0;Croyden in Marylebone, specialises in non-surgical treatments such as collagen‑boosting microneedling (£75) and&#xa0;cheek-lifting radio-frequency treatments (£250), as well as a range of&#xa0;peels (from £85). Shaheem has also developed her own range of skincare – including <a href=\"https://goop.com/skin-design-london-face-bath/p/\">the bestselling Face Bath cleanser</a> (£80) and C Antioxidant Glow Serum (£115) – which has been snapped up by wellbeing website Goop. <strong>Jessica Beresford</strong><em> <br>50‑54&#xa0;Wigmore St, W1; </em><a href=\"https://skindesignlondon.com/\"><em>skindesignlondon.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Brows by Nikki, Dallas<br></strong>To call Nikki Amini an esthetician would be&#xa0;dramatically understating her talents. Based between Los Angeles and Dallas, Amini (the hands behind Brows By Nikki) is a brow artist beyond compare. Threading is her method of hair removal (from $35) and the results are always full, groomed, natural-looking brows. Amini also makes house calls and offers brow tinting ($20) and lamination ($140). <strong>Cherish&#xa0;Rufus</strong><em> <br>9409 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills, CA; </em><a href=\"https://www.mybrowsbynikki.com/\"><em>mybrowsbynikki.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Neal's Yard Remedies, London<br></strong>Tucked behind the hustle and bustle of Borough Market lies the oasis of calm that is Neal's Yard Remedies Therapy Rooms. In this cosy upstairs space, a crack team of experts conduct acupuncture and a host of&#xa0;other alternative therapies (from £45). Go for the facial rejuvenation massage, where any tension held in the scalp, forehead and jaw is gently kneaded away with one of the brand's essential oils. <strong>Charlene Prempeh</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>12 Stoney St, SE1; </em><a href=\"https://www.nealsyardremedies.com/\"><em>nealsyardremedies.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>KMPSkin, London<br></strong>Katharine Mackenzie Paterson breaks the mould of cookie-cutter facialists, offering a&#xa0;bespoke service that uses a variety of technologies (microcurrent and LED light therapy are standard) as well as a range of&#xa0;carefully curated skincare brands. “I'm not into trends and fads, and prefer to build a long-term relationship so that we can achieve healthy, beautiful skin,” she says. Her signature treatment in South Molton Street or by appointment in your home varies from person to person, but expect 90&#xa0;minutes of cleansing, exfoliating “and then whatever I need to do to get the best results” (from £160). If you're lucky, that will include a massage for the neck and jaw to reduce tension in the face – she's got the best hands in the business. <strong>KB-M</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>58 South Molton St, W1; </em><a href=\"http://kmpskin.com/\"><em>kmpskin.com</em></a></p> <h1>HAIR</h1> <p><strong>Subrina Kidd, London<br></strong>From pin-straight and wavy to curly and coily, Subrina Kidd is one of the rare stylists who knows how to work with every type of hair texture. With more than 20 years' experience, the London-based hairdresser has worked with global hair brands such as Aveda, on fashion shows and editorials. You need to be quick to get into her appointment book, but if you can nab a spot, it will probably be the best haircut of your life. <strong>CR</strong><em> <br>Haircut with Kidd, from £105. 16&#xa0;Marylebone St, W1; </em><a href=\"http://hairbythecollective.com/\"><em>hairbythecollective.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Massimo Serini, Rome<br></strong>Full disclosure: I am a diehard Josh Wood girl. But Covid thwarted that love affair when I relocated to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be64eee5-b981-4c76-8fb4-83368541b87f\">Rome</a>, a city where subtle blonde tresses are in conspicuously short supply, and painfully brassy ones all too common. Step forward Massimo Serini, who was recommended to me, separately, by two friends. Senior colourist Antonina (“Nina”) Popa took me to a gratifyingly pretty (and understated) cream-and-honey place with a&#xa0;careful balayage that wasn't too precise. Serini himself worked one subtle but genius layer into my super-fine locks with a 15-minute trim. He is also one of the sweetest humans alive, and his Spanish Steps atelier a&#xa0;cinch to get to. <strong>Maria Shollenbarger <br></strong><em>Colour, from €80. Haircuts, from €60. Via Borgognona 2, 00187; </em><a href=\"https://www.massimoserini.com/en/home-2/\"><em>massimoserini.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Hershesons, London<br></strong>This family-run salon – boasting two flagship locations and three blow-dry bars in London – is a hot ticket for editors and supermodels (anyone who looks after Claudia Schiffer's hair…). Each salon has the signature green marble, glass and steel interior, and even the own-brand styling tools have Instagram appeal. On booking, you'll be assigned a&#xa0;technician who best suits your needs, or&#xa0;you can make an appointment with founder Daniel or his son Luke. <strong>FMJ<br></strong><em>Classic blow-dry, from £17.50. Appointments with Daniel or Luke Hersheson, from £360. 29&#xa0;Berners St, W1; </em><a href=\"https://www.hershesons.com/\"><em>hershesons.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Church Barber &amp; Apothecary, San Francisco<br></strong>Ryan and Beatrice Gonzalez opened their botanical barbershop in the vibey San Francisco neighbourhood of Hayes Valley in&#xa0;2017. Since then this sleek outpost has gained a devoted following for its plant-based products and in-house playlists (search “churchbarber” on Spotify). First-timers should book a Sunday Service, which kicks off with a full skin and hair consultation, followed by a cut and the signature grooming regimen, Church Ritual. Praise be. <strong>NC</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>Haircut, $60. Sunday Service, $90. 524&#xa0;Octavia St, 94102; </em><a href=\"https://churchbarber.com/\"><em>churchbarber.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Shin Salon, Santa Monica<br></strong>Set in a quaint bungalow in bustling Santa Monica, this salon draws fans so devout they've been called “Shinheads”. They flock to stylist Shin An for her precise dry cuts, incomparable sun-kissed highlights and a&#xa0;signature purifying scalp treatment that tames the most tired hair. The studio offers a Zen atmosphere with bamboo scrolls and screens and a patio for (Covid-friendly) outdoor styling. <strong>Christina Ohly Evans <br></strong><em>Dry&#xa0;cuts, from $200 (from $300 with Shin An). 1025 Montana Ave, 90403; </em><a href=\"https://www.shinhair.com/\"><em>shinhair.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Joe &amp; Co, London<br></strong>You might not know barber Joe Mills by name, but you'll have seen his work on the&#xa0;red carpet: Paul Mescal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc2b9f10-7bb7-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\">Taron Egerton</a> and Martin Freeman regularly call on his services. Mills has passed this expertise on to the team at his chilled Soho barbershop, who can tackle and style, fade or cut. Kick back with a beer and relax in the knowledge that, whether you need a trim or a total transformation, you'll be getting a cut worthy of a world premiere. <strong>NC</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>From £48. 22 Peter St, W1; </em><a href=\"https://www.joeandco.net/\"><em>joeandco.net</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Nicola Clarke at John Frieda, London<br></strong>Tucked away just behind Oxford Circus,&#xa0;you'll find the discreet salon of arguably London's best hair colourist. Although it's her way with natural-looking blondes that has made her famous – Kate&#xa0;Moss, Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet&#xa0;have been clients for many years – Clarke is also adept at transformational rock-star colour, recently turning Madonna pink, two-toning Dua Lipa and taking actress Rose Victoria Williams from brown&#xa0;to Mae West blonde. Loved for&#xa0;her&#xa0;support&#xa0;of&#xa0;new talent (see her&#xa0;protégé&#xa0;Jasmin if you can't get an&#xa0;appointment with Clarke herself), she&#xa0;was&#xa0;instrumental&#xa0;in&#xa0;unifying the lockdown&#xa0;process among West End hairdressers – no mean feat. <strong>KB-M <br></strong><em>From £150 for a tint with Clarke. 58-59 Margaret St, W1; </em><a href=\"https://www.nicolaclarkeatjohnfrieda.com/\"><em>nicolaclarkeatjohnfrieda.com</em></a></p> <h1>NAILS &amp; FEET</h1> <p><strong>Nails by Mei, New York<br></strong>When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1698b7a-a735-11ea-92e2-cbd9b7e28ee6\">nail art</a>, New York-based Japanese manicurist Mei Kawajiri is a virtuoso. She's worked on fun, maximalist designs for Marc Jacobs and Alexander Wang shows, as well as creating looks for the Hadid sisters and Ariana Grande. She also does the odd pared-back and elegant manicure. There is nothing she can't do, and&#xa0;it keeps her in high demand. <strong>CR</strong><em>&#xa0;<br></em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nailsbymei/?hl=en\"><em>@nailsbymei</em></a></p> <p><strong>DryBy, London<br></strong>When this stylish, modern-looking nail and&#xa0;hair salon first opened in Mortimer Street a few years ago, every other nail bar had to up its game considerably. Those in the know ask for Andrea (although all the technicians are exceptionally well-trained), who is just as skilled with classic manicures and pedicures (from £42) as nail art and extensions (from £90). Look out for regular design collaborations with the likes of beauty influencer Alex Steinherr, which are subtly eye-catching and sophisticated. <strong>KB-M<br></strong><em>74 Mortimer St, W1; </em><a href=\"http://dryby.co.uk/\"><em>dryby.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>Herb House Spa, New Forest<br></strong>The spa at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53c4afb0-6460-11df-8cba-00144feab49a\">Lime Wood Hotel</a> boasts a hydrotherapy pool overlooking a forest, a mud house, a large sauna and eight treatment rooms. It is easy to while away the hours spotting deer and dipping in and out of the outdoor hot pool. All this effort can be hard on the feet, so the full pedicure (£50), starting with a hot soak and ending with a massage, is exactly what's needed to finish the day. <strong>CP <br></strong><em>Beaulieu Rd, Lyndhurst, Hampshire; </em><a href=\"https://www.limewoodhotel.co.uk/\"><em>limewoodhotel.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>Nuka Nails, London<br></strong>Kaddy, one half of the nail duo behind this&#xa0;salon, is a ray of sunshine. Within the Ladbroke Grove space, which blasts R&amp;B and house music, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nuka.nails/?hl=en\">Kaddy</a> specialises in hand-painted nail art and&#xa0;gel manicures, and is&#xa0;so&#xa0;in-demand that she recently collaborated with Nike and Depop. Although you could get a plain gel mani, have some fun and try her nail art, which ranges from piano keys to&#xa0;tongue-in-cheek Ikea logos and “Burberry” checks (from £50). “I've got the eye for different,” she says – and it's true. <strong>FG</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>144 Ladbroke Grove, W10; </em><a href=\"https://www.nukanails.com/\"><em>nukanails.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Bastien Gonzalez, Paris<br></strong>If you want deluxe-looking feet, with toenails as naturally pink as the inside of a&#xa0;conch shell washed up on a beach in the Maldives, Gonzalez is the original and the best. A skilled podiatrist, he uses diamond-dust drills to buff nails, and leaves your feet&#xa0;baby-soft while also addressing more serious niggling concerns such as ingrown nails. He's based in Paris but has locations around the world – get on his email list to&#xa0;see when he's next visiting one near you&#xa0;(from £140). <strong>KB-M </strong><em><br>8 Véro Dodat, 75001; </em><a href=\"https://reverencedebastien.fr/\"><em>reverencedebastien.fr</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <h1>BODY</h1> <p><strong>Naoshima Bath House, Naoshima<br></strong>Arriving in Naoshima is to become part of a&#xa0;town-wide art installation: buses splashed with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e203271d-1e93-4152-8dc9-5c1cc08c9c37\">Yayoi Kusama</a> spots and buildings with mind-bending Turrell pieces. In the middle is Naoshima bathhouse, a sanctuary created by artist Shinro Ohtake. Here, speakers play the minimalist tunes of Roger and Brian Eno as you sink into the heat of the water. <strong>CP&#xa0;<br></strong><em>Admission, ¥660. 2252-2 Naoshima, Kagawa 7613110; </em><a href=\"https://benesse-artsite.jp/\"><em>benesse-artsite.jp</em></a></p> <p><strong>Ayasofya Hurrem Sultan Hamam,&#xa0;Istanbul&#xa0;<br></strong>This hammam is often described as one of the most beautiful in Istanbul – a feast for the eyes, as well as a space to relax. In a heated white-marble tiled room, you are scrubbed from head to toe, doused in relaxing bubble wash and then led to join the small groups dotted around in white robes, drinking Turkish tea and gossiping. <strong>CP</strong><em>&#xa0;<br>From €55. Cankurtaran, Ayasofya Meydanı No:2, 34122; </em><a href=\"https://www.ayasofyahamami.com/\"><em>ayasofyahamami.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Bamford Wellness Spa, Cotswolds<br></strong>Lots of spas talk about getting back to nature, few are located in the middle of an organic farm. But despite its very English setting, it's the expertise – with many treatments devised by practitioners whom founder, Carole Bamford, discovered in India – that always makes the Bamford Wellness Spa worth the trip. A new and much bigger extension this year sees the addition of a wellness space for everything from yoga (£18) to crystal healing (£150). <strong>Nicola Moulton</strong><em><br>Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucs; </em><a href=\"https://www.bamford.com/uk/\"><em>bamford.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Mandarin Oriental Spa, New York<br></strong>A great massage is thrilling enough, but this quite literally takes the experience to new heights, thanks to the Mandarin Oriental's location on floors 35-54 of the Time Warner Center above Columbus Circle (from $250). With a massage bed by the window, there's something enchanting about lying facedown and watching little ant-like people and teeny yellow taxis busying themselves below. <strong>NM</strong><em> <br>80 Columbus Cir, 10023; </em><a href=\"http://mandarinoriental.com/\"><em>mandarinoriental.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Monverde Spa, Amarante<br></strong>Just outside Porto, set in rolling green hills, is the Monverde Wine Experience Hotel, which offers tastings, bike rides and picnics among the vineyards. After a day of activity you can retreat to the spa, where treatments range from black caviar protein facials (€65)&#xa0;to standard pedicures. A highlight is&#xa0;the Devine Grapes Body Ritual (€120), a&#xa0;process involving a gentle exfoliation with&#xa0;grape seeds, a cool body wrap and an aromatherapy massage with vine-leaf oil. <strong>CP <br></strong><em>Quinta de Sanguinhedo 166, Castanheiro Redondo, 4600-761 Telões; </em><a href=\"http://www.monverde.pt/en/\"><em>monverde.pt</em></a></p> <p><strong>Espace Vitalité Chenot, Marrakech&#xa0;<br></strong>Unlike its stablemates, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4d8f93-703c-4423-a8cc-74b42c8f949c\">Marrakech</a> outpost of this spa at the five-star Selman Hotel offers an out-of-this-world traditional hammam. The 75-minute treatment (about £100) includes a thorough and rejuvenating black-soap scrub followed by a mind-melting massage.
