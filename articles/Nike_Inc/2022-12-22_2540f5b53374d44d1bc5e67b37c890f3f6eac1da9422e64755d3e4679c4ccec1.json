  "title": "Nike's Inventory Problem: Passing It Along --- Stockpiles are bloated, but wholesale customers still clamor for its products",
  "text": "<p>There was a lot to like in Nike's latest performance: The company said on Tuesday that revenue was up 28% on a currency-neutral basis in its fiscal quarter ended Nov. 30 compared with a year earlier. Its top line was 5.9% higher than analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected.</p><p>Impressively, its sales growth is only slightly behind that of Lululemon, which is growing off a revenue base that is just 14% of Nike's. Net income was flat compared with a year earlier, much better than the 23% decline Wall Street was penciling in.</p><p>Nike raised its guidance for the full fiscal year, expecting revenue to grow more than 10% on a currency-neutral basis, up from its prior expectation of roughly 5% growth. Investors liked what they heard, sending Nike stock up 12% on Wednesday.</p><p>One major miss in Nike's results was in inventory, which was up 43% compared with a year earlier, only a slight improvement from the preceding quarter's 44% bloat. Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said on an earnings call on Tuesday that prior-year comparisons aren't fair because inventory was abnormally low last year because of factory closures in Vietnam. Still, Wall Street analysts -- who no doubt track that kind of dynamic very closely -- had been expecting that bloat to be just 28% above year-earlier levels.</p><p>Luckily for Nike, there are players on the field that will happily take the inventory. Sales through the wholesale channel grew by 30% on a currency-neutral basis, outpacing direct sales growth of 25%. \"Really for the first time in six quarters or so, we can finally supply the [wholesale] channel with the level of demand that we believe is there,\" Mr. Friend said on the call.</p><p>Stronger demand from wholesale channels meant Nike hasn't had to discount as heavily: Gross margins were a better-than-expected 42.9%, a 3-percentage-point decline from a year earlier. Foot Locker stock prices rose nearly 10% on Wednesday, while Dick's Sporting Goods gained 3%, indicating that investors welcome wholesale partners' sudden access to more Nike products.</p><p>This happy dynamic, though, might not last after Nike sells through the last of its excess merchandise. It has a lofty longer-term goal of reaching operating margins in a high-teens percentage, up from 12.5% in the latest quarter. That will probably require more scoring on its own through direct sales rather than passing to wholesale.</p><p>While Nike is likely to emerge from the excess-inventory problem a winner, its hungry wholesale partners might not.</p>",
