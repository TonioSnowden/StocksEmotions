  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Flipping Air Jordans Is  No Longer a Slam Dunk  ----  By Inti Pacheco",
  "text": "<p>   Air Jordans, Nike Dunks and Air Force 1s soared in value last year as investors snapped up basketball-inspired sneakers, hoping to flip them for a profit. The hang time for this market is over. </p><p>   Some of these limited-edition shoes are now reselling for 30% less than just a few months ago as owners unload high-end footwear at reduced prices. A pair of Air Jordans released on July 13 that might have once vanished in minutes took days to sell out from Nike Inc.'s virtual shelves. Average transactions at online sneaker resale marketplace StockX dropped 20% in June. </p><p>   The crash in the limited-edition sneaker market coincides with a downturn in a variety of alternative assets that surged during a 2021 market boom, from meme stocks and cryptocurrencies to nonfungible tokens and sports cards. All of them benefited from forces that converged during the early stages of the pandemic, including government stimulus payments that gave people access to more cash as well as online marketplaces that made it easy for people to trade and research prices. </p><p>   Sneakers attracted new investors who were interested in a quick flip, as well as more hard-core collectors who wanted shoes no one else had. That new demand, along with pandemic-related supply shortages, pushed up prices. The resale market rose to $6 billion in sales annually, according to research firm Cowen &amp; Co., which expects the market to get bigger over the coming decade. </p><p>   The challenge for this market at the moment is that supply exceeds demand, and many investors are pulling back as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, inflation reaches its highest level in more than four decades, and consumers lose confidence in the direction of the economy. </p><p>   \"You don't want prices to go down, but they're going down anyways, just because of how many people are selling in general,\" said Matthew Taffer, a sneaker reseller in Richmond, Va. </p><p>   The average transaction at StockX has declined every month since February compared with the same period last year, according to data from Earnest Research. The average sale at GOAT, another marketplace that allows people to buy and sell limited-edition sneakers, has been declining since at least April. </p><p>   \"Limited supply can drive greater price premiums, while an influx can put downward pressure on prices and make it more of a buyer's market,\" said StockX co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Greg Schwartz. GOAT declined to comment. </p><p>   Consider what happened to the Nike Dunk Low White Black, known as \"Panda\" in the sneaker community, which resold for $290 on StockX in February but is now going for just under $200. Or the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG \"Patent Bred,\" which resold in April for around $300 and is now fetching $230. Prices in the resale market fluctuate depending on the shoe size. </p><p>   \"People are now competing and undercutting one another to get the sale,\" said Tony DeAngelo, who lives in Atlanta and makes YouTube videos about sneakers under the name ToNYD2WiLD. </p><p>   Big shoemakers such as Nike -- which owns the Air Jordan brand and many other styles coveted by so-called sneakerheads -- seed the resale market by regularly issuing limited-edition shoes and deciding where they are sold. The downturn isn't expected to harm Nike, according to Cowen analyst John Kernan, since the secondary-market sales don't contribute to its revenue. Nike reported roughly $3.6 billion in footwear sales for the quarter ended May 31. In June, Nike executives said consumer demand was strong and they felt they would be able to increase list prices. </p><p>   Nike is paying attention to this secondary market, however. In February, the company sued StockX for alleged trademark infringement in the sale of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. In May, as part of an amended complaint in the same lawsuit, it accused StockX of selling fake Nike sneakers. StockX has denied the allegations and says it authenticates the products it resells. </p><p>   A spokesman for another big shoemaker, Adidas AG, said in a statement that it deliberately tries \"not to sell our products to resellers or resale platforms.\" Adidas Yeezys, a series of sneakers released in collaboration with rapper Kanye West, have also been losing value in the resale market. Nike declined to comment. </p><p>   Some hotly anticipated releases of limited-edition shoes still command top dollar. On July 19, Nike released a collaboration with Louis Vuitton, a collection of Air Force 1s designed by the late Virgil Abloh, that quickly sold out. The shoes, which had a starting price of $2,750, have already sold on StockX for more than $11,000. </p><p>   Some investors also say they are not discouraged by a drop in prices. In a video he posted July 10, Mr. DeAngelo said this was the perfect time to buy long-coveted sneakers. He recently purchased a pair of Nike's LeBron 7 \"Fairfax,\" which dropped to $140 this month from a peak of $240 in April. </p><p>   Mr. Taffer, the reseller in Richmond, said he recently bought 25 pairs of Nike's Air Force 1 '07 LX \"UV Reactive,\" which typically resell for about $150 to $200, for an average $110 apiece from someone who needed the cash. He said the person was trying to sell the shoes for about $130. </p><p>   \"If you lowballed an offer, people are more inclined to take that now,\" Mr. Taffer said, because they need the cash. Mr. Taffer, who has been reselling sneakers since 2016, said he plans to open his own physical sneaker store next month. </p><p>   Keith Adam, a New York reseller who runs an organized online reseller community called Endurance, said he thinks the market is experiencing a correction, rather than a full-blown crash. Prices are now closer to where they were in 2019, Mr. Adam said. In 2020 and 2021, he added, the value of some sneakers was absurdly inflated as a consequence of the Fed's monetary policy. \"It was reseller heaven.\" </p><p>   It could take another six to 12 month for the resale market to crash, Mr. Adam said, as the Fed raises interest rates. That doesn't mean there won't be opportunities to invest, he and other sneakerheads said. </p><p>   Profit margins will get smaller, Mr. Taffer said, \"but the money is still going to be there.\" </p><p></p>",
