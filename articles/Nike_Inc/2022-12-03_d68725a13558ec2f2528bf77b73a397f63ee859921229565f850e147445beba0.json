  "text": "<p>It's taken far more than luck to grow a publicly traded global powerhouse from a nearly bankrupt outdoors brand, founded in 1952 in the French mountain village Monestier-de-Clermont. Ruffini, who acquired the Moncler brand in 2003 and took the company public in 2013, is celebrating the brand's 70th anniversary with his characteristic maximalism. When we meet at Moncler's headquarters in Milan on the Monday after his anniversary show, he's still buzzing from the event. With 1,952 performers (symbolic of the company's founding year) moving in unison across the Piazza del Duomo in all-white looks including Moncler Maya 70 puffers and beanies, it was a true spectacle.</p><p>Although the show, mostly open to the public, was beset by a downpour and crowds of jostling onlookers, it was a happening in Milan, with taxi drivers and teenagers chattering about it for days. Leonardo DiCaprio, Colin Kaepernick and Anne Hathaway watched the show in the champagne-popping VIP section, while Ruffini took it in among the audience in the square. He says he wanted to do something strong for Milan—a love letter of sorts to the center of Italian fashion. Ruffini said he hadn't seen the final bill when we spoke, but that the production costs were less than one might think because the main set was already in place: the Duomo cathedral, which dates to the 14th century. But for a company that's been resolutely global for at least a decade, it's crucial that the show's effects are felt everywhere. He says, \"The real cost is the digital marketing, because we have to send this image everywhere around the world\" to Moncler's followers, through social media.</p><p>Today, those Moncler fans span in demographic from the Gstaad grande dame in her buckled jacket at the chalet to the young hypebeast who bought his Craig Green Genius collaboration puffer from Canadian cool-kid retailer Ssense. The Genius series of collaborations, a Ruffini brainchild that began in 2018, continues to bring high-concept fashion and a limited-edition drop mentality to the company. In addition to Green, buzzy collabs have included Simone Rocha, Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, Thom Browne, Rick Owens, Jonathan Anderson, Virgil Abloh and more.</p><p>Although Ruffini says that the strategy has always been to appeal to all generations, he calls Genius the turning point for attracting young customers. They're now responsible for 30 percent of the Moncler Group's sales, which amounted to $916 million in the first half of 2022, up 48 percent from the previous year. Those numbers include Stone Island, the Italian streetwear brand acquired by the group in a two-part deal over late 2020 and early 2021, which valued it at $1.4 billion. Ruffini said that no other acquisitions were on the horizon.</p><p>Looking ahead, Ruffini is bullish on the value of experience—both in-person and digital—to create a community around Moncler. \"You have to be a little bit of a future predictor, if you're talking 2025, 2028,\" he muses. For technology, which changes so quickly, that can be tricky, he admits. But he senses that creating immersive moments in stores, in online videos or elsewhere, like the Duomo happening, will be one path forward. \"I think the luxury world has changed from possession to experience,\" he says.</p><p>He's also looking to expand other categories that make sense for the elevated-outdoors DNA of the brand, including shoes and knitwear. When we met, he'd just come from a shoe meeting with Nike alum Nathan VanHook, Moncler's new head of footwear design, that had him fired up. The quilted Trailgrip Après sneakers, which launched in September 2022 and run $595, are already sold out in most sizes.</p><p>\"We don't want to make product just to sell,\" he says. \"We want to make product to say something to our community, our customer, our people. I think this is the most difficult thing.\"</p><p>He's careful to always stick to the roots of Moncler, which was created to protect cold-weather workers and skiers from the elements: In 1954 it outfitted an Italian expedition to K2. So far, Ruffini feels this approach has served him well. \"I think this is one of the things I'm most proud of: rebuilding the company with a modern approach and a contemporary vision, but remaining close to the history.\"</p><p>Maintaining that uniqueness is key in an elevated-outerwear landscape that's increasingly crowded. There's Chanel's Coco Neige line, Gucci's collaboration with the North Face, Prada's Linea Rossa skiwear, Dior's DiorAlps collection. Giorgio Armani's Neve mountain-wear line will show in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in December, followed by a tour of chichi ski resorts. Ruffini has taken note of the proliferation. \"Basically, any luxury brand: They're our competitor,\" he says.</p><p>As far as other executives who stoke his competitive flame, he mentions Pietro Beccari, the chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, and Patrizio Bertelli, the co-CEO of Prada, as strong rivals. He's impressed by Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard's recent announcement that he was devoting his family's ownership of the company and its profits to fight climate change. \"He was always in front of us, in terms of sustainability,\" he says.</p><p>Edgier retailers such as Ssense help Ruffini reach new audiences. Brigitte Chartrand, Ssense's vice president of womenswear, says that its customers are wearing Moncler on the street and even out to the club. By choosing designers to collaborate with such as Matthew Williams of Givenchy and 1017 Alyx 9SM, Jonathan Anderson for his line JW Anderson, and Rick Owens, whom Chartrand calls \"hero brands for our audience,\" Ruffini has expanded the brand awareness. Chartrand says that the younger Ssense customer saves up to buy Moncler.</p><p>Staying in touch with this new customer is a savvy move for an Italian honcho who has two children in their 30s, Pietro and Romeo, no grandchildren yet and an increasingly unrelatable lifestyle. He owns homes in Como, Italy, and St. Moritz and a 180-foot yacht. He is the portrait of the new Italian elite.</p><p>Leisure has become more important to him, he says, after realizing about five years ago that he was working too hard. \"I think we have to be fresh when you come to the office,\" he explains. Since then, he lives by the mandate: \"Weekend is weekend.\" But his weekends are filled with the kind of ritzy athletic pursuits that fuel his brand. He calls skiing in St. Moritz \"very important,\" and is continually testing new Moncler gear on the slopes.</p><p>Carla Sozzani, the founder of concept store 10 Corso Como, has known Ruffini for nearly 20 years, since around the time that he bought Moncler. She was a bit of a fairy godmother to him in the fashion world, introducing him to the designers Junya Watanabe and Nicolas Ghesquière (then the creative director of Balenciaga), who went on to be two of the earliest Moncler collaborators.</p><p>When Sozzani herself worked with Ruffini on a series of black-and-white printed 10 Corso Como x Moncler coats, they looked at the graphic painting and designs of American artist Kris Ruhs together, and she was impressed by his sensitivity to the work. \"Never mind how big and important he became later, I don't think he ever lost that touch for beauty, which for me is a must,\" she says.</p><p>Sozzani, a close friend and collaborator of Azzedine Alaïa who is now president of the late designer's foundation, also introduced Ruffini and Alaïa in the hopes that they could collaborate. Alaïa liked Ruffini, Sozzani remembers, but then, so does everyone: \"He has good vibrations.\" Although Ruffini sent Alaïa meters of Moncler duvet fabric—which the foundation still has—the collaboration didn't happen before the designer's death in 2017.</p><p>Although Alaïa may be the one that got away, not many potential Geniuses escape Ruffini's clutches. Because Moncler collaborates with several designers a year, he's always looking for new talent and meeting with young creatives. \"It's not obvious because there is a lot of creativity all around the world,\" he says. He is particularly proud of the 2022 Genius collaboration with an unexpected partner, the Chinese designer Dingyun Zhang, who had also worked on Yeezy sneakers and produced some highly original fashion puffers of his own. Because China and Europe were still \"closed\" due to the pandemic during the design process, Ruffini and Zhang did initial meetings and all design by video call.</p><p>Genius contracts are each different, but most offer royalties in addition to the design fee. Along with the money and the creative freedom—both significant—collaborations offer younger designers access to a new audience. Simone Rocha, the Irish designer who was part of the inaugural wave of Geniuses in 2018, says that dipping her toes into athletic wear was an exciting prospect. Plus, the designs were shown at huge fashion presentations in Milan. \"It was impossible for it not to be literally, physically introduced to a lot of people outside of my world,\" she says.</p><p>Rocha, who sees Ruffini often, says, \"He's always looking for newness.\" That hunt for newness extends to his personal life, too. Recently, in addition to skiing, he's taken up mountain biking in St. Moritz, even in the winter (with spikes to grip the ice).</p><p>\"It's my latest passion,\" Ruffini says. \"You have to go up first to come down. But downhill is what I like a lot.\"</p><p>Moncler Invites All of Milan to Honor Its 70 Years of Fashion</p>",
