Crypto-exchange Coinbase COIN fell as did retail trading platform Robinhood HOOD, which last quarter made more than half of its transaction-related revenue from crypto.</p><p>“Equity markets continue to reflect a tug of war between bulls and bears, with markets heading for a mixed week,” wrote Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.</p><p>Friday's lackluster action comes after two strong days of gains for Wall Street stocks following the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday, as investors reacted to indications by the central bank that start of the tapering of its bond purchases might be near.</p><p>Indeed, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said she backed starting tapering of the Fed's monthly purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities starting in November, with an eye toward ending it in the middle of 2022.
