  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion -- 20 Odd Questions: Gabriela Hearst --- Before her fashion shows in New York and Paris, the designer talked magic, mezcal and her go-to chocolates 'in times of need'",
  "text": "<p>\"It's like the life of an athlete, but I sleep eight hours a night. I have an Oura Ring,\" Ms. Hearst said, referring to the trendy sleep tracker. \"Everything in my life is about my passion, my mission and my family. I don't have too many fun nights. Maybe four of those a year, maximum.\"</p><p>Those rare evenings will \"for sure\" include good food. \"I'm Latin, and you cannot come to a place where the food is no good.\" Also, mezcal and \"amazing friends with unpretentious vibes.\"</p><p>Just a few days before her signature brand's New York runway show in February, Ms. Hearst, dressed casually in a beanie of her own design, logged on to Zoom to discuss her love of jewelry, country music and her many \"witchy\" proclivities.</p><p>I consider myself: a witch. I'm the daughter of one. I don't do spells, but I have a wish list. Some people call it visualization. I've used wish lists for years. I get a lot of what I want. I put things out there with my magic and hope people around can make it happen, too.</p><p>If I'm going to drink alcohol: it's going to be mezcal. I like Ilegal and Agua Magica. I love it when they're a little aged and have that golden flavor. It's the drink of witches, if you ask me.</p><p>I just read: \"The Ministry for the Future\" [about climate change]. It's science fiction, but I would call it science prediction. . . . I suffer climate anxiety and I believe fusion energy is a solution for clean energy by 2030. I want to learn everything I can about it.</p><p>I grew up: on a ranch [in Uruguay]. My mom's family has been there for 170 years. She still lives there, off the grid. She used to compete in the rodeo. Then she became a taekwondo black belt. Then she was a Zen Buddhist. She defies structures of how powerful women should behave. I admire her, but she's also embarrassed me. She would pick me up from school in her taekwondo outfit. I spent my teenage years being completely mortified.</p><p>I have always preferred: stationery stores to fashion boutiques. As a kid, my favorite time was when the school year started and we had to buy pens and pencils.</p><p>I drew: 32 sketches for the new Chloe collection on the plane trip back from Paris. I don't know if they're good or bad. I try to keep ego out of the [creativity] equation. I follow where my curiosity drives me.</p><p>I take notes: with [Pilot] pens and I sketch with pencils. I don't like using erasers on the back of pencils so I always have a Caran d'Ache or Faber-Castell eraser. I like classic brands.</p><p>I go through: around seven notebooks a month. For Chloe, I use notebooks from Aspinal of London. For Gabriela Hearst, I use small ones by Fashionary. Inside my notebooks, there will be an article about climate change I cut out, a design note, a drawing that I saw or something that I dreamt and notes about fusion energy.</p><p>Among my favorite hotels are: the Aman Tokyo, the Bristol in Paris and the Carlyle in New York -- the bar is a scene.</p><p>I'm obsessed with: cherries and chocolate. Charbonnel et Walker's dark chocolate [ceri-settes] with cherries and [cherry liqueur] inside are insane. They only sell them in London. They're for special times of need.</p><p>My twin teenage daughters are into: a pinstripe suit I made for the Gabriela Hearst show before Covid. My kids are getting more excited about my closet. I feel like it's a victory.</p><p>One of my coolest garments is: a Manchester United official team Nike shirt that is probably 20 years old.</p><p>On walks, I love listening to: country music. Lately I've been playing \"Sleeping on the Blacktop\" by Colter Wall, \"Clay Pigeons\" by Blaze Foley and music by Ryan Bingham.</p><p>Energetically speaking: it's good to have a stone close to your skin. I [recently] strung ruby beads very simply into a necklace. I like how it feels on my body. I love jewelry. I make these one-ounce rings that have a hidden precious stone. I like things that have secrets.</p><p>My weekly regimen includes: Reiki and acupuncture. My acupuncturist tells me I'm like a Formula One car. He has to calibrate me, and then I'm ready.</p><p>I was a terrible: model. At 21, I was already too old. I looked very androgynous. I shaved my head, and I liked that people could confuse me with a guy. Modeling taught me rejection. Most of the time you don't get the gigs.</p><p>I was also not a good: actress. I studied acting for two years at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Acting teaches you to be honest, to reach for authenticity all the time. I couldn't do my job without that training.</p><p>I've been watching: \"Yellowstone.\" I understand these people: It's about ranch life.</p><p>I'm a very: impulsive person, so I use the Osho Zen Tarot app to slow myself down. I ask it, Should I post this picture on Instagram? Should I send this email? But is it the universe or the algorithm talking to me? I'm doubtful. I'm going to buy an actual tarot deck instead.</p><p>A few years ago, I discovered: the skin-care brand Biologique Recherche, and I've stuck with it. I use the Lotion P50 and La Grand Creme. Sometimes I'll get a facial from Sarah Smith in New York. She's a master.</p><p>My dream dinner party would include: the young Bob Dylan. He was so sexy. And I'd love to have Miles Davis but he wouldn't come, unless I also invited Jimi Hendrix -- [Davis] went to his funeral. I'd make sure the alcohol was good. I think they'd like picking food, tapas style.</p><p>-- Edited from an interview by Marshall Heyman</p>",
