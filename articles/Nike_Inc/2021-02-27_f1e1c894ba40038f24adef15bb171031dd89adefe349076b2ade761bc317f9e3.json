  "title": "8 gilets to bring out your inner farmer",
  "text": "<p>I have started to dress more like an urban farmer than a fashion writer. My day-to-day look now consists of heavy boots, knitted jumpers and the pièce de résistance — a gilet. As functionality takes growing precedence in our wardrobes, this unisex layering piece is coming into its own. It jazzes up boring sweaters and shirts on Zoom calls, smartens up activewear, and helps winter garb transition into spring, fitting snugly under trenchcoats and waxed jackets on misty morning walks.</p> <p>It seems others share in my newfound obsession. At fashion search engine Lyst, searches for gilets have risen 81 per cent year-on-year, with some of the most searched-for styles for men and women being Canada Goose's Garson quilted gilet, Moncler's Liane quilted shell gilet, The North Face's 1996 Retro Nuptse down gilet and Nike's Aerolayer running vest.&#xa0;</p> <p>When it comes to styling, (almost) anything goes: take a page from Prada's autumn/winter 2020 menswear catwalk and pair a slick black nylon gilet with suiting separates. For women, a structured quilted gilet looks terrific over an ankle-skimming skirt and heavy boots. On Zoom, opt for contrast. Style a floral or printed shirt with a solid-coloured gilet to make your print pop. Chunky gold jewellery can add a little glitz. </p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
