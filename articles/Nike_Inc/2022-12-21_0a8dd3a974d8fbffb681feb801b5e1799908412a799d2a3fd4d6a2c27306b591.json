NKE and FedEx Corporation FDX, with hopes that corporate earnings may be better than feared even during a potential economic downturn. The sporting-goods retailer reported quarterly earnings and sales which were solidly higher than Wall Street expected, supported by a rebound of business in China and improving inventory levels due to strong consumer demand.</p><p>Nike shares jumped 13.5%, leading Dow gainers and on pace for its largest percentage increase since June 25, 2021, when it rose 15.53%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers' chief strategist thinks the stock-market rally indicates that investors have finally digested the Federal Reserve's message from last week.The \"triple-whammy\" of better-than-expected earnings from FedEx and Nike and the positive consumer sentiment offer \"substantive reasons\" to be hopeful.</p><p>But Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, expressed caution over the stock market's sharp move higher Wednesday.</p><p>\"These moves that you see today are just head fakes,\" Lloyd said in a phone interview. \"There's less volume\" in trading heading into the end of the year, leading to exaggerated moves in the market, he said.</p><p>\"The problem is the economy really is fundamentally much weaker,\" and earnings may have to drop \"a lot more,\" said Lloyd, adding that he's expecting a recession in 2023.</p><p>See: Wall Street's stock-market forecasts for 2022 were off by the widest margin since 2008: Will next year be any different?</p><p>Markets have also brushed aside a surprise monetary shift by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday, when it raised the yield at which it allows the country's 10-year government bond to trade. The move has been viewed by some investors as a first step toward the bank ending its era of ultra easy monetary policy, though BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda described the measure as neither a tightening nor a move toward the exit.</p><p>Read: Why the Bank of Japan's surprise policy twist rattled global financial markets</p><p>The Dow, meanwhile, was pressing up against an important resistance level on its price chart, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com, in a note.</p><p>\"At the time of writing, the Dow was testing key resistance around 33,400 area,\" which had served as the last major support level on the chart before the Dow broke down last week, he wrote (see chart above). \"Once support, could it now turn into strong resistance leading to a big selloff?\"</p><p>If resistance holds, the chart watcher said he would expect to see a drop back to the high of Tuesday's range around 33,000. \"And if that level fails to offer support, then there is a possibility we will see a revisit of the week's low, which at 32,500 happens to be where the 200-day average comes into play,\" he said. \"However, if resistance at 33,400 breaks convincingly, then that would end the renewed bearish bias.\"</p><p>See: Is a 2023 stock-market rebound in store after 2022 selloff?
