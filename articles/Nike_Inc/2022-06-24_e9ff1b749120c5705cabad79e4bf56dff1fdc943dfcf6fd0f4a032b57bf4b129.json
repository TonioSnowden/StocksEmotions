  "text": "<p>Richardson's failure to advance past the first heat in her top event continues a year-long fall from the heights of last summer, when she briefly appeared poised to become one of the top U.S. sprinters in years. She has raced only sparingly since then, without much success, and lately has taken aim at the drug-testing body that oversees the process that kept her out of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</p><p>Richardson also is entered in the 200 meters, whose first round is Saturday. But the 100 meters has been her signature event. Her stunning failure to advance will keep the most closely followed track star in the U.S. from getting a second chance to compete for a world title in the event.</p><p>Richardson jogged past reporters Thursday and did not participate in post-race interview sessions.</p><p>Via email Thursday night Richardson's agent, Renaldo Nehemiah, wrote, \"At the moment, I have no comments on her race today.\"</p><p>Richardson emerged in 2021 as one of the most riveting stars in the sport.</p><p>Nike has featured Richardson's colorful outfits and bespoke fingernails in its ads, and more than 2 million people follow her frequent postings on social media. In a nation that racks up Olympic track and field medals but recently has lacked a breakout star, Richardson became one nearly overnight.</p><p>But her ascent was disrupted when a positive drug test for a chemical found in marijuana at the U.S. trials eradicated her breakout victory in the 100 and prevented her from competing in the event in Tokyo.</p><p>Richardson entered and then withdrew from several races earlier this year. Her Thursday result continues a string of uneven performances. Last August at the Prefontaine Classic, in a race against the three medalists from the Tokyo Olympics, Richardson finished last in 11.14 seconds. That lagged behind her U.S. trials-winning time of 10.86 and trailed far back from her personal best of 10.72, set in April 2021.</p><p>Richardson seemed to be on the upswing at the NYC Grand Prix meet earlier this month, where she finished second in 10.85 seconds in the 100 meters and won the 200 meters in 22.38. After Richardson's races, crowds of screaming young runners greeted h​​er as she signed autographs.</p><p>In the days leading up to Thursday's preliminary race in Eugene, however, Richardson posted cryptic messages to her verified Twitter account with references to her suspension and drug-testing.</p><p>Last Saturday, she made a reference to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, writing, \"Once again@usantidoping give us all these rules but can not follow themselves. Stop giving us rules that y'all can bend just to get more money. The ones behind the desk who probably has never been a high level athlete need to be held accountable at the same level as the athletes!\"</p><p>Travis T. Tygart, CEO of USADA, said in a statement, \"We are hoping to speak with her again soon to listen to and understand her concerns and help in any way possible. Everything we do, as is our mission and duty, is to honor the rules and protect clean athletes.\"</p><p>USADA includes former athletes among its leadership. Its board chair is Philip Dunn, a three-time Olympic racewalker, and its chair emeritus is Edwin Moses, the three-time Olympic medal-winning and former world record-holding 400-meter hurdler.</p><p>On Tuesday, Richardson retweeted a video of the interview she gave to NBC's \"Today\" show last July 2, when she spoke about her doping suspension. She added the comment, \"I wish I never did this. I wish I had the choice when it was time for me to tell my story.\"</p><p>In that interview, Richardson acknowledged using marijuana, spoke of the pressure she was under to perform and said she was in pain after having recently learned of the death of her biological mother.</p><p>In his Thursday email, Richardson's agent wrote, \"As it relates to the tweets, I haven't spoken to her about them and will not speculate as to her thoughts.\"</p><p>Richardson's suspension last summer only seemed to make her more popular—whether for her confidence and individual style, or the fact that marijuana is increasingly legal in states across the U.S.</p><p>In the wake of her suspension, WADA announced it was re-examining the presence of cannabis on its prohibited-substances list. It hasn't yet announced its findings.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Sha'Carri Richardson Fails to Qualify for World Championships in the 100</p>",
