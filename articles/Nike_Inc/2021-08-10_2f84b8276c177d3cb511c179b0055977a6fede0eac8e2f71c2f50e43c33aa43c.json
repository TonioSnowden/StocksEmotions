  "text": "<p>Mr. Zeidan reverted to the unconventional drills of his high-school soccer days in Minnesota. In the dead of winter, his coach would rent a basketball court and cram 20 players onto it.</p><p>\"He'd play disco and jazz on a boom box and make us play with the ball at our feet with choreographed moves to the beat,\" Mr. Zeidan recalls. \"We'd do one drill until the music track was over, then he'd yell out the next drill. We'd practice for hours.\"</p><p>An amateur DJ, Mr. Zeidan started making hourlong quarantine mixes. Each week he'd \"play\" soccer to a different mix on his terrace.</p><p>\"I'd touch the ball between my feet to the beat, and when the rhythm changed or beat dropped, I'd do a quick turn and then go back to passing the ball between my feet, almost like dancing,\" he says.</p><p>Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Mr. Zeidan says soccer helped him build confidence as a boy.</p><p>\"It was an outlet for me to fit into a culture I didn't organically fit into,\" he says. A midfielder in his teens, he converted to a defender after tearing a knee ligament in a high-school match. He went on to play briefly at Johns Hopkins University, a Division III team, until he tore the ligament again, ending his collegiate career.</p><p>He struggled after college to find a safe way to reintegrate soccer into his life. \"When you play in an adult league, everyone wants to relive their glory days, and it can get quite aggressive,\" he says.</p><p>Rather than risk injury, he got creative and found new ways to weave soccer into his workouts, such as dribbling the ball on long runs and using his head, knees and feet to keep the ball off the ground to the beat of music.</p><p>Now if he does the foot touches while at the gym, he gets some strange stares. \"I've also gotten a few phone numbers,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Zeidan tries to exercise seven days a week. Two-to-three days a week, he wakes up by doing 30 minutes of musically choreographed soccer touches on his terrace, at the gym or outside.</p><p>He is an avid runner and aims to log at least 100 miles a month. He splits his time between Miami and Brooklyn, N.Y., and has a 5-mile loop he runs in each city.</p><p>Also a former high school swimmer, he still loves to get in the water. His apartment in Miami has a rooftop pool where he tries to swim 1,000 meters using a freestyle stroke once every two weeks. He practices yoga daily.</p><p>He bought an inflatable paddleboard last year, which he uses on weekends. He paddles from Virginia Key through open ocean to Fisher Island and back, which his watch logs as about 2.6 miles.</p><p>He has an Equinox gym in his Miami apartment building and takes spin classes there twice a week.</p><p>\"I should probably do more strength training,\" he says. \"I will throw in some push-ups between ball touches or after a run.\" When in Brooklyn, he occasionally jumps into pickup soccer matches in McCarren Park.</p><p>He's a Nike loyalist and buys the brand's React Infinity Run Flyknit sneakers for running ($160), Nike Free RN Flyknit sneakers for soccer ($120) and Flight soccer ball ($160).</p><p>Mr. Zeidan bought an Apple Watch Nike Series 6 ($400) during lockdown.</p><p>\"It's my favorite gadget,\" he says. \"I started using Nike's Audio Guided Runs. A little voice helps push you through a 10K. I don't like fake encouragement, so I was skeptical, but it really motivates me.\"</p><p>\"It takes effort to create great mixes,\" he says. In addition to curating his own playlists, he also follows DJ Folamour. \"His high-energy disco mixes push me through workouts,\" he says. When he runs, he puts on DJ Mashrik. \"His deep house tracks have the perfect beat to pace me for an hour,\" he says.</p><p>---</p><p>What's your workout?

Even if you aren't a recreational athlete, these drills will help build agility and coordination while spicing up your typical workout routine.</p><p>Self-Passing a Ball Against a Wall</p><p>Find a wall, preferably 10 feet by 10 feet or greater, and practice passing a soccer ball off the wall at various angles.</p><p>\"Although seemingly a simple drill, this can help with accuracy and overall agility,\" Dr. Jagim says. Practice with both legs. For an additional challenge, he suggests marking one or multiple Xs on the wall. Aim for them with each pass. \"The farther away from the wall, the more difficult the drill becomes.\"</p><p>This drill can be done for a set number of passes or for time. It can also be performed with a tennis ball to focus on throwing accuracy.</p><p>Rotational Circuit With Medicine Ball</p><p>\"Medicine-ball throws are a great exercise for core strength, explosiveness, lower-body power and stability,\" Dr. Jagim says. This three-exercise circuit will benefit athletes who play sports that require the body to twist, such as baseball, softball, tennis or golf players. He notes it's better to start with a lighter-weight ball and slowly progress.</p><p>Overhead Slams</p><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees and hips slightly bent. Hold a medicine ball at your torso. Engage your core as you squat down, then in one powerful motion rise up on the balls of your feet as you lift the medicine ball almost straight overhead. Then slam the ball down between your legs as you lower back into a squat. Repeat eight to 10 slams.</p><p>Reverse Overhead Throw</p><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees and hips slightly bent. Hold a medicine ball at your torso. Engage your core as you squat down, then explosively throw the ball behind and over your head, trying to throw it as far as possible. Repeat eight to 10 times.</p><p>Side Rotational Throw Left and Right</p><p>Stand 2 to 3 feet from a wall, with shoulders perpendicular to it. Keep your arms long and elbows slightly bent, and have the inside hand under the ball and the outside hand behind the ball. Throw the ball as hard as you can at the wall three to five times on each side.</p><p>---</p><p>His Mostly Vegetarian Diet Includes</p><p>Healthy Doses of Nutritional Yeast</p><p>Philosophy: \"I try to be mindful about how what I eat impacts my body as well as the environment,\" Mr. Zeidan says. He largely practices a vegetarian diet, though he eats eggs and occasionally sneaks meat into a meal.</p><p>Protein source: He sprinkles nutritional yeast on almost everything he eats. \"It tastes like Parmesan cheese,\" he says.</p><p>Breakfast: Two hard-boiled eggs with raw spinach and sliced tomatoes.</p><p>Staple meals: Spinach salad with lemon juice and nutritional yeast or a vegan Daily Harvest bowl of vegetables and grains.</p><p>Snack: Honeycrisp apples</p><p>Splurge: \"I reserve the right to eat a piece of pizza or a burger once a month,\" he says. \"The occasion is usually correlated with when I'm drinking wine.\"</p>",
