  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion -- On Trend: How Granddad's Shoes Got Cool",
  "text": "<p>In 2021, practical walking shoes are being curiously co-opted by spry 20- and 30-somethings. What footwear falls into this category? Anything that you could pilfer from a retirement-home denizen: for example, the outdoorsy Merrell Jungle Moc with its tractioned rubber sole; Keen's springy, elasticized Uneek sandal; and the extremely gray Journey Mesh sneaker made by 45-year-old American brand San Antonio Shoemakers, which boasts a \"Tripad Technology\" shock-absorbing sole.</p><p>Men have long sought comfort from their shoes, but the pandemic has led them to prioritize comfort over presentability or panache. When your date calendar has been wiped clean, you're going to rely more on your mushy, errand-run Merrells than your polished Allen Edmonds loafers. \"People just want to be a little bit more cozy. I think that practicality is what people are gravitating toward right now,\" said Stefano Gugliotta, 29, a Florida-based social media manager for a national chain of car dealerships who also runs @obscuresneakers, an Instagram account with nearly 75,000 followers that pays homage to little-known shoes.</p><p>Early on, his account featured Avia high-top basketball shoes from the 1980s and long-forgotten Adidas tennis shoes, but lately he's been mixing in images of plush Subu slip-ons, curvaceous Teva sandals and hard-to-find Oakley mules. By featuring these functional, gorpcore-ish shoes, Mr. Gugliotta is capturing a shift toward footwear that is decidedly unprecious. These are not Jordans you have to polish with a toothbrush, or Air Force Ones you'd baby so as to not crease the leather. These are practical shoes you can put through the wringer.</p><p>Not everyone understands why geriatric walking shoes are catching on with a more limber generation, though. Recently, Ryan Chang, 32, a writing professor in Los Angeles, went to his local SAS store to buy Journey sneakers, which look a little like New Balance shoes minus the logo. After Mr. Chang asked to try them on, the salesperson shot him what he called a \"puzzled look.\" Apparently, men with as few grays as he has rarely request Journeys for themselves. Regardless, Mr. Chang cherishes his new pair.</p><p>For millennials and Gen Z, that these sensible shoes are an atypical choice is central to their appeal. The trend is a descendant of normcore, the 2010s phenomenon of dressing in banal clothes that bucked prevailing styles. Mr. Wright of Manchester noted that if he laced up his Mephistos and took a walk through town he might see one other person wearing the doughy leather lace-ups. Aside from their easy-on-the-knees comfort (vital for Mr. Wright, a runner training for his first marathon) this humble shoe's relative scarcity is a \"big bonus,\" he said.</p><p>The sneaker market is also tremendously overloaded and overhyped these days, which has some shoppers falling back on these reliable, restrained shoes. David Mendoza, 21, a bank teller in San Francisco, explained that with sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas releasing so many new and heavily designed models, his eyes often just glaze over. \"I see a sneaker, and [I think] 'Oh that's nice.' But I don't need it anymore.\" Instead, he depends on time-tested Clarks Wallabees and New Balance models like the 990, which have the added benefit of keeping his feet from aching after a long shift of manning the bank counter.</p><p>Buying fewer, enduring shoes, rather than frequently snatching up new models, is certainly a more financially prudent way to stock one's closet. Savione Wright, 23, a program manager at a technology company in Redmond, Wash., purchased his first pair of Merrells a few years ago, after seeking out a more minimal, sensible shoe. Their high comfort quotient and diminutive price (about $85) were both huge pluses for Mr. Wright, who was used to shelling out around $160 for fashionable, but not necessarily comfortable, Jordans. He recalled wondering why he spent so much money on Nikes. With Merrells he not only saves but gets a shoe that feels good.</p>",
