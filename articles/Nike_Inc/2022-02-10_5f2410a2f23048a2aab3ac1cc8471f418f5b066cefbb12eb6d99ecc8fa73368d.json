He was a former Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. executive.</p><p>See our WSJ profile of John Foley</p><p>Who is criticizing Mr. Foley?</p><p>Blackwells Capital LLC pushed Peloton's board to fire Mr. Foley and pursue a sale, according to the letter Blackwells made public on Jan. 24. In the letter, the firm expressed concerns about the \"performance and direction\" of the company, and the \"ongoing failures of its leadership team.\" The firm also said it believed that Peloton could be an attractive acquisition target for larger technology or fitness-oriented companies.</p><p>Following Peloton's CEO change, Blackwells reiterated its call on Mr. Foley, saying he should leave the company entirely rather than become executive chairman. The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 23 reported that Blackwells had acquired a stake in Peloton of less than 5%.</p><p>In January, Mr.Foley said the company would be reviewing the size of its workforce and resetting production levels as the company adapts to more seasonal demand for its exercise equipment.</p><p>What's the latest on Peloton's response?</p><p>On Feb. 8, Peloton said its digital subscribers fell nearly 3% sequentially—a primary lead generation channel for its business—worse than Wall Street's estimates.</p><p>Peloton said on Feb. 8 that it was starting a major cost-cutting initiative in an effort to take its business from a growth phase to one of consistent profitability. As part of the initiative, the company plans to cut about 20% of its corporate head count.</p><p>Who is Barry McCarthy, Peloton's new CEO?</p><p>Peloton announced that Mr. McCarthy, 68, the former chief financial officer of Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc., will become CEO and president and join Peloton's board.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy retired in 2019 as the chief financial officer of Spotify, where he spent five years and oversaw the company's unusual direct stock listing and led its global ad business. For more than a decade, he served as CFO at Netflix before leaving in 2010, and helped that company shift from a focus on mailing DVDs to launching a streaming service.</p><p>This will be his first role as CEO of a public company.</p><p>How many people were laid off?</p><p>The company said on Feb. 8 it was cutting 2,800 corporate jobs in response to falling demand and growing losses.</p><p>Peloton's fitness instructors won't face layoffs amid the company's recent cutbacks.</p><p>According to the Peloton website, the company employs more than50 instructors.</p><p>Some laid-off employees are joining efforts to find new employment after the fitness company cut 2,800 jobs.</p><p>Several employees posted testimonials on social media of their employment experiences at the fitness company. Some included resumes, others shared the hashtag #opentowork.</p><p>Have there been talks about a potential sale of Peloton?</p><p>The company has drawn interest from potential suitors including Amazon.com Inc. and Nike Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Amazon has been speaking to advisers about a potential deal, according to some of the people. There is no guarantee the e-commerce giant will follow through with an offer or that Peloton would be receptive.</p><p>Other potential suitors are circling, these people said, but no deal is imminent and there may not be one at all.</p><p>What is Peloton's market value?</p><p>Peloton's market capitalization is about $12.5 billion. That is based on its current stock price of around $38 multiplied by all of the company's shares outstanding. Peloton's value has fluctuated wildly since its 2019 IPO as its stock soared in 2020 and then collapsed in late 2021. At its high around a year ago, the New York company had a market value of $50 billion. In early February 2022, it had fallen to around $8 billion.</p><p>(This article may be updated.)</p><p>Write to editors@example.com</p><p>What's Happening With Peloton as a New CEO Steps In</p>",
