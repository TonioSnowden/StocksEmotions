  "title": "China's Pandemic Measures Disrupt Business --- Stringent lockdowns close factories, clog ports, create production hitches as cases climb",
  "text": "<p>Since late December, officials have taken measures to counter Covid-19 outbreaks in several Chinese cities, including the eastern port of Tianjin, Xi'an in central China, and the southern technology hub of Shenzhen. The world's third-busiest container port of Ningbo-Zhoushan, south of Tianjin, risks worsening backlogs from restrictions on trucks and warehouse operations after more than two dozen Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the surrounding area.</p><p>Chinese authorities are adhering to the same playbook that curtailed initial outbreaks and caused intermittent disruptions to production and supply chains. The potential consequences are more severe this time, economists warn, because of the highly contagious nature of Omicron. The variant is hitting the country ahead of the Winter Olympic Games, which are set to begin Feb. 4.</p><p>\"The risk posed by the Omicron variant is that we could take a huge step back in terms of supply-chain bottlenecks,\" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC. \"This time, the situation could be even more challenging than last year, given China's increasingly significant role in global supply.\"</p><p>Several economists said China might escalate its containment policy and some have touted the possibility of a nationwide lockdown. Goldman Sachs cut China's 2022 growth forecast on Tuesday to 4.3% from 4.8% in light of the latest Covid-19 developments.</p><p>Toyota Motor Corp. said operations on Monday and Tuesday at its joint-venture factory in Tianjin came to a halt because of mass testing requirements imposed across the city. About 14 million residents in Tianjin, an industrial hub in northeastern China that accounts for 1.7% of China's exports, were tested after two Omicron cases were detected.</p><p>A Volkswagen plant based in the city was also closed, Stephan Wollenstein, the auto maker's China chief executive, said Tuesday. The German car maker recently also closed a plant in Ningbo, a port city in eastern China, after another small Covid-19 outbreak, he said. He said that in many cases, Chinese authorities have brought local outbreaks under control in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We are monitoring very carefully what's happening over there because Omicron has the potential to significantly change the picture in China compared to 2020 and 2021,\" Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus SE, the world's largest plane manufacturer, said on Monday. He said there haven't been any supply disruptions in the country.</p><p>Western consumers and retailers have become more dependent on China since the start of the pandemic for products, and China's trade surplus is expected to have hit a record, by value, in 2021. The risk is that \"over the coming months we'll experience the 'mother of all supply-chain' stumbles: an Omicron-driven stall in factory Asia,\" Mr. Neumann said.</p><p>Two of the world's largest memory-chip makers have experienced problems in Xi'an, where the local government put in place strict pandemic restrictions starting Dec. 23. South Korea-based Samsung Electronics is having trouble getting enough employees where they are needed because of the city's restrictions on residents leaving home, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>A Samsung spokeswoman referred to an earlier statement saying the company would take all necessary measures to ensure customers aren't affected by what it described as an adjustment to its Xi'an operations.</p><p>U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc. said in late December the lockdown in Xi'an had reduced its workforce at its site in the city, affecting output of its DRAM memory-chip products.</p><p>In Ningbo, Shenzhou International Group, a supplier to global sports brands including Nike, Adidas and Fast Retailing Co.'s Uniqlo, said some production sites were locked down from Jan. 3 after 10 cases were detected in Ningbo's Beilun district. As of Monday, part of the production has resumed operations, it said.</p><p>If the Omicron variant spreads across Asia more widely, economists said it could add to rising inflation and potentially prompt central banks such as the Fed to accelerate tightening of monetary policy.</p><p>Within China, the economic risks of sticking with strict Covid-19-related restrictions are growing. In Nantong, a city in China's eastern Jiangsu province, Mei Wenlong, owner of an electrical-equipment factory, said Omicron-related disruptions could spill over to his suppliers in coming weeks. His factory, with 40-plus employees, was among those in the region hit by a temporary power crunch last fall.</p><p>\"Omicron hasn't affected us much, but they could come sooner than expected,\" Mr. Mei said. \"There's not much you can do. We'll learn to deal with it when it comes.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
