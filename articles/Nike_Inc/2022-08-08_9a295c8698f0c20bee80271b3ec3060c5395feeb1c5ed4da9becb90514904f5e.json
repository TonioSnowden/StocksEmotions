  "title": "Allyson Felix Is Retiring (for Real This Time); After a highly decorated running career, the Olympian looks forward to spending more time with her daughter focusing on other projects: \"I'm just going to have to continue to do the work.\"",
  "text": "<p>With the worlds behind her, Felix, who holds more medals than any American track-and-field athlete in history, insists her exit is real this time. She is looking forward to training less, eating more of what she wants and taking her daughter, Camryn, 3, to her gymnastics and soccer practices.</p><p>The ability to focus on being a parent is a different kind of victory for Felix, who three years ago made waves with a New York Times opinion piece criticizing her former sponsor Nike for its maternity policy. (Nike announced a new and expanded policy a few months after publication, following widespread criticism. The company said in a statement that it \"will continue to champion, celebrate, and evolve to support female athletes.\")</p><p>In addition to spending more time with family, Felix will still be working on her women's sneaker brand, Saysh, and serving on boards of organizations including the nonprofit &amp;Mother, which supports female athletes in their pursuit of motherhood, and the platform Voice in Sport, where women athletes share their keys to success.</p><p>Here, Felix talks to WSJ. about journaling, her legacy as an athlete and the power of a hot bubble bath.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays, and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>I usually get up around 6:30. I write in my gratitude journal and set intentions for the week. It's my calm before the chaos gets going.</p><p>Are you one of those \"Four hours a night is all I need!\" people with sleep, or do you need a minimum to recharge?</p><p>Being an athlete, I'm used to getting a lot of sleep. Getting a good eight hours, getting a nap during the day. But ever since I've had my daughter, it's totally changed. If I can get six hours in, that's really good.</p><p>What do you eat for breakfast to start the week off right?</p><p>Usually it's a smoothie or a bowl of oatmeal, something light and easy.</p><p>At what time of the day or week are you most creative or productive?</p><p>In the evenings. That's the time where I feel energized, whether I'm doing some work or even getting some time alone, it's the time I know is going to be uninterrupted.</p><p>How are you thinking about retirement and your legacy? How are you feeling right now, being in this unique place where you went out of it and back into it?</p><p>I've had a lot of friends who have said it's really difficult, as you transition into this new phase of life. I know that I have the things I'm really passionate about, especially Saysh. The day-to-day, not having the structure of the training and the specific goals, will be difficult. A lot of it has to do with identity and it being so tied to what I've done for the last 20 years. I'm just going to have to continue to do the workâ€”to know that my identity is not just in what I've done and my accomplishments in the past, but really being fulfilled by what's to come in the future.</p><p>As a board member for a nonprofit that supports athlete moms, what are the most pressing issues you're working on and thinking about right now?</p><p>Coming off the heels of having to compete and travel with my daughter, it's being able to offer childcare for athletes and families and for it to be accessible. We were able to bring childcare to our national championships and offer that for everyone involved in the event for free. I would love for it to be the standard in track and field and even further outside the sport as well.</p><p>What have you learned from working with other apparel and footwear companies that you took into founding and running Saysh?</p><p>It was really just about my experience of not feeling valued and not feeling like my worth was seen. I think it boils down to being authentic and genuine and real. We exist for a much bigger purpose than building shoes, we believe that the world needs better companies and companies that see and support women holistically.</p><p>What have you been reading and watching lately?</p><p>Michelle Obama's book Becoming is one of my favorites. As I've been thinking about retirement and transitioning and everything, I've revisited that book. I haven't seen anything new lately, but I love coming back to The Office and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, just some classics for me.</p><p>What do you do for self-care and to relax?</p><p>Anytime that I can, I take a hot bubble bath at the end of the day. It's time where I can just kind of unwind, where no one is bothering me, and I really look forward to those moments. And then anytime away as well. I think it's really important to be able to step away when I need to: if I'm feeling overwhelmed, or if I just need help, if I need my husband to step in and allow me for a couple hours to relax or even to take a nap. Lately, I feel like that's been the thing.</p><p>What's one piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>A lot of times, you're so focused on success. But there's so much to learn from the moments that don't go right, the moments of defeat and picking yourself up. Those are the moments where you grow and where you stretch yourself.</p><p>Is there an example you wouldn't mind sharing?</p><p>In 2008, I had my second Olympics and I got my second silver medal. I felt so disappointed, devastated. I felt almost paralyzed by the failure of it all. I wasn't sure if I still wanted to do this, if I could move forward. But if I didn't go through that moment, I don't know if I would have been successful after it.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Allyson Felix Is Retiring (for Real This Time)</p>",
