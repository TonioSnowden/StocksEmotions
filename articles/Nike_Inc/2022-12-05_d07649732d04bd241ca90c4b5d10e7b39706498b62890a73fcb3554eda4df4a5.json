  "text": "<p>Mr. Irving, 30 years old, was initially suspended by the Brooklyn Nets for at least five games without pay after he tweeted a link to a movie containing false conspiracies about Jews and was slow to disavow holding anti-Semitic beliefs. Mr. Irving has apologized for posting links to the documentary online and he returned to the court in late November after missing eight games.</p><p>The Athletic earlier reported on Nike's status with Mr. Irving.</p><p>In a statement last month Nike said there was no place for hate speech at the company and condemned any form of anti-Semitism. \"We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the situation and its impact on everyone,\" the company said.</p><p>A representative for Mr. Irving didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Nike's relationship with Mr. Irving had been strained since at least last year, when the player said on social media that he wasn't happy with one of the designs for his shoes and that Nike was releasing it without his approval.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Nike Parts Ways With Kyrie Irving</p>",
