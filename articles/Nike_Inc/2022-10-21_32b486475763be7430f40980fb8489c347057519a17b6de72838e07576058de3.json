  "title": "Kidder Peabody CEO Ralph DeNunzio, Surrounded by Giants, Gave Up Firm's Independence; Fast-rising executive, who has died at age 90, arranged a sale to GE as investment bank ran short of capital",
  "text": "<p>He rose to chief executive of Kidder in 1980. While more aggressive firms feasted on profits from rapid-fire trading and financing of takeovers, Mr. DeNunzio proceeded cautiously. By 1985, Kidder was short on capital, and some star bankers were defecting. In April 1986, Mr. DeNunzio sold an 80% stake in Kidder to General Electric Co. for about $600 million. He had tears in his eyes when he informed Kidder's board of the decision to give up independence.</p><p>A year later GE ousted Mr. DeNunzio as CEO amid a scandal over insider trading. Though Mr. DeNunzio wasn't accused of wrongdoing, the scandal exposed lapses in supervision. A few months later, Mr. DeNunzio gave up his post as chairman. He was 55 years old and had time for a second career as a corporate director.</p><p>Mr. DeNunzio died of heart failure Oct. 17 at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 90.</p><p>\"We probably should have moved faster to build our capital,\" Mr. DeNunzio told the New York Times shortly after the sale to GE. \"We were looking more like a middle-sized firm in a land of giants.\"</p><p>Max Chapman, a senior Kidder executive, said: \"I felt like we were falling further and further behind. We told Ralph that we just had to address the capital question.\"</p><p>For GE, Kidder proved costly and embarrassing. In 1994, after a bond-trading scandal and losses on mortgage-backed securities, GE sold Kidder to PaineWebber Group Inc. Kidder's name was retired, ending a history dating to 1865, when Henry Kidder, Francis Peabody and Oliver Peabody established the investment bank.</p><p>More Obituaries</p><p>* Charles A.

His father owned an apartment building in Bronxville, N.Y. His mother had worked as a hat model. He graduated from the Fordham Preparatory School. At Princeton, he majored in classics and mastered Latin. He was a supporter of liberal-arts education even when others saw M.B.A. degrees as almost mandatory for job seekers on Wall Street.</p><p>While at Princeton, he served as a sportscaster for a campus radio station and considered making that his career. As a fan, he continued to relish the intricacies of football and other sports. The Wall Street Journal said he looked \"more like a football coach than an investment banker.\"</p><p>At Kidder, he soon caught the attention of Albert H. Gordon, the chairman, who had rescued the company from financial distress in the early 1930s and ran it for decades. Mentored by Mr. Gordon, Mr. DeNunzio served as an institutional salesman and later as a syndicate manager. By the late 1960s, he was Mr. Gordon's heir apparent. Mr. DeNunzio had to struggle for years to emerge as Kidder's top leader, finally eclipsing Mr. Gordon, an exceptionally fit man who was known to walk from airports to downtown hotels, ran marathons in his 80s and died in 2009 at the age of 107.</p><p>Mr. DeNunzio was proud of his role in persuading Congress in 1970 to help reimburse customers of failed firms. Normally, he said, \"this industry has a hard time agreeing on anything.\"</p><p>In 1987, many on Wall Street were surprised by GE's choice of Silas S. Cathcart, a former chairman of Illinois Tool Works Inc., to succeed Mr. DeNunzio as Kidder's CEO. One Kidder official quipped: \"I was thinking just the other day that what we need in here is a good tool-and-die man.\"</p><p>After leaving Kidder, Mr. DeNunzio was a longtime director of companies including Nike Inc., FedEx Corp. and Harris Corp. He served as captain on family yacht trips between Connecticut, Florida and the Bahamas.</p><p>In 1954, Mr. DeNunzio married Jean Ames. She dropped out of the College of Mount Saint Vincent to raise a family but after her children were grown completed her economics degree in 1980. She died in 2020. Mr. DeNunzio is survived by three sons and eight grandchildren. His philanthropy included gifts to Princeton and the College of Mount Saint Vincent.</p><p>Write to James R.
