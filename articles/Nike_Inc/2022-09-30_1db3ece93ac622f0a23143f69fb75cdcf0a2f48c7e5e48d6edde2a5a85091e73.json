  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 35 points, or 0.1%, to 29,190.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX climbed 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3,644.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 41 points, or 0.4%, to 10,779.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 458 points, or 1.54%, to 29,226, the S&amp;P 500 declined 79 points, or 2.11%, to 3,640, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 314 points, or 2.84%, to 10,738, as all three benchmarks erased</p><p>So far, the S&amp;P 500 has slumped 3.8% in the third quarter and lost 24% over the last three quarters.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>In keeping with the historical pattern, U.S. stocks suffered during the month of September as an assertive Federal Reserve helped push Treasury yields and the dollar higher, which in turn undermined equity valuations.</p><p>See: It's the worst September for stocks since 2008. What that means for October.</p><p>But as the month drew to a close on Friday, investors focused on the personal consumption expenditure inflation index for August, which showed that core consumer prices climbed by 0.6% last month, more than Wall Street's forecast of 0.5%. The core inflation measure excludes volatile food and energy prices.</p><p>See: Cheaper gas holds down inflation, PCE shows, but the cost of everything else is still going up fast</p><p>The reading appeared to confirm similar data from the consumer-price index, another closely watched inflation barometer, which sent stocks reeling lower earlier this month when it showed that inflation in August was hotter than expected.</p><p>Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.Reily Wealth, said \"all eyes were on the PCE number\" Friday morning.</p><p>\"Clearly, the market needs to see inflation inputs improve, but that wasn't the case in August,\" he said.</p><p>However, lower Treasury yields were helping to offset the weak inflation data during what's expected to be a volatile session as market participants scramble to close positions, or open new ones, ahead of the end of the month, and the third quarter.</p><p>\"If you look at the yield curve, we're finally seeing some pullback both in the 2s and the 10s,\" Hogan added.</p><p>The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Ywas was down 1.3 points, or 4.176%, while the 10-year yieldBX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 4.6 basis points to 3.701%.</p><p>Investors also digested another troubling inflation report out of Europe, as consumer prices in the eurozone climbed by their fastest rate since the end of World War II last month.</p><p>This week has been a busy one for senior Fed officials, who have been bombarding investors with commentary about the Fed's plans for raising interest rates and combating inflation. On Friday, Vice Chair Lael Brainard reiterated that the Fed would keep interest rates elevated to combat inflation, even if it harms the economy.</p><p>See: Fed won't pull back from rate hikes prematurely, Brainard says</p><p>Since it will take time for high interest rates to bring inflation down, Brainard said the Fed is \"committed to avoiding pulling back prematurely.\"</p><p>Outside the U.S., the beleaguered British pound GBPUSD rose above pre mini-budget crisis levelsearlier in the day, helped by Wednesday's decision to buy long-dated gilts, as well as a decision by the U.K. government to meet with the country's independent budget forecasters. However, the pound was once again on the backfoot, down 0.8% to $1.1035.</p><p>Investors were also keeping an eye on megacap tech stocks. Apple Inc. AAPL was trading down 0.6% on Friday after leading markets lower a day earlier following a downgrade by Bank of America. Meta Platforms META was up 1.6% after announcing a hiring freeze.</p><p>Need to know: Here's why investors should start betting on Apple and the stock market now</p><p>Stocks in focus</p><p>* Shares of Nike Inc. NKE tumbled 11% after executives at the sportswear maker said price cuts to clear stockpiles from warehouses in North America would dent gross margins for the rest of the fiscal year. Analysts were raising red flags and cutting prices targets on the stock.</p><p>* Micron Technology MU stock rose after a report that Japan will grant it a $320 million subsidy to make advanced memory chips at its Hiroshima plant. That came a day after Micron posted quarterly earnings that included a forecast for a loss in the coming quarter and plans to scale back a build out of capacity.</p><p>â€” Barbara Kollmeyer contributed to this report</p><p>U.S. stocks waver after hot inflation report as bond yields pull back</p>",
