  "text": "<p>Many employers still have questions about the timeline for implementing the new rules and are waiting for details about how employers could access Covid tests for employees and how they should monitor results.</p><p>The Business Roundtable, which counts the chief executive officers of dozens of the biggest U.S. companies as members, said it \"welcomes the Biden Administration's continued vigilance in the fight against Covid,\" in a statement from Joshua Bolten, the group's president. \"Over the past several weeks many companies have decided to implement a vaccine mandate for some or all of their employees, a decision we applaud.\"</p><p>A trade group representing leaders of retailers such as Target Corp. and Nike Inc. cautioned that testing capacity in the country is already strained and would need to be significantly increased to meet the demand that will result from the new requirements.</p><p>\"It is essential that the administration understand that requiring large employers to mandate vaccination of all employees or produce a negative test is a colossal undertaking,\" said Brian Dodge, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. \"Testing capacity is already stressed and must be scaled immensely to meet the enormous demand that will result from these new requirements.\"</p><p>While a few large employers, including United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc., have begun mandating that all their workers get vaccinated, many companies have stopped short of such requirements. Delta Air Lines Inc. has imposed healthcare surcharges for unvaccinated employees, and others, such as Walmart Inc., have limited vaccine mandates to certain roles or employees returning to offices.</p><p>The Consumer Brands Association, whose members include General Mills Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., said President Biden's announcement raises questions that will require clarification. \"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, government has often failed to implement well-intentioned policy,\" the group's president, Geoff Freeman, said in a statement. \"As with other mandates, the devil is in the details. Without additional clarification for the business community, employee anxieties and questions will multiply.\"</p><p>Biden's Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate Splits Business Community</p>",
