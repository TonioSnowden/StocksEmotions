  "text": "<p><em>In this edition of Scoreboard, we explain why the Wimbledon tennis tournament limits deals with corporate sponsors, cover every angle of the Euro 2020 knockout stages, discuss why US Olympic track and field athletes depend on the fortune of Blackstone co-founder Steve Schwarzman, and more.</em></p> <h1>Wimbledon calls the shots with corporate sponsors</h1> <p><strong>Wimbledon, </strong>the annual tennis grand slam which began this week, wants to retain the feel of “an English garden”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Spectators eat strawberries and cream. Competitors adhere to an all-white dress code. And unlike other major sporting contests, corporate sponsors are barely visible around its verdant London grounds.</p> <p>“Walking on to the centre court at Wimbledon, no advertisement, no banners, everything is about tennis, all focus is on players and on the court,” said defending men's singles champion <strong>Novak Djokovic</strong>, a man with an array of personal endorsement deals.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I just find that very fascinating considering we're living in [a] very commercial, very material world today, that Wimbledon managed to preserve its culture, its tradition, which is phenomenal.”</p> <p>The <strong>All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club</strong>, the 153-year-old body that runs the Wimbledon championships, believes it's that culture and tradition that explains the tournament's enduring popularity.</p> <p>The vast majority of income is derived from broadcasting contracts and ticketing sales.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unlike other sports, it declines to hold regular auctions to pump up the value of media rights contracts. Instead, Wimbledon cultivates long-term broadcast partnerships seeking the widest possible audience. It has multiyear TV deals with the <strong>BBC</strong> in the UK, <strong>ESPN</strong> in the US and <strong>NHK</strong> in Japan.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wimbledon also sells 5-year debenture tickets for the best seats on Centre Court and Number One Court where the biggest matches are played. These have been snapped up for as much as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c6e2164-4fde-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49\">£80,000 each</a>.</p> <p>The AELTC's revenue totalled £295.7m in 2019 but plummeted to £4.9m last year after the Championships were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50fddb77-b963-424b-aaed-2d5fed4192a6\">cancelled</a> due to coronavirus. However, a pandemic insurance policy will cover most of those losses. Profits are used to support grassroots tennis and improve the grounds.</p> <p>These financial imperatives means Wimbledon calls the shots with sponsors. Indeed, they are called “official suppliers” and serve a clear purpose. Last year, it renewed deals with <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong>, which makes umpire uniforms, <strong>Jaguar</strong>, which provides cars to zip officials around the grounds, and <strong>Lavazza</strong>, which supplies coffee.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wimbledon is feeling some financial strain this year. Centre court is operating at 50 per cent capacity due to coronavirus restriction until the finals. Players are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eb09e13-94be-424f-96ba-f0095ac3fea3\">cut off from fans in a tight “bubble”</a> to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>Yet the tournament declined to boost its coffers by loosening policies on corporate endorsements. That would have harmed its traditionalist appeal. It shares this instinct with another elitist sporting contest: the <strong>Masters</strong>, the annual golf tournament held at Georgia's <strong>Augusta National Golf Club</strong>, which also eschews overt branding.</p> <p>“It almost makes you want to associate with them even more,” said <strong>Steve Martin</strong>, global chief executive of the <strong>M&amp;C Saatchi Sport &amp; Entertainment</strong> agency. “You're borrowing the values of those events — not slapping a logo everywhere and cheapening it.”</p> <h1>Squeaky bum time: the best of Euro 2020</h1> <p><em>A round-up of the FT's coverage of Europe's national football team tournament as it reaches the quarter finals</em></p> <ul>  <li><p>Germany's interior minister <strong>Horst Seehofer</strong> called Uefa's decision to keep the final matches of the <strong>Euro</strong> <strong>2020</strong> tournament in the UK “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0caa3cf3-eb5e-472f-801b-3ee25eda4248\">absolutely irresponsible</a>” blaming “commercial interests” for continuing to play the matches at London's Wembley Stadium as planned. He and other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdeab404-162c-41b5-9544-0886c8f977bf\">European politicians</a> are concerned about the rise of the delta coronavirus variant in the country.</p></li>  <li><p>On the pitch, <strong>England</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb9d2550-74fa-48f2-afcc-b9661d652bc6\">knocked out</a> <strong>Germany</strong> in a victory that was wildly celebrated. Ahead of the game, FT columnist Simon Kuper described it as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/495dc000-cc14-4475-85e4-7c5cd2dd3425\">one-sided rivalry that had lost its bite</a>. Still, the English switch from underdog to favourite in its quarter-final against <strong>Ukraine</strong> in Rome on Saturday.</p></li>  <li><p>England has progressed thanks in large part to goals from <strong>Raheem Sterling</strong>. As the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78f8c748-9e31-442f-b955-31d316a718a3\">FT reports</a>, the <strong>Manchester City</strong> forward has become symbolic of a culture war that is raging across the English game. His vocal views on race and the media portrayal of black sporting success has been divisive among some fans.</p></li>  <li><p>A series of tournament heavyweights fell in the first knockout round. Reigning champions <strong>Portugal</strong> lost to <strong>Belgium</strong>, while <strong>The Netherlands</strong> were beaten by <strong>Czech Republic</strong>. The biggest shock was tournament favourites <strong>France </strong>losing a thrilling tie against <strong>Switzerland</strong> on penalties. The fallout has been just as epic. French media <a href=\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Pogba-deschamps-rabiot-ca-a-chauffe-chez-les-bleus-sur-le-terrain-et-en-tribune/1266875\">reported</a> that the players' family members argued with one another in the stands.</p></li>  <li><p>By contrast, there has been joy in <strong>Denmark. </strong>As the FT's Richard Milne and Emma Agyemang <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cd17ed3-ed5a-4051-b251-d65744776cab\">report</a>, the Scandinavians have overcome the trauma of witnessing their talismanic midfielder <strong>Christian Eriksen</strong> suffer a near-fatal cardiac arrest in their opening match. The team have since riden a wave of national euphoria to leave the Danish public to dream of repeating its unlikely 1992 Euros success. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Italy</strong>&#xa0;beat Belgium in the quarter-finals on Friday. Simon Kuper wrote the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4320d1e-3292-443e-88d4-b99d9fdeec86\">secret to their success</a>&#xa0;is the midfield duo of&#xa0;<strong>Jorginho</strong>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<strong>Marco Veratti.&#xa0;</strong>The former is “director” of the team's success, the latter its “flamboyant star”. The&#xa0;Italians line up as favourites in their semi-final against&#xa0;<strong>Spain</strong>&#xa0;on Tuesday.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h1>Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman: funding track and field shortfalls</h1> <p>When long jumper <strong>Brittney Reese</strong> won the US Olympic track and field trials last week, she didn't just secure a berth to compete at the <strong>Tokyo Olympics</strong> this summer, she also met one of the conditions to receive pay from her outfitter, <strong>Nike</strong>.</p> <p>“If you make the team, you get money, if you place at the Olympics, you get money, if you hit a certain mark, you get money”, Reese told Scoreboard, explaining the circumstances in which she would receive cash from the US sportswear company.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reese, like other decorated but less visible Olympic hopefuls, relies instead on donations to get her to the competition starting line. The bulk of her guaranteed income this year came from an unusual source: <strong>Blackstone</strong> co-founder <strong>Steve Schwarzman</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since 2013, the private equity titan has committed a total of $12m in donations to the <strong>USA Track &amp; Field Foundation</strong>, making him the largest individual donor to the sport. His largesse has translated into dozens of grants to individual athletes like Reese, worth up to $25,000 annually.&#xa0;</p> <p>The funding model is one of the more jarring examples of inequality within the larger business of Olympic sports. The <strong>International Olympic Committee</strong> and media companies like <strong>NBC</strong> and <strong>Discovery</strong> earn billions from staging and broadcasting the games. Athletes rarely share in the spoils.</p> <p>It was a fact that Schwarzman was surprised to discover while watching the 2012 Olympics, when runner <strong>Morgan Uceny</strong> suffered a fall during the London 1500m final, inspiring Schwarzman's first phone call to the foundation.&#xa0;</p> <p>“A lot of these athletes really live hand to mouth,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91e17994-9095-4949-baf6-f70c3b4782b0\">Schwarzman told the FT,</a> who explained his rationale for personal track and field philanthropy, rather than the wider private equity trend of investing in sports.</p> <p>There are some indications that support is expanding. Just two years ago, Nike began offering benefits <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/sports/nike-pregnant-athletes.html\">for the first time</a> to sponsored athletes who became pregnant. And this week, former high school phenom <strong>Mary Cain</strong> <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a36856632/mary-cain-forms-womens-pro-running-team/\">launched</a> a professional running club which will pay salary and benefits, beginning at $60,000 a year.</p> <p>As this month's Tokyo Olympics comes into view, the question remains: should many of the world's best athletes be dependent on philanthropy for basic needs?</p> <p><em>Read the FT interview with Schwarzman on the state of US track and field </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91e17994-9095-4949-baf6-f70c3b4782b0\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The decision to pull a marquee golf tournament from <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s New Jersey course in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot in January has emerged as a central issue in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f81fb39c-3ce9-480b-aadc-46db8142cc35?shareType=nongift\">intensifying legal dispute</a> between the former US president's business empire and <strong>New York City</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Cash-strapped <strong>South African Rugby </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f72a8abf-e7e2-41ed-a7c1-bd62610fc526\">pushing ahead</a> with hosting a lucrative tour of the <strong>British and Irish Lions</strong>, despite an escalating coronavirus outbreak that has forced the entire Springboks squad to self-isolate. The series will, however, be played without spectators.</p></li>  <li><p>Italy's <strong>Juventus</strong> football club announced it was raising up to €400m in equity to cover huge Covid-related revenue shortfalls. The FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfc340eb-7ce1-4cd4-8e4d-2b55ae0ec2f6\">concluded</a>: “The pandemic has given lossmaking clubs useful cover for financings. The black-and-white message is pressure to shine on the pitch will depress profits long after everyone has been vaccinated.”</p></li>  <li><p>US investment group <strong>Ares </strong>revealed more than $1bn of debt and equity investments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a949bcbf-0081-405d-ad8e-4d438f2f9e88\">across global sport</a> in the last six months, including minority shareholdings in Spanish football champions <strong>Atlético Madrid </strong>and <strong>Formula One </strong>racing team <strong>McLaren Racing</strong>. It is the latest American fund to step into sports finance.</p></li>  <li><p>Shares in <strong>DraftKings </strong>and<strong> FanDuel</strong>-owner <strong>Flutter Entertainment</strong>, the two leading sports gambling groups operating in the US, have fallen by 25 per cent since March. Lex reckons <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/f09addcb-931e-4dc4-bace-c9c7a57e648c\">the declines were overdue</a> given there is no obvious path to profitability amid rapid expansion.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Giro d'Italia Donne</strong>, the elite women's road cycling race, <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/giro-ditalia-donne-unveil-route-with-an-aim-to-return-to-womens-worldtour/\">starts today</a>. The competition was demoted from <strong>Women's WorldTour </strong>status last season because it was unable to obtain live television coverage in another signal of how elite female riders struggle to secure commercial backing.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>The success of the <strong>Indian Premier League</strong>, the world's most lucrative cricket tournament, showed that Twenty20, a shorter format of the sport, could prosper alongside the traditional five-day Test matches. Data collectors and analysts have applied <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/cricviz-twenty20-cricket-data\">new statistical rigour to the sport</a>, Wired reports.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Transfer Market</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Being exceptional at sport used to be the route into sport. <strong>Josh Richards</strong>, a content creator with tens of millions of social media followers, is proving that a heavy presence on livestreaming service <strong>TikTok </strong>is another option. The <strong>National Hockey League</strong>, the North American competition, named him its “voice of the fans” and tasked him with attracting young supporters. He roots for the<strong> Toronto</strong> <strong>Maple Leafs</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Scott O'Neil </strong>resigned as the chief executive of <strong>Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment</strong>, which owns the <strong>Philadelphia 76ers</strong> basketball team and the <strong>New Jersey Devils</strong> ice hockey side. After eight years in charge, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottONeil/status/1410302690555535364\">he took to Twitter</a> to ask if he left the 76ers in a better state than when he arrived.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Last wicket stand</h1> <p>Spare a thought for <strong>Asif Ali</strong>, an amateur cricketer batting for <strong>Illingworth St Mary's Cricket Club</strong> in West Yorkshire, England. Clearing the boundary to score six runs is normally a moment to savour. But he then realised with horror that the ball was travelling towards his own car. Ali ended the day with 43 runs and without a back window.
