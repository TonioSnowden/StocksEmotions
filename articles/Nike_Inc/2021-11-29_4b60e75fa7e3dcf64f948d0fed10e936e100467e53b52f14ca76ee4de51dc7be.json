  "text": "<p>In an extensive interview with Golf Digest published Monday, Woods said he hopes to eventually play a handful of PGA tournaments a year. “I think something that is realistic is playing the tour one day — never full time, ever again — but pick and choose, just like Mr. [Ben] Hogan did. Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that,”&#xa0;he said in a Zoom video interview.</p><p>“It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it,” Woods said, adding “I don't have to compete and play against the best players in the world to have a great life.”</p><p>Woods was seriously injured in a rollover crash in Los Angeles in February, and has undergone a lengthy rehabilitation. “I have so far to go … I'm not even at the halfway point,” he told Golf Digest.</p><p>Last week, Woods posted a video of himself on social media taking practice swings, with the comment “Making progress.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/1462448711682957322Woods has won a record-tying 82 tournaments on the PGA Tour, and 15 major championships. His career was sidelined by scandal and injuries, but he mounted a years-long comeback and won The Masters in 2019 — his first victory at a major in 11 years.
