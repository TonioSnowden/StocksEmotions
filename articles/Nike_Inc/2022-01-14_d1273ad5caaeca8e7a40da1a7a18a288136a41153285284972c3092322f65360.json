  "title": "The Climate Challenge After Glasgow Summit: Making Good on Promises; Countries and companies are on the line for bold action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, but political and economic hurdles are making that harder",
  "text": "<p>The challenge was already formidable. By the end of the United Nations climate summit, known as COP26, more than 150 countries had announced new or updated steps to combat global warming by 2030, according to a U.N. report titled \"The Heat is On: A world of climate promises not yet delivered.\" Some 74 countries had made promises to eliminate or offset emissions—known as \"net zero\"—by dates ranging from 2030 to 2070.</p><p>The promises aim to limit global warming this century to the \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius goal agreed to at the Paris summit in 2015. If all are met, the temperature rise could be curbed at around 1.8 degrees, analysts estimate.</p><p>'Massive' challenges</p><p>Yet collectively, the major economies—known as the Group of 20—aren't even on track to hit previous weaker targets, the report noted. And climate-policy watchers say current trends, from political standoffs in the U.S. to soaring global prices for energy and goods, are creating added barriers.</p><p>\"The challenges here are really massive\" in the U.S., says Robert Stavins, professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University's Kennedy School. That is because they \"aren't simply economic, nor are they even technological, but are really political,\" he says.</p><p>Other aspirations announced at Glasgow include curbing methane emissions, developing global carbon-trading markets and halting deforestation by 2030.</p><p>Companies and other organizations are similarly under pressure to deliver on climate promises. There are \"net zero\" groups for universities, banks and even whiskey distilleries, which list thousands of companies and institutions pledging to neutralize greenhouse gases. Many activists say these are behind on implementation, too.</p><p>\"We had hoped that our campaigning would lead to bigger steps forward from banks,\" says Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, a Dutch group that monitors lenders and has been pushing them to stop financing investments in new fossil-fuel ventures. Some energy analysts are saying that to reach net zero, support for such projects should end now, but banks haven't yet said they'll stop financing, Mr. Frijns says.</p><p>Unless governments and companies lay the groundwork for climate actions in the next few years, they'll be hard-pressed to meet deadlines they announced at Glasgow, analysts say.</p><p>Take the U.S., the world's No. 2 greenhouse-gas emitter, after China. The U.S. last year promised to halve emissions by 2030 versus 2005, even though it wasn't on track for its previous, significantly weaker emissions-cutting pledge, the U.N. report says.</p><p>The U.S. could narrowly hit its latest 2030 target if legislators, regulators and big companies all \"work in earnest to address climate change,\" according to an October study by New York-based Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. That involves curbing carbon-heavy activities and providing economic incentives to channel investment and consumer spending toward things like renewable energy and cleaner-running cars.</p><p>Concrete steps</p><p>Some steps have been taken. Congress passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill last year that contained measures to attract investment and reduce red tape for projects like pipelines to transport carbon dioxide or underground wells to store it in, both deemed necessary to reduce the amount of gas vented into the air. In December, the Environmental Protection Agency increased fuel-efficiency standards for cars. Companies like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which each last year announced billions of dollars in investment in electric cars, have been bolstering their climate initiatives too.</p><p>But the biggest emissions-reduction impact—accounting for up to half of what Rhodium calculated necessary—comes from incentives for a host of activities, including capturing carbon emissions, installing methane-control equipment, and buying electric vehicles and heat pumps, says John Larsen, a lead author of the study. Those are in the $2 trillion bill stalled in the Senate.</p><p>Energy analysts also say that if Democrats lose their slim majorities in Congress in the November elections, it likely would upend President Biden's climate agenda, undercutting government support for emissions-curbing measures. Many analysts add that the Supreme Court could limit the authority of federal agencies like the EPA when it rules on some key cases this year. If that happens, it could lessen regulatory pressure on companies to take aggressive climate action, blunting one important tool for achieving the U.S.'s Glasgow goals.</p><p>\"It's going to be hard, in large part because we need sustained action,\" says Mr. Larsen.</p><p>China, the world's biggest emitter, is facing its own carbon-cutting hurdles. The country made relatively small adjustments to its 2030 climate goals before the Glasgow summit, and expects its emissions to stay roughly flat or even increase slightly during the next several years. That has prompted criticism from some world leaders that it needs to act faster. But China depends heavily on coal for its power, and officials there argue it will take years to shift away from that energy source, particularly since its economy is still growing quickly.</p><p>Electricity demand from China, along with fast-growing India, likely pushed global coal-power generation to a record high in 2021, the International Energy Agency said in December.</p><p>COP26 was also expected to usher in an international carbon market, following a long-awaited agreement on rules for cross-border trades. But it will take years to work out the details on global trading, or harmonize standards for the hodgepodge of carbon markets operating now, experts say.</p><p>Carbon-credit confusion</p><p>Some issues have become even muddier post-COP, as companies try to figure out how rules established to keep countries from counting emissions-reduction credits twice might apply to their own projects.</p><p>\"It's completely confusing\" for companies, says Kelley Kizzier, a vice president at New York-based nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. Ms. Kizzier is working with two groups that are creating guidelines for investors and suppliers in private carbon markets, and says she hopes by the end of the year to help companies \"understand what good looks like.\"</p><p>Carbon markets let participants trade credits or allowances linked to tons of carbon emissions, financing efforts to curb greenhouse gases and setting a price on pollution.</p><p>The biggest are regulated by governments, like the European Union, China or California. They typically require companies in heavy-emitting industries such as utilities to participate, and set limits for how much carbon can be emitted. Companies that produce less can sell their extra allowances to those that emit more.</p><p>Privately run markets let companies voluntarily buy credits by financing emissions-reduction or emissions-avoidance projects, such as protecting forests or building wind farms. Companies including Microsoft Corp. and Nike Inc. use such credits to lower their carbon footprints.</p><p>A few countries, including Japan and Switzerland, have deals with other nations that let them finance carbon-cutting projects in exchange for credits, so they can offset emissions at home.</p><p>Each market has different rules on what projects qualify for credits and how they should be audited. Watchdogs complain some allow credits for emissions reductions that aren't real—like forests in no danger of logging.</p><p>\"There are lots of systems emerging,\" says Mark Kenber, co-executive director of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, one of the groups assembling guidance on the markets. People are asking, \"'Are these things coherent? Do they work with each other?'\"</p><p>Ms. Dvorak is a Wall Street Journal reporter based in Houston.
