  "text": "<p>\n  First released in 1992, the down \"Nuptse\" jacket from the North Face -- an ample puffer offered in punchy colors -- quickly became a pre-Y2K fashion must-have, particularly among style-savvy teens. But the accessibly priced Nuptse is not a mere memory. Reissued in 2018, the nostalgia-packed style has proven so popular in the era of enforced outdoor socializing that certain sizes and colors are perpetually sold out on the North Face website. Even so, not everyone is ready (or willing) to so directly revisit '90s high-school style, so we've rounded up three other puffers that are sufficiently toasty and puffy, without the teenage connotations. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  High-End Heir: Nike x Sacai Jacket, $600, mrporter.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Dapper Descendant: Guides Down Hoody Jacket, $250, marmot.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Solid Contender: Alpine Light Down Jacket, $219, montbell.us </p><p></p>",
