  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Expressing  Gratitude  Has Broad  Benefits  ----  By Lane Florsheim",
  "text": "<p>   Before author Stephen King gets out of bed in the morning, he runs through a mental inventory of the things he's grateful for. So does actor Tracee Ellis Ross. Musician and director Questlove writes a 15-item gratitude list every Sunday. Nike CEO John Donahoe spends time meditating on questions like, \"What am I grateful for in the broad sense of my life? What am I grateful for in the previous day?\" Actor Kate Hudson restarted her gratitude journaling after a reflective Thanksgiving car ride. Model Bella Hadid likes listening to a daily gratitude meditation every morning. </p><p>   Gratitude isn't a new concept or a practice that's exclusive to celebrities. For one, it's a tenet of most major religions. In modern times, it was popularized in 1990s self-help books like \"Simple Abundance: 365 Days to a Balanced and Joyful Life,\" a bestseller for which its author Sarah Ban Breathnach also created an accompanying The Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude. Oprah Winfrey has extolled the virtues of gratitude journaling -- writing down things she's grateful for -- numerous times over the years. </p><p>   Robert A. Emmons, a psychologist and professor at University of California, Davis who's written several books on gratitude, says the pandemic is likely one of the reasons for the practice's increased popularity right now. \"In the face of crises and during troubling times, people rely on positive feelings to cope, and they seem to turn to gratitude more than any other positive emotion,\" he says. </p><p>   Alyssa Bonanno, 28, started her gratitude practice during a point in the pandemic when days started to feel as though they were blurring together. Ms. Bonanno, the co-owner of a creative agency in New York City, found that gratitude journaling in the evening was a nice signifier that work was done for the day. She uses a notebook in order to stay away from emails and says the exercise keeps her even-keeled the same way meditation or a workout does. \"I also think it's made me more gracious to the people who we work with,\" she says. </p><p>   \"Don't you feel like we're all struggling a little mentally right now because of the surge?\" says Amy Denet Deal, 57, the founder of Dine (Navajo) fashion and home brand 4Kinship. Every day, she wakes up at dawn, greets the sun and sets intentions for the day. \"Giving back is so helpful on all of these other emotions of fear, of depression, of all the things that have happened during Covid-19. It's taking ownership of, How can I be grateful? How can I give back?\" </p><p>   Martin E.P. Seligman, the director of the University of Pennsylvania's Positive Psychology Center, says, \"Humans are built to attend to the things that go badly in our lives. A lot of the exercises in positive psychology are ways of teaching people to savor and pay attention to what goes well.\" </p><p>   Dr. Emmons, the psychologist, says clinical trials indicate that gratitude practices can facilitate better sleep and lower blood pressure -- and that people who keep gratitude journals are on average happier than those who don't. </p><p>   Some CEOs, founders and executives say their practices have strengthened their leadership at work. Stacey Boyd, 52, founder and CEO of philanthropic shopping site Olivela, says she's been practicing gratitude for 16 years and that it's probably the most important thing she does every day. \"It always forces me to reflect not only on how I'm powering through my day but as importantly, how I'm interacting with others, and as a manager and leader, how I can do better at inspiring more and better from them.\" Others, like Susan Korn, 35, the founder of accessories brand Susan Alexandra, use gratitude as a team-building exercise. \"I think it makes people feel like they're doing something special,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
