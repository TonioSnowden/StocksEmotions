  "text": "<p>Nike was once the most popular and most counterfeited sportswear brand in China. Not any more. Chinese shoppers are now choosing local designers and homemade brands over imports.</p> <p>Known collectively as the “Fujian Tigers”, Chinese sportswear companies such as Anta Sports and Li-Ning started out making products for the likes of Nike and Adidas in the 1980s before making original products. </p> <p>Fat margins and soaring share prices have attracted the attention of several foreign short-sellers, including Carson Block's Muddy Waters. But the opposition has done little to damage share prices. Both companies are up more than fivefold in the past five years. Anta has also acquired the Chinese rights for Italian brand Fila.</p> <p>Nike's sales in China, still its fastest-growing market, missed expectations in the quarter to May. Consumers boycotted the US sportswear company for refusing to use cotton made in Xinjiang, where forced labour of Uyghur Muslims has reportedly been widespread.</p> <p>Those sales have gone directly to Chinese competitors, mostly Anta and Li-Ning, which support Xinjiang-sourced cotton. Online sales of Li-Ning's premium line surged fivefold at the peak of the Nike boycotts in May. Operating margins have more than doubled over the past three years to 20 per cent in the year to June. Debt to equity has shrunk. </p> <p>The pandemic has also given the duo an edge. Nike battled weeks of lost production after Vietnamese and Indonesian factories closed down following coronavirus-related restrictions. It is also battling a global shortage of container ships and record shipping costs. Chinese companies have escaped supply chain disruptions and saved on logistics costs because production is local.</p> <p>Shares of Li-Ning trade at a forward earnings multiple in line with Nike, even after gaining 55 per cent this year. On the same metric, Anta trades at a discount of about a quarter. Retail sales growth is slowing — not only for foreign brands but those owned by Asian companies such as South Korea's Fila. But any slowdown in the economy puts greater focus on functionality and price. Sales and shares of China's homegrown brands have further left to run.</p><p>Source:  2021 'China sportswear: Fujian Tigers earn their stripes in Nike fight' FT.com 28 December.
