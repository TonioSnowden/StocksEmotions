  "title": "Will Anyone Watch a TV Show About Streetwear? Amazon's 'Fairfax' Is Betting Yes. Amazon Prime's new adult animated series takes aim at sneaker obsessing and hoodie hoarding. But the show may be too niche for its own good.",
  "text": "<p>The show is overstuffed with knowing references to hype-happy streetwear in the real world: The animated quartet name-drops Grailed, a resale site; the characters lust after decade-plus-old Nike Dunks; and the shirt they're after carries Dr. Phil's face, a nod to head-scratcher Supreme collaborations which featured images of Kermit the Frog or Shrek. In the mold of long-running cartoons like \"The Simpsons,\" \"South Park\" and Netflix's recently finished \"BoJack Horseman,\" \"Fairfax\" is an animated show for adults that lampoons American culture. (Peppered with f-bombs, this is not a show to watch with your tween.) Whereas \"BoJack Horseman\" sunk its teeth into Hollywood, \"Fairfax\" takes aim at social-media addiction and the rabid fashion consumerism. (One of the executive producers of \"Fairfax\" worked on \"BoJack.\")</p><p>A brief synopsis of \"Fairfax\": Dale, a rock climber from Oregon who favors fanny packs and Patagonia, moves to Los Angeles and meets a trio of friends—Derica, Benny and Truman—all Latrine superfans. They introduce Dale to the high arts of chasing social media followers and flipping precious clothes. The show's title is taken from the street in L.A., the fictional address of Latrine and the real-life location of stores housing brands such as Supreme, the Hundreds and Tyler, the Creator's Golf Wang label.</p><p>In an interview, the show's creators Matthew Hausfater, Teddy Riley and Aaron Buschbaum talked openly about their fashion fixation. Each confessed to owning Supreme items and texting frequently about clothes. \"There was a year-long period when I was working at Barneys New York with Gen-Z kids that were showing me what was actually cool,\" said Mr. Hausfater, the group's resident fashion encyclopedia, who cited everyone from Rick Owens to the late Azzedine Alaïa in the interview. (Alaïa is also namechecked in a first-season episode.)</p><p>To beef up the show's fashion expertise, the creators brought on Nicholas Santiago and Matthew Hwang, the founders of Pizzaslime, a madcap internet clothing label, as consulting producers. Amazon Prime also launched a real-world Latrine collection, promoting it with youth culture sites like Hypebeast and even hosting a Latrine pop-up shop on Fairfax Avenue. \"We thought [the collection] would be a really fun way to create conversation and give people a taste of what the show would be like,\" said Mr. Riley.</p><p>But streetwear is still significantly more niche than, say, Hollywood. At times \"Fairfax\" is so preposterously specific that I wondered if I was the only one in on the joke. The friends briskly prattle on about Jason Kidd signature basketball sneakers and the rarest of Yeezys. An episode-long plotline has one character attempting to pilfer an elderly man's 1886 Levi's Red Tab jeans so he can resell them for profit.</p><p>Further, our do-it-for-the-likes culture is so absurd that it's hard to top reality. A midseason episode in which the gang attends a dystopian concert dubbed \"Chernobylfest,\" felt only mildly more ludicrous than the infamous Fyre Festival debacle, which was breathlessly promoted by Instagram influencers like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. And the decision to have Latrine sell salad spinners and a Taser seems barely satirical given that rabid collectors snap up inane Supreme-branded doodads like bolt cutters, kayaks and calculators. Indeed, Mr. Hausfater noted that the creators worried about being able to out-Supreme Supreme. \"We would make up a fake funny Latrine item [and] were like, 'I hope Supreme doesn't do this.'\"</p><p>Amazon does not release viewership figures, but some early reviews of the show have been unsparing: The headline for Variety's critique dubbed it a \"Trend-Obsessed Comedy That's More Depressing Than Funny.\" Still despite the critics, \"Fairfax\" does seem to have found a fan base.</p><p>I spoke with several viewers who binged the first season in as little as a day and can't wait for season two (\"Fairfax\" has a two-season order.) \"I think [the show] did a really good job of poking fun at the culture but also kind of showing people that are very passionate about it,\" said Marsalis Simpson-Faxio, 30, a student adviser in Minneapolis. He collects Supreme T-shirts and has a prized stash of around 70 sneakers—placing him in the meaty center of the target \"Fairfax\" demographic.</p><p>The show might appeal most to those who've already lived through their hypebeast years. When you've aged out of waiting days in line for sneakers or feeling like an outcast for wearing the \"wrong\" T-shirt, it's easier to find humor in your youthful follies. The creators said their own childhood fashion misadventures informed the series: Mr. Riley chuckled about saving for a Bape hoodie that zipped all the way up, while Mr. Buschbaum talked about spending his bar mitzvah money on a regrettable velour Sean John tracksuit.</p><p>Watching \"Fairfax\" triggered a slew of memories for Jayden Fleming, 30, an event host in Wichita, Kan. Seeing the teenagers' quest for a T-shirt in the first episode reminded him of his exploits buying the first Yeezy sneaker in 2007. \"We called stores in New York, called stores anywhere…we'd go to somebody's house who might have some shoes, turned out it's bogus,\" he recalled. Sounds like a plotline for season two.</p><p>More in Style &amp; FASHION</p><p>* Is 'Made in the U.S.A.' Dead? Not For L.A. Brand Chrome Hearts November 1, 2021</p><p>* Larry David, Style Icon?
