The Los Angeles Lakers renamed their stadium the Crypto.com Arena as part of a 20-year, $700 million deal. That is the largest-ever sports naming rights deal in the world. And the NBA's Miami Heat renamed their stadium FTX Arena in a 19-year deal worth $135 million.</p><p>Representatives for the the Steelers, Kraft Heinz and Acrisure did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment on this story.</p><p>See also: Wimbledon 2022 prize money: How much will each winner make?</p><p>See also: When LeBron James chose Nike in 2003, he gave up $28 million â€” it could end up making him $1 billion</p><p>One of the most famous aspects of Heinz Field among fans was the giant ketchup bottles above the jumbotron. The two huge ketchup bottles measuring 35-feet long, 9-feet wide, and 6-feet deep and weighing several tons sit atop the scoreboard, and they pour out (digital) ketchup whenever the home team is in the red zone.</p><p>Heinz Field no more: Pittsburgh Steelers home turf being renamed Acrisure Stadium, report says</p>",
