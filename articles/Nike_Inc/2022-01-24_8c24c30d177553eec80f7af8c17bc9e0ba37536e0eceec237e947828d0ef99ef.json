  "title": "Celebrity Lawyer Michael Avenatti's Fraud Trial Kicks Off; Prosecutors allege he stole nearly $300,000 from former client Stormy Daniels",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Avenatti, 50 years old, is charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Opening statements on Monday focused in part on Ms. Daniels's character and work.</p><p>\"Adult-film actresses and paranormal investigators can be victims of fraud and identity theft too, just like anybody else,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Rohrbach told a federal jury in Manhattan, referring to Ms. Daniels's interest in hunting for ghosts. The case, he said, wasn't about what she does for money.</p><p>Andrew Dalack, a lawyer for Mr. Avenatti, said the trial hinged on the credibility of Ms. Daniels, whom he called unreliable and unpredictable. He said Ms. Daniels had claimed she could speak with dead people and interact with a haunted doll named Susan who walks and talks.</p><p>\"When Ms. Daniels doesn't get her way, when she gets upset about something, she turns on the people closest to her,\" he said.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Mr. Avenatti began defrauding Ms. Daniels in August 2018.</p><p>After helping Ms. Daniels secure a book contract for her memoir, \"Full Disclosure,\" Mr. Avenatti stole a significant portion of her advance, including by sending an unauthorized letter that had a fake signature, prosecutors said. He then asked her literary agent to send payments to his own bank account, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti repeatedly lied to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Rohrbach told the jury.</p><p>\"He told her that the publisher was being slow,\" he said. \"He told her the publisher was working on it. But the whole time he had the money and he was spending it.\"</p><p>Mr. Dalack, the public defender representing Mr. Avenatti, said the lawyer had a contract with Ms. Daniels that entitled him to compensation. Ms. Daniels, he said, at various points didn't uphold her end of the agreement.</p><p>Clark Brewster, a lawyer for Ms. Daniels, in an emailed statement called Mr. Avenatti a \"convicted master manipulator\" and said his client's credibility \"will be corroborated by irrefutable facts.\"</p><p>The trial is the latest legal trouble for Mr. Avenatti, whose rise to fame came to an abrupt end in 2019 after he was indicted on separate charges. Mr. Avenatti was convicted in 2020 on charges that he tried to extort more than $20 million from Nike Inc. by threatening to expose damaging information about the company. Last July, Mr. Avenatti was sentenced to 2 Â½ years in prison in that case.</p><p>Separately, a California federal judge last year declared a mistrial in a case in which prosecutors accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing millions of dollars in client funds. Mr. Avenatti is appealing the judge's decision not to dismiss the charges.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Celebrity Lawyer Michael Avenatti's Fraud Trial Kicks Off</p>",
