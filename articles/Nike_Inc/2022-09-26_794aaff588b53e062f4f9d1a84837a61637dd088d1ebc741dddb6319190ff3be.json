  "text": "<p>\"I am overjoyed to have broken the world record in Berlin,\" Kipchoge said, according to World Athletics. \"I wanted to run the first half so fast. No limitations.\"</p><p>\"After 38 kilometers [23.6 miles] I knew I would be capable of breaking the world record. The circumstances were great, and so was the organization of the event. I'm really happy with today and impressed by the fans and their support.\"</p><p>Both of Kipchoge's world-record times, including his earlier world record set in 2018, came while he wore a new wave of springy, thick-soled shoes made by Nike that triggered a wave of copycats by other brands.</p><p>World Athletics, the governing body of competitive running, grandfathered in most of the changes rather than banning the new designs.</p><p>Kipchoge ran the first half of Sunday's marathon in a blistering 59:50. His pace slowed slightly in the second half but, still on world-record pace, he pulled away from his competitors and ran the rest of the way alone.</p><p>In October 2019, Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon in under two hours, though it doesn't count as a world record. On a closed course in Vienna, and helped by pace-setting runners and wearing Nike Vaporfly shoes, Kipchoge finished in 1 hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds.</p><p>On Sunday, Kipchoge wore Nike's Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT% 2, a model that launched in June, according to the brand.</p>",
