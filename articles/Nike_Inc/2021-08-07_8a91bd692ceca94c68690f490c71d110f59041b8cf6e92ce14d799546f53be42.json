  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: The New Look of Love --- Men are finally leaving their living rooms and re-entering the dating market, but those spiffy outfits that served them so well pre-pandemic seem like overkill. Here, advice on dressing to connect in 2021.",
  "text": "<p>For starters, as men emerge from their quarantine caves into a wobbly world, splashy suit-and-tie formality no longer feels appropriate. \"Now may not be the time to show off your brightest custom blazer or loudest Robert Graham print,\" said Tammy Shaklee, a certified matchmaker and the founder of H4M Matchmaking. Ms. Shaklee finds casual dressing for dates refreshing and more \"comfortable for a more subdued, face-to-face, getting-to-know-you type introduction.\" In other words, after what we've been through, let's be gentle with each other and avoid the sartorial pomp so prevalent in pre-pandemic dating.</p><p>That said, more relaxed attire does not mean dating itself has become any easier. The stakes are higher than ever. \"I'm much more selective now,\" said Mr. Kehoe. \"I go on way fewer dates and they're more important. When you think the world might end . . . you don't want to go on a random date.\" Imminent apocalypse aside, whether you're a 20-something playing the field or a romance veteran getting back out there after a silver divorce, you're re-entering the dating market at the same time as a lot of competitive men. If you can't beat them in terms of net worth or looks, you'll have to beat them with charm -- and in the menswear arena. Here, five dating-style tips from experts and single guys. And before you ask: Yes, you do need to wear pants.</p><p>Be Yourself, Casually</p><p>These days, gratuitous formality feels stuffy, affected and out of touch. \"It's more about being comfortable,\" said Mr. Kehoe, referring to his post-lockdown dating attire. He believes that, when dressing for a date, you should put \"your best foot forward,\" but not project a disingenuous distortion of your real self. Before Covid, he would layer on a fashionable first-date veneer, wearing tucked-in button downs, Hermes belts and Gucci loafers. But that status-conscious strategy feels phony now that he spends most days in Converse sneakers, Levi's and Grateful Dead T-shirts. \"At the end of the day, they like you or they don't, so why wear something you don't [normally] wear?\" Lately, Mr. Kehoe has adopted a dating uniform of jeans and T-shirts. He contends the just-laid-back-enough look establishes an unpretentious tone that's \"appreciated on the other side.\"</p><p>Good Jeans Never Fail You</p><p>Wool trousers, stiff khakis and anything reminiscent of pre-pandemic office attire are solidly out. Jeans, however, have never been more apropos. A considered pair telegraphs that you thought about your first-date look -- but didn't overthink it. The wrong pair, however, could inspire your date to escape through a bathroom window at risk of shredding her own outfit. Though advising on a wash is tricky, avoid anything overwrought or Twisted Sister-ish. Really focus on fit, said Greta Tufvesson, co-founder of bespoke matchmaking service the Bevy, which serves clients in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. \"I don't think a man should wear a baggy, long jean. It should be fitted around his legs and tailored to his correct inseam.\" Ms. Tufvesson, who also approves of a rolled cuff, advises her clients to team their denim with a nice T-shirt (she champions navy Breton stripes this time of year) and toss a softly tailored jacket over the ensemble for a dressier look.</p><p>Get Your Sneak On</p><p>Leave the tasseled loafers at home, and unless you're dating someone uptight and titled, pass over those over-polished oxfords. The look of the moment is something approachable, low-profile, non-pinching. Self-proclaimed \"sneakerhead\" and Miami-based real-estate investor Alex Cohen, 37, often turns to minimalist white leather sneakers from Oliver Cabells. Even in a \"flashy\" place like Miami that \"demands a certain look when you're out,\" he said, a dress shoe feels too highbrow these days. When he wants to show off, he'll sport a pair of crisp Nike Jordan 1's. But Ms. Tufvesson warns that such splashy styles should be left to expert outfit coordinators who \"have a little bit more of an eye.\" For the rest of us, she recommends a clean, classic option -- like Common Projects or Vejas -- easy to dress up or down.</p><p>Embrace Your Quaran-do</p><p>Quarantined from our barbers and safely locked away from judgy friends and co-workers, many of us have experimented with new hair lengths, styles and even colors during the pandemic -- to varying degrees of success. While weathering a divorce over the past year, Brad Cormier, a cybersecurity sales professional in Boston, returned to the lengthier hair of his college days. \"I'm going for the Sean Hunter [of 'Boy Meets World'] look,\" said Mr. Cormier, 31. \"I had forgotten that I look pretty good with long hair.\" However, his collegiate \"styling\" approach -- throwing a baseball cap over shower-damp hair -- won't cut it as he re-enters the dating market. It's fine to keep your quaran-do; just make sure your grooming habits are up to snuff. Mr. Cormier uses Dove Men+Care Molding Paste to tame his wild mane for dates, parting it on the right slide and slicking it back like \"a less greasy Gordon Gekko.\" And he leaves the baseball cap at home.</p><p>Engage Their Olfactory Senses</p><p>In all those lonely months spent working from home, many of us paid little heed to how we smell. Fragrance is a divisive subject, but a conservatively applied, inoffensive dab can finesse your appeal. When attempting to be a stimulating companion, it doesn't hurt to \"stimulate as many senses as possible,\" said 36-year-old Kyle Biskit, who manages luxury rental properties in Los Angeles. \"Anyone can dress right, but finding the right fragrance adds to your mystique.\" If you're up for scent, wear just enough to engage your date's olfaction but not so much that you send your companion, the waiter and the adjacent table into sneezing fits. Mr. Biskit wears Creed's Millesime Imperial, a crowd-pleasing blend of \"sun-kissed citrus and rich musk.\" He had been \"wearing less and less fragrance during the pandemic,\" but now that his dating life is starting to heat up again, he swears that finishing any look with fragrance is \"extremely important.\"</p>",
