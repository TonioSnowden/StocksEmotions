  "title": "Birkenstock Wants to Keep Rival Sandals Off Shelves at Nordstrom, Zappos, Other Retailers; Footwear maker presses retailers to drop copycat styles; rival calls it 'competitive bullying'",
  "text": "<p>\"This is competitive bullying,\" said Rusty Hall, chief executive of Mephisto USA. \"We haven't infringed on any design patent.\" Mr. Hall said Nordstrom and Zappos recently canceled orders for Mephisto's Harmony and Hester sandals that his company has sold for more than two decades, because they look too similar to Birkenstock's Arizona style. Representatives for the other footwear brands didn't respond or had no comment.</p><p>A spokesman for Birkenstock Group B.V. &amp; Co. KG said retailers are making the decision about what to sell on their own. He added that Birkenstock has an obligation to protect its brand and will make it available only to retailers who maintain its integrity.</p><p>Tacey Powers, Nordstrom's general merchandise manager for shoes, said the department-store chain is eliminating duplication. \"We always try to be thoughtful about shoes that closely resemble an iconic style, especially when we know our customers love the original,\" she said. Zappos declined to comment.</p><p>Companies from Nike Inc. to Chanel SA go to great lengths to protect their brands from copycats. Nike stopped selling directly to Amazon.com Inc. in 2019, and Chanel has sued luxury consignment retailer The RealReal Inc. over alleged counterfeits.</p><p>In 2011, Christian Louboutin SA sued Yves Saint Laurent over a monochromatic red shoe that Louboutin said violated its trademarked red soles. A federal appeals court ruled that Louboutin's soles are protected—but only if the entire shoe isn't red.</p><p>Birkenstock's footbeds are trademarked, and it holds several design patents on newer styles, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p><p>Nevertheless, it might be difficult for it to police look-alikes, said Megan Bannigan, a partner at the law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, which defended YSL in the Louboutin case but isn't involved with Birkenstock's efforts. \"There have been so many copycats out there for years, it could be hard for Birkenstock to show that they have been using some of these designs exclusively,\" she said.</p><p>The Birkenstock spokesman said the company has been successful in defending its trademarks.</p><p>Founded in 1774 by German brothers Johannes Birkenstock and Johann Adam Birkenstock, the brand became known for its sandals with a cork-latex sole and an orthopedic footbed secured by leather straps. For many years the brand was more popular with nature watchers than runway watchers.</p><p>The shoes got a reboot in recent years, after fashion houses such as Celine and Givenchy put their twist on the comfy sandals. Celine's version was dubbed Furkenstocks for their fur-lining.</p><p>Birkenstock, based in Linz am Rhein, Germany, has churned out new versions, including blinged-out styles in collaborations with designers such as the shoemaker Manolo Blahnik.</p><p>Birkenstock makes a range of sandals from rubberlike beach shoes that sell for $50 to its core leather sandals, which average around $130. Its designer collaborations are pricier. A Manolo Blahnik velvet Birkenstock sandal with a crystal buckle is priced at $810. The look-alikes have a range of prices too, from around $40 to several hundred dollars. Some versions of Mephisto's Hester sandal sell for $169.</p><p>Descendants of the founders last year sold more than half the company to L Catterton, the private-equity firm co-owned by Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, and Financière Agache, the Arnault family holding company.</p><p>Birkenstock has also tried to police online sales. It stopped selling directly to Amazon in 2016. Beginning in August 2022, Birkenstock will no longer allow third parties to sell its products on Amazon's marketplace, according to an email sent by David Kahan, chief executive of Birkenstock Americas, to retailers and resellers that was viewed by the Journal.</p><p>The Birkenstock spokesman said the company prohibits the sale of its products by any authorized retailer on any third-party marketplace in the U.S., including Amazon. \"We found that Amazon was not taking decisive enough action against product counterfeiting and other trademark infringements,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment.</p><p>In September 2020, Birkenstock's New England sales representative sent an email to retailers warning about styles that \"piggyback\" or \"feed off\" Birkenstock's success such as Freedom Moses and Viking Sandals.</p><p>\"It is your choice and your choice alone whom you do business with,\" the representative wrote. \"It is my job to communicate to you that we will only move forward in 2021 with those retail partners who value our partnership.\"</p><p>Shortly after the missive, a small retailer sent an email to one of its suppliers, which makes a style that is similar to a Birkenstock sandal. The retailer wrote that it planned to drop the supplier's sandal because it wanted to \"avoid even the appearance of carrying a look alike.\"</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com</p><p>Birkenstock Wants to Keep Rival Sandals Off Shelves at Nordstrom, Zappos, Other Retailers</p>",
