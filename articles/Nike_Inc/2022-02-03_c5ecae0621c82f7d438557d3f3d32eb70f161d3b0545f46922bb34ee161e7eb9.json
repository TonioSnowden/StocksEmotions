  "title": "U.S. News: Michael Avenatti Case Goes to Jury After Closing Arguments",
  "text": "<p>As he had done earlier in the trial, Mr. Avenatti highlighted the paranormal beliefs of Ms. Daniels, an adult-film actress who is the government's lead witness. Ms. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, previously testified at the trial that she can talk to the dead and to a doll named Susan.</p><p>\"Does this sound like someone the government should be using as their star witness?\" he asked the jury.</p><p>Prosecutors say Mr. Avenatti stole nearly $300,000 from Ms. Daniels and for months lied to cover up his actions. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman said Wednesday that Mr. Avenatti attacked Ms. Daniels's credibility to distract from the \"mountain of evidence\" showing he committed a crime.</p><p>\"Does she have some unusual beliefs? Sure,\" Mr. Sobelman said of Ms. Daniels. \"But she's the victim in this case.\"</p><p>Mr. Avenatti, 50 years old, faces charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He has portrayed the case as a fee dispute. The jury deliberated for about two hours Wednesday. They are expected to resume deliberations Thursday morning.</p><p>In 2020 Mr. Avenatti was convicted of attempting to extort more than $20 million from Nike Inc. He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison and has appealed the conviction. He is expected to start his sentence later this month.</p><p>His latest trial, which began last week, has taken several unusual turns. A day into the trial, Mr. Avenatti chose to represent himself rather than have his public defenders do so. He didn't call any witnesses as part of his defense and decided not to testify after previously indicating that he likely would do so.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti on Wednesday said that when he agreed to represent Ms. Daniels in 2018, many lawyers wouldn't take her case or wanted to charge her large sums of money upfront. Ms. Daniels has alleged a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, which the former president has denied. Mr. Avenatti said he helped her in her legal work and in obtaining a book deal.</p><p>But Mr. Sobelman said Mr. Avenatti was desperate for money in 2018. Text messages and documents showed he lied to Ms. Daniels about her book publisher sending payments, Mr. Sobelman said. In reality, Mr. Avenatti had received some of the money from the publisher and spent it on his personal expenses, according to the prosecutor.</p>",
