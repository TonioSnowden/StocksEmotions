  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Under Armour is making an impressive comeback. Can that continue once it rejoins the varsity squad? </p><p>\n  Revenue in the athletic-wear maker's fourth quarter was down 3% from the same period a year earlier, better than the 12% drop analysts expected. Its best-performing category was accessories, which registered a 32% bump thanks to sales of face masks. Net income was $184 million; analysts expected a loss for the period. </p><p>\n  It helped that Under Armour set the bar low. Earlier in 2020, the company predicted a year-over-year revenue drop of 20% to 25% in the second half and then handily cleared the hurdle in the third quarter, when revenue came in flat. Subsequently, it raised the expectations only slightly, projecting a decline in the low teens for the fourth quarter. Compared with its competitors, though, Under Armour's numbers don't look so great: Nike and Lululemon logged sales growth of 9% and 22%, respectively, in their most recent quarters. </p><p>\n  Under Armour's downfall was offering its products at too many stores, including off-price sellers. While that approach helped power its top line for a couple of years, it also eroded the brand's cachet and pricing power as too many products ended up on clearance racks, according to Paul Lejuez, equity analyst at Citi. The company plans to pull out of up to 3,000 wholesale stores over time and is doubling down on selling directly to consumers. </p><p>\n  To show that its plan is succeeding, sales need to hold up as Under Armour narrows its distribution, which will begin in the second half of 2021. Margins also will have to improve substantially as a result. That could be tough given that expenses have remained stubbornly high even after sales retreated. Fourth-quarter operating margins were 4%, less than half of their 2016 level and a far cry from the company's double-digit target. Given the extra spending that goes into building direct-to-consumer relationships, expenses are likely to remain sticky. </p><p>\n  Under Armour's shares jumped more than 8% Wednesday following its earnings announcement and have now regained all of their losses suffered since the 2019 disclosure of an accounting probe. That puts its shares at 1.9 times 12-month forward sales, well above its five-year average despite the fact that the company has lost market share in North America, its largest market, every year since 2017. </p><p>\n  Under Armour is now past the stage in which everybody gets a trophy. </p><p></p>",
