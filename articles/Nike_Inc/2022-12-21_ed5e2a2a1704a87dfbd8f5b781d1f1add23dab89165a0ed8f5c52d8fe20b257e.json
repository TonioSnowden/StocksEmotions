  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose almost 33 points, or 0.8%, to around 3,882.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 jumped 352 points, or 1.1%, to 33,405.</p><p>* Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 rose almost 64 points, or 0.6%, to 11,239.</p><p>On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 SPX, Dow industrials DJIA and Nasdaq Composite COMP posted modest gains, snapping a four-day string of losses.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>Stocks futures rose after Wall Street broke its losing streak.</p><p>Markets brushed aside a surprise monetary shift by the Bank of Japan, where it raised the yield at which it allows bond to trade. The move has been viewed as a first step toward the bank ending its era of ultra easy monetary policy, though BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda described the measure as neither a tightening nor a move toward the exit.</p><p>Read: Why the Bank of Japan's surprise policy twist rattled global financial markets</p><p>\"The BOJ announcement was a late-year surprise, but while it echoed the hawkish ECB (and that's why stocks and bonds initially dropped) it isn't a materially hawkish addition to the macro outlook, and that's why stocks largely ignored it in the end,\" said Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research, in a note Wednesday.</p><p>\"More broadly, stocks are digesting the declines of the past two weeks,\" he said. \"While there are some notable employment and inflation numbers looming on Thursday and Friday, the bottom line is the calendar into year-end should be mostly quiet, again barring any material surprises.\"</p><p>Results from Nike Inc. NKE and FedEx Corp. FDX may be boosting sentiment on Wednesday. Shares of Nike jumped more than 11% in premarket trading after the sports retailer's earnings and sales blew out analysts expectations. And FedEx stock was up more than 5% after investors looked past softer-than-expected sales and focused on parcel-delivery service's profit forecast.</p><p>Investors are not ready to let go of the idea that the U.S. economy remains on firmer footing, despite recession worries, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.</p><p>\"Yes, the concerns are there that going in 2023, we are likely to see a recession taking place in the U.S., which the Fed denies for the time being. But given the robustness of the economy and the resilience in the economic numbers, it is unlikely to anticipate a scenario under which we will see a massive and prolonged period of crisis in the U.S.,\" he told clients in a note.</p><p>Crude oil prices CL.1 were up 2% at around $77.77 a barrel, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was down about five basis points at 3.64%, according to FactSet data, at last check.</p><p>Dow futures jump 350 points after Wall Street snaps a losing run</p>",
