  "text": "<p>Billionaire investor Ken Griffin has warned that there will be a recession in the US and said the Federal Reserve needed to do more to bring down inflation, days after the central bank increased its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row.</p> <p>“Everybody likes to forecast recessions and there will be one,” he said at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York yesterday. “It's just a question of when and, frankly, how hard.” A recession could happen as soon as next year, he added.</p> <p>The founder of hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities said increasing interest rates was an “awkward tool” to cool the economy but acknowledged the Fed was limited in what it could do to curb inflation.</p> <p>Griffin joins a growing chorus of voices predicting pain for the US economy, including Fed chair Jay Powell, who last week said there was not a “painless way” to bring inflation under control.</p> <p>The president of the Atlanta Fed, Raphael Bostic, yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276c1364-c312-4ad8-8b76-31f4d25dfa5f\">backed a fourth 0.75 percentage point rate rise</a> at the next policy meeting in November, followed by a half-point adjustment in December.</p> <p>That would bring the federal funds rate from its current level of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent to a new target range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p> <p>“The US economy still has a considerable amount of momentum,” Bostic told reporters. </p> <p>Despite the gloomy outlook, Griffin said the Fed needed to stick with its campaign to tighten monetary policy. “We should continue on the path that we're on to make sure that we re-anchor inflation expectations,” he said, so people do not start to treat inflation of 5 or 6 per cent as the norm.</p> <p>Stanley Druckenmiller, a veteran of the hedge fund industry, speaking at the same conference, adopted an even gloomier stance. “We are in deep trouble,” he said, adding that he would be “stunned” if the US did not tip into a recession next year.</p> <p><em>Do you think the Federal Reserve can engineer a “soft landing” for the US economy or do you think the country is heading into recession?

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is expected to report a loss in its second quarter, which ended in August in the first set of financial results since the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e38097a0-94e8-43f4-ae90-2b53cd22ca74\">death of its chief financial officer</a>.</p> <p><strong>US-Philippine talks </strong>US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Philippine counterpart Jose Faustino Jr will join <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b63e6e30-5dea-40a2-bcb8-9b9f1bea400e\">bilateral military co-ordination talks</a> in Hawaii, the first time such senior figures have participated in the annual discussions. The two militaries also plan to double the scale of joint exercises next year.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Xi Jinping's coronation looms</strong> China's government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b9d85e4-ef3a-4d3e-9555-3fd9ebccd27f\">is increasingly taking a back seat</a> to the man who has dominated it for the past decade: President Xi Jinping, who is set to secure a third term in power next month.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Plus:</strong> China's corruption probe <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8358e81b-f4e7-4bad-bc08-19a77035e1b4\">casts a shadow over the country's chip sector</a>, following allegations of graft and wasteful spending.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>The UK is unprepared for the heatwaves to come</strong> Heat — real heat, the type that forced you to cross the street for shade or keep your dog indoors — was once foreign in Britain. But this summer brought 40C temperatures, turning an occasional blessing into a curse. Henry Mance asks, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87b55406-4034-4c84-8451-0a258ac41161\">how will it change the country</a>?</p> <p><strong>Is Europe's energy plan enough to get through winter? </strong>With temperatures dropping and Russian gas imports at a fraction of former levels, energy ministers are discussing a package of windfall taxes aimed at curbing energy prices. But a growing number of member states <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d40c434a-01db-48a2-a535-3dd502354736\">warn that proposals do not go far enough</a> and risk sparking political unrest.</p> <p><strong>AI-driven justice may be better than none at all </strong>Countries are beginning to experiment with using artificial intelligence-driven algorithms to mete out court judgments, replacing humans with “robot judges” (although no robot is involved). While some fear automation could reinforce bias, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5709548-03bd-4f65-b9b5-7aa0325c0f6b\">it could tackle backlogs</a>, Jemima Kelly writes.</p> <p><strong>Why are musicians cancelling tours? </strong>This year was supposed to mark the triumphant return of concerts. But following the cancellation of live appearances by some of the world's biggest performers — including Shawn Mendes, Justin Bieber and Adele — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5ed6960-fc90-4830-861c-d57a4e090833\">the return to live shows is looking more precarious</a>, writes Anna Nicolaou.</p> <h1>Sport</h1> <p>Satisfy is a frontrunner in a group of independent labels offering a design-led take on distance-wear.
