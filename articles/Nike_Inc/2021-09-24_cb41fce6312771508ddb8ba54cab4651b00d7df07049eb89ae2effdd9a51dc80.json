  "text": "<p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 fell 159 points, or 0.5%, to 34,485</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 declined 24.75 points, or 0.5%, to 4,414.</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 dropped 113.50 points, or 0.7%, to 15,190.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 507 points, or 1.48%, to 34765, its biggest two-day point and percentage gain since Mar. 8, 2021, according to Dow Jones data. The S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 53 points, or 1.21%, to 4449, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 155 points, or 1.04%, to 15052.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Equity benchmarks have enjoyed two strong days of gains following the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday, as investors welcomed a delay to the start of the tapering of the central bank's bond purchases and ignored the projected rise in interest rates in 2022.</p><p>“Something has clearly changed and positioning on rates is shifting. U.S. 10yr yields jumped to 1.44%, posting their biggest one-day gain since March, whilst 30 year bond yields jumped the most in a single day since March 2020,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. Thursday also saw several global central banks meet, with interest rate hikes out of Norway and Turkey.</p><p>“Although the Fed and [Bank of England] remain&#xa0;fairly cautious&#xa0;and the dogma of transitory inflation persists, they're starting to move beyond pandemic-era emergency mode. Investors see this and are moving too — rates steepening again as they did earlier this year,” said Wilson.</p><p>Major US. stock indexes were holding on to slim weekly gains, in a week that began with sharp losses linked to fears over global contagion from troubles surrounding property group China Evergrande.</p><p>As of Thursday, bondholders still hadn't received any money from China Evergrande HK:3333, which was due to make a $83.5 million interest payment on dollar bonds, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.</p><p>The company has a 30-day grace period to make a payment, but barring that, Evergrande could trigger a default. Those shares fell 12% in Hong Kong on Friday. Elsewhere, media reports said Friday that the company's electric-vehicle unit hadn't paid suppliers in months, with employees also receiving no salary for September.</p><p>Elsewhere, Friday's U.S. data calendar is light with August new home sales due at 10 a.m. Eastern. At the same time, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to give opening remarks at a “Fed Listens” event.</p><p>Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will speak to the Ohio Bankers League conference at 8:45 a.m.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Nike Inc.NKE fell 4% in premarket trading after the sportswear maker reported quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street expectations, and said wages and overhead expenses weighed on revenue.</p><p>Costco Wholesale Corp. COST shares rose modestly as the retailer topped $60 billion in net sales in a single quarter for the first time, hit $5 billion in annual profit and grew at its fastest pace in more than 20 years.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 2 basis points to 1.428%.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of rivals, fell 0.3% to 93.15.</p><p>Oil futures were steady, with the U.S. benchmark CL00 barely higher at $73.34 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 rose 0.2% to $1,754 an ounce.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HK:HSI dropped 1.3%, while China's CSI 300 index XX:000300 finished unchanged. The Nikkei 225 index JP:NIK jumped 2%.</p><p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP was ready to break with three straight days of gains, down 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 index UK:UKX slipped 0.2%.</p>",
