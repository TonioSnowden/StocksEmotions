  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Friday's Markets:  Stocks Notch  Gains Despite  China Worries  ----  By Will Horner and Alexander Osipovich",
  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 ticked up on Friday, clinching weekly gains despite uncertainty over the fate of indebted property giant China Evergrande Group. </p><p>   The Dow added 33.18 points, or 0.1%, to close at 34798.00. The S&amp;P 500 rose 6.50, or 0.1%, to 4455.48. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.54, or less than 0.1%, to 15047.70. </p><p>   Friday's session was a quiet end to an eventful week. Markets had been whipsawed in recent days by fears that the possible collapse of Evergrande could spill over into global markets and worsen an already darkening outlook for global growth. </p><p>   Investors who own Evergrande's U.S. dollar bonds hadn't received an interest payment by a Thursday deadline, raising concerns about a potential default. Evergrande shares fell 11.6% Friday in Hong Kong, and are down more than 84% this year. </p><p>   \"It is one of the largest companies in the second-largest economy in the world and if something pulls down Chinese growth it is going to pull down global growth,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. </p><p>   Such fears sparked a wave of selling at the start of the week, but the market recovered its footing Wednesday as investors seized the opportunity to buy the dip. The Federal Reserve also helped boost confidence that day when it said the U.S. economy had made enough progress for the central bank to start dialing back its stimulus efforts as soon as November. The Dow rallied a combined 2.5% on Wednesday and Thursday, in its biggest two-day gain since March. </p><p>   The Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended Friday with weekly gains of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Nasdaq was little changed for the week. </p><p>   The week's rebound showed how many investors feel they have no alternative but to keep piling money into stocks, with bonds unattractive due to low interest rates, said Phillip Toews, chief executive of Toews Asset Management. \"If you want to have gains anywhere, the stock market is the place to be,\" he said. </p><p>   Cryptocurrencies were also in the spotlight this week as the tremors from China and mounting pressure from regulators around the world jolted digital-asset markets. On Friday, crypto prices fell after China's central bank declared all cryptocurrency-related transactions illegal. Bitcoin fell nearly 5% from its 5 p.m. ET level Thursday to about $42,486, according to CoinDesk. Ether slumped more than 7%. </p><p>   Meredith Corp. surged $11.41, or 25%, to $56.30 a share Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the People Magazine publisher was in talks to be acquired by Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. </p><p>   Shares of Nike tumbled $9.99, or 6.3%, to $149.59 after the sportswear giant lowered revenue guidance, citing supply-chain disruptions in Asia. </p><p>   In commodity markets, oil rose to a nearly three-year high amid continued supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and strong energy demand. Front-month futures on benchmark Brent crude oil rose 1.1% to $78.09 per barrel. </p><p>   Government bond yields have climbed this week after several central banks -- including the Fed -- signaled they were on the path toward removing pandemic-era stimulus measures. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.459% on Friday, its highest settle value since July, from 1.408% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. </p><p></p>",
