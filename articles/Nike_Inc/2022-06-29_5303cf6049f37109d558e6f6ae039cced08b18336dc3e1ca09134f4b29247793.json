  "text": "<p>H&amp;M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, reported better than expected quarterly profits as it raised prices and consumers returned to its stores following coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.</p> <p>The Swedish group on Wednesday said its second-quarter gross margin rose to 52.2 per cent in the three months to the end of May, up from 50.9 per cent in the same period a year ago. </p> <p>Net profit for the quarter was SKr3.68bn ($361mn), well ahead of analysts' forecasts of SKr3bn and up from SKr2.76bn in the same quarter a year ago.</p> <p>Sales in stores were especially strong, said chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/5915e3cd-1249-45d1-b8ba-e9eef2b7ec3c\">Helena Helmersson</a>. “In hindsight, nobody really thought people would go back to stores to the extent they have,” she told the Financial Times. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/db6792b2-8922-4a41-a4da-c06adf7617b7\">the company</a> will not be altering its investment plans or strategy in response, she added. “We see more and more people wanting to do both [online and stores].”</p> <p>Shares in the Stockholm-listed group were up 1.5 per cent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, though they have underperformed the market this year.</p> <p>Helmersson also said that while inflationary pressures remained substantial, the group had not yet seen a downturn in consumer spending.</p> <p>“We are doing everything we can to mitigate cost inflation,” she said, including raising prices as UK mid-market rivals such as Next have also indicated they will do.</p> <p>“Of course we are looking at inflation and pricing . . . we are looking at customer feedback and what our competitors are doing but we also have to make sure we are the place to go if you want value for money and sustainable fashion,” she added.</p> <p>Although trading in the second quarter was better than forecast, H&amp;M said sales in June would be around 6 per cent lower than a strong comparative period last year. </p> <p>Around five percentage points of that was a result of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf34f05f-0915-4f3b-b75b-20686b053364\">suspension of activity</a> in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, where the group has 181 stores and more than 7,000 employees.</p> <p>The three countries account for around 10 per cent of H&amp;M's operating profit, but Helmersson would not be drawn on the group's longer-term intentions.</p> <p>“We are of course very concerned about the situation . . . we are actively looking at options, there are so many factors to take into consideration,” she said. </p> <p>US sportswear giant Nike recently became the latest multinational to fully withdraw from Russia, three months after suspending its operations there.</p> <p>Russia was also a factor in higher stock levels at H&amp;M as inventory was transferred from there to other regions. Combined with higher-than-normal levels of advance orders to counter supply chain disruption, that pushed inventory up to 19.2 per cent of annual sales.</p> <p>Stock levels are keenly watched by analysts as they can be a precursor of future discounting, but Helmersson said she expected stock levels to normalise as supply chain disruption eased.</p> <p>Richard Chamberlain, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said trading in June was up against strong comparable figures but that these too would become easier as the year progressed. </p> <p>H&amp;M also said it would accelerate its expansion in South America and had signed “a large number of leases”. Most of the 94 stores it plans to open this year are in developing markets, but they will be more than offset by the expected closure of 272 stores, mostly in established markets.</p> <p>The group will also spend around SKr3bn on buying back its B shares this year.</p> <p><em>This article has been amended since publication to remove an incorrect reference to the impact of H&amp;M's buybacks on its earnings per share</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley in London 2022 'H&amp;M beats profit expectations after cutting back on discounts' FT.com 29 June.
