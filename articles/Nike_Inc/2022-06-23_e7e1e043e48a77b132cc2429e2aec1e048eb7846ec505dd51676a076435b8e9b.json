We cheered heartily for great play, including by those who choose to not play only on the PGA Tour.</p><p>Stephen Lake</p><p>Newton, Mass.</p><p>---</p><p>It is best if nobody gets too sanctimonious about the Saudis. Any of those PGA golfers ever heard of slave labor in China's Xinjiang province? It is worth noting that Nike joined other popular brands to oppose a bill before Congress cracking down on imports of goods made by forced laborers in Xinjiang. Check out the dudes at the U.S. Open sporting the swoosh on their shirts, shoes and more. They sure do strike a manly pose.</p><p>Roger Ruvolo</p><p>Riverside, Calif.</p>",
