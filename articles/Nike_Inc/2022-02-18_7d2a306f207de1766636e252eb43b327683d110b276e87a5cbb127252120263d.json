  "text": "<p><strong>One big scoop start:</strong> Novalpina, the private equity firm behind Israeli spyware maker NSO Group, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/3235089c-68cd-4620-b02f-211d3e130aec?\">held talks to buy a landmine clearance company</a> that works for Saudi Arabia in Yemen — a divisive deal that contributed to the group's unravelling, DD's Kaye Wiggins reveals.</p> <h2>Carl Icahn: made in America</h2> <p><strong>AT&amp;T </strong>can breathe a sigh of relief that it's (probably) safe from an activist attack by <strong>Carl Icahn</strong>. </p> <p>The 86-year-old corporate raider is the star of a new documentary that debuted earlier this week on the telco's prestige network HBO entitled <em>Icahn: The Restless Billionaire</em>.</p> <p>Icahn has been busy promoting the project in television appearances this week and through his Twitter account. His enthusiasm should not be surprising. The project, from <strong>Bruce David Klein</strong>, is a mostly sympathetic treatment of the financier's seminal — if polarising — career.</p> <p>Icahn let cameras into his seaside mansions in the Hamptons and Miami as well as his wood-panelled offices at the <strong>General Motors</strong> building in Manhattan (some home movies featuring his children conjure up images of the opening credits of HBO's hit corporate dramedy <em>Succession</em>).</p> <p>Through much of the 105-minute film, Icahn recounted — in his signature candour — a rags-to-riches story built from terrorising feckless CEOs. That access, deliberately or not, left less time to consider the discontents found in the wake of a guy who displays a sofa pillow embroidered with the statement, “Happiness is positive cash flow”.</p> <p>The contours of Icahn's life are well known to those who follow Wall Street: A modest upbringing in Far Rockaway, Queens, where he excelled in school — a path that took him to <strong>Princeton</strong>. </p> <p>But hearing Icahn chat wistfully about his days as a teenage cardshark and disobeying his mom by dropping out of medical school makes for good TV. The doc shoots back and forth between these personal reminiscences and footage of him, say, trashing the flight attendants' union in the 1980s.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Icahn is the rare 1980s raider who has remained relevant for decades. Klein spends meaningful time chronicling Icahn campaigns from <strong>Texaco</strong> and <strong>TWA </strong>to <strong>Apple </strong>and<strong> Herbalife</strong>. Outside voices of some prominent journalists — The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin, <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> author Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal's Cara Lombardo and the FT's Rana Foroohar — confirm throughout the film that Icahn is indeed a transcendent force in American capitalism worthy of generalist, highbrow television.</p> <p>The project nods at questions of greed, short-termism and inequality. Icahn himself acknowledges these hot-button topics. Yet the project is not ultimately intended as a critique of Wall Street excess, but rather the chance to hear a larger-than-life American speak in his sunset. And that may be good enough.</p> <h2>Peloton's tour de trouble</h2> <p>Wall Street's relationship with<strong> Peloton </strong>has been an unusually tight one for most of the decade since <strong>John Foley </strong>cooked up the idea of streaming spin classes to slick bikes in people's homes. Bankers, investors and other hard-charging finance types were among the early converts to what some call “the Church of Peloton”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company's $8.2bn IPO in 2019 was underwritten by<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>and no fewer than 18 other Wall Street firms. By then, “the Venn diagram of people who invested in Peloton and the people who owned Peloton was almost complete overlap”, noted<strong> Simeon Siegel</strong>, a<strong> BMO Capital Markets </strong>analyst. </p> <p>Since then, Peloton has been on one of the wildest pandemic rides of any stock. And, as Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, Patrick McGee and Joshua Franklin explain in<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3693cfe-ad2a-44d5-a447-46fc4edf6937\"> this FT Weekend Magazine story</a>, it's as much a story about Wall Street's expectations as it is about our lockdown workouts.</p> <p>Investors' belief that Covid had permanently changed the way we exercise propelled Peloton to a valuation of nearly $50bn by late 2020. Foley, its co-founder and chief executive, was sure that this was just the start. “Last year I was talking to our board and I was like, I see this as clear as day, this thing is going to be one of the few $1tn companies in 15 years,” he told <strong>Dan Dees</strong>, <strong>Goldman</strong>'s co-head of global investment banking, in October 2020.</p> <p>What happened next, though, slammed the brakes on the market mania. Demand slowed, unchecked costs outstripped flagging revenues — and Mr Big Peloton-ed his way to an untimely death in the December 2021 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab2f65d0-9063-4eef-9747-9d2dadc4d8bc\">reboot</a> of <em>Sex and the City</em>.</p> <p>Unknown to outsiders, the story reveals Peloton's customer-first culture was also fraying: when warehouse workers spotted that many bike frames had rusted, the company didn't not scrap them. Instead, it launched “Project Tinman”, telling them to cover the rust with sealant and ship the bikes to customers.</p> <p>A plunging share price also triggered margin calls for some executives who had borrowed against their stock, the FT revealed. </p> <p>Foley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f316e3a0-9bae-4ff5-bc79-5a28e18b786b\">ceded</a> the CEO's job to <strong>Barry McCarthy</strong>, a veteran of<strong> Netflix</strong> and Spotify, but Peloton still has to deal with an activist investor and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/297e4161-2243-49c5-b6c0-6a054a20c17f\">bid speculation</a> after the FT and others reported interest from <strong>Nike </strong>and <strong>Amazon</strong>.</p> <p>McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/034ef665-6604-4cb9-b1af-b09e8b5ede39\">told the FT</a> that his intentions aren't to sell. What convinces him that the fitness group has a future is a devotion to the product that many on Wall Street will recognise. “It is a religion,” he says. “If we can't figure out what to do with that, then shame on us.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>The Department of Justice</strong> has appointed <strong>Eun Young Choi</strong> as its first director of the national cryptocurrency enforcement team. She previously served as senior counsel to deputy attorney-general <strong>Lisa Monaco</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>One Rock Capital Partners</strong> has hired <strong>Sally Cunningham </strong>as an operating partner.
