  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>:<strong> Ernst &amp; Young </strong>and three audit partners have settled charges with the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> for alleged misconduct in their relationship with the chief accounting officer at a large US company. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3be5c18-4267-4ce3-ac5c-a9114cb00560\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Dealmakers' pay is going up. Is it perpetuating a cycle of burnout?</h2> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has finally cracked and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">joined the arms race</a> over junior staff salaries.</p> <p>Having resisted mid-year increases, the bank has now decided to offer one of the most generous starting packages in the industry: $110,000 base salary for first-year analysts, $125,000 in the second year, and $150,000 for more senior associates, all before bonuses.</p> <p>The late-pandemic dealmaking boom is fuelling similar inflation among corporate lawyers, with firms <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/046d42d1-ec0b-4649-af6a-592430b5668c\">ratcheting up salaries</a> for recently qualified staff.&#xa0;</p> <p>In June, elite US firm <strong>Milbank</strong> set a $200,000 salary benchmark for first-year associates, which was immediately topped by rival <strong>Davis Polk</strong> — only for Milbank and others to match the higher figure.&#xa0;</p> <p>One person involved in negotiations at Goldman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239631a3-c42d-4ce4-9dc5-1e3cc71ca0e9\">told the FT</a> earlier this month that the bank should stick to increasing pay at the end of the year based on performance, rather than midway through, arguing: “If you behave like that, you simply end up with mercenaries.”</p> <p>Overworked mercenaries, at that. Goldman is in part responding to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab0f26a8-bb4c-4fdd-9e2f-b7271e7bf3b3\">complaints</a> from junior staff about burnout.&#xa0;</p> <p>But in his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/071c6656-8b3f-4475-9b3d-db0e4918baaf\">latest column</a>, the FT's Andrew Hill writes that advisory firms could be accelerating a vicious cycle.</p> <p>Law firms and investment banks may be paying more to their juniors, but the trade-off is that they must work longer hours, often remotely. That means they're more likely to burn out early, leading to higher pay to plug the gaps, and so on.</p> <p>To some extent, it's always like this during an M&amp;A boom. The actions of deal-hungry firms are economically rational because the alternative is to lose business. But industry analysts warn that juniors, and their firms, are striking a Faustian bargain.&#xa0;</p> <p>As the cycle turns, banks and lawyers may look to reduce fixed costs by laying off staff. The firms also risk rushing through hastily constructed deals that fall apart later. The devil, as they say, is in the detail.</p> <h2>Square strikes Australia's largest deal ever with Afterpay</h2> <p><strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> is going big on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a09dd665-1b76-478c-a50d-e40340b29b7b\">“buy now, pay later”</a> boom.</p> <p>Six months after the founder of mobile payments company <strong>Square</strong> acquired a majority stake in <strong>Tidal</strong>, the struggling streaming platform owned by <strong>Jay-Z</strong>, he's now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bc49035-87f8-440e-9c20-5af34d40d4ad\">paying $29bn</a> to buy Australia's <strong>Afterpay</strong>, the largest deal ever in the land down under.</p> <p>The Tidal acquisition <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10ca8739-4a09-4286-919f-7d99d3c5e600\">didn't make much sense</a> to most of us on team DD as well as investors, but the dollar size was so insignificant — less than $300m, compared to Square's more than $100bn market value — that nobody appeared to really care.</p> <p>Afterpay, which allows customers the option to pay for goods in four instalments, without interest if the payments are made on time, is a better fit.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a big, fast-growing company, it's the kind of transformational deal that could make or break Square. There is some debate as to whether the company has overpaid.&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal values Afterpay at a 30 per cent premium to its most recent share price.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company, which has never turned a profit, also has strong competition from the likes of Sweden's <strong>Klarna</strong>, which was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f73b352-723f-471b-b098-5f090279b5bb\">valued at $45.6bn</a> in June, and <strong>Affirm</strong>, the consumer lender led by PayPal co-founder <strong>Max Levchin</strong>.</p> <p>Investors endorsed the takeover, pushing Square's stock price up 11 per cent. But as deal watchers know all too well, big transactions are historically hard to pull off.&#xa0;</p> <p>And unlike Afterpay's customers, Dorsey's Square will have to pay upfront to get the deal done, albeit in stock rather than cash.</p> <p>Square has had a good pandemic. Its market value has grown fivefold since March 2020 as more people and businesses started using its services.&#xa0;</p> <p>So using its stock as a dealmaking currency makes sense as it tries to win market share from rivals such as <strong>PayPal</strong>, as well as take a bite away from a business traditionally dominated by credit card players like <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>Mastercard</strong>.</p> <p>The card companies will be particularly concerned about Square's move into the credit game since regulators seem to have de facto blocked them from doing similar deals due to antitrust concerns (in January, Visa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e10a83d4-b651-4097-b867-a6b42e21fb09\">called off</a> its deal to buy <strong>Plaid</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75c80e60-364f-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">for $5.3bn</a> after the US <strong>Department of Justice</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03bbf74e-697b-4989-8942-98e6a327e87d\">sued to block</a> the transaction).&#xa0;</p> <p>Square is unlikely to face any particular pushback from competition watchdogs, an opportunity Dorsey plans to take full advantage of before anything changes.</p> <h2>Hedge funds take a page from the private equity playbook</h2> <p>Hedge funds, once considered the “masters of the universe”, have long looked on enviously at the private equity industry.</p> <p>While buyout firms have for years enjoyed high fees, high returns and longer-term commitments from investors, hedge funds have often struggled to make money or attract investors in unpredictable public markets.</p> <p>So it makes sense that hedge funds are now trying to replicate the success enjoyed by their private equity counterparts, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3684cf6-e95a-4e12-8848-0a38516792a4\">writes the</a> FT's Laurence Fletcher.</p> <p>Big-name firms such as<strong> Marshall Wace </strong>and <strong>Third Point </strong>are among those to have recently launched funds, while ex-hedge fund manager <strong>Mike Platt</strong>, whose<strong> BlueCrest Capital</strong> is now a family office, says it's “a significant focus” for him.</p> <p>The benefits are obvious. Just take a look at some of the hedge funds that have been playing in private markets for years, such as the so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1d1c558-9a87-4843-9cd8-29ab203b7911\">Tiger cubs</a> — <strong>Tiger Global</strong>, <strong>Viking Global Investors</strong> and <strong>Maverick Capital</strong> — who have posted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">impressive gains</a>.</p> <p>Hedge funds think they can get an informational advantage about their listed investments by talking to private companies, which aren't bound by the same disclosure rules as their public market peers.&#xa0;</p> <p>But those rushing to juice up their returns should also bear in mind the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, when many such private assets became near-impossible to sell and funds had to restrict investors' access to their cash.</p> <p>Star Australian trader <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6868b46e-0d88-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2\"><strong>Greg Coffey</strong></a>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7547b8e-32f8-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2\">pre-crisis bet</a> on a 25 per cent stake in Siberian coal mine <strong>Sibanthracite</strong> is perhaps the most famous example. The vehicle that held that stake only made the final repayments to investors in recent years.</p> <p>This time round, however, hedge fund managers insist their assets and liabilities are far-better matched. The next crisis will test that.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Michaela Wood </strong>has joined <strong>KKR</strong> to work on UK deals, as well as investments in business services companies across Europe.
