  "text": "<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet Joe Biden and address Congress in Washington later today <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e106d68d-0a79-4338-9343-955d8badbdf4\">on his first trip out of Ukraine</a> since Russia's full-scale invasion.</p> <p>Biden will announce nearly $2bn in new security assistance, including the Patriot missile defence system, following the meeting with Ukraine's president. </p> <p>Zelenskyy will then participate in a joint session of Congress before he heads back to Ukraine, wrapping up a short and high-stakes visit that was shrouded in secrecy owing to security concerns.</p> <p>The visit comes as Congress is on the verge of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29bb08c5-dff9-4590-8cdb-00386fad9c91\">approving a $1.7tn annual spending bill</a>, including $45bn in new military and economic aid to Ukraine.</p> <p>Passage of the legislation, which is backed by the White House, is expected in the coming days as the final act of Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate before Republicans take control of the lower chamber early next year.</p> <p>The Zelenskyy visit to Washington comes after the top Republican in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, said it would become more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/188401b5-229e-490a-9254-42167735d030\">difficult to pass additional assistance</a> to Ukraine next year, when his party takes control of the House.</p> <p>But the US and its allies continue to back Ukraine financially and militarily as the war approaches the 10-month stage despite its damaging economic consequences.</p> <p>When he launched the Russian invasion Vladimir Putin expected the conflict to be over in weeks. But the gains have been smaller than planned and the loss of lives higher. Yesterday Putin called the situation in Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7815d37-97e4-4658-bed4-402b4811f012\">“extremely complicated”</a>. </p> <p>Chinese president Xi Jinping, one of Putin's few supporters, today <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1875351a-187c-47d8-b911-37d4d730cc5c#post-dc9bf45a-52ba-41e9-8cef-69ac8d60bc89\">reiterated his call for peace talks</a> between Russia and Ukraine after holding surprise talks with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in Beijing. </p> <p><em>For the latest updates on the war's progress go to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4351d5b0-0888-4b47-9368-6bc4dfbccbf5\"><em>our visual guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>House committee votes to release Donald Trump's tax records</strong> After a closed-door meeting the ways and means committee voted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bafd577e-43ac-4690-8b53-3dc8e8751a26\">to release the former president's tax returns</a> covering the years 2015 to his last full year in the White House in 2020. The records are expected to be published in the coming days once sensitive personal information has been removed. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Elon Musk vows to step aside as Twitter CEO</strong> The Tesla and SpaceX boss tweeted last night that he would resign as soon as he has found someone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b453160-bf13-4eae-918a-1c7cdbfbeae6\">“foolish enough to take the job”</a>. The tweet follows the result of a poll that drew 17.5mn votes on Twitter, with 57.5 per cent backing his departure. The slide in Tesla shares, meanwhile, continued yesterday. The electric car company has lost two-thirds of its value since Musk completed his $44bn takeover of Twitter and is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f051e02-da07-4d7f-a2fc-0a62b96cc790\">worth less than ExxonMobil</a>.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Global media groups shed $500bn in value in September</strong> More than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f2b787-283f-4872-916f-92d096fc7120\">$500bn has been wiped off the market value</a> of the world's biggest media companies this year as investors sour on the streaming revolution. Intensifying competition, rising costs, belt-tightening by consumers and an advertising slowdown have also weighed on the industry.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Billionaire agrees to buy Phoenix Suns and Mercury basketball teams</strong> Mat Ishbia, chief executive of Detroit-based United Wholesale Mortgage, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fbd327e-ba8e-4536-8aa4-38be4a305df6\">has agreed to acquire</a> the Phoenix Suns and Mercury basketball teams for $4bn, in what would be a record transaction for a National Basketball Association franchise. The NBA suspended current owner Robert Sarver in September for using racist and bullying language.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Departing fund chief warns about consolidation trend</strong> Cyrus Taraporevala, who this month stepped down as chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, which has $3.3tn in assets, said a wave of consolidation in his sector risked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18d37c4f-0e7f-4d84-945b-4ed2efa1e70f\">blunting firms's edge in an increasingly competitive market</a>. Attempts by asset managers “to be all things to all people” were misguided, he told the FT.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried faces second court hearing </strong>The FTX founder is due to appear in a Bahamas magistrates' court this morning after signing the legal documents that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f8c50bc-adeb-4ace-a155-eacc13ed2c18\">pave the way for his extradition to the US</a>.</p> <p><strong>Nike shares rally</strong> Nike shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bd98ddd-d141-403d-99f3-9eaeda5817d4\">rose nearly 13 per cent</a> after the market closed yesterday. The US sportswear brand's quarterly earnings beat expectations as North American consumers stocked up on footwear ahead of the festive season. Cruise operator Carnival releases earnings later.</p> <p><strong>Capitol riot report released</strong> The congressional committee investigating the January 6 2021, attack on the US Capitol will release its full final report after it unanimously recommended on Monday to the Department of Justice that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65adf18f-5d4d-44fd-8a32-0bf8cbd25833\">four criminal charges</a> be brought against Donald Trump.</p> <p><strong>Economic indicators</strong> The Conference Board updates its index tracking US consumer confidence while figures are also due on existing home sales. In Canada, inflation data covering November will be released after consumer prices rose in October.</p> <p><em>Join FT Live at Davos for a number of in-person and digital events alongside the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting from January 16 to 20.

Yet the year also brought <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbe6533e-ab61-44bd-8866-fc59b6089cc7\">signs of hope</a>, writes Martin Wolf.</p> <p><strong>The meaning of Ron DeSantis</strong> If Trump did not exist, you might describe Ron DeSantis's philosophy as fossil-fuel Christian nationalism, writes Edward Luce. Its enemies are amoral tech oligarchs, Big Pharma, ESG-endorsing finance, the corporate media and elite universities. The difference lies in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/068faf68-55b7-4a5c-a144-12503fe34e02\">the competence of the execution</a>, says Luce. </p> <p><strong>US targets China's potential chip stars with new restrictions</strong> The US started using export controls to rein in China's technological rise by putting Huawei on the entity list in May 2019. Since then, Washington has added more and more Chinese tech enterprises and last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0693edbb-d3d5-4e15-9c33-08f82e6460bc\">targeted the high-end semiconductor industry</a>. “It is a game of whack-a-mole,” said one expert.</p> <p><strong>Lessons from the gilts crisis</strong> Signs of financial instability have recurred since the gilts crisis in the UK, which stemmed from pension funds' so-called liability-driven investment strategies. The meltdown in September was an early warning about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a2e7a9b-d984-45c1-8ada-0d0a6e57911b\">radical changes in financial markets</a> and suggests pension systems might not be fit for purpose.</p> <p>‘<strong>Grief tech' avatars aim to take the sting out of death</strong> The trend towards <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9864b6ca-8c33-469c-97ab-b7b5cb49d424\">AI-assisted grieving and “grief tech”</a> could soon allow those left behind to interact more vividly with the dead. Companies such as HereAfter AI are building “legacy avatars” of living people that can be called upon after their passing to console the bereaved.</p> <h1>Best TV shows of 2022</h1> <p>The FT called <em>The Bear</em>, a comedy-drama set in a Chicago restaurant, “one of the best new series of the year”. It is among <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f42a2bc-b722-45e7-b09b-95c261763ba2\">2022's television highlights</a>.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Sophia Smith 2022 'FirstFT: Mr Zelenskyy goes to Washington' FT.com 21 December.
