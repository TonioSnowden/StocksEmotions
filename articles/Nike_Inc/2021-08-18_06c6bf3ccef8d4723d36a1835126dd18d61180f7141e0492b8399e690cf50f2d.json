  "text": "<p>Shares of Li Ning, named after the gymnast who founded the company, have gained 983% since the end of 2018. Shares in Anta, which owns the Fila brand in China, have more than quadrupled over the same period.</p><p>The sector is riding some near-term tailwinds. As part of a five-year mass fitness program announced this month, the government said it would build more fitness facilities and encourage people to exercise. Beijing aims to grow the sports industry to 5 trillion yuan, the equivalent of $772 billion, in 2025, which would be a 70% rise from 2019 levels. And at a time when regulatory concerns are clouding the outlook for many other sectors, in particular the internet industry, sportswear stocks look like a haven.</p><p>The backlash against foreign brands over their stance on the use of forced labor in China's Xinjiang region earlier this year provided a lift to their Chinese competitors. Nike and Adidas are China's top two sportswear brands, accounting for 43% of the market in 2020, according to Euromonitor International.</p><p>But the rise of Chinese brands predates the recent tensions. Anta's market share has risen from 11% in 2017 to 15% in 2020, according to Euromonitor. Li Ning's operating profit has been growing every year since 2015, when it emerged from three years of losses. The company's operating profit in the first six months this year has nearly quadrupled from two years ago, according to results announced last week.</p><p>One reason is that these Chinese brands are making products with better quality and design, shaking off their image of being cheap knockoffs.</p><p>That is reflected in their rising profit margins. Li Ning's operating margin in the first six months this year was 25%, compared with 4.2% five years earlier.</p><p>These brands are also better-versed in marketing to China's younger generation than Western competitors, using social media channels like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to interact with customers. Their products and marketing have featured more Chinese cultural elements.</p><p>Running with China's homegrown sports brands doesn't come cheap, however. Both stocks are getting expensive: Li Ning and Anta both trade at around 47 times their expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Chinese sportswear stocks offer a good growth story at a time when many previous market darlings are struggling, but the admission price is steep.</p>",
