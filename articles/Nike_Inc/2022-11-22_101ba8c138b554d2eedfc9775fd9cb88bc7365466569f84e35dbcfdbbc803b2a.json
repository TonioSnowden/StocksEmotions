  "title": "In Sam Bankman-Fried's T-Shirts, a Soured Sign of Charm; The FTX founder embodied Silicon Valley's disheveled-exec trope better than anyone. But as his crypto empire collapses, it all looks messier.",
  "text": "<p>There he was, dressed like a wayward college student next to Tony Blair and Bill Clinton on a conference stage, or appearing in a social-media video with Tom Brady (an FTX ambassador), or pitching his company on a financial-news network.</p><p>At times, Mr. Bankman-Fried seemed unfamiliar with how clothes were supposed to be worn. When he suited up to visit Congress in 2021, the laces of his dress shoes were tied in a tangle that looked like a pile of Silly String. Naturally, crypto fanboys turned his messy laces into a meme. Today you can still buy a sticker of the contorted shoelaces for $2.57 online.</p><p>Initially, Mr. Bankman-Fried's everyman shtick was compelling, if not outright endearing. Profiles of the mop-topped moneymaker nearly always mentioned his disarmingly juvenile uniform, often alongside his humble Toyota Corolla and penchant for sleeping on bean bags at FTX's office in the Bahamas.</p><p>\"He branded himself as a slob, and it makes him more authentic and people like it more,\" said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities who famously criticized Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook's early years for wearing a hoodie to rally Wall Street investors, calling it a sign of the budding exec's immaturity.</p><p>While he still thinks a startup founder's attire should match the decorum of a given meeting, Mr. Pachter noted that Mr. Bankman-Fried's persistent T-shirt wearing may have made him effective at getting money from equally dressed-down backers (the venture-capital space, after all, isn't exactly a hotbed of ties).</p><p>An adherent of the movement known as effective altruism, the FTX founder claimed he was amassing wealth just to give it all away. In a CNBC interview published two months before FTX's collapse Mr. Bankman-Fried said he planned to spend \"maybe like one percent\" of his fortune on himself.</p><p>His seen-better-days T-shirts, often with their collars stretched out from use, were a wearable demonstration of his personal thrift.</p><p>The seismic flameout of FTX—once valued at $32 billion, the company filed for bankruptcy and faces Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department investigations—helps deflate one of the startup world's great myths: the underdressed genius founder. Since Steve Jobs first shed his preppy bow ties in favor of futuristic Issey Miyake turtlenecks, Silicon Valley has swooned over founders who don't dress like the stodgy old suits. (More than a decade after his death, the fascination with Mr. Jobs's clothes is as strong as ever: This month, a pair of his threadbare Birkenstock sandals sold at auction for nearly $220,000.)</p><p>Savvy execs have since exploited the idea that wearing something off-kilter, and even slovenly, can draw in investors.</p><p>\"You don't want to look like you're trying too hard because you want to look like the time and your attention is going to the venture,\" said Laura Huang, professor of entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, in reference to the calculatedly casual look of founders such as Mr. Bankman-Fried.</p><p>Ms. Huang's research is in the \"gut feelings\" that investors use to make decisions about what companies to pour money into. She noted that everything from the gender of the founder to what they wear can impact how much an investor is willing to sink into a company. \"There's always gonna be perceptions and attributions that are being made,\" she said.</p><p>If there's one man responsible for popularizing the slovenly CEO myth it's Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore interchangeable, oh-so-average zip-up hoodies and gray T-shirts throughout Facebook's early years as he drummed up investment and pitched the company at tech conferences. The hoodie was as integral to the Facebook brand as the \"like\" button, presenting the CEO as someone with no time for frivolities like shirt buttons. When asked about his uniform in 2014, he said, \"I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community.\"</p><p>He spawned a legion of hoodie-wearing, keyboard-jockey clones, all out to prove that they too had no time for style when there was coding to be done. To this day, neutral T-shirts and drab hoodies of the Zuckerbergian variety proliferate at tech companies across the country.</p><p>For tech bros, \"it's popular to be antiestablishment, and attire is the first thing you see,\" said Mr. Pachter. \"If you don't dress the way they expect you to dress, [outsiders] look down on you and some people admire that because you're not bound by convention.\"</p><p>Then there's Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of biotech startup Theranos who more directly echoed the Apple founder by wearing similar black turtlenecks to the office and on the covers of magazines including Inc., Forbes and Fortune.</p><p>Both founders now face choppy waters. Meta, Facebook's parent company, has watched its stock lose nearly $800 billion in just over a year, as Mr. Zuckerberg has steered the company toward as-yet-unproven projects like the metaverse. And Ms. Holmes, who appeared in court in blouses not turtlenecks, was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison last week for four charges that she misrepresented her defunct startup's technology, finances and business prospects to investors.</p><p>If these examples prove anything, it's that execs in T-shirts and turtlenecks are just as capable of sending a company into a tailspin as those in Enron-era ties.</p><p>But norms are difficult to break down, particularly in Silicon Valley where founder origin stories are retold like biblical lore. It is unlikely that we'll see a pivot to suits from sweats anytime soon. \"There's a uniform—every profession has a uniform,\" said Prof. Huang of Harvard.</p><p>As Mr. Pachter pointed out, just as we've come to expect that Kylie Jenner will wear some kind of shapewear, or that Nike co-founder and former CEO Phil Knight wears sneakers, we anticipate that a startup savant will arrive at the next tech conference in some nothing-to-it tee. \"We just kind of expect them to dress in a fitting manner to represent the brand,\" he said. But old T-shirts are no guarantee of future results.</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How does a leader's style influence your confidence in them?
