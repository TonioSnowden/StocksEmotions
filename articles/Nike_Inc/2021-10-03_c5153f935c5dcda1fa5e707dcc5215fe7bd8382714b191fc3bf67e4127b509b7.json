  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>It could be said that science has been the theme of the past pandemic-filled 18 months, but over the next seven days this discipline will gain particular attention, alongside some new technology announcements. </p> <p>Firstly, it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/6ccba9db-254a-44d9-9aea-abe42be378f5\">Nobel Prize</a> week, with the gongs for physics, chemistry and medicine being named by the judging committee in Stockholm.</p> <p>Long gone are the days when operating system launches get the film premiere treatment — that peaked with Windows 95, which I attended as a young technology reporter at a gala event in London's Leicester Square. However, the unveiling of Windows 11 on Tuesday is still a significant moment for Microsoft, which hopes its new software will lift sales of a new range of laptops that go on sale the same day. This also seems a good moment to plug the very good <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5c8b92df81ab3b00044a2110\">#TechFT</a> newsletter.</p> <p>Prepare yourself also for political theatre from Boris “Follow the Science” Johnson. The British prime minister addresses the Conservative party's conference in Manchester on Wednesday. Expect some trademark boosterism about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61253aad-bcb7-4c2c-994f-a382d68729bb\">green technology</a> ahead of the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow, which starts at the end of the month.</p> <p>Thanks to all who have, through the power of internet technology, shared your views on The Week Ahead, enabling us to add our own upgrades to this service. Email me: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a></p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>The Tesco juggernaut is gathering momentum again as will be witnessed from its earnings call on Wednesday. Away from the takeover battle for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">Wm Morrison</a>, its sales outperformance against rivals has been the key story of the first half, according to analysts at HSBC. </p> <p>Tesco's share price has barely moved recently, possibly because it is perceived as too big to be a target for private equity bidders. However, the stock may get a lift if the supermarket can produce an upgrade to its full-year expectations.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>The vaccine bounce is not quite going to plan in the UK. The evidence so far is that an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08276c3e-97ea-44d4-9dca-c5a0ed6b258d\">“autumn storm” is brewing</a>.
