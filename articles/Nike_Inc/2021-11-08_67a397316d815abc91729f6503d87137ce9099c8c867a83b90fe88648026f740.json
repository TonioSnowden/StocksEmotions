  "title": "Fed Officials Flag High Inflation and Some Warn of Rate Rises if Pressure Persists; Charles Evans, James Bullard and Patrick Harker say they expect inflation to moderate; Bullard and Harker voice support for rate increases if it doesn't",
  "text": "<p>When it comes to monetary policy and raising the short-term rate target, \"the exact timing of that rate path will depend on economic outcomes,\" Mr. Evans said. But he added, \"judging from where the economy stands today, it looks like we are in for a low-rate environment for some time to come.\" He told reporters after the speech he still had penciled in a first rate increase in 2023.</p><p>Mr. Evans, who currently holds a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, has long been one of the Fed officials who has been most skeptical about the need to lift rates. He has also worried in recent comments that once an inflation surge driven by temporary reopening factors abates, the economy could once again face forces that had kept inflation low relative to the Fed's 2% inflation target.</p><p>The Chicago Fed leader weighed in after last week's decision by the Fed to start slowing the pace of its bond-buying stimulus effort with an eye toward ending it by the middle of next year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week the Fed isn't ready to boost the cost of short-term borrowing, but many observers say high inflation might force the central bank into action next year.</p><p>Speaking on Fox Business Network, St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard repeated his view that while the job market hasn't fully recovered the positions it lost due to the pandemic, all evidence suggests the job market is very strong. He said that he is still looking for the Fed to raise rates twice next year but added that \"if inflation's more persistent than we're saying right now, then I think we may have to take a little sooner action in order to keep inflation under control.\"</p><p>\"We've got quite a bit of inflation here,\" Mr. Bullard said, with the core personal consumption expenditures price index likely to remain over 4% by the end of 2021, and \"we definitely want to see that come down closer to our inflation target.\" Mr. Bullard doesn't have an FOMC vote this year but he will have one in 2022.</p><p>Speaking separately at a virtual event, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said that if inflation pressures don't ease next year as he expects them to, he believes the central bank might have to boost rates.</p><p>\"Inflation is more widespread across products and services than it was earlier this year,\" Mr. Harker said. \"I am acutely aware that this period of rising prices is painful for many Americans,\" the official said, adding, \"I do expect inflation to moderate next year as supply chains come back online and bottlenecks ease.\"</p><p>But if it doesn't, the Fed will have to respond, Mr. Harker said. The policy maker, who doesn't currently have a vote on the FOMC, said, \"I don't expect that the federal-funds rate will rise before the tapering is complete, but we are monitoring inflation very closely and are prepared to take action, should circumstances warrant it.\"</p><p>The central banker also said the process of reopening the economy has been uneven.</p><p>\"Our recovery looks like a Nike swoosh drawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee....We're climbing undeniably upward, but it's a jagged path,\" he said. Mr. Harker sees the 2021 gross domestic product rise at 5.5%, with growth at 4% next year and between 2% and 3% by 2023. He also expects more workers to re-enter the labor force over time, improving the nation's employment outlook.</p><p>The comments from the regional Fed leaders came on a day when Richard Clarida, the Fed's second-in-command, also weighed in. He said inflation risks remain tilted to the upside and noted inflation is well over the Fed's target, adding, \"I would not consider a repeat performance next year a policy success.\"</p><p>Write to Michael S.
