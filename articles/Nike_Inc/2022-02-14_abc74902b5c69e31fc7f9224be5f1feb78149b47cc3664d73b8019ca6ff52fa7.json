  "title": "Business News: Sneaker Shops Wrestle Supply --- Nike, others' continuing production, shipping constraints squeeze independent boutiques",
  "text": "<p>Sneakersnstuff AB, a small chain of streetwear and sneaker stores with locations in Europe and the U.S., has faced delays on its Nike orders sometimes lasting several months, according to co-founder Erik Fagerlind. \"We still have to pay rent, we still have to pay the staff,\" he said, when a coveted shoe like a Nike x Sacai is delayed.</p><p>In a call with analysts in November, Nike said that factory closures in Vietnam as a result of the coronavirus and lengthy transit times had constricted the company's production capacity. On the call, Nike Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said the company was confident the supply chain would normalize heading into the middle of this year.</p><p>Supply-chain snarls are being felt across the footwear industry. In a call with analysts on Friday, Under Armour Inc. Chief Financial Officer Dave Bergman said the company was still experiencing supply constraints as a result of longer-than-usual transit times and higher freight costs. Mr. Bergman said these delays caused Under Armour to cancel some deliveries as a way to give priority to its direct-to-consumer business and top wholesale accounts.</p><p>In recent years, Nike has cut around half of its wholesale accounts in North America as it has put more emphasis on selling products through its own apps, websites and stores. Such direct sales now account for roughly 40% of its $44.5 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>While Nike has kept relationships with mainstream retailers like Nordstrom Inc. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., the company uses small-scale boutiques for introducing specialized, highly desirable designs like Dunks and Jordans that customers line up to purchase.</p><p>Sneaker collectors anticipate these releases for months, monitoring leaks of images and drop dates on Instagram and blogs dedicated to tracking Nike's next move. In the digital age, many stores employ online raffles to launch a shoe, giving customers an often-slim chance at buying a hot sneaker, where the supply is minuscule compared with the demand. Still, these premium stores also fall victim to the global supply-chain problems hitting the retail industry.</p><p>Mr. Fagerlind said Nike informs Sneakersnstuff of delays but the snags have helped to slow the business. Last year, Sneakersnstuff expected to increase sales by around 17% over the year before, but Mr. Fagerlind said sales grew closer to between 5% and 10%.</p><p>Mr. Fagerlind is understanding of Nike's current production predicament, which he felt has the company giving priority to its own stores over independent retailers.</p><p>Nike didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
