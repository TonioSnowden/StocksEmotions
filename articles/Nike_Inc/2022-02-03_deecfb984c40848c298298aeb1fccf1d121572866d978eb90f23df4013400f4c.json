  "title": "Washington Football Has a New Name: Commanders",
  "text": "<p>The team, which is keeping its burgundy and gold colors, said the new name pays tribute to the culture of leadership in the Washington area.</p><p>Now the newly minted Washington Commanders face the uphill climb of engaging with a fan base that was once one of football's most fervent, but has seen the club struggle on the field and found itself at the center of numerous controversies off of it.</p><p>In the past two years, Washington has been the subject of three crises: an investigation for widespread sexual and verbal harassment inside the workplace; a contentious and public dispute between owner Dan Snyder and his limited partners; and public pressure that finally forced the franchise to adopt a new name.</p><p>Snyder, the controversial boss at the center of all of these issues, had long vowed to never change the name.</p><p>Public pressure to change the name, though, wasn't new to the franchise. What changed was when some of the biggest financial partners of the team and the league took a stance on the matter.</p><p>FedEx -- the namesake of Washington's stadium and run by Fred Smith, one of the club's then-minority owners, who had been at odds with Snyder -- asked for a name change on July 2, 2020. Nike, the official apparel partner of the NFL, took the club's gear off its website. Other team sponsors, such as PepsiCo and Bank of America, joined the calls.</p><p>On July 3, 2020, Washington said it was launching a review of the name. Ten days later, it was officially dropped.</p><p>Before the 2020 season, the club decided to play as the Washington Football Team -- a moniker that became a placeholder and eventually a permanent option.</p><p>Other contenders had included the Armada, Presidents, Brigade, Red Hogs, Red Wolves and Defenders.</p><p>Then, after two seasons playing under the type of generic name that is more common in European soccer, the club chose Commanders. The club, in its release, said that the identity is \"personified by mission-driven players who take command, forge success and break barriers on and off the field.\"</p>",
