  "text": "<p>The company also said it could charge restocking fees, decline to issue refunds or suspend the accounts of people it determines are buying its shoes, apparel or other items with the intent to resell them.</p><p>Nike previously prohibited the purchase of products for resale but the update expands the company's restriction and what it might do in response. Its rules also banned purchases deemed to be fraudulent but didn't explicitly mention the use of software, known as bots.</p><p>A Nike representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The move comes as the $6 billion sneaker-resale market has seen exponential growth in recent years. Cowen analysts expect the market to grow up to $30 billion by the end of the decade.</p><p>On social media, resellers share their success of using bots to acquire limited-edition sneakers through digital platforms such as Nike's SNKRS app.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Nike Moves to Crimp Resellers and Might Cancel Orders Made Using Bots</p>",
