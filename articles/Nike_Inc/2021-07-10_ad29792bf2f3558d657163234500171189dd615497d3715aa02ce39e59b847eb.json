  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>the search for the next <strong>Sadio Mané</strong> or <strong>Yaya Touré</strong> is heating up. Next Thursday, the FT hosts a live online discussion on the hunt for talent across Africa. A stellar cast of speakers include: <strong>Kingsley Pungong</strong> and <strong>Leo Cullen</strong>, respectively CEO and COO of <strong>Rainbow Sports Global</strong>, former professional footballers <strong>Eniola Aluko</strong> and <strong>Mikaël Silvestre</strong>, as well as <strong>Ebru Köksal</strong> of the <strong>Professional Footballers Association</strong>. <a href=\"https://africanfootball.live.ft.com/page/1848813/register-for-free\">Register to watch for free here.</a></p> <p><em>In this edition of Scoreboard, we measure the financial impact of a Euro 2020 victory for Harry Kane and the England team, analyse the impact of private equity investors in the NBA, and more.</em></p> <h1>Winning counts most for Harry Kane and England</h1> <p>What's the price of football glory?</p> <p><strong>England</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06ae1a0f-2a6f-4fa5-926c-f7984b5939ad\">face</a> <strong>Italy</strong> in the <strong>Euro 2020</strong> final at London's <strong>Wembley Stadium</strong> on Sunday.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Azzurri are already one of the sport's most successful men's national teams, having collected four World Cups and a European championship. But for football-obsessed, glory-starved England, it will be the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a10e41d-40fe-4a3c-8eed-e2bb23fa110b\">first major final</a> in 55 years.</p> <p>The impact of victory is hard to measure. Economists suggest there isn't much of a boost from tournament wins. But as the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a589a9b-6cbc-4e3f-b937-7ccfe55c2274\">reported this week</a>, there are a host of societal effects from such national team triumphs, from a decrease in violent crime to a spike in the birth rate.</p> <p>For the team, in financial terms at least, much depends on the result.</p> <p>Take Kane, for example. The <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> striker is among the most famous people in his home country, enjoying lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of <strong>Nike</strong>, <strong>Lucozade Sport</strong>, <strong>Beats by Dr Dre</strong>, <strong>BT Sport</strong> and <strong>Hugo Boss</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even so, Kane does not appear on the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/athletes/list/#tab:overall\">Forbes list</a> of the world's top 50 highest earning athletes, a ranking topped by global superstars like Portugal's <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> and Argentina's <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.</p> <p>Unlike those players, Kane is not yet a winner of the sport's greatest prizes. Changing that could both increase his value in football's multibillion-euro transfer market — he has indicated a desire to leave Spurs for a better-resourced club — while attracting a host of new sponsors.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Below the Ronaldos and Messis, there are few with [significant personal endorsement] deals in football,” reckons sports marketing veteran <strong>Tim Crow</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>One clear victor would be the <strong>Football Association</strong>, the governing body that runs the England national team. It made nearly £53m in 2020 from its sponsorship contracts. In a coronavirus-hit year, the FA's overall revenues plunged by nearly £130m to £335m.</p> <p>A recovery could be mounted if sponsors flock to being associated with a winning side that also leads popular causes such as “taking the knee” to protest racism.</p> <p>“There is no question that this team's value is the highest asset of any team brand in this country,” said Crow. “Teams need to have a purpose; these guys have shown in words and deeds that they stand for something.”</p> <p><em>Read the FT's Person in the News profile of Harry Kane </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c062347a-d0ec-4d76-bda6-fc6f9f3ad237\"><em>here</em></a><em> and a Life and Arts essay on the history of English football </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a626d7e2-87d5-4759-8ed2-f7834eb725d8\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Endgame: the best of Euro 2020</h1> <p><em>A round-up of the of the FT's coverage of Europe's national football team tournament ahead of the final</em></p> <ul>  <li><p>Italy were made to “suffer” by <strong>Spain</strong> before winning on penalties in a tense semi-final. The FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06ae1a0f-2a6f-4fa5-926c-f7984b5939ad\">match report</a> concluded that the Azzurri fell back on ancient weapons of massed defence, brilliant goalkeeping and rapid counter-attacks. That was necessary due to Spain's ability to keep the ball. Remarkably, 18-year-old midfielder <strong>Pedri</strong> completed all 55 of his passes inside 90 minutes.</p></li>  <li><p>Spain's ball possession is typified by <strong>Sergio Busquets</strong>, the legendary <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> midfielder. Simon Kuper <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14758a4a-e4fd-40c5-a2ed-69470c30f898\">wrote</a> that thinking fast, being in the right place and knowing when to foul, more than makes up for his lack of athleticism and raw speed. At almost 33, Spain's exit means he is running out of time to add to a bursting trophy cabinet.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sadiq Khan</strong> said he was confident that the Euro 2020 final would be safe despite the decision to allow more than 60,000 fans to attend the match. The mayor of London <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15d7bc02-0dc0-400e-9e77-6ed246b9efba\">defended the move</a> and said he had spoken with the UK government about how to allow people to celebrate responsibly if England beat Italy. “But let's not count our chicks yet,” he warned.</p></li>  <li><p>UK prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>hasn't ruled out calling a national holiday if the Three Lions win at Wembley. He described <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a10e41d-40fe-4a3c-8eed-e2bb23fa110bnd%20were%20deserved%20winners%20against%20Denmark%20despite%20needing%20extra-time%20to%20seal%20the%202-1%20victory,%20wrote%20FT%20columnist%20Simon%20Kuper.%20Despite%20going%20down%20by%20a%20goal%20and%20reverting%20to%20kicking%20the%20ball%20long,%20an%20unrefined%20tactic%20that%20has%20made%20way%20for%20the%20modern%20pass%20and%20press%20game,%20the%20English%20players%20calmed%20down%20and%20remembered%20their%20training%20to%20close%20out%20to%20come%20back%20and%20close%20out%20the%20game%20with%20a%20fine%20passing%20move.%20Relive%20the\">England's win over Denmark</a> as “a total nail-biter . . . just euphoric”. Yet the team's advance was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74adeafa-e18b-4957-a1fd-ee0715cb9f50\">tarnished</a> by fans booing the Danish national anthem and disciplinary action by <strong>Uefa</strong>, European football's governing body, after a laser targeted goalkeeper <strong>Kasper Schmeichel</strong> in the run-up to England's penalty in extra-time.</p></li>  <li><p>England manager <strong>Gareth Southgate</strong> and his squad know their power and aren't afraid of using their platform, writes Gideon Rachman. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f177cfd0-24b8-49ba-bdd8-99b975828d23\">Politicians on both sides of the fence look on with envy</a>. <strong>Labour party </strong>sympathisers wish leader <strong>Keir Starmer </strong>could articulate “progressive patriotism” as well as the football team. Conservatives grumble that Southgate is a “tool of deep Woke”, a line that trended on Twitter.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Private equity's slam-dunk deals with NBA teams</h1> <p>Hours before the tip-off of their first <strong>National Basketball Association </strong>finals in 28 years, the <strong>Phoenix Suns</strong> got a financial boost: a minority investment from <strong>Dyal Capital</strong> that values the franchise at $1.55bn.*</p> <p>It was the latest in a string of ownership transactions within the NBA, which last year relaxed its bylaws to allow financial institutions to take passive, minority stakes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other teams welcoming such deals this year include the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong>, from <strong>Arctos Sports Partners</strong>, as well as the <strong>San Antonio Spurs </strong>who sold a stake to <strong>Sixth Street</strong>.</p> <p>All told — including sale of a minority share in the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> to individual private equity titans <strong>Todd Boehly </strong>and <strong>Mark Walter </strong>— more than $2.25bn in NBA franchise stakes have changed hands since the start of 2021, according to a Scoreboard analysis.</p> <p>The appetite private equity firms have for sports ownership was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ba35ff2-ac31-41d2-8ff9-6107a64d0ae5\">evident</a> by the end of last year. But with the current NBA season coming to a close, the perspective of these new institutional investors is starting to come into focus.&#xa0;</p> <p>One new NBA investor said that majority sale transactions, such as <strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>‘s acquisition of the <strong>Los Angeles Clippers</strong> or <strong>Joe Tsai</strong>'s purchase of the <strong>Brooklyn Nets</strong>, trade at ten times the team's annual revenues. But institutional investors can scoop up minority stakes for as little as half that multiple.&#xa0;</p> <p>Moreover, this person said, private equity firms haven't demanded additional perks, as individual owners might, such as locker room access to players, courtside seats or use of the team plane.</p> <p>Instead, private equity investors from different firms said that their focus is on improving non-sport elements of the business, such as in-venue experiences, helping teams expand their international fanbases, and even aligning with owners with similar political and social world views.</p> <p>Two investors point out that private equity-style management was already infiltrating the NBA, given the influx of individual majority owners who hail from the industry, such as <strong>Josh Harris </strong>and <strong>David Blitzer</strong> of the <strong>Philadelphia 76ers</strong>, and <strong>Marc Lasry </strong>and <strong>Wes Edens</strong> of the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong> — the Suns' opponents in the best-of-seven game finals.</p> <p>Some, like the Bucks, have already redeveloped the area around their stadium into a year-round commercial and event space.</p> <p>“Are [the owners] really running the Bucks that differently from the way they would run their firms?” asked one minority investor.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Japan declared a Covid-19 state of emergency that will run throughout the <strong>Olympic Games</strong>, which start on July 23, meaning they will be held <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af205e68-51e3-4165-b211-d22f9c3c86c8\">without spectators</a>. Prime minister <strong>Yoshihide Suga </strong>said the measure was required to control the spread of coronavirus, raising the likelihood that organisers will need a taxpayer bailout to refund ticket holders.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Formula One</strong> said the <strong>Australian Grand Prix</strong>, which had been scheduled for November, <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.australian-grand-prix-off-in-2021.395AJGygKsmWueNXHiZRUU.html\">has been cancelled</a> for the second consecutive year because of the pandemic. <strong>MotoGP</strong>, the motorcycle racing competition owned by private equity firm<strong> Bridgepoint</strong>, also cancelled its October race in Australia.</p></li>  <li><p>England's preparations for the one-day international cricket series against <strong>Pakistan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81de4456-25bf-4641-b063-f8c07872b0cf#post-7b56fe9b-09e0-4372-a1de-fa5aaa1c2fdc\">were dealt a blow</a> when three players and four staff members tested positive for Covid-19. Despite drafting in an entirely new team, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/57767176\">including five debutants</a>, England won by a big margin.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>British and Irish Lions</strong> rugby team is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/07/lions-match-and-tour-in-jeopardy-after-two-players-forced-to-isolate\">persisting with its tour</a> of <strong>South Africa</strong> despite significant disruption as a result of repeated Covid-19 outbreaks among players and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/57741576\">schedule changes</a> amid a rampant third wave in the host nation.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Emma Raducanu&#xa0;</strong>and&#xa0;<strong>Jack Draper&#xa0;</strong>were the pick of the British wildcards at this year's <strong>Wimbledon&#xa0;Championships</strong>. Raducanu advanced to the fourth round, while Draper took a set of world number one&#xa0;<strong>Novak Djokovic</strong>. Wildcards, essentially a special invitation to players without enough points to qualify for grand slam majors, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/860b0619-a10e-4f13-abee-c9f27d775b99\">grown in value in recent years</a> because of higher prize money now attached to the early rounds. But they conceal the financial strain on lower-ranked tennis players.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <p>As the Euros come to a close, we look back on the viral moments already produced by the finalists. They include <strong>Ciro Immobile</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_fwDcp97Ts\">Lazarus-like recovery</a> from injury when Italy scored against <strong>Belgium</strong>, <strong>Leonardo Bonucci</strong>'s reaction to an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samhuxley/status/1412530323678695426?s=21\">overzealous steward</a>, the thoughts of Italian supporters on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexofBrown/status/1412484247064092678?s=20\">pizza toppings</a>, a young England fan's reaction to being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcmotd/status/1413022953344847878?s=21\">gifted a shirt</a> from <strong>Mason Mount</strong>, and a <strong>TikTok</strong> meme based on <strong>Bukayo Saka</strong> frolicking in a pool on an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephmdurso/status/1412693126565793793?s=20\">inflatable unicorn</a>.
