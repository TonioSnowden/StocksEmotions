  "text": "<p>Good morning from Philadelphia, where the US college basketball tournament known as <strong>March Madness</strong> is heading into the final stretch. I'm here to document the action for a forthcoming feature in the FT Magazine, and as of press time the hottest ticket in town is a third-round game between the <strong>Saint Peter's Peacocks</strong> and the <strong>Purdue Boilermakers</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>If you're scratching your head and thinking, “who are these teams and what on earth is she talking about,” don't worry. Few Americans other than university basketball die-hards had even heard of Saint Peter's until last week, when the tiny Jersey City, New Jersey college knocked off the <strong>Kentucky Wildcats</strong>, the most successful team in the history of the sport. In the world of upsets, it's not far from <strong>North Macedonia</strong> eliminating reigning Euro champions <strong>Italy</strong> from 2022 World Cup qualifying.</p> <p>It really was a week for shocks, including the sudden retirement of the world's top-ranked women's tennis player, <strong>Ash Barty</strong>, who called it quits just two months after winning the <strong>Australian Open</strong>. Our correspondent in Oz, <strong>Nic Fildes</strong>, breaks down what's next for Barty and the <strong>Women's Tennis Association</strong> in a special dispatch for Scoreboard. But first, we take you inside the fraught and ferocious bidding for <strong>Chelsea FC</strong>, where two groups have advanced in the sale of the west London club. Do read on — <em>Sara Germano, US Sports business correspondent</em></p> <h1>What it will take to buy Chelsea</h1> <p>The £3bn sale of Chelsea football club moved one step closer this week, with two investment groups backed by US billionaires leading the pack in a hotly contested auction being handled by merchant bankers at <strong>Raine Group</strong>.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85584dae-10db-44dd-a922-e94047ce8606\">revealed</a> by the Financial Times, <strong>Todd Boehly</strong>, the financier and co-owner of baseball's <strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong>, is up against private equity tycoons <strong>Josh Harris </strong>and <strong>David Blitzer </strong>in the bidding for one of sport's highest-profile assets, although there's still an outside chance of a dark horse winner.</p> <p>Neither side can afford to rest on their laurels if they are to win the race to acquire the <strong>English Premier League </strong>side from Russian billionaire (and close associate of <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>) <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>, who's selling as a result of UK government sanctions against him.</p> <p>Already, US billionaires have turned to members of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3830c75c-a01e-48ea-b74c-58e8b5fe0195\">British elite</a> to put the shine on their bids, with Boehly winning the support of <strong>Times of London</strong> columnist <strong>Daniel Finkelstein</strong>, and the rival bid going for City grandee <strong>Martin Broughton</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Coe</strong>, <strong>World Athletics</strong> president.</p> <p>It's just one hint that this is a contest that won't be settled on price alone, and the stakes are high in a complex situation that has required the UK government to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5c50dde-d601-4ca0-9a69-d33a23a2a01f\">exempt</a> Chelsea from the full force of sanctions to avoid its collapse.</p> <p>According to people with knowledge of the matter, the onus is on bidders to show how much of the cash will go to charitable causes, most likely in Ukraine, and to set out how much they can afford to invest in the club and its <strong>Stamford Bridge</strong> stadium, which is crying out for expansion and modernisation.</p> <p>The importance of equity as opposed to debt-heavy offers was vital in the first round of bids, with an offer from <strong>Saudi Media Group </strong>ruled out because of its reliance on the latter form of financing.</p> <p>The watchful eye of Chelsea's supporters is also a key factor in the process, particularly with Raine and Abramovich reliant on obtaining special approval from the UK government to complete any transaction.&#xa0;</p> <p>That weakened a rival bid from the <strong>Ricketts </strong>family, owner of the <strong>Chicago Cubs</strong> baseball team. Chelsea fans have campaigned against the bid because of an Islamophobia scandal involving the family's patriarch. The Ricketts stressed that “racism and Islamophobia have no place whatsoever in our society”.</p> <p>Having decided that Abramovich can no longer own Chelsea, the UK government will be keen to avoid controversy over the identity of the next owner, piling the pressure on Raine and the American billionaires competing to own one of football's trophy assets.</p> <p>“The hard work begins now,” said one person close to the deal.</p> <h1>Going out on top: Ash Barty ends the tennis party</h1> <p>The decision by Ash Barty, the world's number one ranked women's tennis player, to retire at the age of 25 may have shocked the sporting world but it came as no surprise to those closest to her.</p> <p><strong>Craig Tyzzer</strong>, her trainer, told reporters this week that the first words that the tennis star said to him after winning the 2019 <strong>French Open</strong>, her first Grand Slam, were “can I retire now?”&#xa0;</p> <p>Once the Australian had achieved her ultimate goal of winning <strong>Wimbledon</strong> it was a “hard slog to keep her going” said Tyzzer. By the time she won the <strong>Australian Open</strong> in January, in what would prove to be her last game, Tyzzer said Barty was allowing her fans and the public to live vicariously through her. “I think the Australian summer was for everyone else and not for her,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>The exit of the world's number one ranked player, who has sat on top of the standings for three years, has left the circuit for the WTA poorer at a time when peers including <strong>Naomi Osaka</strong> have highlighted the mental and physical stress of competing at the top level.&#xa0;</p> <p>Professional tennis is gruelling for the hundreds of players who fly around the world on tour, <a href=\"https://channels.ft.com/en/ft-scoreboard/tennis-the-players-struggling-to-break-even/\">most of whom struggle to break even</a> financially.</p> <p>Barty has earned more than $23mn in career prize money and is among the most beloved athletes on the circuit — underscoring that even financial and sporting success may have their limits in terms of personal fulfilment.</p> <p>Famed for her consistency and her devastating backhand slice shot, Barty said there was no ulterior motive behind her decision to retire at the top. “I'm an open book. I've got no secrets,” she said at the press conference, playfully answering questions from reporters grasping for an explanation. </p> <p>“Timing is everything,” she said of the decision to retire from the sport a second time only two months after winning her home Grand Slam.&#xa0;</p> <p>Barty spent a year playing top-level cricket for the<strong> Brisbane Heat</strong> after retiring from tennis due to exhaustion and depression.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reporters asked whether the stress of dealing with tennis schedules distorted by the pandemic and Australia's strict lockdown rules in the past two years had contributed to her decision to quit by giving her a taste of life off the road. Henry Mance, the FT's chief features writer, makes the same <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02906fb5-3c12-4b04-bef2-e4a9ef8151f7\">points</a> in a column this week. He suspects, or hopes, Barty will return to tennis.</p> <p>Barty, who confessed to being a “homebody”, quipped: “Maybe my taste was the last time I retired.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet in sports mad Australia the decision to retire has left many second-guessing her next move. Speculation has been rife that Barty may rediscover her motivation by switching back to cricket, or golf or even Aussie Rules football — of which she is a huge fan — in her native Queensland. “Patience is a virtue,” she said when asked what her next chapter would be.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Fifa </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b88fc3cf-c90c-477a-80cb-6854e809b4b7\">agreed</a> a deal for <strong>Crypto.com </strong>to sponsor the<strong> World Cup </strong>in Qatar later this year, as sports continue to hoover up revenue from the fast-growing digital assets sector in a bid to recover and grow in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Crypto platforms have moved into sports sponsorship to build their brands.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nike</strong>, the sportswear brand, now makes more than 40 per cent of its revenue by selling sneakers and other kit directly to customers instead of via third parties, allowing it to maintain higher prices and collect valuable customer data. The FT's Lex column argues that challengers will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/015cb9f7-acba-48f4-a652-84511cd5ecd4\">struggle to compete</a> with Nike, which has $8.7bn of cash and equivalents to fuel further investment in growing direct sales.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Humphrey Cobbold</strong>, chief executive of <strong>PureGym</strong>, the UK's largest gym chain, tells the FT's Ian Johnston how he kept the business going during lockdowns, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d61e26da-a1dc-4c5d-bdd6-eefc0a916e4e\">obtained investment</a> from private equity firm <strong>KKR</strong> after a failed initial public offering.</p></li>  <li><p>In this special report, the FT looks at how <strong>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</strong>, now a Premier League club, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de31fe8e-6550-4f95-8c42-1c4b005fc0e3\">rose</a> from the lower divisions of English football to the top of the game, multiplying its revenues along the way.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jeff Zucker</strong>, the erstwhile <strong>CNN </strong>and <strong>NBCUniversal </strong>executive, is eyeing a pivot to the world of sports<a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/jeff-zucker-future-sports-cnn-warnermedia-1235211523\"> according to <em>Variety</em></a>. Zucker remains best known for casting <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on then-novel reality TV show, <strong>The Apprentice,</strong> in the early noughties. He recently resigned from his post at the helm of CNN after failing to disclose a relationship with the network's former chief marketing officer.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Chequered flag</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/1506331522420387841\">https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/1506331522420387841</a> <p>Seven world championships, 103 victories, 183 podiums. No amount of success can stop <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, <strong>Mercedes</strong>' <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/54923577\">record-breaking</a> <strong>Formula One </strong>driver. The hot Dubai sun would be a great excuse for most of us to lounge under an air conditioning unit, but for Hamilton it's just another excuse to get in some cardio. At the start of another long season, there's no doubt about his commitment. Expect more records to fall, even if the Silver Arrows haven't quite got their new car up to speed yet.</p><p>Source:  2022 'What it will take to buy Chelsea' FT.com 26 March.
