  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase shareholders have voted against the bank's executive pay plan, delivering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd34c86b-1253-467a-aa83-23a78b81fcb4\">a stinging rebuke</a> to chief executive Jamie Dimon and his management team.</p> <p>In a “say on pay” vote at the bank's annual meeting yesterday, only 31 per cent of investors voted in favour of JPMorgan's 2021 plan, which included a total $201.8mn package for six top executives. Dimon alone stands to make $50mn from a one-off special award.</p> <p>It is the first time the bank's board has lost such a vote since it was introduced in 2009. The lowest previous level of investor support in executive remuneration votes had been 61.4 per cent in 2015. In the equivalent vote in 2021, 90 per cent of shareholders voted in support of executive payouts.</p> <p>Of particular concern for investors this year was the award to Dimon, which the bank had said reflected the board's desire for the executive, whose wealth is estimated at $1.6bn by Forbes, to stay at the bank for a “significant number of years”. Dimon, 66, has been chief executive since 2005.</p> <p>The vote is non-binding, but the bank said in its proxy filing ahead of the meeting that its compensation and management development committee “will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements”.</p> <p><em>Thanks for all your emails following yesterday's interview with the New York City mayor.

The closely fought primary has been seen as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8980c08b-f36b-41af-bf56-bf32abeeea55\">crucial test of Donald Trump's influence</a> over the Republican party.</p> <p><strong>2.
