  "title": "Stocks Rise as Fears of Recession Ease --- Yield on 10-year Treasury note jumps after Powell signals quicker rate moves",
  "text": "<p>Nike advanced after the apparel maker reported revenue that beat analysts' expectations. Technology stocks also rose, as investors returned to faster-growing companies whose shares were battered earlier this year.</p><p>\"You're beginning to see a little bit of the revenge of growth stocks,\" said Wayne Wilbanks, co-founder and chief investment officer of Wilbanks Smith &amp; Thomas Asset Management LLC. \"Prices have collapsed, so valuations have gotten much better, to the point where that outweighs interest-rate concerns.\"</p><p>The stock benchmarks closed lower on Monday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was prepared to raise interest rates in half-percentage-point steps if needed to tamp down inflation. By Tuesday morning, though, investors were interpreting Mr. Powell's comments as a vote of confidence in the economy.</p><p>\"The message that came out of the [Fed] meeting last week is that they are going to be tightening [monetary policy] but the U.S. economy is resilient enough to withstand that,\" said Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight. \"The equity market chose to emphasize the economic resilience portion.\"</p><p>A selloff in government bonds intensified, sending the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 2.375% from 2.315% Monday. The yield on the benchmark note is now around its highest level since May 2019, before the pandemic upended financial markets. Yields rise when bond prices decline.</p><p>\"Looking at the market's leadership today, it's a mixed bag,\" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. \"The equity market appears tame, but the bond market doesn't.\"</p><p>Stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies have been whipsawed by volatility for the past month as investors have tried to assess the economic fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine. For the 39th time this year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closedwith a move of 1% or more, representing its most-volatile quarter since the first three months of 2009.</p><p>Many investors have feared that the war could keep inflation sustained and stunt economic growth in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>Investors are keeping a close watch on the yield curve, which measures the spread between short- and long-term rates and is often seen as an indicator of sentiment about the prospects for economic growth.</p><p>Recently, the gap between yields on shorter-term and longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds has been shrinking, stirring anxieties that the bond market is close to signaling a potential recession.</p><p>The two-year Treasury yield, which is especially sensitive to changes in monetary policy, climbed to 2.152% from 2.132% Monday.</p><p>Shares of banks rose. Financial stocks helped lead the S&amp;P 500's gains, with the sector rising about 1.6%. Wells Fargo jumped $2.25, or 4.4%, to $53.39, while Signature Bank rose $10.30, or 3.3%, $321.18.</p><p>Nike rose $2.90, or 2.2%, to close at $133.09.</p><p>\"Nike is the ultimate global company, as they sell and source all over the world,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. \"It's a great barometer, and they assuaged a lot of investors' concerns.\"</p><p>Communications and technology stocks also gained. Etsy rose $5.98, or 4.2%, to $148.25, while Match Group jumped $4.28, or 4.3%, to $104.31. Amazon.com climbed for a sixth consecutive day, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock closed at $3,297.78, up $67.95, or 2.1%.</p><p>Okta fell $2.98, or 1.8%, to $166.43 after a hacking group posted screenshots purporting to show that it had gained access to Okta.com's administrator and other systems. The company said that a preliminary investigation found no evidence of any malicious activity, adding that the screenshots were most likely related to a January security incident.</p><p>Bitcoin rose about 3.5% from its 5 p.m. level Monday to trade at $42,611. The price of the cryptocurrency has swung sharply within the past month but has largely traded above $40,000 since the middle of last week.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 increased 0.9%, rising for a fifth consecutive session. Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 2.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1.7% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.8%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.1%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
