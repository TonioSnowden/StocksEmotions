  "text": "<p>Adam Smith wrote that when businesspeople meet the likely outcome is a conspiracy against the public and higher prices. If the Scottish economist was right, reports by the Sunday Times of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea0c52f6-98ba-4bbe-8bb1-c336145dc94d\">meeting </a>in a car park between JD Sports' executive chair Peter Cowgill and Barry Bown who runs Footasylum, might raise eyebrows. </p> <p>JD Sports acquired Footasylum in 2019. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority subsequently blocked the deal in May last year; appeals followed. After a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/jd-sports-must-sell-footasylum-after-all-uk-regulator-says-2021-11-04/\">second investigation</a> last week, the watchdog ordered JD Sports, which is valued at £11.5bn, to sell off the small sportswear retailer. This demand followed a rebuke about discussing strategy while appeals were under way.</p> <p>Smith and the anti-trust textbooks may cavil. But this is an outsized to-do over a £90m deal for a target with a 5 per cent market share. If the CMA has an issue with shoes and pricing power it would be better off delving into suppliers such as Nike and Adidas.</p> <p>Capital markets rightly shrugged off the hoo-ha. Shares barely moved. Even if JD, which denies that the car park meeting involved any wrong doing, is forced to unwind the Footasylum purchase, that will barely dent the £8bn of sales it is expected to generate this year. </p> <p>Indeed, Footasylum would bring little to JD, aka the King of Trainers. Sales at Footasylum fell 7 per cent last year, despite people buying trainers as much as ever. Its Achilles heel was a failure to migrate sufficient buyers from store customers to online buyers. Online sales, though up by almost half in the pandemic year, failed to make up for the loss of store footfall.</p> <p>The CMA pointed to the risk that all shoppers would be worse off without the competition JD exerted on the company. But when added to the roughly one-quarter share of JD Sports, its fierce rival Sports Direct might well disagree. </p> <p>JD must now decide whether to appeal for a third time. The extra cost and effort of this seems a waste given the CMA's stubborn stance on competition for competition's sake. </p><p>Source:  2021 'JD Sports/Footasylum: car park chats embarrass bosses' FT.com 8 November.
