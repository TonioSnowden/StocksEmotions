Adidas sells Reebok for up to €2.1bn</strong> Adidas is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e945e880-0c0c-47d2-b5f0-028b34723d28\">selling</a> Reebok for up to €2.1bn to US-based celebrity and clothing licensing group Authentic Brands. The deal draws a line under the German sportswear maker's ill-fated $3.8bn acquisition in 2005 in an attempt to compete with rival Nike.</p> <p><strong>4. Insurance losses soar on extreme weather </strong>Wildfires, US winter storms and tornadoes in Europe helped deal an estimated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1053aebb-474f-4f35-9034-2475272404e1\">$40bn blow</a> to global insurers in the first half of 2021, the worst start to a year for natural catastrophe insurance in a decade. </p> <p><strong>5. China probably building new missile silo site, say experts</strong> US defence experts say China has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11a72ce9-d4c5-4e4b-b6d0-d6d391b471da\">probably started building</a> a new missile silo site, suggesting that Beijing is pursuing an even more rapid nuclear build-up than previously assumed.

Culture is part of it, though a sticky subject: dogs are sometimes seen as more disposable in the south, and treated as such, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6294024-2cb2-4b38-ac7e-2a991f9c6ac8\">writes Joshua Chaffin</a>, as he researched the origins of Louie, the Tennessee hound he adopted last year.</p> <p><strong>How Turkey became a tech star </strong>Since last summer, Turkish tech companies have seen their valuations vault above the billion-dollar mark, seen as the threshold for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1010e729-a33f-4fd8-acd6-e5391bca45e0\">start-up success</a>.
