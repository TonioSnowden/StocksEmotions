  "text": "<p>Matthew Friend, Nike's finance chief, said the company was monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of high inflation on demand. He said Nike would take a cautious approach in China given uncertainty around additional Covid disruptions.</p><p>He also said the company would be raising prices on some items by a mid-single digit percentage.</p><p>\"We will stay focused on what we can control,\" Mr. Friend said on a conference call.</p><p>For the quarter ended May 31, total sales decreased 1% to $12.2 billion. Net income fell 5% to $1.44 billion, or 90 cents a share. The fiscal fourth-quarter results were better than Wall Street analysts had predicted.</p><p>Revenue in the North American market, which accounts for the majority of total sales, declined 5% to $5.1 billion. Sales in China declined 19% to $1.56 billion, mostly because of Covid-19 restrictions in the country.</p><p>Sales jumped in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia, compared with a year ago.</p><p>Some retailers have reported having excess inventory and having to sell products at a discount.</p><p>Supply-chain disruptions are still having an impact on Nike's flow of goods, Mr. Friend said.</p><p>The company is paying about five times the prepandemic rate it paid to put its products in a container and move them from Asia to the U.S. Transit times remain elevated and aren't expected to significantly improve during the coming fiscal year.</p><p>The company reported a 23% increase in inventory in the May quarter compared with the prior year.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
