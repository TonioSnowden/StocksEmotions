  "text": "<p>\"We believe the inventory peak is behind us as actions we're taking in the marketplace are working,\" said Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>Executives said Nike was now expecting full-year revenue to grow by a percentage in the low teens when excluding currency fluctuations, an increase from its forecast in September of low double-digit percentage growth. The most bullish forecast reflects what Nike has seen from consumers starting in August through the first couple weeks of December, executives said.</p><p>Analysts have been watching Nike and other retailers for progress in trimming inventories as many consumers have shifted discretionary spending as inflation pounds their budgets.</p><p>Executives said that they've seen strong demand but the company is aware that economic issues facing consumers haven't abated.</p><p>Nike pared down its inventory levels from the first quarter but they remain elevated. The company said the value of its inventory was $9.3 billion in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up 43% from the prior year.</p><p>Finance chief Matthew Friend said inventory comparisons were distorted by last year's factory closures in Vietnam. The inventory levels seen for the most recent quarter were in line with the plans that the company set out 90 days ago, Mr. Friend said.</p><p>Nike executives have said the company started increasing discounts this past summer but it was looking to the fall quarter to aggressively clear out excess goods.</p><p>Nike's sales in North America rose by 30% from a year ago, boosted by markdowns, it said.</p><p>In the latest quarter, Nike posted net income of $1.33 billion, or 85 cents a share, compared with $1.34 billion, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $13.32 billion from $11.36 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Nike was projected to report earnings of $1.02 billion, or 65 cents a share, on $12.58 billion of revenue, according to analysts polled by FactSet.</p>",
