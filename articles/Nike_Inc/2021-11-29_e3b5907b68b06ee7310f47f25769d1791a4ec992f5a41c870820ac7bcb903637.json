  "title": "Fashion Designer Virgil Abloh Dies of Cancer at Age 41; Off-White founder shook up luxury category, became Louis Vuitton's menswear creative director",
  "text": "<p>\"He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art and culture,\" the post said.</p><p>Mr. Abloh spent his career moving freely between the worlds of fashion, art, hip-hop and skating culture, tying together those disparate strands in all his work. Off-White, the fashion house that Mr. Abloh founded, shook up the luxury-fashion industry with collections that featured sneakers and camouflage pants juxtaposed with evening gowns. Such flourishes are now common in the collections of the biggest luxury brands.</p><p>His design work was featured in exhibitions at London's Tate Modern and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Mr. Abloh also traveled the world as a DJ, performing in recent months in New York, Zurich, Kyiv and London.</p><p>\"I often refer to my career as a bit of a Trojan horse: It exists to traverse two spaces and allows other people to partake in it,\" Mr. Abloh said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September.</p><p>In July, Mr. Abloh sold a 60% stake in the Off-White trademark to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the Paris-based luxury conglomerate. Mr. Abloh was also the creative director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, LVMH's core brand and the top-selling label in luxury fashion.</p><p>\"Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom,\" said Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who is chief executive and controlling shareholder of LVMH.</p><p>Off-White generated €308 million in revenue, around $347 million, in the year ending Oct. 30, 2020, according to Italian corporate documents. New Guards Group, an Italian fashion company owned by Farfetch Ltd., operates Off-White and paid Mr. Abloh a licensing fee for the brand, an arrangement that can be terminated in 2026 by either party.</p><p>Virgil Abloh was born on Sept. 30, 1980, in Rockford, Ill., the son of immigrants from Ghana. He grew up a devotee of skateboarding and graffiti art, both of which suffused his work in fashion and industrial design. Mr. Abloh said his favorite clothing brands growing up were skateboard-fashion companies.</p><p>Mr. Abloh studied architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 2007, he was tapped by Kanye West to expand the pop star's activities into fashion and other areas outside hip-hop.</p><p>Mr. Abloh founded Off-White in Milan in 2013. The brand was named after the gray area between black and white, mirroring Mr. Abloh's philosophy of blending aesthetics from different worlds.</p><p>In 2018, LVMH named Mr. Abloh to be Louis Vuitton's menswear creative director, making him one of the most high-profile executives in luxury fashion. It was part of a trend of European luxury brands forming partnerships with Black artists and designers, seeking to woo younger shoppers with the aesthetic Mr. Abloh helped create. He became one of the few Black creative directors of a European luxury brand, alongside Olivier Rousteing at Balmain.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Abloh unexpectedly canceled a number of appearances at fashion shows and concerts. He said his doctors were recommending he take a break from his hectic schedule. \"Ultimately everything is fine, but the doctor told me 'this pace that you've sort of pushed your body—to fly all these miles, do all these different projects—is not good for your health' \" he told Vogue in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Abloh is survived by his wife Shannon Abloh, his children Lowe and Grey, his sister Edwina and his parents Nee and Eunice.</p><p>Virgil Abloh's Influence on Luxury Fashion</p><p>A look back at the designer's career, in articles selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Designer Virgil Abloh: 'I've Been Tapped With a Magic Wand' (Sept. 1, 2021)</p><p>* Virgil Abloh Sells Off-White to LVMH, Deepening Ties With Luxury Conglomerate (July 20, 2021)</p><p>* Fashion Designer Invests in Black Talent With Scholarship Fund, Mentoring (July 9, 2021)</p><p>* Designer Virgil Abloh on Kanye West, Louis Vuitton and Other Career Milestones (June 2, 2019)</p><p>* Louis Vuitton Appoints Virgil Abloh as New Creative Director (March 26, 2018)</p><p>* Why Nike Chose Virgil Abloh to Rethink Its Sneakers (Sept. 6, 2017)</p><p>Write to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com</p><p>Fashion Designer Virgil Abloh Dies of Cancer at Age 41</p>",
