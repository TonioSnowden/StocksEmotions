  "text": "<p>   Companies could get a better glimpse of their travel carbon footprint through a software tool in development that would put information about emissions for sustainable jet fuel at companies' fingertips. </p><p>   Delta Air Lines Inc., Chevron Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google this month said they are working on a pilot program that will track and analyze emissions data for flights using sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, providing a carbon footprint for the fuel's overall life cycle. The companies said they hope to create a common model that could be used by other organizations considering the use of SAF, in a bet that verifiable emissions information will be valuable as companies pursue carbon-reduction targets. </p><p>   Amelia DeLuca, Delta's managing director of sustainability, said demand for the service is expected to be driven by companies that send staff on business flights and want to log the resulting emissions, especially if they are paying extra for flights running on sustainable fuel. </p><p>   \"For those corporate travelers who have business travel emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is really the only [avenue] to achieve alignment with the Paris Agreement today in terms of bringing those emissions down over time,\" Ms. DeLuca said, referring to the international treaty that aims to limit global warming. </p><p>   Aviation contributes about 2% of carbon-dioxide emissions globally, and demand for air travel is projected to increase 3.6% annually over the next 20 years from a 2018 baseline, according to the latest forecast by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations' aviation agency, taking into account the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Expanding the use of alternative fuels has emerged as a potential route to emission reductions for the industry and its customers. </p><p>   Companies including software supplier Palantir Technologies Inc., computer maker HP Inc. and sportswear giant Nike Inc. have agreed to purchase sustainable fuel through carriers for their business travel. Around 7 billion liters of SAF have been presold in forward purchase agreements globally, the International Air Transport Association said this year. </p><p></p>",
