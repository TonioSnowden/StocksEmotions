  "text": "<p>   In Derek Ng's closet, backless Birkenstocks have trounced his once beloved Jordans. </p><p>   The 27-year-old customer service rep in Orlando, Fla., used to covet the latest boisterous Nike Dunks, but his allegiances have shifted lately to slip-on mules. He owns five pairs including Birkenstock's traditionalist Bostons, Merrell's Swiss-cheese perforated Hydro Mocs and a pair from British designer J.W. Anderson that recall a Technicolor doormat. </p><p>   In balmy Orlando, the shoes make sense -- Mr. Ng savors the occasional breeze whispering at his heels. But it's about more than climate. He also finds mules conceptually \"more interesting\" than whatever new Jordan colorway is hitting stores. </p><p>   We are in a maximalist mule moment, with labels from Adidas to Saint Laurent going backless en masse. While a mule refers to a shoe without a heel covering, many aficionados call any slip-on that isn't a loafer or traditional dress shoe a mule. Clogs with a backstrap or a slight heel notch are \"a mule's best friend,\" according to Noah Thomas, men's associate fashion director at Macy's, and therefore up for inclusion. </p><p>   A mule is \"the thing that you need now,\" just as a hoodie or a sneaker was in years past, said Mr. Thomas, who also co-runs the popular Instagram account MuleBoyz. The page, which he operates alongside Jian DeLeon, fashion and editorial director of Nordstrom is a compendium of this mule-mad time. </p><p>   There are pricey fashion mules and thrifty sporty ones. Marni sells $580 mules coated in a Muppet-esque shag, while Dior partnered with Birkenstock on a felted wool model that, despite its $1,100 price tag, has sold out online. Far down the budgetary slope, Converse and New Balance sell heelless versions of their iconic styles for around $100 or less. </p><p>   Mr. Thomas himself owns about 30 pairs of mules. His overall favorite is a pair of polyurethane Birkenstocks with a slight ridge on the back -- mules, he cautioned, tend to slip off as easily as they slip on. \"It's a true shoe of leisure,\" he said. Running in them is out of the question. </p><p>   Birks and Crocs have existed for decades, but the pandemic lifted this relatively niche category into a genuine mulement. Dress shoes gathered dust as people drifted toward squishy-soled, easy-on shoes for shuffling to and from the supermarket -- mules being functionally a slipper with a hard sole. </p><p>   \"The pandemic definitely played a part in creating a lot of love\" for mules, said Dom Guerrero, 23, an assistant at a financial firm living in Vallejo, Calif. He was won over by Yeezy's spongy Foam Runner and now owns a multitude of slide-in clogs from Merrell and Crocs. As Mr. Guerrero succinctly said, \"It's all about comfort, dude.\" </p><p>   Interest in mules continues to climb. As \"a positive indicator of sales, Crocs and Birkenstock currently see lower levels of discounting compared to the overall footwear market,\" said Katharine Carter, fashion and retail analyst at Edited, which tracks sales data from a range of online retailers. </p><p>   For brands, trendiness breeds competition. At an accelerated clip, mules are taking a similar route to sneakers: becoming progressively gaudy, gigantic and/or generally odd. During men's fashion week in Paris last month, Belgian designer Dries Van Noten rolled out square-toed, flame-stitched backless cowboy boots and Louis Vuitton introduced a madcap new clog at monster-truck proportions. </p><p>   As Mr. Thomas said, \"Fashion loves ugly -- and mules, I think for a lot of people, are ugly.\" </p><p>   For that certain kind of clog consumer, weirder shoes win. Sometimes people peer at A.J. Ranzato's spongy Fear of God slides and say they look like hospital shoes. The 28-year-old search-engine optimization manager replies, \"I know, and I love them.\" </p><p></p>",
