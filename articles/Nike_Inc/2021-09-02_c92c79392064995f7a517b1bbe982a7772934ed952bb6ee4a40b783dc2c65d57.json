  "text": "<p>JD Sports could be forced to sell Footasylum after the UK's competition regulator reiterated that the £90m acquisition of its smaller rival would harm consumers, despite parts of its original conclusion being rejected on appeal.</p> <p>“Since our original inquiry, we have gathered a significant amount of additional evidence, including on the impact of coronavirus, and we still have concerns about JD Sports' takeover of Footasylum,” said Kip Meek, chair of the group conducting the Competition and Markets Authority's review. </p> <p>“This deal would see Footasylum bought by its closest competitor and, as a result, shoppers could face higher prices, less choice and a worse shopping experience overall.”</p> <p>The case has dragged on for more than two years after the original transaction was completed, with interested parties now invited to comment on the CMA's proposed remedies by September 9. A final report will be published in October, but the regulator has already stated that it regards divestment as the only viable remedy. </p> <p>Potential buyers from within the sportswear industry may also face competition inquiries. </p> <p>In its revised report, the CMA agreed that the sportswear manufacturers such as Nike and Adidas had increased their direct-to-consumer offerings during the Covid pandemic and that this had made Footasylum a weaker competitor to JD Sports.</p> <p>But it argued that JD Sports remained the most significant competitor in the eyes of Footasylum customers — greater than either the brands or retail rivals such as Foot Locker and Sports Direct — and that combining the two chains would lead to a substantial lessening of competition.</p> <p>Peter Cowgill, executive chair of JD Sports, said he was “perplexed and disappointed” that the companies' evidence about the growth of direct-to-consumer sales in footwear and the impact of Covid-19 had been rejected.</p> <p>“This transaction will simply not ‘lessen' competition, let alone ‘substantially',” he said.&#xa0; </p> <p>“I am not sure what further evidence the Competition and Markets Authority needs to appreciate the extent of this dynamic change which has been substantially accelerated by Covid-19.”</p> <p>The regulator's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ca05014-acd4-4811-9f0d-d2bdd8ddfd42\">original report</a> was criticised by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which said it failed to adequately <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9d8af68-dbb0-4d37-99e9-51cc3575dc84\">consider the impact of Covid-19</a>, which accelerated the growth of ecommerce and the trend towards brands selling direct to consumers.</p> <p>The CMA also considered what might have happened had Footasylum not been acquired by JD Sports and concluded that it would continue to be supported by brands. </p> <p>Before its takeover, Footasylum had warned on profits three times and the price of its Aim-traded shares had fallen from 164p at the time of its listing in 2017 to below 50p. </p> <p>It is still being run by its own management team, which includes former JD Sports chief executive Barry Bown, after the CMA prevented it from being integrated into JD Sports. </p> <p>Its most recent accounts, for the year to January 2021, show an increase in profits after gross margins recovered. It expects to be able to refinance its revolving credit facility ahead of its expiry in December.</p> <p>With annual sales of roughly £230m and a price tag of £90m, Footasylum is relatively small in the context of recent JD Sports acquisitions, and its share price barely moved on Thursday in response to the CMA news.</p> <p>The company has spent almost £1bn in the past year on DTLR Villa and Shoe Palace in the US and Deporvillage in Spain. In February it raised £1bn in a share placing to fund future deals.</p> <p>Cowgill plans to carry on arguing that he should be permitted to retain his northwestern rival, which was founded by David Makin, one of JD's original backers.</p> <p>“We will continue to make our case strongly to the CMA,” he said.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley  2021 'JD Sports dealt fresh blow over Footasylum deal ' FT.com 2 September.
