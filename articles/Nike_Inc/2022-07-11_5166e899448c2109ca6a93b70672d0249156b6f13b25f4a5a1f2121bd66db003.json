  "title": "Look Out! The Javelin Is Soaring Back at High School Meets; Coaches and former throwers are succeeding in getting the event, long banned in some states, added to track and field programs",
  "text": "<p>The decline is so pronounced that the javelin is one of the lowest-performing events for the U.S. national team, which otherwise has won four times as many Olympic track and field medals as any other nation. U.S. women have won a total of three Olympic medals in javelin, the most recent in 1976, and U.S. men have won five medals, most recently a half-century ago.</p><p>Now, however, there are signs of a resurgence at the local level. This year, at least 22 state high school championship meets included a javelin event, according to a Wall Street Journal tally. That's an increase of five states in the past six years.</p><p>The growth comes as more state high school athletic associations are concluding that it isn't demonstrably more dangerous than some other common athletic pursuits. Javelin proponents say it's an integral part of track and field, and that athletes of all shapes and sizes can excel in the event.</p><p>\"I like the individuality,\" said Elizabeth Sauby, who as a seventh-grader competing for Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., finished 17th in the girls javelin at Florida's Class 2A state high school track and field meet in May. \"I play indoor volleyball, so it's nice to be outdoors as well.\"</p><p>Still, the javelin's resurgence has spurred anxiety even among supporters in a nation that can be hyper-protective of its children.</p><p>\"I'm terrified of it,\" said Simon Ocampo, a teacher and javelin coach at Basha High School in Chandler, Ariz. \"If you think about it, we're one poke away from getting this thing shut down—I mean everywhere.\"</p><p>Arizona introduced the javelin in 2018 after a push from David Shapiro, a former high school athletic director who oversees the state meet for the Arizona Interscholastic Association. \"It's just a graceful event to watch,\" Shapiro said.</p><p>Safety procedures around the event at Arizona's state meet included erecting security fencing to keep people clear of the javelins' flight path and having seven adults work the event, orchestrating throws in a practice area and competition space, he said.</p><p>More than a dozen states have been holding high school javelin competitions for decades, including big states like Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Oregon, a track and field hotbed and the birthplace of Nike Inc., state high school competitions for javelin date back to 1964 for girls and 1927 for boys.</p><p>A freak accident at a 2016 USA Track &amp; Field meet held at a Portland-area high school, however, highlighted the critics' deepest fears.</p><p>A teenage competitor, Parker Kennedy, while following through on a short warm-up throw, essentially hurtled himself into the back end of the javelin, which drove inside his eyelid and into his brain. Kennedy eventually recovered and competed at the University of Washington in sprints, pole vault and decathlon—which includes the javelin.</p><p>Although Kennedy, now 24, acknowledged in an interview that the event has risks, he said high school students should have access to it.</p><p>\"I want people to experience what it's like to throw a spear, because that's an ancient art form, in a sense,\" he said.</p><p>In general, the rate of serious, direct injuries in high school track and field lags that in some other sports, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research. Between 1982 and 2020, that rate was .04 per 100,000 female participants and .08 for male participants. By comparison, male and female hockey players (1.04, 1.09), male football players (1.13) and female cheerleaders (1.58) all had higher injury rates.</p><p>Four catastrophic injuries related to the javelin across all levels of competition have been recorded since 2013 by the catastrophic-injury center. Two high school and two college athletes were impaled by a javelin. Two of the athletes were javelin throwers, one was a discus thrower, and one was a runner. All athletes made full recoveries from their injuries, according to the center.</p><p>During the same period, five catastrophic injuries have been recorded in connection with pole vaulting in high school alone. There were no deaths. No catastrophic injuries were recorded in shot put, discus or hammer throw.</p><p>The Missouri State High School Activities Association added the javelin in 2017 following a trial period, after coaches asked why the state, unlike neighboring Kansas, didn't offer it.</p><p>Josh Hoener, who doubles as district superintendent and throws coach for the small-school classification New Haven (Mo.) High School track and field team in east-central Missouri, said the javelin is one of the most popular events on his team. It's gone off without incident, he said, because everyone from meet officials to athletes is especially careful to pay attention.</p><p>\"It obviously is a show of faith that the kids will be mature enough to handle this event,\" Hoener said.</p><p>Liam Christensen waged a successful campaign to bring the javelin to South Carolina, which added it to the state high school meet in 2021. Christensen had trained at a local track club in the state before winning a scholarship to Stanford that paid about three-fourths of his expenses. He called the javelin \"a massive untapped opportunity for people.\"</p><p>The fifth state to add javelin in recent years was South Dakota, which made it a scoring event at this year's state meet.</p><p>In Florida, various advisory committees tried for years to bring the javelin back to high schools but were always told, \"No, too dangerous,\" said Paul Baur, program director and coach of cross-country and track at Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale. The javelin was contested from 1925 to 1950 at the state high school meet, then discontinued, according to records of the Florida High School Athletic Association.</p><p>The arrival of a more track-friendly association administrator made the difference, Baur said, and javelins began flying again at the 2021 state meet. Florida, like some other states, requires the use of rubber tips on the end of each javelin, which is thought to make them safer.</p><p>\"We're kind of of the mind that if the coaches and schools keep it safe and nobody gets hurt, then they'll probably get to keep the event,\" said Ed Thompson, director of athletics at the FHSAA.</p><p>Elizabeth Sauby of Pine Crest said she was a bit intimidated by the older javelin competitors in her first state meet.</p><p>\"But it was a great learning experience,\" she said. \"And I'll be back next year.\"</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Look Out!
