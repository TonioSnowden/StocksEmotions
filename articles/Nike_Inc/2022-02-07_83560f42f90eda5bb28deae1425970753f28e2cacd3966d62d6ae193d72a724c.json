  "title": "The Silver Wears Prada: Olympic Snowboarder Julia Marino Medals in Style; Ms. Marino scored the first U.S. medal at this weekend's Olympic Games in Beijing in snowboarding slopestyle, wearing prominent Prada gear",
  "text": "<p>\"I did not know Prada made snowboards,\" said the Today Show's Craig Melvin when interviewing Ms. Marinoafter her win. It's a sentiment echoed by many folks on social media, who expressed surprise at seeing the luxury label advertised so prominently on a snowboard. The Italian brand, which is far better known for its luxe handbags and ready-to-wear collections than its sportswear, has nonetheless been making performance gear under the Linea Rossa name since 1997.</p><p>This wasn't Ms. Marino's first foray into Prada. She joined the company as a Linea Rossa spokesperson in March 2021, and starred in the sporty line's fall/winter 2021 campaign alongside British-American freestyle skier and activist Gus Kenworthy.</p><p>Since it rose to prominence in the '90s, and then became an Olympic sport in 1998, snowboarding has been inextricable from its individualistic, relaxed style. But the swaggy, baggy pants, hooded parkas and printed boards are usually the domain of a handful of sports brands including Burton, Arbor and ski stalwart Salomon. While luxury fashion brands such as Dior and Louis Vuitton do design skiwear, it's more the territory of highfalutin' leisure snowbirds in Aspen and Courchevel, and not represented at the Olympics level.</p><p>Ms. Marino's medal in Prada is a coup for the Linea Rossa line, which offers an entire ski and snowboarding collection including gear and clothing. The snowboardstyle used by Ms. Marino is available to buy for $3,600 (For context, all of the snowboards currently available for sale at outdoor retailer REI are under $2,000). Helmets and goggles, like those worn by Ms. Marino, are made in collaboration with California brand Oakley. Linea Rossa also offers clothing, like $320 fluorescent nylon socks and a sleek black $4,300 snowsuit. Ms. Marino wore the official U.S.-team printed Volcom jacket and pants.</p><p>The Prada gear meshed well with the team's Volcom suits, which were both rendered in graphic black and white with a modern feel. But as the only Prada athlete on the team, Ms. Marino had a bit more of a luxurious sheen to her style. And along with her medal, that red logo certainly made her stand out and become a global headline.</p><p>In an email from Beijing, Ms. Marino wrote, \"The community of riders, especially the incredible women I share the slope with, are so tight knit that although the competition aspect is strong, the camaraderie is stronger. But by the same token, riding style and standing out is what keeps this sport developing so quickly. That's one of the reasons why I felt this partnership aligned so well with me, it does a great job at helping me uphold both those values. Wearing and riding Prada equips me to perform, while not overshadowing what snowboarding is all about.\"</p><p>As for the perhaps confounding notion of an American athlete wearing an Italian label, a representative for Ms. Marino stated, \"Jules is Italian-American through and through, so that was a very authentic fit.\"</p><p>For Olympic athletes, personal styleand sponsorships are heavily scrutinized. In 2019, Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter, which outlines marketing rules, was updated. In short, athletes are allowed to represent their personal sponsors but with much regulation. These rules are granular, down to the number of thank-you messages an athlete is allowed to post to their sponsor on social media.</p><p>This regulation is partly in place so that personal sponsors do not interfere with the precious official Olympics sponsors, which are in the hundred-million-dollar range (Prada for example, sponsors Ms. Marino but not the Olympics at large). Moments of indelible individuality—and brand visibility—do prevail at times. For example, sprinter Michael Johnson wore flashy gold-colored Nike shoes to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, which became legendary and later sold at auction by Sotheby's for $31,500.</p><p>Whether Ms. Marino's striking Prada board will endure in the same way that Mr. Johnson's gold shoes did is yet to be seen. But that logo flying through the blue Beijing sky definitely made a strong fashion statement in addition to the silver medal.</p><p>The Silver Wears Prada: Olympic Snowboarder Julia Marino Medals in Style</p>",
