  "title": "Heinz Field no more: Pittsburgh Steelers' home being renamed Acrisure Stadium; Steelers reach a new stadium sponsorship deal that will see the name of the NFL team's home venue change after 20-year pact with the condiment brand expires",
  "text": "<p>That's because the NFL team is reportedly set to change the name on the marquee from Heinz Field to Acrisure Stadium. The stadium's naming-rights deal with Heinz, originally inked with H.J. Heinz, has expired, according to a report in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p><p>See also: Is Netflix cracking down on password sharing?

According to the Post-Gazette report, Acrisure a few years back purchased AI company Tulco LLC, which is run by Thomas Tull, a minority owner of the Steelers.</p><p>\"This is great partnership and will have a tremendous impact on both organizations as well as the greater Pittsburgh community. The Steelers and Acrisure share the same core values of winning and excellence and I could not be prouder to be partnered with both,\" Tull's PR firm Prosek informed MarketWatch.</p><p>See also: Elon Musk tells Trump to 'hang up his hat and sail into the sunset'</p><p>It hasn't yet been reported how much Acrisure will pay for the naming rights, but, according to ProFootballTalk, Heinz paid $57 million in total for the two-decade rights, extended by a year in 2021.</p><p>The new naming-rights deal comes on the heels of several recent naming-rights agreements for sports and entertainment venues in the U.S., many involving brands with financial or crypto roots. The Los Angeles Lakers renamed their stadium the Crypto.com Arena as part of a 20-year, $700 million deal. That has been reported to be the biggest-ever naming-rights deal in global sports history. The Miami Heat's home venue, FTX Arena, is branded under a 19-year deal worth $135 million. And Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, where the Bucks a year ago this month clinched their first NBA title since 1971, is named for that financial technology company FISV under a 2018 rights deal that has been estimated to be worth $6 million a year over a quarter-century span, or $150 million.</p><p>\"While we worked with the Pittsburgh Steelers for several months around a new naming rights deal for Heinz Field, the Steelers found a new partner who was willing to pay significantly more than we could justify,\" Alex Abraham, communications at the Kraft Heinz Company told MarketWatch. \"While the Heinz name will no longer be on the stadium, our partnership with the Steelers will continue in new ways. We're excited to reveal the details of our new Steelers sponsorship in the days ahead.\"</p><p>Representatives of the the Steelers did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's requests for comment on this story.</p><p>See: Open Championship payout: How much did Cameron Smith make?</p><p>Also: When LeBron James chose Nike in 2003, he gave up $28 million â€” it could end up making him $1 billion</p><p>One of the most noteworthy aspects of Heinz Field among fans has been the giant ketchup bottles above the stadium jumbotron. The twin bottles, measuring 35 feet long, 9 feet wide and 6 feet deep and weighing several tons, sit atop the scoreboard and pour out (digital) ketchup whenever the home team gets inside the visitors' 20-yard line, a/k/a into the red zone.</p><p>Those bottles appearing to be coming down according to local reports.</p><p>Heinz Field no more: Pittsburgh Steelers' home being renamed Acrisure Stadium</p>",
