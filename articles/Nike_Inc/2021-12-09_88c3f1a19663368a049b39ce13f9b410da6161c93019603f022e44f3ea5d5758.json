  "title": "What Happened at Travis Scott's Astroworld Concert? What to Know; At least 10 people died when the crowd compressed toward the stage at the Houston event on Nov. 5. Here's the latest information about the tragedy.",
  "text": "<p>In his first interview since the incident, Mr. Scott said that he wasn't fully aware of what had happened until after the show. \"I didn't know the exact details until minutes before the press conference,\" the rap superstar told radio and talk-show host Charlamagne Tha God in an interview posted on YouTube on Dec. 9.</p><p>\"It really hurt,\" Mr. Scott said of the tragedy. \"It hurts the community, it hurts a city.\"</p><p>Mr. Scott said he didn't hear people's screams for help. \"Anytime you can hear something like that you want to stop the show,\" he said in the interview. \"I just didn't hear that.\"</p><p>He said that the Astroworld concert felt like a regular show to him and that \"people didn't show up there to just be harmful.\" The musician has previously encouraged raucous behavior at his events.</p><p>Mr. Scott said in the interview that as an artist, he handles the creative aspects of his performances and controls what he can onstage, while \"professionals control what they can in the crowd.\"</p><p>\"Fans…come to the show [to] have a good experience, and I have a responsibility to figure out what happened here,\" he said. \"I have a responsibility to figure out the solution…Hopefully this takes a first step into us as artists having that more insight of what's going on.\"</p><p>What happened at the Astroworld event?</p><p>The crowd surge occurred around 9:38 p.m., according to Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Peña.</p><p>\"The crowd began to compress towards the front of the stage, and that caused some panic, and it started causing some injuries,\" Chief Peña said. \"People began to fall out, become unconscious, and it created additional panic.\"</p><p>More than 300 people were treated at a field hospital at the festival, he said.</p><p>What do we know about the people hurt or killed at the event?</p><p>Attendees described a crowd surge with 50,000 people that led some to fall unconscious. A 9-year-old boy died on Nov. 14 of injuries suffered during the concert, the family's attorney said, marking the 10th fatality stemming from the show. The boy, Ezra Blount, became the youngest person to die of injuries from the crowd surge.</p><p>Others who died at the concert ranged in age from 14 to 27. At least one person remains in critical condition. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said on Nov. 10 that an investigation would take weeks or months. The causes of death for the deceased haven't been determined.</p><p>Who is Travis Scott?</p><p>Mr. Scott, a Houston native and protégé of Kanye West, is among the most popular artists of the past decade. Known for his singsong, Auto-Tune-heavy vocal style, he helped popularize the now common practice of singing while rapping. His 2018 album \"Astroworld\" has sold more than four million copies in the U.S.</p><p>Mr. Scott, who has a history of encouraging raucous behavior at his concerts, said in a post on Twitter after the Nov. 5 show that he was \"absolutely devastated.\"</p><p>CNN cited Travis Scott's girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, whose Instagram Story on Nov. 7 featured the following post: \"Travis and I are broken and devastated. My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives, were injured or affected in any way by yesterday's events. And also for Travis who I know cares deeply for his fans and the Houston community. I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing. I am sending my deepest condolences to all the families during this difficult time and will be praying for the healing of everyone who has been impacted.\"</p><p>Were there warning signs?</p><p>Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said he had met with Mr. Scott and his head of security before the concert to voice safety concerns. The police chief said social tensions and Covid-19 made it a particularly challenging time. He said he had asked Mr. Scott's team to work with police and to watch their social-media messaging.</p><p>Questions raised by the tragedy include whether the event should have been designed differently to address risks associated with a packed crowd, and whether security staff members were prepared. Executives and security officials are also debating whether Mr. Scott and his team should have moved faster to end the show.</p><p>Videos posted to social media show a chaotic scene in the packed venue. Some concertgoers can be heard yelling for help as the music continues. At least two people approached a camera operator and attempted to stop the concert, the videos show. Other videos show what appear to be unconscious concertgoers on the ground, with other attendees attempting to resuscitate them.</p><p>The concert business is grappling with a shortage of seasoned workers, which touring professionals fear could lead to safety problems.</p><p>What is the status of the related investigations?</p><p>Houston police have launched a criminal probe. They are assessing the possibility of overdoses caused by counterfeit pills that might have been laced with fentanyl, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Investigators are also looking at whether some people were killed when the crowd surged toward the stage, the person said.</p><p>A spokesman for the Houston Police Department declined to comment on the drug investigation.</p><p>Police Chief Finner said that many theories had been put forward about the incident, including that someone had injected a security officer with drugs. On Nov. 10, Chief Finner said that report was false; the security guard said he had been struck on the head, not injected.</p><p>What did Mr. Scott know about what was happening in the crowd?</p><p>Mr. Scott's lawyers said he couldn't see or hear what was happening in the crowd, and the rapper said in his interview with Charlamagne Tha God that he hadn't heard people screaming. His lawyers have said Mr. Scott didn't know the severity of the situation and found out only after the show.</p><p>What did Mr. Scott do after the concert?</p><p>Mr. Scott attended an afterparty at Dave &amp; Buster's, a national chain restaurant with arcade games, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Scott didn't know the severity of the situation when he arrived at the party, the person said, adding that no one—including the police—had publicly confirmed the night's disastrous events. When someone at the party informed Mr. Scott what had happened, he left immediately, the person said.</p><p>Will Mr. Scott face lawsuits?</p><p>Yes, the musician and others who were involved in organizing the show have been named in several lawsuits.</p><p>Mr. Scott has developed a reputation for encouraging aggressive fan behavior. During a 2017 show at New York City's Terminal 5 venue in Manhattan, he egged on fans to climb down from a balcony to the ground floor. One fan said he was pushed and fell, and he sued Mr. Scott, who has said that he wasn't responsible. Todd Mensing, one of Mr. Scott's lawyers, says the criticism is based on \"a tremendous amount of misinformation.\"</p><p>According to Mr. Scott's lawyers, he paused the Houston show on multiple occasions when he thought someone in the crowd was in distress, moves they say pointed out the issues to security. He checked on the crowd before continuing, his lawyers said. Several video clips shared on social media show the music being paused, including one instance when Mr. Scott flagged someone in trouble. \"Somebody [is] passed out right here,\" he can be heard saying.</p><p>How is the event being discussed on social media?</p><p>There are concerns about how footage and misinformation related to the event are circulating online. Videos showing people being crushed and unconscious have been shared widely on TikTok, Twitter and other platforms. \"Travis Scott concert\" was one of the most searched terms on Google on Nov. 6, the day after the incident, according to Google Trends data.</p><p>On TikTok, videos using the hashtag #Astroworld had about 2.4 billion views as of Nov. 11. More than 400,000 tweets have mentioned either Mr. Scott or the festival by name since the event, according to an analysis by Storyful, a social-media research firm owned by Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.</p><p>Conspiracy theories, including one claiming the concert was part of a satanic ritual, have also become prevalent. Tweets mentioning satanism more than tripled from Nov. 7 through Nov. 9 compared with the prior three-day period, according to the Storyful analysis.</p><p>How has the incident affected Travis Scott's business?</p><p>Nike Inc. halted the rollout of its sneaker collaboration with Mr. Scott. \"Out of respect for everyone impacted by the tragic events at the Astroworld Festival, we are postponing the launch of the Air Max 1 x Cactus Jack,\" Nike said on its website.</p><p>Write to Anthony DeRosa at anthony.derosa@wsj.com and Neil Shah at Neil.Shah@wsj.com</p><p>What Happened at Travis Scott's Astroworld Concert?
