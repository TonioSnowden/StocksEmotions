  "title": "Nike Posts Flat Sales, Jump in Inventories; Declining revenues in North America and China offset gains in Europe",
  "text": "<p>Revenue in the North American market, which accounts for the majority of total sales, declined 5% to $5.1 billion. Sales in China declined 19% to $1.56 billion, mostly because of Covid-19 restrictions in the country. Sales jumped in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia, compared with a year ago.</p><p>Some retailers have reported having excess inventory and having to sell products at a discount. Nike, however, has said in recent quarters that demand was outpacing supply and it was facing elevated freight costs and longer transit times. Conditions were already improving during the quarter ended Feb. 28, executives previously said.</p><p>The company reported a 23% increase in inventory in the May quarter, compared with the prior year.</p><p>Investors are interested in the company's outlook for the coming fiscal year, which they hope won't be disrupted as it was this year by factory closures in Vietnam or lockdown restrictions in China, analysts said.</p><p>\"We don't think the China outlook will be as bad as feared,\" UBS research analyst Jay Sole said. He said the company was also about to move onto the next phase of its direct-to-consumer strategy, reducing the amount of wholesale customers it deals with, and it won't face the same headwinds it did in the previous years.</p><p>In the May quarter, Nike's direct-to-consumer sales increased 7% to $4.8 billion.</p><p>Last week, Nike said it plans to leave Russia, citing operational difficulties due to its invasion of Ukraine. Executives previously said business in both countries, which had been paused since March, represented less than 1% of Nike's total revenue.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Nike Posts Flat Sales, Jump in Inventories</p>",
