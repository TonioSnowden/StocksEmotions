Of those three, only the tech sector has had forward P/E valuations contract more than the weighted price has dropped. (The forward P/E valuations are based on rolling 12-month earnings-per-share estimates.)</p><p>* The energy sector is the only one that is up so far in 2022. But the rise in oil prices has driven such a high increase in earnings estimates that the sector's forward price-to-earnings valuation has declined 21%.</p><p>If you are convinced that a particular sector or group of sectors is likely to perform well, one easy way to ride along is with an exchange traded fund designed to mirror its performance.</p><p>The SPDR series of ETFs, managed by State Street Global Advisors, are popular and designed to track the performance of each of the 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500. They include:</p><p>* Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY — $14.6 billion in assets under management.</p><p>* Communication Services Select SPDR Fund XLC — $9.4 billion.</p><p>* Technology Select SPDR Fund XLK — $38.6 billion.</p><p>* Energy Select SPDR Fund XLE — $33.6 billion.</p><p>This isn't to say that the SPDR sector funds are your only choice. Vanguard and iShares, for example, offer sector funds using different methodologies to track segments of broader indexes.</p><p>Analysts' top stock picks</p><p>Here are analysts favorite stocks within the consumer discretionary, communications services and technology sectors, based on percentages of \"buy\" or equivalent ratings, followed by the energy sector, which has been added because of its decline in P/E valuation even as it has risen 37% this year.</p><p>Consumer discretionary</p><p>Here are analysts' 10 favorite consumer discretionary stocks in the S&amp;P 500, sorted by share of \"buy\" or equivalent ratings: </p><p> Company                      Ticker   Share \"buy\" ratings   Closing price – June 28   Consensus price target   Implied 12-month upside potential  Caesars Entertainment Inc.
