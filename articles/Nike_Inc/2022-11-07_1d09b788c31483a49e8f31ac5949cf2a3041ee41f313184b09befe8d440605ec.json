  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  What's Your Workout?  At 49, She Just Finished  The New York Marathon  Faster Than at Age 35  ----  By Jen Murphy",
  "text": "<p>\n   Erica Stanley-Dottin is proof that we can speed up as we age. </p><p>\n  At 48, she crossed the finish line of the Berlin Marathon in September in a time of 2 hours, 52 minutes and 5 seconds. That made her one of a handful of U.S.-born African-American women to run 26.2 miles in under three hours, as tracked by the National Black Marathoners Association. </p><p>\n  Now 49, she had hoped to clock a 2-hour, 48-minute race at the New York City Marathon on Sunday. She ended up finishing in a time of 3 hours and 7 minutes. </p><p>\n  When Ms. Stanley-Dottin ran her first marathon in 2008 at age 35, she just wanted to break four hours. </p><p>\n  \"For years I watched the New York City Marathon pass by my home in Brooklyn and I'd cheer on friends or even join their training runs,\" she says. \"I got inspired to finally run for myself.\" </p><p>\n  She didn't hit her goal, but the former Georgetown University sprinter discovered she hadn't lost her competitive edge. \"As soon as I finished, I wanted to try again and get faster,\" she says. </p><p>\n  She took her training to the next level in 2018 when she joined Black Roses, a New York City running club. </p><p>\n  Running with younger and faster athletes has helped her speed up. She does acknowledge that more aches come with age, especially after sprints. \"My fast-twitch muscles have gotten rusty,\" she says. For years she could get away with a running-only approach to training. Now she incorporates strength and prehab-type exercises to avoid injuries. </p><p>\n  A former freelance event producer, Ms. Stanley-Dottin joined running-apparel company Tracksmith in April as its New York City community manager. The weeks ahead of the New York City Marathon are her busiest -- she organized events and workouts for local communities. Moving away from freelancing affected her training. </p><p>\n  \"I've been waking up for 6 a.m. runs, and every day is a puzzle to fit in a workout,\" says Ms. Stanley-Dottin, a mother of sons ages 9 and 11. </p><p>\n  This will mark her first year running three marathons, and she says her body is holding up. She completed the Boston Marathon in April in a time of 3:01:56. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Workout </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Ms. Stanley-Dottin joins three workouts a week with her running club. During peak marathon training, she might average 75 miles a week. That might include track workouts -- such as a speed workout of 600-, 400-, 300- and 200-meter intervals -- a tempo run and one long weekend run. The two weeks leading up to a marathon she scales back mileage, but not intensity. </p><p>\n  She always warms up with calf and hamstring stretches and exercises that activate her glutes and hip flexors. Post-workout, Ms. Stanley-Dottin uses a trigger-point foam roller as part of her cool-down. If she's feeling sore, she puts on compression leg sleeves to increase circulation and help with recovery. </p><p>\n  Twice a week, she attends a 50-minute Pilates reformer class. The class strengthens her key running muscles: glutes, abs, hips and hamstrings. She says it has made a major difference in her training. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   The Diet </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Philosophy: Ms. Stanley-Dottin has dabbled with vegan and vegetarian diets but says her body craves meat protein during training. She is a pescatarian. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Breakfast: Coffee and protein smoothies. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Lunch and dinner: She eats a lot of salads topped with garbanzo beans, brown rice and fish. She makes lunch her main meal and has a light dinner when she gets home from workouts between 8:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Snacks: KIND bars, overnight oats, avocados and spoonfuls of nut butter straight from the jar. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Splurge: \"Indian food is my naughty food,\" she says. \"I order it a few times the week after a marathon and get samosas and tikka masala with all of the rice and bread.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Essential Gear </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Apparel: Ms. Stanley-Dottin says she wore Tracksmith apparel before she joined the company. She's a fan of the brand's Allston tights ($160), Session short tights ($90), Brighton Base layer ($100) and Speed Crew socks ($30). </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Sneakers: Tracksmith Eliot Runner for training ($200), Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 for harder training efforts ($275) and Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next% 2 ($275) for race day. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Watch: Garmin Fenix 6S Pro Solar edition ($800) </p><p></p>",
