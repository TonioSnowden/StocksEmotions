  "title": "Adidas Takes Hit From Boycott in China, Once Seen as a Growth Engine; The sportswear company, along with other Western apparel brands, continues to suffer from a Chinese consumer boycott",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, the company reported that its revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong fell 15% in the third quarter after dropping by 16% in the second. Adidas was hit by a consumer boycott that began earlier this year after the company, as part of a consortium of Western brands, raised concerns about forced-labor allegations in China's Xinjiang region.</p><p>Adidas shares were down around 6% in mid-day trade in Germany.</p><p>Adidas's China problem highlights a dilemma facing Western companies in the country, as Beijing toughens rules for businesses and geopolitical tensions rise. Businesses are grappling with how to stand firm on human-rights issues, something that consumers in the West demand, while continuing to profit from the world's second-largest economy.</p><p>\"It's kind of a lose-lose situation,\" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at German fund manager Deka Investment, which holds 0.8% of Adidas. \"The options are limited.\"</p><p>China remains one of its strategic growth markets, Adidas said Wednesday. The company is working on an action plan to mitigate the current downturn, it said, including brand campaigns, developing products for the local market, and expanding its stores network.</p><p>Addressing the consumer boycott, Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told reporters that \"the key will be to show consumers our appreciation and respect, to earn their loyalty and complement our global brand strength with a strong local angle and understanding.\"</p><p>\"There are good reasons to remain excited about the opportunity in China as outlined in our strategy, but it's clearly also still quite some work ahead of us,\" he said.</p><p>Apparel companies such as Nike Inc., H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB and Puma SE have also felt the heat. Puma's CEO, Bjørn Gulden, said last month that the company still couldn't use Chinese influencers to burnish its brand, and shopper traffic in stores was down as it reported a 16% fall in Greater China revenues for the third quarter. The challenge is coming just as new, more competitive homegrown Chinese brands are emerging.</p><p>\"We have to accept that China will be more difficult than we had hoped for as we started the year,\" Mr. Gulden said. \"I think we are in a politically tense situation that we need to work through.\"</p><p>Besides the consumer boycott, supply-chain disruptions and factory closures have also affected sportswear demand in China. Adidas on Wednesday pared its full-year outlook, saying it now expects its top and bottom lines to be at the lower end of its previous guidance.</p><p>More on Businesses in China</p><p>* China Disappeared H&amp;M From Its Internet, Splitting Fashion Industry Group (May 22)</p><p>* China's Power Shortfalls Begin to Ripple Around the World (Oct. 21)</p><p>* Foreign Businesses Say They Feel Effects From China's Turn Inward (Sept. 24)</p><p>* H&amp;M Criticized in China Over Xinjiang Forced-Labor Stance (March 24)</p><p>* U.S. Says China Is Committing Genocide Against Uighur Muslims (Jan. 19)</p><p>The company is more exposed than its competitors, analysts say. Mainland China accounts for close to a quarter of its revenues, compared with 17% for Nike and 5.2% for H&amp;M, according to FactSet. Adidas's share price has lagged behind both Nike and Puma in recent months.</p><p>\"The China dependency is an issue for Adidas,\" Mr. Speich said. \"For Nike, the U.S. market is far more important. For Adidas, the European market is too small. They have to look to China for growth.\"</p><p>To be sure, outside of China, Adidas and other sportswear companies are benefiting from factors such as a pandemic-induced boom of athletic wear. On Wednesday, Adidas said its revenues in North America, Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa grew strongly last quarter.</p><p>But China is now the largest apparel and footwear market in the world valued at $376 billion in 2021, followed by the U.S. at $330 billion, according to market researcher Euromonitor International.</p><p>There is a strong runway for further growth as China's sportswear consumption per capita is lower compared with other consumer goods such as electronics and luxury goods, Bank of America analysts wrote in a recent report to clients. In August, the Chinese government rolled out a five-year mass fitness program to expand sports parks, fitness centers and stadiums, in a move expected to boost the sportswear industry.</p><p>Adidas faces other challenges besides the consumer boycott in China. Local sportswear makers such as Anta Sports Products Ltd. and Li Ning Co. Ltd. have improved in quality and design in recent years, analysts say. Anta increased its market share to 15.4% last year from 10.4% in 2016, while Adidas grew 1 percentage point in the same period, to 17.4%, according to Euromonitor.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Adidas and Nike have attempted to make environmental sustainability central to marketing their brand. Both are longtime members of the Better Cotton Initiative, a coalition of fashion brands, nonprofit groups and other organizations that licenses sustainably and ethically sourced cotton. In early March, Adidas joined the Better Cotton Initiative's board.</p><p>Just weeks later, nationalistic Chinese media outlets and social-media users suddenly attacked the Better Cotton Initiative for raising concerns about forced-labor allegations in the Xinjiang region, where the U.S. and other governments say Beijing is committing genocide against Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities. Beijing has vociferously denied the accusations.</p><p>The media outlets and social-media users called for a boycott against BCI brands. H&amp;M, another board member of the group, was suddenly erased from e-commerce sites and map apps. Influencers dropped endorsements of BCI brands.</p><p>\"You had a brutal stop in traffic\" following the BCI boycott, Puma's Mr. Gulden said last month.</p><p>There are signs that the nationalistic anger hasn't subsided. In October, Chinese social-media users attacked a Chinese basketball star, Hu Mingxuan, for endorsing Adidas. Critical posts about Mr. Hu and Adidas on Chinese social-media service Weibo garnered about 32 million views and 22,000 comments.</p><p>Adidas's sales on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Tmall, one of China's largest e-commerce platforms, were down 49% in October from a year ago, according to Bank of America. That was the worst monthly performance since May, when they were down 70% at the peak of the boycott.</p><p>The coming Winter Olympic Games—normally a time for sportswear brands to launch big marketing campaigns—pose another challenge for Adidas. The company sponsors the German Olympic team, a Winter Games powerhouse, as well as the British team.</p><p>But now, the Games, being held in Beijing, carry a reputational risk. Some NGOs and consumer groups are calling for a boycott of the event over human-rights issues. A Euromonitor survey in April showed that over 31% of surveyed global consumers prefer to buy from brands that support social and political issues aligned with their values.</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com</p><p>Adidas Takes Hit From Boycott in China, Once Seen as a Growth Engine</p>",
