  "text": "<p>Tate &amp; Lyle confirmed break-up plans with the ingredients maker in talks to sell a controlling stake in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cd54fa9-7009-4df7-b882-4bbb966767fd\">sweeteners business</a>.</p> <p>Talks with a&#xa0;new long-term financial partner over the division, known as Primary Products, were at an early stage with no certainty of completion, the company said. The break-up plan was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/24/tate-lyle-bids-break/\">Sunday Telegraph</a>, which named private equity funds Apollo Global Management and Cerberus&#xa0;as potential partners.</p> <p>“If a transaction of this nature was completed it would enable Tate &amp; Lyle and the new business to focus their respective strategies and capital allocation priorities and create the opportunity for enhanced shareholder value,” it said in a statement. </p> <p>Analysts put a total value on Primary Products of between £1.8bn and £3bn based on its annual underlying earnings of around £230m. </p> <p>“This clearly supports our view that Tate has ambitions to reshape its portfolio towards speciality ingredients, which are faster growing and have higher margins and returns on capital,” said Investec analyst Alicia Forry. “With a current enterprise value of £3.8bn for Tate &amp; Lyle, we believe the sale of Primary Products would reveal to the market just how low the valuations of the Food and Beverage Solutions and Sucralose [artificial sweetener] businesses really are.”</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> said first-quarter revenue grew 5 per cent, with online learning the star performing division. Andy Bird, the textbook publisher's new chief executive, left full-year guidance unchanged after reporting an “encouraging start to the year despite challenging market conditions”. </p> <p>Engineer <strong>IMI</strong> raised full-year guidance and launched a £200m share buyback. Group sales, profits and operating cash flow were all higher organically in the first quarter than the same period in the prior year, with margins improving “significantly”, the company said. First-quarter organic revenue growth of 7.7 per cent and accelerated benefits of restructuring meant IMI was able to target full-year adjusted earnings per share of between 81p and 87p, from 75p and 82p previously.</p> <p>Oil explorer <strong>EnQuest</strong>&#xa0;agreed to buy the Bentley heavy-oil discovery, one of the North Sea's largest undeveloped oilfields, from current operator Whalsay Energy. EnQuest said it will put in initial funding of $2m to take 100 per cent control of Bentley, which is close to its existing Kraken and Bressay fields. Up to a further $40m is due from Whalsay based on future revenues.</p> <p><strong>Staffline</strong>,&#xa0;the recruitment and training group, said a better than expected first-quarter provides increased confidence in the full year. Underlying operating profit more than doubled in the period to £1.4m on stable revenues of £227.9m, it reported. </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Superdry</strong> named as its new chair Peter Sjölander, formerly a Nike&#xa0;executive and chief executive of Scandinavian&#xa0;fashion label of Helly Hansen. Sjölander replaces Peter Williams, who resigned last year having joined Superdry in April 2019 to aid a turnround under the retailer's returning founder Julian Dunkerton.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Some of <strong>Credit Suisse's</strong> largest shareholders will attempt to remove the board member <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93e6ef82-7280-496e-8af5-ba84a24a639d\">in charge of risk oversight</a>, in protest at twin scandals that have cost the bank and its clients billions and tarnished its reputation. David Herro, vice-chair of Harris Associates, which says it owns 10.25 per cent of the stock, said he hoped the arrival of a new chair — former Lloyds Bank chief executive António Horta-Osório — on April 30 would lead to an overhaul of the board with more banking expertise recruited. Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Ethos, which represents 200 Swiss pension funds that own between 3 and 5 per cent of the lender, said his clients were “really angry”.</p> <p><strong>ExxonMobil</strong> faces an “existential business risk” by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab010de-43c8-4b60-80f2-020f01610eee\">pinning its future on fossil fuels</a> as governments move to slash emissions, activist hedge fund Engine No 1 will tell investors in an 80-page investor presentation seen by the Financial Times. The energy company “touts its efforts in areas like carbon capture and biofuels”, the document said, but those efforts have “delivered more advertising than results”. The effort to overhaul Exxon's board is among the most-watched US shareholder proxy battles in years.<br><br>The austere and graceful drama Nomadland was the biggest winner at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/658a77b1-578f-44ec-9b26-a6d5dea79c93\">93rd Academy Awards on Sunday</a>, capturing Best Picture, Best Director for Chloé Zhao and Best Actress for Frances McDormand. The victories capped an Oscars ceremony modified for the Covid-19 pandemic, with the ceremony held in front of a pared-down live audience after a year in which the film industry was devastated by cinema closures and delayed movie releases.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Andrew Hill <br></strong>The symbolism of the&#xa0;abolition of the executive floor&#xa0;at HSBC, once one of the most tradition-bound corporate institutions on the planet, should not be underestimated. But leaders will have to do more than shuffle their desks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c3751fd-34d4-4952-815e-08f007e5fbd0\">grasp the opportunity</a> presented by post-pandemic working.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>Recent disquiet about the Takeover Panel rules suggest there is room for improvement but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8069c138-8f0a-4c63-b197-772122c0b71c\">an unconvincing case</a> for a wholesale rewrite. </p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
