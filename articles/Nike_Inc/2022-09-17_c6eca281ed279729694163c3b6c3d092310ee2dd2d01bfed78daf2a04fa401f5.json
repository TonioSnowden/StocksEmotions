  "title": "Is a Bra a Shirt? These Women Say Yes; The bra designed to be worn as a top is a pandemic-fueled hit that showed on many runways (and front rows) at New York Fashion Week",
  "text": "<p>The piece has indeed become foundational like a T-shirt for some; celebrities such as Zoë Kravitz, Kaia Gerber, Gwyneth Paltrow and Florence Pugh, as well as regular women like a particularly with-it Brooklyn barista I met this year, are using bra tops as building blocks in their wardrobe for both day and night. (A subtlety: These are garments designed specifically as bra tops, made to be exposed and with more structure and substance than lingerie or your typical flimsy nude triangle bra.) They're worn under blazers, under button-ups, and sometimes, daringly, with no other cover at all.</p><p>These past few days at New York Fashion Week, designers continued to stoke the flames of this scorching style, with show after show (and front row after front row) featuring at least one woman in a bra top. Downtown brand Sandy Liang showed a series of '90s Prada-evoking looks featuring tailored bras and straight skirts. Michael Kors, not one to jump on fleeting trends, offered a few including a dressed-up one paired with slacks in lime green. Tom Ford, a master of bringing sexy back since his days designing for Gucci, closed out the week of shows with enough bra tops to keep Julia Fox outfitted for at least a week.</p><p>Speaking of Julia Fox, the actor and provocateur is to the bra top what Mark Zuckerberg is to the hoodie: its ambassador. Since she became something of a paparazzi star earlier this year after attending the couture shows in Paris with brief paramour Kanye West, she's very rarely been seen in a shirt. Her bra tops have taken the form of a bandeau, strings and even, this September, what appeared to be a strip of duct tape.</p><p>While Ms. Fox is taking bra tops to the extreme, they'd earlier crept onto the paparazzi circuit in August 2019, when Katie Holmes wore a cashmere bra top by the New York brand Khaite out shopping in New York. In taupe cashmere with a matching cardigan, and only fractionally visible, it was as demure as a bra top can be. But it still made headlines, since at the time a bra, even a top-like bra, was unusual. Ms. Holmes later wryly told Laura Brown at InStyle magazine, \"I have been in this business for quite some time. We both know you have ups and downs. It's been a really exciting time because of the cashmere bra.\"</p><p>Variations on Ms. Holmes's bra continue to be big sellers for Khaite. Jodi Kahn, vice president of luxury fashion at Neiman Marcus, attributed the trend's continued success to that Khaite bra, saying that it's now a \"go-to for many designers.\" She pointed to some more grown-up ways of wearing it, such as in tailored, sequined form from Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli. Ms. Kahn also noted that at Neiman Marcus, the bra top sees the most success when it's sold as a matching set with a skirt or trousers.</p><p>Bra tops do have the capacity to bring the party. Maryam Nassir Zadeh, the founder and creative director of her eponymous New York brand, wore a purple sequined Moschino swim top to her 44th birthday party this year. Over the years, she's collected vintage bra tops from Prada, Miu Miu and Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p><p>She's also made them a standard feature of her avant-garde ready-to-wear collections, even in wool and suede. At her show this past week on Manhattan's Lower East Side, bra tops were layered under and over tops in various states of transparency, and on their own. Ms. Zadeh said they sell well among her experimental and playful customers. \"People are celebrating things that are beautiful outside the norm. That goes hand in hand with people sharing private body parts and embracing it,\" she said. \"It's not a big deal to show a little bit of boob or a little bit of nipple.\"</p><p>For those of us who are not quite there yet, Los Angeles stylist Kat Gosik said that a $30 Nike bra top or sports bra with a cardigan over it is a good trial for beginners. For the more advanced, look to one of her clients, Christine Quinn of the Netflix reality show \"Selling Sunset,\" who wore a Jacquemus bra top, miniskirt and piles of diamond jewelry during the couture shows in Paris this summer.</p><p>Ms. Gosik said she'd noticed a lot of bra tops at the Coachella music festival this year, including a $3,390 crystal-encrusted Saint Laurent example that has been worn by Ms. Kravitz. Even as they're now widespread, she said they still have the power to shock. \"I think it definitely can raise eyebrows,\" she said, \"but I don't necessarily think that's negative.\"</p><p>Write to Rory Satran at rory.satran@wsj.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are bra tops a fashion faux pas?
