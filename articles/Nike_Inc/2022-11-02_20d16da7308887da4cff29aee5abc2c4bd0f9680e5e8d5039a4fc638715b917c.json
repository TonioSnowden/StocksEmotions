  "title": "Dan Snyder Hires BofA to Explore Potential Sale of the Washington Commanders; The embattled Washington owner has faced criticism and investigations in recent years over the team's workplace culture and other issues and has taken a step that can be a prelude to selling the team.",
  "text": "<p>Although the statement did not specifically say they plan to sell the team, hiring a major bank is often a prelude to such a move. A sale would mark a jarring reversal for Dan Snyder, who has repeatedly rebuffed any notion of selling, even as problems mounted for both him and his team.</p><p>Snyder and his team have been the subject of escalating off-the-field controversies in recent years. An NFL-led probe into the team that concluded last year—which arose after former employees reported being sexually or verbally harassed while working there—found that the team's workplace culture was unprofessional, especially for women. Snyder has denied wrongdoing in regards to allegations specifically against him, including a settlement he paid to a woman. A powerful Congressional committee has since been investigating Snyder, the team and the NFL's handling of the team's issues.</p><p>Public scrutiny of sports team owners, their behavior and whether they should be allowed to maintain their prestigious perches in the face of ugly allegations has been particularly acute lately. In September, Phoenix Suns and Mercury owner Robert Sarver said that he would begin the process of selling the basketball teams after an investigation into his workplace conduct led the league to suspend him for a year and fine him $10 million. The probe found that Sarver had uttered racial slurs \"when recounting the statements of others,\" made sex-related comments in the workplace and treated female employees unequally.</p><p>Relenting to the pressure, however, has a big benefit for owners who are under scrutiny: their teams are worth enormous sums of money. A sale of the Commanders would be expected to top the $4.65 billion the Denver Broncos went for earlier this year.</p><p>Snyder's decision to seek an exit was hailed by the attorneys representing dozens of his former employees.</p><p>\"Today's news that Dan and Tanya Snyder are exploring selling the Washington Commanders is a good development for the team, its former and current employees, and its many fans,\" said lawyers Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who have long criticized Snyder and the NFL for allowing him to continue owning the club. \"We will have to see how this unfolds, but this could obviously be a big step towards healing and closure for the many brave women and men who came forward.\"</p><p>The Commanders' announcement comes shortly after another NFL owner, the Indianapolis Colts' Jim Irsay, called for the league to act against Snyder. \"I believe there's merit to remove him as owner of the [team],\" Irsay said at league meetings last month.</p><p>In response to Irsay's comments, a Commanders spokesperson said that, when Irsay has seen the evidence, he would conclude that \"​​there is no reason for the Snyders to consider selling the franchise. And they won't.\"</p><p>But Snyder has privately faced increasing pressure to sell the team from other owners, a person familiar with the matter said, while sponsors have also expressed concerns about him to other owners.</p><p>Forbes first reported that Snyder had hired BofA Securities to explore a potential sale of the franchise.</p><p>If Snyder proceeds with a sale, it could set the stage for a record-breaking auction. The Broncos sale earlier this year shattered the price for a North American sports team. People inside the sport have long expected that if the Commanders hit the market, the price tag would exceed that given the franchise's rich history and its location.</p><p>Snyder first purchased the team formerly known as the Redskins in 1999, taking over a club that won three Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s and had developed one of the game's most rabid fanbases. But the team has struggled both on- and off-the-field since he took over. It has routinely missed the playoffs and hasn't reached a Super Bowl—while being the subject of numerous controversies.</p><p>For years, activists called on Snyder to change its longtime name, dubbing it a racial epithet and insensitive toward Native Americans. Snyder steadfastly refused to do so.</p><p>That finally changed in 2020, as protests against racial injustice swept across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd. That amplified the longstanding criticisms of the team, and even the team's biggest sponsors joined the chorus. FedEx called for a change and Nike removed the team's gear from its website. That renewed pressure led to Snyder changing course and dropping the moniker it had used for 87 years. After two seasons playing as the Washington Football Team, it adopted the Commanders name earlier this year.</p><p>That was just one of the several problems playing out for Snyder and the team simultaneously. Snyder was also fighting with the team's minority owners in a feud that grew increasingly nasty. The limited partners took him to arbitration, saying he had violated their shareholder agreement. Lawyers for Snyder, meanwhile, accused them of trying to force him to sell the team and orchestrating a smear campaign against him when he refused. It was settled when he eventually bought them out.</p><p>The allegations against the team's workplace culture remain at least partly unresolved, however. The team was fined $10 million, and Snyder agreed to step away from the day-to-day operations of the team following an investigation that he initially commissioned, but which was later taken over by the league.</p><p>Then came the House Committtee on Oversight and Reform's probe, which introduced new allegations of financial improprieties inside the team and another woman who at a committee-hosted roundtable accused Snyder of sexually harassing her. Snyder denied the allegation, but it led to yet another NFL investigation of Snyder and the team. That probe, led by former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo White, is ongoing.</p><p>Snyder testified to Congress in late July, after a lengthy back-and-forth with the committee. The House oversight report is expected before the committee's chairwoman, New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney, leaves Congress in early January.</p><p>This litany of issues also produced yet another problem: finding a new home for the team that plays in an increasingly substandard facility, FedEx Field. Prospects for a new stadium for the team have stalled amid political obstacles—including objections to Snyder specifically—in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia.</p><p>Should Snyder ultimately proceed with a sale, it would save the NFL and its owners from weighing the potentially acrimonious process of forcing him to sell. League bylaws require 24 of 32 teams to vote an owner out.</p><p>A sale would almost certainly be a welcome notion for the club's fans, who have watched the team suffer over the last couple decades. Earlier this year, at a game, they chanted: \"Sell the team.\"</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com</p><p>Dan Snyder Hires BofA to Explore Potential Sale of the Washington Commanders</p>",
