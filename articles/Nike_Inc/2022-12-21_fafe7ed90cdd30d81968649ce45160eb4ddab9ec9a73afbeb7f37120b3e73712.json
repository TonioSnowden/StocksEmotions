  "title": "Stocks Rally, Bolstered by Consumer Data; Dow rises more than 500 points after consumer confidence data extends broad-based gains",
  "text": "<p>Early gains accelerated after consumer confidence data jumped sharply in December to its highest level since April. Sentiment around the economy and labor market improved, while inflation expectations for the year ahead dipped to 6.7%—the lowest in more than a year.</p><p>Housing market data painted a mixed picture. Existing-home sales fell for a 10th straight month in November to extend the longest streak of declines on record. However, home prices—which weighed on activity by soaring to record highs earlier this year—dropped for the fifth straight month.</p><p>Some analysts said the combination of a more confident consumer and falling prices—as well as price expectations—is likely welcome news for Federal Reserve officials, who are working on controlling inflation without causing a major recession.</p><p>Wednesday's climb marked a recovery after recent declines were fueled by the prospect of ongoing rate increases creating an economic downturn. The Bank of Japan's change to its yield curve control policy had also driven concerns about tighter financial conditions globally.</p><p>The path of inflation and Fed policy remains a key concern for investors, after rising rates hit markets hard in 2022, sparking steep declines in both stocks and bonds.</p><p>Recent signs that price pressures are waning have helped allow the central bank to slow the pace of rate increases, said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. The dilemma for Fed officials: if they pause tightening, financial conditions could loosen enough for high inflation to return.</p><p>\"The number one question is at what point can we stop worrying about inflation,\" said Mr. Ripley. \"The Fed doesn't want to be in an environment where inflation is ping-ponging back-and-forth. They want it to be in a clear downward trajectory.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was little changed from the previous day, finishing at 3.684%. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed on Tuesday following the Bank of Japan's announcement, driven by fear that Japanese investors might dump their U.S. Treasury holdings. That paused a weekslong rally for the 10-year note.</p><p>In individual stocks, Nike jumped $12.57, or 12%, to $115.78 after raising its revenue outlook and beating Wall Street's estimates. The retailer's largest one-day gain in 1.5 years made it the top performer in both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday. FedEx rose $5.64, or 3.4%, to $169.99 after reporting earnings that declined from a slowdown in global trade, but not as sharply as analysts had expected. Carnivaladded 38 cents, or 4.7%, to $8.48 after losing less than expected.</p><p>Crypto miners were among the stocks struggling the most, especially after Core Scientific's bankruptcy filing. Shares of Rite Aid fell 76 cents, or 17%, to $3.65 after plummeting demand for Covid-19 vaccinations and testing marred the drugstore operator's outlook.</p><p>Stocks' climb helped put pressure on volatility. With few catalysts on the immediate horizon to shake markets, the Cboe Volatility Index dropped to around 20, a level typically signifying calm and near the index's lows this year. Investors are still closely watching a few standout options trades for signals as to the where the market could be headed during the holiday season.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with global crude benchmark Brent advancing 2.8% to $82.20 a barrel. The U.S. plans to refill its oil reserve in February, which is backstopping prices, according to Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.3%.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 0.7%, declining for a second day after the Bank of Japan's policy change. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.7%.</p><p>Write to Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com and Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rally, Bolstered by Consumer Data</p>",
