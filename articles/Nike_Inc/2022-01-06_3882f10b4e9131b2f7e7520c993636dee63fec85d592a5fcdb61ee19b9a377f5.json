  "title": "Business News:  Chinese Brand Gains  In Sportswear Market  ----  By Stu Woo",
  "text": "<p>   While Western sportswear companies including Adidas AG and Puma SE lose sales in China over a consumer boycott, a homegrown rival is fast gaining ground. </p><p>   Anta Sports Products Ltd. was already China's top domestic sportswear brand. It benefited from control of its factories and stores, an endorsement deal with American basketball star Klay Thompson and sponsorships for the coming Beijing Winter Olympics, where it will clothe event staffers and Chinese athletes. </p><p>   In March, it got another boost. Chinese news outlets and social-media users called for a boycott of Western brands in an industry group that highlighted allegations about forced labor among minorities in China's cotton-rich Xinjiang region. Group members Adidas and Puma each reported third-quarter sales declines of about 15% in their Chinese markets, citing political challenges and other issues. Fellow member Nike Inc. said its sales there fell 20% in its latest quarter, though it pointed to supply-chain disruptions. </p><p>   After the backlash, most Western fashion brands stopped talking about Xinjiang. Anta did the opposite to fall in line with Beijing, which calls the forced-labor allegations lies. Anta quit the group that raised the human-rights concerns, saying it would keep using Xinjiang cotton. </p><p>   Anta, which declined to comment for this article, said revenue rose 56% in the first half of 2021 compared with the year-earlier period. In its latest financial report, it said \"guochao,\" a Chinese term meaning \"national tide,\" is making domestic brands more popular. </p><p>   Companies that do business in China are walking the line between addressing human-rights concerns and acquiescing to Beijing, which can choke access to the world's second-biggest economy. H&amp;M Hennes and Mauritz AB disappeared from Chinese e-commerce sites and map apps last year after raising Xinjiang-related concerns. </p><p>   A Nike spokeswoman declined to comment. Adidas didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   In industries such as sportswear, Chinese shoppers now have comparable homegrown alternatives such as Anta, which faces its own geopolitical challenges. </p><p>   A human-rights group this week criticized the International Olympic Committee for its ties with Anta, the official supplier of IOC uniforms and other apparel for next month's Beijing Games. </p><p>   The IOC said a third-party audit of its Anta-provided uniforms found no issues related to forced labor. </p><p>   Ranking third in market share behind Nike and Adidas in China, Anta has narrowed the gap in recent years, according to research-firm Euromonitor. </p><p>   Because of the size of China's sportswear market, valued at $50 billion a year and growing with the country's prosperity, Anta has become the world's fourth-biggest athletic-apparel company by market capitalization. </p><p></p>",
