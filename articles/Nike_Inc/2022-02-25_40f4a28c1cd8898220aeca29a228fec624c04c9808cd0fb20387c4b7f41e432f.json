  "title": "Foot Locker Shares Tumble Amid Weak Sales Forecast, Pledge to Cut Nike Purchases; Footwear and apparel seller cites efforts to overhaul business, waning boost from government stimulus",
  "text": "<p>Comparable sales, or sales at stores open for at least a year, are expected to decline by 8% to 10% this year, Foot Locker projected.</p><p>Without naming Nike Inc. in its earnings statement, Foot Locker said the downbeat forecast reflected efforts from a vendor to sell more goods directly to consumers and its own efforts to diversify its assortment of brands. Nike accounted for 75% of Foot Locker's merchandise purchases in 2020.</p><p>Foot Locker said Friday no one vendor would account for more than 60% of total purchases in the 2022 fiscal year.</p><p>\"Our journey to diversify our mix of business and expand our reach as a house of brands and banners is ongoing,\" Chief Executive Richard Johnson said.</p><p>The company also forecast adjusted earnings of $4.25 a share to $4.60 a share, lower than the $6.41 a share that analysts polled by FactSet expected.</p><p>In the latest quarter, which included the key holiday shopping season, sales grew to $2.34 billion from $2.19 billion a year earlier. Comparable-store sales grew by 0.8% in the quarter.</p><p>Foot Locker said apparel-sales trends significantly outpaced those for footwear. Analysts were expecting sales of $2.32 billion.</p><p>Net income declined 16% from a year earlier to $103 million, or $1.02 a share. Stripping out one-time items, Foot Locker's adjusted per-share earnings were $1.67, which came in ahead of analysts' forecasts.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Foot Locker Shares Tumble Amid Weak Sales Forecast, Pledge to Cut Nike Purchases</p>",
