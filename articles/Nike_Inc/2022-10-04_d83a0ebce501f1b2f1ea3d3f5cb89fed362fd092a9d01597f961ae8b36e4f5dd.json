  "title": "The $100 Sunglasses Minting Millions From 1980s Nostalgia; They belong on 'WWE Raw.' Or in the DeLorean with Doc. Yet Pit Viper shades, with all the subtlety of a gold-sequin unitard, are netting their ski-bro founders eight figures.",
  "text": "<p>In a classic story of ski bums made good, Pit Viper was started in 2012 by Chuck Mumford and Chris Garcin, competitive skiers who had the idea to re-create the broad-lensed shooting sunglasses from the 1990s that Mr. Mumford had found on eBay and taken to skiing in. The company launched with a Kickstarter campaign that raised just $38,648.</p><p>But over the past eight years, Pit Viper, with its awesomely '80s designs (imagine Terminator-sized lenses and Jazzercise color schemes) has grown into a small but boisterous player in the sunglass market. Most pairs retail between $49 and $119—and in the last 12 months, the company reported $40 million in revenue, selling more than 690,420 pairs of its UV-protective sunglasses.</p><p>Despite that irreverently exact stat, today Pit Viper insists it is working to professionalize its business, which has grown to 84 employees. \"For the last 10 years, everything has been completely from the hip,\" said Mr. Harkins. \"We're starting to become more strategic. This is the era of corporate Pit Viper.\"</p><p>Two years ago, the company appointed a new brand president, David Bottomley, who previously worked at outdoor-sports apparel brand Mammut. Next year, it plans to launch seven new sunglass styles, a significant increase in models over the 11 it has now, and will expand its nascent apparel line, Mr. Harkins said.</p><p>Pit Viper has also set its sights on new markets like the northeastern U.S. and Europe as it tries to avoid being pigeonholed as a rowdy Rocky Mountain brand for mulleted bros. Its roster of sponsored people on its website includes not just retired Super Bowl champion Rob Gronkowski but also Brehanna Daniels, the first Black woman to be a Nascar tire-changer. On Instagram, the company recently posted a video starring drag queen Pattie Gonia that promoted its \"Pride\" sunglasses and advised people not to be antigay or racist.</p><p>\"We're trying to expand our market,\" said Mr. Harkins. If Pit Viper's glasses are a wearable party, today, it's just opening up the guest list.</p><p>Addison Mitchell, 29, a sushi chef in Salt Lake City, at first didn't like the bro-y attitude of the brand nor the glasses' loud look, which was \"a lot of attention to draw to myself,\" she said.</p><p>But on a friend's recommendation, she tried Pit Viper and loved the durability: \"I haven't had any break,\" she said, despite flying around on a mountain bike. She's even come to appreciate the screaming colors, which she considers a lighthearted departure from more minimalist outdoor gear.</p><p>Internally, Pit Viper recently created its first employee handbook and set of brand guidelines which, said Mr. Harkins, \"basically is a list of all the times we've gone too far.\" When it comes to marketing, Pit Viper is a boundary pusher. Recent posts on its Instagram page—which has around 900,000 followers—depict a model chugging beer straight from the tap, a BMX crash, a dog urinating on a tree and a guy in a Speedo wearing a \"To do list: your mom\" shirt. Aside from sunglasses, extended middle fingers are the most common motif on its website. In many ways, Pit Viper's competitors aren't Ray-Ban or other eyeglass brands, but extreme-sports content companies like Nitro Circus and Jerry of the Day.</p><p>The rambunctious attitude has always been a draw for the brand. Last month, Alan Nguyen, 39, an IT professional in Alexandria, Va., came across a Pit Viper booth at a rock-climbing competition in Arkansas, where energetic representatives in wild clothes pitched the brand. He was pulled in and bought a pair, saying the glasses were \"just too fun not to buy.\"</p><p>Pit Vipers reminded him of the garish get-ups that wrestlers used to wear when he was younger, with their cheetah prints and lighting-bolt patterns running along the side.</p><p>Nostalgia is a big hook for Pit Viper converts. Mike Moore, 43, a marketing and data scientist in Fort Worth, Texas, said the fluorescent, full-shield glasses make him think of childhood heroes like NFL bad boy Brian Bosworth and Doc Brown from \"Back to the Future.\" Pit Viper feels like \"something that was pulled out of the '80s that we never got—that we should have got,\" he said. Now it's \"somehow shown up in our world.\" (After buying and wearing the glasses on his own, Mr. Moore, a small-time videogame streamer, later received some free pairs from the brand to wear during his broadcasts—part of Pit Viper's multifarious marketing approach.)</p><p>But the brand's bawdiness does receive blowback. Each time it posts an innuendo-laden joke to Facebook, angry emails roll in. Last year on Easter, a highly off-color Instagram post caused fans to revolt. Now, said Mr. Harkins, religious jokes are off limits—part of Pit Viper's attempt to professionalize itself.</p><p>Well, only a tad. The brand knows that its core appeal is in being outrageous. People come to Nike for inspiring basketball ads, they come to Pit Viper for clips of guys face-planting off motorcycles. And Mr. Harkins said that even with brand guidelines, \"we think that immature sex jokes are always OK.\"</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>MORE IN ON TREND</p><p>* The Beer Koozie-Like Shoe Selling Out Across America</p><p>* The Clothes That Make the King</p><p>* This Men's Pants Style Is Back—and For All Ages</p><p>* This 67-Year-Old Jacket Maker Came Out of Retirement—to More Fanfare Than Ever</p><p>* Why Balenciaga's $1,790 Garbage Bag Is Already a Success</p><p>The $100 Sunglasses Minting Millions From 1980s Nostalgia</p>",
