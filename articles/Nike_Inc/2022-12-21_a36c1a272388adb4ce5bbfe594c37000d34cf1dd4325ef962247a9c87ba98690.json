  "text": "<p>Consumer confidence data jumped sharply in December to its highest level since April. Sentiment around the economy and labor market improved, while inflation expectations for the year ahead dipped to 6.7%—the lowest in more than a year.</p><p>Housing market data painted a mixed picture. Existing-home sales fell for a 10th straight month in November to extend the longest streak of declines on record. However, home prices also dropped 2.1% from the prior month to their lowest since February.</p><p>A more confident consumer along with falling prices—as well as price expectations—are likely welcome news for Federal Reserve officials. Reining in inflation without causing a major recession remains front and center for central bankers heading into the new year.</p><p>\"Overall, the data offered a mixed take on the state of the real economy—albeit consistent with the Fed's objectives at this state in the cycle,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a Wednesday note.</p><p>Wednesday's data helped reverse recent stock-market moves after rising risk of recession dampened investor's outlook. The Bank of Japan's change to its yield curve control policy had also driven concerns about tighter financial conditions globally.</p><p>The approaching holiday period also means fewer people are trading and reduced liquidity, which can lead to outsize moves in markets.</p><p>\"Markets have been down quite significantly over the past four or five days, that's likely driving a bit of buying into the year-end,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>Funds are typically undergoing a process known as rebalancing at this time of year, where they buy and sell assets to get back to their targeted allocations. \"There's also likely to be a marginal buyer of equities at the moment because equities have underperformed bonds this year,\" Mr. Ganesh said.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 3.649% compared with 3.683% the previous day.</p><p>In individual stocks, Nike jumped 13% after raising its revenue outlook and beating Wall Street's estimates. FedEx rose 4.1% after reporting earnings that declined from a slowdown in global trade, but not as sharply as analysts had expected. Carnival and Micron Technology are scheduled to post quarterly results Wednesday.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with global crude benchmark Brent advancing 2% to trade at $81.58 a barrel. The U.S. plans to refill its oil reserve in February which is backstopping prices, according to Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.3%.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 0.7%, declining for a second day after the Bank of Japan's policy change. The yen stabilized, edging down 0.2% against the dollar after soaring 3.9% the day before.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.3%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Bolstered by Consumer Data</p>",
