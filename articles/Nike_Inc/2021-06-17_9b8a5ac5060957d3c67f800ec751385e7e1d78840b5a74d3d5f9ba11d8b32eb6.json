  "text": "<p>Sports Direct is set to expand into major UK and European cities as owner Frasers Group looks to improve the chain's relations with key brands and take on arch-rival JD Sports.</p> <p>Unveiling a £10m revamp of its 50,000 square foot store on London's Oxford Street, Frasers' head of “elevation” Michael Murray said the group would consider both acquisitions and incremental opportunities to build its presence over the next five years.</p> <p>“We have a strong and compelling five-year plan to become the partner of choice for brands,” he said. “We've spent three years testing, learning and building confidence with our partners”.</p> <p>Although Sports Direct has significant operations in Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Ireland and the Baltic states, unlike its rival it lacks flagship stores in key continental cities that brands such as Adidas, Nike, Puma and Under Armour increasingly demand.</p> <p>JD has more stores in Berlin and Paris alone than Sports Direct has in the whole of Germany and France.</p> <p>Sports Direct has complained in the past that brands have not been quick enough to reward its efforts to take stores upmarket by giving it better access to top-tier products. </p> <p>But Murray said the situation had improved markedly in recent months, pointing to a new £6m marketing campaign developed in conjunction with brands and featuring footballers Jack Grealish and Bruno Fernandes.</p> <p>The new-look London store features extensive use of technology, including gaming stations where members of the public can take on professional footballers along with services such as gait analysis for runners and fitting for sports bras.</p> <p>Leading brands dominate the sales area, with Sports Direct-owned labels such as Lonsdale and Slazenger relegated to the periphery, and there is not an oversized tea mug or a “Mega Value” sticker to be seen.</p> <p>About a quarter of the group's 400 UK stores have now been “elevated”, and Murray said the eventual ambition was to do all of them.</p> <p>John Ryan, a commentator on store design and experience, said the Oxford Street store was “basically a bigger version of what they have been doing for some time now” rather than a transformational concept. “It's not bad . . . though I don't think people should be expecting inspiration in this mass-market price bracket”.</p> <p>“It looks like they are trying to do what Primark has been doing for a while and putting flagship stores of a certain size in key locations,” he said of the planned expansion into Europe. </p> <p>Murray, who is highly influential within Frasers Group despite being on neither the board nor the payroll, cautioned against extrapolating the relatively high cost of the Oxford Street fit-out across the entire estate, saying specification varied by location and by size of store.</p> <p>“We have stores ranging from 5,000 square feet to 50,000,” he said, adding that more flagships were likely in UK cities such as Manchester and Birmingham.</p> <p>But he did not say what the total cost might be or set out any targets for store openings. In its last financial year, capital spending within the UK sports retail operations was £111m, with a further £14m spent in Europe. </p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Sports Direct plans push into Europe' FT.com 17 June.
