  "text": "<p>Fast Retailing needs both China and the US for its future. The owner of Japanese fast-fashion chain Uniqlo plans to increase investment in China, its biggest foreign market. While the US offers more growth potential, expansion there will require making tough political choices.</p> <p>Fast Retailing will this year begin operating an <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Uniqlo-parent-expands-automated-warehouse-network-into-China\">automated warehouse</a> in the Shanghai area as part of a ¥100bn ($865m) global investment plan to adapt to a changing retail environment.</p> <p>It is the right move. Global logistics disruptions plus the impact of ageing populations in Uniqlo's main markets of Japan and China, which provide 80 per cent of revenue, have swollen labour costs. Automation is crucial.</p> <p>Yet any savings from replacing labour with capital will not boost group operating margins quickly enough. Fast Retailing depends on Uniqlo for much of its turnover. Margins peaked in 2012 at more than 13 per cent, averaging 200 basis points less ever since. Fast Retailing expects same-store sales to drop 11 per cent in the year to August.</p> <p>Shares in Fast Retailing are down 35 per cent over the past year, compared with a 8 per cent gain for Zara's Spanish parent Inditex. Yet at 33 times forward earnings Fast Retailing shares trade at a 50 per cent premium to Inditex. </p> <p>The Japanese retailer must now rely on the US for growth, one of the few remaining major markets where apparel demand remains strong. That will not be easy. It has only 43 Uniqlo outlets stores there, compared with nearly 1,700 in both Japan and China. </p> <p>Moreover, fashion chains dependent upon Chinese inputs, labour and materials carry political risk. Use of cotton from Xinjiang is a contentious issue between America and China. US customs <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/uniqlo-shirts-blocked-us-border-january-china-forced-labour-concern-2021-05-19/#:~:text=TOKYO%2C%20May%2019%20(Reuters),been%20reports%20of%20forced%20labour.\">blocked </a>a shipment of Uniqlo shirts last year due to forced labour concerns in Xinjiang. Though the retailer has denied the allegations, it faces pressure to take a side in the debate. Peers H&amp;M&#xa0;and Nike already have.</p> <p>Its valuation gap with Inditex and other peers has begun to close in the past year. That contraction should continue this year.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Fast Retailing: political risk remains biggest challenge to growth' FT.com 11 January.
