  "title": "U.S. News: Avenatti Is Sentenced to 2 1/2 Years For Extortion Attempt Against Nike",
  "text": "<p>The case grew out of Mr. Avenatti's threats to expose purported corruption in Nike's elite basketball program unless the apparel giant paid him to conduct an internal investigation.</p><p>Before handing down the sentence, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe called Mr. Avenatti's conduct outrageous and said he operated as if laws that apply to everyone else didn't apply to him.</p><p>\"Mr. Avenatti had become drunk on the power of his platform,\" Judge Gardephe said in a Manhattan federal courtroom.</p><p>The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office had asked Judge Gardephe to impose a \"very substantial sentence\" in line with probation officials' recommendation of eight years imprisonment.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti \"betrayed his client's trust and sought to enrich himself by weaponizing his public profile in an attempt to extort a publicly traded company out of tens of millions of dollars.\"</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Avenatti proposed a six-month prison term, noting his convicted offenses weren't violent and didn't cause financial loss.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti sought, unsuccessfully, to have the verdict overturned and says he wasn't allowed to present important evidence at trial.</p><p>His lawyers have previously said they would pursue an appeal.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti, fighting back tears, told the judge that he was grateful for the love of his family, even when he least deserved it. He said he had always wanted to fight for the little guy against the Goliaths. \"For years, I did just that,\" he said. \"But I lost my way.\"</p><p>Judge Gardephe cited several reasons in handing down a sentence below that recommended by federal guidelines, including Mr. Avenatti's remorse in court and what he called horrific conditions at the New York federal jail where Mr. Avenatti had been held.</p><p>Thursday's sentencing caps just one of Mr. Avenatti's legal battles. He also faces a litany of tax and bank charges in California, with a trial set to begin next week in federal court in Santa Ana, Calif.</p><p>A trial in New York is scheduled to start next year on federal charges that he embezzled money from Ms. Daniels, an adult-film actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.</p><p>Mr. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>Judge Gardephe ordered Mr. Avenatti to report to prison on Sept. 15, after what is expected to be the conclusion of his trial in California. When Mr. Avenatti leaves prison, he will face three years of supervised release, Judge Gardephe ordered.</p><p>Based in Southern California, Mr. Avenatti had a reputation as a rainmaker and a showman even before his representation of Ms. Daniels made him a household name.</p><p>In 2018, after The Wall Street Journal revealed a hush-money payment made to the adult film star to conceal her alleged sexual encounter with former President Donald Trump, Mr. Avenatti became a combative and telegenic staple on nightly news shows.</p><p>But Mr. Avenatti's business affairs had been unraveling for years, court filings show. By early 2019, prosecutors showed at trial, Mr. Avenatti was about $11 million in debt, and a probe by the Internal Revenue Service in California had become a criminal investigation into his business and financial affairs.</p><p>In a statement provided by a spokeswoman, Nike said: \"The verdict and sentence speak for themselves.\"</p>",
