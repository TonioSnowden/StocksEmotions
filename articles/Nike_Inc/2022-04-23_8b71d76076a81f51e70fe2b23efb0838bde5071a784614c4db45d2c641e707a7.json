  "title": "A Health Scare Turned This Grammy-Nominated Pianist Into an Athlete; After multiple back-to-back performances, Christian Sands woke up unable to move his fingers or forearms; 'I needed a routine for longevity'",
  "text": "<p>Jazz pianist Christian Sands says he prepares for a concert like LeBron James prepares for a basketball game.</p><p>\"I consider myself an athlete,\" says the Grammy-nominated musician. \"Performing two 90-minute sets is the equivalent of running a marathon with your fingers.\"</p><p>These days, Mr. Sands, 32 years old, also addresses his own physical health with the same mind-set, following a health scare in January 2020. After playing a piano and an electric piano simultaneously for multiple back-to-back performances he woke up unable to move his fingers or forearms.</p><p>\"I've played the piano every day for nearly 30 years and have never experienced pain,\" he says. \"Music is my identity so I freaked out.\"</p><p>After watching video footage of his performances, a physical therapist noted how his neck strained between the pianos. The unnatural posture was pinching his nerves and causing stabbing pain and numbness. In his teens and 20s, Mr. Sands didn't exercise or warm-up before a show. He relied on the invincibility of youth to get away with little sleep and late-night performances on tour.</p><p>After his scare, he started to study how Mr. James, 37, has been able to maintain peak performance as he ages. \"Most musicians don't retire,\" he said. \"We play until we die. I needed a routine for longevity.\"</p><p>His physical therapist helped him correct his posture at the piano—arms extended but bent roughly 120 degrees and chest eight-ninths of an inch away from the keys—and developed a series of stretches and strengthening exercises he can do at home or on the road, which is 85% of the time.</p><p>As a pianist, the muscles in his hands never get a rest. If he's not tapping keys, he's texting, typing on his laptop, or dragging bags to the next concert venue. Mr. Sands notes different styles of pianos have different key resistance and he has to be ready for whatever awaits him on stage. Playing a Steinway is like hitting a heavy weight punching bag, where playing the super light keys of a Fazioli feels like tapping a feather, he says.</p><p>After a year-and-a-half without live performances because of the pandemic, he says his workouts have been more important than ever.</p><p>\"The first time I tried to perform live for 45 minutes my hands and body were fatigued,\" he said. \"Like any athlete, you have to train to regain your stamina.\" He is currently touring in the U.S. and will be the 2022 artist in residence at the Monterey Jazz Festival in California this September.</p><p>​​The Workout</p><p>Mr. Sands begins the day with 10 to 30 minutes of meditation. \"It gives me the energy I need to start my day,\" he says.</p><p>Twice a day, and always before a performance, Mr. Sands stretches his hands, wrists and arms. He extends a straight right arm, palm facing up and uses his left hand to gently bend his fingers toward the floor. This stretches the front of his forearm and wrist. To stretch the back of his forearm he extends a straight right arm, palm facing down, and makes a loose fist. He pulls the fist down toward the floor with his left hand until he feels a stretch. He holds both stretches for 20 seconds and repeats three times per arm.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How does your workout help keep you in shape for your professional career? Join the conversation below.</p><p>For neural mobility, he stands with his arms by his sides, palms facing forward and swings his arms back until he finds a gentle stretch then swings them back to his side repeating 20 to 30 times. After a warm shower, he uses his percussive massage tool on his forearms and palms. After a performance he repeats the forearm and wrist stretches and takes a 10- to 20-minute ice bath followed by a warm shower.</p><p>He developed a resistance band routine for the road. Exercises include variations of band pull aparts to work his shoulders and upper back, band biceps curls, band dead lifts, and band push-ups where he loops the resistance band around his upper back and holds each end down with his hands. He typically does two to three sets of 10 to 20 reps. He sticks to light resistance to ensure his muscles are never sore for a performance.</p><p>He has a gym at his Stamford, Conn., apartment and will occasionally run on the treadmill and lift free weights.</p><p>The Diet</p><p>Breakfast: Eggs, bacon, whole wheat toast with jam, and coffee. He makes orange, pomegranate or a green juice in his juicer.</p><p>Home cooking: Mr. Sands enjoys cooking and has been trying to prepare more vegan meals. \"I'm still trying to figure out how to season and cook the Beyond [Meat] burger patties,\" he says. \"They don't cook the same way a beef burger does.\"</p><p>Healthy substitutions: Instead of sugar he uses honey to sweeten both his coffee and tea. He uses chickpea rice and chickpea pasta as a base for veggies, fish and chicken.</p><p>Lunch strategy: To avoid skipping lunch when days are busy, he tries to always have leftovers, such as homemade chicken ramen, in the fridge to quickly heat up.</p><p>In his travel bag: He always travels with loose leaf green and mint teas and honey.</p><p>Splurge: \"I can eat a whole row of Oreos,\" he admits.</p><p>Essential Gear</p><p>Sneakers: Nike Air VaporMax ($210)</p><p>Apparel: Mr. Sands is a fan of Lululemon and Nike workout gear. \"I wish Nike would do a collaboration with Steinway so musicians had their own athletic apparel line,\" he says.</p><p>Always in his carry on: His Therabody Theragun mini ($200) and INNELO resistance band set ($30 on Amazon).</p><p>Playlist: Kanye West, jazz musician Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, or John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme\" album.</p><p>What's your workout?</p><p>* Six Exercises for Mountain Bike Newbies and Veterans</p><p>* This 83-Year-Old Can Beat You—and Maybe Stephen Curry—at Free Throws</p><p>* From Pandemic Walks to an Ultramarathon Gauntlet</p><p>What's your workout?
