  "title": "Business News: Chinese Apparel Labels Step Up Their Game To Rival Nike, Adidas",
  "text": "<p>HSBC analyst Lina Yan said the two are the only domestic brands expanding their shares of the Chinese market.</p><p>Anta ranks third and Li Ning fourth in China, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International, trailing only Nike Inc. and Adidas AG. And the Chinese companies' stock-price gains beat both: Nike has risen 62% in the 12 months to Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $217 billion, while Adidas is up 37%.</p><p>In the past two weeks, local apparel stocks including Anta and Li Ning have also gotten a boost from a Chinese boycott of international businesses that have shunned cotton produced in the western Xinjiang region over forced-labor concerns.</p><p>That suggests investors expect the boycott to lift domestic brands' sales at the expense of Nike and Adidas, which have been embroiled in the controversy. Analysts see that confidence as premature.</p><p>\"It's too early to tell if the saga could boost sales,\" said Tony Li, an analyst at Haitong International.</p><p>More broadly, though, younger Chinese consumers increasingly favor domestic brands as they catch up with foreign brands in quality and innovation -- a long-term trend that should work in favor of Anta and Li Ning.</p><p>The two Chinese giants have taken different approaches. Anta sells brands such as Fila and Descente in China, as well as clothes and shoes bearing its own name. Li Ning, founded by the Olympic gymnast of the same name, focuses on a single brand.</p><p>Both companies have international sponsorship deals: In basketball, Anta works with Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, for example, while Li Ning has signed players such as Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet and Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler.</p>",
