  "title": "Nike's Inventories Jump 44% Ahead of Holiday Season; Sneaker giant reports 4% growth in quarterly sales and 22% drop in net income",
  "text": "<p>For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Nike reported revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% compared with a year earlier. Earnings fell 22% to $1.5 billion—but the results were largely in line with analysts' expectations.</p><p>As the holiday-shopping season nears and with uncertainty around consumer retail spending, analysts said Nike is still recovering from production delays and longer transit times that created bottlenecks in its business.</p><p>Nike has braced investors for tepid sales growth and slimmer profits that are in part the result of discounting. Analysts expected revenue of $12.28 billion to be roughly flat for the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the consensus estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>In June, Nike forecast that sales would increase by a low single-digit percentage this fiscal year, when setting aside currency fluctuations. On that basis, sales rose 10% in the August quarter.</p><p>\"It really all depends on the consumer environment and how much they spend, as we get further into the holiday season,\" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández.</p><p>Nike's share price is down about 42% so far this year, compared with a 23% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Nike dealt with delays of up to 10 weeks last year, as Covid-19-related lockdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia resulted in factory closures. Transit times have improved since then but still were roughly two weeks longer than before the pandemic, Nike said in June. The company said it also reduced the amount of inventory it was getting from factories in China for the coming seasons.</p><p>The Beaverton, Ore., company has said it would work with its wholesale partners to discount merchandise to help clear excess inventory. Retailers like Foot Locker Inc., Hibbett Inc. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., which all carry Nike merchandise, said recently that they have received long-awaited inventory from vendors but also noted stiff competition on price in the marketplace.</p><p>Richard Johnson, who now serves as executive chairman of Foot Locker, said last month that the footwear industry has returned to 2019 levels, in terms of how many products were being discounted. Nike accounted for 70% of Foot Locker's merchandise purchases in 2021, and the retailer has said no one vendor would account for more than 60% of total purchases in the future.</p><p>Executives from retail chain Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors Inc. said this month that for two years people haven't needed to be motivated by promotions, amid fears that products would be in short supply, especially closer to the holidays.</p><p>\"People are starting to get back into the place where they're used to seeing the shelves full,\" Academy Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Lawrence said on an earnings conference call with analysts.</p><p>More discounting is also expected in China, which accounts for roughly 17% of Nike's annual revenue, to clear some of the seasonal products that arrived late because they were in transit for too long.</p><p>Covid lockdowns and factory closures in China have hurt Nike's operations in the country, where about 30% of its footwear and 20% of its apparel is manufactured, according to the company's annual report.</p><p>On Thursday, Nike reported sales in China decreased 16% in the August quarter. The company said sales rose by more than 10% in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.</p><p>In early August, executives at Adidas AG said the company would have to take back close to $400 million of product from its retailers in China and that it expected discounts to be particularly pronounced in the region.</p><p>Nike's Inventories Jump 44% Ahead of Holiday Season</p>",
