  "text": "<p>Richardson's period of ineligibility began June 28, the date of her provisional suspension.</p><p>Her sanction was reduced to one month because her use of cannabis occurred out of competition and was unrelated to sport performance, and because she successfully completed a counseling program regarding her use of cannabis, according to USADA.</p><p>USA Track and Field uses Olympic-trials results to qualify athletes in individual events, but it's possible the governing body could select Richardson for the Olympic 4x100-meter relay on Aug. 6.</p><p>\"Sha'Carri Richardson's situation is incredibly unfortunate and devastating for everyone involved,\" USATF said in a statement Friday morning. \"Athlete health and well-being continue to be one of USATF's most critical priorities and we will work with Sha'Carri to ensure she has ample resources to overcome any mental health challenges now and in the future.\"</p><p>USATF didn't immediately respond to follow-up questions.</p><p>Richardson tested positive for \"the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, marijuana,\" according to USADA, in a test on June 19, the day she won the 100-meter dash at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.</p><p>Marijuana is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's in-competition prohibited list, and can lead to an anti-doping rule violation and sanction if an athlete doesn't secure ahead of time a therapeutic-use exemption, according to USADA.</p><p>\"I want to take responsibility for my actions,\" Richardson said in an interview Friday morning on the \"Today\" show. \"I know what I did. I know what I'm supposed to do, [what] I'm allowed not to do and I still made that decision.\"</p><p>Before the news broke on Thursday, Richardson tweeted \"I am human\" from her verified account.</p><p>News of the failed test was first reported by the Jamaica Gleaner.</p><p>Richardson's sponsor, Nike, said in a statement, \"We appreciate Sha'Carri's honesty and accountability and will continue to support her through this time.\"</p><p>In April, Richardson ran the second-fastest time of the year, 10.72 seconds, behind the 10.63 of Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a three-time Olympic medalist in the event.</p>",
