  "title": "Business News:  Nike's Sales, Net Income Decline  As Stores Report Excess Inventory  ----  By Inti Pacheco",
  "text": "<p>   Nike Inc.'s quarterly sales were roughly flat and its inventory surged, signs that the sneaker maker is still trying to balance consumer demand with supply-chain snarls. </p><p>   Executives said they were optimistic as the company starts a new fiscal year because production has surpassed prepandemic levels. They forecast stronger revenue growth for the year started June 1 but said near-term profit would be hurt by elevated shipping costs. </p><p>    Matthew Friend, Nike's finance chief, said the company was monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of high inflation on demand. He said Nike would take a cautious approach in China given uncertainty around additional Covid disruptions. </p><p>   He also said the company would be raising prices on some items by a mid-single digit percentage. </p><p>   \"We will stay focused on what we can control,\" Mr. Friend said on a conference call. </p><p>   For the quarter ended May 31, total sales decreased 1% to $12.2 billion. Net income fell 5% to $1.44 billion, or 90 cents a share. The fiscal fourth-quarter results were better than Wall Street analysts had predicted. </p><p>   Revenue in the North American market, which accounts for the majority of total sales, declined 5% to $5.1 billion. Sales in China declined 19% to $1.56 billion, mostly because of Covid-19 restrictions in the country. </p><p>   Sales jumped in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia, compared with a year ago. </p><p>   Some retailers have reported having excess inventory and having to sell products at a discount. </p><p>   Supply-chain disruptions are still having an impact on Nike's flow of goods, Mr. Friend said. </p><p>   The company is paying about five times the prepandemic rate it paid to put its products in a container and move them from Asia to the U.S. Transit times remain elevated and aren't expected to significantly improve during the coming fiscal year. </p><p>   The company reported a 23% increase in inventory in the May quarter compared with the prior year. </p><p></p>",
