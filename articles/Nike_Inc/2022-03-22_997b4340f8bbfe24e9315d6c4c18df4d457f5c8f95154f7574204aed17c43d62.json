  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 278 points, or 0.8%, to 34,832.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 47 points, or 1%, to 4,509.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 237 points, or 1.7%, at 14,075.</p><p>Stocks stumbled Monday after Powell said the central bank could deliver hikes of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, in future meetings, but ended the day well off session lows. The Dow fell 0.6%, snapping a five-day winning streak, while the S&amp;P 500 finished fractionally lower and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Treasury yields surged following Powell's remarks on Monday and were extending the rise Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury note yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Ywas at 2.366%, up around 4 basis points after rising to its highest since May 2019 on Monday.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said Tuesday morning that 50 basis point moves should definitely be “in the mix” as the Fed moves interest rates higher. Bullard dissented at the Fed's meeting last week in favor of a 50 basis point hike instead of the 25 basis point move that policy makers approved.</p><p>Read:Bullard, Waller back aggressive policy stance</p><p>There's more commentary coming from Federal Reserve officials Tuesday, including New York Fed President John Williams.</p><p>Powell's remarks showed that the Fed is now firmly in inflation-fighting mode, which is bad news for bonds but more nuanced for stocks, said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>“We still see a path to markets ending the year higher. Although there is widespread criticism, it's too early to take the view that the Fed won't be able to negotiate the fine line of reducing inflation without derailing growth,” he said, in a note.</p><p>Haefele said amid the high degree of uncertainty, UBS prefers selected overweight and underweight positions, yielding an overall neutral allocation to equities. Investors should brace for higher interest rates, considering exposure to U.S. senior loans and equity sectors that typically outperform in the current environment, including value stocks and financials.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia intensified air and sea attacks across Ukraine, as President Joe Biden encouraged U.S. companies to harden their cyber defenses against Russia.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts said markets have rebounded but only commodities and the dollar are above their preinvasion peak.</p><p>“With global central banks maintaining their hawkish stance and focus on inflation, the shorter duration, value pockets have led the rebound contributing to last week's outperformance of European equities,” said London-based Goldman strategists led by Cecilia Mariotti.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Okta Inc.OKTA, the authentication company, said it was investigating images purporting to show a hack of their internal system, though the hacking group is believed to be based in Brazil. In a tweet, Okta CEO Todd McKinnon said there was no evidence to date of ongoing malicious activity, Barrons' reported. Shares fell more than 4%.</p><p>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.BABA announced late Monday that it was boosting the size of its share-buyback program, with the Chinese e-commerce giant is authorizing repurchases of as much as $25 billion in shares, up from $15 billion.
