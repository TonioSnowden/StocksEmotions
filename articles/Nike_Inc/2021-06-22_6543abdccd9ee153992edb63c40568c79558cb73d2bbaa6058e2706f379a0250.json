  "title": "Sports:  The Nets Had a Big Three and One Too Many Injuries  ----  By Ben Cohen",
  "text": "<p>   The Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz were the betting favorites to win the NBA championship at the beginning of the playoffs. Now they have something else in common: They are out -- and so were their best players. </p><p>   LeBron James and the defending champion Lakers lost in the first round after Anthony Davis injured his groin. </p><p>   The Jazz had the league's best record and still lost in the second round because Mike Conley missed five games with a strained hamstring while Donovan Mitchell was limping around on a sprained ankle. </p><p>   Then it was the Nets' turn for their All-Star point guard and shooting guard to get hurt. </p><p>   The Nets already had plenty of experience with the unpleasantness of injuries by then. They were so decimated that Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving were on the court together for only 202 minutes. They came into the playoffs as the basketball version of a TikTok. Never had so much time been devoted to making sense of so little time. </p><p>   They were healthy when the playoffs began -- until they weren't. Harden strained his hamstring. Irving sprained his ankle. Durant was so brilliant that they almost survived anyway. But not even the game's most transcendent player was enough for the Nets to beat their injury problems. </p><p>   It isn't an excuse. It's an explanation. And it happens to be a common one. </p><p>   The single most powerful force shaping this year's NBA playoffs has been player health. </p><p>   Harden and Irving were among the nine All-Stars who have missed games in the NBA playoffs because of injuries and medical protocols. </p><p>   Those notable absences were felt over the weekend as Irving watched from the bench and Harden was barely ambulatory on the court, Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid played through a torn meniscus as the No. 1 seed in the East unraveled at the hands of the ascendant Atlanta Hawks, and the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers were both incomplete at the start of the Western Conference Finals. </p><p>   Devin Booker had to be sensational for the Suns to take a 1-0 lead on Sunday since they didn't have Chris Paul, who was sidelined by the league's health and safety protocols while off last week. Only in this pandemic season can NBA teams lose players even when they're not playing. (While the Suns have been coy about Paul's status, the league announced last week that one player had tested positive for Covid-19, and ESPN reported that Paul had been vaccinated.) </p><p>   Meanwhile, the Clippers are dealing with a significant, mysterious absence of their own, as Kawhi Leonard is out indefinitely with a knee injury. It's unclear if he'll return this season and if his team can hang around long enough to get him back. </p><p>   Groins. Hamstrings. Knees. Feet. The injuries that can fill a medical textbook have blurred the league's championship picture, distorted the long-term futures of teams and turned the playoffs into a basketball war of attrition. </p><p>   The games themselves are still tense, and the performances are still thrilling. But what the last month has made painfully clear is that even the world's most graceful athletes are one step away from the entire league being thrown into chaos. </p><p>   This was more of a reminder than a revelation. The forgotten truth of the NBA is that almost every title is won because of sublime play -- and suboptimal timing. </p><p>   The last three champions might have been different if not for some lousy injury luck along the way. In 2018, when the Houston Rockets had the Golden State Warriors on the ropes, a hamstring injury sidelined Paul and flipped the series. The Warriors then found themselves on the wrong side of randomness in 2019, when Durant ruptured his Achilles tendon, Klay Thompson tore his ACL and the Toronto Raptors won the championship because they kept Leonard healthy. </p><p>   It would have been hard enough for the Miami Heat to beat James, Davis and the Lakers in 2020, but it proved impossible without two starters who helped get them to the bubble Finals. </p><p>   No team understood the fragility of a title pursuit before this year better than the Nets. </p><p>   Durant, Harden and Irving might not be wearing the same uniform if not for injuries that derailed teams with championship hopes at pivotal moments in their careers. </p><p>   When they were healthy, the Nets were terrifying. They looked every bit as unbeatable as the rest of the league feared. Durant, Harden and Irving played together for 130 minutes -- nearly as many in five games as the full regular season -- and outscored teams by 23.7 points per 100 possessions. That made them the single best three-man lineup in the NBA playoffs. </p><p>   They wouldn't play another minute together. </p><p>   On the very first play of their first game against the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Harden tweaked his hamstring, which meant the entire series changed before Giannis Antetokounmpo touched the ball. </p><p>   Harden somehow returned to play 46 minutes in Game 5 and a career-high 53 minutes in Game 7, and he was actually pretty effective for someone with one leg. But the only thing recognizable about this diminished version of Harden was his facial hair. </p><p>   The irony of the Nets being undone by injuries was the reason they traded for Harden: to protect themselves against Durant or Irving getting hurt. He was Brooklyn's heavily bearded insurance policy. </p><p>   Even if they didn't have three stars, they figured, they would have a chance to survive with two. </p><p>   But when Irving sprained his ankle by freakishly landing on Antetokounmpo's foot in Game 4, the league's most tantalizing collection of three major talents was suddenly down to one. </p><p>   \"I can't even speak for how much we missed Kyrie out on the floor and how much we missed James to start the series,\" said Durant, who was nearly enough by himself. </p><p>   Those injuries made their margin for error minuscule, and that would be the margin that decided their season. </p><p>   The Nets were so depleted by the end of a brutal series that the best offense in NBA history scored only two points in overtime of Game 7. But if his toe hadn't been on the line for a game-tying 2-pointer at the end of regulation, Durant's shot would have been a game-winning 3-pointer. </p><p>   The difference between the Nets being eliminated and the Nets being championship favorites turned out to be the size of a Nike sneaker. </p><p>   The playoffs were supposed to be a referendum on this fantastically strange basketball experiment. </p><p>   They weren't. </p><p>   It's still hard to know what to make of the NBA's most fascinating enigma, since Durant, Harden and Irving barely played together and yet found themselves one inch away from the conference finals. </p><p>   But what they did learn was that it wasn't enough for the Nets or anyone else to be the best team. They also had to be the healthiest. </p><p></p>",
