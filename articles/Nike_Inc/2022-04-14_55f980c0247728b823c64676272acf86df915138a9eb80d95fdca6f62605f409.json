  "title": "If Musk's $43 billion Twitter takeover falls apart, who else has enough money to buy the company? Not many people have, or can secure, the funds required to acquire Twitter",
  "text": "<p>While Twitter says it will \"carefully review\" Musk's \"unsolicited\" bid, it poses at least two hypotheticals: Who would have enough money to buy it, and who might have the interest in actually doing so?</p><p>Don't miss: Twitter employees blanch at prospect of Musk ownership</p><p>Musk is by far the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $273 billion, and spending $43 billion on a Twitter buyout wouldn't dent his fortune excessively, even were he to go it alone and pay cash, assuming a capacity to extract liquidity from, for example, his Tesla TSLA holdings without undermining valuation.</p><p>Musk's offer is also much higher than Twitter's $36.71 billion market cap as of Thursday morning (but, as Cowen analyst John Blackledge observed, hardly such a rich offer that the board would have a hard time batting it away from a fiduciary-duty standpoint).</p><p>See: Here's how Elon Musk's buyout offer for Twitter stacks up to what he paid for his stake</p><p>Using Forbes' billionaires list, 29 people have the fortune to match or exceed Musk's $43 billion offer to buy Twitter. Those names include titans of industry like Amazon's AMZN Jeff Bezos and Nike NKE founder Phil Knight, as well as Mike Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg and MacKenzie Scott.</p><p>Obviously, these names are just those who theoretically could afford to put in a bid for Twitter, not that they necessarily have tangible interest in owning the company.</p><p>The 29 billionaires on the list who could match Musk's offer also include many tech moguls. Microsoft's MSFT Bill Gates, Oracle's ORCL Larry Ellison and Google's GOOG Sergey Brin all have tech backgrounds and the money to buy the company.</p><p>Others on the list, like Bernard Arnault, whose vast fashion empire includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, could also afford to bid for Twitter, but may be less likely due to their lack of experience in the tech industry.</p><p>So who among these eligible buyers might hypothetically have the most interest?</p><p>Jeff Bezos is an obvious choice. With a $181 billion fortune, he can afford it, and he already has shown an interest in media properties as evidenced by his purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.</p><p>Michael Bloomberg, former Democratic presidential candidate and former mayor of New York, also fits the bill. Bloomberg's net worth exceeds $82 billion and he also has a strong interest in media properties as he cofounded financial information and media company Bloomberg LP in 1981.</p><p>An under-the-radar name for this exercise could be Zhang Yiming. As the cofounder of ByteDance, the company that owns social media platform TikTok, Yiming is one of China's richest people, with a net worth of $49.5 billion.</p><p>Hypothetical bids from some of these billionaires would likely raise regulatory concerns. Any takeover plans from Zuckerberg or either of the Google founders, for example, could lead to concerns of monopolistic behavior.</p><p>It's unclear at this time if Twitter is going to be receptive to any sort of a takeover.</p><p>Twitter reportedly is holding an all-hands meeting with employees on Thursday afternoon to discuss Musk's bid for the company.</p><p>Jefferies Equity Research Analyst Brent Thill opined that it could be a company, not an individual, who looks to buy Twitter. Thill named cloud-based software company Salesforce CRM and Microsoft as possibilities, citing Microsoft's recent success with LinkedIn.</p><p>\"It's hard to see who the next logical player would be,\" he said.</p><p>Thill was also skeptical that this is truly Musk's \"best and final\" bid for Twitter.</p><p>He wondered, \"Could Elon go higher?\"</p><p>If Musk's $43 billion Twitter takeover falls apart, who else has enough money to buy the company?</p>",
