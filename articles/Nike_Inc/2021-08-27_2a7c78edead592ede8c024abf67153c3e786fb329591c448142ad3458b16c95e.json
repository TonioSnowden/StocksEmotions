  "text": "<p>Running shoes have come a long way from the plimsolls or “road slappers” army recruits once had to wear. The name of Swiss group On refers to the phrase “running on clouds”. Investors will soon get the chance to see whether owning its stock is as heavenly. The company, whose backers include tennis star Roger Federer, has filed for a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1858985/000119312521253415/d175570df1.htm#rom175570_7\">New York listing</a>, seeking a reported valuation of up to $8bn.</p> <p>Timing is spot on. Share prices for big brands Nike, Adidas and Puma are at record highs, or near them. High valuations reflect recoveries in the wake of the pandemic. Nike and Adidas sales soared in their respective home regions of the US and Europe in the past quarter. </p> <p>On's sales are almost exclusively in the US and Europe as well. The group targets serious fitness enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium. Would-be investors must be prepared to do the same.</p> <p>Sales at On have kept pace with bigger peers, up 85 per cent in the first six months of this year to SFr315m ($340m). At that pace, an $8bn valuation represents a steep nine times multiple. That compares with three times and five times forward sales multiples for Adidas and Nike respectively.&#xa0;</p> <p>Financial performance suggests a premium of some sort is deserved. On's gross margin was 54 per cent last year. At Adidas it was 49 per cent and at Nike 45 per cent. Higher-margin sales direct to consumer at On accounted for just 38 per cent of total last year, compared with 41 per cent at Adidas. The Swiss group should be able to raise direct sales substantially, given its niche proposition.</p> <p>The territory of Adidas and Nike is the mass “athleisure” market. A steep mooted multiple may pressure On to diversify, bringing it into closer competition with the two giants. The Swiss group is already doing this by producing more clothing and accessories. The risk is that On's premium appeal with running aficionados floats away with its growth ambitions.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is it worth paying more for a specialised pair of running shoes — and for the manufacturer's shares?
