  "text": "<p>Tiffany &amp; Co. dropped a collaboration with streetwear brand Supreme on Thursday in a move to help the 184-year-old jeweler attract more millennial and Gen Z shoppers.</p><p>It's the American luxury brand's latest attempt to appeal to younger customers, and lessen its dependence on engagement rings at a time when fewer people are getting married. It was acquired by LVMH for almost $16 billion in January — when it raised eyebrows by launching a campaign using the slogan “Not Your Mother's Tiffany” that offended some longtime customers.</p><p>https://twitter.com/TiffanyAndCo/status/1457826178182619142?s=20Supreme, which was acquired by VF Corporation in November 2020, has grown its audience relatively quickly since opening its first store in 1994. Supreme is known for a loyal fanbase that lines up for the latest product releases. Supreme originally targeted New York-based skaters, but has since collaborated with more than 50 brands and artists, including Lacoste, Emilio Pucci and Nike NKE, among others.</p><p>Alexandre Arnault, the vice president of product and communications at Tiffany &amp; Co., is also the former CEO of high-end luggage maker Rimowa — where he previously collaborated with Supreme on a $1,600 carry-on.</p><p>And this isn't Tiffany's first streetwear company collab. The company also launched a jewelry collection with Dover Street Market in 2019.</p><p>Tiffany first posted a sneak peek to the seven-piece collection with Supreme on its official Instagram account last weekend. The Tiffany &amp; Co. x Supreme “Return to Tiffany” collection features a heart tag pendant ($450), an oval tag pearl necklace ($300), a star bracelet ($450), heart tag stud earrings ($300), a heart knife keyring ($525), an oval tag keyring ($300) and a t-shirt ($54). The designs, inspired by Tiffany pieces that originally launched in the 1960s, recognize each brand by incorporating Tiffany's iconic heart pendant along with Supreme's box logo.</p><p>https://twitter.com/TiffanyAndCo/status/1457826936479272965?s=20The name also references the original ‘Return to Tiffany' collection from 1966, when the jeweler first began selling key tags featuring the now-famous “Please Return to Tiffany &amp; Co. New York” phrase for $11. Shoppers have to shell out $1,100 for a similar pendant in 2021, however.</p><p>Tiffany &amp; Co. has also tried to attract younger consumers by partnering with celebrities such as Beyonce and Jay Z, Hailey Bieber and Wizards star Kyle Kuzma as brand ambassadors.</p><p>Reps from both companies were not immediately available for comment.</p><p>The collection was released online on Thursday at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S., and Nov. 13 at 11 a.m. JST in Japan.</p>",
