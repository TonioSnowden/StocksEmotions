  "title": "Sports:  Osaka Withdraws  From French Open  ----  By Joshua Robinson",
  "text": "<p>    Paris -- Women's tennis world No. 2 Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open on Monday, dramatically concluding a standoff over her decision not to grant interviews during the tournament, which she had attributed to caring for her mental health. </p><p>   Osaka, the highest-earning female athlete in the world and a winner of four major titles, had touched off the debate over the weekend and is now leaving Paris before even playing the second round. In her exit, she revealed a long-running struggle with depression and cast doubt on the rest of her season. </p><p>   Osaka had already been fined $15,000 by the Roland-Garros organizers for failing to appear in a mandatory news conference after her first-round victory here on Sunday. (She still answered three questions on the court and honored a long-standing agreement with a Japanese broadcaster.) </p><p>   \"I never wanted to be a distraction and I accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer,\" she wrote in a statement posted to her social media accounts. \"More importantly I would never trivialize mental health or use the term lightly. The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the U.S. Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.\" </p><p>   Osaka, who was raised primarily in the U.S. and represents Japan, had stunned the French Open shortly after landing in Paris when she informed organizers that she would not be carrying out her media duties during the tournament, because she \"often felt that people have no regard for athletes' mental health.\" </p><p>   \"I feel for Naomi. I wish I could give her a hug,\" Serena Williams said. \"Like I said, I've been in those positions. We have different personalities. People are different. I'm thick, other people are thin. You just have to let her handle it in the way she wants to and in the best way that she can.\" </p><p>   Though players are contractually obligated to face the press after matches at Grand Slam events, Osaka had indicated she was prepared to pay any fines. But the argument intensified when all four Grand Slam tournaments issued a joint statement threatening her with increased financial penalties and possible suspension. </p><p>   \"First and foremost, we are sorry and sad for Naomi Osaka. The outcome of Naomi Osaka withdrawing from Roland-Garros is unfortunate,\" said French tennis federation president Gilles Moretton, who oversees the tournament. \"We wish her the best and the quickest possible recovery. And we look forward to having Naomi in our tournament next year.\" </p><p>   Osaka has never shied away from standing up to tournament organizers for issues she believes in. During the Western &amp; Southern Open last summer, she forced the suspension of her semifinal match as athletes across several sports protested police violence against Black people following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. Osaka had previously flown to Minneapolis to join marches after the death of George Floyd. </p><p>   And in the U.S. she quickly found support from superstars in other sports. \"You shouldn't ever have to make a decision like this,\" the Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry tweeted, but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don't protect their own.\" </p><p>   In Paris, however, her fellow players have not all been as enthusiastic. While several of her counterparts here have said they could see why she might find speaking to the media immediately after matches to be a taxing exercise, they insisted that the media also played a significant role in making them global celebrities. </p><p>   \"I understand her,\" 13-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal said over the weekend. \"But . . . without the press, without the people who normally are traveling, who are writing the news and achievements that we are having around the world, probably we will not be the athletes that we are today.\" </p><p>   Billie Jean King, a 12-time major winner and activist, echoed the sentiment in a message she posted before Osaka's withdrawal. \"While it's important that everyone has the right to speak their truth, I have always believed that as professional athletes we have a responsibility to make ourselves available to the media,\" she wrote. </p><p>   Osaka, 23, has spent all of her meteoric tennis rise in the public eye. She counts 2.2 million Twitter followers and is reported to have earned over $50 million in prize money and endorsements, including Nike and Nissan. </p><p>   Osaka has not previously expressed concerns about her own mental health so forcefully. In her statement on Monday, she said that the stress and anxiety date as far back as the 2018 U.S. Open. </p><p>   Osaka don't say when she might return to competition, potentially removing one of the stars of the Tokyo Olympics from the Games. </p><p>   \"I'm gonna take some time away from the court now, but when the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans.\" </p><p></p>",
