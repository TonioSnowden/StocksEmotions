  "title": "Sports Court Rejects U.S. Runner's Burrito Story, Upholds Her Four-Year Ban; Shelby Houlihan's failed drug test was unlikely to be caused by tainted pork, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found",
  "text": "<p>In a decision dated last Friday, a panel of three arbitrators for the Swiss-based CAS found that Houlihan didn't satisfy her burden of proof that the rules violation was unintentional, so under the rules, it must be deemed intentional.</p><p>Houlihan was a top contender to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics in the 1500 and 5000 meters before her suspension was revealed days before the start of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in June. Her suspension began in January 2021 and will extend until Houlihan is nearly 32 years old.</p><p>Officials at Nike and the Bowerman Track Club, Houlihan's sponsor and training group, along with Houlihan's agent didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In a highly technical 44-page written decision, which included discussion of the anatomy of pork stomachs and the type of feed given to pigs in the U.S. depending on their age, CAS concluded that Houlihan's hypothesis of how she tested positive was unlikely.</p><p>The panel found it possible, but unlikely, that her burrito included boar offal, also known as entrails and internal organs; and possible, but unlikely, that ingestion of boar offal would have resulted in the urinary concentration of the banned substance found in Houlihan's A- and B- Samples.</p><p>Houlihan \"did not establish on the balance of probabilities that the burrito she partially consumed on 14 December 2020 contained boar offal,\" the panel concluded.</p><p>Under the rules of track and field governing body World Athletics, athletes are responsible for any \"Prohibited Substances or its metabolites or Markers found to be present in their Samples.\"</p><p>The CAS report illustrated the extensive defense provided for Houlihan, the American record holder in the 1500 and 5000 meters and a Nike star, including an analysis of her hair to detect the presence of substances and a polygraph test.</p><p>The panel concluded that neither the hair analysis nor the polygraph result was sufficient for Houlihan to rebut the presumption that the doping violation was intentional.</p><p>Numerous witnesses testified, on behalf of Houlihan, to scientific or procedural aspects of the case. Others spoke about Houlihan's character including Nike athlete and 2016 Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz, who began dating Houlihan in October 2019 and was \"basically inseparable\" from her since then, according to the report.</p><p>Centrowitz \"knows that she would not have taken any prohibited substance because they see each other a lot, meaning he would know if she was doing something suspect, and also because she is, simply, not that type of person,\" the report said.</p><p>Despite its ultimate finding, the report found Houlihan to be \"a credible witness\" and said that she \"brought compelling character witness evidence in support of her defense.\"</p><p>Part of Houlihan's character evidence ironically referred to technology that Nike pioneered: the super-spikes that observers say are helping set records.</p><p>\"Her dream is to win an Olympic gold medal, but only on what she can do naturally,\" the CAS report said. \"She even refused to wear carbon-plated spikes on her shoes because she thought that would give her an unfair advantage. Her coaches begged her to wear the carbon-plated spikes at the World Championships in 2019, but she refused.\"</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Sports Court Rejects U.S. Runner's Burrito Story, Upholds Her Four-Year Ban</p>",
