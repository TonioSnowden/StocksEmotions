  "title": "Nike's Inventory Problem: Passing It Along; The apparel maker's inventory still looks bloated, but it has wholesale customers clamoring for its products",
  "text": "<p>Nike raised its guidance for the full fiscal year, expecting revenue to grow more than 10% on a currency-neutral basis, up from its prior expectation of roughly 5% growth. Investors liked what they heard, sending Nike stock up 12.6% in after-hours trading.</p><p>One major miss in Nike's results was in inventory, which was up 43% last quartercompared with a year earlier, only a slight improvement to the preceding quarter's 44% bloat. Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said on an earnings call on Tuesday that prior-year comparisons aren't fair because inventory was abnormally low last year because of factory closures in Vietnam. Still, Wall Street analysts—who no doubt track that kind of dynamic very closely—had been expecting that bloat to be just 28% above year-earlier levels.</p><p>Luckily for Nike, there are players on the field that will happily take the inventory. Sales through the wholesale channel grew by 30% on a currency-neutral basis, outpacing direct sales growth of 25%. \"Really for the first time in six quarters or so, we can finally supply the [wholesale] channel with the level of demand that we believe is there,\" Mr. Friend said on the call.</p><p>Stronger demand from wholesale channels meant Nike hasn't had to discount as heavily: Gross margins were a better-than-expected 42.9%, a 3-percentage-point decline from a year earlier. Foot Locker stock prices rose 4% in after-hours trading following Nike's call, while Dick's Sporting Goods gained 3%, indicating that investors welcome wholesale partners' sudden access to more Nike products.</p><p>This happy dynamic, though, might not last after Nike sells through the last of its excess merchandise. It has a lofty longer-term goal of reaching operating margins in the high-teens percentage, up from 12.5% last quarter. That will probably require more scoring on its own through direct sales rather than passing to wholesale.</p><p>While Nike is likely to emerge from the excess-inventory problem a winner, its hungry wholesale partners might not.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Nike's Inventory Problem: Passing It Along</p>",
