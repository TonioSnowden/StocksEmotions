  "title": "Famed Running Coach Alberto Salazar Banned for Sexual Misconduct; The U.S. Center for SafeSport's decision against the former Nike-backed elite distance coach has become final",
  "text": "<p>The center had suspended Salazar last summer, but the sanction left the door open for the decision to be overturned by an arbitrator. Arbitrators have ruled against the center in several other high-profile cases. The SafeSport database was updated Wednesday to remove any indication that Salazar's ban was pending arbitration.</p><p>The change makes final a decision against one of American track and field's most celebrated figures, preventing him from participating in sanctioned clubs or events in the U.S.</p><p>Requests for comment to Salazar and his attorney weren't immediately returned.</p><p>Additional details about the sexual misconduct allegations upheld against Salazar were not available on the database. SafeSport doesn't comment on investigations.</p><p>Salazar's initial suspension came in the wake of public reports from several women who ran for the Nike Oregon Project, an elite running group he spearheaded, that he had pressured them to lose weight, sometimes with harmful health effects, and shamed them about their bodies.</p><p>Amy Yoder Begley, a former middle-distance runner with the group, tweeted that she was told she was too fat and \"had the biggest butt on the starting line.\"</p><p>Mary Cain, a young prodigy coached by Salazar, said in a New York Times video that she had been \"emotionally and physically abused\" by a system designed by Salazar. She said she was pressured to lose weight and stopped menstruating for three years.</p><p>Salazar has previously said he had frank discussions with runners about the impact of weight on performance but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight. He denied that any athlete suffered abuse or gender discrimination while running for the Nike Oregon Project.</p><p>At the time of Salazar's suspension, Nike said, \"Alberto is no longer a contracted coach and we shuttered the Oregon project almost 2 years ago.\"</p><p>Salazar, who won the New York City Marathon three times and the Boston Marathon once in the early 1980s, was tapped years later to head the Nike Oregon Project. The selective training group was aimed at reviving U.S. distance running after years of lagging results at international races.</p><p>For two decades, the project largely succeeded. Salazar's runners included marathoner Galen Rupp, who won silver in the 10,000 meters at the 2012 London Games and bronze in the marathon at 2016 Rio, and Matthew Centrowitz, who won the men's 1500 meter gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>But Salazar, who was known for pushing himself to the extreme as a runner, in 2019 was suspended for four years following an extensive investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. An international sports court later upheld the ban.</p><p>Salazar's SafeSport ban extends beyond coaching. When SafeSport initially sanctioned Salazar, a spokesperson for USA Track and Field said that people listed on its Disciplinary Records List may not participate in any capacity in any activity or competition authorized by, organized by, sanctioned by, or under the auspices of USATF; the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee; the national governing bodies recognized by the USOPC; and/or any Local Affiliated Organizations of a national governing body recognized by USATF and/or the USOPC.</p><p>That includes any USATF associations and/or clubs, the spokesperson said.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com</p><p>Famed Running Coach Alberto Salazar Banned for Sexual Misconduct</p>",
