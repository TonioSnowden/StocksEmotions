  "title": "U.S. News:  Avenatti Is Convicted in Fraud Trial  ----  By Corinne Ramey and James Fanelli",
  "text": "<p>   Disgraced celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti  was convicted Friday of stealing nearly $300,000 from his former client and onetime ally, the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. </p><p>   A Manhattan federal jury found Mr. Avenatti, 50, guilty of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. The verdict caps a trial in which Mr. Avenatti unexpectedly benched his lawyers and began representing himself, questioned Ms. Daniels on the witness stand and then declined to present any defense witnesses. </p><p>   Mr. Avenatti clasped his hands and looked at the jury while U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman read the verdict. Judge Furman ordered Mr. Avenatti to report to prison in California on Monday to begin serving his sentence in a separate federal conviction. </p><p>   Outside the courtroom, Mr. Avenatti expressed disappointment. \"I am looking forward to a full adjudication of all of the issues on appeal,\" he said. </p><p>   When asked if he regretted representing himself, he said, \"No, not at all.\" </p><p>   After the verdict, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, \"Rather than advise his clients in their best interests, Avenatti instead used his law degree as a license to steal.\" </p><p>   Clark Brewster, a lawyer for Ms. Daniels, said his client was pleased the justice system worked. \"Stormy is relieved this nightmare is over,\" he said in a statement. </p><p>   It is the second federal criminal conviction of Mr. Avenatti, the television lawyer whose ascent to stardom was tied to his quest to take down former President Donald Trump. In addition to representing Ms. Daniels in her legal battles against the former president, he publicly contemplated a 2020 presidential run. </p><p>   His rise abruptly ended in 2019, when he was indicted in connection with what federal prosecutors said was an attempt to extort more than $20 million from Nike Inc. After a trial in 2020, Mr. Avenatti was convicted of three criminal counts and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. He has appealed that conviction. Last year, in California, he represented himself in a second federal trial that ended in a mistrial. </p><p>   In the latest case, Manhattan federal prosecutors accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing a portion of the advance for Ms. Daniels's memoir, then lying to his onetime client to cover it up. Prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti sent a fake letter from Ms. Daniels to her literary agent. The letter instructed that book payments be sent to an account controlled by Mr. Avenatti. </p><p>   Mr. Avenatti portrayed the dispute as an argument over fees. </p><p></p>",
