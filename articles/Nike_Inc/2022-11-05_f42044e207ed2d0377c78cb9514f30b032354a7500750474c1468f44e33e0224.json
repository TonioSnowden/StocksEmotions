  "title": "Kyrie Irving Is Still a Problem for the Nets and the NBA; The NBA star has been suspended indefinitely after a week of anti-Semitism controversy. Now what?",
  "text": "<p>Irving's belated apology on Instagram came hours after the team took the extraordinary step of escalating the showdown and suspending Irving for at least five games without pay, declaring him \"unfit to be associated\" with the Nets because of his repeated failure to disavow anti-Semitism.</p><p>But his future with the team remains uncertain at a time when his reputation around the league is already toxic, the result of years in which his potential to help a team has been undercut by behavior that hurts it. He has undermined Nets coaches, sacrificed most of a season by refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccination and spun up other controversies by saying, for example, that the Earth is flat.</p><p>In this case, the NBA and the Nets gave Irving several opportunities to distance himself from the film and disavow anti-Semitism, only to watch him double down. The punishment after a week of accommodating and trying to educate him suggested that Irving may finally be approaching the end of the lengthy runway the Nets have afforded him.</p><p>Irving and the team had sought to put the latest controversy behind them by announcing a pair of $500,000 donations in a joint statement with the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday night. But the crisis only widened on Thursday. Silver issued a statement castigating Irving. He responded defiantly minutes later and said he would not back down. The ADL announced that it would refuse to accept the donation it had announced 24 hours earlier.</p><p>Now the question is whether Irving's apology paves a path for him to return to the team. Nets general manager Sean Marks made clear on Friday that Irving's delayed apology wasn't enough to guarantee a speedy return to the court and that he would have to satisfy a series of remedial measures that included meeting with Jewish leaders. The ADL said on Friday that \"there is a lot more to do to undo this damage.\"</p><p>Another shoe dropped on Friday evening, whenNike suspended its lucrative endorsement deal with Irving effectively immediately. The sneaker giant announced that it would no longer release the Kyrie 8 signature shoe, which was scheduled for later this month. Nike had issued a statement at the beginning of the week condemning anti-Semitism without naming Irving.</p><p>\"At Nike, we believe there is no place for hate speech,\" the company said on Friday. \"We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the situation and its impact on everyone.\"</p><p>Nets star Kevin Durant, whose request to be traded months ago was rebuffed by the team, said he trusts Brooklyn to do what is right—then suggested the Nets could have played through the controversy.</p><p>\"I just didn't like anything that went on. I feel like it was all unnecessary,\" Durant said. \"I feel like we could have kept playing basketball and kept quiet as an organization.\" He later clarified his remarks on Twitter. \"I don't condone hate speech or [anti-Semitism], I'm about spreading love always,\" he wrote. \"Our game Unites people and I wanna make sure that's at the forefront.\"</p><p>Irving and Durant signing with the Nets three years ago was a coup for a team that had long been ignored as irrelevant even in its own market. They have been swamped by tumult since then. Irving's mercurial personality and increasingly erratic behavior made him a lightning rod for controversy and turned the Nets into the least reliable team in a town that is home to the Knicks, Mets and Jets.</p><p>There was a time when Irving's public image was so polished that a Pepsi commercial in which he played a white-bearded playground basketball legend named \"Uncle Drew\" was the basis of a feature film.</p><p>But soon Irving's image veered in a different direction. In a series of 2017 interviews, Irving repeatedly said \"the Earth is flat,\" and he later blamed his comments on following YouTube's algorithm into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories. He apologized in 2018 \"to all the science teachers.\"</p><p>Irving, who grew up in New Jersey, where the Nets used to play, came to Brooklyn in 2019 with Durant, who had torn his Achilles tendon and would miss the entire 2019-20 season. Days before the league shut down in the early days of the pandemic, the Nets parted ways with coach Kenny Atkinson, who didn't click with the team's new stars.</p><p>Atkinson was replaced by Steve Nash, the two-time NBA MVP with no coaching experience. Irving undermined his authority before he coached a single game, appearing on Durant's podcast and explaining that he viewed coaching as a collaborative profession.</p><p>\"I don't really see us having a head coach,\" Irving said after Nash was hired.</p><p>Irving's injuries and scientific beliefs frequently kept him sidelined—but he sometimes was simply missing. He missed seven consecutive games in 2021 immediately after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, citing \"family and personal\" stuff and explaining that he just needed \"a pause,\" but he never bothered telling Nash that he would be taking personal time or why.</p><p>Immediately after Irving's mysterious absence, the Nets took the biggest swing in the franchise's history, trading for James Harden and mortgaging their future. Harden stood as an insurance policy to protect the Nets against the risks that Irving presented.</p><p>Durant, Irving and Harden gave the Nets possibly the greatest collection of pure offensive talent the league had ever seen. The team appeared invincible but narrowly lost to the eventual NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks in the 2021 conference semifinals. They haven't won a playoff game since.</p><p>The next season, Irving's refusal to get vaccinated against Covid-19 made him ineligible to play in Nets home games because of a New York City mandate, and one of the world's most prominent workplace vaccine standoffs resulted in the spectacle of the Nets banishing Irving. They didn't want a part-time player, until they did, when they changed their minds and welcomed him back to play in road games during a Covid surge that depleted the Nets roster. Irving was then immediately sidelinedwith Covid. Only when the city's vaccine ordinance was lifted toward the end of the season could he play at home again.</p><p>It was too late for the Nets by then. Harden was so frustrated by the team's constant drama and Irving's unreliability that he engineered a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets were swept in the first round by the Boston Celtics.</p><p>After being beaten by the team that he ditched to sign with Brooklyn, Irving was asked if he planned to exercise his contract option to stay with the Nets. He suggested that he and Durant should have just as much power in running the team as owner Joe Tsai and top executive Sean Marks. \"When I say I'm here with Kev,\" Irving said, \"I think that really entails us managing this franchise together alongside Joe and Sean.\"</p><p>The people actually managing the franchise appeared to disagree. Irving was eligible for a four-year, $187 million extension that the Nets hinted they would offer before the vaccination showdown. They never did. When he scoured the league for potential landing spots, the only teams with enough salary-cap space to afford him were rebuilding franchises, and Irving realized that he would have to take a massive pay cut to sign with a title contender. Instead he triggered his option to stay with the Nets in the final season of his four-year contract, which pays him more than $36 million and makes him a free agent after this season. \"There were options,\" he said. \"But not many.\"</p><p>The never-ending problems seemed to wear on Durant, who demanded a trade from the Nets over the offseason because of the constant uncertainty. \"I want to be in a place that's stable and trying to build a championship culture,\" he later said.</p><p>The Nets have since begun the season 2-6, fired Nash and banished Durant's best teammate.</p><p>When the Nets take the court on Friday night, it will be the 124th game that Irving has missed. He has only played in 111 games since coming to Brooklyn.</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com, Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com</p><p>Kyrie Irving Is Still a Problem for the Nets and the NBA</p>",
