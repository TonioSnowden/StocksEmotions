  "text": "<p>The deal is the latest attempt by the upstart cryptocurrency industry to gain mainstream recognition. Digital currencies and tokens are held by a rising number of institutional investors and retail traders. The U.S. financial regulator approved the launch of the first exchange-traded fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts last month.</p><p>In addition to the National Basketball Association's Lakers, the Staples Center is home to the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings. The 20,000-seat arena is a hub for concerts and a venue for Hollywood stars to be seen both as performers and courtside spectators.</p><p>Crypto.com was founded in 2016 and has more than 2,600 employees, according to its website. It offers cryptocurrency trading, and lets users borrow as much as 10 times their capital to invest in digital currencies. It also provides cryptocurrency-based credit cards and other digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens.</p><p>Other cryptocurrency companies have also targeted sports as a place to introduce themselves to the wider public. The U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX forged a naming-rights deal valued at $135 million for the arena where the NBA's Miami Heat play. It also backed a $20 million advertising campaign featuring football star Tom Brady and his wife, model and businesswoman Gisele Bundchen.</p><p>The Crypto.com price tag appeared to put it in another league. \"This is certainly one of the largest deals I've ever heard of,\" said Irwin Kishner, a lawyer with a focus on sports law at Herrick Feinstein LLP \"It's absolutely a ground-shaking, major transaction.\"</p><p>Crypto.com allows its users to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, as well as lesser-known ones. It is run by Chief Executive Kris Marszalek, a Polish-born and Hong Kong-based entrepreneur. He founded two e-commerce companies, a mobile app and a consumer-electronics business, before stepping into the cryptocurrency industry, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>\"If you want to reach several billions of people, sports is the way to go,\" said Mr. Marszalek in an interview. \"Our objective is to be, in the next three to five years, one of the top 20 consumer brands alongside Nike or Apple.\"</p><p>The company has been on a public-relations push. It hired actor Matt Damon to appear in a commercial in October, adding him to the list of celebrities who have endorsed digital assets, such as Kim Kardashian, Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. The ad's tag line was the proverb \"Fortune favours the brave.\"</p><p>Companies use stadium and arena branding deals to raise their profile.</p>",
