  "text": "<p>   As a golfer, I agree with Daniel Henninger (\"LIV From the U.S. Open,\" Wonder Land, June 16) about golf's infuriating vicissitudes; variability in my tee shots is a 40-year mystery. I do not, however, understand the hand-wringing about golfers wanting a return on their countless hours of practice and hard work. </p><p>   Competitive playing days are finite. Why not spend some on tours offering money for showing up to compete? Aren't Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and others merely repatriating dollars sent to Saudi Arabia for the fossil fuels we decline to pump out of the ground in the U.S.? </p><p>   My sons and I were in the U.S. Open gallery. We cheered heartily for great play, including by those who choose to not play only on the PGA Tour. </p><p>   Stephen Lake </p><p>    Newton, Mass. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    It is best if nobody gets too sanctimonious about the Saudis. Any of those PGA golfers ever heard of slave labor in China's Xinjiang province? It is worth noting that Nike joined other popular brands to oppose a bill before Congress cracking down on imports of goods made by forced laborers in Xinjiang. Check out the dudes at the U.S. Open sporting the swoosh on their shirts, shoes and more. They sure do strike a manly pose. </p><p>   Roger Ruvolo </p><p>    Riverside, Calif. </p><p></p>",
