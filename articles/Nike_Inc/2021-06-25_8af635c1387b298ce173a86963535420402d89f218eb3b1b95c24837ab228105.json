  "text": "<p>Consumers are taking Nike's “Just Do It” slogan to heart. Vaccine rollouts and resurgent economies have encouraged a spending spree. Sales at the athletic-wear giant nearly <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FY21-Q4-Combined-NIKE-Press-Release-Schedules-FINAL-(002)-(1).pdf\">doubled to $12.4bn</a> in its fiscal fourth quarter. Net income surged to $1.5bn. An upbeat outlook has added to the buying frenzy. Nike shares jumped 14 per cent on Friday morning, hitting a new high.</p> <p>The market reaction is not just a response to the post-pandemic sales jump. Results show that the company's decision to step away from third party brick-and-mortar retailers in favour of selling directly to consumers online has paid off. Sales at Nike Direct, its direct-to-consumer channel, rose<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5757bd4-5128-4e21-995f-38f774e2f004#post-e8080184-dd15-4a5a-b0cd-1cdde8a24a28\"> 73 per cent </a>during the quarter. Cutting down on wholesale distribution has also proved more lucrative, with gross margins rising 850 basis points to nearly 46 per cent.</p> <p>Nike did hit a hurdle during the past quarter. Sales in China grew less than expected. The company has been the target of boycott campaigns over its stance on the use of forced labour in cotton production in the Xinjiang region. </p> <p>The impact of these look serious. But Chinese consumer boycotts of foreign brands tend to be short lived. Sales of Japanese cars in China took a hit in 2012 after a territorial dispute set off a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in the country. But they bounced back a couple of months later.</p> <p>This otherwise healthy quarter comes at a dear price for investors, however. Shares trades at about 30 times forward earnings, well above the 10-year average. Despite a progressive dividend policy, the yield of under 1 per cent hardly allures. But shareholders do appear to approve of Nike's strong brand recognition plus its new business model. The focus on selling directly to consumer means that it can command a full price for its shares as well as for its sneakers.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
