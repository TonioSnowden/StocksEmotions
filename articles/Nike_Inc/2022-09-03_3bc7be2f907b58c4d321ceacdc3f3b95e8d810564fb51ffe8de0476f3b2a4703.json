  "text": "<p>\"We had to succumb to the Serena influence,\" said Bill, 44, a mechatronics engineer, who managed to catch the winner of 23 Grand Slam titles in action before she was eliminated from the Open on Friday night.</p><p>Avan, 64, from Kansas, who declined to give his last name, agreed that \"it's worth it — it's exciting!\"</p><p>And he managed to save some dough by enduring a long layover in St. Louis while flying to his first U.S. Open.</p><p>\"As much as I played tennis, I have never been to the U.S. Open,\" he added. \"There's shops, stores, eating places — it's just an all-around experience, really.\"</p><p>And nothing about it comes cheap.</p><p>After tennis legendSerena Williams suggested that this would likely be her last professional tennis tournament last month, ticket prices skyrocketed more than 87% to hit $568 on average, which is 117% more expensive than last year, and nearly double 2011 prices, according toTicketIQ data. (Williams was even sporting 400 diamonds on her custom Nike sneakers this week.)</p><p>Even the players are competing for a record-setting $60.1 million in total prize money.</p><p>Inflation currently remaining near a 40-year high has also certainly jacked up the cost of airfare and hotel accommodations to attend the two-week tournament that draws hundreds of thousands of spectators to Queens, New York (which is already an expensive metro area), not to mention on-site concessions like the signature Honey Deuce cocktail (now an eye-watering $22, which is 10% more than last year) and $16 chicken tenders.</p><p>\"The food's definitely gone up, but it's gotten better,\" said Vi Ballard, 70, from Palos Verdes, California, who's been to the U.S. Open more than 15 times.</p><p>\"Everything's expensive,\" she added.</p><p>But the rumors that the first week of the Open could be Williams' swan song certainly played a part in ticket price hikes. Tickets to her match last Monday were averaging almost $1,000 on the secondary market.</p><p>Yet spectators who spoke with MarketWatch said they weren't seriously tempted to cash in their seats on the resale market, despite the uncertain economic conditions surroundinginflation and apossible recession. Indeed, a record audience of almost 30,000 people — including Tiger Woods, Spike Lee and Zendaya — packed the stands on Wednesday night to watch Williams beat No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.</p><p>See also:Serena Williams wins again at U.S. Open — but, really, can she ever lose?</p><p>\"You could sell [your tickets] and make so much money,\" mused Gwen, a first-time U.S. Open visitor from California who declined to give her last name. She and a friend snagged their tickets before Williams announced she's evolving away from tennis, so they could have sold them for a tidy profit. But Gwen said getting away from daily stressors and seeing history in action were too big a draw.</p><p>\"There's so much energy,\" she said.</p><p>Some guests made room in their budgets for the U.S. Open spectacle with hard work and clever budget hacks. Amy Biau, a marketing consultant from New York City, has been coming to the Open since 2005. She used credit card rewards points to buy her tickets this year, and she's given herself a hard $50 budget for buying stuff.</p><p>\"I looked at a shirt that was beautiful, but it was $98,\" said Blau, who gave her age as \"not 70, and not 80.\" And she might be out of luck for an affordable memento, as even online, adult-sized U.S. Open merch runs $36 and up.</p><p>But others like the Whitts from Houston are fully invested in the experience.</p><p>\"We've spent the last nine months basically putting money away for the U.S. Open,\" said Miranda, who does operations for an oil and gas company. She said they squirreled away money \"out of every paycheck.\"</p><p>They've cut costs where they can, such as scoring their tickets in early 2022, when seats were still under $200 apiece. And they're staying in a Manhattan timeshare owned by Miranda's parents to help cut down on accommodation costs.</p><p>Their biggest budget hack has been refilling their water bottles at the site's hydration stations, rather than spending $8 per bottle of Evian.</p><p>But they couldn't resist a $22 Honey Deuce (roughly the cost of three Evians at the Open. \"We had to get one just to try it,\" Miranda said.</p><p>Inflation can't keep U.S. Open fans from Serena Williams and $22 cocktails</p>",
