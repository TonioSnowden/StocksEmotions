  "title": "Is Kanye West good for Gap?",
  "text": "<p>In 2020, Kanye West, the globally recognisable and protean entertainer, announced a 10-year deal with the all-American retailer Gap. It was an unlikely tie-up. West's sellout Adidas sneakers and limited-edition collections of luxury streetwear had previously cost his fans and followers hundreds or thousands of dollars to buy, but Gap could offer a more attainable price point and wider distribution. For West, it was a dream realised: he had spoken of wanting to work with Gap for years.</p> <p>In terms of brand association, signing up West — who created a coveted line with Adidas that reportedly reached $1.7bn in annual revenue in six years — was a coup for Gap. It marked its boldest attempt yet to regain relevance with younger shoppers after close to two decades of overall declining sales, store closures and excessive discounting.</p> <p>But 18 months into the partnership, with only two products released, many are left wondering: can Gap still reap benefits from linking up with the controversial celebrity?</p> <p>The slow rollout has frustrated Gap, according to two sources with knowledge of the business, even as the brand moved its support teams for West from Cody, Wyoming to Atlanta and Los Angeles over the past year to keep up with the musician's busy schedule. The first Yeezy Gap pieces were meant to launch in 2020, followed by a full range of apparel and accessories sometime in 2021.</p> <p>Instead, Yeezy Gap released its first item, a puffer jacket, in June 2021, followed by a hooded sweatshirt in September 2021, each in multiple colour options. Both have been supplemented by additional “drops” of the same styles, typically with several weeks of estimated delivery. </p> <p>Several factors have slowed down the schedule, according to the two sources: West, whose creative output can be impulsive and who has the final say on the design of his Gap line, has struggled to keep his products under $100 (his own stipulation, not Gap's) while maintaining the quality he wants. West has also cycled through collaborators, according to one source, including British-based designer Mowalola Ogunlesi (initially the Yeezy Gap's design director), who exited last year.</p> <p>Representatives for Gap and West declined to comment. In December, Gap president and chief executive Mark Breitbard said to Glossy, “The energy around this [Yeezy] partnership is great for the brand and the company, so we're excited to be working with him.”</p> <p>Yeezy Gap's first releases have sold quickly and garnered ample headlines, but it's unclear whether they are having a “halo effect” on the overall Gap brand. The most recent hoodie release in January arrived with the collaboration's first commercial, a dark and dystopian music video that had bore little connection to Gap's history of family-friendly marketing.</p> <p>“It felt very disconnected in terms of some of those kinds of partnerships, alliances that we see going now,” says Wendy Liebmann, founder of New York-based retail strategy consultancy WSL Strategic Retail.</p> <p>Gap planned on more than good PR buzz from its tie-up with West: Yeezy Gap was expected to generate more than $150m in revenue in 2022, according to a bank document valuing West's deals and reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/kanye-west-and-gap-have-billion-dollar-ambitions-for-yeezy-deal\">Bloomberg</a> a year ago. The brand projected Yeezy Gap could become a billion-dollar brand by as early as 2023.</p> <p>Gap is hoping for a similar effect to the one West had on Adidas. In 2013, the German sportswear giant started a highly coveted, limited-edition sneaker line with West that steadily grew into a $1.7bn business as of 2020, according to Bloomberg. The collaboration was the highest-profile of a suite of collaborations that helped Adidas court American shoppers and gain on Nike.</p> <p>But from a commercial perspective, ready-to-wear has long proven to be a trickier proposition for West. He presented several apparel collections in New York and Paris fashion weeks over the past decade, ranging from higher end designer wares to sportswear. While fashion industry reaction became more positive over time, and his aesthetic approach went on to influence mainstream trends, few collections were ever made commercially available. Meanwhile, West's high-concept touring merchandise of T-shirts and other basics drew scores of shoppers with each album release.</p> <p>Now, West's latest merch collaborator, Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia, is joining his work at Gap. The brand announced in January that the Kering-owned French luxury house will collaborate on a collection for Yeezy Gap that is expected to come to market in June.</p> <p>For fashion followers, the collaboration-within-a-collaboration will be highly anticipated: West continues to have an outsized influence on streetwear trends, while Gvasalia is widely recognised as one of the most innovative designers working today.</p> <p>But Gap remains the least interesting player in this tie-up. The brand generated net sales of approximately $2.9bn in the first three quarters of its 2021 fiscal year, down 12 per cent from the same period in 2019, as it closed stores and invested in ecommerce.</p> <p>And while news of the West collaboration helped spike Gap Inc's stock price in 2020 by as much as 40 per cent in the hours after it broke, the price has since lost about 80 per cent of the gains it made over most of the first year. Last week, Morgan Stanley downgraded Gap to “underweight,” citing lower margin expectations for the year ahead. </p> <p>“It's a win from the PR side and a question mark on the commercial side,” says Neil Saunders, managing director at consulting firm GlobalData. “It doesn't have the coherence of being a true commercial operation, [but] that might be completely deliberate.”</p> <p>Little has been revealed publicly about Yeezy Gap's sales performance so far. Gap Inc chief executive officer Sonia Syngal said on an earnings call last year that 75 per cent of Yeezy Gap shoppers who pre-ordered the first launch of the puffer jacket were new to the brand. The subsequent hoodie attracted a similar level of new customers, and delivered “the most sales by an item in a single day in Gap.com history,” Syngal said in November. “This partnership is unlocking the power of a new audience for Gap: Gen-Z plus Gen-X men from diverse backgrounds,” she said.</p> <p>But Syngal did not say how many of those shoppers also bought from the rest of Gap's assortment, nor how many returned after the initial purchase. Some of Yeezy Gap shoppers may never even visit Gap.com: the most recent drop of the sweatshirt in January was sold through a separate website, YeezyGap.com, following a similar structure with his Adidas collections.</p> <p>But Gap's customer loyalty did increase in 2021, according to marketing research firm Brand Keys, jumping to fifth overall in the apparel category after years of hovering between 10th and 20th. West's association could be a factor: North American shoppers cited “unique merchandise” and “brand buzz” as positive factors. </p> <p>Gap has made other efforts to connect with a new generation of shoppers — like releasing a logo hoodie after it went viral on TikTok — but they have yet to make a significant impact with Gen Z. The brand failed to make the list of teens' top 10 favourite clothing brands on Piper Sandler's most recent twice yearly survey — where Gap last took the number 1 spot in 2001 — consistently appearing, instead, on the list of brands no longer worn by respondents.</p> <p>West has the kind of influence to help Gap shift its public perception, but he is also known for courting controversy. In the months after the deal with Gap was announced, he orchestrated a disorganised campaign for US president. He also suggested he would hold back Yeezy Gap releases if he was not appointed to its board of directors, citing “black board seats matter” in a post on Twitter.</p> <p>West also said he would set up a domestic manufacturing facility for his collaborations for Gap and Adidas in Wyoming where he bought ranches and several commercial properties. Only a handful of locals were ever employed by the operation, according to local newspaper <a href=\"https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/kanye-era-comes-to-end-in-cody/article_04a7982e-6a1f-5c85-bcf1-81cfac04b7de.html\">Casper Star Tribune</a>, and West put most of his commercial properties in the state up for sale by the end of 2021. This was all while releasing a new album, performing at concert-style listening events and wading through a high-profile divorce.</p> <p>Gap never commented on these headlines, beyond assuring analysts that West was “focused” on the line during an earnings call in March 2021.</p> <p>Balenciaga could be the stabilising force Yeezy Gap needs to deliver a more robust range that could turn into the billion-dollar brand of Gap's dreams. But even then, the question for Gap will remain as to how much that buzz translates into an interest in Gap's jeans and T-shirts and its more than 500 stores.</p> <p>“[So far] it really has very little to do with Gap at all,” says Saunders. “Kanye could have done this on his own and it would have been just as successful.”</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Chantal Fernandez 2022 'Is Kanye West good for Gap?'
