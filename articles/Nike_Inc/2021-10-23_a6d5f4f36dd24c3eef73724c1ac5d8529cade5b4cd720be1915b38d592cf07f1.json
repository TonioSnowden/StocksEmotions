  "text": "<p>As a young man in the late 1950s and early 1960s, David Kennedy was partial to Miles Davis, abstract art and Native American culture. He was, as he put it later, \"scared to death of being ordinary.\"</p><p>So his early jobs at advertising agencies in Chicago, as a huckster of mainstream merchandise, were an uncomfortable fit. Unwilling to be categorized as an ad man, he sometimes told people he worked in graphic design.</p><p>With five children to support, however, dropping out wasn't an option. Instead, he moved West, to Portland, Ore., in 1979 to work in an office of McCann-Erickson. Three years later, he and a like-minded colleague, Dan Wieden, set up their own Portland-based firm, Wieden+Kennedy, initially in an office furnished with a borrowed card table. Doing ads for Nike Inc., including the \"Just Do It\" campaigns, helped transform their firm from a boutique into a creative powerhouse, now with about 1,400 employees and offices overseas.</p><p>A 1985 ad for Honda scooters -- featuring a swirling collage of New York street life along with Lou Reed and his song \"Walk on the Wild Side\" -- established the firm's reputation for artistic sophistication. Making ads could be kind of hip after all.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, who retired in his mid-50s to make metal sculptures, died Oct. 10 of heart failure. He was 82.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
