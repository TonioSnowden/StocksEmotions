  "text": "<p>Friday's session was a quiet end to an eventful week. Markets were whipsawed in recent days by fears that the possible collapse of Evergrande could spill over into global markets and add to an already darkening outlook for global growth.</p><p>Investors who own Evergrande's U.S. dollar bonds hadn't received an interest payment by a Thursday deadline, raising concerns about a potential default. Evergrande shares fell 11.6% Friday in Hong Kong, and are down more than 84% this year.</p><p>\"It is one of the largest companies in the second-largest economy in the world and if something pulls down Chinese growth it is going to pull down global growth,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.</p><p>Such fears sparked a wave of selling at the start of the week, but the market recovered its footing Wednesday as investors seized the opportunity to buy the dip. The Federal Reserve also helped boost confidence that day when it said the U.S. economy had made enough progress for the central bank to start dialing back its stimulus efforts as soon as November. The Dow rallied a combined 2.5% on Wednesday and Thursday, in its biggest two-day gain since March.</p><p>The Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended Friday with weekly gains of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Nasdaq was little changed for the week.</p><p>The week's rebound showed how many investors feel they have no alternative but to keep piling money into stocks, with bonds unattractive due to low interest rates, said Phillip Toews, chief executive of Toews Asset Management. \"If you want to have gains anywhere, the stock market is the place to be,\" he said.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies were also in the spotlight this week as the tremors from China and mounting pressure from regulators around the world jolted digital-asset markets. On Friday, crypto prices fell after China's central bank declared all cryptocurrency-related transactions illegal. Bitcoin fell 3.8% from its 5 p.m. ET level Thursday to about $43,000, according to CoinDesk. Ether slumped more than 6%. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global fell $5.68, or 2.4%, to $231.82.</p><p>Meredith Corp. surged $11.41, or 25%, to $56.30 per share on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the People Magazine publisher was in talks to be acquired by Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp.</p><p>Shares of Nike tumbled $9.99, or 6.3%, to $149.59 after the sportswear giant lowered revenue guidance, citing supply-chain disruptions in Asia.</p><p>In commodity markets, oil prices rose to a nearly three-year high amid continued supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and strong energy demand. Front-month futures on benchmark Brent crude oil rose 1.1% to $78.09 per barrel, their highest settle value since October 2018.</p><p>Government bond yields have climbed this week after several central banks—including the Fed—signaled they were on the path toward removing pandemic-era stimulus measures. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.459% on Friday, its highest settle value since July, from 1.408% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Data released Friday showed that U.S. new-home sales grew in August for the second consecutive month, coming in slightly higher than economists' forecasts.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.9%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index weakened 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com</p><p>Dow, S&amp;P 500 Edge Higher After Evergrande Payment Deadline Passes</p>",
