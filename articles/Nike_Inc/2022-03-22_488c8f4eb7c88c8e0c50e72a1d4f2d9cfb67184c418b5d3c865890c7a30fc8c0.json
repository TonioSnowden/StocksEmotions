  "text": "<p>After releasing a video on social media of a throwing session, Kaepernick spent the past week barnstorming across the country working out with NFL players. He threw with Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett in Arizona on March 14 before conducting workouts in Houston on March 15, Dallas the next day and Atlanta on March 18.</p><p>The people who have participated in the workouts praise his fitness and abilities. NFL teams are frantically searching for quarterbacks. The question: Will any team give the 34-year-old quarterback a shot?</p><p>It's a question that ties NFL executives in knots. \"Does that guy deserve a second shot? I think he does, somewhere,\" said Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, whose team just traded Russell Wilson and needs a quarterback. \"I don't know if it's here. I don't know where it is. I don't know if it's even in football.\"</p><p>The people who have seen Kaepernick's workout over the past week have a more bullish view.</p><p>\"He could play for any one of these 32 teams. He looked great,\" says Rischad Whitfield, a trainer who oversaw one of his sessions last week that included several current NFL receivers. \"Five years? You'd think he just finished playing football during the regular season in the NFL.\"</p><p>A return is reasonably a longshot. During Kaepernick's last season with the San Francisco 49ers, in 2016, he started protests during the national anthem to call attention to racial injustices such as police brutality. The ramifications of that movement played out for years -- for both the NFL and the quarterback.</p><p>Kaepernick has gone unsigned ever since and filed a since-settled grievance, against the league and all 32 teams, that alleged he was effectively blackballed because of his outspoken political views. Meanwhile, as some players continued to protest throughout the sport, then-President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the demonstrations as unpatriotic while assailing the NFL for allowing them to continue.</p><p>The barbs dragged the country's most popular sport into a direct feud with the sitting president while dividing fans over the politically polarizing issue. At points, players knelt en masse in a direct rebuke of Trump's commentary and the league instituted -- and quickly aborted -- a policy change that would require players to stand or remain in the locker room for the anthem.</p><p>Yet the NFL in 2022 exists in a different landscape than years past. Trump is no longer president. And the league has also tacked to the left on social issues. In a stunning 2020 video, while protests against police brutality swept the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing, commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was wrong to not have listened to players earlier on these topics and encouraged peaceful protest. \"End Racism\" has been stenciled into the back of the end zones of NFL stadiums for the past two years.</p><p>Also of note: former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores, who recently sued the NFL and three teams for allegations of racial discrimination in the league's hiring practices, nonetheless got a job as an assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers after filing his suit.</p><p>Against that backdrop, Kaepernick publicized his renewed push to get signed. He wrote on Twitter that he has been working out for the past five years in case an opportunity arose. But he added he missed throwing to \"professional route runners.\"</p><p>\"Let's do it bro!\" Lockett tweeted 10 minutes later. \"Me and my brother will come run routes for you.\"</p><p>That led to a workout in Scottsdale, Ariz., with Lockett and his brother Sterling, a receiver at Kansas State. By the next day, he had posted a seven-minute video to YouTube of the session, which included a ball that traveled 55 yards in the air and hit his target in stride. (His live stream of the session also attracted attention from big names, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who commented: \"Let's hear it for @kaepernick7 we need that arm in NY.\")</p><p>Lockett, afterward, endorsed Kaepernick's abilities. \"That man Kap is ready!!\" he tweeted.</p><p>On March 15, he landed in Houston, where he conducted another workout overseen by Whitfield, who's nicknamed the \"Footwork King\" and trains stars such as Odell Beckham Jr. Whitfield says a number of current NFL receivers participated, including the Philadelphia Eagles' Greg Ward and the Buffalo Bills' Marquez Stevenson.</p><p>This tour was far different than Kaepernick's last high-profile workout in 2019. Amid gripes that no NFL team had even offered him a workout since he and the 49ers split, the NFL attempted to stage one at the Atlanta Falcons' training facility. Then it fell apart at the last second over the language in a waiver Kaepernick was reluctant to sign. Instead, he staged his own workout at a nearby school while Nike -- which is partners with both the league and Kaepernick -- was caught in the middle of the firefight.</p><p>\"Colin is a free agent and eligible to sign with any club,\" an NFL spokesman said.</p>",
