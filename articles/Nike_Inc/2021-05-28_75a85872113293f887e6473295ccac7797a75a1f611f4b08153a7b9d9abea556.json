  "title": "U.S. News:  How Neymar Became Soccer's Most Expensive Star  ----  By Joshua Robinson",
  "text": "<p>   PARIS -- Ever since Neymar was a spiky-haired teenager in southern Brazil, large swaths of the soccer economy have been invested in making him a superstar. </p><p>   He was the prodigy who shot to fame with Santos, before two of the richest clubs on the planet spent hundreds of millions of dollars to secure his services. He had a major Nike endorsement that put his face on billboards around the planet. And he was the face of Brazil's home World Cup in 2014 and the Rio Olympics two years later. </p><p>   But in 2020, Nike parted with its onetime golden boy. </p><p>   Soccer clubs, sponsors, and officials around the world long viewed Neymar as heir apparent to the game's reigning kings, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. That much was confirmed in 2017 as Neymar became the most expensive player in soccer history. Paris Saint-Germain had paid FC Barcelona about $260 million for his contract, more than doubling the previous world transfer record. </p><p>   Yet for all the hype that has surrounded him, Neymar, now 29, has never quite cleared the high bar that was set for him. </p><p>   The kid who had inherited Brazil's No. 10 jersey from Pele entered the 2014 World Cup known as a paradox: his status as a dazzling playmaker was matched only by his reputation for diving to deceive referees at the slightest contact. Neymar's tournament was cut short when he sustained a fracture in his back in the quarterfinals. The only silver lining: The injury saved him from playing on one of Brazil's most humiliating nights, the 7-1 defeat to Germany in the semis. </p><p>   \"We suffer pressure in all of the things we do,\" Neymar wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal in 2014. \"It's normal in life, but if you're an athlete, this pressure is bigger because you are an example for many people. I suffer pressure since I decided to become a player, but it's a pleasure for me to play a World Cup in my country to my people.\" </p><p>   Neymar spent the next few years of his career rebuilding his image. He won the 2014-15 Champions League with Barcelona and led a national catharsis for Brazil at the 2016 Olympics as the home team took the men's soccer gold medal in a bouncing Maracana Stadium. By then, his profile was global enough that sponsors were trotting him out courtside at NBA games and setting him up to take batting practice with the New York Mets, which he did on a Nike publicity tour in 2016. </p><p>   More than being one of the most famous players in the world's favorite sport, Neymar had something Messi and Ronaldo didn't. Just a few years younger, he was a star for the social media age. With 151 million Instagram followers, he counts 66 million more than LeBron James. He also has a devoted following on the streaming platform Twitch, where fans log on in droves to watch Neymar play videogames. </p><p>   But on the pitch, Neymar still felt he was in Messi's shadow. Five years after joining Barcelona, his first club in Europe, for $117 million, he made a stunning leap from Barcelona to Paris in 2017. He felt the time was right to take center stage. And in Paris Saint-Germain, Neymar found a willing partner: a Nike-sponsored club whose ambition is fueled by the bottomless resources of Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund. </p><p>   \"With such a phenomenal player, you can't tell him there is already a team there and that he will have to adapt,\" PSG's manager at the time, Unai Emery, told France Football. \"You have to create the team for him. Otherwise, he wouldn't come -- that's for sure.\" </p><p>   Not only was Neymar the sport's most expensive player. He was also now at the center of a project that touched the pinnacle of world soccer, global branding, and the geopolitics of the Gulf. Except that the game's top prizes continued to elude him. He hasn't won the Champions League since leaving Barcelona, nor has he cracked the top three in FIFA's world player of the year voting since 2017. </p><p></p>",
