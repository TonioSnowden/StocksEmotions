  "title": "New ETFs Will Track Individual Stocks  ----  By Karen Langley",
  "text": "<p>   Investors in U.S. markets have a new way to supersize bets on high-profile stocks. Regulators are suggesting they do so with care. </p><p>   AXS Investments on Thursday launched a set of exchange-traded funds tied to shares of PayPal Holdings Inc., Nike Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Nvidia Corp. that are designed to amplify their daily performance, or the inverse of that performance. Another fund seeks to produce the inverse of Tesla Inc.'s daily return, without using leverage. </p><p>   AXS Investments says the funds are meant to be used as short-term trading vehicles and aren't appropriate for investors who don't plan to actively manage their portfolios. </p><p>   Greg Bassuk, chief executive at AXS Investments, said his firm's new funds would be the first single-stock ETFs to trade in the U.S., though similar products were already on the market in Europe. The funds will use derivative contracts to produce the leveraged or inverse of the daily returns of underlying stocks. </p><p>   \"We think they're going to be great tools for traders,\" he said. \"It's a magnified exposure for individual stocks and definitely geared towards educated, sophisticated traders who are able to withstand higher levels of risk.\" </p><p>   The arrival of the single-stock ETFs is another milestone for an industry best known for funds that passively track the performance of stock indexes like the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   The ETF landscape has expanded to include funds focused on bonds and commodities, as well as actively managed stock-picking funds. It also has grown to include high-risk products: Investors already have shown an appetite for funds that apply leverage and inverse strategies to stock indexes. </p><p>   U.S. regulators cautioned this week that the new type of fund carries risks. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said that she has previously expressed concern about leveraged and inverse ETFs and worries the single-stock versions could pose an even greater risk to investors. </p><p>   Daily rebalancing of the ETFs, together with the effects of compounding, mean that returns over multiple days could be very different than investors would expect based on the performance of the underlying stock, she said. </p><p>   \"It would likely be challenging for an investment professional to recommend such a product to a retail investor while also honoring his or her fiduciary obligations,\" she said. </p><p>   Lori Schock, director of the office of investor education and advocacy at the SEC, warned that the new funds aren't right for every investor. In addition to the risks of holding on for longer periods to investment products aimed at short-term returns, the single-stock ETFs don't carry the benefit of diversification present in other funds, she said. </p><p>   Exchange-traded products based on single securities have been on the market in Europe for several years. </p><p>   GraniteShares, which is in the process of trying to launch leveraged and inverse single-stock ETFs in the U.S., has leveraged single-stock products trading on exchanges in Europe, said founder and Chief Executive Will Rhind. </p><p>   Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, an ETF data and analytics company, said the single-stock ETFs could be used during earnings season by investors who want to bet on how a stock will move after a company reports results. </p><p>   \"If used correctly, these products can be powerful, but if used incorrectly they can be harmful,\" he said. \"Much like power tools can be in the hands of the knowing professional who's using this for the right purpose.\" </p><p></p>",
