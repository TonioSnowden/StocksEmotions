  "text": "<p>Mr. Crane and his teammates played water polo together in high school and college. They all live in California -- he is based in Monte Sereno -- and three have homes around Lake Tahoe. Mr. Crane, the chief executive of a regional real-estate company in Silicon Valley, says they lost touch for a decade because of career and family needs, but the race reconnected them in their 40s. The men have been competing for more than 10 years.</p><p>At 57, Mr. Crane is the oldest, and jokes that the collective age of their team, the Thrashers, is over 330 years old.</p><p>Set at 6,200 feet, Lake Tahoe's high elevation makes the race challenging even for lifelong swimmers like Mr. Crane and his friends. Water temperatures hover between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit and race rules forbid wetsuits. And while some men open-water swim for training, Mr. Crane sticks to a pool.</p><p>\"The combination of thin air and cold water left me sucking wind,\" he says. \"I promised myself I'd never come to a race without training again.\"</p><p>He and his friends started training in their respective pools or the ocean around March or April for the July 16 race. \"We aren't fast, but we have fun,\" he says. It typically takes them at least five hours to finish. The winning time is usually under three hours and 30 minutes.</p><p>\"Our age puts us in the last start zone, which hurts our pride, but during the course of the race, we try to reel in swimmers from the earlier start times,\" says teammate Michael Keane, who is 56 and lives in Santa Cruz, Calif.</p><p>While one teammate swims, the others listen to music and catch up on life. \"As much as it's a race, it's also a day we relive our youth and reconnect,\" Mr. Crane says. \"We've thought about bringing out beer, but we all want to make it to the other side.\"</p><p>The Workout</p><p>Mr. Crane rises at 5 a.m. during the week and sleeps until 7 a.m. on weekends. Mornings begin with 10 minutes of stretching, followed by 20 minutes of meditation before he heads to the gym.</p><p>He swims three days a week with a U.S. Masters Swimming group. After an 800-yard warm-up, the group does drills that work on different strokes and kicking techniques. Mr. Crane estimates he swims around 2 miles each workout. \"I know if I can swim for an hour in the pool, I can complete the race no matter the water conditions,\" he says.</p><p>Three years ago, Mr. Crane injured his shoulder in a mountain-bike accident. He assumed he would swim with pain for the rest of his life. Last year, he started working with a personal trainer who has helped him return to mostly pain-free swimming. They meet twice a week for an hourlong session.</p><p>Tuesday upper-body exercises might include dumbbell biceps curls, dumbbell front raises, a cable chest press, rows and an Olympic power movement such as a power clean, in which a barbell is hoisted rapidly to shoulder height. Thursday lower-body workouts often entail Romanian deadlifts, lunges in three different planes, calf raises and barbell thrusters -- squats in which a weighted bar is thrust from chest height above the head as the person stands up. He concludes with a core-strength circuit.</p><p>The Diet</p><p>Creature of habit: He often eats the same meals -- oatmeal and fruit in the morning and a salad topped with a protein for both lunch and dinner.</p><p>Salad creativity: He and his wife's go-to dinner salad is topped with cucumbers, onions, garbanzo or kidney beans, avocado and grilled chicken. Their splurge is adding crumbles of feta cheese. They use olive oil and vinegar for dressing.</p><p>Treat: \"I've never met an ice-cream flavor I didn't enjoy,\" he says. \"When I'm trying to be good, I order frozen yogurt.\" He jokes that a glass of red wine with dinner is often his motivation to swim.</p><p>Essential Gear</p><p>For the pool: Speedo Jammer Powerflex Eco swimsuit ($50), Speedo Vanquisher 2.0 mirrored goggles ($25), TYR Burner fins 2.0 ($50), Speedo pull buoy ($15)</p><p>For the gym: Brooks sneakers and Nike or Lululemon apparel</p><p>Playlist</p><p>\"Old-school bands like U2, the Eagles and Tom Petty.\"</p>",
