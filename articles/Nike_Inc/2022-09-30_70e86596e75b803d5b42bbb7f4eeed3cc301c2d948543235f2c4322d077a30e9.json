  "title": "Business News: Nike Sees Inventories Jump, Boosts Discounts",
  "text": "<p>Shares of Nike tumbled about 10% in late trading following its quarterly report.</p><p>For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Nike reported revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% from a year earlier. Earnings fell 22% to $1.5 billion, but the results were largely in line with analysts' expectations.</p><p>The results are the latest sign of how rapidly retailers and manufacturers of everything from fertilizer to furniture have found themselves with a surplus of goods after two years where they scrambled to have enough to sell during the pandemic.</p><p>\"We are taking decisive action to clear excess inventory,\" Nike finance chief Matthew Friend said during a call Thursday to discuss the latest results.</p><p>Mr. Friend said Nike had started increasing discounts during the summer months and that inventory in North America had peaked during the quarter. For the fall quarter, the company will work aggressively to liquidate excess goods and plans to tighten the amount of product it buys, he said.</p><p>He said most of the inventory pile-up is apparel that arrived late for each of the seasons in previous quarters in North America. Inventory levels would start to normalize during the fall quarter but some liquidation is expected in the winter quarter, he said.</p><p>For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Nike reported revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% compared with a year earlier. Earnings fell 22% to $1.5 billion but the results were largely in line with analysts' expectations.</p><p>As the holiday shopping season nears with uncertainty around consumer retail spending, Nike is still recovering from production delays and longer transit times creating bottlenecks in its business. Nike executives said inventory in North America was up 65% from a year ago and the amount of inventory in transit was up 85% from a year ago.</p><p>Executives said they are betting on strong consumer demand and expect revenue in the fall quarter to rise more than 10% despite currency swings. Gross margins will continue to decline as the company discounts more products. It will have higher markdowns in its own stores and apps than through its wholesale partners, executives said.</p><p>In June, Nike forecast that sales would increase by a low single-digit percentage this fiscal year, when setting aside currency fluctuations. On that basis, sales rose 10% in the August quarter.</p><p>\"It really all depends on the consumer environment and how much they spend, as we get further into the holiday season,\" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernandez.</p><p>Before the report, Nike's share price had lost 42% on the year, compared with a 24% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index. The stock was down an additional 10% to $85.90 in late trading.</p><p>The Beaverton, Ore., company has said it would work with its wholesale partners to discount merchandise to help clear excess inventory. Retailers like Foot Locker Inc., Hibbett Inc. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., which all carry Nike merchandise, said recently that they have received long-awaited inventory from vendors but also noted stiff competition on price in the marketplace.</p>",
