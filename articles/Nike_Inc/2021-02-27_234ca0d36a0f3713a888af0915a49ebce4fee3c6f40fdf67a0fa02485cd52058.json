  "title": "Sports:  A World Record With Low-Tech Shoes  ----  By Rachel Bachman",
  "text": "<p>   American sprinter Grant Holloway's world record in the 60-meter hurdles was startling enough by itself. </p><p>   Holloway's time of 7.29, set Wednesday at an indoor meet in Madrid, surpassed a mark that had stood since 1994 -- three years before the 23-year-old Holloway was born. It continued a streak of wins at the distance that track-geek site letsrun.com called \"easily the greatest 60-meter hurdles season the world has ever seen.\" </p><p>   Even more remarkable than Holloway's speed, though, is how he's achieving it. In an era that's been overtaken by game-changing high-tech shoes, he wasn't wearing them. </p><p>   Nike-sponsored athletes have turned the distance-running world upside down in recent years, shattering records in the marathon with its Vaporfly and similar shoes. The company sent competitors scrambling to mimic the models, which have thick, ultralight cushioning and carbon-fiber plates that some runners said function like springboards. </p><p>   This year, middle- and shorter-distance runners are toppling records wearing high-tech versions of the spike shoes worn on the track. </p><p>   The Nike Air Zoom Victory, designed for races of distances from 800 to 5,000 meters, includes a carbon-fiber plate that \"provides a snappy sensation with each step,\" according to the company website. New Balance, Adidas and others are getting into the game. </p><p>   This month Britain's Elliot Giles wore high-tech spikes while smashing the British indoor 800-meter record -- a mark that had been held since 1982 by the great Olympic champion Sebastian Coe -- by one second, finishing in 1 minute, 43.63 seconds. It was also the second-fastest 800-meter indoor time ever. </p><p>   For his record run, the Adidas-sponsored Holloway was wearing conventional track spikes. </p><p>   \"As we speak here, his footwear is the same as it's always been, without that high-tech component put in,\" said his agent, John Regis, in a phone interview. </p><p>   Holloway, who was unavailable for an interview, is achieving his marks without special materials -- just skill, training and charisma. </p><p>   \"Hurdlers are sprinters with attitudes,\" Holloway told track's international governing body, World Athletics, after his world record. \"Our event is sexier than just a regular fast sprint because we have barriers in our way.\" </p><p>   Holloway is the kind of young star that U.S. track and field craves. A former three-star wide receiver recruit out of Chesapeake, Va., he spurned football to pursue track at the University of Florida and chase his dream of becoming an Olympian. Videos on his Instagram account, @flaamingoo_, show him separating himself from the pack even in the shortest of sprints. </p><p></p>",
