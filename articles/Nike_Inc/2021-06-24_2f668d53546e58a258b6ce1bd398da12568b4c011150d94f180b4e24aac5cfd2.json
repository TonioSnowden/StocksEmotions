  "title": "Sports:  Record-Smashing Teen Aims for Olympics  ---  Hobbs Kessler broke Jim Ryun's 1,500-meter American junior record, which stood for 55 years  ----  By Rachel Bachman",
  "text": "<p>   In five months, Hobbs Kessler has gone from a largely unknown high-school runner to national record holder to surprise competitor in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials. </p><p>   As Kessler prepared for Thursday's 1,500-meter preliminaries in Eugene, Ore., he was honest about what fueled his rise: a large dose of testosterone. </p><p>   \"I would say the biggest thing that helped me was going through puberty,\" he said. </p><p>   Kessler had other benefits besides the natural hormones that made him bigger and stronger. The Ann Arbor, Mich., 18-year-old has parents who coach and are accomplished athletes. Kessler honed his body and focus by rock climbing. And he runs with an elite training group guided by a 77-year-old Marine Corps Vietnam veteran. </p><p>   Kessler's talent is \"probably the best I've ever coached,\" said Ron Warhurst, who worked at the University of Michigan for more than three decades in track and cross-country running. \"And I've coached nine Olympians, numerous NCAA champions.\" </p><p>   Warhurst now oversees a training group that includes Kessler; four-time New Zealand Olympian and two-time medalist Nick Willis; Mason Ferlic, who advanced to Friday's Olympic trials finals in the steeplechase; and Mitchell Black, a four-time NCAA Division III 800-meter champion at Tufts University. </p><p>   Kessler appeared on the radar of track geeks in February, when he broke the high-school record for the indoor mile with a time of 3:57.66. His leap into a wider public eye came May 29, days before he finished high school, when he ran in a Portland, Ore., race alongside pros and uncorked a performance that electrified the running world. </p><p>   Kessler ran 1,500 meters in 3:34.36, breaking the U.S. high-school record along with Jim Ryun's American junior record that had stood for 55 years. </p><p>   Finishing in the trials' top three to make the U.S. Olympic team would mark another rare feat. If Kessler qualifies for the Olympic 1,500, he could become the second-youngest American male behind Ryun to compete in the event's 125-year history, according to Olympic historian Bill Mallon. </p><p>   Kessler's competition is fierce, including 2016 Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz, 2019 world championships finalist Craig Engels, and Yared Nuguse, the Notre Dame runner who recently broke the NCAA record in the 1,500. (Kessler's breakout 1,500 run was a hair faster even than that.) </p><p>   Although he rubs shoulders with some of the world's top athletes, Kessler has mostly lived like a high schooler. He attended a smaller magnet school but competed for Ann Arbor's Skyline High. </p><p>   Growing up, Kessler's first love was rock climbing, and he was nationally competitive from a young age. That pursuit has helped sharpen his focus, those around him say. </p><p>   \"You know, you're up 20 feet in the air, and it's you against the rock,\" Warhurst said. \"I think that's a tremendous, very strong mindset that he has.\" </p><p>   Kessler's greatness began with genetics. Warhurst said the teenager benefits from long legs, an abundance of lean muscle \"plus one hell of an internal engine.\" </p><p>   When Kessler can't make the six-hour drive to Kentucky for a serious outdoor climb, he scrambles up the climbing wall in the barn in the Kesslers' backyard. That helps him maintain core strength and \"brings him solace and joy,\" says his mother, Serena Kessler. </p><p>   Serena Kessler competed in the 2012 U.S. Olympic marathon trials and finished second among women in the 2011 Detroit Marathon -- a fact her son gleefully relayed in a recent running podcast. </p><p>   To earn spending money, Kessler has worked for a mobile knife-sharpening service -- he recommends trusting the job to the pros -- as well as repairing roofs and cleaning gutters.\"I kind of still do that on the weekends a lot,\" Kessler said, \"if I'm not . . .\" </p><p>   At the Olympic trials? </p><p>   \"That's right.\" </p><p>   Kessler spent some of his gutter-cleaning money on Nike track shoes, part of a new wave of \"super spikes\" that appear to be helping runners obliterate records. Kessler says the shoes \"definitely help,\" but those around him say the young man wearing them has a far greater influence on his race times. </p><p>   \"You might think it's all spikes or whatever, but that kid is amazing,\" said Henry Wynne, a pro runner for Brooks who finished just ahead of Kessler in the Portland race, and is set to run in the trials. \"He's the most talented runner in the U.S. in a long time -- maybe ever.\" </p><p>   Kessler has committed to attend and run for Northern Arizona next fall. But his fast rise has driven speculation that he might turn pro out of high school. </p><p>   \"The benefits of going pro would have to outweigh missing the experience of going to college,\" Kessler said. \"That's kind of where we're at now.\" </p><p>   He acknowledged that it's been strange being thrust into the spotlight.\"It's definitely bizarre,\" Kessler said. \"But I think I've adapted to it pretty quickly.\" </p><p></p>",
