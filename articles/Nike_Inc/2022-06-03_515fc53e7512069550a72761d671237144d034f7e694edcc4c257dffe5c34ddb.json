  "title": "U.S. News:  Avenatti Given Four Years for Stealing From Daniels  ----  By Corinne Ramey",
  "text": "<p>   Onetime celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was sentenced to four years in prison Thursday for stealing $300,000 from the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, whom he represented in her battles with former President Donald Trump. </p><p>   U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in New York said Mr. Avenatti, 51 years old, took advantage of a vulnerable victim by stealing book payments from Ms. Daniels. Mr. Avenatti was convicted earlier this year on wire fraud and aggravated identity-theft charges. </p><p>   The sentence would send a message to lawyers and those in the legal profession, Judge Furman said. </p><p>   \"If you go astray in the way Mr. Avenatti did, you will pay a steep price,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Avenatti began serving a 2 1/2-year sentence for a separate extortion conviction in early February. Thursday's sentence will add 2 1/2 years to his expected time in prison because some of the four-year term will be served concurrently. Judge Furman also ordered Mr. Avenatti to pay $148,750 in restitution. </p><p>   Prosecutors had asked Judge Furman to sentence Mr. Avenatti to a \"substantial\" prison term, with the new sentence to be served after his existing prison sentence ends. </p><p>   Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said at the sentencing that Mr. Avenatti betrayed Ms. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford. He not only stole her money \"but lied to her again and again,\" Mr. Podolsky said. </p><p>   Mr. Avenatti's lawyers had asked Judge Furman to sentence him to what amounted to an additional two years in prison, saying Mr. Avenatti had already suffered consequences from his actions, including the end of his law career. </p><p>   \"There is no doubt I made a series of mistakes and exercised poor judgment,\" Mr. Avenatti told the judge at the sentencing. </p><p>   Ms. Daniels, the prosecution's star witness at the trial, didn't attend the sentencing. </p><p>   Mr. Avenatti was convicted in 2020 of three felonies for his failed efforts to extort Nike Inc. In California, a federal judge last year declared a mistrial in a case in which prosecutors accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing client funds. A retrial is scheduled for this summer. </p><p></p>",
