  "text": "<p>For so much of that career, Federer seemed as if he would go down as the all-time men's leader for Grand Slam titles. He rounded past his idol Pete Sampras with his 15th major championship in 2009 and topped the list until 2022. But by then, his career had become inextricably linked to the other members of tennis's Big Three, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.</p><p>As Federer struggled with injuries in recent years, Nadal overtook his tally at this year's Australian Open and now sits in first place with 22 major titles, having also won Roland-Garros this year. Djokovic is also ahead of Federer with 21, following his win this year at Wimbledon.</p><p>Federer, who will say goodbye at the Laver Cup exhibition in London next week, underwent knee surgery last year in the faint hope of returning to the pro circuit for a last hurrah. But as the recovery dragged and tennis kept speeding up, the Swiss master shotmaker realized it was time to call it a day. The man who once looked untouchable now retires in third place on the list of men's major championships.</p><p>His dizzying final scorecard reads: eight Wimbledon championships, six Australian Opens, five U.S. Opens, and one Roland-Garros. He picked up 103 titles on tour, one Olympic doubles gold medal for Switzerland, and at one point spent a record 237 straight weeks as the No. 1 ranked player in the world. It earned him $130,594,339 in prize money alone, according to the ATP Tour.</p><p>Federer's decision to step away from the game was the second exit by an all-time great in September alone. Earlier this month, 23-time major winner Serena Williams, who shared the stage with Federer for his entire career, also transitioned into an expected retirement following her defeat in the third round of the U.S. Open.</p><p>\"He's just a synopsis of greatness and class and amazing and really changed the game,\" Williams said of Federer last year. \"You see players playing like him, moving like him, doing his techniques. The guy is genius.\"</p><p>When it came to Grand Slam tournaments, Federer was the very definition of ever present. From 2000 until a major knee injury in 2016, he played in an unbroken run of 65 consecutive majors, winning 17. His subsequent recovery and return to world No. 1 in 2018, at age 36, also counts among his greatest achievements.</p><p>During that time, his on-court brilliance, clean-cut image, and comfort in at least three languages made him a magnet for sponsors, from the watch and chocolate endorsements that come with being a Swiss superstar, to his long-term deal with Nike, which ended in 2018 and was replaced by a nine-figure, 10-year contract with Uniqlo. The Japanese outfitter wanted to be associated with him for the rest of his playing days and well into his retirement, whenever it happened to come.</p><p>Federer's longevity would have seemed even more miraculous had he not played in the sport's golden era of thirtysomethings. Djokovic and Nadal are still winning majors past 35. Federer himself claimed his final Slam at 37, defeating Marin Cilic at the 2018 Australian Open. At the time, it was his third title in five major championships.</p><p>\"Winning it is an absolute dream come true,\" he said then through tears. \"I love you guys, thank you.\"</p><p>Still, the cracks had begun to show.</p><p>After reaching the final of Wimbledon in 2019, which he lost to Djokovic, Federer used the pandemic hiatus to nurse his twice-repaired knee. He then returned to the All England Club in 2021, only to fall in the quarterfinals. That summer, he went on to make the last big bet of his career: Federer had knee surgery again.</p><p>\"I want to be healthy. I want to be running around later as well, and I want to give myself a glimmer of hope, also, to return to the tour in some shape or form,\" he said when he revealed the procedure. \"I am realistic, don't get me wrong. I know how difficult it is at this age right now to do another surgery and try it.\"</p><p>Federer's seemingly effortless game—which combined balletic movement with a powerful serve and routine feats of geometry—created a sense that age might be gentler on him than most. But if his tennis appeared timeless, his knees very much weren't.</p><p>\"I also know my body's capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear,\" Federer said on Thursday.</p><p>Nowhere was he more beloved than on the grass courts of Wimbledon, the tournament whose history and tradition most closely matched Federer's classic style. He won the junior tournament there as a hot-headed teenager in 1998 and his first major title at the All England Club in 2003 when he was 21. At a celebration for the 100th anniversary of Centre Court this summer, Federer received the loudest ovation among 26 former champions.</p><p>No one knew for certain then that it would be his farewell, but it was fitting enough. Not only had his highest highs come on that court, it was also where the Swiss kid with a ponytail first announced himself to the wider world in 2001, by taking down Sampras in five sets.</p><p>\"It's grass-court tennis,\" Sampras said at the time. \"One minute you feel like you have it, the next minute you're walking off the court.\"</p><p>The difference for Federer was that his minute lasted another 20 years.</p><p>Write to Joshua Robinson at Joshua.Robinson@wsj.com</p><p>Roger Federer Announces Retirement From Tennis</p>",
