  "title": "T-Mobile Posts Strong Gains in Wireless Customers, Raises Outlook; Company says it has opportunity to gain market share from higher-cost rivals as inflation pressures consumers",
  "text": "<p>Investors and analysts track postpaid phone customers to gauge wireless-company health because it measures trends among reliable monthly bill-payers. AT&amp;T Inc. added 813,000 postpaid phone customers, though it warned that some subscribers were falling behind on their monthly bills. Verizon Communications Inc., the largest in the industry, added 12,000 net postpaid phone connections. The two companies reported earnings last week.</p><p>T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said inflation presented opportunities for a company with a history of serving cash-strapped customers. T-Mobile earlier this year raised fees attached to some plans, though its rivals have introduced sharper rate hikes in recent months.</p><p>\"There is a flight to value that is beginning to happen, and T-Mobile is famous for value in our category,\" Mr. Sievert said on a call with analysts.</p><p>Bad-debt expense rose to $311 million in the June quarter, up from $210 million in the previous quarter and $72 million a year earlier. That can point to trouble in some areas of the economy, but Mr. Sievert said bad debt is closer to a \"more historic level\" the company is comfortable with.</p><p>T-Mobile still swung to a $108 million loss in the second quarter, or 9 cents a share, from a profit of $978 million, or 78 cents, a year earlier. Overall revenue fell 1.2% to $19.7 billion.</p><p>The reported loss also included nearly $1 billion of higher costs related to the write-down of a wired network the company acquired from Sprint; a legal settlement tied to the 2021 theft of data on millions of current, former and potential customers; and other expenses.</p><p>The company raised its guidance for the year, saying it expects net postpaid customer additions of between 6 million and 6.3 million, up from its earlier projection of 5.3 million to 5.8 million. It also slightly revised upward its free-cash-flow target to between $7.3 billion and $7.6 billion.</p><p>T-Mobile shares rose about 3.5% on Wednesday morning to $138.69.</p><p>Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alex Harring at alex.harring@wsj.com</p><p>T-Mobile Posts Strong Gains in Wireless Customers, Raises Outlook</p>",
