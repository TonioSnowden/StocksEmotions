  "title": "What Happened After the 9/11 Attacks, From Guantanamo Bay to the Mosque Dispute; In the past 20 years, uncertainty lingered over the suspects' fate, controversy surrounded a proposed mosque and a political star fell from grace",
  "text": "<p>Here's a look at some of topics after the attacks and where they stand now:</p><p>Cantor Fitzgerald</p><p>In 2001, the New York City headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial-services firm founded in 1945, occupied the 101st to 105th floors of the World Trade Center's North Tower.</p><p>At the time of the Sept. 11 attacks, the firm was the nation's dominant bond broker, controlling as much as 75% of all trading in long-term Treasurys, such as the benchmark 10-year Treasury note.</p><p>The first of the two planes—American Airlines Flight 11—struck Tower One just below the firm's offices, trapping many people on the higher floors and forcing its trading system offline. Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees in the attacks, two-thirds of its New York City workforce.</p><p>Chief Executive Howard Lutnick wasn't in the building that morning because he took his son to his first day of school. His younger brother, Gary, a 36-year-old managing director at the firm, was among those killed.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick pledged to take care of the families of employees who were killed, creating the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund in the days after the attacks. For five years, Cantor Fitzgerald provided 25% of the firm's profits to families, a total of about $180 million. It provided 10 years of healthcare to victims' families.</p><p>In 2004, the financial-services company sued American Airlines, alleging negligence in allowing the hijackers to board the flight and seeking to recoup property and business losses incurred during the attack. In December 2013, the airline and its insurers agreed to a $135 million settlement.</p><p>Cantor Fitzgerald was also among organizations that sued Saudi Arabia for allegedly giving the hijackers and al Qaeda money.</p><p>In the years since the attack, Cantor Fitzgerald moved its global headquarters uptown and has branched out its bond-brokerage business to an array of other financial services.</p><p>Deanna Paul</p><p>Flight Schools</p><p>The 9/11 hijackers who took control of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in a field near Shanksville, Pa., trained in various private flight schools and on flight simulators across the country in states including Florida, California and Arizona.</p><p>The terrorist group decided to train in the U.S. rather than in their previous base in Germany because they found the training in America would be cheaper and faster, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. The men trained on smaller aircraft, although they told instructors they wanted to learn how to fly jets. Some of the flight instructors who worked with the men noticed they focused on learning how to control aircraft when flying, but showed no interest in takeoffs or landings, according to the report.</p><p>Mohamed Atta and Marwan al Shehhi—who flew the planes that crashed into the North Tower and South Tower of the World Trade Center, respectively, passed commercial pilot tests in mid-December 2000 and began training to fly large jets on flight simulators. Ziad Jarrah—who flew the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania—and Hani Hanjour, who hijacked the plane that struck the Pentagon—sought out training flights along the \"Hudson Corridor\" in June 2001, a low-altitude route along the Hudson River that passes landmarks in Manhattan. Mr. Hanjour rented a plane for a practice flight that took him on a route that passed near Washington, to assess the feasibility of targeting the White House.</p><p>Robert Rockmaker, president and chief executive of the Flight School Association of North America, said that more security measures were put in place at flight schools following the Sept. 11 attacks, including new background checks for both U.S. citizens and non-U. S. citizens and nationals.</p><p>Non-U.S. citizens who wish to learn how to fly in the country must also be fingerprinted, he said. Flight-school personnel and flight instructors must undergo security-awareness training and keep records of training.</p><p>Laura Cooper</p><p>'Ground Zero Mosque'</p><p>A plan to build a large mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center sparked a national debate. Some who opposed it said it would amount to a victory for the Muslim extremists who brought down the Twin Towers. Some who supported it said the attacks had nothing to do with Islam.</p><p>Proposed in 2010, the project, initially known as Cordoba House but later known as Park51, was meant to be a 13-story $100 million Islamic center, with developers saying it would promote interfaith dialogue and include non-Muslim board members.</p><p>Park51 received numerous New York City approvals and had the backing of then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But the debate went far beyond the city. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said it would desecrate the hallowed ground of 9/11. Donald Trump offered to buy out a key investor to kill the project.</p><p>The developers changed course in 2011 during a dispute with landlord Consolidated Edison, proposing a condo tower with an Islamic museum next door. The new project is called 45 Park Place.</p><p>Michael Amon</p><p>Guantanamo Bay: 'The Least Worst Place'</p><p>At a December 2001 press conference, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as \"the least worst place\" to house prisoners from Afghanistan, which the U.S. invaded following the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>Another official was more candid: Because the territory technically belonged to Cuba but was controlled by the U.S., Bush administration lawyers imagined it the \"legal equivalent of outer space,\" where neither American, Cuban nor international courts could review interrogation methods, military prosecutions or prison conditions.</p><p>The Supreme Court found otherwise, in a series of decisions through 2008 forbidding inhumane treatment and allowing inmates a limited right to challenge unlawful detention.</p><p>The Bush administration, which released most of nearly 800 men who at some point were held at Guantanamo, began looking toward closing the facility. But when President Barack Obama began taking concrete steps in that direction, a political backlash, led by Republicans but joined by many Democrats, ensued. Congress barred transferring Guantanamo inmates to mainland prisons. New York politicians shot down plans to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others accused of the 9/11 plot in the city where the attacks took place.</p><p>President Biden has said that Guantanamo should close, but 39 detainees remain, including 10 enmeshed in slow-moving military prosecutions. There are markers that suggest the fading of the 9/11 era: the June death of Mr. Rumsfeld, the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the restoration of the Taliban regime. But Guantanamo persists, a living legacy to a war now passed.</p><p>Jess Bravin</p><p>'Let's Roll': The Rallying Cry of United 93</p><p>Passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93—the last of the four planes to be hijacked on Sept. 11—banded together to fight back against the terrorists that took hold of their flight and aimed to crash it in Washington.</p><p>The flight set off from Newark, N.J., destined for San Francisco with 44 people on board, including four hijackers in the first-class cabin.</p><p>Passengers on the plane learned of the World Trade Center attack through phone calls and realized that their flight had also been hijacked. They voted among themselves to rush the cockpit in an attempt to retake the plane and began an assault on the cockpit at 9:57 a.m., while the airliner was over Pennsylvania.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your memories from 9/11? Join the conversation below.</p><p>One of the last phone calls placed from the flight was between Todd Beamer, a passenger, and a Verizon Airfone supervisor named Lisa Jefferson. His last audible words were \"Let's roll,\" a rallying cry to his fellow passengers to begin their assault on the hijackers. The passengers' attempt to regain the cockpit is credited with keeping the hijackers from striking a target in Washington.</p><p>The hijackers intended to crash the aircraft into symbols of America, like the White House or the Capitol, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. Instead, the plane crashed into an empty field near Shanksville, Pa., about 20 minutes' flying time from the intended target area. All those on board perished.</p><p>Mr. Beamer's wife, Lisa Beamer, published a book in 2002 entitled \"Let's Roll!\" about her husband, the heroics of Flight 93 and dealing with the grief of his loss. She started the Todd M. Beamer Foundation—later known as Heroic Choices—focused on helping children suffering from trauma.</p><p>Laura Cooper</p><p>Remaining 9/11 Suspects</p><p>The chief suspect in organizing the 9/11 plot was captured in 2003. His trial hasn't begun. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants are scheduled to spend the weeks surrounding the terrorist attacks' 20th anniversary in pretrial hearings before a military commission at Guantanamo Bay.</p><p>President George W. Bush signed a November 2001 order authorizing military commissions to prosecute suspected foreign terrorists without affording them constitutional rights, the goal being swift, if not summary, trial of enemy prisoners.</p><p>The plan found few champions in the Pentagon and suffered repeated legal setbacks, including a 2006 Supreme Court decision forcing the government to scrap the plan in favor of congressionally approved commissions providing defendants basic rights but leaving unclear how far those extend.</p><p>In 2008, the head of military commissions dismissed charges against a sixth defendant, Mohammed al-Qahtani, after finding that military personnel tortured him. In 2017, her successor, Harvey Rishikof, tried to broker a plea bargain for life terms after concluding that courts were likely to void any capital sentences in light of the torture the remaining five defendants suffered while in Central Intelligence Agency custody; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis fired Mr. Rishikof for what he said were unrelated reasons.</p><p>Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder tried to move the trial into federal court in New York, where Justice Department prosecutors have a nearly unbroken conviction rate in terrorism cases. Objections from both Republicans and New York Democrats killed that plan.</p><p>Jess Bravin</p><p>Rudy Giuliani</p><p>As New York City mayor during the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, Rudy Giuliani led the rescue and recovery efforts, emerging as a hero amid national tragedy. Oprah Winfrey called him \"America's mayor.\"</p><p>A New York University School of Law graduate and former federal prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York by Ronald Reagan in 1983, and captured the public eye through a spate of high-profile Wall Street and mafia prosecutions. Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who was elected mayor in 1993 and served until 2002, is also credited with sharp declines in New York City's murder rates, largely due to his tough-on-crime stance and aggressive policing tactics.</p><p>After a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, Mr. Giuliani was a partner at large law firms, including Bracewell LLP and Greenberg Traurig LLP. Since 2016, he has been closely aligned with former President Donald Trump, joining the legal team representing him in the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani has served as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer since then, playing a prominent role in the campaign to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Earlier this year, Mr. Giuliani's law license was suspended in New York and Washington, D.C., for making false statements during this effort. He faces disbarment and is the subject of a criminal investigation by the office he once led. Federal agents searched his New York apartment in April as part of a continuing probe by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine and possible violations of federal lobbying laws. An attorney for Mr. Giuliani previously called the search warrant \"legal thuggery\" and said that Mr. Giuliani had already agreed to answer investigators' questions.</p><p>Deanna Paul</p><p>What Happened After the 9/11 Attacks, From Guantanamo Bay to the Mosque Dispute</p>",
