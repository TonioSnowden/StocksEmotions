  "title": "Comcast's Profit Boosted by Olympics --- Strong growth at NBCUniversal came as company's broadband business slowed",
  "text": "<p>Comcast's results show how customer habits changed drastically during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and how they are slowly reverting to normal.</p><p>The company, which operates Xfinity-brand cable services, NBCUniversal and the U.K. pay-TV company Sky, saw its broadband-internet business slow down in the third quarter after experiencing strong user growth for several quarters, when many Americans were spending most of their time at home because of Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>On the other hand, many of its businesses that were once deeply affected by these restrictions, such as movie production and theme parks, are rebounding.</p><p>Comcast said it added 300,000 broadband subscribers, less than half as many as it did in the same period last year. Its cellphone business, Xfinity Mobile, had its best quarterly result since it launched in 2017, adding 285,000 customers. Comcast's pay-TV business, meanwhile, continued to lose subscribers. The 408,000 cable-TV customers it lost during the quarter were nearly 50% more than what it lost a year earlier.</p><p>Overall, the company's cable communications unit, which comprises its pay-TV, broadband and mobile-phone business, was still Comcast's largest revenue contributor, accounting for $16.12 billion of the company's $30.3 billion in revenue.</p><p>Comcast executives said Thursday that the slowdown in broadband-subscriber growth was partly due to fewer people moving during the latest quarter. Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson said the company has added more than 1.1 million broadband customers year-to-date, and that Comcast has added more than one million each year for the last 20 years.</p><p>Comcast is making a foray into the smart-TV industry, placing a bigger bet as a distributor of apps and taking on incumbent players including Roku Inc., as media companies push for more streaming subscribers. Comcast's U.S. smart-TVs, which were launched earlier this month, come with a one-year free subscription to NBCUniversal's Peacock to give a boost to the streaming service, which has lagged behind competitors in customer growth.</p><p>Chief Executive Brian Roberts on Thursday called the company's push into smart-TVs \"the embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation.\"</p><p>The company didn't provide specific metrics regarding Peacock's subscriber base on Thursday, but NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said the streaming service added a few million more monthly active accounts.</p><p>In July, the company said Peacock had more than 20 million monthly active accounts and 54 million sign-ups. Comcast has yet to disclose other details such as the proportion of customers paying for Peacock's premium $4.99 or $9.99-a-month tiers. The $4.99-a-month ad-supported version is free to customers with cable bundles or Flex boxes, as well as those using Cox Communications Inc. Peacock will also launch on Sky next month.</p>",
