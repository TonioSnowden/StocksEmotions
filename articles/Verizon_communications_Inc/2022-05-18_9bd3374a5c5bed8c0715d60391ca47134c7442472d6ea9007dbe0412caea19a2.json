  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Big Carriers Are Running the Show at the FCC",
  "text": "<p>   I admire Thomas Hazlett's valuable work on the history of U.S. spectrum policy, as he graciously acknowledges in his op-ed (\"The U.S. May Repeat Mexico's Wireless Spectrum Mistake,\" May 13). But his article misrepresents my views and the goals of Rivada Networks, the company I founded. </p><p>   Mr. Hazlett writes that \"to adopt a plan imposed by regulators would allocate bandwidth top-down -- reprising the twist of the 1927 Radio Act, which centralized bandwidth control.\" But it is a myth, perpetuated by the big-carrier oligopoly, that spectrum is not allocated from the top down today. </p><p>   All commercial spectrum allocation in the U.S. is controlled by the Federal Communications Commission, which is effectively controlled by the carriers. Witness the case of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The FCC had developed a plan that would have facilitated new entrants to bid on that spectrum. The carriers objected, the auctions were delayed for years and when the frequencies were finally licensed, it was largely on terms dictated by AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile. </p><p>   After the recent C-Band auction, AT&amp;T was left short of midband spectrum that it needed for 5G rollout. So Congress jammed an allocation of 100MHz of midband spectrum into December 2020's Covid-relief bill. The big winner of the subsequent auction? AT&amp;T. </p><p>   In a \"market\" in which government has nationalized the asset -- spectrum -- everything is top-down. America's big three like to pose as defenders of free markets, but they are the big winners from the nationalization that Mr. Hazlett so ably recounts in his book \"The Political Spectrum.\" As a consequence, America enjoys some of the highest consumer-data prices in the world. This is a triumph not of market economics but of regulatory capture by a cozy industry with huge lobbying budgets and rich lawyers. </p><p>   Declan Ganley </p><p>   Chairman and CEO, Rivada Networks </p><p>   Galway, Ireland </p><p></p>",
