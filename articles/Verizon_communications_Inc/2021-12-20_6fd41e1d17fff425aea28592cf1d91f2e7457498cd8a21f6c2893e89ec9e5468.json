  "title": "YouTube TV, Disney Settle Impasse  ----  By Patience Haggin and Lillian Rizzo",
  "text": "<p>   YouTube TV and Walt Disney Co. reached a deal on Sunday to restore access to Disney-owned channels including ESPN and FX for YouTube TV subscribers. </p><p>   The deal ended a brief blackout that began at the stroke of midnight Saturday after the carriage contract between the two companies expired. YouTube TV has more than four million subscribers, a person familiar with the operation said. </p><p>   Terms of the new contract weren't disclosed. </p><p>   The standoff was over distribution fees that Google's YouTube TV pays to stream a package of channels owned by Disney, whose holdings include the ABC broadcast network and its local stations as well as more than dozen cable channels. </p><p>   \"We apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience as we continued to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Disney's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement,\" a YouTube spokeswoman said. YouTube parent Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc. </p><p>   A Disney spokeswoman said the company appreciates \"Google's collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market.\" </p><p>   Besides fees, another sticking point was YouTube TV's request for a clause that would guarantee it pays the same rate as distributors of a similar size, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   YouTube TV promised it would drop its monthly subscription price to $49.99 from $64.99 as long as the channels were unavailable. To make good on that promise, YouTube TV said it will grant a one-time $15 credit to affected subscribers. </p><p>   Although YouTube TV doesn't disclose the number of subscribers, a person close to the company said it is more than four million. Its subscriber count tops the traditional pay-TV providers Altice USA Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., according to data from MoffettNathanson. </p><p>   The impasse between the programmer and distributor spilled out into the public last week when YouTube began to notify subscribers that they could soon lose access to Disney's programming. YouTube TV also took the unusual step of encouraging subscribers to purchase a subscription to Disney's streaming services such as Disney+ and ESPN+ to regain access to some of the content they would lose. </p><p></p>",
