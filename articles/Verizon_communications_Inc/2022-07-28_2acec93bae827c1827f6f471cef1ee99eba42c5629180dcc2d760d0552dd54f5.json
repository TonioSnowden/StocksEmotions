  "title": "Verizon stock downgraded as Bank of America waits 'for 5G to be a thing'; 'Verizon's understandable fixationâ€¦on \"what is next\" led it down a path where, unfortunately, it now falls short on \"what is now,\"' analyst says",
  "text": "<p>In his view, that's because there was a clearer use for 4G in its early days than there is for 5G today. With 4G technology, there was \"so tangible\" a need for 4G connections that the technology was \"market moving,\" thanks to innovations at the time like Apple Inc.'s AAPL App Store and the growing market for Android devices, which demanded powerful speeds. With 5G, there isn't yet that same killer use case.</p><p>\"Verizon's understandable fixation, therefore, on 'what is next' led it down a path where, unfortunately, it now falls short on 'what is now,'\" Barden wrote. \"It remains a forward-thinking team with premium assets and every right to win down the road when the market knows what to do with these assets and how to value them.\"</p><p>See also: Comcast stock heads for worst slide since 2008 as earnings show broadband growth screeching to halt</p><p>He downgraded Verizon's stock to neutral from buy in his note to clients, writing that it was a \"mistake\" not to have done so before the company's latest earnings report that he had realized was \"widely\" expected to be weak.</p><p>Verizon shares are up 0.2% in Thursday morning trading.</p><p>\"What is clear now is that Verizon faces a conundrum similar to that which the cable industry faces today,\" Barden continued. \"After 20 years of default dominance, the foundational premise of that dominance, network 'quality', in truth may no longer matter.\"</p><p>Instead, \"[w]hat matters more is plan pricing, handset subsidy, and general apathy or inertia.\"</p><p>Barden doesn't have a great feeling about Verizon's third-quarter results, which he thinks will be similar to second-quarter numbers in showing benefits from price hikes as well as a \"bubble\" of churn. While the fourth quarter is typically better for the broader industry, he wonders how Verizon will be able to differentiate itself at a time when wireless deals are usually abundant. Then he sees the potential for sobering outlooks alongside the fourth-quarter report and an expected investor day next spring.</p><p>Read: As Twitter rethinks its San Francisco footprint, a bigger $9 billion question hangs over the city's office market</p><p>He said that the company's longer-term forecast \"needs to come down\" given previously expected contributions related to 5G opportunities. \"We have diminished confidence these new revenue sources will materialize in the near term at the level VZ anticipated at its analyst day\" in 2022, he wrote.</p><p>\"Once a new bar is set early next year, we expect it will be an opportune moment to revisit the stock's relative performance outlook,\" Barden added.</p><p>Shares have fallen 7% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 5%.</p><p>Verizon stock downgraded as Bank of America waits 'for 5G to be a thing'</p>",
