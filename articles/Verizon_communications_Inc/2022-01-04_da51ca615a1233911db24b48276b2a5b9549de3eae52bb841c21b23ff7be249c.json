  "text": "<p>Now, the hardiest of BlackBerry diehards, who clung to the final moment of service, are finally having to let go. Sort of. Some are refusing to give up their nonfunctioning gadgets and turning them into alarm clocks or art. </p><p>Fans knew this was coming: BlackBerry announced the date more than a year ago. Only BlackBerry phones running on Android software, like the nearly four-year-old Key2, will continue working.</p><p>Even though Mr. Balfour's BlackBerry couldn't summon an Uber or stream a Netflix show, it could last days without needing a charge. And typing emails on its keyboard was a breeze. He bought a BlackBerry Key2 last week but waited until the last minute to upgrade.</p><p>\"I'm actually pretty sad,\" said the 42-year-old from Ottawa. \"I don't fully understand why they need to get rid of it.\" He keeps five or six old BlackBerrys from the past 20 years stashed in a desk drawer.</p><p>Claude Millman adored his BlackBerry phones so much, two of them now hang in a frame in his New Jersey lake house.</p><p>He had to break up with BlackBerry in 2019, when his phone died and he couldn't find a replacement. The curvature of the keyboard was addicting, he said, and allowed the New York civil litigator to write affidavits or long emails with ease. At a hotel lobby in Paris recently, he spotted a BlackBerry in someone's hands.</p><p>\"It was kind of exciting to see,\" said Mr. Millman, 58. \"I wanted to reach out and touch it.\"</p><p>The BlackBerry, once cutting-edge technology that allowed executives, world leaders and reality-TV stars to send emails from the palm of their hand for the first time, is near death.</p><p>BlackBerry Ltd. said in September 2020 that it would eventually pull the plug, making the phones unable to make calls, send texts or dial 911. It is part of BlackBerry's shift from making phones to selling security software to corporations and governments. The company said it could have cut service sooner, but the 16-month notice was \"an expression of thanks\" to loyal users.</p><p>It's unclear how many people were still using an older BlackBerry. The company didn't respond to a request for comment, and neither did major carriers AT&amp;T, T-Mobile or Verizon Wireless.</p><p>First launched as a text pager in 1996 by Canadian company Research In Motion Ltd., a BlackBerry phone came a couple of years later. It started to look outdated in 2007, when Apple Inc. released the touch-screen iPhone. Android smartphones soon came after.</p><p>BlackBerry handset sales peaked at 52.3 million in 2011before swiftly declining. But fans who liked the feel of the physical button keyboards kept the BlackBerry alive.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama, who used a BlackBerry while campaigning, kept using it until at least 2016, his last year in office. Reality-TV star Kim Kardashian gave it up in 2016 when her BlackBerry Bold died and she couldn't find a replacement on eBay. \"Reality is starting to set in &amp; I'm getting sad,\" she tweeted at the time.</p><p>Carrie Bradshaw is still clinging to a BlackBerry. The fictional character, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, is seen texting on one in the \"Sex and the City\" reboot that made its debut last month on HBO Max and takes place in the present day.</p><p>Former BlackBerry CEO Jim Balsillie was so attached to the phone that after he resigned from the company in 2012 he told a Toronto audience \"you'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.\"</p><p>Mr. Balsillie decided three years ago to switch his BlackBerry for an Android phone with a licensed BlackBerry keyboard because he said it offered superior phone security. It also offered a hub of BlackBerry software and services such as texting, email, calendars and tasks.</p><p>\"The sad day for me will be when they kill the hub and I'm not kidding myself, that might happen,\" he said Monday. BlackBerry didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Duane Bratt fears that day will come soon. The political-science professor from Calgary, Canada, uses a Key2, but worries there won't be any future phones to replace it with.</p><p>\"I've tried to resist the Apple cult, but it's getting harder,\" said Mr. Bratt, 54.</p><p>BlackBerry stopped manufacturing phones in 2016 but has licensed its name and keyboard to other phone makers. It announced a deal in 2020 with OnwardMobility to design, make and release a new phone last year with a BlackBerry keyboard but it hasn't yet materialized.</p><p>BlackBerry and OnwardMobility didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Carol Miller of London has found another use for a touch-screen BlackBerry she had to stop using about a year ago: an alarm clock. There's no chance of it ringing in the middle of the night with a call, she said. Although, Ms. Miller wishes she could still use it as a phone.</p><p>\"Such a shame all this,\" said Ms. Miller, 54. \"For me, they were the best phones.\"</p><p>In a blog post Tuesday, BlackBerry CEO John Chen said that it was the end of an era, as the company has shifted into new areas. \"Letting go of the past is always bittersweet, even when a brighter future awaits,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have been holding off on decommissioning the BlackBerry service out of loyalty to our customers for a long time,\" he said.</p><p>Jacquie McNish contributed to this article.</p><p>BlackBerry Die-Hards Struggle With Final Blow</p>",
