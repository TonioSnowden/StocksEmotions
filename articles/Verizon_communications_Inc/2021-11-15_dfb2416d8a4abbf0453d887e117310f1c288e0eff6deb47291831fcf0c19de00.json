  "title": "U.S. News: Agencies Feud Over Aviation Safety, 5G Rollout",
  "text": "<p>Almost a year earlier, transportation officials had asked to postpone the government's auction of the airwaves to wireless operators and warned they could impose flight restrictions if not satisfied. The Dec. 1, 2020, letter -- sent days before the auction -- said the FAA was worried 5G services could interfere with key cockpit safety systems.</p><p>Trump administration officials said they didn't agree with the FAA's last-minute concerns, and the Federal Communications Commission went ahead with its auction. Companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon spent $81 billion for the prized licenses, setting a record.</p><p>That windfall didn't settle the argument. The air-safety debate that flared up in the final months of the Trump administration, which was eager to advance the country's 5G networks, continued into the Biden administration, which was slow to appoint key FCC and Commerce Department officials who could help resolve the dispute.</p><p>Regulators are now working on a tight deadline.</p><p>FAA officials are tentatively planning to issue restrictions by Dec. 3, people familiar with the matter said. An FAA spokesman said the agency isn't \"in a position at the moment to discuss timing on any actions we may or may not take.\"</p><p>The FCC and FAA have said they are working closely together, and both said they are committed to ensuring public safety while advancing the latest broadband technology.</p><p>To resolve the impasse, the two agencies must work out a compromise. The FCC has allowed cellular service over the airwaves in question, known as C-band, and only its current leaders have the power to tweak those permissions. But if FAA officials aren't satisfied, they have their own power to issue safety warnings that could result in significant flight disruptions.</p><p>Cellphone carriers' 5G investments are meanwhile in limbo. A coalition of aerospace manufacturers and industry groups has asked the White House for an open-ended delay to get more detailed knowledge of wireless companies' network deployments.</p><p>Telecom companies say a longer wait is a nonstarter. They spent billions of dollars on acceleration payments to ready their spectrum for use within months instead of years. \"There is no scientific or engineering basis for further delay, and we cannot afford to fall behind,\" said the wireless companies' Washington-based trade group, CTIA. \"The wireless industry intends to launch this service in the U.S. next January.\"</p><p>The FAA's 2020 warning wasn't entered into the FCC's docket for public comments. If it had been, it could have prodded experts from both agencies and the industries they regulate to collaborate with more urgency, current and former government officials said. But a last-minute whiff of controversy could have hurt the price of the licenses the government was about to sell. \"It really is theft from these companies, not telling them the whole story,\" said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former Transportation Department official involved with writing the letter. \"If the FAA's administrator comes out and says there's danger to planes, that would depress the price.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, since President Biden took office, neither the FCC nor the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Commerce Department unit charged with brokering federal spectrum disputes, has had a permanent leader confirmed. The Senate on Wednesday will hold a confirmation hearing for Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC chairwoman, whose term is up for renewal. Alan Davidson, nominee for NTIA administrator, is also up for confirmation.</p><p>---</p><p>Micah Maidenberg and Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.</p>",
