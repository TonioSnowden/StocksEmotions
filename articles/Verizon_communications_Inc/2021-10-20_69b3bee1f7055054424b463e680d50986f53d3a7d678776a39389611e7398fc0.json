  "text": "<p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index bucked the trend, slipping 7.41 points, or about 0.1%, to 15121.68.</p><p>Investors are parsing corporate results for fresh insight into the effects of inflation and supply-chain disruptions. Shares of Verizon Communications climbed 2.4%, or $1.26, to $53.61 after the telecommunications giant raised its full-year outlook. Biogen fell 0.6%, or $1.56, to $266.57 even after the pharmaceutical company increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance.</p><p>Stocks have gained in recent days on strong earnings reports. Problems like labor shortages and higher prices for raw materials haven't eaten much into profits.</p><p>That is giving investors reason to look past supply-chain issues and seize on the strength of these corporations, said Carol Schleif, the deputy chief investment officer for BMO Family Office. What the numbers show, she said, is the resiliency of companies despite the unprecedented demands of the past year and a half. \"It's not something we step back and celebrate very often,\" she said.</p><p>For tech companies in particular, investors will be watching for updates on the global chip shortage and the ability of large firms to raise prices on consumers, said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>\"Earnings are very good so far across a pretty broad range\" of companies, Mr. Ganesh said.</p><p>Netflix shares fell 2.2%, or $13.86, to $625.14. The company said it added more new users than expected in the last quarter, but its co-chief executive also apologized for defending a controversial comedy special by Dave Chappelle.</p><p>Novavax fell 15%, or $23.69, to $136.86 after a report that the pharmaceutical company was running into difficulties manufacturing a Covid-19 vaccine that met regulators' quality standards.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.635%, up slightly from 1.634% Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>Higher bond yields make stocks less attractive, especially at their current rich valuations, Mr. Ganesh said. \"It undermines the 'no alternatives' argument for stocks if bonds start to yield something meaningful.\"</p><p>\"We're not near that point yet, but if we incrementally move up, investors will start to grow a little more concerned,\" he added.</p><p>Bitcoin hit a record, trading as high as $66,975, according to CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency has climbed more than 50% this month. The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund began trading Tuesday.</p><p>Oil prices reversed a morning selloff, and U.S. crude oil rose 1.1% to $83.87. That was its fifth straight gain and the highest settle value in seven years. Many traders are betting on energy supply shortages, which is pushing oil prices to multiyear highs.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.3%. Nestl√© shares climbed after the Swiss food giant upgraded its full-year sales outlook. Credit Suisse shares declined after the bank admitted to defrauding investors about a Mozambican deal. Also Tuesday, Switzerland's financial regulator said the bank's efforts to spy on executives were broader than previously known and broke supervisory law.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index edged down 0.2% to 3587.00, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 26136.02.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com</p><p>Dow, S&amp;P Finish Near Records</p>",
