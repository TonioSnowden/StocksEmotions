  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 882 points, or 2.6%, to 33,083, near the session's low of 33,016.16. The index was on track for its biggest daily drop since Sept. 13, when the Dow dropped more than 1,200 points for the first time since June 2020 as August inflation data rattled investors' confidence.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX dropped 109 points, or 2.7%, to 3,885 as the large-cap index also headed for its worst day since September.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP tumbled 375 points, or 3.4%, to 10,794, also on track for its worst day in months.</p><p>Stocks posted moderate losses Wednesday after the Federal Reserve delivered a half-point rate hike and signaled that rates would likely peak above 5% in 2023.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks saw losses deepen Thursday, a day after the Fed delivered a sobering assessment of its continuing inflation battleand as investors reacted to disappointing November retail sales.</p><p>The Federal Reserve hiked its interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday, with the benchmark rate projected to top out at 5.25%, higher than their September forecast of 4.75%. The stock indexes closed down on Wednesday afternoon after Fed's announcement, but well off their session lows.</p><p>Eric Merlis, managing director and co-head of global markets at Citizens, thinks Thursday's sharp selloff is what investors should have anticipated from Fed's rate hike and Chair Powell's news conference.</p><p>\"The market waited to hear what the European Central Bank and Bank of England had to say before getting a firmer commitment on an equity deal,\" Merlis told MarketWatch via phone.</p><p>Both the European Central Bank and Bank of England hiked their key lending rates by 50 basis points Thursday, but policy makers at the ECB emphasized that market participants should prepare for a series of rate hikes to come.</p><p>However, Merlis thinks the Fed's peak rate forecast of above 5% \"should have been completely expected\" by markets.</p><p>\"I thought [the terminal rate should be] somewhere between 5% and 5.5%. That's sort of where the Fed's standing right now, at least on the dots in the summary of economic projections,\" he said. \"I don't think they [Fed] 've signaled a pivot. I think they signaled continued willingness to look at data and reiterated that inflation is still too high.\"</p><p>See: 'The Fed is going to overdo it': Financial markets react to U.S. central bank's 2023 rate outlook and weak data</p><p>In economic data, sales at U.S. retailers fell by 0.6% in November, worse than the 0.3% contraction forecast from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal and the worst reading in more than a year.</p><p>Other data included weekly jobless claims and the Empire State manufacturing index, which declined to negative 11.2 in December. Meanwhile, Fed data showed industrial production fell 0.2% in November, the second straight monthly decline.</p><p>Thursday's retail sales report grabbed investors' attention as it showed that torrid inflation and rising borrowing costs appeared to finally be taking a toll on U.S. consumers.</p><p>\"The 0.6% m/m fall in retail sales in November suggests that the resilience of consumers to much higher interest rates is starting to crumble,\" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Hunter also pointed out that retail sales weakened in November \"despite the boost to real incomes from the continued sharp falls in gasoline prices in recent weeks, and suggests that higher borrowing costs, slower employment growth and an unusually low saving rate are now catching up with consumers.\"</p><p>Read: Powell paints hawkish picture at press conference</p><p>Stocks and other assets have vacillated between gains and losses this week as investors digested a raft of economic data and central bank rate hikes.</p><p>Concerns that the Fed might exacerbate job losses and a contraction in corporate profits by refusing to cut interest rates next year are again weighing on stocks.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve remains committed to taming inflation by keeping monetary policy tight, as Jerome Powell emphasized in his press conference, which is not great news for the stock market and supports the bear market continuing into 2023,\" said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research.</p><p>Single-stock movers</p><p>* Shares of both Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT and Marriott International Inc. MAR took a hit after a downgrade from Citigroup Inc. C analysts.
