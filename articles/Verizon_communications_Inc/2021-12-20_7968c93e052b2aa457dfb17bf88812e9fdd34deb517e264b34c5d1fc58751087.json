  "title": "Airlines Brace for  Flight Restrictions  Over 5G Rollout  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>   Airlines have begun planning for possible flight disruptions from a new fifth-generation cellular service slated to go live early next year, industry officials said. </p><p>   The early steps by airlines are a response to a Federal Aviation Administration order this month. The directive outlined potential restrictions on landing in bad weather in as many as 46 of the country's largest metropolitan areas, where the new wireless service is scheduled to roll out starting Jan. 5. </p><p>   The planning comes as U.S. regulators consider two proposals -- one from the telecom industry and another from the aviation industry -- for protecting aircraft from potential 5G interference with cockpit safety systems. Commonplace in modern air travel, they help planes land in poor weather, prevent crashes and avoid midair collisions. </p><p>   The wireless industry has said that the planned service poses no risk to aircraft, while the FAA has said it is worried that the frequencies the cellular signals use could possibly disrupt the cockpit systems. </p><p>   The airlines are in the middle of the dispute. \"If there's any kind of weather, if there's high winds, if the visibility isn't good because of smog, you can't use that equipment,\" United Airlines Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Scott Kirby told reporters Dec. 15. \"You can't land at airports -- at Chicago O'Hare, at Atlanta, at Detroit -- just think about what that means. This cannot be the outcome.\" </p><p>   As they game out various scenarios, airlines are awaiting specifics from the FAA about how broad or targeted the restrictions on landings might be -- and where -- starting Jan. 5, industry officials said. About a week before that date, the FAA is expected to issue pilot warnings specifying which airports will be subject to restrictions, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Air-safety regulators have been analyzing cell-tower and aircraft data to determine where 5G signals could potentially interfere with aircraft, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Despite the unknowns, airlines are assessing what canceled or diverted flights could mean for fuel, aircraft and crew needs, said George Paul, vice president for technical services at the National Air Carrier Association, which represents smaller cargo and passenger airlines. </p><p>   \"It's like a bad hurricane -- you don't know where it's going to hit until it actually gets a little closer,\" Mr. Paul said. </p><p>   The early planning by airlines is the result of a long-simmering conflict between U.S. telecom and aviation regulators, which have been working out of sync for more than a year. </p><p>   The Federal Communications Commission auctioned off portions of the 5G-friendly frequencies, also known as C-band, about a year ago. Top auction winners AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. were authorized to start offering some of the faster cellular service early this month, but the companies delayed their rollout until Jan. 5 to address the FAA's still-unresolved concerns. The companies also pledged to dim the power of C-band signals, especially near airport runways, for an additional six months. </p><p>   Flight limits could complicate the U.S. airline industry's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Domestic travel has bounced back, and airlines have been betting on a surge in demand for international flights in summer 2022. </p><p>   U.S. telecom industry officials have disputed claims about the new technology's safety risks. \"The aviation industry's fearmongering relies on completely discredited information and deliberate distortions of fact,\" said Nick Ludlum, a spokesman for the wireless industry group CTIA. \"We will launch this service in January with the most extensive set of protective measures in the world.\" </p><p>   Regulators are at odds over competing proposals from the U.S. aviation and telecom industries to limit the new 5G signals near airports. At a high-level meeting last Wednesday that included Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, officials discussed both industries' proposals to create buffer zones around airports, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Mr. Buttigieg requested that the FCC consider the aviation industry's proposal, some of these people said. FCC officials described that proposal as a nonstarter that would amount to a no-5G option, another person familiar with the meeting said. </p><p>   The FCC's Ms. Rosenworcel has said she believed officials would find a solution to allow 5G deployment swiftly and safely. \"I have confidence in the mitigations that have been offered up by the wireless industry,\" she said at a Dec. 14 press conference. </p><p>   An FAA spokesman said the regulator continues to work with other federal agencies and wireless companies so \"5G C-band and aviation can safely coexist.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alison Sider and Benjamin Katz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
