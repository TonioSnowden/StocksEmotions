  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Microsoft's Ties to China Won't End With LinkedIn Shutdown",
  "text": "<p>LinkedIn said it made the decision to shut down in China after \"facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements.\" Those same factors could lead Microsoft to pull out other products in China, said Paul Triolo, head of the global technology policy practice at Eurasia Group, a political-risk consulting firm.</p><p>\"What's the upside?\" he said. \"If you went into China hoping to see some liberalization around censorship 10 years ago, you were willing to be patient and establish a foothold. That calculus seems to not be getting better in the near term.\"</p><p>Weeks before LinkedIn announced its pullback from China, Microsoft was reminded by Beijing that it must follow rules in China. In September, Microsoft President Brad Smith spoke with Xiao Yaqing, the head of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, during which they spoke about Microsoft's expansion in China, according to a statement from the ministry.</p><p>Chinese officials want Microsoft to increase its investment in China's digital and automation industries but also want the company to comply with its regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment about LinkedIn's decision. It didn't respond to requests to comment about its meetings with Chinese officials.</p><p>Since opening an office in China in 1992, Microsoft has worked to get a foothold in the country. Despite setbacks, such as pirated software, the company has tried to take the long-term strategic view, former Microsoft China executives have said. China remains a small part of Microsoft's business, contributing less than 2% of its overall global sales, Mr. Smith said in September.</p><p>LinkedIn had some success in China, garnering more than 50 million users there, making it the website's third-largest market behind the U.S. and India.</p><p>For a social network like LinkedIn, international growth is often the biggest source of new user growth, said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which is an investor in Microsoft. Leaving China could result in a drop-off in revenue and subscriber growth, he said.</p><p>China has been tightening restrictions on tech in recent years, and LinkedIn has become a target along with other leading companies. In recent months, LinkedIn notified some China-focused human-rights activists and journalists that their profiles contained prohibited content and that they were being blocked in China.</p><p>When LinkedIn launched its China version in 2014, the company said it understood that it had to adhere to requirements of the Chinese government, but that it was worth the trade-off.</p><p>A tightening regulatory landscape governing algorithms, data collection and processing has heightened the challenges for Microsoft and other multinational corporations operating in China.</p><p>Chinese authorities introduced draft regulations overseeing the use of algorithmic recommendations this year. Once those rules are in effect, Microsoft's search engine Bing may have to tweak its algorithms, should regulators require them to do so after a review, said Carly Ramsey, head of the Greater China political and regulatory risk team at consulting firm Control Risks.</p><p>Bing, which launched in China in 2009, could be more sensitive to new restrictions, analysts said. It is a distant third in the search-engine market in China with a less than 4% market share, behind domestic search engine rivals Baidu, with an 82% share, and Sogou, with a more than 7% share, according to Statcounter.</p><p>Another growing business for Microsoft has been Teams, its videoconferencing and workplace-collaboration product. At the start of the pandemic, between late January and early March in 2020, Microsoft said it had seen a 500% increase in meetings, calls and conferences taking place via Teams in China.</p><p>Still, Microsoft faces tough competition in this area. Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. run popular videoconferencing tools in China.</p><p>Where Microsoft is unlikely to back down in China is in the company's core cloud business services, said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp.</p>",
