  "title": "Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg to Take Over Consumer Unit After Executive Exit; Consumer division leader Manon Brouillette departs after less than a year amid weak wireless subscriber growth",
  "text": "<p>Verizon remains the biggest U.S. cellphone carrier in terms of subscribers but has lost ground over the past two years in a three-way race with rivals AT&amp;T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. Growth in business customers barely made up for the company's consumer-division losses in the third quarter.</p><p>Verizon hired Ms. Brouillette in mid 2021 from Canadian telecom company Vid√©otron, where she served as chief executive. She took over Verizon's consumer wing in January 2022, succeeding executive Ronan Dunne.</p><p>Shares of the company fell about 2% mid-Monday. The stock is down 28% this year, compared with a 15% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index over the same span.</p><p>Mr. Vestberg has led the wireless company since 2018. An engineering-focused former chief of Swedish network-gear maker Ericsson AB, he sold off most of Verizon's interest in online media brands AOL and Yahoo and doubled down on infrastructure investments, including a record $45.5 billion to secure rights to wireless licenses suited for high-speed fifth-generation cellular service.</p><p>The company has long touted the quality of its wireless network as a selling point and in 2021 closed its purchase of TracFone, a collection of brands aimed at cost-conscious customers. But competitors including T-Mobile have gained market share over the past two years by promoting their own 5G services.</p><p>\"A lot of the network messaging is confusing to customers, and they're tuning it out,\" Roger Entner, chief of telecom-industry analysis company Recon Analytics. \"Verizon as the premium provider needs to demonstrate that differentiation clearly.\"</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg to Take Over Consumer Unit After Executive Exit</p>",
