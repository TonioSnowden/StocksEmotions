  "title": "FASB Again Aims for More Disclosure on Taxes From U.S. Companies; The U.S. accounting standard-setter floats its third such proposal in recent years despite past opposition from business",
  "text": "<p>Under Wednesday's proposal, both public and private companies would have to break out the income taxes paid to authorities at the federal, state and foreign levels for the year to date in both their quarterly and annual financial reports. If a particular jurisdiction represented more than 5% of these taxes for the year to date, businesses would need to specify that amount in their financial reports.</p><p>The proposal would also require public companies to share more detail on how they reconcile their domestic statutory rate with the rate they actually paid. Businesses would also have to present a table showing how categories such as state and local income taxes, foreign taxes, tax credits and the enactment of new tax laws contribute to the difference between the two rates—the statutory rate and the actual one—by providing the percentages and dollar amounts.</p><p>The FASB, which sets accounting standards for U.S. companies and nonprofits, has for at least six years weighed plans to require more disclosure on taxes, but has been \"unable to define a clear path forward,\" Chair Richard Jones said in May.</p><p>The first proposal came in 2016 and would have required companies to distinguish their U.S. from their foreign income taxes, among other changes.</p><p>In 2019, the standard-setter updated the proposal, requiring more disclosure. This time, it sought a breakout of the amount of federal, state and foreign taxes public companies paid, as well as disclosure on a quarterly basis. This proposal too failed to advance, in part because pandemic-related issues took priority.</p><p>Many companies have opposed the FASB's efforts to make them share an extensive breakdown of taxes across jurisdictions. Businesses are often wary of broad disclosure as it may invite scrutiny from investors and regulators.</p><p>Last year, cellphone carrier Verizon Communications Inc. asserted that existing disclosure requirements on pretax book income and current tax expenses \"provide sufficient detail for an investor to understand a company's tax profile,\" Mary-Lee Stillwell, vice president of accounting and external reporting, said in a letter to the FASB.</p><p>Biopharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. said additional disclosure on income taxes would lead to more confusion among investors, in part due to the complex nature of tax accounting and its intersection with tax initiatives and legislation that can dramatically alter future cash flows.</p><p>\"Taxes within global companies are extremely complex due to the number of jurisdictions and local laws, regulations and interpretations, varying tax rates and the tax systems that are involved,\" Jennifer Damico, Pfizer's controller, said in a letter last year to the FASB.</p><p>Verizon and Pfizer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.</p><p>In March, the FASB decided to revise the project to make it more investor-focused after shareholder feedback helped revive the process, Mr. Jones said in May. The project now primarily centers on income taxes paid and a rate-reconciliation table, as opposed to several other aspects of disclosure such as reserves for deferred tax assets and carry-overs of tax losses into future years.</p><p>\"When I first joined the board [in 2018], the project was more or less dead in the water and I think we've made huge strides here and I think it'll be very warmly received by investors,\" board member Gary Buesser said at the meeting Wednesday.</p><p>Compliance costs for companies would likely be lower under this proposal than previous iterations, in part because its scope is narrower, FASB Vice Chairman James Kroeker said.</p><p>The FASB expects to issue a formal proposal by late March and ask the public for feedback over a 75-day period, a spokeswoman said. Companies would have to provide the new income-tax disclosures for the prior-year period as well.</p><p>The new proposal comes as businesses with more than $1 billion in income would have to pay at least a 15% tax rate. The stipulation, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, is set to go into effect in January.</p><p>Accountants and investors have voiced concerns that the new law could politicize accounting rules, encouraging companies to distort their financial results. Mr. Jones has said the standard-setter could face political pressure to focus on raising tax revenue.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com</p><p>FASB Again Aims for More Disclosure on Taxes From U.S. Companies</p>",
