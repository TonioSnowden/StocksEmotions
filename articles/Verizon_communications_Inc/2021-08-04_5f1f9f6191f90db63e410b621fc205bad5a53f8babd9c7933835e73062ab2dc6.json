  "text": "<p>    Lumen Technologies Inc. plans to sell a swath of its U.S. telecommunications network to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $7.5 billion including debt, the companies said. </p><p>   The investment giant will carve out some of Lumen's so-called incumbent local exchange carrier assets, a collection of telephone and broadband infrastructure that covers more than 6 million residential and business customers across 20 states, mostly in the Midwest and Southeast.The deal value includes $1.4 billion of assumed debt. </p><p>   Lumen's remaining operations will focus on large business clients, which generate most of its revenue, as well as home-broadband subscribers in 16 states including Colorado, Florida and Washington. </p><p>   The new Apollo-backed company, which aims to accelerate the business's shift from older copper lines to high-speed fiber-optic technology, will be led by Verizon Communications Inc. veterans Bob Mudge, Chris Creager and Tom Maguire, who together built out Verizon's Fios service. </p><p>   Lumen Chief Executive Jeff Storey said the company is shifting its focus to consumer markets it considers good upgrade candidates for its own fiber business. </p><p>   The sale is the latest course change for Lumen, known as CenturyLink until its 2020 rebranding. CenturyLink was among the few remnants of the former AT&amp;T monopoly to survive into the 21st Century. In July, Lumen said it was selling its Latin American assets to Stonepeak Partners LP for $2.7 billion. </p><p></p>",
