Excluding that effect, the remaining company's revenue rose 4.7% to $38.1 billion.</p><p>AT&amp;T gave up a 30% stake and operational control of its U.S. pay-TV business to a joint venture with private-equity firm TPG in August, which skewed results in the full September quarter.</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>AT&amp;T Wireless's Gains Dwarf Shrinking Media Business</p>",
