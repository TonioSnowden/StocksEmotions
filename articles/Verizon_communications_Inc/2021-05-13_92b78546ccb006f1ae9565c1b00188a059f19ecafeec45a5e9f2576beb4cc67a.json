  "title": "BT Group: less content, more cash flow",
  "text": "<p>Pots — plain old telephone systems — have been panned by markets. As a result, telecom incumbents such as Britain's BT Group have sought to smarten up their image and lift share valuations. One gambit has been a shift into content. BT built its own sports network, focusing on European football. But there is a good reason operators have not converted into media companies.</p> <p>Full-year results from BT point to the squeeze the operator faces between spending on a promised full-fibre broadband rollout in the UK and finding new growth areas. BT Sport was supposed to be one, as pushed by former chief executive Gavin Patterson. But BT's plan to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0cc22bf-0c73-4c55-a35a-1459181833c1\">seek partners for BT Sport </a>highlights its financial struggle. Though deficits have narrowed in recent years, it has spent an estimated £2bn in cash to cover cumulative losses since 2013, according to Enders Analysis.</p> <p>The problem for telecom companies has been two-fold. Media projects require years of investment. But investors want steady cash flow and dividends. BT's shareholders, and its pension fund, have lodged this complaint regularly. An acceleration of its fibre broadband rollout, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a7ac45-b8e5-4aae-acce-f81e6d7d4dd2\">perhaps with partners</a>, will bring forward £3bn worth of investment by 2026. This has not consoled investors focused on cash flow. The share price fell 5 per cent on Thursday morning. </p> <p>In the US, Verizon also tried a shift towards media and advertising that turned out to be a mistake. It spent a total of $9bn on AOL and Yahoo only to dump them this month for about 40 per cent less. AT&amp;T fought for and won Time Warner, for $80bn, despite the US government's efforts to block the deal. Forward price-to-earnings ratios for both have shrunk to low double digits over the past five years. </p> <p>Successful production of content, drama or sport does not come cheap. Netflix's cumulative operating cash flow losses were $8.8bn in the four years to the end of 2019. Like BT, Disney has struggled with sports. Its network ESPN has shed more cable subscribers than any of its other channels. The ESPN Plus streaming venture looks small compared with Disney Plus. But moving into streaming, dependent on telecom networks, has boosted its earnings ratio, even accounting for earnings declines elsewhere in the group.</p> <p>BT's shareholders want less drama and more dividends. Moving away from expensive content would help with both. </p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice-weekly.
