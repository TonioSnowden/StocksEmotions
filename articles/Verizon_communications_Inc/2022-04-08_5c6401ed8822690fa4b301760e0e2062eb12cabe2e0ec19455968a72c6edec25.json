  "text": "<p>In fact, Jerry is physically present only briefly early on in the story and grievously diminished at that. Nonetheless, Ms. Ephron's account of one of their final conversations lets readers take his measure. She: Please forgive me for everything I've ever done to you. He: Everything?</p><p>Her husband's passing was something of a one-two punch. It came barely three years after Nora's death from acute myelogenous leukemia. The disease can run in families. In 2008, doctors noted some abnormal cells in Delia's own bone marrow, harmless at the time, perhaps harmless forever. There was no predicting.</p><p>Ms. Ephron dealt with the latest dose of grief in the way she knew best—by writing about it. Her op-ed for the New York Times about a pitched battle with Verizon to disconnect Jerry's landline struck a chord with readers. Among them was Peter Rutter, a San Francisco-based psychiatrist, widower and mensch. He and Delia, he told her in an email, had been fixed up by none other than Nora more than a half-century earlier. In fact, they'd had several dates. Ms. Ephron had no recollection. Dr. Rutter took no offense.</p><p>Thus was launched a correspondence that swiftly became a courtship. She met his family. He met her friends. He visited her in New York. She visited him in San Francisco. They learned about each other's temperaments. (He was an optimist, she a pessimist.) They learned about each other's quirks. (He was a planner who frequently changed plans; her mind could drift to the point that she missed entire conversations.) Then Ms. Ephron learned that she had leukemia.</p><p>In chapters that can be as terse as half a page, \"Left on Tenth\" chronicles a descent into the abyss and an arduous climb back up and out. Ms. Ephron writes with piercing acuity about her new identity—cancer patient—and its accoutrements: vein-implanted \"ports\" and PICC lines for IV infusions. The disease all but becomes a character. Then again, how could it be otherwise?</p><p>A new drug gets Ms. Ephron into remission, making possible a trip to Oregon with Peter to observe a solar eclipse—\"Is that underdog moon a metaphor of me versus the mighty leukemia?\"—then a trip to Wales. The ruins of Tintern Abbey, the inspiration for one of Wordsworth's best-known poems, are nearby. \"I fear I might be identifying with it, standing but decimated,\" she writes. \"My ability to take amazing phenomena—eclipses, falling-down ancient church—and relate them to myself is overblown and nearly preposterous but also evidence of how preoccupied I am with my fragile state.\" Somewhere in there, her beloved dog dies—of cancer.</p><p>When, within a few months, the \"mighty leukemia\" comes roaring back, a stem-cell transplant is the only option. The procedure is savage. For a time, Ms. Ephron wants to die. She almost does. Through it all Nora's ghost hovers. \"You are not your sister,\" the doctors remind Ms. Ephron over and over. Your marrow is different. Your outcome could be different.</p><p>But it's complicated. To tell herself that she's not like Nora \"seems almost a betrayal.\" When she's admitted to the same hospital that treated Nora, she thinks: \"Please don't put me in her room, please. How can I believe I am not my sister if I am in her room?\"</p><p>It says everything good about Ms. Ephron that she has lots of friends, wonderful supportive friends. But since they are referred to only by their first names—Heather, Lisa, Natasha, Julia, Kate, Jon, Alice, Meredith, Richard, Jessie—they become a confusing tangle to the reader. (The acknowledgments at the end of the book will clear things up for the curious.) And charming though Delia's and Peter's email exchanges may be, we get a few too many of them in their entirety.</p><p>It's hard not to tear up when Ms. Ephron, back among the living, decides that she's ready for a new dog, specifically a Havanese puppy named Charlotte. Feel free to call her something else, the breeder says. Absolutely not! Ms. Ephron thinks reflexively of the E.B. White children's classic \"Charlotte's Web\" and the arachnid valedictory that ends the book: \"It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both.\"</p><p>\"That is all I've aspired to,\" Ms. Ephron notes close to the end of her book. \"True friend and good writer.\" Done and done. \"Left on Tenth\" is the proof.</p><p>Ms. Kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the Journal.</p><p>'Left on Tenth' Review: She Didn't See That Coming</p>",
