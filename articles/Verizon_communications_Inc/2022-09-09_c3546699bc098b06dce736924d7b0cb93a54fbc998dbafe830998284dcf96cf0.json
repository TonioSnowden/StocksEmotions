Cook responded with a solution that Hunt should buy his mom an iPhone to fix the problem.</p><p>Read on: Here are the iPhone 14 deals from AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon as preorders begin</p><p>The comments from Cook comes as Apple introduced several new products this week at its \"Far Out\" event including the iPhone 14, new Apple watches and new Airpods.</p><p>The starting price ofiPhone 14 has stayed at $799 starting price and none of the new iPhone 14 devices, Apple said, and none of the new phones had a higher price relative to their iPhone 13 counterparts despite many analysts expecting Apple to raise costs amid high inflation.</p><p>See also: Inflation can't keep U.S. Open fans from Serena Williams and $22 cocktails</p><p>Shares of Apple Inc. were 1.04% higher during Friday morning's trading, and are down 12.11% year-to-date.</p><p>'Buy your mom an iPhone': Tim Cook says Apple doesn't prioritize texting experience between iPhones and Android</p>",
