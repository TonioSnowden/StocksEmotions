  "title": "Companies Betting Shoppers Shrug Off Inflation --- Makers of household staples say customers haven't been deterred by increases in prices",
  "text": "<p>Price increases so far have paid off for makers of household staples, as shoppers, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, have remained loyal to big-name brands.</p><p>Now companies are counting on customers to lift sales and offset higher costs that have stressed their bottom lines, even as broader inflationary pressures mount and some analysts question whether shoppers will start to seek cheaper alternatives.</p><p>\"We have not seen any material reaction from consumers,\" P&amp;G finance chief Andre Schulten said last week, referring to a string of price increases that went into effect in September. \"So that makes us feel good about our relative position.\"</p><p>Many consumers accumulated savings amid the pandemic and are benefiting from higher wages, leaving them with extra cash as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus keeps them home.</p><p>Companies benefiting from the dynamics have told investors to expect solid sales and profitability in 2022 even as rising costs tied to supply-chain woes show no signs of letting up.</p><p>The consumer-price index, which measures what consumers pay for goods and services, rose by 5.4% from a year earlier in September, matching its highest rate in over a decade. Many economists expect this stretch of inflation to linger.</p><p>\"As some of the stimulus fades and people start paying their rents, pricing is going to be more of an issue,\" said Nik Modi, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>Mr. Modi said big companies with well-known brands will more likely succeed in raising prices than budget or smaller brands because they are better able to keep products in stock and shoppers often see well-known names as a safer bet.</p><p>P&amp;G, maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, last week announced a third round of price increases, which will go into effect over the next few months, and told investors to expect profitability to accelerate as the year progresses.</p><p>Nestle, the world's largest packaged-food company, raised its full-year guidance for the second-straight quarter, as consumers continued to drink more and better coffee at home even as pandemic restrictions ease.</p><p>Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said price increases haven't turned people off its burritos. Higher menu prices helped net income more than double in the most recent quarter, compared with a year before, despite higher labor and commodity costs.</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon, the nation's top cellphone carriers, both told investors that their revenue growth would pick up this year partly by persuading users to trade up to premium plans bundled with streaming-media subscriptions or other perks like low-cost iPhones.</p><p>Analysts questioned whether Nestle's confidence in demand for pricey coffee is overblown. Others wondered if P&amp;G's market-share gains will erode or reverse as more of its price increases kick in.</p><p>Both companies reiterated their confidence. Nestle said its coffee category is its biggest contributor to growth. P&amp;G said investments the company has made into higher-quality products with new features will keep consumers paying higher prices even if household budgets tighten.</p><p>\"I don't see what else we can do besides just paying it,\" said Lawrence Tam, 43 years old, of Houston. He said the cost of bacon has doubled recently at his local grocery. But Mr. Tam, who runs a ketogenic diet group, said that while he has begun seeking out discounted meat, he and his wife aren't likely to make major changes on other household items.</p><p>---</p><p>Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
