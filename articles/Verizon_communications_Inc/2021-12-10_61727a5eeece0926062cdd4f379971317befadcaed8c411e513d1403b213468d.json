  "title": "Reluctant Advertising Woman Reached Top of Her Trade; Laurel Cutler, who has died at age 94, was a Wellesley philosophy major who wanted to write novels but ended up advising top executives at the likes of Chrysler and Campbell Soup",
  "text": "<p>Searching through an Italian-English dictionary, she spotted \"prego\" and declared it the ideal name for a pasta sauce created by Campbell Soup Co. Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca was so impressed with her branding insights that he appointed her vice president for consumer affairs at the auto maker in 1988, though she didn't have a driver's license. That Chrysler job briefly made her nearly as prominent as her older brother, Lloyd Cutler, a lawyer who advised both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Starting in the late 1970s, she projected that bland, midprice brands aimed at the mass market were doomed. People would no longer be exclusively upscale, middle-tier or downscale in their buying decisions, she said in an interview with Inc. magazine: \"The very same people would buy at Neiman-Marcus in the morning and Kmart in the afternoon, depending on whether they cared about the category or not.\"</p><p>Her advice to product developers was succinct: \"Delight the few, attract the many.\"</p><p>Ms. Cutler, who died Nov. 28 at the age of 94, was frequently quoted in The Wall Street Journal, partly because she could be relied upon for a strong opinion, expressed concisely. In 1990, she told the Journal that automotive advertising aimed solely at women was \"patronizing and condescending.\"</p><p>A car tire maker once showed her a pink tire designed to appeal to women. She informed the client that women were looking for safety and reliability from their tires, not bright colors.</p><p>Ms. Cutler believed in her hunches and observations—and scoffed at those who relied too heavily on data to predict trends. \"There is no data on the future,\" she said.</p><p>Laurel Eve Cutler was born Dec. 8, 1926, in New York City. Her father, Aaron Smith Cutler, was a trial lawyer and partner of Fiorello La Guardia (who served as mayor in the 1930s and '40s). Her mother, Dorothy Glaser Cutler, had graduated from Hunter College with a math degree. It was, Ms. Cutler wrote later, a \"high-achieving family.\"</p><p>As a child, Laurel was a radio performer, singing on a children's hour and competing on a quiz show. At age 15, she enrolled at Wellesley, where she was later voted the \"second wittiest\" in her class. Her professors included Vladimir Nabokov.</p><p>Ms. Cutler wrote an unpublished novel and, after graduating, briefly was a reporter for the Washington Post. \"There were no jobs for philosophy majors,\" she found, \"and damn few for English majors.\" So she took a position at the ad agency J. Walter Thompson, which assigned her to write press handouts for radio and television shows.</p><p>When a personnel manager asked Ms. Cutler what her lifetime ambition was, she replied, \"I want to be a good wife and mother.\" Even so, the manager prodded her into entering a contest for aspiring writers of ad copy. \"Because I didn't stress that much over it,\" she wrote, \"I won the copy competition.\"</p><p>That put her on track for increasing creative responsibilities at ad agencies. She worked at McCann-Erickson before being recruited by a smaller rival, Leber Katz Partners, where she rose to vice chairman and became known for her forecasting work.</p><p>Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc. acquired Leber Katz in 1986. She remained employed by Foote Cone's Leber Katz unit while working for Chrysler from late 1988 through 1990, shuttling between offices in Detroit and New York.</p><p>She advised Chrysler to concentrate on pleasing customers rather than car dealers. Lunches in the executive dining rooms could be trying: \"They were all car guys,\" she wrote, \"and I emphatically was not.\"</p><p>At various times, she served on the boards of True North Communications Inc., the parent of Foote Cone; the ad agency Fallon McElligott; Quaker State Corp., a maker of motor oil; and Hannaford Bros. Co., a grocery chain.</p><p>Her marriage to Stanley Bernstein, a lawyer, ended in divorce. She later married Theodore Israel, who died in 2015.</p><p>Her three children followed the high-achieving tradition. Amy Bernstein is editor of Harvard Business Review. Seth P. Bernstein is chief executive of AllianceBernstein, a fund manager. Jonathan Bernstein owns Body Back Co., a supplier of massage tools. Ms. Cutler also is survived by six grandchildren and a great granddaughter.</p><p>In a 1987 interview with Inc., she offered this advice to brand managers: \"We must help our customers find something to hang onto—to sink roots into. One hundred percent quality, real service, unique design, style—these are the product values that deliver the human values that never change: love, pride, joy, the family, self-esteem.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
