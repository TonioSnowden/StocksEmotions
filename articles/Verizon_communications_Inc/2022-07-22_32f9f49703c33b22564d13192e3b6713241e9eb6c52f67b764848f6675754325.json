  "title": "Verizon stock heads for steepest drop in more than two years as inflation and competition hit earnings; Results come in the wake of a mixed report from peer AT&T, which lowered its free-cash-flow outlook",
  "text": "<p>Verizon VZ lowered its outlook for the full year and now expects 8.5% to 9.5% wireless service revenue growth as well as $5.10 to $5.25 in earnings per share.</p><p>During its first-quarter report, Verizon said that it anticipated coming in toward the \"lower end\" of the guidance ranges it gave previously for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. Those guidance ranges called for 9% to 10% revenue growth as well as $5.40 to $5.55 in adjusted EPS.</p><p>\"We believe Verizon is incurring a greater cost of promotions to manage its volume objectives, while inflationary cost pressures are likely greater than we previously anticipated,\" Citi Research analyst Michael Rollins wrote following the report.</p><p>The company logged 12,000 total postpaid phone net additions in the latest quarter but noted that it had 215,000 such wireless losses in its consumer business. Verizon saw consumer wireless retail postpaid phone churn come in at 0.93%.</p><p>\"The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior,\" Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said on the earnings call, according to a transcript from Sentieo. \"And we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our gross adds.\"</p><p>He discussed that Verizon \"adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our unlimited offerings.\" Vestberg expects such actions to drive \"improved performance\" later this year and into 2023.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis offered on the call that \"the pricing actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022\" but \"this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds.\"</p><p>MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett commented that Verizon has been taking the \"high road\" on pricing \"by absorbing slower, or even negative, subscriber growth in order to preserve industry economics.\"</p><p>The latest results indicate to him that the strategy isn't working, as the company fell short on profit while cutting the forecast across the board.</p><p>\"In the wake of AT&amp;T's strong-subscribers-and-poor-free-cash-flow report yesterday, it is clear that Verizon's invitation to the rest of the industry to join them on the high road is falling on deaf ears,\" he wrote. \"Making matters worse is the fact that Verizon's subscribers are self-selected to be the industry's most demanding,\" prompting questions about whether they'll stick with the network now that T-Mobile US is seen as better positioned in 5G.</p><p>The company posted second-quarter net income of $5.32 billion, or $1.24 a share, compared with $5.94 billion, or $1.40 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. On an adjusted basis, Verizon notched earnings per share of $1.31, down from $1.37 a year before, and a penny below the FactSet consensus, which was for $1.32. Verizon said earnings for the latest quarter included a $435 million pre-tax loss from special items.</p><p>Verizon's revenue came in at $33.8 billion, roughly flat with a year earlier, whereas analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $33.7 billion.</p><p>The results came after peer AT&amp;T Inc. T delivered a mixed report a day earlier. AT&amp;T saw strong growth in its postpaid phone net additions and signaled that pricing changes were having a positive effect, but management also pointed to some changing consumer behaviors in the wake of deteriorating economic conditions, and the company lowered its free-cash flow outlook.</p><p>Read: AT&amp;T earnings were 'actually good' despite stock selloff, says analyst</p><p>AT&amp;T disclosed that some customers were becoming slower with their phone payments in light of the economy, one factor that contributed to the reduced free-cash forecast. Customers are taking longer to pay, but there hasn't been a \"material step-up\" relative to before the pandemic, AT&amp;T's investor-relations head Amir Rozwadowski told MarketWatch.</p><p>At the same time, AT&amp;T also indicated that wasn't seeing bad-debt expenses materially higher than they were before the pandemic, indicating to management that the company expected customers to still pay their bills even if it was a bit more slowly than AT&amp;T had grown used to during healthier economic times last year.</p><p>Verizon handled the question a bit differently when executives were asked if they were observing similar effects to what AT&amp;T highlighted.</p><p>\"We haven't seen any noticeable change in the payment patterns from customers,\" Ellis said on the company's earnings call. He added that the patterns were \"very much in line with what we were seeing pre-COVID, in fact, slightly better than that time period.\"</p><p>Shares of Verizon have lost 8% over the past three months as the S&amp;P 500 SPX has dropped 6%.</p><p>Verizon stock heads for steepest drop in more than two years as inflation and competition hit earnings</p>",
