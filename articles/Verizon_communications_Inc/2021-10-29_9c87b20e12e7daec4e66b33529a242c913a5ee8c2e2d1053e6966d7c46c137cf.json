Some investors put their money into Zoom Technologies last year, sending the stock higher, instead of investing into popular work-from-home videoconferencing service Zoom Video Communications Inc. It didn't help that Zoom Technologies' ticker was ZOOM.</p><p>The same thing happened when individual investors were excited about movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Shares of AMC Networks Inc., which has a similar ticker to AMC Entertainment, also rose. AMC Networks is an entertainment company whose brands include AMC and IFC.</p><p>Facebook announced its name changeon Thursday as it faces scrutiny from lawmakers, users and researchers. The Wall Street Journal recently published a series of investigative articlesdetailing how the company knew its platforms were harmful in some ways and didn't fix them.</p><p>Meta Materials, meanwhile, is different. The Nova Scotia-based company has a technology platform to help brands with products in areas such as 5G communications and consumer electronics.</p><p>From Facebook to Meta</p><p>* Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Pivot Is Personal as Well as Strategic</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Facebook's Four New Letters Won't Spell Alphabet</p><p>* Facebook Changes Company Name to Meta in Focus on Metaverse</p><p>* MVRS, Facebook's New Ticker Symbol, Leaves FAANG in Flux</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Meta Shares Surge.
