  "title": "Comcast Subscriber Growth Is Flat --- Revenue gains as movie-studio and theme-park divisions rebound after Covid",
  "text": "<p>Comcast had 32.16 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter, the same number it had at the end of the first.</p><p>Competition for internet-service customers has intensified in recent years, with AT&amp;T Inc. building out its fiber-broadband footprint and wireless carriers such as T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. offering 5G services that can be used as a substitute to a traditional broadband connection, analysts said.</p><p>\"Mobile substitution will eventually stabilize,\" CEO Brian Roberts said on a call with investors Thursday.</p><p>A review of the company's quarterly filings shows that Comcast added at least 100,000 net new broadband subscribers every quarter over the past 20 years, with the exception of a single instance during the 2008-09 financial crisis, when the company gained 65,000 broadband subscribers in the second quarter of 2009.</p><p>Comcast shares fell 9.1%, or $3.96, to close at $39.41.</p><p>Overall, the company said net profit declined 9.2% to $3.4 billion, or 76 cents a share, from $3.74 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 5.1% to $30.02 billion.</p><p>The number of paying subscribers to its Peacock streaming service remained stable at around 13 million, Comcast said. The company's Universal Studios theme-park business reported $1.8 billion in revenue, a 65% increase from the previous year. Its movie studios-unit posted a 33% increase in revenue to nearly $3 billion, driven by the successful theatrical release of \"Jurassic World: Dominion.\"</p><p>Overall, NBCUniversal -- the Comcast division that comprises theme parks, the movie studio, Peacock and TV stations including NBC -- had revenue of $9.45 billion, up 19% from a year earlier.</p><p>Comcast's U.K.-based Sky unit suffered from the loss of rights to Italian soccer league Serie A. Revenue declined nearly 14% to $4.5 billion, and it lost 255,000 customers during the second quarter.</p><p>Revenue at Comcast's cable unit -- which includes the Xfinity-branded broadband, cable-TV, and mobile businesses -- rose 3.7% to $16.6 billion, and continued to make up the bulk of Comcast's overall revenue.</p>",
