  "text": "<p>   Cellphone carriers that are facing roughly $200 million in fines for sharing their customers' locations are for now shielded from paying by the Federal Communications Commission's partisan deadlock, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The U.S. telecom regulator currently has four commissioners -- two Democrats and two Republicans -- and needs at least three votes to move forward with fines it proposed years ago on the biggest wireless service providers. </p><p>   FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, in August circulated four forfeiture orders penalizing AT&amp;T Inc., Sprint, T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. for allegedly mishandling access to the real-time whereabouts of their subscribers, the people said. The commission has yet to publish the forfeiture orders. </p><p>   The FCC can't issue the orders without approval from at least three commissioners. The two Democrats on the commission have voted to approve the fines while their Republican counterparts have yet to vote, the people said. </p><p>   The FCC first outlined the penalties for cellphone carriers in early 2020 under then-Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican. Democratic and Republican commissioners voiced support for the move. </p><p>   The commission probed the cellphone carriers following public reports that data brokers with access to subscribers' real-time locations were sharing that information with dozens of third-party companies that allegedly mishandled the data. </p><p>   The penalties remained in limbo until August, when Ms. Rosenworcel moved to enforce them. </p><p></p>",
