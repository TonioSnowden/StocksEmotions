  "title": "Small Business (A Special Report)  ---  How to Get More Women Into Technology:  All sorts of programs try to steer women into STEM fields. Here are some that are working.  ----  By Jillian Berman",
  "text": "<p>   During her decadeslong career in technology, Judith Spitz watched as the \"dismal number\" of women in the industry failed to budge. In 2016, she decided to do something about it. </p><p>   That year, Dr. Spitz founded Break Through Tech at Cornell Tech in New York City, an initiative aimed at increasing the number of women in computer science and tech careers. By using a mix of methods -- including setting up internship arrangements that better suited the students' strengths -- the program saw strong results: Today, about 50% of its participants win summer internships, up from 5% at the start. </p><p>   Break Through Tech is one of several recent efforts that are making headway against a longstanding problem: boosting the small number of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM. These programs attack the problem in a number of different ways. They are giving students enrichment programs, setting them up with female mentors as role models, grounding their course work in real-world problems to keep it relevant -- and sometimes, like Break Through Tech, mediating with potential employers. </p><p>   Beyond that, many of the programs are looking to change something even more fundamental -- how girls are taught science and even how they view themselves. </p><p>   \"Our education system is simply not set up to close the gender gap in tech,\" says Tarika Barrett, chief executive officer of the training and advocacy group Girls Who Code. </p><p>   STEM fields are some of the fastest-growing and most lucrative, and increasing the number of women in their ranks would likely have big implications for the economy, the products these firms develop and, of course, the women themselves. </p><p>   Despite some gains, though, progress for women has been slow in many areas. In computer science, it has reversed. The share of women awarded bachelor's degrees in computer science declined to 19.9% in 2018 from 27% in 1998, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics within the National Science Foundation. </p><p>   The data are even more troubling for women of color. Black women made up just 2.4% of computer-science bachelor's degree recipients in 2018, down from 3.6% in 2008. In engineering, they accounted for 1.1% of bachelor's degrees awarded, down from 1.4% in 2008. </p><p>   \"We've got issues that go from right when a girl enters pre-K all the way into senior leadership roles in STEM fields,\" says Kim Churches, chief executive of the American Association of University Women, a nonprofit advocating for women and girls' equity. </p><p>   Break Through Tech's initial efforts to deal with the problem centered on women attending the City University of New York. The organization sought to increase the number of students hired for summer internships, which are key to landing a full-time job in the industry. </p><p>   The employers seemed eager to participate, says Dr. Spitz, formerly Verizon's chief information officer. Her organization \"tried to act as a concierge facilitator\" helping to introduce companies that had indicated an interest in hiring CUNY students to those students, studying just a subway ride away. </p><p>   \"After two summers of doing that, we observed that a pathetically small number of students were actually landing those coveted tech summer internships,\" Dr. Spitz says. </p><p>   The problem, the organization realized based on conversations with the companies' hiring managers, was that although the companies had said they were interested in recruiting more students from CUNY, the eligibility criteria for the internships didn't match students' experience. </p><p>   That is because students at CUNY are more likely to come from low-income households than those at institutions where technology companies have historically recruited. Instead of participating in weekend hackathons or other activities that resume screeners were used to encountering, these students may have had to work. </p><p>   The answer was short, paid internships, called Sprinternships, during an academic recess, usually students' winter break. That allowed the companies to get to know the students without the level of commitment required for a summer internship. </p><p>   Instead of going through the typical internship interview process, Break Through Tech collects data on the students, such as their course work, extracurricular activities and the sector they are interested in. It plugs this information into an algorithm that matches the students with companies based on what, if any, technical skills they are looking for. </p><p>   More than 1,000 young women have participated in the program so far -- and now, more than 50% go on to land summer internships after the shorter ones during other times of the year. </p><p>   Other efforts try to address how girls are taught -- and treated in the classroom. During early elementary school, girls and boys are equally interested in science and math, but that starts to diverge some time in late elementary school, says Nilanjana Dasgupta, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies implicit bias. </p><p>   \"The obstacles are not about ability,\" she says. \"It's more about there are some things that are impeding girls' interest and confidence that they're good at it.\" </p><p>   There is evidence that the messaging girls receive from parents, guidance counselors, teachers and society more broadly may be part of what's getting in the way of that interest. Nicole M. Joseph, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of Education and Human Development has found that teachers' perceptions of Black girls, in particular, can be an obstacle to them developing a math identity -- an interest in math as well as being recognized for being good at it. </p><p>   Jakita O. Thomas is tackling those issues, trying to transform how computing is taught and push the field to value the experiences of people from a variety of backgrounds, so that it is more equitable for Black women and other historically marginalized groups. </p><p>   In 2013, Dr. Thomas, Philpott Westpoint Stevens associate professor of computer science and software engineering at Auburn University, began working with a group of 23 Black girls during the summer before sixth grade as part of a free enrichment program focused on game design. </p><p>   Throughout the program, which continued through 12th grade, the girls spent weeks in the summer designing games to address social issues and participated in technical workshops during the academic year. The girls also took field trips to learn about ways they could apply their computing knowledge to careers. </p><p>   In addition, everyone who came in to teach an element of the program was a Black woman in the field. </p><p>   \"Oftentimes, a lot of Black women don't know another Black woman that's in computing,\" Dr. Thomas says. </p><p>   Now the girls are young women, and only one of them isn't pursuing a STEM major in college. </p><p>   Girls Who Code also tries to support female students with extracurricular activities. In addition to teaching coding and other computing skills, the group's summer immersion programs and 8,500 after-school clubs feature experiences designed to build leadership and foster community. </p><p>   Alumnae of the program are majoring in computer science at 15 times the average rate for women in college, according to Girls Who Code. The organization continues to support alumnae through college, an effort it ramped up during the pandemic. </p><p>   The transition into college can be an important period for ensuring young women stay on track toward a STEM career. Dr. Dasgupta's research has found that women pursuing engineering in college were more likely to stick with the major beyond year one if they were assigned a female peer mentor than a male peer mentor or no mentor at all. </p><p>   In addition, research indicates that changing the way introductory science courses are taught in college could help to better retain students from underrepresented backgrounds. Cara Gormally, an associate professor of biology in the School of Science, Technology, Accessibility, Mathematics, and Public Health at Gallaudet University, is developing a curriculum for introduction to biology based on these insights. </p><p>   Often, introductory biology courses are structured as a \"march through content with no connection of why you should care about it,\" she says. </p><p>   Instead, Dr. Gormally's course, which she's developing with a colleague at the University of Georgia, will look at topics like how antidepressants work and whether you should participate in genetic testing. </p><p>   Ultimately, to increase the share of women working and staying in high-paying technology, science and engineering fields, employers will also have to make changes. </p><p>   As part of Girls Who Code's work, Dr. Barrett says its leaders are having conversations with corporate partners about these issues. </p><p>   \"We've managed to build this amazing pipeline,\" she says. \"We have so many girls and women who are interested, we see a lot of young women enter the field and leave it.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch.
