  "text": "<p>Lumen's remaining operations will focus on large business clients, which generate most of its revenue, as well as home-broadband subscribers in 16 states including Colorado, Florida and Washington.</p><p>The new Apollo-backed company, which aims to accelerate the business's shift from older copper lines to high-speed fiber-optic technology, will be led by Verizon Communications Inc. veterans Bob Mudge, Chris Creager and Tom Maguire, who together built out Verizon's Fios service.</p><p>Lumen Chief Executive Jeff Storey said the company is shifting its focus to consumer markets it considers good upgrade candidates for its own fiber business.</p><p>The sale is the latest course change for Lumen, known as CenturyLink until its 2020 rebranding. CenturyLink was among the few remnants of the former AT&amp;T monopoly to survive into the 21st Century. In July, Lumen said it was selling its Latin American assets to Stonepeak Partners LP for $2.7 billion.</p>",
