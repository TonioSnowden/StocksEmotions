  "text": "<p>Charter is facing some of the same problems as its competitors, including cord-cutting and the decline of its video business, said Joseph Bonner, a senior securities analyst at investment research firm Argus Research Group. Part of those losses are offset by the growth in its broadband business, he said. \"The challenges are on the operational side, in terms of running the business as effectively as possible,\" Mr. Bonner said.</p><p>Ms. Fischer will likely focus on continuing to expand the broadband business, for example by investing in network upgrades to maintain a competitive advantage over telecommunications rivals AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., said Vijay Jayant, a senior managing director at investment bank Evercore ISI.</p><p>Charter said it added 299,000 residential customers during the quarter ended June 30, down from 751,000 added in the prior-year period, when many people worked from home due to Covid-19 restrictions. Charter's revenue grew 9.5% to $12.8 billion during the quarter compared with the prior-year period. Its net income attributable to shareholders rose 33.2% to $1.02 billion from a year ago.</p><p>The company said Mr. Bickham, who has been president since 2016 and chief operating officer since 2012, will now serve as vice chairman until his retirement, which was announced in February.</p><p>Charter's longtime CFO Mr. Winfrey succeeds Mr. Bickham as COO. Rich DiGeronimo, its chief product and technology officer, will take on added oversight of the company's network operations.</p><p>\"Jessica's leadership and financial expertise has benefited Charter for many years, both in her roles at Charter and while at EY where she was a key advisor during our 2016 transactions,\" Thomas Rutledge, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, referring to Charter's acquisition of Time Warner Cable. \"In this role, Jessica will have an even greater impact on Charter's success as we continue to seize the many opportunities before us.\"</p><p>The company's financial strategy isn't expected to change under Ms. Fischer or the other executives entering new roles, Mr. Jayant said. \"If you were part of this strategy, then you understand it,\" he said. \"It's a continuum of what they've been doing already.\"</p><p>As CFO, Ms. Fischer is set to receive an annual base salary of $700,000, a target annual bonus opportunity of 150% of her salary and participation in employee benefit plans, according to a regulatory filing.</p><p>A spokesman declined to comment beyond the company's announcement.</p><p>Nina Trentmann contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com and Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Charter Appoints New CFO, Fills Other Top Roles in Management Shuffle</p>",
