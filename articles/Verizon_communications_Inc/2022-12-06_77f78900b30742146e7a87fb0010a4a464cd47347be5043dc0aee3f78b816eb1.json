  "title": "Business News:  Verizon Consumer  Unit Head Exits,  CEO Takes Over  ----  By Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>    Verizon Communications Inc. replaced consumer unit chief Manon Brouillette after a little less than a year in the role, the latest sign of the wireless company's struggle to appeal to nonbusiness clients. </p><p>   The cellphone carrier said Monday that Chief Executive Hans Vestberg, 57, would assume the immediate responsibilities of Ms. Brouillette, 54.  Mr. Vestberg said in a statement that he would focus \"on driving a closer consistency between the top quality network product we're bringing to market and the operational results we're producing.\" </p><p>   Verizon remains the biggest U.S. cellphone carrier in terms of subscribers but has lost ground over the past two years in a three-way race with rivals AT&amp;T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. Growth in business customers barely made up for the company's consumer-division losses in the third quarter. </p><p>   Verizon hired Ms. Brouillette in mid 2021 from Canadian telecom company Videotron, where she served as chief executive. </p><p>   She took over Verizon's consumer wing in January 2022, succeeding executive Ronan Dunne. </p><p>   Shares of the company fell 2.9% Monday. </p><p>   The stock is down 29% this year, compared with a 16% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index over the same span. </p><p>   Mr. Vestberg has led the wireless company since 2018. An engineering-focused former chief of Swedish network-gear maker Ericsson AB, he sold off most of Verizon's interest in online media brands AOL and Yahoo and doubled down on infrastructure investments, including a record $45.5 billion to secure rights to wireless licenses suited for high-speed fifth-generation cellular service. </p><p>   The company has long touted the quality of its wireless network as a selling point and in 2021 closed its purchase of TracFone, a collection of brands aimed at cost-conscious customers. </p><p>   But competitors including T-Mobile have gained market share over the past two years by promoting their own 5G services. </p><p>   \"A lot of the network messaging is confusing to customers, and they're tuning it out,\" Roger Entner, chief of telecom-industry analysis company Recon Analytics. \"Verizon as the premium provider needs to demonstrate that differentiation clearly.\" </p><p></p>",
