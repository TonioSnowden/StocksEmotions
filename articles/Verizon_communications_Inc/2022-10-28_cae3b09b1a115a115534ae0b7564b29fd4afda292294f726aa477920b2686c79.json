  "title": "Business News:  T-Mobile's Subscriber  Gains Outpace Rivals,  Yearly Forecast Raised  ----  By Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>   T-Mobile US Inc. said its cost and customer trends had improved heading into the end of 2022 after the company logged its strongest jump in core phone subscriptions since its merger with Sprint Corp. </p><p>   The cellphone carrier reported a net gain of 854,000 postpaid phone connections during the recent quarter, a postmerger record that outpaced both AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. The tally topped the average estimate of 725,000 from analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>   T-Mobile's shares climbed about 3% after hours Thursday to $145. </p><p>   T-Mobile said total net customer additions under postpaid plans would hit 6.2 million to 6.4 million for the year, up from its earlier 6 million to 6.3 million target. The positive projections represented T-Mobile's third target increase this year. </p><p>   AT&amp;T added 708,000 such customers and raised its projected full-year profit, a sign its customers were still willing to spend heavily on new smartphones with expensive data plans. Verizon, the largest of the three U.S. wireless network operators, posted an 8,000-phone increase in the category. </p><p>   T-Mobile's customer gains have led the wireless industry for most of the past two years. The Sprint merger helped the combined company cut its construction and tower-leasing costs and led to widespread layoffs over the past two years. </p><p>   T-Mobile expects savings and benefits from its 2020 purchase of Sprint to reach between $5.7 billion and $5.8 billion this year, up from its earlier $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion target. </p><p>   T-Mobile's overall profit fell to $508 million, or 40 cents a share, from $691 million a year earlier, or 55 cents. The earnings result included $972 million of merger-related costs and an expected $803 million loss in the quarter from the sale of the company's wireline network to Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. for $1. </p><p>   Total revenue slipped 0.7% to $19.48 billion despite higher revenue from wireless service. Finance chief Peter Osvaldik said the decline reflected dwindling leased smartphone plans under Sprint accounts, which generate sales but don't contribute to the service revenue that powers company profits. </p><p></p>",
