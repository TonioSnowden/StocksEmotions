  "text": "<p>Rival online video packages from Sony Corp. and others have shut operations or raised prices on live-TV service to keep up with programmers that continue to raise fees.</p><p>T-Mobile launched a remade version of its TV service last year to cater to its base of wireless customers -- the country's second-largest, after Verizon Communications Inc. It also targeted existing cable subscribers and the millions of U.S. households that have dropped TV subscriptions from their bills, opting instead to buy broadband-internet service as a stand-alone item and sign up for a panoply of video services such as Netflix and Disney+.</p><p>The new product was designed to supplement T-Mobile's home broadband-internet service, which is scheduled to open up to the general public later this year.</p><p>Virtual pay-TV services delivered entirely online have struggled to break through. AT&amp;T Inc.'s offering -- a service originally launched as DirecTV Now, which delivers channels over the internet without a satellite -- has shrunk since peaking at nearly two million subscribers in 2018. PlayStation Vue, a TV service from Sony, shut down last year.</p><p>TVision was the cellphone carrier's second attempt at entering the pay-TV industry, after its 2018 purchase of Layer3 TV for $325 million. The company has spent the past two years piecing together the rights to carry enough traditional live-TV channels to compete with its bigger cable-TV rivals. T-Mobile wrote down most of Layer3's value last year, citing a new strategy based partly on recently acquired content rights.</p><p>Live TV is one of several sweeteners T-Mobile has offered its core base of cellphone customers in recent years.</p><p>Past promotions have bundled Netflix and the now-defunct Quibi service with customers' wireless bills.</p>",
