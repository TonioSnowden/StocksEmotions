  "text": "<p>The vote follows a successful unionization push in June at an Apple Store in Towson, Md., a suburb of Baltimore. Those employees joined the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. At an Atlanta retail location, organizers withdrew a petition to vote on unionization in May.</p><p>More U.S. companies have faced unionization efforts over the past year, including at Starbucks Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. Thousands of Amazon.com Inc. employees at a Staten Island, N.Y., warehouse voted to unionize in April, and workers at a facility in upstate New York are voting in a union election this month.</p><p>Unions are pushing to grow as companies struggle with labor shortages and workers demand more from their employers. Private-sector union membership has been facing a long-term decline. A record low of 6.1% of workers were members of a union in the private sector in 2021, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Workers Vote for Union at Oklahoma Store in Second Organizing Win</p>",
