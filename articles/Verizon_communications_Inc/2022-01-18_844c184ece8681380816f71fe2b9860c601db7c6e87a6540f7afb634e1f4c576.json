  "title": "Airlines  Warn of  Disruption  Over 5G  ----  By Alison Sider and Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>   The chief executives of major passenger and cargo airlines said there could be significant flight disruptions when new 5G service goes live in the U.S. this week, unless implementation of the wireless service within 2 miles of major airport runways is delayed. </p><p>   The outlook had worsened for flight disruptions from the planned rollout of new high-speed wireless services, the airline executives said Monday in a letter to U.S. officials. </p><p>   The executives asked that officials \"take whatever action necessary to ensure that 5G is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the FAA can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption.\" The letter was addressed to several Biden administration officials including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administration head Steve Dickson. </p><p>   AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. had planned to roll out the faster wireless internet service in early December. The plan hit hurdles after aviation regulators said they would need to implement flight restrictions to protect air traffic from the \"C-band\" frequencies that will carry the fifth-generation service. </p><p>   Spokespeople for the two cellphone carriers declined to comment Monday. Wireless operator T-Mobile US Inc. isn't immediately affected by the restrictions because the C-band licenses it bought aren't available until late 2023. </p><p>   Air-safety authorities have said that C-band signals could confuse aircraft radar altimeters -- equipment used to determine a plane's altitude -- potentially throwing off readings the devices take and pass to other systems. Telecom industry representatives dispute that claim. </p><p>   AT&amp;T and Verizon did agree to limit their cell towers' signals in buffer zones around some of the largest U.S. airports to address the FAA's concerns. </p><p>   Airlines including United Airlines Holdings Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. began Monday evening to detail what they said could be the impact of the 5G deployment on their operations. United estimated 15,000 flights this year could be canceled, delayed or diverted. JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes told employees in a memo: \"Massive disruptions that pile onto what we are dealing with will only set back our recovery even further.\" </p><p></p>",
