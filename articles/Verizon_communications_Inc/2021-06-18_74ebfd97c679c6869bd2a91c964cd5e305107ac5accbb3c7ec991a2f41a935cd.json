  "title": "Floating-Rate Bonds Make a Comeback  ----  By Sebastian Pellejero",
  "text": "<p>   Investors are snapping up bonds with yields that rise and fall with interest rates, spurring a wave of debt offerings by blue-chip companies. </p><p>   Nonfinancial companies including Verizon Communications Inc. and the 7-Eleven unit of Seven &amp; I Holdings Co., have sold more than $18 billion worth of investment-grade bonds with variable interest rates this year through June 14, according to data compiled by Dealogic. That is nearly four times the amount issued in the same period last year. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials signaled that they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they had anticipated. The prospect of rising rates, even in the future, tends to make the fixed rates of traditional bonds less attractive. Accordingly, more investors are moving to floating-rate bonds, so that their portfolios will be at least partly cushioned against the impact of future rate increases. </p><p>   When including sales from U.S. banks, about $134 billion of floating-rate corporate bonds have been issued as of May, according to Bank of America Corp. That nearly matches the average annual issuance of $135 billion since 2008. </p><p>   Expectations for higher interest rates have also stoked investor demand for other assets with floating yields, such as corporate loans with junk credit ratings. </p><p>   The last time floating-rate bond issuance picked up this much was before the 2008 financial crisis, said Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America. The Fed started to increase rates in 2004. Then from that year through 2007, U.S. companies sold over $1.5 trillion worth of floating-rate bonds -- more than was sold during the decade ending 2019. </p><p>   \"It obviously has to do with investors' concerns about interest rates rising,\" Mr. Mikkelsen said. \"When you buy floating-rate debt and rates go up, you can still have some positive returns.\" </p><p>   The economic rebound and support from the Fed have helped spark a flood of new corporate debt and eased investors' worries about a pandemic-fueled wave of defaults. U.S. companies sold the most bonds ever in 2020, while yields on investment-grade and junk bonds -- which fall as bond prices rise -- slid to record lows. This month, the Fed announced it would soon start selling corporate bonds and bond exchange-traded funds acquired last year. </p><p>   An index of floating-rate notes that mature within five years has returned around 0.3% to investors this year, as of June 15, when counting price changes and interest payments, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That beats the minus 2% return on investment-grade bonds overall during the same period. </p><p>   More than 60% of bonds that make up the $503.7 billion floating-rate market have a maturity between one and three years, suggesting investors seek them out for short-term protection. Around 70% of outstanding floating-rate, investment-grade bonds are tied to banks, leading all sectors, followed by auto companies. Banks benefit from rising rates because they can charge more for loans. Auto companies can also benefit from higher loan prices. </p><p>   Convenience-store operator 7-Eleven this past February sold a $1.5 billion floating-rate note due August 2022 at a 0.612% yield. The note recently traded at 100.07 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by FactSet, implying a 0.55% yield. </p><p></p>",
