  "title": "Being on Your Parents' Phone Plan Is Now Cool Thanks to Inflation; It might seem easy to joke about people in their 30s and 40s still being on their family's plans. But those facing surging prices for everything from cars to cantaloupe say that bundled phone lines make good financial sense.",
  "text": "<p>Rates are significantly lower for those with multiple lines on their plans. On AT&amp;T, a single-line plan starts at $65 a month. Customers with four or more lines see rates starting at $35 a month for each device. Verizon family plans also start at $35 a line, while single-line options start at $60.</p><p>Thirty- and 40-somethings once hid that they were still on the plans they have been on since middle school. Now, they're no longer hiding it. With the price of gas, groceries and other goods going up, they're viewing multiline plans as a logical financial step.</p><p>Amanda Smith, a Los Angeles resident, says she's not embarrassed to have the same plan she has been on since 2001, when her Nokia 3310 phone with swappable faceplates was the envy of her peers.</p><p>\"Being 36 now is so much more expensive than it was when my mom was 36,\" says Ms. Smith, who works in jewelry sales. Her food, transportation and entertainment expenses have all gone up in recent months, she says.</p><p>While she can afford to pay for her own Verizon line, her parents don't ask her to pay them back for her portion of the bill. If she weren't bundled with her family, Ms. Smith, who is single, says she would join a plan with her friends: \"I would turn to one of my friends and her husband and say, 'Adopt me so I can be on your cellphone plan.' \"</p><p>She says it felt personal when she learned that 36-year-old former Trump administration strategist Stephen Miller was attempting to block a subpoena of his cellphone records on the grounds that he was still on his parents' plan. She says the strategist espouses self-reliance, which made the revelation that he still relied on his childhood cell service seem hypocritical.</p><p>Mr. Miller didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Does your family keep adults on a family cellular plan? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Matthew Nyers, 42, sees no reason to hop off the plan he has been on with his parents and 32-year-old sister for the past 20 years. Never mind that he has a wife and three children.</p><p>\"I think it's pretty funny,\" the Columbia, Md., financial manager says. His wife is on her own plan with her dad, and his three children aren't old enough for cellphones yet. Mr. Nyers feels as if the bills balance themselves out because his wife pays for her father and his father pays for him.</p><p>When his children are old enough for their own phones, he says they'll probably join his wife's plan. \"Then maybe the time will come for me to finally leave my old family plan,\" he says, adding that luckily won't be for at least another four years.</p><p>For now, separate plans help keep the peace in his marriage: Mr. Nyers says his wife doesn't need the unlimited data plans he favors, and she doesn't want to pay for something she doesn't use.</p><p>The only potential hiccup? Mr. Nyers, his parents and his sister all have sequential numbers only one digit away from each other.</p><p>As of March, Verizon says 33% of its customer base is on \"premium unlimited mix and match\" plans, one of the company's multiline options. The plans will account for approximately 55% of their user base by 2023 and 70% by 2025, said Manon Brouillette, Verizon Consumer Group CEO, during this month's investor's day.</p><p>Dustin Growik, 41, has been on the same plan since he got a phone in college, and sees no reason to leave.</p><p>The Queens, N.Y., resident, who works in the science department at Sotheby's, says that some of his friends' parents still help them with rent and other living expenses. His 37-year-old sister and 31-year-old brother are also still on his dad's plan. \"It keeps the family together,\" Mr. Growik says.</p><p>Katy Stoll, 37, is planning to exit her parents' Verizon plan after roughly 21 years. But not because she craves independence: She just needs better reception in her hilly neighborhood. AT&amp;T recently installed new lines in the neighborhood, boosting service.</p><p>\"I was like, 'All right, that did it,' \" the Los Angeles podcast host says.</p><p>Her dad occasionally teased her for still being on his bill, she says, but she paid him back for her portion with a lump sum at the end of each year. For a long time, Ms. Stoll says she used to joke that wanting to retain the phone number she's had since she was 16 as her excuse not to switch. But she says she's long suspected she can keep the same number even if she switches providers. That is true for most carriers.</p><p>Plenty of her friends are still on their family plans, too, Ms. Stoll says. She believes the trend is representative of the economic undercurrent of the moment.</p><p>\"Everything seems so up in the air and we don't know what the future holds, so it's hard to make any sort of financial decisions,\" she says.</p><p>Write to Rachel Wolfe at rachel.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>Being on Your Parents' Phone Plan Is Now Cool Thanks to Inflation</p>",
