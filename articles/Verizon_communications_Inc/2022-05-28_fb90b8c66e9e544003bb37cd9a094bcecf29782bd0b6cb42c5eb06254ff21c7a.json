  "text": "<p>\n  CHARLES R. LEE </p><p>\n  1940-2022 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Charles R. Lee's road to the top of the telecommunications industry was winding and unpredictable. </p><p>\n  He grew up on a farm near Pittsburgh, played high-school football, showed a flair for math and -- only because his mother insisted -- enrolled at Cornell University to study metallurgical engineering instead of staying closer to home. </p><p>\n  Mr. Lee, who died May 13 of cancer at the age of 82, started his career in finance at U.S. Steel Corp. and then helped the Penn Central railroad company emerge from bankruptcy and was chief financial officer at Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. before joining GTE Corp. in 1983 and rising to chief executive in 1992. </p><p>\n  GTE was an oddball as an independent company competing with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and making lightbulbs through its Sylvania unit. When AT&amp;T's dominant Bell System was broken up in 1984 to spur competition, GTE had to find its place in a new order soon to be shaken beyond recognition by the rise of the internet and wireless communications. </p><p>\n  Mr. Lee sold the Sylvania business and put all his chips on telecom. Soon suitors were knocking. Among them was Bell Atlantic Corp., one of the Baby Bells spun off from the old AT&amp;T. </p><p>\n  To break the ice, Bell Atlantic CEO Raymond Smith presented Mr. Lee with a bound copy of Alexander Graham Bell's drawings. </p><p>\n  \"Ray, I'm not a Bell company,\" Mr. Lee said, according to Mr. Smith's later recollection. </p><p>\n  Mr. Smith replied: \"We're all the children of Alexander Graham Bell.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Smith's successor, Ivan Seidenberg, and Mr. Lee sealed a merger agreement in 1998. The companies finally received regulatory approvals and completed the merger in 2000 under the new name of Verizon Communications Inc. Mr. Lee, who initially served as co-CEO with Mr. Seidenberg, disliked the Verizon name. He preferred the telecom tradition of using initials, like GTE or AT&amp;T, but went along in the end. </p><p>\n  \"I learned a long time ago: You don't get mad,\" he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"You just keep going.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Seidenberg noticed that Mr. Lee, in the middle of tense negotiations, would suddenly change the subject and tell stories about his grandchildren before looping back to the business issue. Mr. Seidenberg was baffled at first by these detours but finally concluded they were Mr. Lee's way of pausing to organize his thoughts. \"He didn't like to be quiet when he was thinking,\" Mr. Seidenberg said. </p><p>\n  Verizon is now the biggest U.S. cellphone carrier in terms of subscribers. </p><p>\n  Charles Robert Lee, known as Chubby in his youth and later as Chuck, was born Feb. 15, 1940. He grew up on a 52-acre farm owned by his maternal grandfather. His father had various business interests, and his mother drove a school bus. </p><p>\n  By age 10, Mr. Lee was tending his own patch of tomatoes and green beans, loading produce on a truck and selling it door to door in Pittsburgh. \"Then I graduated to raising chickens and capons,\" he told the New York Times in 2000. \"They were neutered male chickens, cut with a knife, something I would do.\" </p><p>\n  He was tempted to attend Pittsburgh's Carnegie Tech, later Carnegie Mellon University, so he could \"continue my party life and be with all my friends.\" But he was being recruited by football coaches from a school he had never heard of, Cornell. His mother told him Cornell was a better bet. While studying engineering there, he played center on the football team. He married Ilda Gerhardt, whom he had met in high school. </p><p>\n  Mr. Lee went on to earn an M.B.A. degree at Harvard Business School in 1964.\"Out of Harvard, I got 10 offers,\" he said. \"Everybody got 10 offers out of Harvard.\" He chose U.S. Steel in his hometown and stayed there until 1970, when he joined Penn Central, shortly before it filed for reorganization under bankruptcy laws. His role was to help sort out the company's real estate, hotels and other non-railroad interests. </p><p>\n  Mr. Lee, who retired from Verizon in 2003, is survived by his wife, five children and 16 grandchildren. </p><p>\n  He compiled a list of life rules for his grandchildren. They included: </p><p>\n  \"Speed limit is 5 above or 5 below.\" </p><p>\n  \"Never let your gas tank go below half.\" </p><p>\n  \"Plain and old will always satisfy, you don't need fancy and new.\" </p><p></p>",
