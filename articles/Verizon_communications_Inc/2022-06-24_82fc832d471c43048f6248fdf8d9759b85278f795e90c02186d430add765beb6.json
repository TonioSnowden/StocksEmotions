  "title": "NFL Courts Apple, Amazon to Give New Life to 'Sunday Ticket' Football; League is seeking a new media-rights deal for the subscription package, which has suffered from cord-cutting and scheduling changes",
  "text": "<p>The league faces some headwinds as it looks for its next partner. The NFL has created new media packages over the years that reduced the number of Sunday games and has aired snippets of live action on its RedZone channel, cutting into Sunday Ticket's appeal. Pay-TV cord-cutting also has weighed on Sunday Ticket's value, media executives said.</p><p>The package currently has about 1.5 million subscribers, down from some two million customers at its height, and DirecTV has been losing around $500 million annually on it for several years, people familiar with the financials of the package said.</p><p>Nevertheless, the NFL is fielding interest from several potential suitors. Apple Inc. is considered a leading contender for Sunday Ticket, according to people familiar with the matter, while Amazon.com Inc., which already has experience streaming Thursday night NFL games, is also in the mix.</p><p>\"The NFL is migrating to streaming and there's only a few companies that can add that expertise. It boils down to Amazon and Apple,\" said sports consultant Lee Berke.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How much is the NFL's Sunday Ticket package actually worth? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN, which last year agreed to pay an average annual fee of $2.7 billion to continue being the home of \"Monday Night Football,\" is also circling Sunday Ticket for its ESPN+ streaming service.</p><p>The NFL has long believed that Sunday Ticket has been an underused asset and that offering it via streaming would allow it to flourish. Selling Sunday Ticket without requiring consumers to have a satellite dish would make the package more popular, people close to the NFL said. Sunday Ticket is being unfairly tarnished by the cord-cutting trend that has hurt the pay-TV industry and DirecTV in particular, those people said.</p><p>Last year, the league signed long-term media deals valued at more than $100 billion. The NFL secured a combined average increase of 75% to 80% in fees, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>The NFL would like to get paid between $2.5 billion and $3 billion annually for Sunday Ticket, said Pat Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive who is now a media consultant. That may be a reach, he said, because while Apple and Amazon each have deep pockets, neither has a desperate need for the package.</p><p>ESPN has indicated it would be willing to pay between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>DirecTV, which has had exclusive rights to Sunday Ticket since 1994, may at least seek to keep the rights to sell the package to bars and restaurants.</p><p>DirecTV is co-owned by AT&amp;T Inc. and private-equity firm TPG under a deal that splits operational control of the business. Last June, DirecTV said it had about 15 million pay-TV customers.</p><p>Potentially further complicating a deal is the NFL's desire to package Sunday Ticket rights along with a stake in its NFL Media unit, which includes the NFL Network and RedZone channels and the NFL.com site. Last year, the NFL retained Goldman Sachs to look for potential investors and now the league is hoping to kill two birds with one stone with the Sunday Ticket deal, people familiar with the NFL's thinking said.</p><p>Cord-cutting has hurt the NFL Network and RedZone's distribution is relatively small. Also, the NFL Network only has a handful of exclusive games. \"NFL Media is clouding this up,\" Mr. Crakes said.</p><p>The people close to the league counter that while the process may take longer, the opportunity to combine Sunday Ticket with the NFL's other media brands is an enticing prospect.</p><p>Apple has been spending aggressively on sports lately. Earlier this month it struck a 10-year deal worth at least $2.5 billion for global rights to Major League Soccer. The tech company also has significant global rights to air two Major League Baseball gameson Friday nights. The NFL has broad appeal that could bring more subscribers to Apple's TV+ streaming service.</p><p>Apple is interested in world-wide rights for Sunday Ticket, a person familiar with the company's thinking said. The NFL has in the past been reluctant to strike global rights deals, believing it is better to have many partners. However, the league isn't completely opposed to the idea if a compelling case for it can be made.</p><p>If the NFL doesn't get an enticing offer, it could choose to put the Sunday games on NFL+, the direct-to-consumer streaming service it is launching this season. The service will replace the NFL's previous deal with Verizon Inc., which carried in-market games on mobile devices.</p><p>Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.</p><p>NFL Courts Apple, Amazon to Give New Life to 'Sunday Ticket' Football</p>",
