  "title": "Business News: AT&T, Verizon Test Higher-Price Strategy",
  "text": "<p>AT&amp;T Inc., starting in June, raised the cost of its older wireless plans by up to $6 for single lines and $12 for family plans, encouraging subscribers to adopt newer unlimited data plans.</p><p>Verizon Communications Inc. later matched AT&amp;T with a $6 or $12 monthly price increase on metered-data plans. It raised some monthly fees on consumer wireless plans by $1.35 and levied a monthly per-smartphone fee of up to $2.20 on many business plans.</p><p>Verizon consumer group chief Manon Brouillette said consumers are worried about the economic environment but the carrier remained confident in its prices because its customers value its reliable network.</p><p>T-Mobile US Inc. has seized on its rivals' price increases to burnish its lower-cost reputation, calling the decisions insensitive to overburdened consumers. Many T-Mobile rates are frozen anyway under a regulatory agreement tied to its 2020 takeover of Sprint Corp., though the company can still revise fees. The company in February raised monthly fees on some older plans by up to 31 cents.</p><p>T-Mobile said its fees will affect a smaller share of its customers. The company is adding perks to its most expensive consumer and business plans to convince customers to upgrade service. New offerings include high-speed data service in more than 200 countries and free Wi-Fi on Alaska, American and Delta flights. \"What we're doing is dramatically different,\" T-Mobile marketing chief Mike Katz said.</p><p>Verizon is so far the only wireless carrier to raise fees on a plan advertised today. Most other increases have hit cheaper plans no longer offered to new customers.</p><p>\"We didn't do a broad stroke across the entire customer base,\" AT&amp;T Chief Operating Officer Jeff McElfresh said at a recent investor conference. \"We looked at a cohort of customers that were on the oldest rate plans that didn't have access to 5G or some of the best features and benefits.\"</p><p>The top three U.S. carriers declined to detail how much the increases will benefit their revenue. Media and telecom research firm LightShed Partners estimates Verizon's three price increases will add another $2.4 billion to Verizon's annual revenue over time. It expects AT&amp;T and T-Mobile's increases to add $700 million and $100 million, respectively, to annual revenue.</p><p>Carriers have reinvested revenue into their networks, which cost billions of dollars each year to maintain and billions more to reach fifth-generation standards capable of serving high-speed internet.</p>",
