  "title": "U.S. News: FAA Chief Weighs Flight Curbs Over 5G",
  "text": "<p>Now, the wireless fight has placed Mr. Dickson at odds with telecommunications companies and their regulator as the FAA chief considers imposing flight restrictions ahead of a planned Jan. 5 rollout of new 5G services. Aviation-industry officials say those 5G signals could interfere with key cockpit safety systems used to land aircraft in poor weather, prevent crashes and avoid midair collisions.</p><p>While the telecom industry, which began preparing for the rollout three years ago, has said the available evidence doesn't show 5G signals will interfere with airplanes, Mr. Dickson has the authority to impose restrictions if he perceives possible safety hazards. The FAA is expected to outline potential flight limits as soon as Friday or early next week, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The potential flight limits could significantly disrupt air travel, leading to cancellations and diversions in bad weather and reduced airline schedules, aviation-industry officials have said. Mr. Dickson has said the FAA is working with telecom companies to avoid that.</p><p>Last week, AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. proposed limits on some of their 5G wireless service for six months in response to aviation-industry concerns, a move the FAA called encouraging. Aviation-industry officials, however, said significant flight limits might still be needed.</p><p>As a manager, current and former colleagues said Mr. Dickson is comfortable carefullyweighing available evidence and defending his positions -- without caving to pressure to move swiftly. Mr. Dickson, a pilot and former Delta Air Lines Inc. executive, took over the FAA in 2019.</p><p>Mr. Dickson's tenure began not long after two FAA-approved Boeing 737 MAX jets crashed overseas in 2018 and 2019, claiming 346 lives.</p><p>He declined to be interviewed. \"Administrator Dickson has acted throughout his tenure to find solutions that protect aviation safety,\" the FAA said in a written statement.</p><p>In the 5G fight, Mr. Dickson is navigating an issue of significant importance outside the FAA. The White House has had the FAA's potential restrictions undergo a broader government review, stirring concern inside the aviation regulator about outside influence on safety issues, people familiar with the matter said. A senior White House official said the White House isn't weighing in on technical questions related to the 5G deployment and aviation.</p><p>At a mid-November industry event in Washington, Mr. Dickson said 5G wireless technology and aviation can coexist. Both the telecom and aviation industries could make changes to ease the deployment, he said then, with next steps still to be determined. \"It'll be a little while,\" Mr. Dickson said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
