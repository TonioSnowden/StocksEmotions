  "text": "<p>Many of the billions of robocalls annoying Americans emanate from India, the Philippines and other countries. FCC officials say the regulation, known as the foreign provider prohibition, would allow them to better trace the sources of illegal calls and block companies that carry them.</p><p>The nation's largest telecoms -- AT&amp;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. -- say they support measures aimed at stemming illegal robocalls, but that the foreign-provider prohibition as written could have unintended negative consequences.</p><p>They say foreign-based phone companies aren't prepared for the rule, which could lead to legitimate calls being blocked because U.S. carriers aren't allowed to accept calls from companies that aren't in compliance.</p><p>For example, if an American customer travels to India and calls home with her mobile phone, the call might not go through if the local Indian phone company isn't in good standing with the FCC.</p><p>CTIA, a trade group representing Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile, petitioned the FCC to delay implementation in December and said the foreign provider prohibition \"lacks sufficient support\" under the Administrative Procedure Act. Executives have since been calling FCC staff to make their case for a delay, FCC records show.</p><p>\"We strongly support the direction the FCC is going to address the foreign robocall problem, to police the edge of the U.S. telephone network,\" Verizon associate general counsel Christopher Oatway said. \"We would like to pause the process, re-examine what needs to be done and continue to work on ways to create effective barriers to these incessant calls.\"</p><p>George Slover, senior policy counsel with Consumer Reports, a nonprofit that reviews products and advocates for consumers, said it is important that the rules don't affect Americans' legitimate calls, but the FCC shouldn't delay too long.</p><p>\"A slight pause could be helpful\" to address unintended consequences, he said. \"If the foreign providers aren't making every effort to complete and certify compliance, there needs to be consequences for that.\"</p><p>In comments to the FCC, the only person to counter the telecoms' delay request was David Frankel, chief executive of ZipDX LLC, a Utah-based conference call provider.</p><p>Mr. Frankel, who helped develop an industry robocall tracing program, conceded that the program might inconvenience some Americans traveling abroad.</p><p>But he said those whose calls are blocked have other methods at their disposal, such as a Wi-Fi call, text or calling from a hotel or office.</p><p>\"How many Americans are overseas in circumstances where they are trying to call home this way, versus how many people are being bombarded with these illegal calls?\" he asked.</p><p>The wireless giants declined to say how many customers might be affected by the rule. A CTIA spokesman said the group's focus \"is on working with the FCC to help clarify the scope and implementation.\"</p><p>AT&amp;T and T-Mobile declined to comment. Other companies have written to the FCC backing the wireless giants.</p><p>The FCC declined to comment. It isn't required to respond to the industry's pending petition.</p><p>The foreign provider prohibition is part of a broader agenda to plug the robocall deluge. The FCC has empowered companies to block suspected illegal calls, mandated caller ID authentication and threatened to shut down small companies facilitating illegal calls.</p>",
