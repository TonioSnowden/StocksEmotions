  "text": "<p>It all started out as a mistake.</p><p>As a young investment banker in Texas, with a Harvard M.B.A. and a gift for salesmanship, he agreed to cosign a loan with two friends who bought a small, unprofitable radio station in San Antonio in 1972. Mr. Mays wanted nothing to do with operating a radio station. Soon, however, he found himself the station's owner when the friends couldn't meet debt payments.</p><p>Mr. Mays brought in another friend, Billy Joe \"Red\" McCombs, a car dealer, as a partner in what became Clear Channel. Soon they were buying more stations.</p><p>When the Telecommunications Act of 1996 reduced restrictions on ownership of radio stations, Clear Channel went on a buying spree. \"We were off to the races,\" Mr. Mays said later in a video interview.</p><p>Clear Channel's critics said it was replacing local DJs and radio personalities with coast-to-coast conformity. A DJ riffing on local news and weather in Des Moines, Iowa, might be sitting in Los Angeles.</p><p>At a 2003 U.S. Senate committee hearing on consolidation of media ownership, Don Henley, a member of the Eagles rock band, said Clear Channel was so powerful it could pressure artists into promotional deals. Mr. Mays denied that the company coerced artists in any way and said it was offering more choices for listeners.</p><p>He didn't see himself as a purveyor of news or Top 40 hits but rather as a supplier of advertising opportunities. \"I'm in the business of selling automobiles and tamales,\" Mr. Mays told Forbes magazine.</p><p>In July 2008, Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP acquired Clear Channel Communications Inc. for about $17.9 billion. The acquisition left the business, renamed iHeart, loaded with borrowings. A decade later, iHeart filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure its debt.</p><p>Lester Lowry Mays, known by his middle name, was born July 24, 1935, in Houston and grew up in Dallas. His father, a steel salesman, died in a traffic accident when Lowry was 10 years old. Young Lowry worked as a hotel bellhop and sold peanuts at football games.</p><p>Dreaming of oil riches, he enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University and majored in petroleum engineering. After graduating in 1957, he served in the Air Force, which sent him to Taiwan to oversee construction of a pipeline.</p><p>While in the Air Force, he married Peggy Pitman, a grade-school teacher in San Antonio. After completing his military service, Mr. Mays enrolled at Harvard Business School and earned an M.B.A. degree in 1962. He found work at Russ &amp; Co., an investment bank in Texas.</p><p>Rapid profit growth in the 1990s made Clear Channel a hot stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Mays said that provided an opportunity to reward executives with equity. \"They were all happy because they were making all this money,\" he said. \"I guess that led to the success more than anything.\"</p><p>In 2000, Clear Channel bought SFX Entertainment Inc., a giant concert promoter, for nearly $3 billion. The concert business was supposed to thrive on support from the radio stations and billboards, but those synergies didn't match expectations, and concert profits proved disappointing. Five years later, Clear Channel spun off its live-entertainment business, renamed Live Nation.</p><p>Clear Channel's results deteriorated in the early 2000s as attractive acquisitions became harder to find and ad spending slumped. Mr. Mays had health problems. His sons took on more responsibility for running the company.</p><p>Through the Mays Family Foundation, Mr. Mays was a major donor to Texas A&amp;M, which named its business school after him. The foundation also has made gifts to healthcare, educational and other causes.</p><p>Mr. Mays is survived by four children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Peggy Mays, died in 2020.</p><p>His grandchildren called him Chief. At his ranch near Spring Branch, Texas, Mr. Mays kept herds of zebras, kudus, oryx and bongo antelopes from Africa. He enjoyed feeding saltine crackers to his bongos.</p><p>Lowry Mays Founded Radio Empire That Became iHeartMedia</p>",
