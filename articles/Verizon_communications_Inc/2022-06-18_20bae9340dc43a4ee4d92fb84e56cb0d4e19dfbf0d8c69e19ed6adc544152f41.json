  "title": "U.S. News: 5G Will Be Phased In Near Airports",
  "text": "<p>The wireless companies earlier this year agreed to delay the launch of a sliver of their fifth-generation wireless service near key airports while regulators studied concerns that newer 5G wireless signals might confuse some onboard airplane sensors. The standstill agreement was due to expire on July 5.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that key stakeholders from the wireless and aviation industries have identified the next steps to protect commercial air travel and cellphone service over the next 12 months. AT&amp;T and Verizon said they would turn on their enhanced 5G service around more airports in phases during that time.</p><p>Airlines for America, which represents the biggest U.S. passenger airlines, criticized the plan in a letter Friday to acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen. The FAA said Friday that regional airlines can retrofit the sensors most susceptible to interference by the end of this year. It is seeking to upgrade other sensitive radar altimeters by July 2023.</p><p>\"Given that the FAA has not even approved solutions nor have manufacturers manufactured these products for most of this fleet, it is not at all clear that carriers can meet what appears to be an arbitrary deadline,\" Airlines for America President Nicholas Calio wrote.</p><p>FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said the regulator's plan \"accurately reflects the realities of the marketplace, as well as the urgency for operators to retrofit their fleets.\"</p><p>U.S. regulators' concerns have focused on early research that showed some radar altimeters -- sensors that use radio waves to measure altitude during some phases of flight -- could pick up signals outside their normal spectrum ranges. Wireless companies have said the cellular frequencies pose no threat to aircraft, noting similar networks active around the world. Potentially threatened aircraft could be protected with new radar altimeters. Installing frequency filters on existing equipment also could eliminate the problem, engineers say.</p><p>AT&amp;T said the tailored wireless expansion plan would give airlines more time to make changes. Verizon's policy chief, Craig Silliman, said Friday that the new plan identified a path for the company to eventually make full use of its 5G-capable spectrum licenses everywhere \"on an accelerated and defined schedule.\"</p>",
