  "text": "<p>NBCUniversal, the Comcast unit most severely affected by Covid-19, began to recover as the pandemic eased. The segment's overall revenue increased 39% to nearly $8 billion The theme-park segment generated more than $1 billion during the second quarter, an eightfold increase from the year-earlier period when theme parks were closed because of the pandemic, and was profitable for the first time since the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Revenue for the media segment, which includes broadcast and cable TV, rose 26% to $5.15 billion. Ratings for the company's broadcasts of the Summer Olympic Games have so far been lackluster, and will show up in third-quarter results. Viewership for the opening ceremony on Friday was down 36% compared with 2016, the lowest ratings for the kickoff night in more than three decades.</p><p>\"The Olympics had a little bit of bad luck, the drumbeat of negativity,\" NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell said on an earnings call, noting that the Games were delayed a year because of the pandemic and spectators are blocked from attending. \"That has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than what we expected,\" he added.</p><p>Mr. Shell said strength in digital viewing has helped balance out the TV ratings. \"So net-net, with all this bad luck, we're going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we're very happy with,\" he said.</p><p>NBCUniversal has used the Olympics as a springboard for Peacock, its flagship streaming-video service. Peacock now has 54 million sign-ups, and more than 20 million monthly active accounts, the company said Thursday.</p><p>Comcast didn't disclose other details such as the proportion of customers paying for the service. Peacock's premium, $4.99-a-month version is free to Comcast cable and broadband customers with its Flex devices, as well as those using Cox Communications Inc. The company said the streaming service will be given to Sky's 20 million customers across Europe for no additional cost.</p><p>Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts attributed Peacock's 50% increase in sign-ups since the previous quarter to three factors: the \"Boss Baby\" movie sequel that was available on Peacock and in theaters on the same day; the debut of \"Dr. Death,\" a new TV drama; and the Olympics.</p><p>Peacock had revenue of $122 million during the quarter on a loss of $363 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.</p>",
