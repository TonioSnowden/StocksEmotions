  "title": "Investing In Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Winners' Circle: The Lockdown Year's Top Stock-Fund Managers --- In a chaotic time for mutual funds, Morgan Stanley's Dennis Lynch was No. 1, with a 273% surge",
  "text": "<p>How did the professional stock pickers at mutual funds do? Overall, no better than an index fund. But the best of them blew away the field -- including a spectacular 273% gain for the No. 1 fund, the small-stock-focused Morgan Stanley Inception Portfolio (MSSGX).</p><p>The actively managed U.S. stock funds that The Wall Street Journal tracks (based on Morningstar data) for its quarterly Winners' Circle survey posted an average gain of 47% for the 12 months ended March 31. While that trailed the S&amp;P 500's 56% total return for the same period -- and fell short of recovering all the losses investors incurred in the selloff early in 2020 -- the best-performing funds did far, far better.</p><p>That's a testimonial either to the pros' ability to anticipate the disruptive change that would benefit the companies they add to their portfolios, or to their ability to tweak their holdings in response to the rapidly changing market environment.</p><p>A case in point: Dennis Lynch, head of the Counterpoint Global team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Funds managed by Mr. Lynch and his team have routinely earned top honors in the Winners' Circle. This time, it was their small-cap growth offering, Morgan Stanley Inception.</p><p>Mr. Lynch doesn't credit his fund's outperformance to any attempt to pick the bull market's new crop of winners. Rather, his team has long emphasized identifying opportunities in the kinds of disruptive business models that emerged in the \"pandemic market.\"</p><p>Among them: Fastly Inc., whose edge-computing technologies helps improve the performance of cloud-based apps, including online gaming that many Americans flocked to during lockdowns. \"We prioritize long-term thinking over knee-jerk reactions, especially during a period of turmoil and crisis like last year,\" Mr. Lynch says.</p><p>As always, the Journal isn't recommending that investors view the quarterly ranking as a shopping list. Many of the funds may have high fees, or be closed to new investors or otherwise inaccessible. But their managers may still offer insight into what's happening in the market. The survey also includes only actively managed mutual funds with a three-year record and more than $50 million in assets; it excludes sector funds, quantitative funds and funds that employ leverage.</p><p>Funds concentrating on small-cap or microcap stocks dominated. That doesn't surprise Scott Opsal, director of research for Leuthold Group of Minneapolis. \"Huge returns coming off a bear market's bottom are pretty typical,\" he says. \"In a bear market, investors turn conservative; in the first leg of a bull market recovery, they're willing to invest in less-stable businesses, to take a flier on less-established businesses and look to the future for their rewards.\"</p><p>\"I would never in a million years have envisioned this kind of market recovery,\" says Darren Chervitz, portfolio manager of Jacob Discovery Fund (JMIGX), the No. 2 Winners' Circle finisher. \"We've had more than 26 portfolio names post gains of more than 100% in the last 12 months.\" That propelled Mr. Chervitz's fund 220% higher for the 12-month period.</p><p>Jacob Discovery's assets under management ballooned in response to these returns, thanks both to capital gains and to an inflow of new cash, from only $10 million at the market's nadir in March 2020 to about $100 million a year later. Partly as a response to this and in part due to changing nature of the market, Mr. Chervitz oversaw a gradual expansion in the number of holdings from 40 to 60 companies.</p><p>\"When the pandemic first hit, I sought out companies that I thought would benefit from medical innovations as well as from people staying home: that was the first wave for me,\" says Mr. Chervitz.</p><p>He also added to positions in companies like Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc., which is developing mRNA-based vaccines (including another Covid-19 vaccine candidate) but also using the same genetic research to devise therapies to treat diseases like cystic fibrosis. The stock's price has tripled over the past 12 months, but it's the longer-term outlook that Mr. Chervitz finds intriguing. \"I see the potential for this kind of new medical technology to significantly expand lifespan over the coming decades,\" he argues.</p><p>Jeff James, the lead portfolio manager of Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX) -- which ended in fifth place with a 12-month return of 175% and rose nearly 13% in the first quarter -- also has been actively readjusting his portfolio in response to the shifts in the economy and the market. (The fund is closed to new investors, though the Driehaus small-cap fund, which Mr. James says has about a 50% overlap in holdings with the microcap fund, is open.)</p><p>\"For the first half of the last 12 months, the market has really been about pandemic beneficiaries,\" Mr. James says, including some of the fund's existing holdings. These included Freshpet Inc., which provides pandemic puppies and kittens (and other animals) with refrigerated fresh foods, and Fulgent Genetics, which developed some of the widely used Covid-19 tests.</p><p>\"As it became clear we'd have effective vaccines emerge, I've started shifting my emphasis and looking for companies that will benefit most from a reopening,\" Mr. James says. For instance, he took a stake in Bally's Corp., which owns casinos in a number of regional markets.</p><p>Not all top-performing fund managers relied on identifying the biggest beneficiaries of the new bull market. Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) earned third place with a 12-month return of 212%, thanks to its managers' early decision to invest in stable but high-growth businesses.</p><p>\"All of our core holdings had been in the fund prior to February 2020,\" says Michael Baron, who manages the fund with his father, investor Ron Baron. \"We don't try to outsmart the market, but we look for high-quality businesses able to weather the storms and continue to grow.\"</p><p>Mr. Baron attributes the outsize gains in many growth companies, and especially among smaller stocks, to the fact that the pandemic seems to have accelerated the pace of economic change. Disruptive companies offering new models were able to capitalize. For instance, Zillow Group Inc. already has captured more attention from eager home buyers (encouraged by ultralow interest rates) reluctant to tour homes in person with an agent.</p><p>The No. 4 finisher was Hodges Fund (HDPMX), with a 182% gain under Craig Hodges. It employs a \"go anywhere\" approach that enabled Mr. Hodges to add (and later subtract) pandemic-economy winners like Zoom Video Communications Inc. More recently, it has diversified, with small positions in sports betting firms (DraftKings Inc.) and food-delivery companies (Waitr Holdings Inc.). Like Mr. James at Driehaus, Mr. Hodges benefited from a stake in fitness-equipment maker Nautilus Inc., and he ventured further into the outdoor-sports arena with a stake in Callaway Golf Co.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. McGee is a writer in New England.
