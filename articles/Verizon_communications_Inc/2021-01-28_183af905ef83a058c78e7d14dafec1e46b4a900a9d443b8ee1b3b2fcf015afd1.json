  "text": "<p>Executives called the noncash accounting charge a sign of the pay-TV unit's aging status as the Dallas company promotes an internet-streaming model that gives its content-production business a direct line to viewers.</p><p>\"Our biggest and single-most important bet is HBO Max,\" Chief Executive John Stankey said on a conference call Wednesday. Executives plan to expand the service's footprint in other countries this year and launch an advertising-supported version in the second quarter.</p><p>Overall, AT&amp;T reported a fourth-quarter loss of $13.89 billion, or $1.95 a share, compared with a profit of $2.39 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.4% to $45.7 billion.</p><p>The pandemic has strained the company, pressuring revenue from cable networks such as CNN and TBS throughout the year and closing many of the theaters that show its Warner Bros. films. Those pullbacks obscured recent gains in the company's wireless service, which generates more than half of the company's profit.</p><p>The last three months of the year gave AT&amp;T a net gain of 800,000 postpaid phone subscribers, a metric watched closely by Wall Street. Rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. reported net gains of 279,000 and 824,000 such connections, respectively.</p><p>Revenue from AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia division fell 9.5% to $8.5 billion as the show-business side continued to wrestle with low box-office revenue and weak advertising revenue. The HBO business grew and ended the year approaching 42 million U.S. subscribers, a figure that includes older cable plans as well as the new online service.</p><p>AT&amp;T's media division stunned Hollywood last year with a plan to release all of Warner Bros.' 2021 movies on HBO Max the same day they hit theaters. Executives said the move would help the business cope with audiences reluctant to visit theaters during a pandemic, while giving the streaming service a boost.</p><p>The online-only HBO Max service ended the year with 17 million activated accounts. It isn't yet a year old but is competing in a crowded global streaming video marketplace where Netflix Inc. has eclipsed more than 200 million subscribers world-wide and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ reached nearly 87 million subscribers in December.</p><p>Revenue from AT&amp;T's traditional video unit, which includes U-verse and DirecTV services, fell 11% to $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The business ended the year with 17.2 million domestic connections, down from 20.4 million at the end of 2019.</p><p>AT&amp;T held deal discussions with suitors, including private-equity firm TPG, that valued the video business at more than $15 billion including debt. The fourth-quarter write-down reflects how the business has changed since AT&amp;T bought DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, or $66 billion including debt.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in August that AT&amp;T had tapped bankers to explore a deal to take the fast-shrinking business off its books.</p><p>The video losses have weighed on AT&amp;T's stock, which missed out on the stock market's rally. AT&amp;T shares fell about 20% last year. The shares fell 2.2% to $29.08 on Wednesday.</p><p>The company projected stability for 2021, predicting core adjusted earnings in line with last year's $3.18 per-share result and revenue growth around 1%, with $26 billion of free cash flow. The company generated $27.5 billion of free cash flow in 2020.</p>",
