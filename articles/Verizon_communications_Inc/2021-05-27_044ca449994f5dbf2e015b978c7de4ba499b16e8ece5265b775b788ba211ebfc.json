  "text": "<p>   Joseph Epstein's \"Scammers and Fraudsters From Sea to Shining Sea\" (op-ed, May 24) is disturbingly familiar. The grandson/car-crash ruse had my mother so convinced that she fibbed to the Walmart clerk about the $1,500 she wanted to wire. She insisted that, yes, she knew the person who had called to tell her about her grandson's needing cash. Fortunately, the staffer refused. </p><p>   That is not the disturbing part. The disturbing part is the notion that these scammers \"specialize in cheating older people\" who are \"less likely to see through the scam.\" I personally have received five of the seven insidious pitches Mr. Epstein cites, including an automated \"Social Security\" scam call at 9:52 a.m. on Monday, as I was writing this letter. I never felt old before. </p><p>   Technology, rather than the government intervention he recommends, may quell this scourge. I haven't owned a car in 15 years and have received hundreds of warranty calls in five years. My new iPhone, instead of displaying the caller's number on the screen as in the past, now flashes a message: \"Likely Scam.\" Enough said. </p><p>    Dennis Kneale </p><p>   Brooklyn, N.Y. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    There are two beneficiaries to these swindles, the thieves themselves and the carriers who grant them access to bandwidth. If caller ID is able to identify spam, why doesn't Verizon, my carrier, shut the call down? Why does my phone ring at all? How is it possible that a single source can generate thousands of calls with spoofed numbers listed that carriers are helpless to identify and shut down? Since putting one's name and number on do-not-call lists prevents nothing, the only conclusion is that the carriers are enjoying a premium from call centers that generate hundreds of thousands of calls per hour. Crocodile tears about helplessness in the face of that technology is bunk, and should be met by legislation that fines the carriers for every bogus call that leaks through; plainly, the carriers are partners in crime. The drain on American productivity is enough to require this legislation. </p><p>    Perry Glasser </p><p>   Haverhill, Mass. </p><p></p>",
