  "text": "<p>Some parents use software like Bark or Qustodio to place limits on kids' smartphones. Others purchase \"basic feature\" phones (aka \"dumb phones\" or flip phones) for their kids. These days, however, even flip phones can usually access the internet, so it's better to pick a device that offers more control. Here, four favorites of parents, experts and kids.</p><p>1. To Stick to the Basics in Style</p><p>The Light Phone II won't allow your child to get on the Internet or social media, but it will allow him to call and text (including group chats) on the AT&amp;T network, as well as access simple tools like an alarm, calculator and music/podcast player. The sleek black-and-white design looks grown-up enough to appease your 13-going-on-30 middle schooler. But the device is more expensive than our other picks, doesn't currently offer GPS tracking and won't ship until the fall. $299 plus plans from $30/month, thelightphone.com</p><p>2. To Fit In With Peers</p><p>Designed to mimic the appearance of an iPhone or Android (but without access to internet, games or social media) the Gabb is great for kids concerned with being the odd one out. It's also the device Ms. Hempe recommends to families because of its accessible price and plethora of parental controls -- from screen-time limits to GPS tracking. The phones run on Gabb's own 4G LTE network, no contract required. $100 plus plans from $20/month, gabbwireless.com</p><p>3. To Communicate Without Fuss</p><p>Exclusive to Verizon customers, the GizmoWatch 2 lets kids keep in touch with 10 approved contacts and comes with GPS tracking. But super-texter parents beware: You have to use the GizmoHub app to text the watch from your own phone, there is no group texting and your child can only text a pre-written phrase, emoji, or voice message. New York mom of two Katie Barr Cornish said, \"The Gizmo seemed more fun for my daughter, and less likely she'd lose it since it's on her wrist.\" $100 plus $10/month, verizon.com</p><p>4. To Use Age-Appropriate Apps</p><p>Pinwheel phones access neither the internet nor social media, but offer their own age-appropriate, nonaddictive apps like a virtual journal, e-reader and Duolingo language app. Parents use a companion app on their own phones to choose different modes like \"school mode\" or \"free play mode\" that allow or block features. Only whitelisted contacts (approved by a parent) can interact with the child. From $149 plus plans from $15/month, pinwheel.com</p>",
