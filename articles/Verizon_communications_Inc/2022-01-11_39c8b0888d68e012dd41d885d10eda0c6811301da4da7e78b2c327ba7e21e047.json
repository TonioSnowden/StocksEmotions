  "title": "The Underdog Quarterback Who Made Georgia's Championship Run; Stetson Bennett IV, a former walk-on, capped his winding career as a Bulldog with a critic-silencing performance",
  "text": "<p>And yet more often than not during this championship season, Georgia's title-hungry fans pointed to him as the Bulldogs' weak link.</p><p>But on Monday night, Bennett was also the player who delivered a championship to Georgia fans after 41 years of waiting. And so five years after it first began, the improbable legend of Stetson Bennett IV ended with the quarterback hosting a glittering football obelisk above his head, tears streaming down his cheeks.</p><p>The waterworks broke forth for Bennett well before the confetti started falling at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. With a minute left in regulation and Alabama trailing by eight points, the Crimson's Tide's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Bryce Young got the ball back with a chance to orchestrate a heroic tie. Once Alabama crossed midfield, Young launched a deep shot downfield that landed squarely in the hands of Georgia cornerback Kelee Ringo, who ran the football back for 79 yards and a touchdown that sealed the game.</p><p>\"I didn't even see him score the touchdown. I just saw him catch the pick,\" Bennett recalled on Tuesday morning. \"I can't see. I'm not that tall.\"</p><p>He was also too busy wiping away tears and hugging every teammate in sight on the sidelines to look to the endzone.</p><p>\"I hadn't cried in, I don't know, years, but that just came over me,\" Bennett said after the game. On Tuesday he added, \"I tried not to put, you know, the Bulldog Nation on my shoulders because I can't carry that weight. But when Kelee caught that pick…it just lifted off my shoulders.\"</p><p>The tears weren't just because of the Bulldogs' tortured history with Alabama, a team that had beaten them seven times in a row in many a consequential game. Nor were they about the weighty expectations of being the team anointed as best in the nation as soon as Week 2 of the season.</p><p>The tears were also about silencing critics—himself among them—who never seemed to believe that a former walk-on had a strong enough arm or a high enough football I.Q. to lead a team in the beastly Southeastern Conference to a winning season, let alone a title.</p><p>As a walk-on, Bennett started his time in Athens on an academic scholarship, thanks to the strength of his SAT scores, with admittedly \"zero shot\" of playing. He didn't attract notice from the coaching staff until bowl game practices while impersonating Oklahoma's shifty quarterback for the scout team ahead of Georgia's date with the Sooners in the 2018 Rose Bowl.</p><p>\"Five years ago he was delivering passes like Baker Mayfield against the scout team,\" Georgia coach Kirby Smart recalled on Monday night. \"There's a lot of guys that saw him on that scout team make plays with his feet, his arm whip and decision making, and we were very impressed.\"</p><p>Bennett didn't play a lick that night, or in Georgia's eventual overtime loss to Alabama in the national championship. He transferred to Jones Junior College in Mississippi to get playing time and prove that he was worthy of an athletic scholarship. His gamble worked, even if he returned to a familiar spot backing up five-star prospects Jake Fromm and Justin Fields.</p><p>Fields left for greener pastures at Ohio State after the 2018 season and Smart recruited more hotshot passers who jumped ahead of Bennett on the depth chart. Yet Bennett was always there to bail them out. He was a starter of last resort in four games during the 2020 season, then was promptly replaced by J.T. Daniels in October once the highly ranked transfer from Southern California got up to speed with the Bulldogs' playbook.</p><p>Bennett had a fair shot to win back the starting gig in the offseason as the rare 23-year-old SEC quarterback—older than the top four passers selected in the 2021 NFL draft. Despite his experience, the Georgia faithful concluded the job was Daniels' to lose. That much was clear from how many local businesses that were salivating over the opportunity to sign an endorsement deal with Daniels.</p><p>Bennett, on the other hand, announced he would donate most of his earnings from name, image and likeness to charity. He also decided to get rid of the distractions that came with it in an all-or-nothing bid for greatness.</p><p>\"I thought, 'Let's try not to let anything get in the way of that focus and just go get a flip phone',\" he explained of his decision this week. \"They actually still sell them at Verizon stores. Apparently a lot of old people still use them.\"</p><p>Daniels got the nod to start in the season opener against Clemson and Bennett did not attempt a pass until Week 2, when Georgia's coaches concluded that it was better to rest Daniels and let the backups bully the University of Alabama at Birmingham. And what a beatdown it was: of Bennett's 10 passes that Saturday, five were touchdowns. He played well enough to be benched by halftime.</p><p>Yet Smart wasn't ready to rule out Daniels, who started the Bulldogs next two games against South Carolina and Vanderbilt. It would take another injury, this time to Daniels' core muscles, for Bennett to be pressed into starting duty again. This time, he never gave it up.</p><p>\"Sometimes opportunity leads to things that end up going in your direction,\" explained offensive coordinator Todd Monken last month. \"We've tried to elevate guys that have talent on our roster, and we do that at every position, and some guys just combat that and fight and scratch and continue to play well and try to prove you wrong. That's what Stetson Bennett did.\"</p><p>Bennett finished the year with 29 touchdowns against seven interceptions, having completed 64.6% of his 287 attempts.</p><p>As the 2021 season stretched on, Bennett grew more comfortable with improvising when plays broke down, learned to trust his speed and shake off adversity. That much was clear on Monday night in how Bennett responded after his fumble early in the fourth quarter erased Georgia's lead and seemed to shift momentum to Alabama.</p><p>\"Once I fumbled the ball I was not going to be the reason we lost this game,\" Bennett said. \"It's the thing that Coach Smart and the whole team has been preaching all year: resiliency, toughness.\"</p><p>He charged down the field with two touchdown drives. A few minutes later on the sidelines, his tear duct spigots turned on and the rest is history.</p><p>Write to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com</p><p>The Underdog Quarterback Who Made Georgia's Championship Run</p>",
