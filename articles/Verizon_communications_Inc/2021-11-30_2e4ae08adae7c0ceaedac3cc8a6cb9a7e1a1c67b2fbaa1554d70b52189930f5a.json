  "title": "Jana Partners Urges Zendesk to Ditch Deal for SurveyMonkey Parent; New York activist investor has big stake in Zendesk, wants it to terminate Momentive Global acquisition",
  "text": "<p>Zendesk in late October agreed to buy Momentive in an all-stock deal that at the time was worth about $4.1 billion. Zendesk, with a market value of about $11.5 billion, specializes in helping companies with customer communications, while SurveyMonkey facilitates the design and implementation of web-based surveys. The firms have said that by combining, they could help companies get better feedback from customers.</p><p>But investors and analysts are skeptical. Zendesk's shares were down a total of 20% since the announcement, as of the close Monday, despite better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and fourth-quarter projections released when the deal was announced. Momentive shares are down about 15% over that period.</p><p>Jana wrote that the Momentive deal \"lacks financial merit, has questionable strategic logic, and introduces a high degree of execution risk for Zendesk shareholders.\" It would also diminish what Jana believes would be buyer interest in Zendesk, according to the investor. Jana said it plans to vote its shares against the issuance of Zendesk stock that would be needed to pay for the deal and could seek to replace board members.</p><p>Momentive shareholders are to receive 0.225 Zendesk share for each Momentive share. The deal is worth roughly $3.2 billion based on Monday's closing prices, or $21.40 a share compared with $28 when it was announced. It requires signoff from both sets of investors.</p><p>Although merger activity is booming, shareholders in some cases lately have revolted against deals they view as ill-conceived. In September, investors in Five9 Inc. voted down a planned acquisition by video-conferencing-software company Zoom Video Communications Inc. that was initially valued at nearly $15 billion. Zoom's shares had declined almost 30% between the merger's proposal and its cancellation.</p><p>Jana was founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. It has recently urged Macy's Inc. to consider a separation of its e-commerce business, a move the retailer is examining, and agitated at Vonage Holdings Corp., the cloud-communications provider that agreed to sell itself to Ericsson AB.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>Jana Partners Urges Zendesk to Ditch Deal for SurveyMonkey Parent</p>",
