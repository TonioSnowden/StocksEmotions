  "text": "<p>UK inflation climbed to a 30-year high in December, with the annual rate climbing to 5.4 per cent from 5.1 per cent in November. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a milder rise to 5.2 per cent. </p> <p>The consumer prices index now stands at the highest level since the current data series began*, the Office for National Statistics said. Using historic modelling, the ONS said the index was now at the highest level since March 1992. </p> <p>Food prices were one of the major factors pushing up the index. Prices of furniture and clothing also climbed. </p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>An exceptionally busy morning in the City today, so brace yourselves. </p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong>, Britain's big luxury goods brand, said full-price sales growth sped up in its third quarter as trading remained strong in the Americas and showed a significant improvement elsewhere. Full price sales rose 26 per cent compared with two years ago, though overall sales fell 3 per cent as Burberry reduced the amount of stock it marked down. It said full year adjusted operating profit should be up 35 per cent from last year at constant exchange rates, while currency headwinds were easing. </p> <p>Money transfer group <strong>Wise</strong> said its “take rate” — the amount it earns on transactions — would fall in the second half of its financial year after dropping another 0.01 percentage points in the latest quarter (to 0.73 per cent). But it said the fall would be more than offset by higher volumes, estimating full year annual revenue growth of 30 per cent, the second time it has raised revenue guidance since it listed on the London Stock Exchange last year. Volumes rose 38 per cent year-on-year during its third quarter, with revenues up 34 per cent. </p> <p><strong>JD Wetherspoon </strong>uses its trading update to lay out the “advantages for the nation” if the attendees at Downing Street “parties” in May 2020 had been able to visit pubs, which were closed at the time (<a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/JDW/trading-update/15292739\">here is the link</a> to the press release for more details). Chair Tim Martin said the company would be lossmaking in the first half of its financial year, but hoped that performance in the second half would be “much stronger”. For the first 25 weeks of its financial year, Wetherspoons said like for like sales are down 11.7 per cent on two years ago, with sales down more sharply in the 12 weeks to 16 January as the government imposed more restrictions. </p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong>, a company better known in the past for its profit warnings, raised its full-year earnings guidance today. The educational publishing group said full year group sales had risen 8 per cent and adjusted operating profit would be around £385m, better than the £375m analysts were anticipating. But while many companies provide comparisons against two years ago, Pearson only presents figures against 2020, the first year of pandemic disruption. </p> <p>Miner <strong>BHP </strong>warned there could be disruption to its iron ore business, as the easing of border restrictions in Western Australia next month could lead to an increase in worker absences caused by Omicron. </p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline </strong>is losing its chief scientific officer <strong>Hal Barron</strong> to Silicon Valley anti-ageing start-up Atlos Labs. Barron will stay on as a non-executive after he steps down in August. Tony Wood, who joined GSK from Pfizer in 2017, will take over the role which includes responsibilities for the pharma group's portfolio and pipeline. </p> <p><strong>KPMG</strong>&#xa0;has been fined £3m over its audits of Conviviality in 2017 and 2018, and issued with a severe reprimand by the Financial Reporting Council.</p> <p>And finally the <strong>Financial Conduct Authority </strong>follows up the Treasury's announcement yesterday of a crackdown on <strong>crypto promotions</strong> with proposals that would mean consumers could only invest if they are classed as restricted, high net worth or sophisticated investors. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Shares in <strong>Sony</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acb50daf-0fb2-4f51-8b25-c501488fb6fa\">fell almost 10 per cent</a> overnight after <strong>Microsoft</strong> announced it planned to buy video games group <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">for $75bn</a>. It was the biggest one-day drop in Sony shares since the start of the pandemic. Shares in Japanese gaming stocks climbed, however, as investors speculated they could become acquisition targets. </p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs'</strong> fourth-quarter earnings were worse than analysts expected, after weaker trading and higher pay demands from employees hit profits. Boss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589e\">David Solomon warned</a> there was “wage inflation everywhere”.</p> <p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong> have agreed to limit 5G services near US airports after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1f1d59f-2e9f-4f23-a80a-25dcc0274513\">eleventh-hour outcry</a> from airlines, which warned the debut of the technology later today could interfere with aircraft safety and navigation systems. </p> <p>Three stories from <strong>Hong Kong</strong> to finish: airline <strong>Cathay Pacific</strong> is offering pilots $3,700 (HK$29,000) to tempt them to fly under the city's strict quarantine measures; the cruise ship operator <strong>Genting Hong Kong</strong> has filed to wind up the company after it failed to secure funding; and a third of <strong>US companies</strong> in Hong Kong are struggling to fill senior roles according to a survey, in a sign of the impact local restrictions are having on business.
