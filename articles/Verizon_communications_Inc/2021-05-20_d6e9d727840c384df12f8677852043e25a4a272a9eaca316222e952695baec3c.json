  "title": "New iPad Pro Closes In on MacBook Air",
  "text": "<p>If you're in the market for either, weigh the specifics carefully:</p><p>Perks of the iPad Pro</p><p>An eye-popping display. Exclusive to the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro is what Apple is calling the \"Liquid Retina XDR\" display. Stuffed with thousands of mini LEDs, it has better contrast than any other Mac display. It's capable of 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness -- the same as Apple's $5,000 Pro Display XDR. Since those LEDs can individually brighten and dim, you get better detail and richer hues.</p><p>5G connectivity. The latest Pros can now tap into speedy 5G networks (for an extra $200 plus around $10 a month). In one extreme case, Verizon's ultrawideband clocked download speeds exceeding 3 gigabits per second -- over 50 times faster than my weak home broadband. Joining a Zoom or uploading a big file isn't a problem for a 5G iPad -- as long as you're within striking distance of a cell tower.</p><p>First-rate cameras. The iPad Pro has a wide and ultrawide camera on the rear. The depth-sensing LIDAR scanner uses them for applications ranging from document scanning in Notes to judging your forehand in SwingVision.</p><p>The best camera feature involves the new 12-megapixel ultrawide lens on the front of the display, which offers much better resolution than the MacBook Air's 720p FaceTime camera. When you're using any video-chat app, software called Center Stage will pan and zoom to keep you centered in the shot. If someone else appears, it widens its frame to include that person.</p><p>Speedy Face ID. On the iPad, you don't have to lift a finger to unlock your device or authorize Apple Pay. Both devices have biometric sensors, but the iPad Pro's Face ID authentication is faster and more convenient than the MacBook's Touch ID.</p><p>The Magic Keyboard. Typing on the Magic Keyboard is as satisfyingly clicky as the MacBook Air's updated keyboard. The trackpad is a bit cramped, but you can pair the iPad with a Bluetooth mouse. The adjustable viewing angles, backlit keyboards and extra USB-C port are great.</p><p>Precision input with touch. Moving around a map or photo with your fingers is more natural than clicking around with a mouse. The Apple Pencil ($129) turns the tablet into a digital notepad. You can highlight PDFs in LiquidText, jot searchable meeting notes in Penultimate or sketch in Procreate.</p><p>3-D sound. Last fall, Apple released Spatial Audio, virtual surround sound for content with multichannel audio such as Dolby Atmos. The feature works with AirPods Pro and AirPods Max headphones and isn't available on MacBooks (yet) -- only certain iOS devices and the new 24-inch iMac.</p><p>MacBook Air Benefits</p><p>Lots of windows. On a Mac, you can have as many windows open as the processor can handle. With the MacBook's M1 chip, that's plenty. The iPad is limited to two applications running side by side -- and only some allow two instances of the same app in that split view.</p><p>Longer battery life. The MacBook Air's battery is rated at 15 hours of web browsing. I got about 11 hours in regular use. I didn't get as much battery life from the iPad. Apple claims 10 hours on Wi-Fi, and nine hours on cellular. I got just over eight hours on Wi-Fi, and about six on cellular. The M1 is a power-efficient processor, but its benefits are offset by power-hogging 5G and the ultrabright display.</p><p>Extended displays. While some iPad apps make special use of external monitors, only the Mac can extend its screen across multiple displays. It's true, the iPad Pro now has Thunderbolt compatibility, supporting faster external drives and better monitors, but on external monitors, the connection still only mirrors the iPad's screen.</p><p>Better price. The MacBook Air starts at $999, but I'd recommend upgrading to 512 GB of storage, bringing the total to $1,199. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro begins at $1,099, but you'll want accessories, like the $129 Apple Pencil and the $349 Magic Keyboard. Together, the whole set is $1,577. There are less expensive iPad combos: The iPad Air starts at $599 and, with similar accessories, totals $1,027. But that model doesn't come with the XDR screen or the auto-pan-and-zoom camera software.</p><p>More ports. The MacBook is better equipped to handle peripherals. The laptop has two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. The iPad Pro has no headphone jack and just one USB-C/Thunderbolt port. (The Magic Keyboard adds another port, only for charging.)</p><p>Compatible with more printers. The iPad only works with AirPrint-enabled printers, while the MacBook can connect to printers through a USB connection as well.</p><p>iOS app compatibility. The M1 chip is based on the processor that powers iOS devices, so the M1-based MacBook Air is capable of running iOS apps, such as Calm. Developers can restrict Mac access to their apps, among the notably missing is Instagram.</p><p>MacOS is more powerful. Right now, if you want to run Windows via Parallels, reformat your hard drive or play Steam games, you can only do that on a Mac. We expect Apple to introduce new iPad software features next month.</p>",
