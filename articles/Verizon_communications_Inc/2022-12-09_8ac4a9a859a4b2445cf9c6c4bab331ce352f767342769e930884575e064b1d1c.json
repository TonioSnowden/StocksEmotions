  "text": "<p>The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. PBC, born from that brief email pitch from the company's founder, Alex Oshmyansky, buys generic drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers and sells them directly to patients online, rather than charging their insurance providers. By cutting out intermediaries and using a transparent pricing system, the pharmacy says it charges less than rivals for drugs: a 15% profit markup on a medicine's cost, plus several dollars in fees for shipping and labor.</p><p>Some 1.4 million people have signed up, and about 400,000 have filled at least two prescriptions from the pharmacy's offering of 350 drugs.</p><p>\"It blew up in a way we didn't really anticipate,\" says Dr. Oshmyansky, the company's 38-year-old chief executive. \"Making sure we have inventory, making sure there's enough staffing in the pharmacy, all of those little details have been a surprising challenge in the first year of operation.\"</p><p>The company, which currently has 41 employees, declined to disclose its revenue or other financial results.</p><p>Setting the company apart from its peers is its larger ambition to be an all-in-one drug company that makes and distributes medicines and accepts traditional health insurance.</p><p>It is gearing up to start manufacturing drugs early next year out of a brand-new pharmaceutical plant in the Dallas neighborhood of Deep Ellum, surrounded by art galleries and rock clubs. It is in talks with employers and insurers to make its drugs more widely available, and has so far signed up Capital Blue Cross, a Pennsylvania health insurer. It's also talking with big pharmaceutical companies to start selling brand-name drugs.</p><p>Initially, the pharmacy was just another of the dozens of investments made each year by Mr. Cuban, but it has gradually come to occupy more and more of his time. Mr. Cuban, whose only title is co-founder, is in daily contact with the company's CEO, participating in negotiations with pharmaceutical supply-chain partners and troubleshooting problems when they arise.</p><p>\"There isn't a decision I'm not involved with or leading,\" Mr. Cuban says.</p><p>Mr. Cuban also promotes the pharmacy aggressively in television appearances and on Twitter, where he has 8.8 million followers and tweets a dozen or more times a day. His Twitter bio reads in part: \"Dunking on the pharma industry with @costplusdrugs.com.\"</p><p>\"We have zigged and zagged a lot to get to where we are today, but building a business is never a straight line, so it's no surprise,\" Mr. Cuban says. </p><p>Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. has built a brand-new pharmaceutical plant in Dallas.

A number of ventures that have formed in recent years to respond to widespread demand for more affordable drugs, a long-running problem that has defied solution to date despite widespread discontent.</p><p>Rivals say that Mr. Cuban isn't doing much new except using his celebrity to promote a service that others have long provided.</p><p>\"He is a branding machine,\" said Susan Lang, CEO of XIL Health, a consulting and technology firm that earlier this year launched a drug-discount card company for patients buying drugs at retail pharmacies. \"I don't see where the disruption is really coming from other than he can market it a lot better than the rest of us.\"</p><p>Although the pharmacy has taken off faster than its founders expected, its work filling prescriptions is just a fraction of the overall market. CVS Health Corp., for instance, filled around 330 million mail-order prescriptions last year.</p><p>And to date, the Cuban pharmacy is limited to filling prescriptions for generic drugs, which are already the most affordable kinds of medicines. Even advocates for transparency in drug pricing say its impact will be blunted unless it expands its product offerings to include high-cost branded medicines.</p><p>\"For many patients, the drugs that they are most concerned about affording are actually the brand-name drugs…really expensive, helpful medicines that cost a lot out-of-pocket,\" said Hussain Lalani, a primary-care doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who recently co-wrote a study estimating that Medicare could have saved $3.6 billion using the Cuban pharmacy over one year. \"Unfortunately, this company is focusing on generic drugs currently, and does not offer any savings to patients in need of brand-name drugs.\"</p><p>Mr. Cuban became a billionaire in 1999 after selling his company Broadcast.com, an early pioneer in online video and audio streaming, to Yahoo Inc. for $5.7 billion. Less than a year later, he paid $280 million to buy the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p>Today, he is best known for \"Shark Tank,\" the reality-TV series in which Mr. Cuban and other investors evaluate pitches from budding entrepreneurs seeking funding. He co-owns Magnolia Pictures, an independent film distributor of movies including \"RBG,\" the Oscar-nominated documentary about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He estimates that he invests in 50 to 100 companies a year, and his portfolio includes OpenSea, an online exchange for trading nonfungible tokens, and cookie company Alyssa's Bakery.</p><p>The Cuban pharmacy is clearly a work in progress. Beyond filling prescriptions for generic drugs, the company also wants to make some medicines, and it is trying to persuade pharmaceutical companies to let it sell brand-name drugs with a comparatively low markup.</p><p>Pharma companies are interested in working with the Cuban pharmacy but are concerned about running afoul of federal rules requiring Medicare and Medicaid to get the lowest price of any customer, says Ron Harrison, vice president of business development.</p><p>Until recently, Dr. Oshmyansky and a handful of employees worked out of small rented offices in a Dallas co-working space called the Genius Den. Nearby, a small team dressed in yellow hazard vests and hard hats worked out of a construction trailer while overseeing the erection of a $30 million pharmaceutical-manufacturing plant that is scheduled to be operational early next year, pending regulatory inspections.</p><p>The plant will initially make drugs needed by hospitals that are in short supply, which under federal law aren't required to undergo the Food and Drug Administration approval process. But the company intends to make its own generic drugs that would undergo FDA review.</p><p>Several startups are attempting to reinvent parts of the pharmaceutical supply chain, removing costs by taking control of reimbursement, manufacturing and distribution.</p><p>Some firms, like ProvideGx and Civica Rx, are making drugs themselves so that they can control pricing and supply volumes. Others are selling directly to patients, bypassing the middleman known as pharmacy-benefit managers that traditionally handle drug coverage for health insurers.</p><p>A radiologist and former math prodigy, Dr. Oshmyansky received his undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder at age 18, followed by an M.D. from Duke University and a Ph.D. in math from Oxford. He had the idea for a pharmacy after growing frustrated with pharmaceutical-industry pricing practices, such as companies hiking prices dramatically on decades-old drugs.</p><p>He planted the seed for the Cuban pharmacy in 2015 when he founded Osh's Not-for-Profit Pharmaceuticals with a mission of manufacturing generic drugs and selling them to hospitals at a small markup on its costs. </p><p>Alex Oshmyansky started what would eventually become the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. after growing frustrated with pharmaceutical-industry pricing practices.

In 2018, he secured $1 million from investors through the Silicon Valley startup-incubator Y Combinator.</p><p>A few months later, in 2018, Dr. Oshmyansky emailed Mr. Cuban at his publicly available email address.</p><p>Mr. Cuban replied almost immediately, Dr. Oshmyansky said. They corresponded a few more times that same night, and Mr. Cuban said he would have an employee who handles his venture-capital investments vet Dr. Oshmyansky's startup.</p><p>Soon after, Mr. Cuban agreed to make an initial investment in the low six figures, says Dr. Oshmyansky.</p><p>Within six months, Mr. Cuban started becoming more interested in the company's progress, and agreed to an additional, larger investment that topped $1 million, Dr. Oshmyansky says.</p><p>Eventually, Dr. Oshmyansky agreed to rename the company after Mr. Cuban in a bid to trade on his celebrity and attract free publicity.</p><p>The company launched last year with an ambitious plan to become an all-in-one pharmaceutical supplier, combining manufacturing, distribution and drug-benefit services under one roof.</p><p>Mr. Cuban has become increasingly active in day-to-day operations, he and Dr. Oshmyansky say.</p><p>\"He's now a full-time employee, basically,\" he says. \"He's just around, which is a bit surreal. You see him on TV growing up and now it's like, 'Oh, he's here. Every day.' \"</p><p>Dr. Oshmyansky says the company is considering ways to offer its drugs at local retail pharmacies for patients who don't like mail-order. Yet in other areas, the company has downsized its ambitions, such as abandoning its plan to create its own pharmacy-benefit manager, or PBM.</p><p>The startup is taking on multiple, highly complex and regulated areas of the drug-supply chain without the hefty staffing and financial resources of the industry's biggest players, says Christopher Dietz, a chemical engineer who was hired last year to complete the manufacturing site's construction.</p><p>\"At first, I thought, 'Did we bite off more than we can chew?' \" says Mr. Dietz, vice president of engineering, facilities and construction management. \"I was a little skeptical, but now I think we can pull it off.\" </p><p>Dr. Oshmyansky walking through the online pharmacy's new manufacturing facility, which is initially to make drugs needed by hospitals that are in short supply.
