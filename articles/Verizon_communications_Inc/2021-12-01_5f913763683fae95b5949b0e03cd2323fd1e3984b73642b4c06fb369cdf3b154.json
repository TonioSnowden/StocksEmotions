  "title": "Business News:  Activist Urges Zendesk to Ditch SurveyMonkey Deal  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Jana Partners LLC owns a big stake in Zendesk Inc. and is urging the customer-service platform to abandon a deal it struck to buy the parent of web-survey company SurveyMonkey. </p><p>   The New York activist urged Zendesk's board to terminate the acquisition of Momentive Global Inc. now rather than wait months for a shareholder vote that appears likely to fail, according to a letter sent Tuesday to the company's board. </p><p>   Zendesk shares closed up 7.4% Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter, which Jana has since released publicly. Momentive's shares closed down 3.1%. </p><p>   Zendesk in late October agreed to buy Momentive in an all-stock deal that at the time was valued at about $4.1 billion. Zendesk, with a market value of about $11.5 billion, specializes in helping companies with customer communications, while SurveyMonkey facilitates the design and implementation of web-based surveys. The firms have said that by combining, they could help companies get better feedback from customers. </p><p>   But investors and analysts are skeptical. Zendesk's shares were down a total of 20% since the announcement, as of the close Monday, despite better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and fourth-quarter projections released when the deal was announced. Momentive shares were down about 15% over that period. </p><p>   Jana wrote that the Momentive deal \"lacks financial merit, has questionable strategic logic, and introduces a high degree of execution risk for Zendesk shareholders.\" It would also diminish what Jana believes would be buyer interest in Zendesk, according to the investor. Jana said it plans to vote its shares against the issuance of Zendesk stock that would be needed to pay for the deal and could seek to replace board members. </p><p>   Momentive shareholders are to receive 0.225 Zendesk share for each Momentive share. The deal is valued at roughly $3.2 billion based on Monday's closing prices, or $21.40 a share compared with $28 when it was announced. It requires signoff from both sets of investors. </p><p>   Although merger activity is booming, shareholders in some cases lately have revolted against deals they view as ill-conceived. In September, investors in Five9 Inc. voted down a planned acquisition by video-conferencing-software company Zoom Video Communications Inc. that was initially valued at nearly $15 billion. Zoom's shares had declined almost 30% between the merger's proposal and its cancellation. </p><p></p>",
