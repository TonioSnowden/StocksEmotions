  "text": "<p>The Shenzhen-based electronics giant had demanded that the American cellphone carrier pay it fees for the use of dozens of patents. Verizon has previously called the allegations meritless.</p><p>\"Verizon is happy with the settlement reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits,\" the U.S. company said Monday. \"While terms of the settlement are not being disclosed, our team did an outstanding job bringing this protracted matter to a close.\"</p><p>A Huawei spokesman confirmed the settlement ended litigation between the two companies. News of the settlement was earlier reported by Reuters.</p><p>Huawei is the world's largest maker of equipment that forms the backbone of the modern internet as well as a large manufacturer of mobile phones and other consumer electronics.</p><p>The company has become a flashpoint in a geopolitical fight between the U.S. and China over leadership in technologies considered important to both superpowers' economic clout.</p><p>Huawei still faces a court battle over the extradition from Canada of finance chief Meng Wanzhou to the U.S., which has accused the executive of criminal charges related to the Chinese company's alleged violation of sanctions against Iran.
