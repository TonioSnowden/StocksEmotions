  "text": "<p>\"It is more of a relaxed feeling,\" Ms. Cheng said, comparing it to other videoconferencing platforms. \"Even if everyone is in the same room, not everyone's video shows up on your screen. It is supposed to imitate real life.\"</p><p>As the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to many social gatherings and business meetings, a crop of small technology firms this year emerged with the aim of diversifying or reinventing the video-call experience. Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Teams were leaders in the space, but others tried to add on to the experience, creating virtual worlds or making the format more dynamic.</p><p>Platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams added new security enhancements and other features to make the typical video call more interactive. This past summer, Zoom and DTEN Inc. unveiled a $599 touch-screen device with the video-chat software preinstalled. Zoom is testing other enhancements, including a feature called OnZoom that would function as a marketplace to find virtual events.</p><p>More updates are on the horizon, particularly to address a hybrid work environment where people split time between working at home and in the office, said Esther Yoon, group manager for product marketing at Zoom.</p><p>\"We're going to have to make sure that whether you're in the office or whether you're working from home your voice has equal weight,\" Ms. Yoon said.</p><p>Zoom's competitors have made similar product updates. Microsoft Teams added a feature called \"Together Mode\" in July that aims to re-create the feeling of being in a room together over video and removing the gallery view. Fans who wanted to watch National Basketball Association games this past season used Together Mode to do so. Alphabet Inc.'s Google Meet in September introduced a whiteboard feature and a blurring tool to let users wash out their background.</p><p>But while many of the major videoconferencing companies have shown impressive growth and demand, there will be room for industry-specific video chatting tools and platforms, said Brianne Kimmel, founder and managing partner of Worklife Ventures, a venture fund that invests in companies creating work tools.</p><p>\"In the short term, Zoom is still the category leader when it comes to the majority of professional calls,\" Ms. Kimmel said. \"Where I see a lot of innovation happening are more on the personal calls, or new experiences that kind of sit at the intersection of work and life.\"</p><p>Many startups have popped up as well to address the growing usage of video chatting. Gather and Sophya.AI, a product from Sage Learning Inc., both offer a virtual world mixed in with videoconferencing. Gather lets users customize their spaces, allowing them to re-create apartments or campuses in a virtual setting. Sophya creates personalized models for the companies that want them.</p><p>Part of what the startups are trying to solve for is an issue called \"Zoom fatigue\" many people feel, which is perpetuated by only seeing other people's heads, said Chris Ross, vice president, analyst at Gartner Inc.</p>",
