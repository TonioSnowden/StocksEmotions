ZM and DocuSign Inc. DOCU rocketing during lockdowns realized they couldn't go up forever. But they also didn't know how long the initial lockdown period would last, and they might have been afraid of missing out. Investors or traders might have scored tidy profits if they jumped on the bandwagon and got off in time.</p><p>Getting back to Peloton, the share price price more than doubled during the first half of 2020.
