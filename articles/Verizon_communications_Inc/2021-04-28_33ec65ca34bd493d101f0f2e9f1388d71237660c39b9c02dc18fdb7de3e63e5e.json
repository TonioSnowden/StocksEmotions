  "text": "<p>Verizon splashed out billions of dollars assembling a portfolio of once-dominant websites, including AOL in 2015, and Yahoo in 2017, paying more than $9 billion in total to acquire the pair.</p><p>Verizon, the country's largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers, bought the websites intending to resurrect brands that had lost traffic since their heyday but still counted a base of hundreds of millions of account holders.</p><p>It reorganized the businesses in 2017 under former AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong, dubbing the combined division \"Oath\" and signaling its intention to go head to head with digital-advertising powerhouses like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>Yahoo and AOL, born during the age of desktop PCs hooked up to dial-up Internet connections, managed to capture more ad dollars but struggled to reach audiences that had shifted their attention to mobile apps.</p><p>The digital-media business ultimately failed to reach its target of $10 billion in annual revenue by 2020, and Verizon in 2018 wrote down about $4.5 billion of its value . Verizon has cut jobs in the unit, and in November agreed to sell its HuffPost news division to BuzzFeed Inc. That followed a 2019 agreement to sell the Tumblr blogging platform  for a nominal sum to the owner of WordPress.</p><p>The business, which also includes Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Mail as well as news sites TechCrunch and Engadget, generated $7 billion of revenue in 2020, down 5.6% from the previous year due to a sharp advertising pullback during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. Business picked up in the second half and the unit has logged two consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, including a boost of 10%, to $1.9 billion, in the first quarter.</p><p>Despite the rebound, Verizon has focused much of its attention lately on partnerships with streaming-video services like Disney+ and Hulu that can be bundled with its wireless and home-Internet plans.</p><p>By selling now, Verizon could raise needed cash  at a time when valuations of similar assets are enjoying an upswing. The company this year committed about $53 billion to secure spectrum licenses that will support its ultrafast fifth-generation wireless network. Executives recently told investors that capital spending this year on network equipment, fiber optic cables and the like could reach up to $21.5 billion.</p><p>Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com  and Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com  and Miriam Gottfried at</p><p>Verizon Explores Sale of Media Assets, Including Parts of Yahoo and AOL</p>",
