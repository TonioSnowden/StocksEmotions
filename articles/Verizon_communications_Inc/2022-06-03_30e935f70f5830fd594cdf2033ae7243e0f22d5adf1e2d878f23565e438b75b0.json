  "title": "Microsoft Cuts Its Forecasts,  Citing Effect of Strong Dollar  ----  By Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>   Microsoft Corp. cut sales and earnings guidance for the current quarter, citing the impact of foreign-exchange rates as the stronger U.S. dollar takes a toll. </p><p>   The disclosure by the software giant, in a securities filing Thursday, comes as economic weakness in other parts of the world has helped propel the dollar to multidecade highs against its trading partners. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, is up more than 6% so far this year and hit its highest level since 2002 last month. The dollar's climb has sent the euro, British pound and Japanese yen tumbling. </p><p>   A strong dollar allows Americans to buy goods from other countries at lower prices. But it can also hurt U.S. manufacturers by making products more expensive for foreigners, and it means U.S. businesses receive fewer dollars for their exports. </p><p>   Microsoft said it now expects fiscal fourth-quarter sales of between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion, down from its prior guidance of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion. Earnings are expected to be between $2.24 and $2.32 a share, down from prior guidance of $2.28 a share to $2.35 a share. </p><p>   Microsoft shares rose 0.8% to $274.58 a share despite the announcement, on a strong day overall for stocks. </p><p>   The dollar has benefited from its status as a haven for investors during tumultuous financial markets and from the Federal Reserve's promise to quell inflation by raising rates. Money managers typically buy currencies linked to countries where central banks are raising interest rates to rein in a hot economy. </p><p>   Asset managers have also been scooping up the dollar, boosting its value, as a bet on the resilience of the U.S. economy compared with Europe and the U.K., where economic data have pointed to slow growth. The British pound and the euro both have dropped over 6% so far this year. </p><p>   Microsoft said in its April earnings report  that a stronger dollar reduced the software company's revenue and earnings by $302 million and 3 cents a share, respectively. </p><p>   Microsoft is the latest multinational company to warn of the stronger dollar's impact on financials. Salesforce Inc. earlier this week cited the stronger dollar in lowering its sales outlook for the year. The business-software company doubled the impact that it expects this year from the stronger dollar to $600 million from its $300 million forecast in March. </p><p>   \"I think the dollar might have even had a stronger quarter than we did,\" Salesforce Co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff said on the company's conference call Tuesday. </p><p>   Drug companies that sell medicine and medical products in international markets also have taken a hit. In late April, pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. said foreign-exchange effects dented sales by 1.3% in the first quarter of this year -- and that was before the dollar crested at recent highs last month. For the full year, AbbVie forecast that the rising dollar would hurt sales by 1.4%. </p><p>   Last month, Deere &amp; Co., the big maker of farm and construction equipment, also warned a stronger dollar would likely hurt its sales. </p><p>   The stock market has reacted, punishing companies with large sources of non-U.S. revenue. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index has dropped about 17% this year, compared with the broad S&amp;P 500 index's 12% decline. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, which includes companies more dependent on domestic sales, has lost just 7%. </p><p>   That U.S.-revenue index includes companies such as health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc., telecoms giant Verizon Communications Inc. and U.S.-centric retailers like Home Depot Inc. and Walmart Inc. </p><p>   Microsoft has already sounded a note of caution because of the current economic environment. Last month, the Redmond, Wash., company said it would slow down the pace of hiring employees for its software group because of growing uncertainties, joining other tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. in scaling back hiring plans. </p><p>   On Thursday, Microsoft also lowered its gross-margin guidance to a range of $35.45 billion to $36.05 billion, down from between $35.8 billion and $36.4 billion. Operating income is now expected to be between $20.60 billion and $21.30 billion, down from a range of $20.90 billion to $21.60 billion. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Matt Grossman contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
