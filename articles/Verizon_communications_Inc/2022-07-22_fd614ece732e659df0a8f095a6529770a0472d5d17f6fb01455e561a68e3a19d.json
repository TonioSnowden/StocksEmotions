  "text": "<p>\"We do see in times of economic stress customers managing their payments more tightly,\" Pascal Desroches, AT&amp;T's finance chief, said.</p><p>Rising interest rates and higher prices on everything from gasoline to groceries this year have pressured consumer sentiment even as consumer spending has largely held up. Some chief executives, including leaders at PepsiCo Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc., have warned in recent weeks that they expect a spending slowdown this year and see a higher chance of a recession.</p><p>Speaking on a conference call with analysts Thursday, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey stopped short of predicting a recession, calling the business environment \"not easy to predict,\" but said that the company was prepared to respond to one. Inflation has burdened AT&amp;T with higher costs for equipment while some of its customers struggle with more expensive household basics.</p><p>\"I hate to describe it this way, but I think we got a little bit of a tale of two cities going on here, and when you see 9% inflation, it tends to hit those in the low end of the market really, really hard,\" Mr. Stankey said.</p><p>Those pressures did little to curb AT&amp;T's growth during the June quarter. The telecom company reported a net gain of 813,000 postpaid phone connections in the June quarter, topping the average 400,000 projection from analysts polled by FactSet. Investors tend to watch postpaid wireless plans, which charge customers for monthly service after it is rendered, to gauge a cellphone carrier's core growth.</p><p>The gains came at a cost as promotions, capital investments and customers' late payments sapped the amount of cash generated by the business.</p><p>AT&amp;T lowered its 2022 free cash-flow target and its shares dropped 7.6% to $18.93 Thursday. Shares of rivals T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. each slipped about 3%.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon both tested customers' wallets this summer by raising rates for some older wireless services and urging users to upgrade to unlimited-data plans. The first price increases started in June, near the tail end of the second quarter.</p><p>That wireless subscriptions still rose suggests that many AT&amp;T customers were willing to absorb the rate changes despite surging prices for other household expenses such as food and fuel. Verizon is scheduled to post its second-quarter results Friday, followed by T-Mobile US next week.</p><p>The new mobile customers helped AT&amp;T raise its estimate of this year's wireless service revenue growth to between 4.5% and 5%, above its earlier forecast of 3% or better. Smartphone promotions have attracted droves of customers to AT&amp;T's main business over the past two years, allowing the company to sometimes outrun fast-growing T-Mobile.</p><p>The company lowered its 2022 free-cash-flow target by $2 billion to $14 billion, citing \"working capital impacts and higher subscriber growth.\" Some of that decrease came from its offers on new smartphones, which made the company spend more cash upfront to grab valuable long-term customers.</p><p>Customers making later payments accounted for about $1 billion of the cash-flow decrease.</p>",
