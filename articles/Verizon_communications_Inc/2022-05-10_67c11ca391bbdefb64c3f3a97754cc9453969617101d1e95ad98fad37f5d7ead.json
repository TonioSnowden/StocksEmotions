  "text": "<p>President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced the providers' enhanced plans at the White House on Monday alongside telecom executives and members of Congress.</p><p>\"High-speed internet is not a luxury any longer -- it's a necessity,\" Mr. Biden said. He said people can call (877) 384-2575 or visit getinternet.gov to find out if they qualify for the program.</p><p>Many of the companies, which cover more than 80% of the U.S. population, agreed Monday to either boost the internet speeds that they offer through the program or to cut their rates to $30 a month for low-income and other households that qualify.</p><p>At that price, a high-speed internet plan is effectively free for households that qualify for the subsidy, said a spokesman for AT&amp;T, which offers such a plan.</p><p>Other internet providers said their subsidized broadband plans already met those criteria but committed to make it easier to sign up for service in stores and by phone.</p><p>In addition to AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon's Fios service, other participating providers include Cox Communications Inc., Charter Communications Inc., Frontier Communications Corp. and regional providers such as Jackson Energy Authority in Tennessee, Comporium Inc. in the Carolinas and Vermont Telephone Co.</p><p>During his Monday remarks, Mr. Biden spoke about broadband services as a necessity and pointed to the plight of families who park in fast-food parking lots to access wireless internet during the pandemic. \"It's just not right,\" he said.</p><p>The lower rates are backed by a $65 billion program to build up the country's broadband network through the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure law approved by Congress in 2021. While most of the broadband funds will be awarded to states and territories for fiber-optic-cable projects, the law also provides $14 billion to pay for the Affordable Connectivity Program.</p>",
