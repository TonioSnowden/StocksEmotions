  "text": "<p>Nokia will cut up to 10,000 jobs as the telecoms equipment maker tries to regain its competitiveness after losing out in the early rounds of 5G networks to Huawei and Ericsson.</p> <p>The Finnish group on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/03/16/nokia-announces-plans-to-reset-its-cost-base-to-invest-in-future-capabilities/\">said</a> it would have 80,000-85,000 employees within two years, down from 90,000 today, as part of a “reset” of its cost position that would allow it to boost R&amp;D investment.</p> <p>Nokia maintained its financial guidance for this year but warned the job losses would cost it €600m-€700m in restructuring charges up to 2023, with half of that coming in 2021.</p> <p>Pekka Lundmark, Nokia's new chief executive, has stressed that the company will do “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/847d753d-9c0a-4b53-b1bb-47e7484e0950\">whatever it takes</a>” to win in the 5G era. </p> <p>On Tuesday he said: “In those areas where we choose to compete, we will play to win. We are therefore enhancing product quality and cost competitiveness, and investing in the right skills and capabilities.”</p> <p>Nokia has winnowed down its employee base from a peak of 132,000 in 2010 when it was still the world's largest mobile phone maker, despite consolidating the telecoms equipment market by rolling up rivals including Alcatel-Lucent and divisions of Siemens, Motorola and Panasonic. </p> <p>The group was caught flat-footed by the initial rollout of 5G networks as it was still digesting its €15.6bn takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. In recent years it has struggled financially compared with Sweden's Ericsson and China's Huawei.</p> <p>Nokia is preparing to update investors on its new strategy under Lundmark at a capital markets day on Thursday.</p> <p>Dominik Olszewski, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that with Nokia having cut 11,000 jobs in the past two years, some investors had been looking for technology-led growth signs from the company rather than more cost-cutting. </p> <p>Nokia was expected to be a beneficiary of the global <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8807ddb-8e43-438f-b892-db42120c7a47\">political pressure</a> on telecoms companies to stop using Huawei and ZTE equipment for 5G networks. While it has won some share in Europe, the company recently lost out when an important contract in the US with Verizon went to rival Samsung last year. </p> <p>The Espoo-headquartered group has staked its future on greater R&amp;D investment in its core networking business while cutting spending in services and consulting. That is a similar recovery strategy to the one applied by Ericsson's management five years ago when the Swedish company ousted its chief executive and launched a restructuring plan. </p> <p>Nokia's cloud and networking services division was singled out by the group as where it will focus its efforts. It will also reduce investment in older technologies at its mobile networks business.&#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>It struck cloud partnerships with Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud this week to develop new 5G and enterprise products for the telecoms market. </p> <p>Nokia shares were up 0.6 per cent to €3.64 in midday trading. </p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent and Nic Fildes, Telecoms Correspondent 2021 'Nokia warns of up to 10,000 job losses' FT.com 16 March.
