  "text": "<p>While Meta Materials appears to have no relation to Facebook Inc., it soon will have a similar corporate name. Facebook is changing its name to Meta, a ploy aimed at better positioning the company around the metaverse.</p><p>Similar confusion has occurred in the past. Some investors put their money into Zoom Technologies last year, sending the stock higher, instead of investing into popular work-from-home videoconferencing service Zoom Video Communications Inc. It didn't help that Zoom Technologies' ticker is \"ZOOM.\"</p><p>The same thing happened when retail investors were excited about movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Shares of AMC Networks Inc., which has a similar ticker to AMC Entertainment, also rose. AMC Networks is an entertainment company whose brands include AMC and IFC.</p><p>Facebook announced its name changeon Thursday as it faces scrutiny from lawmakers, users and researchers. The Wall Street Journal recently published a series of investigative storiesdetailing how the company knew its platforms were harmful in some ways and didn't fix them.</p><p>Meta Materials, meanwhile, is different. The Nova Scotia-based company has a technology platform to help brands with products in areas such as 5G communications and consumer electronics.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Meta Shares Surge.
