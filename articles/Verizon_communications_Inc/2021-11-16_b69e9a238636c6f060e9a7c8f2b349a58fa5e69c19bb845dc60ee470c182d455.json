  "text": "<p>Apple AAPL products are so popular that the company doesn't typically post Black Friday or holiday-season sales until the last minute. And even then the push is pretty chill. While many third-party retailers (slightly) discount some devices, Apple Stores and the website maintain their low-key demeanor.</p><p>But there are ways to get an Apple Black Friday deal. Here's what we've found.</p><p>What are Apple's Black Friday 2021 store hours?</p><p>Apple Store hours vary by location. For example, the Fifth Avenue store in New York is always open. Other locations have more typical hours — opening at 8 or 10 a.m. and closing in the early evening. Store hours can also depend on local health and safety measures, according to the Apple Store website.</p><p>Use the store directory&#xa0;on Apple's website to find the operating hours of a location near you.</p><p>What are Apple's Black Friday 2021 deals?</p><p>Apple deals are volatile due to high demand and fluctuating inventory. So a discount or special offer can be gone soon after you find out about it.</p><p>Apple has recently posted the following deals on its website:</p><p>A 64GB iPad Mini for $499.</p><p>The Series 7 Apple Watch starts at $399.</p><p>The HomePod mini speaker, available in five colors for $99.</p><p>The 32GB 4K Apple TV starts at $179. (Remember, this is a component that requires an HD or better television.)</p><p>Notice the above deals don't mention price savings. Discounts are so not Apple. For those, you'll need to look to outside retailers. Some advertised deals so far:</p><p>Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones for $479 at&#xa0;Amazon&#xa0;($70 savings). Some models include six months of Apple Music free. Amazon AMZN had the same AirPods marked down to $429.98 at one point, but that price didn't last long.</p><p>Amazon has also marked AirPods Pro earbuds as low as $189.99 to $199.99 (savings of $49.01 to $59.01). There's that price volatility we mentioned.</p><p>A MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display and 16GB memory for $2,299.99 at&#xa0;Best BuyBBY ($500 savings).</p><p>Nerdy tip:&#xa0;Apple has a handy&#xa0;order by date chart&#xa0;so that you'll know the latest date you can place a holiday order for a specific item and get free home delivery. Some Apple Store locations offer pickup as well as next-day and two-hour delivery.</p><p>Also see:Apple planning iPhone feature that could detect car crashes and automatically dial 911: WSJ</p><p>How to save money at Apple</p><p>Since discounts are so skinny, how can you really save on Apple products? Consider buying certified refurbished. You can snag Macs, iPads, iPhones and all the other previous-generation Apples with savings that can run to hundreds of dollars. And the “like new” tech comes with a one-year warranty.</p><p>Other savings hacks:</p><p>Trade in your old gear (if eligible) and get a purchase credit applied to an Apple gift card to save even more.</p><p>The veterans and military purchase program allows a 10% discount to military-connected consumers and their immediate family members.</p><p>Use an Apple Card and get 3% cash back.</p><p>Look for carrier deals. For example, AT&amp;T T offers up to an $800 credit on a new iPhone 13 or 13 Pro after a trade-in. T-Mobile TMUS and Verizon VZ offer similar credits.</p><p>What were Apple's Black Friday 2020 deals?</p><p>Last year, Apple's Black Friday sale was a four-day event. Rather than offering a price discount, all of the deals we could find included an Apple gift card with a purchase. The only other advertised special was free personal engraving.</p><p>Also see:Good luck escaping inflation — the biggest contributors to the 31-year high include rent, gas and groceries</p><p>As usual, it fell to the major phone carriers and retailers to offer discounts in 2020, including:</p><p>AT&amp;T offered a credit of up to $700 on an eligible smartphone trade-in with an upgraded or new line and the purchase of an iPhone 12.</p><p>Best Buy had discounts up to $250 on select MacBook Pros and up to $150 on select iPad Pros.</p><p>Walmart WMT offered AirPods Pro for $169 ($50 savings) and Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) for $119 ($60 savings), both online only.</p><p>Amazon sold a 2017 model iPad Pro for $680.84 ($98.16 savings).</p><p>More From NerdWallet</p><p>Prices Are Skyrocketing: Here's How to Lessen the Impact</p><p>Air Fryer Black Friday 2021 Deals: Are They Worth It?</p><p>Care About Your Credit Score?
