  "text": "<p>\n  Brands had been toying with the metaverse for some time before Facebook's recent name change turned the term into a household word. Now some of them are getting serious. </p><p>\n  Companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and streetwear brand Vans earlier this year built their own digital worlds on metaverse-like platforms such as Roblox Corp. and Fortnite Creative in an attempt to improve brand recognition and get existing customers more engaged. </p><p>\n  Their efforts are a sign that advertisers, which have long been hesitant to spend marketing dollars on experimental efforts, are warming to new digital platforms. Facebook's late October announcement that it would develop a metaverse environment, including investing $10 billion on the effort this year and changing its name to Meta Platforms Inc., is expected to accelerate that trend. </p><p>\n  \"Facebook saying, 'We're going to put $10 billion into this,' I think provides a lot of incremental confidence that this would be a worthwhile experiment,\" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a media-buying company inside ad agency behemoth WPP PLC. </p><p>\n  The metaverse is a relatively new term to describe a futuristic internet with virtual experiences where people can customize avatars -- digital images representing themselves -- to play games, make virtual purchases and interact and attend events such as concerts and comedy shows. Roblox is  among the highest-profile metaverse-like platforms. </p><p>\n  This futuristic version of the internet is unlikely to become a significant branding platform for companies soon. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the metaverse was five to 10 years away from being developed and adopted by a large number of users. Marketing executives from companies present in the metaverse, including Vans and Chipotle, said they have yet to use the platform to sell physical goods. </p><p>\n  Chipotle has handed out discounted or free burritos to people in costumes around Halloween for the past two decades. This year, it chose to host its long-running \"boorito\" promotion in the metaverse. The Mexican-food chain turned to Roblox, where it built a virtual store where avatars could dress up in costumes such as a Chip Bag Ghost or Burrito Mummy and travel through a virtual maze to retrieve a code for a free burrito. It was Chipotle's first foray into the metaverse. </p><p>\n  \"We haven't tried to sell anything yet on Roblox, but certainly we would like to do some experimentation,\" said Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief marketing officer. </p><p>\n  Meta has reached out to some advertisers to discuss ad opportunities in the metaverse. One executive at a digital marketing firm said he plans to meet with Meta remotely, through the company's virtual-reality headset. Another agency executive said Meta is encouraging brands to use existing augmented reality features, such as Instagram filters that overlay real photos with special effects, to get comfortable with the types of advertising opportunities that will exist in the future. </p><p>\n  Vans, a unit of VF Corp. that sells skateboarding apparel and gear, in September launched a virtual skate park in Roblox, where users can try new tricks and earn points by hitting waffle-shaped floating coins while skating. They can use the points to redeem items such as virtual shoes and skateboard customizations. They can also use Robux, Roblox's currency, to buy more specific virtual items, such as customizable shoes. </p><p>\n  Vans said the virtual skate park has attracted more than 48 million visitors. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Patience Haggin contributed to this article. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Can It Live Longer </p><p>\n  Than Second Life? </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Some marketers are concerned that the metaverse may just be a repeat of Linden Lab's virtual world Second Life, said Kieley Taylor, global head of partnerships at GroupM. </p><p>\n  Second Life, a community made up of islands and avatars developed by individuals and businesses, launched in the early 2000s to much fanfare from advertisers, but never really had a meaningful enough user base to stay relevant or grow large enough for brands to benefit, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a media-buying company within WPP PLC. </p><p>\n  Others believe things will be different this time around. </p><p>\n  Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief marketing officer, said he expects consumers to welcome a more immersive web experience, especially after pandemic confinements led them to change their habits. </p><p>\n  \"Being at home, using avatars, having the ability to get everything delivered to your home -- that changes the way people think about digital,\" Mr. Brandt said. \"I think the world is more ready for it.\" </p><p></p>",
