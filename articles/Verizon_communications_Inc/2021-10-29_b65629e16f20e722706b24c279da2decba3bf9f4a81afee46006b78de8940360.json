  "title": "FAA Plans Warnings to Pilots, Airlines Over New 5G Rollout; Air-safety regulators tussle with telecom regulators over safety concerns ahead of expansion of new wireless technology planned in December",
  "text": "<p>The cockpit systems, commonplace in modern air travel, help planes land in poor weather, prevent crashes and avoid midair collisions.The FAA has determined that if commercial pilots aren't able to use the features, that could lead to flight cancellations, delays or diversions in 46 of the country's largest metropolitan areas where the towers are located, these officials said.</p><p>Officials at the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates commercial use of the airwaves, and the telecom industry have pushed back on the safety concerns, saying the available evidence doesn't support the conclusion that 5G networks will interfere with aviation. The FCC set its rules for use of the spectrum in early 2020 after reviewing the potential impact on aviation, paving the way for Verizon Communications Inc. and others to roll out service.</p><p>The FAA officials' safety concerns aren't satisfied, current and former government officials said. The FCC and FAA are discussing the issue, and air-safety regulators could eventually decide to issue more targeted warnings that could result in fewer travel disruptions, these officials said.</p><p>The FAA's planned warnings are part of a long-running dispute between the aviation and telecom industries and their regulators. There have been disagreements over the seriousness of potential safety risks, data sharing and the quality of research, fueling a disconnect between efforts to protect aircraft and expand the latest wireless networks.</p><p>An FCC spokeswoman said the telecom regulator remains committed to ensuring air safety \"while moving forward with the deployment of new technologies that support American business and consumer needs.\"</p><p>An FAA spokesman said the agency was working with other government officials \"so that aviation and the newest generation of 5G cellular technology can safely coexist.\"</p><p>Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.</p><p>FAA Plans Warnings to Pilots, Airlines Over New 5G Rollout</p>",
