  "title": "Apollo Swings to a Profit  As Value Strategy Pays Off  ----  By Miriam Gottfried",
  "text": "<p>   Apollo Global Management Inc. reported a first-quarter profit as the value of its investments soared. </p><p>   The New York firm posted net income of $678.9 million, or $2.81 a share, compared with a loss of $996.2 million, or $4.47 a share, a year earlier when the coronavirus-fueled market downturn hit the value of its investments. </p><p>   Apollo's private-equity portfolio appreciated 22% during the quarter, beating out rivals and easily topping the S&amp;P 500, which climbed 5.8% during the period. The gains were broad-based and came as the firm's value-oriented investment strategy began to pay off. </p><p>   In the latest example of that strategy, which often involves polishing up underperforming assets and accelerating their growth, the firm announced a deal on Monday to buy Yahoo and AOL from Verizon Communications Inc. for $5 billion. </p><p>   Apollo also posted record fee-related earnings of $286.7 million in the first quarter, up 26% from a year earlier. </p><p>   Shares of Apollo edged down 0.13% Tuesday. </p><p>   Apollo in March announced a deal to buy the 65% of insurance affiliate Athene Holding Ltd. that it doesn't already own. Later that month, co-founder Marc Rowan formally assumed the role of chief executive officer of Apollo, taking over from longtime CEO Leon Black, who stepped down after revelations of Mr. Black's ties to the late, disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. </p><p>   Taking full ownership of Athene will pave the way for Apollo's credit business to double over the next five years, Mr. Rowan recently told The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   He also said its two other segments, private equity and real assets, could together grow more than 50% over the period. </p><p>   Assets climbed to $461.1 billion in the first quarter, up from $455.5 billion in the prior period and $315.5 billion a year earlier. </p><p>   \"We are in a growth business. This quarter and the year-over-year results make this abundantly clear,\" Mr. Rowan said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. \"We are exceptionally good at generating excess returns across a very broad swath of the risk-return spectrum from investment grade to private equity.\" </p><p>   In private equity, for example, the firm has had gross returns of 39%, or 24% after fees, over the past 31 years, with each of its main funds having generated performance-related fees known as carried interest. Mr. Rowan called this \"an incredible track record,\" and said it puts the firm's performance substantially ahead of the top quartile of private-equity peers. </p><p>   Mr. Rowan also received a question from an analyst about the roles and responsibilities of the firm's leadership, given that Mr. Black had left the company and co-founder Josh Harris, who previously oversaw Apollo's day-to-day operations, wasn't on the call. </p><p>   As CEO, Mr. Rowan said he is in charge of the firm's strategy, culture and compensation, communication and tackling of urgent initiatives and problems that might arise, while co-Presidents James Zelter and Scott Kleinman run the day-to-day of Apollo's business. \"Josh is an active and productive and senior member of the Apollo team,\" Mr. Rowan said of Mr. Harris. </p><p></p>",
