  "text": "<p>The German company already has majority voting power in the U.S. wireless carrier.</p><p>The telecom giant's stake in T-Mobile is at about 48.4%, Chief Executive Tim Hottges told analysts in an earnings call on Thursday. Once majority ownership is reached, it is possible the German company could further increase its stake in T-Mobile or participate in a share buyback, Mr. Hottges added.</p><p>The disclosure came as Deutsche Telekom raised its guidance for the second time this year, citing in part the performance of T-Mobile.</p><p>The U.S. company reported gains in wireless postpaid phone customers, considered a reliable measure of a wireless company's performance because it tracks monthly bill payers.</p><p>Its growth in customer base fell slightly short of rival AT&amp;T Inc., but both outperformed Verizon Communications Inc., which has the largest wireless subscriber base in the country.</p><p>T-Mobile's business in the U.S. accounted for about two-thirds of Deutsche Telekom's net revenue in the second quarter.</p><p>Deutsche Telekom shares gained about 0.4% in Thursday trading in Germany, while T-Mobile shares slipped 0.9% in New York.</p>",
