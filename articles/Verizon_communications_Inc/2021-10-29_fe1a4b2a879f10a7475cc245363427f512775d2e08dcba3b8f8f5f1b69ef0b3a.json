  "title": "Zendesk, Momentive Shares Fall on Merger Plan, Indicating Investor Doubts; Deal would roll SurveyMonkey parent company into Zendesk's customer-service platform",
  "text": "<p>Zendesk shares fell 15% to $101.67 in the afternoon, while Momentive shares dropped 7.3% to $22.10. In the proposed all-stock deal, Momentive shareholders would get 0.225 Zendesk shares for each Momentive share that they own.</p><p>A deal to add Momentive and SurveyMonkey—a service that lets people design and implement web-based surveys—would be Zendesk's largest-ever acquisition. Zendesk estimated that the deal would help its earnings grow starting in 2023.</p><p>Its chairman and chief executive, Mikkel Asger Svane, said that SurveyMonkey has a strong design and good brand recognition.</p><p>\"You can never get the je ne sais quoi that is in that platform,\" Mr. Svane told analysts Thursday.</p><p>As shares fell on Friday, analysts suggested that investors' concerns could scuttle the deal. On Thursday, the companies said the agreement valued Momentive at about $4.13 billion, or about $28 a share, based on a recent volume-weighted average for Zendesk. But that valuation sinks as shares of Zendesk fall in price, raising the risk that the deal can't be completed, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analysts wrote.</p><p>Oppenheimer cut its rating on Zendesk after the deal was announced, as did analysts at Jefferies, Piper Sandler and Bank of America.</p><p>\"We are moving to the sidelines to re-evaluate our long-term view,\" Jefferies analysts wrote.</p><p>As Zendesk shares were trading lower in after-hours activity Thursday evening, Momentive Chief Executive Alexander J. Lurie told analysts that the price fall wasn't a threat to the deal.</p><p>\"I don't care what happens in the short-term movements,\" Mr. Lurie said. \"This team, and me in particular, is super, super committed to executing this transaction.\"</p><p>Representatives for Zendesk and Momentive said that leaders from the companies weren't available for interviews.</p><p>Adverse stock movements have recently scrapped other tech mergers. Last month, investors in Five9 Inc. voted down an acquisition bid from Zoom Video Communications Inc. that initially valued Five9 at nearly $15 billion. Zoom was trying to leverage its strong share price to buy Five9 after a run-up in Zoom's stock during the Covid-19 pandemic, but its shares declined 30% between the merger's proposal and its cancellation.</p><p>This week, PayPal Holdings Inc. also abandoned a bid to buy Pinterest Inc. amid a negative investor reaction. After its interest in pursuing the deal leaked, PayPal shares had fallen 12% in three days. That could have forced PayPal to offer more equity to Pinterest shareholders to complete the merger had negotiations continued.</p><p>Talks between DraftKings Inc. and Entain PLC about a merger of the gambling companies collapsed this week too, ending a plan DraftKings confirmed in September to buy Entain for about $22 billion. Since then, DraftKings shares had fallen more than 10%, indicating investors doubted the cash-and-stock deal's value.</p><p>Zendesk, Momentive Shares Fall on Merger Plan, Indicating Investor Doubts</p>",
