  "text": "<p>The company has failed, however, to attract many additional subscribers so far this year. Executives said they had to increase device subsidies and discounts to get more wireless customers, a development that ate into its profits.</p><p>Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told analysts Friday that the company wasn't satisfied with its performance and that while the competition for consumers' attention has intensified, the current level of promotions isn't sustainable.</p><p>\"I am confident that we have the right strategies in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves,\" Mr. Vestberg said.</p><p>The telecommunications giant gained 12,000 postpaid phone connections in the second quarter, a sign of relatively weak growth in its core customer base. Rival AT&amp;T Inc. reported a net gain of 813,000 equivalent connections over the same span. Investors tend to track subscribers on postpaid mobile plans, which charge customers for monthly service after it is rendered, to measure wireless-company growth.</p><p>The weaker-than-expected customer additions prompted executives to raise rates for some midprice plans in June. The company also raised the monthly cost of some metered-data plans by $6 to $12 and boosted some consumer-plan fees. It added another monthly \"economic adjustment charge\" of up to $2.20 per line for business plans.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said some of the rate increases could yield about $1 billion of additional revenue, though price-conscious customers leaving the service could chip into that gain.</p><p>All told, Verizon said it expects wireless-service revenue growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2022, down from its earlier forecast of a 9% to 10% increase. The company also predicted its adjusted earnings would be flat to negative instead of growing this year.</p><p>Shares fell 7% to $44.45 Friday. The stock is down about 15% this year, compared with a roughly 17% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Verizon posted a second-quarter net loss of 229,000 prepaid connections, a drop that excluded customers lost because of the shutdown of a 3G network that TracFone used.</p><p>In the June quarter, net income attributable to Verizon fell to $5.2 billion, down from $5.8 billion from the same period one year ago. On a per-share basis, its profit slipped to $1.24 from $1.40 a year earlier. Operating revenue was roughly flat from the previous year at $33.79 billion.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
