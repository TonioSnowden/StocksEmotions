  "title": "Mark Meadows Loses Bid to Avoid Testifying Before Jan. 6 House Panel; Judge denies former Trump chief of staff's challenge to subpoena demanding his testimony before select committee",
  "text": "<p>Judge Nichols ruled that Mr. Meadows's lawsuit is barred by the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress from civil lawsuits in some contexts.</p><p>Judge Nichols, a Trump appointee, said the subpoenas were the sort of legislative acts shielded by the Speech or Debate Clause.</p><p>\"We will review the decision and decide on any further steps,\" said George Terwilliger, a lawyer for Mr. Meadows.</p><p>Mr. Meadows initially cooperated with the select committee, providing it communications and documents he determined weren't protected by executive privilege, including over 2,300 text messages from his personal devices.</p><p>Lawmakers previously disclosed some text messages between Mr. Meadows and some allies during the Capitol attack, in which they had implored Mr. Meadows to press Mr. Trump to intervene to stop the rioters.</p><p>Mr. Meadows's lawyer communicated to the committee last year that his client was willing to appear voluntarily at a deposition, so long as he could decline to expose information he believed was protected by executive privilege, a legal doctrine that shields some White House communications from disclosure.</p><p>Mr. Meadows later changed course, saying he wouldn't appear for the deposition. He said testifying was untenable in part because the committee had issued a subpoena to Verizon, his phone carrier, without notifying him.</p><p>In an August court filing, Mr. Meadows criticized the Select Committee for publicly disclosing the text messages he had voluntarily produced.</p><p>\"Mr. Meadows provided the Select Committee thousands of documents it could have reviewed and attempted to legislate on, but instead its members have waged a public campaign against Mr. Meadows, exposing his private documents for purposes of exploitation, self-aggrandizement, and political gain,\" his attorneys wrote in the filing.</p><p>The Democratic-controlled House voted in December to hold Mr. Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress after he defied the subpoena seeking his testimony. The House's move sent the matter to the Justice Department, which declined to prosecute Mr. Meadows.</p><p>The Justice Department has prosecuted two other former Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, for defying subpoenas issued by the Jan. 6 committee.</p><p>Mr. Bannon was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to four months in prison by Judge Nichols. Mr. Bannon is appealing his conviction, saying he was blocked from making key defenses, and will be allowed to exhaust his appeals before his sentence takes effect.</p><p>Mr. Navarro, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial next month.</p><p>Mr. Meadows has also sought to avoid testifying before a Georgia grand jury probing efforts of Mr. Trump and some allies to subvert President Biden's 2020 election victory in the state.</p><p>A state court judge in Pickens County, S.C., ruled last week that Mr. Meadows is a necessary witness in the investigation, rejecting arguments by the former Trump adviser that he isn't required under South Carolina law to testify.</p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has maintained in court that the Speech or Debate Clause protects him from having to testify before the same grand jury in Fulton County, Ga.</p><p>Last week, Justice Clarence Thomas temporarily blocked the grand jury from compelling Mr. Graham's testimony while the Supreme Court considers his claim of congressional immunity from the investigation. That ruling could come at any time.</p><p>â€”Sadie Gurman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>Mark Meadows Loses Bid to Avoid Testifying Before Jan. 6 House Panel</p>",
