  "title": "Business News:  AT&T Raises Its Forecasts  ---  Telecom profit is  growing as company  moves away from  entertainment  ----  By Omar Abdel-Baqui and Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>\n  AT&amp;T Inc. said its core telecommunications profit is growing even as its Hollywood footprint is about to shrink, underscoring its decision to leave the entertainment business over the coming year. </p><p>\n  The media and telecommunications giant said it is focusing on continuing to expand its broadband business and cellphone subscriber base while moving away from satellite-TV and media production. Ahead of that retreat, the company raised its full-year financial projections. The company now expects consolidated revenue growth between 2% and 3%, up from a prior target of about 1% growth. </p><p>\n  AT&amp;T in May decided to spin off its media brands -- including HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS and the Warner Bros. studio -- into a new publicly traded company with Discovery Inc. The move followed a February deal to spin off a 30% stake in AT&amp;T's pay-TV unit while giving up operational control of the business, which will be called DirecTV upon closing. </p><p>\n  \"We want to hit a strong exit velocity with both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands to respective opportunities for success,\" Chief Executive John Stankey said during a call with analysts. </p><p>\n  AT&amp;T also put much of its digital advertising business, known as Xandr, on the market in 2020. The company said Wednesday it will sell its remaining satellite-TV operations in Latin America, called Vrio, to Argentina's Grupo Werthein. The deal, slated to close in 2022, was expected to trigger a $4.6 billion accounting charge for AT&amp;T. </p><p>\n  On the entertainment side, WarnerMedia's HBO unit ended the quarter with 47 million domestic HBO and HBO Max subscribers, up from 44.2 million three months earlier. Those figures included new subscribers to HBO Max as well as customers paying for traditional HBO service, usually through a cable distributor. </p><p>\n  WarnerMedia revenue was up about 31% in the most recent quarter, reflecting a partial recovery from the impact of the pandemic as advertising sales returned. The entertainment company also highlighted higher content sales and more revenue from subscriptions as HBO Max grew. </p><p>\n  Overall net income attributable to AT&amp;T reached about $1.87 billion, or 21 cents a share, up from $1.23 billion, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier, when write-downs, severance costs and other accounting adjustments hurt earnings. Total revenue rose 7.6% to $44 billion. </p><p>\n  The company's reported net debt fell nearly $1 billion from about $169 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Chief Financial Officer Pascal Desroches said he expects the DirecTV stake sale to close next month, allowing the company to start paying off more debt in the years ahead. </p><p>\n  \"There's a lot of noise around the company and in the popular media, but those who really choose to focus on what we've done in the last year should come away saying, 'This a company that's really focused, they're executing and the future is much brighter than the past,' \" Mr. Desroches said. </p><p>\n  AT&amp;T also raised its full-year earnings guidance, calling for an adjusted earnings per share growth in the low- to mid-single digits. The company had previously projected unchanged per-share earnings compared with 2020. It also boosted its full-year free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to about $27 billion. </p><p>\n  Those projections didn't account for the pending sale of the DirecTV stake, however. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Discounts Bolster </p><p>\n  Wireless Base </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  AT&amp;T Inc. has boosted its wireless subscriber count over the past year by dangling significant smartphone discounts in exchange for long-term commitments, prompting rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. to respond with their own promotions. </p><p>\n  \"We still have a third-place share position in the market,\" said Jeff McElfresh, chief of the company's telecom division. \"We're staying focused on what customers want, and as long as we're getting a positive response, we're going to stick with it.\" </p><p>\n  AT&amp;T became the third-largest U.S. wireless network operator after T-Mobile US took the No. 2 spot last year by acquiring Sprint Corp. Dish Network Corp. has made strides through a Justice Department-brokered deal to build a fourth national system. </p><p>\n  The discounts, while expensive, helped AT&amp;T post a net gain of 789,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the second quarter. Investors value postpaid plans because account holders tend to provide dependable profit. </p><p>\n  Verizon on Wednesday said it gained 275,000 postpaid phone customers during the most recent quarter. T-Mobile is set to report results next week. </p><p></p>",
