  "text": "<p>Vonage's entry into the public markets 15 years ago was a fiasco. Its exit will prove much more pleasant. </p> <p>On Monday, the telecom equipment titan Ericsson said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dff985d-df72-4c97-8de1-2e6a4758d081\">acquire</a> Vonage at an enterprise value of $6.2bn. The takeover price is more than five times where Vonage traded at the start of 2015.</p> <p>The company arrived just after the dotcom boom. It became known as the force behind VoIP — voice over internet protocol, moving hard-wired phone calls to the internet. But a messy listing and a money-burning business model that did not anticipate the iPhone cellular revolution nearly sent the company into bankruptcy. </p> <p>In 2006, it sold shares to the public, including some of its customers, at $17 per share. On the first day, its stock price fell by more than a tenth presaging its coming difficulties. In 2009, Vonage shares traded at under 50 cents. The hype over VoIP had faded as Vonage was<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8619bb64-ecee-11db-9520-000b5df10621\"> bleeding customers</a> and faced patent infringement lawsuits from the likes of Verizon.</p> <p>But a few years ago, Vonage pivoted away from consumers to businesses, offering them a way to modernise their communications for a digital world. The timing proved perfect given the explosion in general IT outsourcing. The pandemic was another boon, forcing companies to adapt to remote workforces. </p> <p>Vonage's legacy business, however, very much exists today. Like AOL's dying dial-up internet service, VoIP remains highly profitable. Even as revenue is falling each year by 15 per cent, its ebitda margin is a lofty 65 per cent. In 2021, essentially all the company's forecast ebitda of $200m will come from its consumer business.</p> <p>The enterprise business has reached break-even profitability while it is growing annually at about 20 per cent. Even assuming that Ericsson is ascribing no value to the consumer business, that implies that the 2021 revenue multiple paid on the enterprise unit is less than six times. Vonage's rival Zoom trades at 25 times revenue while RingCentral is at around 15. Sometimes it is worth staying on the line.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Ericsson/Vonage: telecom pioneer finds a successful second act ' FT.com 22 November.
