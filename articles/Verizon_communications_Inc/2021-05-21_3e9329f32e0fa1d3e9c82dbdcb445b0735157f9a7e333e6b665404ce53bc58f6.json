  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>At America's largest companies, chief executives under 50 are still a relative rarity. Lex did some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5079911-3b0e-4048-8eba-408cc9c0790d\">number crunching</a> this week and found that the average age of a newly appointed S&amp;P 500 CEO has jumped 10 years since 2005. Last year it was 54. The average age of incumbent chiefs is even higher at 57 years.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Companies tend to pick older CEOs because they are seen as battle-tested, while younger executives are still considered a risk. Financial businesses in particular favour long records of service. At 60, the average age of the sector's incumbent chief is higher than any other industry.&#xa0;</p> <p>Experience and connections go some way to explain the staying power of Jamie Dimon and James Gorman. The two are the longest-serving heads of any big US bank. Dimon, 65, took his role as head of JPMorgan Chase in late 2005. Gorman, 62, is in his 11th year at the helm of Morgan Stanley. The success of their strategies is another reason for their staying power.</p> <p>So it was big news on Wall Street this week when JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley each announced executive shake-ups. Neither Dimon nor Gorman plans to step down right away, The leadership reconfigurations have set off a race between a small group of lieutenants to succeed them. </p> <p>Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, who are both 51, are front-runners at JPMorgan. Another duo have been set up to duke it out for the top job at Morgan Stanley: Ted Pick, 52, and Andy Saperstein, 54.</p> <p>As Lex noted, the next generation of banking bosses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aae17d2f-4fbb-4805-bef0-2d9c5691d31d\">face plenty of challenges</a>: including a strengthening fintech industry and unstoppable private capital led by groups such as Blackstone.&#xa0;</p> <p>Big changes are also afoot in Hollywood. First, AT&amp;T said it was spinning off its media business and combining it with Discovery. Then it emerged Amazon is in talks to acquire MGM, the film studio behind the James Bond franchise, for about $9bn.</p> <p>The back-to-back developments underscore how both legacy media companies and Big Tech are looking for ways to compete with Disney and Netflix in a global streaming race. For AT&amp;T, the deal with Discovery essentially confirms shareholder fears that the company's $85bn merger with Time Warner three years ago made little sense. Still, Lex's view is that AT&amp;T shareholders are lucky the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b3757bb-45ad-4d3a-80b5-bc386f75c07f\">managed to break even</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Media dealmaking has led to a string of calamities. Verizon, for example, sold AOL and Yahoo for half the purchase value. But Jeff Bezos may have better luck. Acquiring MGM makes sense. The deal would give Amazon instant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56beb2f4-10b3-4255-b4d9-362ed30bd3ce\">access to a deep catalogue</a> of films and television shows and keep its Prime subscribers from defecting to rival services. It won't be cheap. Amazon would be paying the equivalent of 31 times last year's ebitda for MGM, according to data from S&amp;P Global. Still, as Lex noted, $9bn is pocket change for Amazon, which generated $31bn in free cash flow last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest US private equity bids for UK businesses also looked very affordable. Indeed, we think Blackstone should be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f49b4c5e-99e4-4aa4-ac98-8e4e9ca7f026\">paying more</a> for property developer St Modwen, and KKR ought to stump up a higher price for infrastructure group John Laing. </p> <p>It is not just that UK quoted multiples are low compared with the US. Both businesses have plenty of upside: St Modwen because it has been pushing into the hot warehouse sector; and John Laing because its index-linked contracts make it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d0d7c09-2cb0-424a-98a0-bc11caf480a3\">a handy hedge against inflation</a>.</p> <p>Heineken is taking a bigger risk with plans to buy Distell, which Lex values at about €2.3bn. The brewer is based in South Africa, from which global capital has been in progressive retreat for years. The Dutch multinational may, however, be responding to a change of mood, with President Cyril Ramaphosa bringing greater stability after the shocks of the Jacob Zuma years.</p> <p>South Africa has a growing young, middle-class population for Heineken to sell to. Cost savings would cover a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1e244d6-b16e-4eb4-a155-690524b65997\">30 per cent premium</a>.</p> <p>The deal action in Asia came from Gojek and Tokopedia, which are merging. Combining Gojek's ride-hailing and payments services with Tokopedia's ecommerce services <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48fe3566-f686-4a0e-9cb2-1ce287cad7ac\">plays to a trend</a>, said Lex. South-east Asians love superapps offering everything from groceries to personal finance. </p> <p>The new group — to be called GoTo — may list in Jakarta and New York later this year with a target worth of up to $40bn. That would be on a par with south-east Asia's biggest ride-hailing and food delivery group, Grab, which merged with a listed US special purpose acquisition company last month.</p> <p>Have a pleasant weekend.</p> <p><strong>Pan Kwan Yuk</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: Pan Kwan Yuk 2021 'Best of Lex: shake-ups on Wall Street and in Hollywood' FT.com 21 May.
