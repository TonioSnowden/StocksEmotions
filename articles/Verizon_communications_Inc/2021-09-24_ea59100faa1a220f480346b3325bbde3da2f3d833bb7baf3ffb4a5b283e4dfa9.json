  "title": "Jan. 6 Committee Issues Subpoenas to Four Former Trump Officials; Mark Meadows, Steve Bannon, Dan Scavino and Kashyap Patel subpoenaed by House committee investigating assault on U.S. Capitol",
  "text": "<p>The committee's letters that accompany the subpoenas focus primarily on Jan. 6 and the day before, seeking to hear from Mr. Meadows on the grounds that he could serve as a witness because \"it appears you were with or in the vicinity of President Trump on Jan. 6.\"</p><p>The panel also seeks to hear from Mr. Bannon because of a report in the new book \"Peril,\" by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, that he met with lawmakers at a hotel on Jan. 5 to persuade them to block the certification of the presidential election, and to hear from Mr. Scavino. The committee says reporting indicates that Mr. Scavino was with Mr. Trump as the president considered how to persuade Congress not to certify the election for President Biden.</p><p>The subpoenas request documents by Oct. 7 and ask each of the former Trump officials to sit for depositions on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15.</p><p>Messrs. Meadows, Bannon, Scavino and Patel couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Trump said, \"We will fight the subpoenas on executive privilege and other grounds, for the good of our country.\" He added, \"We wait to find out whether or not subpoenas will be sent out to antifa and BLM for the death and destruction they have caused in tearing apart our Democrat-run cities throughout America.\" Antifa is a loosely organized far-left group. BLM is shorthand for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>Mr. Trump was impeached by the House in January on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. One of the committee's chief questions is what Mr. Trump did in the hours between exhorting his supporters at a rally on the Ellipse to march on the Capitol and later telling them that while the election was stolen, they had to go home.</p><p>The committee has already received thousands of pages of documents in response to their initial requests for records from eight federal agencies and 15 social media companies, a spokesman for the committee has previously said.</p><p>Among the agency records requested were executive branch records related to planning for Jan. 6 and the rallies leading up to it. The committee has also requested records from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Late last month, the committee also asked 35 companies to preserve records which may be relevant to the committee's investigation. The requests went to companies including Verizon Wireless, Facebook, AT&amp;T, Parler and Rumble. Among other things, the panel sought records related to certain individuals who held accounts during the period from April 1, 2020, to Jan. 31, 2021. The list of individuals wasn't made public.</p><p>More than 600 people have been charged in the Capitol riot. Of those, at least 50 have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. Only six have had their cases adjudicated and been sentenced.</p><p>Sympathizers depict them as victims of state coercion rather than lawbreakers.</p><p>In subpoenaing the four former officials, lawmakers say they hope to have more cooperation than in previous investigations of Mr. Trump, when their efforts to obtain documents and witness testimony were entangled in years of litigation. A 2019 effort by the House Oversight Committee to obtain Mr. Trump's financial and tax records is tied up in the courts. It took two years for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee in a Democratic-led probe into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice; he appeared only after striking a deal that limited his testimony.</p><p>\"There will still be opportunities to try to draw things out,\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), a member of the Jan. 6 committee, told reporters Thursday at a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor. \"But we may have additional tools now that we didn't before, including a Justice Department that may be willing to pursue criminal contempt when people deliberately flout a compulsory process.\"</p><p>The select committee, which is led by Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss.) and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), was established by House lawmakers in June in a 222-190 vote. It is tasked with investigating the circumstances of the Jan. 6 riot and its causes, including activities of intelligence agencies, law-enforcement agencies, and the Armed Forces, as well as how online platforms may have factored into the attack. It is mandated to issue a final report, but faces no set deadline.</p><p>Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com</p><p>The Jan. 6 Riot</p><p>* Rally for Jan. 6 Capitol Rioters Smaller Than Expected (Sept. 18)</p><p>* Homeland Security Unit That Failed to Warn About Capitol Attack to Get New Boss (July 8)</p><p>* Racially Motivated Extremists, Militias Pose Most Lethal Domestic Threat, Report Finds (March 17)</p><p>* Capitol Riot Warnings Weren't Acted On as System Failed (Feb. 8)</p><p>* Riot at the U.S. Capitol (Jan. 6)</p><p>Jan. 6 Committee Issues Subpoenas to Four Former Trump Officials</p>",
