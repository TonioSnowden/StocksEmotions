(ARKK was down 14% for 2021 through Nov. 26.)</p><p>So if you are looking for former high-flyers that may rise from the ashes to soar again, the following list may be useful to begin your own research.</p><p>In order to come up with a broad list with well-known companies that might not yet be included in the S&amp;P 500 SPX or the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX, we began with the Russell-1000 Index, which includes the largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization.</p><p>Exactly 60 of them were down at least 50% from their 2021 highs, through Nov. 26:</p><p> Company                                    Decline from 2021 high  Closing price – Nov. 26, 2021  2021 high  Date of 2021 high  Price change – 2021 through Nov. 26  StoneCo Ltd.
