  "text": "<p>It started in the late 1990s when Ms. Friar was a young consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co. in London, and many of her colleagues wanted to attend Stanford University's business school in California. She followed suit, thinking she would return home to the U.K. in two years. But after getting her M.B.A. she took a job analyzing technology stocks for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>\"I am probably, frankly, better lucky than good,\" said Ms. Friar, 48. years old</p><p>Following more than a decade at Goldman and stints as a finance executive at Salesforce.com Inc. and Square Inc., the Northern Ireland native became boss of Nextdoor Inc. -- a neighborhood-focused social network where locals come to swap recommendations for babysitters and handymen.</p><p>The number of daily active users increased by 50% in 2020 as neighbors turned to Nextdoor in search of help with navigating school closures, securing vaccine appointments and dealing with the stresses of stay-at-home orders.</p><p>\"Local never mattered more,\" Ms. Friar said.</p><p>Harry Friar</p><p>former manager at Herdman's Mill</p><p>Ms. Friar grew up in the village of Sion Mills in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, the three-decade conflict between Catholics and Protestants that killed and injured thousands. She credits her father, Harry, the personnel manager at the local mill, with helping foster kinship among residents in the midst of that strife. Ms. Friar said she looks to her father's example as she tries to build closer neighborhood ties at Nextdoor. \"We all had to think as one rather than think of the two separate populations,\" Ms. Friar said. \"My dad was a huge part of that and continues to be.\"</p><p>Mary Meeker</p><p>general partner at Bond Capital</p><p>When Ms. Friar was at Square, where she served as chief financial officer, she helped persuade former Goldman executive David Viniar to join Square's board. When Square expanded into the lending business, Ms. Friar used Mr. Viniar as a sounding board. She also relied on Mr. Viniar's nerves and advice to get through Square's rocky 2015 initial public offering, which valued the company beneath the range its bankers sought. Ms. Friar said he told her that \"your only job is to execute and ultimately, the market will value you for your execution.\"</p><p>David Viniar</p><p>former chief financial officer, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>When Ms. Friar joined Goldman's research division, there was perhaps no bigger name in her field than Mary Meeker. A technology analyst at Morgan Stanley in the 1990s, Ms. Meeker had been dubbed \"Queen of the Net\" for prescient calls on stocks such as AOL and Dell Computer. Ms. Friar viewed her as a role model. \"This phrase 'You can't be what you can't see' is a really important one to me,\" Ms. Friar said. In 2019, Ms. Meeker, now a venture capitalist, invested in Nextdoor and joined its board of directors.</p><p>John Hope Bryant</p><p>founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Operation Hope Inc.</p><p>While at Square Ms. Friar was introduced to John Hope Bryant, who ran a nonprofit that aimed to raise the credit scores of people from underprivileged groups. The two became friends and stayed in touch when Ms. Friar left for Nextdoor. Last year Ms. Friar sought Mr. Bryant's advice about how Nextdoor could be more useful to minority communities. Mr. Bryant helped her realize the importance of having Nextdoor moderators that are as diverse as the neighborhoods they serve. \"John has been really good at always pulling me back from feeling impotent,\" Ms. Friar said.</p>",
