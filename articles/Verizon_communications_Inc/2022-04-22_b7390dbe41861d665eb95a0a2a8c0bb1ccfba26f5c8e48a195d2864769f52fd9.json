In the consumer business, it saw wireless retail phone net losses of 292,000, noting that gross additions declined 2% relative to a year earlier. Consumer wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.77%.</p><p>The company noted in its release that while \"churn was steady,\" its postpaid phone metrics were hurt by \"competitive dynamics within the industry.\"</p><p>Verizon called out 229,000 total broadband net additions, making for what it said was its best quarter in more than a decade on the metric. It had 194,000 fixed-wireless net additions.</p><p>The wireless giant now expects full-year reported wireless service revenue growth to fall at the lower end of its previously issued range of 9% to 10%. Additionally, the company anticipates that adjusted earnings per share will land at the lower end of $5.40 to $5.55, the range Verizon outlined in its prior earnings report.</p><p>Verizon's report follows one a morning earlier from AT&amp;T Inc. T, which said that it posted its best first quarter for postpaid phone net additions in more than a decade.
