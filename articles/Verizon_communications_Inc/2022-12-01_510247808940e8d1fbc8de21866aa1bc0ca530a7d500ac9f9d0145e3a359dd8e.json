  "text": "<p>\n  In the words of Mariah Carey, \"All I want for Christmas is . . . IOU!\" </p><p>\n  That is, \"I owe you an iPhone 14 Pro or 14 Pro Max, since they're pretty much sold out everywhere.\" Apple has a supply problem -- or at least a Pro-blem. </p><p>\n  In early November, Apple-supplier Foxconn instituted a weeklong Covid-19-related lockdown at the iPhone's biggest assembly facilities in Zhengzhou, China. Operating at a reduced capacity during the crucial period for orders, Apple warned that shipments of its high-end models would be slowed. A few weeks later, workers at the same facility -- known as \"iPhone City\" -- protested and clashed with police after hearing that payments and bonuses would be delayed. Foxconn later blamed the issue on a computer error and offered payments to workers to quell the unrest. </p><p>\n  Now Apple doesn't have enough Pro models to meet holiday demand. </p><p>\n  Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., and other professional Apple watchers say this is a rare miscalculation for a company known for precise supply-chain management. An Apple spokesman said the company had nothing to add beyond its Nov. 6 statement. </p><p>\n  As we head into December, Apple.com shows both the $999-and-up iPhone 14 Pro and $1,099-and-up 14 Pro Max back-ordered until after Christmas. </p><p>\n  So why not get one of the regular models -- the $799-and-up iPhone 14 or $899-and-up iPhone 14 Plus -- which are readily available? Possibly because a very wise WSJ tech columnist said \"Go Pro or go home\" in September. Most buyers said the same. The iPhone 14 Pro models currently represent between 85% to 90% of global overall iPhone 14 sales, according to Mr. Ives. </p><p>\n  But the supply-chain Grinch hasn't completely stolen your iPhone Christmas. If you're set on getting one of Apple's surgical-steel three-camera models before the holidays, you've got some options. You might not even have to pay extra. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Option 1: Look for a deep purple iPhone 14 Pro. </p><p>\n  In my searches, I noticed a peculiar phenomenon: The model with the earliest shipping time was generally the iPhone 14 Pro in the deep purple color. They might end up selling out as all the other color options fade away, but it's worth a shot. I like the purple ones, but either there's a glut or fewer shoppers want them. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Option 2: Check out other sellers' selections. </p><p>\n  On BestBuy.com, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max stocks seemed to fluctuate as I checked back (though certain deep purple models remained available). AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile were a little less promising -- though again I did spot some of those poor purples shipping sooner. </p><p>\n  Just as in the Great Tickle Me Elmo Shortage of 1996, independent iPhone 14 Pro sellers might be price gouging. Search eBay and you'll see brand new phones listed for hundreds more than Apple's fixed prices. On Swappa, a website where individuals can sell new or used phones, things were a little more sane: Prices for new and used phones appeared to be closer to the retail prices. </p><p>\n  Your first stop should be Back Market, a marketplace that sells refurbished iPhones and other electronic devices. Sellers indicate the condition of them and Back Market restricts sellers from asking more than list price. When searching around the site, I found a few good options, including a 14 Pro in \"fair\" condition for $940. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Option 3: Buy an older iPhone 13 Pro. </p><p>\n  Without a doubt the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are better phones than the lower-end iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The Pros have three rear cameras, a faster processor and the new \"dynamic island\" multitasking trick. But the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max aren't much better than last year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. They look almost identical, and in my camera testing, I could barely spot the difference in the photos they captured. </p><p>\n  Any iPhone 13 Pro owner will miss out on the dynamic island, along with car-crash detection and emergency satellite texting, however. </p><p>\n  While Apple no longer sells iPhone 13 Pro models, refurbished options on Back Market are listed for $100 to $300 less than the price of the iPhone 14 Pro, depending on the condition of the phones. In fact, Serge Verdoux, Back Market's chief commercial officer, told me sales of iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models have increased over the last two weeks. </p><p>\n  You can also find new and used iPhone 13 Pro models on Amazon and eBay. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Option 4: Wait it out. </p><p>\n  Nothing says \"I love you\" like a printout of an iPhone order page with \"Coming soon!\" written atop it. Another idea: Pick up a fancy iPhone 14 Pro case and put the IOU in there. </p><p>\n  Sure, some of you might be thinking, \"What about switching to an Android phone, like the new Google Pixel 7?\" Sure, the new Pixel has some great photo tricks and the in-screen fingerprint sensor is improved. But switching platforms isn't an enticing option for many people who are locked into Apple's walled garden with AirPods and Apple Watches. Besides, switching from iOS to Android can be more of a hassle than waiting a few weeks for a new phone. </p><p>\n  Again, like Mariah says: \"I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree -- I just want you, iPhone 14 Pro, for my own.\" Hope you like deep purple, Ms. Carey! </p><p></p>",
