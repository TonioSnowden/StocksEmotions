  "text": "<p>Read more: Twitter layoffs continue under Elon Musk; another delay for Twitter Blue</p><p>And: 9 Twitter alternatives, like Mastodon and Hive Social, in case the social network shuts down on Elon Musk's watch — or you just want to quit</p><p>King was one of the first boldface names that threatened to leave Twitter if Musk's plan to have verified users pay $20 a month (later reduced to $8) to keep their blue check mark came to pass.</p><p>Read more: What does Twitter verification really mean? And what may happen to it?</p><p>King tweeted in late October, \"$20 a month to keep my blue check? F— that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron.\" That post went viral, and led Musk to respond by tweeting, \"We need to pay the bills somehow. Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers.\"</p><p>Musk also threw out a lower price at the time: \"How about $8?\"</p><p>This is perhaps why Musk responded to King's most recent tweet about MyPillow with \"Oh hi lol.\"</p><p>Musk followed up by asking, \"Is My Pillow actually a great pillow? Now I'm curious.\"</p><p>It should be noted that MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has been permanently banned from Twitter — twice — for pushing misinformation by spreading baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. He is also facing a lawsuit from a voting-machine company he accused of altering vote counts.</p><p>Lindell told Business Insider in an interview posted the day before Thanksgiving that he is hoping Musk will reverse his Twitter ban — as the new Twitter CEO did for former President Donald Trump earlier this month — saying, \"I'd fly to him, do whatever it takes.\"</p><p>As for Twitter's advertising woes, more than a third of the site's top 100 marketers have not advertised on the social network in the past two weeks, according to a Washington Post analysis of marketing data published Thanksgiving week, including blue-chip brands like Jeep and Mars candy, Kellogg K, Verizon VZ, Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer SAM and pharmaceutical company Merck MRK.</p><p>Stephen King: Twitter's only advertiser will soon be MyPillow.
