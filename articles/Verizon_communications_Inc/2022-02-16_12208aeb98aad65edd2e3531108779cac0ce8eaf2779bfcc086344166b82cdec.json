  "text": "<p>Telecommunications stocks have been among the rare gainers this year. The global sector has risen 3%, against a 6% decline in the wider MSCI World Index. Rising rates mechanically improve the appeal of dividend-paying companies relative to those that promise growth, but there are specific factors at play too, particularly in Europe. Vodafone is up 24% on news of investor activism and potential deals.</p><p>One hope is that the company, which used to own 45% of Verizon Communications and still has direct operations in 21 countries, might be able to merge some of its European units with local peers. Such deals would follow the example of the tie-up between T-Mobile and Sprint, which reduced the number of U.S. mobile operators from four to three.</p><p>The cost synergies latent in so-called \"four-to-three\" mergers could be a game changer for Europe's entire telecommunications sector. For years, the region's network providers have been squeezed between the investments required to keep up with mushrooming data traffic and their inability to charge consumers more for better connectivity.</p><p>Just as in the U.S., though, such deals would be politically sensitive because of the possibility that operators would be freer to raise prices amid lower competition. A previous wave of merger hopes and share-price gains in 2014 and 2015 fizzled after antitrust regulators signaled staunch opposition.</p><p>A number of companies seem to think that this time is different. Last week, French telecommunications company Iliad gave the first official confirmation of a much-discussed potential deal between its Italian unit and that of Vodafone, which had rejected an 11.25 billion euro, equivalent to $12.72 billion, cash bid, Iliad noted. Also last week, Spanish business newspaper Expansion reported talks between the Spanish unit of French giant Orange and its local rival MasMovil -- a company previously linked to talks with Vodafone.</p><p>Antitrust regulation has become even more stringent since 2015, yet the first part of the pandemic also underlined the strategic importance of digital infrastructure. On a call with analysts this month, Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read said the Covid-19 lockdowns \"opened up a new stream of discussion\" with governments, including about improving the sector's low returns to attract investment.</p><p>The case for buying stocks such as Vodafone and Orange doesn't rely wholly on contentious consumer-facing mergers. A parallel effort to improve returns and valuations involves spinning off tower and fiber-broadband assets into separate companies that can be pitched to investors as high-value infrastructure.</p><p>However the deal game plays out, Vodafone now has Europe's largest activist fund manager, Cevian Capital, on its back. Although it hasn't publicly commented on its stake, Cevian typically calls for companies to slim down by selling noncore businesses. Vodafone's 81% stake in Vantage Towers, its partially spun-off cell tower business, which even after this year's market switcheroo trades at a far higher multiple than its owner, seems an obvious place to start.</p><p>One way or another, European telecommunications companies are starting to look less like a value trap and more like a genuine bargain.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
