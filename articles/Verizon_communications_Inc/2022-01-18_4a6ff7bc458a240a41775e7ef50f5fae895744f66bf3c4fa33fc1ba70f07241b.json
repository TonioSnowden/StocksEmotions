The two telecoms groups initially rejected a subsequent request from regulators to delay their rollout by another two weeks to January 19, but then&#xa0;agreed to do so.</p> <p>The planned 5G services use frequencies in the C-band radio spectrum, which can be close to those used by altimeters that measure an aircraft's height from the ground and feed information into navigation instruments and other onboard safety systems.</p> <p>5G services have been introduced in other countries without sparking the same concern among airlines. According to the FAA, the services planned in the US differ in several ways, including operating at frequencies closer to those used by aircraft equipment, and at higher power levels.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

International oil prices hit seven-year high&#xa0;</strong>Oil prices have breached $87 a barrel and hit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d0364cf-dde6-4c7c-a14a-461f73894b19#post-b80da78e-71f2-4d6b-96ab-06ea381d55bc\">a more than seven-year high</a>, threatening to propel global inflation higher. The price for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was up 1.3 per cent to $87.63 a barrel, the highest since October 2014. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, which has risen more than 13 per cent since the start of year, reached a high of $85.74 in Asian trading. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Related news:</strong> US stock markets are set <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb684de4-fa00-4791-a062-fdcd737a08d2\">to open lower</a> after yesterday's public holiday as investors worry about interest rate rises and inflation. The yield on the two-year US government bond rose to its highest level since February 2020.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Bank of Japan revises inflation projection </strong>The BoJ has shifted its view on inflation risk <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/716d4d9e-da87-4ecd-9414-969bdb36406e\">for the first time since 2014</a>, driving the yen lower as a nation that has battled deflation for decades faces the mounting pressure of price rises in food and energy. The central bank revised its inflation projection upward from 0.9 per cent to 1.1 per cent for the fiscal year starting in April.</p> <p><strong>3. BlackRock's Fink rejects accusations of being ‘woke'</strong> Investors that focus on the interests of wider society rather than pure profits are not <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ab11b21-9a5c-480a-acd5-097ea0bb1ff3\">“woke”</a>, BlackRock chief executive&#xa0;Larry Fink&#xa0;has said after stinging attacks from US conservatives. The head of the world's largest asset manager used his annual letter to chief executives to fight back against accusations that BlackRock was using its influence to push a progressive agenda.</p> <p><strong>4. Russia's sanction-proofing weakens western threats </strong>Moscow's effort to reduce its reliance on the global&#xa0;financial system, which investors have dubbed the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2eaba73-cec8-4a0f-b991-7de558bb0ee1\">Fortress Russia</a>” strategy, could make western threats of sanctions a less effective deterrent from an attack on Ukraine. The EU's appetite for Russian gas has also made any restrictions on energy exports potentially self-destructive.</p> <p><strong>5. Texas synagogue hostage-taker was British citizen</strong> Malik Faisal Akram, 44, from the northern English city of Blackburn was identified by the FBI as the armed man <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3cae9a6-8317-4b54-b34a-5893605a54a5\">who took four people hostage</a> at a Texas synagogue on Saturday.
