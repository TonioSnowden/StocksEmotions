  "text": "<p>Who put the idea in the head of Beeple (also known as Mike Winkelmann) to auction off a so-called nonfungible token? This is unreported and it's no insult to suspect a stunt. Mr. Sundaresan claims to be sitting on a pile of ethereum wealth -- a cryptocurrency spawned in 2015 that once could be had for $1 and now sells for about $1,700. He wouldn't be the first aspiring mover and shaker who looked around for a splashy purchase to make without undue concern for intrinsic value. Upon placing his winning bid, Mr. Sundaresan drew out the drama by withholding his identity for several days, then issued a hot-buttony quote saying he sought to show \"Indians and people of color that they too can be patrons,\" as if this were a disputed proposition.</p><p>Beeple's art may or may not be in demand in 50 years, but nonfungible tokens are a plausible building block of the digital realities that humans might one day inhabit far more beguilingly than is possible today with a laptop screen or Oculus-style headset.</p><p>That world is coming. Unfortunately, a person can also be born, get old and die while inevitable futures are laboring to be born.</p><p>Which brings us to a related news item: Amazon has acquired rights to become the new producer of \"Thursday Night Football,\" the redheaded stepchild of NFL rights and still one of the most popular things on TV except for other NFL games. Nerds quickly scrolled down to a detail: The games will still be seen on local TV in the home markets of the two teams playing -- a concession to local fandom that is also a concession to streaming's limitations. Amazon is off the hook for delivering the game into those highly engaged neighborhoods with the heaviest concentration of viewers, where local third-party bandwidth might break down under the weight of thousands of simultaneous streams.</p><p>Some seem to forget: The internet is still a one-to-one architecture. A live football game isn't a Netflix show that can be stored in advance on local servers around the nation for customers who all watch on different schedules.</p><p>And that's just one complication in the glorious future of sports streaming. Interactivity is the holy grail for increasing \"fan engagement.\" Unfortunately, interactivity requires low latency while everything else about digitization tends to increase latency. On a streaming platform like YouTubeTV or CBS All-Access, the action is typically delayed 42 seconds or more. This puts the kibosh on microbetting -- betting on the next play or pitch, supposedly the next big money maker for the sports leagues.</p><p>It also makes a joke out of social-media interactivity. Over the 5G networks that Verizon and AT&amp;T are rolling out in stadiums, fans in the stands will be tweeting and live-streaming spoilers to viewers at home waiting interminably for the same events to show up on their TV screens.</p><p>The catch is a nasty one: Adding production value almost automatically means adding latency. Every effort to enrich the viewer experience, such as integrating multiple camera angles or access to odds and stats, is a technological lift that introduces more computational and transmission lag.</p><p>Of course telephony wouldn't have been born 150 years ago if real-time communication weren't possible. Video chat today would be intolerable without non-laggy communications. So it's technologically doable. But try it with millions of avid simultaneous participants who are geographically concentrated and relying on the same local infrastructure. Try it in super high-def with all the bells and whistles.</p><p>For these reasons, this column has been in less of a hurry than some to write off the cable bundle as far as live news and sports are concerned. Yes, the technological challenges can be solved. Lots of companies are trying. But like many visionary things, it can be easier to visualize the future than to get there. Ditto ownership of purely virtual properties in purely virtual worlds. The day is probably a lot further off than the $69 million price tag for a Beeple collage would suggest.</p>",
