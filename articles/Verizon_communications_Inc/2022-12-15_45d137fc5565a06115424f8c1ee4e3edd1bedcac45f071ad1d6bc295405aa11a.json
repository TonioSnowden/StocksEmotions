  "text": "<p>AT&amp;T shares had inched up about 2% over the course of 2022 as of the publication of Flannery's note, while shares of Verizon Communications Inc. VZ were down about 28% over the same span.</p><p>\"At current levels, the stock remains inexpensive on some valuation measures and could hold up well in a choppy market environment, but we expect 2023 to be another year of heavy investment, while strong KPI [key-performance-indicator] momentum could be more difficult to sustain as the wireless industry matures,\" he wrote.</p><p>The company, along with its peers, \"faces the prospect of slowing wireless industry adds in 2023 after several years of above trend industry growth,\" Flannery wrote. Add to the mix that there's new competition in the area, with cable players Comcast Corp. CMCSA and Charter Communications Inc. CHTR selling wireless plans to customers. Dish Network Corp. DISH just got into the game as well.</p><p>Don't miss: AT&amp;T has been 'a star' this year. Why this analyst says its stock can be one too.</p><p>Flannery also weighed in on AT&amp;T's dividend yield, which recently stood at about 5.9%. That yield is about 110 basis points inside of Verizon's, he noted, \"reversing a longstanding yield premium for AT&amp;T versus its closest peer.\"</p><p>Additionally, AT&amp;T's yield is at a roughly 230-basis-point premium to the 10-year Treasury, which, he wrote, is \"at the lower end of historical trends.\"</p><p>Flannery noted that AT&amp;T \"has not given any indication that it plans to grow the dividend from here after reducing the payout earlier in the year in conjunction with the WarnerMedia transaction.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, he's feeling better about shares of Verizon, turning bullish on the name Thursday.</p><p>See more: Verizon stock gets an upgrade amid 'overly negative' sentiment and a strong dividend</p><p>AT&amp;T shares are off about 2% in midday trading.</p><p>AT&amp;T has seen 'sustained outperformance' this year.
