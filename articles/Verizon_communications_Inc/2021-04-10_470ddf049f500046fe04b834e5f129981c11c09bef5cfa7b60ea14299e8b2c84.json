  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tami Erwin, the highest ranked woman at Verizon Communications Inc., keeps a lightbulb signed by a key mentor so she never forgets that colleague's counsel. </p><p>\n  Verizon executive Lowell McAdam gave her the bulb in 2006 after he noticed a dark sign outside a store in her region. \"She needed to see how the details could make a difference,\" explains Mr. McAdam, who went on to become chairman and chief executive of the company. </p><p>\n  \"I look at that lightbulb almost every day,\" says Ms. Erwin, CEO of Verizon Business Group, a unit with $31 billion of revenue in 2020. \"I am reminded to seek problems and solve them.\" Her division provides wireless and landline phone services, internet connectivity, security and other technology to businesses. </p><p>\n  Ms. Erwin took charge of the global unit in 2019 -- more than three decades after she joined the telecom industry as a customer-service representative making $20,000 a year. </p><p>\n  The 56-year-old reached upper management after taming her fiercely competitive style, moving her family four times and learning to cope with disappointments on the job. </p><p>\n  Here's what Ms. Erwin had to say about Mr. McAdam and three other valued advisers. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Jacqueline Cabe </p><p>\n  Chief financial officer of UW Medicine </p><p>\n  Ms. Cabe and Ms. Erwin have been close since childhood. Ms. Cabe always encouraged her to do the right thing -- and gave her confidence to persist despite difficult work situations. One such circumstance arose in 1997, when Ms. Erwin received negative feedback from her boss. \"People view you as very competitive. They don't view you as a team player,\" the supervisor said. Ms. Erwin sought solace from her best friend. \"Put the mirror to your face,\" Ms. Cabe replied. \"You know you are competitive.\" Ms. Erwin vowed to no longer be viewed as advocating \"my way or the highway.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Lowell McAdam </p><p>\n  Former chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications Inc. </p><p>\n  Ms. Erwin met Mr. McAdam in 1999, and he became an influential mentor. \"He was an incredible role model,\" she remembers. \"He used to sweat the details\" -- as evidenced by his frequent, unannounced store visits. His hands-on approach made her realize that she could lead better. While Verizon Wireless CEO in 2008, Mr. McAdam guided Ms. Erwin as she began to command its poorest-performing operation, which spanned 12 states. Ms. Erwin says she changed nearly the entire top team and \"set a different culture.\" Eighteen months later, her operation was the best performer. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Rose Fass </p><p>\n  CEO and co-founder of FassForward Inc. </p><p>\n  The leadership-development consultant provided valuable counsel in 2013 when Verizon wanted Ms. Erwin to leave its wireless business and take a spot at its slower-growing wireline arm. Ms. Fass insisted she could benefit from the new assignment. But first, Ms. Fass said, \"you should know what your value is outside of Verizon.\" Ms. Erwin fielded attractive offers for high-level jobs. Ultimately, however, she stayed put. The reason? \"Verizon no longer took me for granted.\" Her boss agreed to help her pursue a position that reported to its CEO. Her current assignment does. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Laurel Rossi </p><p>\n  Chief partnerships officer at Organic, part of Omnicom Group Inc. </p><p>\n  The veteran marketer advised Ms. Erwin as a business client before coaching her personally about becoming chief marketing officer of Verizon Wireless. \"I was ill-qualified to do that job,\" Ms. Erwin says. She appreciated learning \"through the eyes of someone who was an expert.\" Ms. Rossi also recommended that she use her powerful platform to spur the advancement of women. Ms. Erwin launched Women of Wireless, an employee-development program involving thousands of female staffers. Many have since landed leadership roles. </p><p></p>",
