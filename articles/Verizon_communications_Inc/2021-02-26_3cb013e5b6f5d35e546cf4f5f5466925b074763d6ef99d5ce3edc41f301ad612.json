  "text": "<p>Deutsche Telekom has reported the highest ever annual revenue for a European telecoms company after its takeover of US rival Sprint helped it push past the €100bn mark for the first time.</p> <p>Tim Höttges, chief executive, said that “growth on both sides of the Atlantic” would allow Europe's largest telecoms group to increase its investment in German fibre build while delivering on its plan to “attack the AT&amp;T and Verizon duopoly” in the US. It intends to invest more than €18bn across its operations in 2021. </p> <p>Annual revenue rose more than 25 per cent to €101bn in 2020, boosted by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80b3088c-5424-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\">takeover of Sprint</a> by its T-Mobile US business and strong customer growth in both German broadband and US wireless. Pre-tax profit for the year increased from €7.2bn to €8.6bn. </p> <p>Deutsche Telekom was on the verge of exiting the US market in 2011 when it agreed to sell T-Mobile US to AT&amp;T but the deal was abandoned due to regulatory opposition. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9906c8f8-06ed-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca\">subsequent revival</a> of T-Mobile US has turned the business into a core pillar of the German group and the US unit, in which it holds a 44 per cent stake, now accounts for more than 60 per cent of its parent company's revenue. </p> <p>Deutsche Telekom has 242m users largely as a result of the growth of T-Mobile in the US. “We are fully in the Champions League now,” said Höttges who sits on the supervisory board of football club Bayern Munich.</p> <p>The US recovery has come at a cost, with net debt at the German company rising by €44bn to €120bn at the end of 2020. </p> <p>Höttges said the company had “no intention of slowing down” despite that burden. It intends to raise its investment in its 5G and fibre networks in its two core markets of Germany and the US, buoyed by rising free cash flow which is expected to reach €8bn this year, from €6.3bn in 2020. </p> <p>The German company, which has built a network stretching from the Netherlands to eastern Europe and taken stakes in operators in the UK and Greece, has long been regarded as a potential consolidator in the European telecoms market. Its focus has increasingly been on Germany and the US and in the past few months it has sold its business in Romania to Orange and its Dutch towers to Cellnex, a move that could precede a disposal of its T-Mobile Netherlands operation to private equity. </p> <p>Höttges said European telecoms companies remain in a “catch-22” situation of needing to reduce costs due to revenue pressure while also investing heavily in new networks. “What we need is European market consolidation,” he said. </p> <p>He highlighted Poland, where Deutsche Telekom is a mobile-only player, and said discussions with potential partners over the next two months could “bear fruit”. Liberty Global, which owns the Polish cable operator UPC, said last week that it expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3893643-15ef-48b6-b3b1-3082b23d1a16\">strike a deal</a> for its Polish asset by the end of the year. </p> <p>Ulrich Rathe, an analyst with Jefferies, said the company had settled concerns that a sharp rise in capital expenditure in Germany could endanger its free cash flow forecasts.</p> <p>The confirmation this week of the results of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae9f3b6f-8d7b-4b69-83cb-97f60965ef8e\">C-band 5G spectrum auction</a> in the US has also reduced uncertainty for investors. T-Mobile US paid $9.3bn to bolster its already strong mid-band spectrum holding while Verizon paid $45.5bn and AT&amp;T shelled out $23bn, putting further pressure on their balance sheets.</p><p>Source: Nic Fildes in London 2021 'Deutsche Telekom revenue tops €100bn for first time ' FT.com 26 February.
