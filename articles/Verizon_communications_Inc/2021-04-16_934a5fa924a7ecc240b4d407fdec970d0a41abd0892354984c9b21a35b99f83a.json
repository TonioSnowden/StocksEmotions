  "text": "<p>Cable operators such as Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. joined the wireless sector in recent years with one goal in mind, executives and analysts say: Give their customers another reason not to leave, especially because pay-TV service businesses have been quickly losing subscribers as consumers turn to streaming services and internet-based TV bundles for entertainment. Now, the companies are looking to generate profits from their mobile businesses.</p><p>\"I think we're real, right?\" Comcast finance chief Mike Cavanagh said of the company's Xfinity Mobile unit during a recent conference, adding that the business would be profitable this year. \"I think there's no one that doubts that anymore.\"</p><p>Comcast on Thursday introduced a new slate of mobile plans in a push to undercut traditional wireless companies. Those companies remain dominant, with nearly 50 times as many mobile-phone subscribers as their cable counterparts at the end of 2020.</p><p>The rise of cable companies isn't yet a direct threat to wireless carriers, which get paid to provide access to their infrastructure. Comcast and Charter rely on Verizon Communications Inc.'s network, while Altice USA Inc. has a deal with T-Mobile US Inc.</p><p>Brooklyn resident Uchendu Nwachuku said he switched from AT&amp;T to Charter's Spectrum Mobile about two years ago and now pays $45 a month for unlimited data, compared with $120 previously for two lines with AT&amp;T. He said the price difference was \"the big motivator\" behind his decision.</p><p>Cable executives say they can keep their costs in check because mobile-phone users increasingly rely on Wi-Fi -- a medium that cable companies control -- rather than on cellular networks. Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge recently said 80% of all U.S. mobile traffic was on Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, data collected by market researcher Opensignal show that the average U.S. mobile user was connected to a Wi-Fi network about 60% of the time.</p><p>Where Wi-Fi isn't available, cable companies rely on the big cellphone-network operators to connect their users on the move. \"They are an important enterprise customer for us,\" Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said of cable operators in December. \"If they take share, ultimately we take share.\"</p><p>Cable's push into the wireless business didn't happen overnight. Companies have been looking for a way into the industry for nearly two decades and have made various attempts that failed to gain traction.</p><p>Some users of all three cable operators interviewed by The Wall Street Journal say they experience little-to-no difference in the quality of service, especially during the pandemic when they left the house infrequently and mostly relied on home broadband.</p><p>Cory Simpson of Houston, who uses Comcast's Xfinity Mobile, said that pre-pandemic, he remembered having some patchy service while at concerts or sporting events but acknowledged that is a common issue even for traditional wireless providers.</p><p>Cable companies tend to offer the greatest savings to customers paying for one or two phone lines. The price gap between cable and phone companies usually starts to disappear around unlimited-data family plans with three or more lines. Comcast said Thursday it will now offer multiline discounts, such as four-line plans for $120 a month.</p><p>Cable companies' mobile-subscriber base has nearly quadrupled over the past two years, while the top wireless carriers gained less than 2% over the same period, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson LLC.</p><p>With a combined 5.4 million mobile customers at the end of last year, Comcast, Charter and Altice USA remain very small compared with Verizon, AT&amp;T Inc. and T-Mobile, which directly serve more than 260 million subscribers. Mobile service accounts for a very small portion of cable operators' top line -- between 1% and 3% of their revenue last year, according to public filings.</p>",
