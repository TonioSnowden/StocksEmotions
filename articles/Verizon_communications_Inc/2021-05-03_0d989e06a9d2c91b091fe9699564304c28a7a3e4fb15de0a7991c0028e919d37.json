Help us improve FirstFT by taking our short </em><a href=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_0MJCBsPr4qs7ZpY\"><em>survey</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>The question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has captivated Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for more than a decade.</p> <p>But this weekend investors received the biggest hint yet of who that successor might be. </p> <p>The $631bn conglomerate reported first-quarter earnings on Saturday and held its annual meeting, which was virtual for the second year in a row because of Covid-19. </p> <p>Buffett and his 97-year-old deputy Charlie Munger were joined on stage by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain. The pair were given <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59a61aea-f60c-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00\">vice-chair roles&#xa0;in 2018</a> and are the top two lieutenants seen as the most likely successors to Buffett, who turns 91 in August.</p> <p>While Munger and Buffett&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06220c54-43c6-4e77-8952-a65245011a99\">were sparring</a>&#xa0;over whether Berkshire could ever be too large to manage, the deputy chair let a comment slip that got observers' tongues wagging about the succession, which is top secret.</p> <p>“Greg will keep the culture,” Munger said in a back and forth with Buffett, who he has served as deputy with for more than six decades.</p> <p>Buffett's succession plan has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/490949ae-964e-4291-b58f-d5d4126cf371\">drawn fire</a>&#xa0;from some big shareholders. A plan has been drawn up by the board but the heir apparent has been kept from the public. Shareholder BlackRock has said that Buffett's outsized leadership role at Berkshire presents a risk.</p> <p>For Cathy Seifert, an analyst who covers Berkshire for CFRA Research and watched the three-and-a-half hours of questioning on Saturday, Munger's aside settled the question of who will succeed Buffett when he steps down. “From Berkshire's perspective the succession issue has been resolved and to paraphrase . . . they've&#xa0;got Greg.”</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The world's <strong>largest economies</strong> stand a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dce3f4be-2da7-4cf8-a990-a867a9c2eb86\">chance of recovering</a> ground lost to Covid-19 by the end of 2021, much faster than economists had feared.
