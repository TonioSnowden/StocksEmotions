  "text": "<p>That influence comes as companies continue to increase the amount of capital they're collectively investing into startups. In the first half of 2021, businesses committed $79 billion in venture deals, surpassing the full-year record set last year of $74 billion, according to the SVB report.</p><p>CVCs' board influence could likely increase. The report estimates that companies will participate in a record 26% of all U.S. venture deals by the end of the year. Last year, companies participated in 25% of deals.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Rewards for renters. Watson Living Inc. is joining a bevy of startups that are helping landlords give people rewards for essentially being good tenants. The startup's founders see Watson—which recently raised a $2.5 million seed round led by Ulu Ventures, with participation by Trail Mix Ventures, FJ Labs and Gaingels—as part of a wave of integrating financial technology into real estate and other industries, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.</p><p>The company has built a digital banking app with an associated debit card that landlords fund each time a renter pays rent on time, signs a renewal lease early, or refers others to rent in the same building.</p><p>Other startups in this sector include Bilt Technologies Inc., launched in June, which offers credit-card points for rent payments. Piñata Global Inc., meanwhile, launched a rent-rewards app last year and raised more than $5 million since last year from investors including Moderne Ventures, according to Lily Liu, the startup's co-founder and chief executive.</p><p>These startups are gaining traction partly because the rental market is large and rents are rising, stressing tenants.

The SEC's Asset Management Advisory Committee unanimously approved a report recommending that the regulator increase ordinary investors' access to private-equity, private-debt and real-estate vehicles. The report, prepared by a subcommittee on private investments, said investors could benefit from the performance of these funds, which it said has generally been in line with or better than comparable public-markets offerings. However, the report also said regulators should balance greater access with investor protections.</p><p>Education-Technology Startup Multiverse Raises $130 Million</p><p>Multiverse, an educational technology firm founded by the oldest son of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, has raised $130 million in a push to build an alternative entry to well-paying jobs through professional apprenticeships, focusing on \"durable skills\" and diversity, equity and inclusion.
