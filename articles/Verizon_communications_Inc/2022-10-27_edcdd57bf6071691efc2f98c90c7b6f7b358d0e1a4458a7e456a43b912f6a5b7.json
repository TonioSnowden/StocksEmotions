  "text": "<p>T-Mobile said total net customer additions under postpaid plans would hit 6.2 million to 6.4 million for the year, up from its earlier 6 million to 6.3 million target. The positive projections represented T-Mobile's third target increase this year.</p><p>AT&amp;T added 708,000 such customers and raised its projected full-year profit, a sign its customers were still willing to spend heavily on new smartphones with expensive data plans. Verizon, the largest of the three U.S. wireless network operators, posted an 8,000-phone increase in the category.</p><p>T-Mobile's customer gains have led the wireless industry for most of the past two years despite disruption from its Sprint takeover. The merger helped the combined company cut its construction and tower-leasing costs and led to widespread layoffs over the past two years.</p><p>T-Mobile now expects savings and benefits from its 2020 purchase of Sprint to reach between $5.7 billion and $5.8 billion this year, up from its earlier $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion target.</p><p>T-Mobile's overall profit fell to $508 million, or 40 cents a share, from $691 million a year earlier, or 55 cents. The earnings result included $972 million of merger-related costs and an expected $803 million loss from the sale of the company's wireline network to Cogent Communications for $1.</p><p>Total revenue slipped 0.7% to $19.48 billion despite higher revenue from wireless service.</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>T-Mobile's Outlook Improves After Customer Gains Top Rivals</p>",
