  "text": "<p>Relatively clear weather and changes following a temporary concession by wireless carriers to address air-safety concerns helped blunt the disruption Wednesday, the first day of the 5G rollout.</p><p>\"While we anticipate minor disruptions at some airports due to the remaining 5G restrictions, we're pleased the Biden administration reached a compromise with AT&amp;T and Verizon to avoid mass cancellations across the aviation industry,\" United Airlines Holdings Inc. said Wednesday.</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. agreed Tuesday to exclude two-mile zones around airport runways from their 5G launches, a last-minute concession to address aviation safety concerns following a monthslong standoff.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it had issued new approvals allowing additional aircraft types to land at more airports in low visibility conditions. The FAA said an estimated 62% of the U.S. commercial fleet would be allowed to make low-visibility landings at airports where 5G C-band has been deployed, including Boeing 777 jets, which had previously been left out.</p><p>Airlines for America, a trade group, said the agreements allowed thousands of flights that could have been affected to proceed.</p><p>Airlines have said that passenger and cargo flights could face widespread disruptions in poor weather, when landing aircraft rely more on automated systems that could be affected by the enhanced 5G services. While airline and aviation safety officials have said the wireless carriers' decision likely averts the worst potential disruptions, they still anticipate some problems, particularly in bad weather conditions. Delta Air Lines Inc. said Tuesday it was preparing for possible cancellations.</p><p>Around 230 flights within and to and from the U.S. had been canceled by midday Wednesday, according to data tracker FlightAware, in line with recent days. These included a handful of flights involving Boeing Co. 777 jets, such as British Airways' service into Chicago O'Hare International Airport from London Heathrow.</p><p>Airlines had been waiting for regulators to approve the 777 to land in poor visibility, mirroring the green light given over the weekend to some other Boeing and Airbus SE jets. Early Wednesday, Japan Airlines Co. and All Nippon Airways, two of the carriers that had canceled some U.S. flights, said they could resume on Thursday.</p><p>FAA officials worked late into the night and early Wednesday morning to adjust guidance for runways and different aircraft types, industry and government officials said.</p><p>---</p><p>Drew FitzGerald and Doug Cameron contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
