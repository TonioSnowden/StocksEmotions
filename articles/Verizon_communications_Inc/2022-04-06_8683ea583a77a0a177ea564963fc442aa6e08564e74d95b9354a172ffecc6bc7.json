  "text": "<p>   New hires are facing the ultimate team icebreaker: Who pays your cellphone bill? </p><p>   Millions of workers have quit old jobs for new ones in the past year, and caller ID is outing young professionals -- and some not-so-young professionals -- for being on their parents' family plans. </p><p>   When Nicole McCauley, 35 years old, started her new job, executives at the firm initially screened her calls. Ms. McCauley, who changed her last name after she got married, said her managers didn't recognize the name Roger Batchelor -- which was what showed up when she rang. Mr. Batchelor is her father. The first time it happened, she made a joke. The second time felt worse. </p><p>   \"This is getting slightly embarrassing,\" she recalled thinking. </p><p>   Ms. McCauley's parents had to go to the Verizon store to change the caller ID for her line, she said. Then she practiced calling her 95-year-old grandmother to make sure her managers would see her name when she phoned. </p><p>   Now she wonders whether it's time to make a new family mobile plan with her husband. He is on his parents' plan, too. </p><p>   During the first part of the pandemic, moving business calls to personal devices was no big deal. Workers already had colleagues' mobile numbers saved in their contacts. But as Americans looked for new positions, cold-calls with recruiters, new bosses and business contacts opened up awkward conversations about who is footing the bill and when it is time to cut the cord on the family cellphone plan. Some carriers set an account's billing name as the default caller ID name. </p><p>   Hybrid return-to-office plans have also meant that employees are calling desk lines equipped with caller ID from their mobile devices. Some cellphone users have caller ID on those devices, too, widening the potential for embarrassment. </p><p>   Dima Maddah, 34, who works in digital marketing, is using caller-ID mix-ups to her advantage by getting out of professional calls she doesn't want to take. She started a new job in the fall and believes her personal cellphone number -- and her father's name attached to it -- were added to a sales database soon after. </p><p>   Sparked by her new role, sales reps called and asked for her dad. Their mistake has been a good excuse to say \"wrong number\" and hang up, she said. The influx of calls was the first time she realized that using her personal cellphone revealed she was on her family's plan. \"I usually text people,\" she said. </p><p>   That realization came publicly for Derek Forbort, a 30-year-old hockey player for the Boston Bruins, when he was on the Boston sports radio show Zolak &amp; Bertrand. </p><p>   \"Is there a female on the line?\" host Scott Zolak asked when Mr. Forbort called in November. Another host, Marc Bertrand, asked who Mary was, referring to the name that popped up on caller ID. </p><p>   \"Um, no comment on that,\" Mr. Forbort said. After more pressing, he copped to being on the family plan -- Mary is his mom -- but said he pays his portion of the bill. After he hung up, the hosts razzed him, wondering if Mr. Forbort, who makes $3 million a year, still got gas money from his folks. </p><p>   Mr. Forbort said later the radio show caught him off guard, and he didn't realize caller ID \"was still a thing.\" In his 20s, when he played in the minor leagues, Mr. Forbort said, he asked his mom to add international data when he traveled for games in Canada. </p><p>   So how long does he plan to stay on the parent party line? \"I'm going to ride it out as long as they let me,\" he said, adding that he is the keeper of the family's Netflix and Showtime accounts. \"I chalk it up to loyalty, being a very loyal son.\" </p><p>   It isn't that uncommon for 20- and 30-somethings to be on their parents' plans, and people are using the group deals to save money. Twelve percent of millennials, ages 25 to 40, have parents pay their phone bills, according to an October survey of more than 2,000 adults by MagnifyMoney, a personal-finance site. Others are on their parents' plans but finance at least part of the bill, according to a survey by WhistleOut, a website that compares wireless plans. </p><p>   It isn't just professional calls that lead to caller ID confusion. Donye Tweedie, 22, was at a Los Angeles restaurant in February when she met a man and gave him her number. When he called, a woman's name popped up on her cellphone's caller ID. Ms. Tweedie, who has paid her own phone bill since she turned 18, doesn't know whether the man was on a former girlfriend's plan or his mother's. She doesn't care. </p><p>   \"I wasn't interested anymore,\" she said. </p><p>    Stephen Miller, 36, a former adviser to former President Donald Trump, attempted to block a subpoena for his phone records from the committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot by arguing in a court filing last month that they should be off limits because he is on his parents' plan. Several family-plan members are attorneys who use their mobile devices for privileged calls and texts with clients that need to be protected, the court filing said. Mr. Miller didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Jeremy Coles, a 36-year-old professor who took a new job in Ohio and was caught on caller ID with a different name -- his dad's -- started sending Venmo payments to his father last year for his share of the family plan. </p><p>   Still, when he goes to buy a new phone, there is always an awkward moment, especially when the bearded professor has his own kids with him. Dr. Coles has to phone his father for the plan information. </p><p>   \"I don't look very young anymore,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
