  "text": "<p>   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Airports, city subways and transportation companies were split on allowing travelers to remove their masks for the first time in over a year Tuesday, following the abrupt end to the U.S.'s mask mandate on mass transport, including on board aircraft. </p><p>   On Monday, a federal judge in Florida declared the Biden administration's Covid-19 mask mandate for public transportation unlawful, throwing out its requirement that travelers in the U.S. wear masks on airplanes, trains, taxis, buses and other forms of mass transit. </p><p>   Soon after, a Biden administration official said the mandate is no longer in effect while the government considers its next steps. The Justice Department said Tuesday it would appeal the ruling by Tampa-based U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle -- if the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes in the coming weeks that a mask mandate remains necessary to protect public health. </p><p>   Following the judge's ruling, the Transportation Security Administration said it would stop enforcing mask mandates, as did major U.S. airlines on domestic flights. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. also said they would no longer require U.S. riders or drivers to wear masks. </p><p>   While several U.S. airports dropped the mandate, some didn't. </p><p>   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the area's airports, said Tuesday that mask rules would stay in place at New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports. Masks wouldn't be required at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, the agency said. </p><p>   In Philadelphia, a city health department mandate requires everyone to wear a face mask in public indoor settings, so mask mandates still apply on the city's airport campus and across all terminals. </p><p>   Elsewhere, local transit agencies were split on whether to keep or lose mask rules. </p><p>   New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the mask requirement on public transit remains in effect \"for now,\" under a March 2 determination by the state Department of Health. </p><p>   Others followed the federal government's lead. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said masks are no longer required on NJ Transit. </p><p>   At New York City's JFK Airport Tuesday morning, signs in the preboarding area of Terminal 4 reminded travelers to wear masks in accordance with federal law. An announcement played over the PA system reminding travelers to \"wear a face mask when required and follow the instructions of staff.\" A similar announcement played on the AirTrain, which connects all passenger terminals. </p><p>   On a Delta Air Lines flight from JFK to Orlando early Tuesday, there were no reminders to wear masks. </p><p>   Instead, during the predeparture announcements, the pilot, Capt. Kenny Buckley, said: \"Welcome on our first flight without the mask mandate,\" followed by whoops and cheers from some passengers. Most passengers on the flight didn't wear masks. On the Delta flight to Orlando, most flight attendants wore masks. </p><p>   In a note to employees Monday, Delta said employees and customers may continue wearing masks if they so choose. The airline also said it could take time for the news to reach airline and TSA employees and for airport signage to be updated. </p><p>    Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said the union has members on both sides of the mask debate. Some have young children or caregiving obligations and wanted mask requirements to continue, she said, but enforcing the rules has been a strain. </p><p>   \"Flight attendants are sick and tired of having to remind people to do something they agreed to do when they bought the ticket, when they checked in for the flight, and when they got to the airport,\" she said. </p><p>   About half of passengers in Orlando International Airport's main terminal were masked Tuesday. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, which operates the airport, said it would remove signs and messaging throughout the airport. Enhanced cleaning methods will remain in place, it said. </p><p>   For passengers, the first full day of travel without a mask mandate brought a mix of reactions, with some expressing concern and others joy. Because much of the airport signage and announcements still reminded passengers to wear masks, some passengers said they were confused or unaware the rules had changed. </p><p>   Max Lippy, 26 years old, traveled to Orlando from Hanover, Pa., with his wife and toddler. The family is spending the next eight days in Florida, with a visit to Disney, and is looking forward to the character meet-and-greets. Mr. Lippy, who is vaccinated, said he was glad to see the mandate removed. </p><p>   The CDC updated its website Monday after the court ruling, acknowledging that the mask requirement on public transportation and at transportation hubs \"is no longer in effect.\" The agency said, however, that it continues to recommend that people wear masks on planes and other public conveyances. </p><p>   \"We know that people are still traveling when they're positive,\" said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund, noting that asymptomatic people can spread the virus. </p><p>   While travel companies changed their mask rules on Tuesday, some other businesses and industries have been loosening mandates for several weeks. </p><p>   Employers including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Verizon Communications Inc., for example, told staffers that masks would be voluntary at many sites following guidance from public health authorities. </p><p>   There has also been an uptick in office reopening. Offices in 10 major U.S. cities were, on average, about 42.8% occupied in mid-April, near a pandemic-era peak, according to badge-swipe data from security company Kastle Systems. </p><p>   Changing attitudes about the pandemic were also seen in Johnson &amp; Johnson's Tuesday earnings report as the healthcare products company backed off its full-year sales forecast for its Covid-19 vaccine, citing a global surplus of doses and uncertainty over how the course of the pandemic will affect demand. </p><p>   Last week, the mandate was extended, but ultimately struck down on Monday by the Florida judge. </p><p>   Capt. Buckley, the pilot of the Delta flight from JFK to Orlando, said he was relieved the mandate was gone, especially for the sake of flight attendants who don't have to enforce it. \"It's one less contention on the aircraft,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Betsy McKay and Scott Calvert contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
