  "text": "<p>A big dose of fiscal support for the US economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2c18184-5cb9-4947-bde4-a80f3b9b1880\">will be withdrawn</a> this week as more than 7.5m people lose pandemic-era jobless benefits, testing the strength of the economic recovery amid a resurgence of Covid-19.</p> <p>The expiration of extra federal unemployment payments highlights a shift in America's policy response to the coronavirus crisis — away from emergency measures to support the labour market in favour of long-term changes to the safety net backed by US president Joe Biden.</p> <p>But the transition comes at an awkward time for the US economy and the Biden administration. There was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b66803b-59a4-4596-be91-ccb241043864\">a sharp decline</a> in the numbers of jobs created last month in America as the Delta variant of Covid-19 spread, with a big impact on the leisure and hospitality sector&#xa0;and construction.</p> <p>There is also confusion surrounding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a42d517-0fcd-42a8-bba0-03271c69f90f\">the reopening of schools in the US</a> after the summer break as the number of positive cases among children nears the January peak and staff shortages lead to disruption.</p> <p>The debate over the end of the jobless benefits comes as the impact of $1,400 direct payments in the form of stimulus cheques — another core element of Biden's stimulus — has faded.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Deutsche Telekom deepens bet on US market</strong> Germany's dominant telecoms operator has agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6476e1b6-7dcc-4b92-8470-f99a03229502\">a multipronged&#xa0;deal</a> with Japan's SoftBank that will see it increase its ownership of T-Mobile US as it seeks to compete with Verizon and AT&amp;T. </p> <p><strong>2. Jitters spread through China's property bond market</strong> Borrowing costs for some of China's leading real estate companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae2bbe36-1e49-4a46-bc65-955bbf962e2a\">are rising</a> in a sign that fears over debt problems at developer Evergrande are spreading more widely through the sector.</p> <p><strong>3. Berlin blames Moscow for cyber attacks </strong>Germany has accused Russia of launching a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16ac7609-32cd-467c-9a8d-8a796073df14\">spate of online attacks</a> on politicians amid suspicions that Moscow is interfering in this month's federal election to pick a successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>UK privacy overhaul </strong>Britain will launch a push <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d549f6b9-88fd-4b63-b58d-d9e737851a06\">to bolster online privacy</a> this week by seeking to persuade fellow G7 countries to limit internet tracking via “cookies”. Britain is recommending a less intrusive alternative system in which people set their privacy preferences a single time in their browser.</p> <p><strong>5. ‘Shang-Chi' smashes records in US cinemas </strong>Marvel's first superhero movie with an Asian lead character, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/731d8697-a894-4f81-aae6-0a27f3cf85ed\">generated $90m</a> in US ticket sales over the weekend, making it the most successful Labor Day release on record. The popularity of the movie was a milestone for Asian-American representation on the big screen.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>Biden</strong> administration's plans to widely administer coronavirus vaccine booster shots later this month has become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37fdfcbf-27cb-42cd-a037-bf3952969c8c\">mired in confusion</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Hong Kong</strong> is to allow visitors from the Chinese mainland to enter the territory without meeting its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96940d53-46ca-4887-bf3f-193563052947#post-53490d88-8f9f-4c35-8c37-566db8725ca9\">strict quarantine conditions</a>, chief executive Carrie Lam has announced.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>China's </strong>Sinopharm aims to develop its own <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cbc7ef-808d-448a-a832-2384f045dc35\">mRNA vaccine</a>, becoming one of the first Chinese pharmaceutical groups to use the technology to combat Covid-19.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96940d53-46ca-4887-bf3f-193563052947\"><em>our live coverage</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/newsletter-signup/coronavirus\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> to our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-business-update\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a><em> for a regular briefing on how the pandemic is affecting the economy.

The legislation is part of leader Xi Jinping's vision to build what some analysts call a “<a href=\"https://ft.com/content/9ef38be2-9b4d-49a4-a812-97ad6d70ea6f\">techno-authoritarian superpower</a>”. <em>This is the second in a series on Xi's assertion of greater control in China.

One could argue this use is a win-win. But much of the work is poor preparation for life outside, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/974a0520-bd9e-4069-bb2e-b28f8150c4d3\">writes Sarah O'Connor</a>.</p> <p><strong>Supply chain squeeze hits chairs and cupboards </strong>Manufacturers of everything from cupboards to cars are still grappling with a logistics crunch that has disrupted supplies of essential inputs, threatening the post-pandemic economic rebound. Combined with rising consumer demand, in Europe, these shortages have led to inflation reaching <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8e2b72f2-b937-4152-a61b-c18758160650\">a decade high</a>.</p> <p><strong>Fleeing Afghans revive US memories of Vietnam's ‘babylift' </strong>Images of Afghans fleeing Kabul airport have revived memories for many Americans of Operation Babylift, which airlifted 2,000 orphans out of Vietnam weeks before Saigon fell.
