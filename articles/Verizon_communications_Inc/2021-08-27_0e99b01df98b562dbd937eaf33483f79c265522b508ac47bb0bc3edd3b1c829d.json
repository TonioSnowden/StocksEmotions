  "title": "Cable TV Executive Spiced Up a Highbrow Channel; Nickolas Davatzes, who has died at age 79, diversified A&E from ballet and opera to biographies, history and crime shows",
  "text": "<p>Yet Mr. Davatzes succeeded in creating durable brands for what started out as a hodgepodge. Programs in the 1980s included a biography of Herbert Hoover, a dramatization of an Ann Beattie short story, a performance by the stand-up comic Buzz Belmondo and a salute to the 200th anniversary of Australia's birth.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes arranged for American commentary to precede or follow British shows so there would be an A&amp;E stamp on them. He also collaborated with overseas partners to produce new shows.</p><p>The network discovered that military topics drew more male viewers and that documentaries about history and famous people were popular. Those led to offshoots, including the History Channel, which originally offered black-and-white footage of World War II sea battles or early jazz musicians before branching into racier fare, such as a series on the history of sex.</p><p>Fine arts and Jane Austen remakes alone wouldn't have paid the bills. \"When A&amp;E aired operas, we used to joke that you could have gotten more viewers if you mailed out the cassettes,\" Brooke Bailey Johnson, a former A&amp;E general manager, told The Wall Street Journal in 2001.</p><p>Searching for younger viewers, the network embraced \"Law &amp; Order\" reruns, reality television and toned-down versions of \"The Sopranos,\" HBO's hit mob drama.</p><p>In November 2003, a History Channel program, \"The Guilty Men,\" alleged that Lyndon Baines Johnson was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Johnson family and others protested furiously. Several months later, the History Channel apologized to the Johnson family and agreed to air a follow-up program challenging the assertions made in the original show.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes sometimes bounced a basketball as he made the rounds of the head office. It was his way of breaking the ice for casual chats with his staff.</p><p>The company, now known as A+E Networks, is a joint venture of Hearst Communications Inc. and Walt Disney Co. A+E Networks says its programs reach more than 335 million households globally in 41 languages.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes, who retired in 2005, got his start in the early days of cable television and stayed in the field long enough to see it transformed by digital technology and the internet. \"It's like rolling the dice right now,\" he said about changes in the industry in 1998. \"I said to myself, 'I'm not sure where this ship is going, but I'm getting on it.' I don't want to be in a position of finding out they discovered America and I'm not there because I'm still in Greece tending my sheep.\"</p><p>That may have been an oblique reference to his father, George Davatzes, who was born in Greece, emigrated to the U.S. as a young man and was co-owner of a shop in Manhattan making fur coats. His mother, Alexandra Kordes Davatzes, also of Greek descent, helped out at the fur shop.</p><p>The older of two children, Nick Davatzes was born March 14, 1942. As a teenager, he learned to nail animal skins to coat patterns at his father's shop.</p><p>The family lived in New York's Chelsea district and later in Queens. In high school, Nick Davatzes liked the social sciences, especially history, and won a college-level art scholarship. \"My father suggested I turn it down, which was wise,\" he told the Times. \"I really wasn't good enough.\"</p><p>At St. John's University in Queens, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's in sociology. He volunteered to serve in the Marines and was stationed in the U.S. In 1968, he married Dorothea Hayes, a schoolteacher whom he had met at St. John's.</p><p>He found a job selling copiers for Xerox Corp. \"I had a great reason for going to Xerox,\" he said. \"I was tired of being poor.\" He later became an executive in Xerox's Learning Systems business, which offered training programs. After a brief spell at another company that provided information services and educational materials, he joined Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc., where he was a personnel executive and later managed cable operating companies.</p><p>When Warner tried to transfer him to Houston, Mr. Davatzes resisted. \"My wife and I had decided early on that we were not going to move our children around, no matter what that meant for my career,\" he said. Instead, he stayed in the New York area and joined A&amp;E—created from the merger of two struggling channels—as chief executive in December 1983 to prepare for its launch.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes died at his home in Wilton, Conn. He had been under treatment for Parkinson's disease. He is survived by his wife, Dorothea Hayes Davatzes, two sons, four grandchildren and a sister. Another son, Christopher, died of leukemia in 1974.</p><p>President George W. Bush presented Mr. Davatzes with the National Humanities Medal in 2006.</p><p>A colleague recalled that Mr. Davatzes was walking down the hall at A&amp;E in the early days and heard a phone ringing at an empty desk. He answered it. \"Always pick up the phone,\" he told his staff. \"That could be a customer.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
