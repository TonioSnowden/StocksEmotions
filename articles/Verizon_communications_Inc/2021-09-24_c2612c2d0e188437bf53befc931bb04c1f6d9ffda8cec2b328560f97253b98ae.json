  "title": "Jan. 6 Committee Issues Subpoenas to Four Former Trump Officials; Mark Meadows, Steve Bannon, Dan Scavino and Kashyap Patel subpoenaed by House committee investigating assault on U.S. Capitol",
  "text": "<p>The committee's letters that accompany the subpoenas focus primarily on Jan. 6 and the day before, seeking to hear from Mr. Meadows on the grounds that he could serve as a witness because \"it appears you were with or in the vicinity of President Trump on Jan. 6.\"</p><p>The panel also seeks to hear from Mr. Bannon because of a report in the new book \"Peril,\" by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, that he met with lawmakers at a hotel on Jan. 5 to persuade them to block the certification of the presidential election, and to hear from Mr. Scavino. The committee says reporting indicates that Mr. Scavino was with Mr. Trump as the president considered how to persuade Congress not to certify the election for President Biden.</p><p>The subpoenas request documents by Oct. 7 and ask each of the former Trump officials to sit for depositions on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15.</p><p>Messrs. Meadows, Bannon, Scavino and Patel couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump was impeached by the House in January on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. One of the committee's chief questions is what Mr. Trump did in the hours between exhorting his supporters at a rally on the Ellipse to march on the Capitol and later telling them that while the election was stolen, they had to go home.</p><p>The committee has already received thousands of pages of documents in response to their initial requests for records from eight federal agencies and 15 social media companies, a spokesman for the committee has previously said.</p><p>Among the agency records requested were executive branch records related to planning for Jan. 6 and the rallies leading up to it. The committee has also requested records from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Late last month, the committee also asked 35 companies to preserve records which may be relevant to the committee's investigation. The requests went to companies including Verizon Wireless, Facebook, AT&amp;T, Parler and Rumble. Among other things, the panel sought records related to certain individuals who held accounts during the period from April 1, 2020, to Jan. 31, 2021. The list of individuals wasn't made public.</p><p>Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com</p><p>The Jan. 6 Riot</p><p>* Rally for Jan. 6 Capitol Rioters Smaller Than Expected (Sept. 18)</p><p>* Homeland Security Unit That Failed to Warn About Capitol Attack to Get New Boss (July 8)</p><p>* Racially Motivated Extremists, Militias Pose Most Lethal Domestic Threat, Report Finds (March 17)</p><p>* Capitol Riot Warnings Weren't Acted On as System Failed (Feb. 8)</p><p>* Riot at the U.S. Capitol (Jan. 6)</p><p>Jan. 6 Committee Issues Subpoenas to Four Former Trump Officials</p>",
