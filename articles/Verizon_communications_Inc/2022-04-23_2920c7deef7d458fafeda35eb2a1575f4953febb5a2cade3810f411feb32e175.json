  "title": "Jan. 6 Committee Seeks to Force Mark Meadows Testimony; House committee claims former Trump chief of staff Meadows had been warned about potential violence on that day",
  "text": "<p>\"I know that there were concerns brought forward to Mr. Meadows. I don't know—I don't want to speculate whether or not they perceived them as genuine concerns, but I know that people had brought information forward to him that had indicated that there could be violence on the 6th. But, again, I'm not sure if he—what he did with that information internally,\" Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide in the Trump White House said in testimony provided to the committee, according to court documents the panel filed Friday.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Meadows didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Meadows sued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of the Jan. 6 committee in December, asking the federal court to block enforcement of subpoenas the committee issued to Mr. Meadows and to Verizon Wireless seeking his phone data. The lawsuit said the committee lacked legal authority and that its demands were overly broad and burdensome.</p><p>The Jan. 6 committee said it now has testimony from Trump staff that the White House counsel advised Mr. Meadows and some members of Congress that efforts to assemble alternate, pro-Trump slates of electors wouldn't be legal. The committee previously said it was looking into purported, pro-Trump Electoral-College certificates that were sent from individuals in seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p><p>Mr. Meadows said in his lawsuit that Mr. Trump told him not to comply with the demands from the Jan. 6 committee, citing executive privilege. But President Biden waived those privilege claims. As a result, Mr. Meadows' complaint said he \"has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims that are of constitutional origin and dimension.\"</p><p>The Democratic-controlled House voted in December to hold Mr. Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress after he defied a subpoena to sit for a deposition for the Jan. 6 investigation. The House's move sent the matter to the Justice Department to consider whether to prosecute Mr. Meadows, though the department hasn't said whether it will do so.</p><p>Mr. Meadows already handed over thousands of records, including text messages, to the Jan. 6 committee. He previously said he would testify to the panel, but later backed out, citing concerns about executive privilege.</p><p>Members of the Jan. 6 panel have said Mr. Meadows' claims of executive privilege don't apply because they want to ask him about documents he already turned over to the committee.</p><p>The panel also said in court documents Friday that Mr. Meadows acted in a nongovernmental capacity regarding postelection efforts the committee said were meant to help Mr. Trump's campaign rather than in his official White House role.</p><p>\"Mr. Meadows is hiding behind broad claims of executive privilege even though much of the information we're seeking couldn't possibly be covered by privilege and courts have rejected similar claims because the committee's interest in getting to the truth is so compelling,\" committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss.) and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said in a joint statement Friday.</p><p>The committee said Friday it would narrow its demands and would seek that Mr. Meadows provide testimony and documents about only certain topics, including efforts to create false slates of electors and communications with members of Congress related to the events of Jan. 6.</p><p>Lawmakers previously disclosed some text messages between Mr. Meadows and some allies during the Capitol attack, which revealed that they had implored Mr. Meadows to press Mr. Trump to intervene to stop the rioters.</p><p>Mr. Meadows criticized the disclosure of those messages. \"Mr. Meadows provided the Select Committee thousands of documents it could have reviewed and attempted to legislate on, but instead its members have waged a public campaign against Mr. Meadows, exposing his private documents for purposes of exploitation, self-aggrandizement, and political gain,\" his attorneys wrote in a court filing earlier this month.</p><p>Mr. Meadows isn't the only Trump official who has resisted the investigation by the Jan. 6 committee, which includes seven Democrats and two Republicans. The House earlier this month voted to hold in contempt of Congress two more Trump allies, Dan Scavino, the deputy chief of staff for communications in Mr. Trump's White House, and Peter Navarro, the former trade adviser, for failing to respond to the panel's subpoenas, sending the matter to the Justice Department.</p><p>Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump, has been charged with criminal contempt for defying a subpoena from the panel. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial in July.</p><p>Capitol Riot</p><p>See more related coverage, selected by the editors:</p><p>* Jan. 6 Capitol Riot Prosecutors Face New Headwinds (April 10, 2022)</p><p>* Judge Acquits Man of Charges Linked to Jan. 6 Capitol Riot by Trump Supporters (April 6, 2022)</p><p>* How Those Who Were There Look Back on Jan. 6 Capitol Riot (Jan. 6, 2022)</p><p>Write to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com</p><p>Jan. 6 Committee Seeks to Force Mark Meadows Testimony</p>",
