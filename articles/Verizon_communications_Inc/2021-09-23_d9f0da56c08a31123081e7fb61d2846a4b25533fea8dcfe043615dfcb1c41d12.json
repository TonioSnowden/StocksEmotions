  "text": "<p>The company expects the growth to continue the following year. It predicts revenue between $31.65 billion and $31.8 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2023.</p><p>\"Digital transformation was certainly under way before the pandemic began,\" said Salesforce Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver at the company's investor day on Thursday. \"But what the pandemic did is it compressed years, if not decades, into months as companies suddenly focused all of their energies on digital transformation.\"</p><p>The company's shares Thursday rose close to 7% on the news.</p><p>Salesforce has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, with companies embracing more cloud-based software tools to stay connected with their customers. Its shares are up about 84% since the virus started spreading around the world in March 2020.</p><p>Growth for companies selling cloud services has been gaining speed. When entire industries and governments were sent to remote work, they quickly bought up digital tools they needed to stay productive. The growth has continued even as organizations return to working from offices.</p><p>Last month, Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor said that the spread of the more-infectious Delta variant of Covid-19 had sped up adoption of cloud-based tools. \"Delta has shown this virus is not going away,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>Some are seeing a hangover following fast growth. Zoom Video Communications Inc. became a household name during the pandemic, with new business lifting its shares as much as 744% last year. But in its most recent quarterly earnings, the company's guidance disappointed as small businesses and consumers expected to spend less on Zoom.</p><p>Salesforce recently closed on its $27.7 billion purchase of chat-based business communication company Slack Technologies Inc., the software giant's biggest acquisition ever.</p><p>At its Dreamforce tech conference this week, the company emphasized product integrations with Slack in designing what it calls its \"digital headquarters\" to help organizations continue working remotely.</p><p>\"My digital headquarters is more important than my physical headquarters,\" Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff said at the conference.</p><p>The Dreamforce conference used to take over San Francisco every year, but now it has moved to mostly virtual starting last year during the pandemic. This year, the conference hosted 1,000 users at the in-person portion of the event at the outdoor Dreamforce International Park in the city.</p><p>Salesforce has been leveraging its success to acquire new business to fuel growth into new software markets. But the company said it is now focused on integrating its recently acquired companies, including Slack and its $15.7 billion acquisition of data-visualization business Tableau Software Inc. in 2019.</p><p>\"We're opportunistic so I'd never say never,\" said Ms. Weaver on Thursday. \"For right now, as I look to the near future, I do not see a real appetite for large strategic acquisitions.\"</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Salesforce Boosts Sales Outlook as Covid-19 Continues to Lift Demand</p>",
