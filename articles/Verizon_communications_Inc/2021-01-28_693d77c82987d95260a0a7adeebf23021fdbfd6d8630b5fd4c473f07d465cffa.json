  "title": "Arts in Review -- Art Review: The Met Phones It In --- The museum's digital show feels more like an ad for a telecom company than a virtual exhibition",
  "text": "<p>Unlike the multiplatform digital exhibitions that are increasingly common, this \"immersive virtual art and gaming experience with enhancements powered by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband\" can be visited only on your phone. A short tutorial guides you through the basics of this augmented-reality trip to 1000 Fifth Avenue and you start where most visitors do in real life: the museum's Beaux-Arts Great Hall. From there, by tapping different icons, you can examine Kent Monkman's two mammoth paintings, \"Welcoming the Newcomers\" and \"Resurgence of the People\" (both 2019), or move on to explore a quartet of virtual galleries -- \"Home,\" \"Journey,\" \"Nature\" and \"Power\" -- using a tap-to-move interface. In all, \"The Met Unframed\" contains 46 artworks, four of which offer those 5G \"enhancements.\"</p><p>On its face, the idea is bursting with people-pleasing potential: Curate a Best-Of menu of famous art, mix in some overlooked masterpieces, and serve them up online in a way that everyone -- New Yorker or not -- can get a taste of the Met.</p><p>Here, though, selections can seem confused and confusing. Van Gogh's well-worn \"Shoes\" (1888) are a cozy fit for the \"Home\" section, as is the astonishingly preserved cubiculum (or bedroom) buried by the Vesuvius eruption of A.D. 79. But one wonders what Mary Cassatt's painting of her older sister crocheting has to do with \"Power\" or how Carmen Herrera's geometric \"Iberic\" (1949) taps into \"Nature.\" The fine works of Jacob Lawrence fit the \"Journey\" category perfectly, but were five necessary in such a small show when so many of the Met's other holdings -- like those from sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and the Islamic world -- get little to no representation?</p><p>That said, curating a generalist exhibition is no easy task when drawing from a collection of two million objects and, credit where it's due, the entries for each are succinct and informative. Clicking on an individual work brings up the usual label details, a brief description and a link to the Met's site where visitors can learn more. Many pages also include audio-guides and shortcuts to the Met's illuminating Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.</p><p>The problem is, these features are the only worthwhile part of the experience, grafted onto a digital Frankenstein that is stitched together with an atrophied navigation system and vestigial activities that should have been excised early. The snail-paced reactions both while moving through spaces and panning around them give one the feeling of being trapped in a dream where time is slowed. Pair this with a repetitive background soundtrack and the limitations of the phone's size -- a five-inch screen is no way to appreciate artistic detail -- and the outcome is borderline maddening.</p><p>Worse still are the added features that deploy smartphone bells and whistles but neither make things feel more immersive nor add to users' appreciation of art. In the \"gaming experience,\" for one, each work is accompanied by a simple activity, like a sliding puzzle in which users unscramble the object. Though not fun or informative, completing the task unlocks another feature called \"AR-t,\" which allows you to use augmented reality to \"place\" the artwork on your wall and snap a photo. Seeing a grainy version of Winslow Homer's \"The Gulf Stream\" (1899) above my reading nook was entertaining for about five seconds, but hardly worth the hassle.</p><p>Finally, there's a catch to those \"enhanced\" works. Unless you're specifically a Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband customer, you won't be able to see them. But don't worry -- you aren't missing much. The river ripples as oarsmen paddle in Emanuel Leutze's \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" (1851). A waterfall flows over the edge of the painting's frame in Frederic Edwin Church's \"Heart of the Andes\" (1859). You get the idea. In effect, the Met has devolved these works into pure kitsch, toying with icons of its collection in a way it would never allow outside entities to do. Paradoxically, by making these masterpieces move, the website has made them feel less alive.</p><p>And by caging \"The Met Unframed\" experience within a mobile prison, and essentially including Verizon's name in the title, the museum appears to be allowing itself to be used as a way for a telecom company to drive its own business, not greater art appreciation. While corporate sponsorship remains an important aspect of museums' financial health, those art institutions must remain in the driver's seat where programming is concerned.</p><p>I don't want to discourage technological experiments that aim to expand who can see art and how we view it. The Met's own \"82nd &amp; Fifth\" multimedia project, which combines videos, slideshows, 3-D photography and more, and the Mauritshuis's ultra-hi-def gigapixel 3-D tour of its collection are great examples of institutions using technologies both established and cutting-edge to serve their patrons. But when an art exhibition starts to feel like an exercise in product placement, it's time to pull the plug.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Kelly is the Journal's associate Arts in Review editor.
