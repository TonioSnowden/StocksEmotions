  "text": "<p>A rising dividend yield isn't always a good sign, as it can signal more negative investor sentiment as the stock's price comes down. On the flip side, in AT&amp;T's case, the falling yield comes as Wall Street increasingly warms to the company's execution and prospects.</p><p>Read: AT&amp;T's 'far simpler story' and 'solid' dividend earn stock an upgrade</p><p>AT&amp;T's dividend yield was as high as 7.81% on Oct. 12, but the stock yielded 6.12% as of Wednesday as the stock rose 24% over that span. Verizon currently yields 7.14%.</p><p>See more: AT&amp;T stock has its best week since 2000 as analyst says 'there is at least a plausible case for optimism'</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery, who highlighted in a Wednesday note to clients that AT&amp;T's 17% outperformance last week brought its dividend yield \"inside VZ's for the first time in several years,\" wrote that AT&amp;T's latest earnings \"looked even cleaner\" in light of Verizon's more mixed results.</p><p>\"We view AT&amp;T's results as good enough for now as they should provide enough comfort for investors looking for a relatively defensive name into year-end, while shares should also have support from a dividend yield that remains &gt;6%,\" Flannery continued.</p><p>AT&amp;T's dividend—and its ability to support it—are of strong interest to investors, and the company sought to reassure investors about its positioning after recording $3.8 billion in free-cash flow from continuing operations during the third quarter.</p><p>\"We hope this healthy free-cash flow for the quarter gives you confidence in our ability to achieve our target for free-cash flow in the $14 billion range for the year, a level that is more than ample to support our $8 billion dividend commitment,\" Chief Executive John Stankey said on the company's earnings call.</p><p>Verizon's earnings call also contained mention of dividend commitments, as Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis noted that the company recently increased its dividend for the 16th consecutive year.</p><p>\"We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to continue to put the board in a position to approve annual increases,\" he said.</p><p>Tomi Kilgore contributed to this article.</p><p>AT&amp;T's dividend yield falls below Verizon's.
