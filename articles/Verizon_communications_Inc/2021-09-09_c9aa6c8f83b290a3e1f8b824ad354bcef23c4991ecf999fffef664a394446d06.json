  "title": "Big Business for Big Government; AT&T wants the FCC to hobble its 5G competitor, T-Mobile.",
  "text": "<p>As a primer, millimeter spectrum is useful in covering dense population areas, but it can't travel long distances and penetrate buildings very well. Low-band spectrum can better cover rural areas but is slower and has lower carriage capacity. Mid-band offers a balance of speed, capacity, coverage and penetration to blanket metro areas with 5G.</p><p>T-Mobile acquired loads of mid-band when it purchased Sprint last year. Contrary to progressive antitrust claims, the merger has accelerated 5G and pushed AT&amp;T and Verizon to invest more in their networks. Both are trying to catch up to T-Mobile by unwinding unsuccessful media acquisitions and buying more mid-band at government auctions.</p><p>But now AT&amp;T wants the FCC to hamstring T-Mobile. Its proposal would let the commission limit how much mid-band in the range of 2.5 GHz and 6 GHz that a provider could acquire in future auctions. Providers that buy more spectrum than the FCC's screen could be forced to divest it.</p><p>One irony is that AT&amp;T and Verizon earlier in the decade opposed a similar screen for low-band spectrum. They correctly argued that the FCC should treat all spectrum equally. T-Mobile and Sprint wanted that screen to hobble the goliaths, and the Obama FCC took their side.</p><p>In dissent, then Republican Commissioner Mike O'Rielly warned that the FCC's \"decision seems to be reengineering the wireless market to reflect the Commission's vision of how it should be structured\" and that restricting participation in spectrum auctions \"needlessly jeopardizes [their] success\" and could reduce proceeds for the government.</p><p>Now AT&amp;T is turning the government sword against T-Mobile. AT&amp;T says a mid-band screen \"would assist the Commission in identifying spectrum aggregations that may cause competitive harm by allowing a licensee to hold so much mid-band spectrum in a given market that it becomes impossible for others to compete effectively.\"</p><p>But there's not a finite supply of spectrum. Engineers are finding new ways to free up more spectrum and make it more efficient all the time. It's hard to predict how technology will evolve. Few predicted a decade ago that mid-band would become the hot commodity, and regulating competition will retard innovation and investment.</p><p>AT&amp;T essentially wants the FCC to compensate for its bad business decisions. It should be careful what it asks government to do. Progressives say AT&amp;T's policy flip shows the FCC needs to regulate competition more aggressivelyâ€”for instance, by forcing internet providers to give competitors access to their networks. AT&amp;T may encourage a new command-and-control regulatory regime that all Americans will live to regret.</p><p>Big Business for Big Government</p>",
