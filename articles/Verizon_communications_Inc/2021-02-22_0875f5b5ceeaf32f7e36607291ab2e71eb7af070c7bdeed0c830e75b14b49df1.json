  "title": "Technology:  Starboard SPAC  Nears Deal to Buy  Data-Center Firm  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   A special-purpose acquisition company backed by shareholder activist Starboard Value LP is nearing a deal to combine with data-center provider Cyxtera Technologies Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>    Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. is discussing a deal that would value Cyxtera at around $3.4 billion including debt, the people said. It could be finalized by Monday assuming the talks don't fall apart, they said. </p><p>   Cyxtera's existing owners, including private-equity firms BC Partners and Medina Capital, plan to roll their equity stakes into the combined company, the people said. </p><p>   Cyxtera has more than 60 data centers around the world, serving thousands of companies and government agencies. It is one of the largest retail-colocation providers, with its data centers serving and connecting multiple customers and supporting the widespread adoption of hybrid-cloud infrastructure. Demand for data management was already on the rise thanks to the growth of everything from drones to internet-enabled gadgets when remote work and schooling necessitated by Covid-19 gave the sector an additional boost. </p><p>   SPACs, also called blank-check companies, have exploded in popularity. They raise money in an initial public offering and look for a business to combine with in a deal that gives the target an alternative route to the public markets. The Starboard vehicle raised $360 million when it went public last year. In addition to that, Cyxtera is expected to receive funds raised alongside the merger, as is typical in SPAC deals. </p><p>   BC Partners and Medina Capital combined CenturyLink Inc.'s portfolio of data centers and associated colocation business and assets from Medina in a roughly $2.8 billion deal that created Cyxtera in 2017. (CenturyLink last year renamed itself Lumen Technologies Inc.) </p><p>   Cyxtera is based in Miami and led by Chief Executive Officer Nelson Fonseca and Executive Chairman Manuel Medina, founder of Medina Capital. Both formerly ran information-technology-services provider Terremark Worldwide, which was sold to Verizon Communications Inc. in 2011 and later to Equinix Inc. </p><p>   Cyxtera had revenue of roughly $690 million in 2020, the people said. Other large players in retail colocation include Equinix and Digital Realty Trust Inc. </p><p>   Starboard is known for its activist campaigns and frequently invests in consumer and technology companies. It holds board seats at companies including Papa John's International Inc. and NortonLifeLock Inc. Several of Starboard's activist hedge-fund peers have also backed SPACs, including Engaged Capital LLC, Elliott Management Corp. and Pershing Square Capital Management. </p><p></p>",
