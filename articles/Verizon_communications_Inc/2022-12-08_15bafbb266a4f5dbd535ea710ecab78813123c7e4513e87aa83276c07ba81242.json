  "text": "<p>\"AT&amp;T's T wireless business has been a star in 2022 as the company has added substantial numbers of subscribers despite a price increase,\" Bonner wrote in a note to clients. \"Although it has not gained as many subscribers as industry leader T-Mobile, it has done better than Verizon's subscriber losses and anemic numbers.\"</p><p>Read: AT&amp;T exec says this trend should give investors 'confidence'</p><p>Bonner noted that AT&amp;T is now \"past its long, sad foray into the media business,\" having spun out WarnerMedia through a combination with Discovery. The company's streamlined focus on telecommunications could come to benefit it in the event of a downturn, he added.</p><p>\"The wireless business may remain resilient in a recession, given the value subscribers put on wireless connectivity though a recession would likely hurt its commercial enterprise business,\" he wrote.</p><p>Recent financial decisions could pay off as well, according to Bonner, who had a $24 price target on the stock in his latest note.</p><p>\"While telecoms are typically seen as safe havens in turbulent economic times, in AT&amp;T's case its focused debt reduction and refinancing in the last few years has made it more resilient in the current macro-environment,\" Bonner noted.</p><p>AT&amp;T shares were down 0.8% in afternoon trading Thursday despite the downgrade. They've gained about 3% so far this year as the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 17%.</p><p>AT&amp;T has been 'a star' this year. Why this analyst says its stock can be one too.</p>",
