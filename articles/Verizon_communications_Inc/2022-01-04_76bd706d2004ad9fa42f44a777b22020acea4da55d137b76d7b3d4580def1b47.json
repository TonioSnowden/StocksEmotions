  "text": "<p>The two companies on Sunday had rebuffed a Dec. 31 request by Mr. Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to delay their rollout of a new 5G signal for as long as two weeks to allow regulators to address safety concerns at airports on a rolling basis. The companies said they had already agreed to delay the rollout by a month to Jan. 5.</p><p>The sudden turn of events on Monday came as the FAA was preparing to soon issue flight restrictions that U.S. airlines worried would significantly disrupt air-travel and cargo shipments around the country, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Airlines for America, which represents major passenger and cargo carriers, had planned to ask a federal court to block the 5G rollout slated for Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said. The trade group held off once both telecom carriers agreed to further delay their 5G rollout until Jan. 19, these people said.</p><p>U.S. airlines have said their operations would face significant disruption if the FAA imposes flight restrictions to address the agency's safety concerns. The FAA and aviation groups worry the new 5G signals, frequencies known as the C-band, could interfere with cockpit safety systems.</p><p>The FAA said it thanked AT&amp;T and Verizon for agreeing to the voluntary delay and for their proposals to address safety concerns around airports.</p><p>The agency said the wireless companies have offered proposals comparable to those used in some European countries.</p>",
