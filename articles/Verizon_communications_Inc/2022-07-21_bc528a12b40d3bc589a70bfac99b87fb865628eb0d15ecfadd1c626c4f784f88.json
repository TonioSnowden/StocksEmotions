Theeuro strengthened 0.2% against the dollar to $1.02.</p><p>The ECB faces a related challenge in convincing investors that a new policy tool can shield fragile southern European economies from the risk of spiraling borrowing costs. Particularly vulnerable is Italy, where Mario Draghi resigned Thursday as prime minister. His decision hit Italian stocks, with the FTSE MIB falling 0.9%. By comparison, the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 inched up 0.3%.</p><p>A slew of disappointing corporate results across industries from telecommunications to airlines also weighed on the market.</p><p>AT&amp;T shares fell 8.9% after the company lowered its 2022 target for free cash flow. Verizon Communications also fell 3.3%, among the blue-chip Dow's top decliners.</p><p>Airline stocks retreated following weak reports.

Carnival dropped 12.2%, the biggest laggard on the S&amp;P 500. Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings also saw shares fall roughly 8% and 9%, respectively.</p><p>On the upside, Tesla shares rallied 7% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, providing support to the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The electric vehicle maker, however, reported its first decline in quarterly profit in more than a year.</p><p>Stocks have steadied in recent weeks after a challenging first half of the year. The three major averages are on pace for gains this week and for July.</p><p>Earnings reports from companies including Netflix have given investors greater confidence to buy up beaten-down tech stocks. Nonetheless, many money managers expect more volatility ahead as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates to curb inflation.</p><p>\"There's a bit more optimism around the growth sector than there was a couple of months ago,\" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. \"The key question is whether we have a big earnings recession heading into 2023.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, natural-gas prices in Europe fell 4.2% after Russia began to pump fuel through the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany at a reduced rate.
