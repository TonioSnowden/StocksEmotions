  "title": "Verizon stock gets an upgrade amid 'overly negative' sentiment and a strong dividend; Stock is the only member of the Dow in positive territory Thursday",
  "text": "<p>Verizon VZ trades at on an estimated 2023 free-cash-flow yield of 12%, he wrote, and the stock has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.4 times, which stands at a roughly 60% discount to the S&amp;P 500 SPX.</p><p>\"We think this valuation discount reflects uncertainty around earnings sustainability,\" Flannery said. While he expected some pressure from rates and other sources, he also saw the potential for better top-line trends and progress on cost-reduction initiatives to help with growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda).</p><p>The dividend is another key aspect of Verizon's story. The stock yields roughly 7%, which \"provides good downside support\" for the name and \"is historically high on an absolute level and relative to the yields on AT&amp;T T and the 10-year Treasury.\"</p><p>He noted that Verizon remains \"an out-of-consensus pick,\" as only six of the 30-plus analysts covering the stock have buy-equivalent ratings. Flannery, however, said he thinks the stock price \"is now discounting an overly negative relative outlook\" despite small signs of improvement.</p><p>Sentiment wasn't always so negative, but Verizon has struggled in 2022, delivering three quarters in a row of retail wireless postpaid subscriber losses. A major question on Wall Street is whether Verizon can turn things around given its reputation for a more disciplined approach to promotions as well as an evolving picture of network quality in the industry.</p><p>See also: Verizon stock has had a tough year. Is a 'drastic' shakeup in order?</p><p>\"In 2023, we believe that a revamped marketing and promotional stance, enhanced 5G performance, and FWA [fixed-wireless access] bundling can all help drive improved net add performance despite slowing industry growth,\" Flannery wrote. \"We also see an opportunity for Verizon to leverage the Tracfone prepaid base for potential postpaid customers once IT system upgrades are in place.\"</p><p>The stock, up 0.9% in morning trading, is currently the only member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA that's in positive territory on the day.</p><p>Verizon shares are off 27% so far in 2022, as AT&amp;T's stock is near flat and T-Mobile US Inc.'s TMUS is up 22%.</p><p>Verizon stock gets an upgrade amid 'overly negative' sentiment and a strong dividend</p>",
