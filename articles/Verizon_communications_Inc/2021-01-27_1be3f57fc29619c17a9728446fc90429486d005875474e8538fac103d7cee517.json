  "title": "Verizon Posts Earnings  Fall as Growth Wanes,  But Expects Rosier '21  ----  By Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>   Verizon Communications Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit slipped due to higher costs and a tepid pool of new customers, though the company issued an upbeat preview of earnings in 2021. </p><p>   The largest U.S. cellphone carrier said it expects wireless-service revenue growth to hit at least 3% this year while it continues to invest in upgrades to support fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G. The company said this year's capital spending would fall between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, roughly in line with last year's budget. </p><p>   The growth forecast followed a relatively slim gain of 279,000 postpaid phone connections in the last three months of 2020. That compared with a 790,000 increase over the year-earlier period. Telephone companies prize so-called postpaid accounts, which charge customers monthly bills after service is rendered, for their stable revenue. </p><p>   The core customer additions missed some Wall Street forecasts that had counted on brisk demand for Apple Inc.'s slate of iPhone 12 models. Industry analyst New Street Research had projected a net gain of 411,000 postpaid phone connections. </p><p>   Rival carrier T-Mobile US Inc. this month issued preliminary results that showed an 824,000 postpaid-phone gain over the same span. AT&amp;T Inc. plans to report its fourth-quarter results Wednesday. </p><p>   Verizon shares fell 3.2% to $56.67 on Tuesday. </p><p>   The company said its customers showed a strong appetite for new smartphones, though the coronavirus pandemic curbed foot traffic in its shops and limited new sign-ups. </p><p>   \"The Apple 5G phone came out late in the fourth quarter. That's when this all started at the same time as the pandemic,\" Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said during a call with analysts on Tuesday. \"Still, we are very pleased with what we have seen with our customers migrating to 5G.\" </p><p>   Verizon last year pulled its sales projections and braced for a wave of past-due bills as millions of Americans lost their jobs due to the pandemic. </p><p>   As the year wore on, revenue losses were limited by Verizon's more affluent customer base and the must-have nature of cellphone and home-internet service. </p><p>   On Tuesday, a network failure slowed internet service for some of Verizon's major business customers in the Northeast U.S., triggering a cascade of outages that blocked access to many online applications. The company hadn't pinned down the source of the failure as of Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman said the network suffered degraded service, which caused some high-bandwidth applications to stop working. </p><p>   The company's media business, which includes online brands like Yahoo, appeared to turn a corner in the fourth quarter. Its overall sales jumped 11% to $2.3 billion. The company said strong advertising demand lifted the division's results. </p><p>   Overall, quarterly net income attributed to Verizon reached $4.6 billion, down from $5.1 billion a year earlier. The most recent quarter took a $523 million hit from severance payments, the sale of the HuffPost media business and other one-time expenses. Revenue slipped 0.2% to $34.7 billion. </p><p>   The company said it remains on track to meet the cost-cutting goals executives set in late 2017. It at the time pledged to slash about $10 billion of expenses over four years. Verizon's past cost-cutting efforts don't account for the tens of billions of dollars that could be due in the coming years for new wireless licenses. </p><p></p>",
