  "title": "Business News: Price Rises Boost Caterpillar",
  "text": "<p>The company said Tuesday it expects sales in the second half of 2022 to benefit from elevated public-works spending in the U.S. and ongoing higher demand for mining equipment.</p><p>\"We remain encouraged by the strong demand in our markets,\" Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said during a call with analysts.</p><p>Caterpillar's quarterly results largely mirrored other U.S. manufacturers that have aggressively raised prices while demand for their products remains largely unaffected by falling consumer spending weighing on other industries. The equipment maker said higher prices for equipment contributed $1.1 billion to an 11% increase in second-quarter sales from the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Company shares fell 5.8%.</p><p>Caterpillar said its manufacturing costs rose by $966 million from a year earlier. The company's operating margin was down slightly in the period, to 13.6% from 13.9% a year ago. The company said it continues to experience shortages of components that held down machinery production during the quarter. Market prices for metals, freight and other expenses have been falling lately, but the company said the reductions haven't yet lowered Caterpillar's costs.</p><p>\"We're still dealing with an inflationary environment,\" said Mr. Umpleby. \"It takes a while for those kinds of changes to work their way through the supply chain.\"</p><p>In June, Caterpillar said it would move its headquarters to Irving, Texas, from Deerfield, Ill., joining some other major U.S. companies weighing hiring and other costs in relocating their headquarters. Caterpillar said the company wasn't getting economic or tax incentives to relocate to Texas.</p><p>Sales of its construction equipment overall rose 7% during the quarter, despite a 17% drop in sales in the Asia-Pacific region and a 7% decline in Europe, the Middle East and Africa that the company attributed to unfavorable currency-exchange rates. Lower construction-equipment sales from Asia stemmed from weaker demand for large excavators in China. Industry analysts have said lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19 have damped demand in China.</p><p>Sales of mining equipment rose 16% in the quarter, with particularly strong demand coming from North America and Asia. The company said higher production of electric vehicles has accelerated demand for mined minerals used in electric components.</p><p>For the three months ended June 30, Caterpillar reported a profit of $1.67 billion, or $3.13 a share, up from $1.41 billion, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
