  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: Boots on an Epic Scale --- Frankensteinian footwear has become increasingly popular -- and not because it's particularly practical",
  "text": "<p>This beast of a boot isn't the only monster stomping through the footwear market. Bottega Veneta peddles the $1,350 Tire Boot, another calf-consuming Chelsea boot with a seriously large sole. Moncler has issued a series of menacing rubber muck boots that give the wearer an added inch or two. Even Cat Footwear, the brand owned by stalwart construction-equipment company Caterpillar, sells fashion-leaning footwear, including towering, glossy $140 boots that, according to the brand's website, provide a \"futuristic, trend-led finish while protecting you from the elements.\"</p><p>Men's fashion is in a big moment -- particularly in the shoe department. Balenciaga helped initiate the wave in 2017 when it released the Triple S, an obese sneaker atop a triple-stacked sole. That shoe -- and similar overfed, elevated sneakers from Gucci down to Converse -- whetted consumers' appetites for mundo, highly conspicuous footwear. \"People who are buying status footwear want to be recognizable,\" said Bruce Pask, men's fashion director at Neiman Marcus. \"We've been moving in that direction of having more statement-making footwear.\"</p><p>Beefy men's boots have a long history. Weighty Wellingtons, a British hunting staple, date back centuries. Hulking Dr. Martens have been with us since 1947. Construction workers clock the hours in steel-toe work boots, while Harley-Davidson owners yank on armor-like boots that cover nearly half their legs. (Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has lately sported a pair of discontinued Red Wing work boots that might easily weigh 20 pounds. Cosplaying fans have been clamoring for the hard-to-find boots; a pair recently sold for over $3,000 on eBay.)</p><p>In the hands of contemporary designers, boots just keep getting more extreme. Andre Vargas, 27, a New Yorker working in digital marketing, owns a pair of NSLTD boots from Ye's Yeezy line with Adidas, which resemble a Timberland crossbred with a puffer jacket. \"They're definitely a unique boot,\" said Mr. Vargas. That's putting it mildly. His friends have dubbed the marshmallowy stompers his \"astronaut boots\" and, in them, Mr. Vargas looks ready to bound across Mars instead of Manhattan.</p><p>Other colossal boots lack such extreme fluffiness but are no less conspicuous. Photographer Jeremy Fuder, 29, owns a pair of those slick leather Bottega Veneta Tire Boots. The boots' muscular, oversized gray sole is more striking than that of a flat, ankle-high Chelsea but is \"not super comfortable,\" he conceded. And when Chicago streets swarm with snow, the Bottegas barely perform better than the lithe Hoka One One sneaker boots Mr. Fuder wears most winter days. As a result, he thinks of his commanding boots the way some women think of high heels: as a pure aesthetic indulgence. \"Is there a benefit? No. But it's a style choice.\"</p><p>For many, style matters. Joevi Flores, 22, a retail worker in Gaithersburg, Md., likes how burly boots look with the roomier trousers he's been wearing of late. In recent years men's fashion has gravitated away from the shrunken suits and taut jeans of the early 2000s. A round, robust boot, like the Dr. Martens x Rick Owens pair that Mr. Flores wears, complements straight-leg pants better, more substantially, than the tapered Chelsea boots that once filled department stores. And at 5'9\", Mr. Flores welcomes the extra few inches of height, too.</p><p>But that lift comes at a cost. \"Do they weigh [me] down? Quite a bit,\" said Justin Nguyen, 30, the owner of a sneaker store and cafe in Seattle, referring to his Rick Owens Tractor boots. The sole of these leather chunkers is a rubbery monstrosity. And while Mr. Nguyen likes their dramatic, almost Frankensteinian silhouette, he did note that wearing such an overweight boot took some getting used to. Some \"big\"-looking boots can weigh less than you think, thanks to soles that might appear solid but are filled with air, or thinned-down rubber. These designs can weigh in at just a couple of pounds, a bit heftier than a sneaker.</p><p>Mr. Pask largely dismisses concerns that these unwieldy boots are too heavy, given how well they are selling at Neiman's stores. \"I think we can handle a bit of weight and the muscle-building that may come attendant to that.\" That's another way to think of these big boots: as just a really, really expensive calf workout.</p>",
