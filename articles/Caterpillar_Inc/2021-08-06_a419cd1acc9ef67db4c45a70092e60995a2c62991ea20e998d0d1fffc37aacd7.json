  "text": "<p>Big Conservative donors have retained a public relations company part-owned by the party co-chair Ben Elliot, raising further questions about the blurring of his business and political interests.</p> <p>Elliot has faced increasing scrutiny over the overlap between his business networks and his fundraising duties for the Conservatives since Prime Minister Boris Johnson installed him at the head of the party in July 2019.</p> <p>Last week the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8a48bfd-8902-4667-93a6-1b903ca48e7e\">revealed</a> that Elliot, 45, oversees a secretive Tory “Advisory Board”, some of whose members had given at least £250,000 to the party, which regularly meets Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>Sir Keir Starmer, Labour leader, claimed this appeared to be a case of “cash for access on a huge scale”. He told the FT that “one of the biggest challenges at the next election is cleaning up politics”, claiming Johnson had presided over a culture of “sleaze”. </p> <p>Elliot, the nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, helped the Conservative party raise record sums from large donors in the 2019 election.</p> <p>But he has also faced criticism over his handling of a dispute involving Mohamed Amersi, a donor and client of Elliot's upmarket concierge business, Quintessentially. A former Conservative MP on the other side of the dispute, Charlotte Leslie, this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acf45616-76e4-4e31-8252-a661c1ee4608\">accused</a> Elliot of mixing his political role with his business interests.</p> <p>The Financial Times has uncovered new links between Elliot's business interests and party affairs in the form of three major party donors who are currently clients of Hawthorn Advisors, a PR firm he co-founded.</p> <p>Elliot stepped down as a Hawthorn director in April 2020 but retains a 22 per cent stake, meaning he still enjoys a share of the profits the company makes from client fees. The three donors, which have given the Conservatives almost £1.2m since Elliot became party co-chair, currently pay Hawthorn for PR services.</p> <p>Elliot's spokesperson said: “As a matter of policy Ben does not seek donations from Hawthorn clients. There is an extensive fundraising team at the Conservative party. He has no involvement in Hawthorn work and never speaks to Hawthorn clients about their work with the company.”</p> <p>Hawthorn said: “Ben has been an investor in Hawthorn since 2013, long before he took up his unpaid position as chair of the Conservative party. He has never been actively involved in the business. Ben's shares are in trust and he remains entirely removed from the business.” </p> <p>In 2018, GQ reported in a profile of Johnny Depp, the actor who Hawthorn represented, that Elliot had personally got in touch with the magazine to arrange the <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/johnny-depp-interview-2018\">profile</a>. Hawthorn said that did not amount to being involved in the company's business.</p> <p>As well as PR, the company does lobbying. While lobbyists are required by law to identify their clients on a public registry, there is no such rule for PR work.</p> <p>Hawthorn's PR clients include Britannia Financial Group, a London-headquartered brokerage and wealth management firm controlled by Julio Herrera, a Venezuelan banker. Herrera's executive assistant as chair of BFG was Elliot's private assistant until September 2020, according to LinkedIn. BFG has given the Conservative party £472,000 since December 2019, including a £250,000 donation in November. BFG confirmed that the company retained Hawthorn last year and had no comment.</p> <p>Mercantile &amp; Maritime, a commodities trading firm founded by Murtaza Lakhani, a former Glencore oil trader, said it contracted Hawthorn for PR services “following a competitive pitch process which they took part in alongside several other agencies”, adding that “Hawthorn was originally introduced to us by a law firm that we work with”. Hawthorn was referenced as Lakhani's representative in press reports in March 2020 and January this year. The group's UK arm gave the Conservatives £500,000 in November 2019. </p> <p>A third donor is Unatrac Limited, which distributes Caterpillar equipment and belongs to the family business empire of Mohamed Mansour, an Egyptian tycoon. Unatrac has given the Conservatives £530,000 since 2015, including £210,000 since Elliot became co-chair. In 2018, the investment arm of Mansour's family group became a client of Hawthorn. Mansour and his group did not comment. </p> <p>Hawthorn currently lobbies for Huawei, the Chinese technology group that the UK has banned from the country's 5G infrastructure.</p> <p>On the issue of the Advisory Board, the Conservatives argued this week that Labour has its own donors' club, the “Chair's Circle” which offers those who give £5,000 to the party a chance to meet Starmer and other shadow cabinet members.</p> <p>But Starmer, speaking during a visit to Scotland, said this was different from the Advisory Board, a body whose existence had never previously been formally acknowledged.</p> <p>“I have a network of people who have donated to the Labour party,” he told the FT in an interview. “We don't do any deals, we don't do special offers and certainly don't have an Advisory Board.”</p> <p>He said there was a need for “full transparency” over the membership of the Advisory Board and who it met.</p><p>Source: Kadhim Shubber, Tom Burgis, George Parker and Jim Pickard in London 2021 'Tory donors use PR firm part-owned by chief fundraiser Ben Elliot' FT.com 6 August.
