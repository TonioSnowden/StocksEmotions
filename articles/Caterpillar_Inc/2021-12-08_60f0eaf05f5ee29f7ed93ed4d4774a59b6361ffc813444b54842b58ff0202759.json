  "text": "<p>\n  Welcome to Earth </p><p>\n  Wednesday, Disney+ </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'Welcome to Earth\" seems something of a misnomer: \"Welcome to Yourself\" might have been better, even if it has the ring of self-improvement about it. But who is to say that a nature show won't make us better people? Hosted by actor Will Smith, who is convincingly and charmingly apprehensive about what he's about to dive into, the six-part series relates to the world as the world relates to our senses, or eludes them: From the depths of the sea to the rim of a volcano, there are sounds, smells and colors that we don't normally experience, because they're ignored, obscured or out of our reach. What \"Welcome to Earth\" explores, like a Mungo Park of the mind, are not just places but human perceptions, and the crafty ways Mother Nature conceals herself. </p><p>\n  Deftly directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"Black Swan,\" \"Requiem for a Dream\"), the show is visually startling, from the phosphorescent marine life darting under a glass-bottomed boat in Puerto Rico's Mosquito Bay to the eyeless \"human fish\" that live -- as they have for 20 million years of darkness -- under the Karst Plateau in Slovenia. Or the \"moon-bow\" that's perceived -- \"with the right camera and the right lenses,\" says a photographer -- over Iguaco Falls in Brazil. Much of what we're getting we would never see without a cinematographic advantage, but that's what makes so much of \"Welcome to Earth\" so mysteriously seductive: an invisible, or barely visible, parallel existence on which the show shines a man-made light. </p><p>\n  Light itself is the focus of episode 1, which also involves a daunting journey: to the bottom of the Atlantic, off Bermuda, in a bubble-hooded submersible called the Nadir (not the most auspicious name, something Mr. Smith nervously acknowledges). Our host admits to being edgy; fortunately, he doesn't seem to notice the crewman blessing himself as the craft -- containing Mr. Smith, the marine biologist/diver Diva Amon and their pilot -- is launched into the water. En route to 3,300 feet, the colors of the spectrum vanish, one after another, as sunlight eventually disappears altogether; Mr. Smith's red shirt, which someone insisted he wear, turns blue as the natural light from the surface gradually goes out. In the artificial glow of the Nadir, it's possible to see fish of vibrant colors. Why? Because without a camera light these colors render them invisible to predators. </p><p>\n  Mr. Smith doesn't get to every location visited by \"Welcome to Earth.\" Ecologist Jonathan Martin and photographer George Steinmetz, for instance, with the aid of a UV light, go night-stalking and find \"disco-painted\" squirrels in the forests of Wisconsin. But in episode 2, which is concerned with sound, Mr. Smith accompanies the mountaineer and adventurer Erik Weihenmayer (the first blind person to reach the summit of Everest) to Mount Yasur, a very active volcano in the South Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu. What they study, besides the spurting lava and flying rocks around them, are the sounds, the way deep, tremulous vibrations are absorbed by the body and how much sound becomes imperceptible to human ears amid the day-to-day din around them. Mr. Weihenmayer is an excellent guide to the sonic map of Mount Yasur. </p><p>\n  Episode 4 (episodes 1, 2 and 4 were available for review) involves scent -- the way tiger sharks converge on Raine Island in Australia every year, or the way the smell of fresh cut grass affects the human brain, as compared with, say, that of a predatory bird. For many of us, mown grass evokes immediate memories, the chemicals released having an instant effect on our minds. The same chemicals are released when a caterpillar chews a blade of grass. Hungry birds know the difference. For them, \"it's not the smell of summer,\" Mr. Smith notes. \"It's the smell of lunch.\" At the same time, Mr. Weihenmayer can smell the salmon when rafting down a river. A lot of people would really like to take him fishing. </p><p></p>",
