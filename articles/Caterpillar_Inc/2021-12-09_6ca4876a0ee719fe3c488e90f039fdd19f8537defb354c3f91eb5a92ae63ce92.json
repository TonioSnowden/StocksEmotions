  "title": "Caterpillar CFO Navigates Customers' Varying Appetite for Decarbonization; Andrew Bonfield talks about ESG bonds, technological changes and moving dirt",
  "text": "<p>He talked to CFO Journal about ESG bonds, technological changes and moving dirt. Here are edited excerpts.</p><p>WSJ: You previously served as CFO of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Cadbury PLC and National Grid PLC. What made you join Caterpillar?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: This is now my sixth public company CFO role. For me, one of the interesting things is [that] finance is fungible across different [sectors]. In many ways, accounting is accounting, regardless [of] what sector or segment you are in. Caterpillar is obviously an iconic brand. And, the second part was, I had never worked in a cyclical industrial company.</p><p>WSJ: What were the core differences between these CFO roles?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: In pharmaceuticals, it's all about research. In consumer goods, it's a lot more about marketing. In utilities, it's efficient funding of energy to the consumer.</p><p>[At Caterpillar], [what's] different is it's much more heavy manufacturing. Getting your head around the impact of having about 60% of your profit and loss related to the cost of goods sold is very different from where I've been in previous industries. I learned this during the consumer days: You go through a period of expanding margins, and then a period of volume growth. The problem is to do both at the same time. That's what we're trying to do [at] Caterpillar.</p><p>WSJ: How far are you dealing with a different type of investors?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: Investors think through cyclical businesses very differently from how they think through a consumer-products business. Ultimately, you're trying to drive volume growth and you're trying to drive margin improvement. Those are the holy grail for every company. One of the things we've been doing a lot more is targeting shareholders. Trying to get people to think differently about Caterpillar through things like cash generation is really important for us.</p><p>WSJ: How about environmental, social and governance goals, do you get more questions about those?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: ESG has become an important part of every company's outlook. Everyone is aware that decarbonization is occurring and needs to occur. Many people [view the energy transition as a risk for Caterpillar], because \"you guys produce diesel engines, and therefore, that must be a risk for you.\" \"You have a business in oil and gas, that must be risky.\" We actually think the energy transition is a great opportunity for Caterpillar.</p><p>WSJ: Why is that?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: If you think about the commodities that need to be produced to drive electric batteries, that's an opportunity for us within our mining business. [Also], we are an integrator of technologies. We move dirt and moving dirt requires a lot of other things. It's hydraulic cylinders. It's engine technology. There's a whole lot of other things that go into building an excavator or a wheeled loader or a track-type tractor. We're working on hydrogen technology, battery technology, [similar to] a lot of our competitors.</p><p>WSJ: What are the challenges around these technologies?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: The energy transition means different things to different customers. It's not one size fits all. For example, if you're thinking about a construction project, if you've got bulldozers and excavators and [other] things on site, how are you going to decarbonize those [if] you don't have a grid connection?</p><p>WSJ: How likely are your customers to make changes to their operations?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: It depends, product by product and the scale of the project. Big public entities are moving the fastest. [For] mining companies, large mining trucks are one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions. So for them, that's a priority. For a small, family-owned construction company that's not publicly quoted in the U.S. and working on a road project that [doesn't have] a requirement for the owner to move to a battery electric operation, probably they're going to be the last people to move. It depends how quickly regulations change.</p><p>WSJ: Few people buy a new excavator every year. What does that mean for your customers' efforts to reduce carbon emissions?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: Obviously, a lot of our machines last for many years and customers will obviously don't want to change until they have to. So it depends on the life cycle of their machine. And then it depends on what they see [as] the application. A mini excavator or a skid steer that is operated by a landscaping company in an urban area is probably more likely to move quicker [toward] battery electric than a large bulldozer, which is working on a road project very far away from a battery or electrical connection.</p><p>WSJ: How about ESG-related financing, do you see Caterpillar selling green bonds any time soon?</p><p>Mr. Bonfield: Because we're in a strong balance sheet position, we probably don't have much [need] for actually issuing new debt. So it's probably not going to be a high priority.</p><p>Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>Caterpillar CFO Navigates Customers' Varying Appetite for Decarbonization</p>",
