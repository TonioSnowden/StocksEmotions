Less so for teammates.</h1> <p>Sunday's <strong>Super Bowl </strong>between the <strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers </strong>and <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong> is one for the ages: a shoot out between future hall-of-fame quarterbacks <strong>Tom Brady </strong>and <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>.</p> <p>At the age of 43, Brady is back in the big game in his first season with the Buccs, having won six rings with the <strong>New England Patriots</strong>. He is widely considered the greatest quarterback of all time, a title which may eventually be taken by Mahomes, who at 25 could become <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-will-make-super-bowl-history-as-soon-as-they-take-their-first-snaps/\">the youngest QB to win multiple Super Bowls</a> if the Chiefs win on Sunday.</p> <p>Off the gridiron, it's no surprise that both players are massive celebrity endorsers. Mahomes has done ads for everything from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2zXyQiaafU\">ketchup</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bne0vIGjA\">shampoo</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp6_s0B2dmw\">insurance</a>. Brady <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tom-brady-lot-endorsements-see-130002200.html\">has deals with</a> a watch brand, a brewer and Ugg slippers, among others.</p> <p>This week, one of Brady's endorsement deals got a bit more complicated. <strong>Under Armour </strong>said it will end its on-field licensing agreement with the <strong>National Football League</strong>, a contract which essentially permits the sportswear company to put its products on the hands and feet of players during games.&#xa0;</p> <p>The end of the contract, first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59119533-282a-48dc-8b6f-7d0d6edada5f?shareType=nongift\">reported by the FT</a>, coincides with a massive marketing retrenchment by Under Armour, which has pared back its spending on outfitting deals since the onset of the pandemic.</p> <p>For marquee players like Brady, losing the ability to wear Under Armour gloves during <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/tom-brady-breaks-silence-on-high-five-snub\">occasionally unreturned high-fives</a> won't sink <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/tom-brady-net-worth-200053559.html\">his reported net worth</a> of $200m.</p> <p>Nor will it hurt the NFL, where total sponsorship spending reached nearly $1.5bn during the most recent season, according to IEG, with more than 350 new deals signed.</p> <p>The consequences of Under Armour's decision will be felt more by the league's more than two thousand other players. They will be left with one fewer suitor to outfit their most visible individual real estate on the field.&#xa0;</p> <p>One consultant said the collapse of the Under Armour contract is leading non A-list players to rethink their earnings potential. In some cases, that means signing shorter-term deals — endorsements for just one season, as opposed to the typical two or three years. Or signing with other, smaller companies which can now afford to sponsor an NFL player as rates for individuals have gone down.</p> <p>Such issues are not faced by Brady or Mahomes. Already attractive to marketers, they are aiming to burnish their sporting legend on Sunday. Their teammates will hope smaller endorsement deals are the spoils of victory.</p> <h1>Crisis averted in French football, for now.</h1> <p>It's been a rollercoaster week for the top flight of French football, <em>writes Paris correspondent Leila Abboud in a dispatch for Scoreboard.</em></p> <p>Let's recap. On Monday, <strong>Ligue 1 </strong>tried to resell its TV rights for 2020-2024 after its previous broadcaster, the heavily indebted <strong>Mediapro</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6494e014-3ae1-4352-a7dd-0e0e5b816729\"> backed out</a> of its €780m annual<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a2f2696-fd2d-4e02-a838-2f537b1aea28\"> deal</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mediapro's spectacular failure had left club presidents looking at massive holes in their budgets so the auction was high stakes. But none of the four bidders, including <strong>Amazon </strong>and <strong>DAZN</strong>, met the reserve price — the minimum amount demanded by the league. So Ligue 1 had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61326e1f-afde-4664-ba4c-939e0c00b3fb\">call it all off</a>.</p> <p>This left the unpalatable prospect of the broadcast schedule going dark from February 3, the last day that Mediapro's Telefoot channel had planned to operate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Notably absent were two groups that boycotted Monday's auction: <strong>Vivendi</strong>-owned pay TV channel <strong>Canal Plus</strong>, which for decades broadcast the games before the league's flirtation with Mediapro, and Qatar's <strong>beIN Sports</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Canal Plus had filed a lawsuit to challenge the auction. It was playing hardball to try to force the league to put all its TV rights back up for sale — not only in Mediapro's contract, but also a smaller package of games worth €330m that Canal Plus held under licence from beIN. The league refused this demand, but then couldn't find a replacement broadcaster.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Wednesday came a glimmer of hope. Led by Ligue 1 president<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2021/01/30/l-avenir-du-football-francais-dans-les-mains-de-vincent-labrune_6068219_3242.html\"> <strong>Vincent Labrune</strong></a>, a deal with Canal Plus and Telefoot was announced to broadcast the clash between arch-rivals <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong> and <strong>Olympique de Marseille</strong> on Sunday night. Fans breathed a sigh of relief at the stopgap.</p> <p>Another twist came on Thursday night — the fruit of what one imagines were some tense negotiations between Labrune and Canal Plus boss <strong>Maxime Saada</strong>. The pair announced that Canal Plus would broadcast all matches for the rest of this season.</p> <p>No price was disclosed but Agence France-Presse reported that Canal Plus would only pay an additional €35m on top of the €330m it was already paying. If accurate, this represents a big haircut for the league this year: overall €680m (a figure that includes what Mediapro has already paid) instead of the €1.2bn promised at the start of the season.</p> <p>The agreement gives clubs some certainty at least. Rebuilding French football's reputation after months of slow-motion crisis and repairing trust with Canal Plus will take time. They should make a start before the haggling over next season's rights begins.</p> <h1>Basketball to volleyball, private equity expands net for sports deals</h1> <p>Private equity's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24e9fc43-4187-4884-8efe-7a6efb496f24\">push into sports</a> has already reached football, rugby union, motorsports and even volleyball, <em>writes private capital correspondent Kaye Wiggins in a dispatch for Scoreboard.</em>&#xa0;</p> <p>Next up: disrupting the longstanding ownership structures of basketball teams. Luxembourg-based buyout group <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong> is in talks to buy a minority stake in the <strong>San Antonio Spurs</strong>, the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b70afbd7-d207-46dc-9055-708312de1d9a\">revealed this week</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>And while the two sides have been talking for a year, the <strong>National Basketball Association</strong>'s recent decision to change its franchise ownership rules, which allows a new group of private institutions to buy in for the first time, has given them a boost.&#xa0;</p> <p>CVC wants a roughly 15 per cent stake in the five-time NBA champions owned by the <strong>Holt family</strong> of Texas, which controls the <strong>Caterpillar </strong>industrial vehicles company. The buyout firm has picked its moment well. The value of NBA franchises has surged, leaving many holders of minority stakes — so-called “limited partners” — looking for a way to cash in on their assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>One thing CVC wants from sports investments is governance rights to go with its money. It is already<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e57f79b2-54b0-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"> planning to use stakes in rugby union competitions </a>to reshape the global game. This week, CVC announced a $300m investment with the <strong>International Volleyball Federation</strong>, gaining significant commercial power over that sport's global events.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's not exactly clear how these governance demands will play out in the NBA, where private equity ownership is a new concept, and where current rules say institutional investors must be passive.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the discussions tap into a bigger theme that underpins the past year's flurry of private equity interest in sports deals: control.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now that the coronavirus pandemic has left many cash-strapped clubs and leagues willing to consider taking private equity's money for the first time, they have to ask themselves how much influence they are willing to hand over in exchange.&#xa0;</p> <p>One reason CVC missed out to US rival <strong>Silver Lake Partners</strong> in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f3de1de-6a1f-47b6-8f98-93899edad892\">deal to invest</a> in the body behind the <strong>New Zealand All Blacks</strong> rugby team is its demands to be an active “partner” in the business, not merely a hands off “investor,” according to people close to the discussions.</p> <p>One thing is for sure: any agreement that CVC reaches with the Spurs could set the tone for future deals in the NBA, with the potential to reshape the power structures in one of the world's most popular sports.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Hightlights</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The organisers of the<strong> Tokyo Olympics </strong>laid out a “playbook” to enable the summer games to go ahead despite the pandemic. Measures include: constant tests for Covid-19, 14 days of restricted movement and a ban on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/366c3b2e-5f9f-4491-a24f-40c363e1def8\">cheering for athletes</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Yoshiro Mori</strong>, president of the <strong>Tokyo 2020 </strong>organising committee, created a storm of criticism by saying women do not belong on committees because they talk too much. He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b5b195a-d335-4784-b3cd-291e775f16f4\">refused to resign</a>, though apologised for his “inappropriate” remarks.</p></li>  <li><p>The FT's Andrew Hill interviewed <strong>Tottenham Hotspur </strong>coach <strong>José Mourinho</strong> at <strong>Web Summit. </strong>The pair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d420877a-0ffc-4351-9eaf-680d8049addd\">discussed</a> the lessons that football managers might have for their peers in business.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Suning Holdings</strong>, the Chinese owners of <strong>Inter Milan</strong>, are rushing to raise at least $200m in emergency cash after the Italian football club's finances deteriorated due to the pandemic and heavy spending on top players, the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fdc9a56-75c9-4101-b5c5-bf827a0e7b1d\">revealed this week</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>Spain's El Mundo newspaper <a href=\"https://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/2021/01/31/60154779fdddfff4a78b461e.html\">splashed its front page</a> last weekend with details of <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>'s playing contract at <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>. Top line? The Argentine will earn more than half a billion euros by the end of his four year contract.</p></li>  <li><p>More than 500 tennis players and staff at the <strong>Australian Open</strong> in Melbourne were <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/03/world/australia-open-tennis-coronavirus-intl/index.html\">forced into quarantine</a> after a hotel worker tested positive for coronavirus. <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, Victoria state premier, said the drastic move was needed out of “an abundance of caution.”</p></li>  <li><p>Ahead of the <strong>Six Nations</strong>, Europe's top rugby union tournament, England star <strong>Maro Itoje </strong>spoke to FT Weekend Magazine on race, class, privilege, education, the problem of concussion in his sport and his reaction when a teammate at <strong>Saracens</strong> used the “N-word.” It's worth reading the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee64bcea-b5d2-4941-a1ba-7621d57a5f0e?\">full interview here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Transfer Market</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Andy Jassy</strong>, co-owner of<strong> Seattle Kraken</strong>, an expansion franchise in North America's <strong>National Hockey League</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b100100e-48d9-4b06-86e0-ed81dd9eee92\">soon have a new job</a>: chief executive of <strong>Amazon</strong>. Currently head of cloud computing arm <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, Jassy will be promoted once <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> steps aside later this year.</p></li>  <li><p>Former Arsenal player turned entrepreneur <strong>Matthieu Flamini</strong> has been <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/atomico-angel-programme-2021/\">made an angel investor</a> at <strong>Atomico</strong>, one of Europe's top tech venture capital firms which is seeking a new cohort of investors with a “diversity of experiences”.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <p>Press conferences in the <strong>English Premier League </strong>are usually humdrum affairs. So <strong>Burnley</strong> manager <strong>Sean Dyche</strong> was delighted, instead of being asked about tactics, to be informed by a reporter of his uncanny resemblance to <strong>Mick Hucknall, </strong>the lead singer of Simply Red. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptusSport/status/1356867769354964999?s=20\">Dyche warmed to the theme</a> of “lookalikes” in a session that quickly went off the rails.</p> <p>---</p> <p><em>Scoreboard is written by Samuel Agini, Murad Ahmed and Arash Massoudi in London, Sara Germano, James Fontanella-Khan, and Anna Nicolaou in New York, with contributions from the team that produce the Due Diligence newsletter, the FT's global network of correspondents and data visualisation team.&#xa0;&#xa0;</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Scoreboard: Tom Brady vs Patrick Mahomes is a sponsor's dream Super Bowl.
