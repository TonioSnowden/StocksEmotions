  "title": "Business News: Construction Boosts Caterpillar's Earnings",
  "text": "<p>\"The good news is that demand remains strong,\" said Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar's chief financial officer. \"The challenge for us was around supply,\" he said.</p><p>Caterpillar's sales to equipment users grew 14% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, below its expectations of at least 15%, driven by constraints to the company's supply chain, Mr. Bonfield said.</p><p>\"When the chain starts getting as stretched as it is, it doesn't take a lot for one or two things to put you in a situation where you have to change production schedules,\" he said.</p><p>Caterpillar's shares rose 4% Thursday.</p><p>Caterpillar and other manufacturers are dealing with congestion at ports, higher trucking and airfreight costs and difficulties finding many types of parts, including computer chips.</p><p>Manufacturing executives have said the problems are driven by strong orders of goods across the board, stretching the industry's ability to produce enough to fulfill the demand.</p><p>The Deerfield, Ill.-based maker of mining trucks and construction bulldozers said revenue grew 25% to $12.4 billion in its third quarter, driven by higher prices and volumes.</p><p>The company earned a profit of $2.60 a share, compared with $1.22 a share a year earlier. Total profit was $1.43 billion, up from $668 million.</p><p>On an adjusted basis, Caterpillar's profit was $2.66 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.31 a share.</p><p>Higher manufacturing costs offset price increases Caterpillar implemented for customers. Higher prices added $256 million to operating profit while higher manufacturing costs reduced it by $267 million, the company said.</p><p>Construction sales climbed 30% to $5.26 billion while mining sales grew by 32% to $2.41 billion. The company's energy-and-transportation sales rose 22% to $5.08 billion.</p>",
