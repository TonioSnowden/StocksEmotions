  "text": "<p>   The S&amp;P 500 jumped to a record after President Biden and a group of senators agreed on a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 322.58 points or 0.95% Thursday to 34196.82. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 added 24.65 points, or 0.6%, to 4266.49. The Nasdaq Composite rose 97.98 points, or 0.7%, to 14369.71, also a record. </p><p>   Stocks have quickly rebounded from a steep selloff last week that was fueled in part by worries that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates sooner than expected. </p><p>   Major indexes have reclaimed highs in recent sessions and market volatility has collapsed, reflecting investors' easing concerns about higher inflation and tighter monetary policy. Money managers have grown more confident that interest rates won't rise for a while, sending technology stocks roaring higher in recent days. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on track for their best weeks since April, while the Dow is headed toward its best weekly performance since March. </p><p>   \"In the context of strong growth, markets can digest slightly less supportive monetary policy,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"The outlook for earnings is still pretty strong. I think central banks can afford to think about removing some of what's been put in place.\" </p><p>   Mr. Biden and a group of senators agreed to a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure plan on transportation and broadband. News of the deal reinvigorated a market that had already been swiftly rebounding from big declines last week. </p><p>   Caterpillar shares jumped $5.55, or 2.6%, to $219.34. Construction-aggregates producer Vulcan Materials leapt $5.57, or 3.3%, to $175.90. </p><p>   The revival in stocks offering potentially high future growth marks a sharp shift. For many months, investors had piled into corners of the market that would benefit from rising bond yields and an improving economy, like the energy and financials sectors within the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   And in one sign of investors' return to growth stocks, Tesla shares rallied, gaining $23.25, or 3.5%, to $679.82. </p><p>   The latest data on weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, showed that 411,000 people applied for unemployment benefits. That was slightly less than the prior week's 418,000, which stemmed from an unexpected increase. </p><p>   Orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May, albeit at a slower pace than economists expected. Orders slipped in April, partly because the global computer-chip shortage. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.9%, while the U.K. benchmark FTSE 100 edged up 0.5%. </p><p>   Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei  was up 0.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.8%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
