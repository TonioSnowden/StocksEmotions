  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Spring Books:  Nature  ----  By David P. Barash",
  "text": "<p>   As we learn from Ecclesiastes, \"to everything there is a season.\" This includes a season of books mirroring spring's lively outdoor efflorescence. For many, spring is synonymous with flowers and birds. Too few, however, appreciate the birth, emergence and arrival of those remarkable organisms the insects, whose three pairs of legs, segmented bodies and exoskeletons betoken membership in what might be the most species-rich, profuse, and downright fascinating collection of living things. </p><p>   Internally, insects differ from vertebrates in having an open circulatory system -- blood simply perfuses their organs and oxygen is transported not via specialized blood cells but by a vast network of tubules connected directly to the outside air. These characteristics limit insects' body size, notwithstanding fantasies of Brobdingnagian butterflies or mammoth moths. By contrast, there is little limit to the diversity of insects themselves, a spectrum celebrated in an set of new books that could charm the most committed insectophobe. </p><p>   We might start with \"Wasps: The Astonishing Diversity of a Misunderstood Insect\" (Princeton, 256 pages, $29.95), by Eric R. Eaton, who writes that \"it is the mission of this book to turn fear and loathing into fascination and admiration.\" Mission accomplished! Mr. Eaton, author of several field guides to butterflies and other North American insects, can be a bit textbookish. But gorgeous illustrations, many of them -- like their subjects -- glittering with metallic luster, create an arrestingly beautiful volume. Starting with early ancestral forms, Mr. Eaton takes us on a comprehensive tour of the wide world of the wasp, which includes many solitary forms, along with the better known, picnic-disrupting yellow jackets and hornets. Even the casual page-flipper will reel at the implications of being literally wasp-waisted, not to mention at metamorphosis, whereby a wormlike larva becomes a magnificent flying dragon. From pseudocopulation (orchids trick male wasps into pollinating) to their ferocious predation upon spiders and other fellow arthropods, Mr. Eaton's book is worthy of its wondrous creatures. </p><p>   As for their fabled stings, Mr. Eaton makes it clear that most wasps are not only harmless to people but downright beneficial, pollinating plants and preying on pests. Writing of the best-known family, the vespids (paper wasps, yellow jackets and hornets), he finds it \"a wonder that any caterpillar or fly escapes these hunters. It is equally amazing that we usually escape being stung, though that is a testament to the tolerance of the wasps more so than our tolerance for them.\" </p><p>   \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise!\" says Proverbs, not to be outdone by Ecclesiastes. Myrmecologists, who study these famously industrious insects, have taken heed, revealing ants as the extraordinary beings they are: not kaleidoscopically colored like wasps (most ants are black, red or brown, though a few are partly green) but with full-time castes of workers, queens, drones and in some cases entire legions of soldiers specialized for different methods of warfare. Their numbers are astronomical: In some Brazilian rain forests they make up an astonishing three-quarters of the insect biomass and more than one-quarter the biomass of all animals present. They talk via chemical signals we are just beginning to decipher, and their ways of living have deservedly inspired generations of fascinated scientists. </p><p>   Foremost in that group is Edward O. Wilson, emeritus professor of zoology at Harvard. (Personal disclosure: When I was in the springtime of my own training as an evolutionary biologist, Mr. Wilson was one of my mentors. But even had I never known him, my admiration would be no less.) In his latest book, \"Tales From the Ant World\" (Liveright, 240 pages, $26.95), Mr. Wilson weaves his own life story into that of these remarkable creatures, and he makes a passionate case for the juxtaposition. Like us, ants are both social and ubiquitous: \"If Homo sapiens had not arisen as an accidental primate species on the grasslands of Africa, and spread worldwide, visitors from other star systems, when they come . . . should be inclined to call Earth 'planet of the ants.'\" </p><p>   One trait humans and ants share is belligerence. \"Tales\" spends some fascinated time among the hornet-sized bull ants of Australia, a species better appreciated on the page than up close. They deliver \"shocking stings\" and have \"large eyes and an enduring lack of tolerance for animals the size of humans. Sentries on the nest surface turn and watch as you approach . . . they will start to walk toward you, and it will be a mistake to linger.\" </p><p>   Not all ants are so aggressive, but their abundance and diversity verges on the fantastic. Mr. Wilson introduces a science-fiction-worthy array of creatures including \"species that walk under water to harvest the bodies of drowned insects; other, arboreal forms that glide on body flanges, like flying squirrels . . . still others, huntresses with trapjaws that slam shut in the fastest animal movement ever recorded.\" Others boast intricate and lurid group practices: \"colonies that enslave captives of other colonies; suicidal soldiers that explode their own bodies by violent abdominal contractions; social parasitic queens that ride on the backs of host queens; colonies that unite to form continuous supercolonies that extend for tens of kilometers\" -- and more. </p><p>   If this catalog has whetted your appetite for formicine variety, you could also delve into \"Empire of Ants: The Hidden Worlds and Extraordinary Lives of Earth's Tiny Conquerors\" (The Experiment, 352 pages, $27.95), coauthored by biologist Susanne Foitzik and science journalist and biophysicist Olaf Fritsche. Beautifully illustrated with color photographs, the book offers a view into parallels between seemingly out-of-this-world ant societies and our own, including cities, an intense work ethic, division of labor, intragroup cooperation combined with genocidal outgroup warfare, even a kind of to-the-death national loyalty. The authors' scientific rigor is matched by their joy in their subjects. </p><p>   The world's insects, alas, have been experiencing a potentially catastrophic decline; our springs threaten to be more silent than ever before. But at least one noisy and widespread event is in store for the eastern U.S. this spring: the emergence of Brood X, consisting of billions of 17-year cicadas, sporting shiny black bodies, fire-engine-red eyes and translucent wings with orange veins. You won't want to miss them . . . and depending on where you live, it's possible you won't be able to. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Barash is professor of psychology emeritus at the University of Washington. His most recent book is \"Threats: Intimidation and Its Discontents.\" </p><p></p>",
