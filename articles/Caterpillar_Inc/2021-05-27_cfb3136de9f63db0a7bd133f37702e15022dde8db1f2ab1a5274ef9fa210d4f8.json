Warner of Virginia, a courtly figure and longtime military expert whose marriage to Elizabeth Taylor gave him a dash of star power, has died at age 94. </p><p>\n  Mr. Warner died Tuesday of heart failure at home in Alexandria, his longtime chief of staff, Susan A. Magill, said Wednesday. </p><p>\n  A centrist Republican, Mr. Warner had an independent streak that sometimes angered more conservative GOP leaders, but he was hugely popular with Virginia voters. </p><p>\n  Mr. Warner was the sixth of Ms. Taylor's seven husbands. The two were married in 1976 and divorced in 1982. Ms. Taylor wrote later that they remained friends, but she \"just couldn't bear the intense loneliness\" when he became engrossed in his Senate duties. He served five terms before retiring. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MICHIGAN </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Man Is Exonerated, </p><p>\n  Freed After 32 Years </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A man was exonerated Wednesday after 32 years in prison when authorities agreed that he was wrongly convicted of a fatal stabbing in suburban Detroit based on faulty evidence, including a bite mark on the victim. </p><p>\n  For years, Gilbert Poole Jr. had challenged his first-degree murder conviction with expertise from the Innocence Project at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. </p><p>\n  An Oakland County judge dismissed the conviction at the request of the Michigan attorney general's office, clearing the way a few hours later for Mr. Poole's release from a prison in Jackson. </p><p>\n  Mr. Poole was convicted in the fatal stabbing of Robert Mejia, whose body was found in a Pontiac field. Mr. Poole repeatedly denied any role. </p><p>\n  Attorney General Dana Nessel said the county prosecutor's office, which handled the case in 1988-89, had no objection to vacating Mr. Poole's conviction. </p><p>\n  \"We are thrilled that the truth has finally been established,\" said Mr. Poole's lawyer, Marla Mitchell-Cichon of the Innocence Project, </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OBITUARY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Children's Author </p><p>\n  Eric Carle Dies at 91 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Eric Carle, the beloved children's author and illustrator whose classic \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" and other works gave millions of kids some of their earliest and most cherished literary memories, has died at age 91. </p><p>\n  Carle's family said he died Sunday at his summer studio in Northampton, Mass., with family members at his side. The family's announcement was issued by Penguin Young Readers. </p><p>\n  \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar,\" published in 1969, was welcomed by parents and delighted kids with its story of the metamorphosis of a green and red caterpillar to a multicolored butterfly. </p><p>\n  It has sold some 40 million copies and has been translated into 60 languages, spawned stuffed animal caterpillars and has been turned into a stage play. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  FLORIDA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Helicopter Crashes </p><p>\n  With Four Aboard </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A firefighting helicopter carrying four people on a training exercise crashed near an airport in central Florida.
