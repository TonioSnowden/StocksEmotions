An adorable wren may hop along and eat that poisoned caterpillar! </p> <p>And I am reminded of Blake's lines, “He who shall hurt the little wren/Shall never be beloved by Men”. </p> <p>Caterpillars become moths that pollinate. Generally in nature everything has a function. </p> <p><strong>Joanna Pallaris</strong> <br><em>London E9, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Remember everything in nature has a purpose' FT.com 15 April.
