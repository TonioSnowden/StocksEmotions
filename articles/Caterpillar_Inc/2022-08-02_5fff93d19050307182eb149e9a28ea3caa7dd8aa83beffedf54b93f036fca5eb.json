  "title": "Caterpillar Second-Quarter Sales Rise With Higher Prices for Machinery; Company says demand for construction and mining equipment remains strong, especially in North America",
  "text": "<p>The maker of heavy equipment said higher prices for equipment contributed $1.1 billion to an 11% increase in second-quarter sales from the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Shares in early-morning trading were 4% lower at $187.11.</p><p>Caterpillar said its manufacturing costs rose by $966 million from a year earlier. The company's operating margin was down slightly in the period, to 13.6% from 13.9% a year ago.</p><p>In June, Caterpillar said it would move its headquarters to Irving, Texas, from Deerfield, Ill., joining some other major U.S. companies weighing hiring and other costs in relocating their headquarters. Caterpillar said the company wasn't getting economic or tax incentives to relocate to Texas.</p><p>Sales of its construction equipment overall rose 7% during the quarter, despite a 17% drop in sales in the Asia-Pacific region and a 7% decline in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>The company said lower construction-equipment sales from Asia stemmed from weaker demand in China. Industry analysts have said continuing lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19 have damped demand in China.</p><p>For the three months ended June 30, Caterpillar reported a profit of $1.67 billion, or $3.13 a share, up from $1.41 billion, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time costs, adjusted second-quarter earnings were $3.18 a share, above analyst expectations of $3.01. The company's overall revenue of $14.25 billion was slightly below expectations.</p><p>Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com and Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>Caterpillar Second-Quarter Sales Rise With Higher Prices for Machinery</p>",
