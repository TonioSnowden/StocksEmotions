  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 141 points, or 0.4%, to 33,443.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX waas up 31 points, or 0.8%, at 4,215.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 108 points, or 0.9%, to 12,597.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62 points, or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite failed to hold a bounce, ending the day with a loss of less than 0.1%.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is down 6.8% for April, heading for its biggest monthly decline since March 2020. The Nasdaq Composite has lost nearly 11% since the start of April and is on pace for its worst monthly performance since October 2008. The Dow has lost about 4% so far in April.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The results from Meta Platforms FB weren't well ahead of consensus, as revenue actually came in weaker than forecast, but expectations were low given the 48% decline this year in the stock. Shares jumped 15%.</p><p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the Meta results weren't great, but weren't horrible either.</p><p>Meta's better-than-forecast subscriber numbers sets the stage for two other megacap tech stock results due after the close Thursday, Amazon.com AMZN and Apple AAPL. Though the stock-market decline for Amazon hasn't been as severe as Meta's, its stock is just 2% above its 52-week intraday low.</p><p>In U.S. data Thursday investors were also weighing a first look at first-quarter economic growth, with gross domestic product showing a 1.4% annualized contraction after a 6.9% expansion in the final quarter of 2021. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 1% growth, but some had warned of the potential for a negative number.</p><p>As economists had warned, the decline was mostly due to a record international trade deficit, lower government spending and declining inventories, but robust consumer spending and businesses investment signaled the economy was still expanding at a steady pace.</p><p>Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliance, said the data should still serve as a warning to investors.</p><p>\"With the Fed beginning to aggressively raise interest rates, stock and bond markets have already been rattled. They've regained their footing and there is a lot to be optimistic about in terms of corporate earnings growth, corporate balance sheets and a resilient consumer, but all of that can change quickly, so it's important to be prepared for a wider range of outcomes over the next 1-2 years,\" he said, in emailed comments.</p><p>The yen USDJPYmeanwhile slumped to a fresh 20-decade low after the Bank of Japan didn't alter its easy monetary policy stance.</p><p>See: Dollar domination continues, as yen slumps to two-decade low</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Teladoc Health Inc.
