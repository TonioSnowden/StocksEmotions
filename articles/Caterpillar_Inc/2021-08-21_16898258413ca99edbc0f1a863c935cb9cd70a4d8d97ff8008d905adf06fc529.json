Thus does a young Vietnamese boy venture to class in \"My First Day\" (Make Me a World, 38 pages, $17.99), a picture book written and illustrated by Phung Nguyen Quang and Huynh Kim Lien.</p><p>\"This is the first time I've made this trip on my own, weaving through floodwaters and forests,\" the boy tells us, as we see him setting off alone into the wide waterways of the Mekong Delta. In lush and sweeping illustrations, he pilots his way across curling water under pink early-morning skies and into unnerving olive-green darkness. \"The mangroves hide a thousand eyes, all looking at me,\" the boy explains, evoking the acute conspicuousness that children feel when starting school. This sumptuous picture book for children ages 3 to 7 affirms that, however differently children may get to class, jitters on the first day are universal.</p><p>A Brooklyn boy named Harry Bergen-Murphy is so angsty about starting first grade that he clings to the front door of his apartment building and vows not to go in \"Harry Versus the First 100 Days of School\" (Anne Schwartz, 206 pages, $17.99), by Emily Jenkins. With short, punchy chapters and droll full-color pictures by Pete Oswald, this is a lively, accessible read for children ages 5 to 8. The story takes Harry from the trepidation of day one to the excitement of day 100, when all the kids in his class bring show-and-tell examples of objects in amounts of 100 (marshmallows, tiny plastic animals, grains of rice). In between, readers will witness the making and breaking of friendships, along with jokes and teasing that go wrong, and receive a great deal of norm-establishing political catechesis. Along with tackling consonant blends and the silent \"e,\" Harry learns why \"change makers\" are renaming Columbus Day; why Thanksgiving has \"a sad history\" (a classmate's \"mothers will have a party with rainbow tablecloths and not call it Thanksgiving at all\"); and why, as another classmate says, \"it doesn't matter who you love, 'cause love is love.\"</p><p>Well, sure, maybe. These are not egregious statements, the world being as it is, but one can't help noticing that the didacticism so rife in children's books is always of the left-wing variety. Ms. Jenkins eschewed politics in her \"Toys\" series (2006's \"Toys Go Out,\" 2008's \"Toy Dance Party\" and 2011's \"Toys Come Home\"), and those wonderful books are all the better for it.</p><p>Kindness, courage and humor become a small girls' superpowers in \"Super Milly and the Super School Day\" (Nosy Crow, 32 pages $16.99), a picture book written by Stephanie Clarkson and illustrated by Gwen Millward. It is Superhero Day at school, and all the kids are coming as their heroic alter egos. So-called Incredible Iqbal wears a green outfit with a thunderbolt on the front. Fantastic Flora has a golden diadem. Super Milly herself sports a pair of her brother Joe's Y-front underpants, a tea-towel cape and a sticker with the letter \"M.\" But she lacks super skills: \"I don't have X-ray vision. I can't climb buildings,\" she laments. \"I can't even stop Joe from taking the last piece of toast.\" In bright digital illustrations, Milly's classmates run into difficulty during the day: William forgets his costume; Flora suffers from writer's block; Archie needs green paint. Milly solves one problem after another -- Bam! Kaboom! Zap! -- in this encouraging tale for 3- to 5-year-olds.</p><p>Learning to read and write can be daunting. April Jones Prince presents these related skills with a spirit of joyful adventure in a single-volume, two-part book that can be read from either end. \"You Are a Reader!\" (Margaret Ferguson, 40 pages, $18.99) takes children ages 6-8 through the satisfactions (and frustrations) of reading: \"Storybooks aren't quite your speed? So many other things to read! Labels, programs, comic books. A recipe that you can cook.\" We eventually arrive at a central page-spread, at which point children will need to flip the book in order to read a complementary rhyming paean, \"You Are a Writer!\" Christine Davenier's pictures here are, as ever, a treat: With lively lines and delicious dappled watercolors, they radiate coziness and good cheer.</p><p>The ragged hand-lettering in Renato Moriconi's \"The Very Hungry Plant\" (Eerdmans, 44 pages, $17.99) may present a challenge to fledgling readers, but since this amusing tall tale for children ages 3 to 7 is best shared, perhaps grown-ups can agree to take on the job of reading it out loud. Mr. Moriconi, a Brazilian writer and artist, draws on the tradition of cumulative absurdism -- think of stories such as \"There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly\" and \"A Balloon for a Blunderbuss\" -- in this account of a carnivorous plant. The plant begins as a skinny stalk of green with a wide, spiked maw, looking comically small as it eats a caterpillar, a butterfly and a spider. \"The plant grew, and so did its hunger,\" we read, as the plant and its diet expand. Soon the plant is a monster that devours passing airplanes, fleets of witches and even a choir of angels. Mr. Moriconi's illustrations are hilarious in their simplicity, especially when, after taking a rest from eating, the plant suffers an unexpected reversal of fortune.</p>",
