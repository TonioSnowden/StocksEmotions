  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Caterpillar Shares Push Dow Into Black  ---  Nasdaq, S&P 500 fall  as tech companies  report lackluster  quarterly results  ----  By Caitlin Ostroff and Gunjan Banerji",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks ended mixed after data showed the U.S. economy returned to growth in the third quarter and investors digested more earnings from big tech companies </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 194.17 points, or 0.6%, to 32033.28. A jump in Caterpillar shares helped push the blue-chip index to its fifth day of gains. It is up 5.6% over that period, its largest five-day gain since May. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500, meanwhile, fell 23.30 points, or 0.6%, to 3807.30. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 178.32 points, or 1.6%, to 10792.67. Both suffered their second straight day of losses. </p><p>   Stocks have swung lately, driven by continued uncertainty about the pace of interest rates and the latest batch of corporate earnings. </p><p>   On Thursday, the latest gross domestic product data showed that the U.S. economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter, a sign that the economy is stronger than many have feared. </p><p>   Still, investors are worried that lackluster results so far in technology companies' earnings could be a sign of a coming economic slowdown. This week, some of the biggest technology firms have reported financial results that disappointed investors. </p><p>   Facebook parent Meta Platforms posted its second revenue decline in a row after markets closed Wednesday. The social-media company is battling a host of challenges, including a tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition and the fallout from Apple's ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its advertising business. The shares plunged 25%, falling $31.88 to $97.94. It was one of the biggest one-day declines since the company went public about a decade ago. </p><p>   Some investors said they were bracing for bigger losses ahead for tech stocks after an already punishing year. </p><p>   \"I would be more skeptical of being tempted to own what might look cheap,\" said Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer and portfolio manager of global equity strategies at Ariel Investments, of Meta shares. \"It seems cheap, but it's an optical illusion.\" </p><p>   Google-parent Alphabet reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth this week, with its YouTube video platform posting a drop in advertising revenue for the first time since the company began reporting the unit's performance. The company's shares fell $2.71, or 2.9%, to $92.22, bringing losses for the week to 8.8%. </p><p>   \"Some of the tech earnings have been very disappointing,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. Advertising has historically been seen as a bellwether for how the economy is doing, he said, with the decline in that part of earnings \"suggesting the economy is slowing.\" </p><p>   The swings this year in big tech stocks have marked the end of an era for the group of companies dubbed the FAANG stocks. For years, they notched big, simultaneous gains. </p><p>   That trade has unraveled this year. The five FAANG stocks -- Facebook parent Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet -- have posted double-digit declines this year. </p><p>   \"We've seen these names trade like a block the past few years,\" said Jason Brady, chief executive officer of Thornburg Investment Management. \"We're starting to see both in the stock prices and results, some differentiation in their results.\" </p><p>   The volatility hasn't been limited to tech. Shopify jumped 17%. Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the conglomerate housing aerospace, materials and other businesses raised its full-year profit forecast. Caterpillar posted a big increase in third-quarter sales, with demand for its construction and other heavy equipment holding up even as it raised prices. Shares rose 7.7%. </p><p>   In economic news, data from the Commerce Department showed that the U.S. economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the third quarter, snapping two quarters of contraction. Durable-goods orders rose 0.4% in September from the previous month, and new figures showed that 217,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 22, up slightly from the week prior but still near historic lows. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.938% from 4.014% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely. </p><p>   In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.3% to trade at $96.96 a barrel. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down by less than 0.1%. </p><p>   Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.9%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.3%. </p><p></p>",
