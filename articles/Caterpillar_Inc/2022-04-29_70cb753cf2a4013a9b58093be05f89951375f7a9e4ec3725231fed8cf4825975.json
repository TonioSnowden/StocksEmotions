  "text": "<p>\n  STANLEY BLACK &amp; DECKER </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. shares fell 8.6% after the tool manufacturer cut its profit outlook for the year, primarily due to higher commodity and shipping costs. </p><p>\n  The company said that it expects costs for commodity and transportation to rise an extra $600 million this year. Its profit will also take a hit from the closure of its Russia business and the recent sale of a division. </p><p>\n  It is raising prices to soften some of the blow of the higher costs. </p><p>\n  \"Inflationary trends continued during the quarter and we are responding with additional pricing actions to be implemented in the coming weeks,\" Chief Financial Officer Donald Allan Jr. said. </p><p>\n  The company said that it expects per-share earnings of $7.20 to $8.30, compared to its prior view of between $10.10 to $10.70 a share. </p><p>\n  Shares are down more than 38% over the last 12 months. </p><p>\n  The lowered view came after the company posted a 20% jump in first-quarter sales compared to a year ago, helped by acquisitions and higher prices. </p><p>\n  -- Paul Ziobro </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  DOMINO'S </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Domino's Pizza Inc. said that its deliveries in the U.S. are suffering from insufficient staffing, shortened restaurant hours and unanswered customer phone calls. </p><p>\n  \"We have a lot of work to do to restore growth in that important channel,\" Chief Executive Richard Allison said during an investor call. </p><p>\n  The largest U.S. pizza company by sales said it is performing a full assessment of its delivery business to try and improve operations. Domino's is advertising job openings on television, something it hasn't done in the past, executives said. It will also route customer phone orders to call centers in situations when a store is too busy to pick up the phone, the company said. </p><p>\n  Domino's said it believes it can resolve its delivery challenges on its own but it is also exploring other options. The company doesn't work with app delivery companies, saying those outside services erode profit and connections with consumers. </p><p>\n  Shares of Domino's Pizza fell 7.5% to $344.89. </p><p>\n  -- Heather Haddon and Stephanie Lai </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MERCK, ELI LILLY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Pharmaceutical giants Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. both reported year-over-year sales growth, lifted by their respective Covid-19 treatments. </p><p>\n  Merck's sales jumped 50% to $15.9 billion for the first three months of the year, beating analysts' estimates for $14.62 billion. </p><p>\n  The company's sales got a $3.2 billion lift thanks to Merck's Covid antiviral treatment, called Lagevrio, also known as molnupiravir. It is the company's first quarter to fully reflect sales from the Covid treatment, which was authorized by U.S. regulators at the end of last year. </p><p>\n  Merck also raised its 2022 sales guidance to between $56.9 billion and $58.1 billion, including $5 billion to $5.5 billion from the company's Covid treatment. </p><p>\n  Shares of Merck rose 4.2% to $88.58. </p><p>\n  Similarly, Lilly saw quarterly sales of its Covid-19 treatment nearly double to $1.47 billion, helping drive a 15% increase in worldwide sales to $7.81 billion. </p><p>\n  The company also raised its full-year sales guidance by $1 billion to reflect the sale of 600,000 doses of the company's Covid treatment, bebtelovimab, to the U.S. government. </p><p>\n  Shares of Lilly rose 4.3% to $297.27. </p><p>\n  -- Will Feuer </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CATERPILLAR </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Caterpillar Inc. said strong construction activity in the U.S. drove demand for its backhoes and excavators, but it still struggles to get enough parts. </p><p>\n  The maker of heavy equipment has been unable to get enough components, like semiconductors, to build as many machines as its customers wanted, said Andrew Bonfield, chief financial officer. </p><p>\n  Caterpillar said demand for its machinery remains strong as the world economy emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, with revenue up 14% to $13.59 billion in the company's first quarter ended March 31. The company's order backlog continued to increase, rising by $3.4 billion during the quarter from the end of 2021. The backlog now totals more than 50% of Caterpillar's total sales last year. </p><p>\n  Caterpillar's costs are rising, too, and the company said its price hikes in its first quarter didn't offset rising prices for materials and other costs. Higher prices for Caterpillar's products added $704 million to operating profit, the company said, while higher manufacturing costs reduced it by $804 million. </p><p>\n  Caterpillar's shares fell 0.7% to $212.44. </p><p>\n  -- Austen Hufford </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  HERSHEY CO. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Hershey Co. raised its outlook for the year after posting double-digit percent growth in first-quarter sales and profit, as demand for its candy and snacks held up even with higher prices. </p><p>\n  The company sounded a note of caution, however, saying that growing inflationary pressure on consumers' wallets and fewer government benefits could dent buying power as the year goes on. </p><p>\n  The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups said that revenue rose 16%, as consumers continued to buy their items even as prices rose. Profit rose by a little more than a third. </p><p>\n  It raised its outlook for the year, now seeing both sales and adjusted earnings up 10% to 12% in anticipation of sustained consumer demand. That compared with a prior forecast for sales to grow by between 8% and 10% and adjusted earnings to rise between 9% and 11%. </p><p>\n  Hershey shares rose 2.6% on Thursday. </p><p>\n  -- Dean Seal </p><p></p>",
