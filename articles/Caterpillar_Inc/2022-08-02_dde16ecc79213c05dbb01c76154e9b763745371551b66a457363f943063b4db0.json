  "title": "U.S. Stocks End Lower on China Tensions, Fed Comments; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan stirs geopolitical worries; Treasury yields tick higher",
  "text": "<p>Mrs. Pelosi landed in Taiwan on Tuesday and was scheduled to meet later with Taiwanese officials, in the first visit by a House speaker to the democratically governed island since 1997. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, had warned Mrs. Pelosi not to go through with the trip. Chinese officials had threatened unspecified countermeasures should her visit proceed.</p><p>Asian stocks sold off. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite dropped 2.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.4%.</p><p>Mrs. Pelosi's visit came against a fragile backdrop for markets. The U.S. economy is struggling with the twin threats of soaring inflation and rapidly rising interest rates—part of the Fed's stated goal to fight rising prices even if it knocks economic growth.</p><p>Stocks have rebounded in recent weeks on hopes that the worst of inflation and rate rises could be over. But comments from a pair of Fed officials on Tuesday suggested that such enthusiasm might be premature.</p><p>San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview with CNBC that the Fed was \"nowhere near\" done increasing interest rates. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans expressed hope that the U.S. central bank could slow its pace of rate rises, but indicated that another 0.75-percentage-point hike in September \"could also be OK.\"</p><p>\"Even if you think the inflation dragon has been slain there is still a lot to worry about,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>\"There are still too many unknowns out there. Markets are going to be more volatile because of the more data-driven approach adopted by central banks, and valuations aren't so incredibly low that you'd say it is time to buy,\" he said.</p><p>Investors also were keeping a close eye on corporate earnings, which so far have largely performed better than feared.</p><p>Pinterest shares jumped more than 11% after activist investor Elliott Management confirmed it was the social-media company's biggest investor and Pinterest's new chief executive said he would focus on profitability.</p><p>Uber rallied 19% after its revenue more than doubled, signaling the ride-hailing company's efforts to trim its losses were working.</p><p>Caterpillar tumbled 5.9% after reporting sales figures that missed analysts' forecasts. JetBlue sank 6.4% after the airline reported a loss in the second quarter.</p><p>Cowen rose 8.4% after Toronto-Dominion Bank said it would buy the investment bank for more than $1 billion.</p><p>Government bond prices fell on Tuesday after jitters over Mrs. Pelosi's trip had earlier sent investors scurrying to assets considered havens. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.740% after sinking to 2.605% on Monday, its lowest level since April. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Earlier, bond markets flashed a warning sign as the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes briefly inverted for the first time since the start of the pandemic—an indicator that the Fed says has the best record of predicting a recession. The difference in the yields declined to minus 0.001 percentage point on Tuesday before edging back into positive territory, according to Tradeweb.</p><p>While Mrs. Pelosi's arrival in Taiwan didn't immediately provoke any strong responses from Beijing, it fueled worries that the already strained U.S.-China relationship could worsen, investors said.</p><p>An escalation of tensions could cause global investors to dump Chinese assets again just after many had been gradually warming to them following previous bouts of market turmoil, said Daryl Liew, head of portfolio management at REYL Singapore. \"This geopolitical event is putting a huge dent on that,\" he said.</p><p>In commodity markets, futures on benchmark Brent crude oil gained 0.5% to settle at $100.54 a barrel. Commodity prices from energy to metals have eased from their highs in recent weeks on fears of slowing global growth. That has added to hopes that inflation could soon peak.</p><p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.3%.</p><p>Shares of some Chinese national defense companies surged more than 15%, making them some of the best-performing stocks in the region. Shenzhen-listed Xi'an Tian He Defense Technology, a manufacturer of military equipment and smart security systems, jumped 20%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks End Lower on China Tensions, Fed Comments</p>",
