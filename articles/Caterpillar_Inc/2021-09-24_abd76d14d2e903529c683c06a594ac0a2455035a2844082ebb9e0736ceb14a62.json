  "text": "<p>   HAMPTON, S.C. -- A driver can park on the side of the road in this sprawling expanse of farmland, forest and swamp and not see another soul for hours. </p><p>   It was here on the Saturday afternoon of Labor Day weekend that the walls closed in on Alex Murdaugh. His wife, Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, Paul, had been shot and killed on June 7 in murders that remain unsolved. His father had died of cancer on June 10. </p><p>   Mr. Murdaugh, 53 years old, the scion of a local legal dynasty, was broke, addicted to opioids and had lost his job at the family firm. Hours earlier, his partners had accused him of stealing client money and forced him to resign. </p><p>   He already had been named as a defendant in a wrongful-death suit involving 19-year-old Mallory Beach, who was killed in a 2019 boat crash in which his son Paul had been criminally charged. The family's housekeeper had died in a trip-and-fall in 2018 at their home, leading to another wrongful-death suit filed against him by her sons. </p><p>   The dramatic events have made the Murdaugh saga fodder for tabloids and true-crime podcasts. Mr. Murdaugh is the former head of the state trial lawyers' association. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather had served as prosecutors for a five-county region for nearly a century in addition to running one of the state's dominant personal-injury firms. The Murdaughs have long been both feared and revered as highly connected power brokers. </p><p>   The unraveling of the Murdaugh legacy came slowly, then all at once. </p><p>   On Sept. 4, Mr. Murdaugh parked his late wife's black Mercedes-Benz SUV in the grass on the side of Old Salkehatchie Road, 7 miles from his family's hunting estate. </p><p>   For days afterward, Mr. Murdaugh's representatives repeated what he told them had happened -- that he was changing a tire when a man he didn't know drove by, turned around and tried to shoot and kill him. </p><p>   Mr. Murdaugh confessed to his involvement on Sept. 13, a week into his detox from opioids at a Georgia facility, his lawyers said. They were in the room when he called the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED, whose investigators had taken over the case because of conflicts of interest between local law enforcement agencies and the family. </p><p>   According to Dick Harpootlian, his lawyer, Mr. Murdaugh had called Curtis Edward Smith and asked him to follow him to the remote spot and kill him so his older son could benefit from a $10 million life insurance policy. Mr. Smith, a one-time client in a traffic case, shot at Mr. Murdaugh's head with one of Mr. Murdaugh's guns. Mr. Murdaugh sustained an entry-and-exit wound and a possible skull fracture, said Mr. Harpootlian. </p><p>   On Sept. 14, a SLED officer arrested Mr. Smith on charges including assisted suicide and insurance fraud, as well as drug-related charges for methamphetamine and marijuana that officers had found at his house on Sept. 7 while executing a search warrant. Mr. Smith didn't respond to requests for comment. According to a video of his Sept. 16 bond hearing, when advised of charges, he said that they were \"all crap.\" </p><p>   On Sept. 16, Mr. Murdaugh was charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and filing a false report. His lawyer, Mr. Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator and former solicitor who has worked with three generations of Murdaughs, told the judge that Mr. Murdaugh admitted it was wrong to stage his own death. \"He has a tremendous opioid addiction,\" Mr. Harpootlian said in court. \"The death of his wife and son have put him over the edge.\" </p><p>   SLED has since opened an investigation into the circumstances around the death of the Murdaughs' housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, as well as related insurance payments. </p><p>   Ms. Satterfield's two adult sons had filed a wrongful-death suit against Mr. Murdaugh. Last week they filed a new lawsuit in which they said Mr. Murdaugh had urged them to pursue the previous suit to generate an insurance settlement for medical and funeral bills. According to court filings, their lawyer in the first suit, Cory Fleming, was Mr. Murdaugh's friend and former college roommate. </p><p>   Mr. Harpootlian, who is representing Mr. Murdaugh on pending criminal charges, said the Satterfield lawsuit is a civil matter, though he noted, \"I don't know what his responsibility will be. He wasn't her lawyer.\" Mr. Fleming didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   SLED has also opened an investigation into Mr. Murdaugh's alleged embezzlement at the family firm, now known as Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth &amp; Detrick. There could be more than $10 million missing, according to people familiar with the firm. </p><p>   In the wake of his firing, Mr. Murdaugh released a written statement, saying, \"The murders of my wife and son have caused an incredibly difficult time in my life. I have made a lot of decisions that I truly regret.\" </p><p>   SLED Chief Mark Keel said agents would continue working to bring justice to anyone involved with any criminal act associated with the continuing investigations. \"The arrests in this case are only the first step in that process,\" he said in a written statement. </p><p>   \"It's a real Penny Dreadful,\" said Joe McCulloch, a Columbia lawyer who now represents Connor Cook, a passenger in the fatal 2019 boat wreck. \"The shoes drop on this caterpillar every single day.\" </p><p>   The name Murdaugh (pronounced MUR-dock), has been synonymous in the area with the law since 1910, when Alex Murdaugh's great-grandfather founded the family firm. </p><p>   In 1920, Randolph Murdaugh was the first elected solicitor for the state's 14th judicial circuit. The district is unusually large, and serving as district attorney while simultaneously running a dominant law firm is equally rare, with rivals and allies alike saying it gave the Murdaughs insight into everything from jury selection to what criminal cases might lead to civil action. </p><p>   The firm's two-story brick headquarters on Mulberry Street is still among the grandest buildings in Hampton, population 2,500. </p><p>   The Murdaughs became political heavyweights in an era when rural Democrats ruled the South. Candidates sought their blessing for offices at every level, including judicial candidates, who rely on legislators to appoint them to the bench. </p><p>   The family's dominance has waned slightly since 2005, when Republican Gov. Mark Sanford signed tort-reform legislation. It wiped out a venue loophole that allowed the firm to bring suit in Hampton County against virtually any company operating in the state. </p><p>   Randolph Murdaugh III stepped down as solicitor after 20 years, marking the end of the family's 87-year tenure in the role. </p><p>   Richard Alexander \"Alex\" Murdaugh, whose name is pronounced \"ELL-ick,\" married his college sweetheart, Maggie Branstetter, in 1993 and joined the family firm soon after graduating from USC law school in 1994. In a white house on Holly Street a few miles from downtown, the couple raised two sons, Richard Alexander Murdaugh Jr., known as Buster, born in 1996, and Paul in 1999. </p><p>   The boys were redheads and outdoorsmen. They hunted, played pool and rode go-karts frequently at Moselle, the 1,700-acre hunting property Alex Murdaugh amassed as a family retreat. </p><p>   On Feb. 2, 2018, Ms. Satterfield, the family's housekeeper for more than 20 years, fell down the stairs. In her obituary, the 57-year-old was remembered for her laughter and her love of kids, with Alex, Maggie and their children described as \"those she loved as her family.\" </p><p>   Around that time, Paul was cited for a half-dozen minor legal infractions over the course of roughly a year. An avid boater, he was cited by game wardens who police state waterways for possession of alcohol days after he graduated from high school. </p><p>   Paul was a criminology major at the University of South Carolina. He frequently came home on weekends to see Morgan Doughty, his on-and-off girlfriend, and to hang out with a group of friends, according to depositions. </p><p>   Ms. Doughty declined to comment through her lawyer. </p><p>   On the night of Feb. 23, 2019, Paul, Ms. Doughty and two other couples took the Murdaughs' 17-foot boat to an oyster roast. Paul bought beer and hard seltzer using his older brother's ID, according to receipts and court documents. </p><p>   After about four hours, according to court documents, the group left. Paul docked the boat at one point in downtown Beaufort, where he and his friend Mr. Cook had two rounds of liquor shots. </p><p>   Several passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. </p><p>   At 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, investigative reports say. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn't be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken to the hospital. </p><p>   Alex Murdaugh arrived at the hospital shortly after his son, accompanied by his father. Randolph Murdaugh III stayed with his grandson, who was shackled to the bed. </p><p>   \"He is drunk as Cooter Brown,\" Randolph Murdaugh III said, according to testimony by a security guard. Cooter Brown is a Southern trope for the town drunk. </p><p>   Alex Murdaugh went room to room, nurses said, according to court documents, attempting to talk with each young person. Ms. Doughty testified that she asked her nurse to keep Mr. Murdaugh out of her room and that she feared he was trying to make it look like Mr. Cook was driving. </p><p>   On March 3, a pair of brothers found Ms. Beach's body. Her parents filed a wrongful-death suit against several parties, including Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat, and Buster Murdaugh, whose ID was used to buy alcohol. </p><p>   SLED investigators brought charges against Paul in April 2019, including boating under the influence causing death. The criminal and civil court proceedings in the boat crash involved dozens of witnesses and nearly as many lawyers. </p><p></p>",
