  "text": "<p>Michael Emberley and Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick run a picture book along a single track of prose in \"I Can Make a Train Noise,\" a railway excursion for children ages 3-6 that unfolds through imaginative and sophisticated illustrations. The story begins when a young family enters a coffee shop that is situated beneath the arch of a railway track. The mother and father, with a baby boy and toddler girl, scan the shop for a place to sit. The tables are crowded, and, via speech and thought bubbles, we can see what's going on in people's minds. The little girl tugs at her mother's hand and, in a speech bubble of her own, says, \"I can make a train noise.\" On the next two pages, as her family settles at a table, she looks straight at the reader and repeats: \"I can make a train noise.\" With a sudden \"Now!\" the girl jumps out of her seat, leads her fellow patrons in a giant impromptu conga line and chants: \"I can make a train noise, I can make a train noise, I can make a train noise, now, now!\"</p><p>What to read this week https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-read-this-week-book-reviews-last-emperor-mexico-dying-citizen-correspondents-john-edgar-wideman-11636745919</p><p>A Hapsburg royal's Mexican reign, the women who reported on World War II, John Edgar Wideman's American tragedies, citizenship in crisis and more.</p><p>The rhythm of her words becomes the sound of a train as the coffee shop transforms into a chain of sleek red cars (and the patrons into its passengers) whooshing through a city. There are shades of Maurice Sendak's \"In the Night Kitchen\" here, as the train passes buildings shaped like colossal condiment bottles, salt-and-pepper shakers and even a cheese grater. Trundling along with the train, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, is the refrain: \"I can make a train noise, I can make a train noise, I can make a train noise.\" Reading this book out loud, it is impossible not to make a train noise—and that, for children, will be the joy of it.</p><p>Camille Babeau sneaks a bit of useful physics into the machine-packed pages of \"Vehicles &amp; Transportation,\" the latest in the \"Do You Know?\" series. The book has a Richard Scarry vibe, with its golden spine and colorful pictures organized by theme, except that all the tiny sailors, cyclists and drivers are humans rather than dapper, Scarry-style animals. Here children ages 5-8 will find a wealth of detail about familiar modes of transport (trains, trucks, construction vehicles) and those more exotic. There are two pages devoted to ships powered by wind, such as Chinese junks, caravels from the Age of Sail and modern trimarans. In the book's discussion of barges, a side panel explains the workings of locks, those \"gated sections in canals or rivers where water levels are changed to allow boats, ships, and other vessels to travel through them.\" There's other info from the realm of physics, too: how ballast tanks operate in submarines; how keels work; why caterpillar tracks are so effective on uneven surfaces. The pictures are the work of four illustrators—Benjamin Bécue, Mattia Cerato, Julie Mercier and Cristian Turdera—who have created a unified feel for this stylish survey of things that go.</p><p>Writer Sherri Duskey Rinker and illustrator AG Ford have combined their energies once again for a machine-oriented picture book full of sound effects and glowing colors in \"Construction Site: Road Crew, Coming Through!\" \"Six mighty friends are on their way to help with something BIG today,\" it begins as a phalanx of powerful machines rolls through the desert at dawn. Amid the rocks and dirt and cacti, the vehicles—which include a scraper, a grader, a water truck and a paver, all of them smiling—will be building a new highway. Each machine gets a solo, so that readers ages 2-5 can learn its purpose and function: For instance, with its weighty front tread, the compactor \"has the job he likes, / rolling, squishing, with his spikes. / His heavy wheels push down hard— / smashing, mashing, yard by yard.\"</p><p>Cheery animals operate an array of vehicles in \"Red Truck, Yellow Truck,\" a picture book for readers ages 3-7 with punchy rhymes by Michelle Robinson and comical pictures by Jez Tuya. This is one of those jolly read-alouds that will have children pointing to the pictures and chiming in. In one scene, traffic on a busy city street comes to a halt as garbage men (well, really they're dogs) throw big green bags into the mobile hopper. \"Stop, truck! Garbage truck. What a heap of muck, truck! Squeeze, truck! Crush, truck! Never in a rush, truck.\"</p><p>Parents don't always understand their children's mania for machines, let alone share it. In \"All of the Factors of Why I Love Tractors,\" written by Davina Bell, a little boy named Frankie McGee tries to explain why he unfailingly chooses the same library book. \"There are more than a million good books here to try!\" his mother expostulates, throwing up her arms. \"Why is yours always about tractors, Frank, WHY?\" Lively pictures by Jenny Lovlie allow readers ages 4-8 to revel in the \"many various, glorious\" attributes of tractors that Frankie adores. These include \"a rumbling engine, a pipe that spits smoke, / a rake if you're raking, a hoe that can poke.\"</p><p>Children's Books: On the Road to Fun</p>",
