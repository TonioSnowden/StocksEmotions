  "text": "<p>Good morning. We start today with rising tensions between China and the US surrounding the planned trip by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.</p> <p>The 82-year-old Democrat is expected to land in Taipei tonight and ahead of her arrival Chinese fighter jets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50f56242-2bd7-44c6-8878-a755ad1e3043\">have ratcheted up operations</a> close to the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.</p> <p>Military units across the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, which is in charge of the South China Sea and some Taiwan-related missions, have entered a status of high alert, according to military officials in two neighbouring countries.</p> <p>China also announced another series of war games in the South China Sea scheduled to last from this morning until Saturday night, following various drills last week.</p> <p>Beijing issued a strong warning to Washington ahead of Pelosi's trip to Asia that a stop-off in Taiwan, which China regards as sovereign territory, could provoke a military response. </p> <p>US secretary of state Antony Blinken yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a69c08-b327-4a4d-99ff-20f92a4437f3\">urged China to act responsibly</a> and “not to engage in any escalation” if the visit goes ahead.</p> <p>The US military has been preparing to protect Pelosi, who is flying on a US Air Force aircraft.</p> <p>Rising tension led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e012ec92-58e6-4e84-95a0-384d17514c0e\">falls on equity markets across the region</a> today. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell as much as 3.2 per cent while China's CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks dropped as much as 2.8 per cent.</p> <p>Pelosi, who has been a longtime critic of China, particularly over human rights abuses, is expected to meet Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen tomorrow. She will be the most senior US politician to visit Taiwan since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich went in 1997.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Instant Insight:</strong> Beijing could have dismissed Pelosi as a lame-duck Speaker and ally of an unpopular president engaged in a feeble act of grandstanding. Instead the Xi administration has imbued the visit with more importance than it deserves, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3450039a-0315-449d-890a-aff67f1a083c\">writes Tom Mitchell</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for all your replies to my question yesterday.

The ban will end a two-decades-long bridge that has ensured a steady flow of capital between the world's two largest superpowers.

Seven months later, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3010c881-f890-4e95-b397-49daceae4554\">the early contours of their new venture are starting to emerge</a> ahead of a planned launch in October.</p> <p><strong>England victory a commercial breakthrough for women's football </strong>When an event provokes a public response from the Queen, the prime minister and the Spice Girls, questions about relevance are quickly dispelled. While the main challenges for the game remain — generating commercial income, attracting spectators and giving more women and girls the opportunity to play — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c426ae0-b4b5-4fb0-993d-78fae0d4212c\">there are reasons to be hopeful</a>.</p> <p><strong>Madagascar's famine is an alarm bell for the planet </strong>The UN has called it the world's first climate-change-induced famine. Some experts contend it is a consequence of poverty and poor governance. For people in Madagascar's south, unaware of the international furore and desperate to survive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fa3596e-9c6a-4e49-871a-86c20e0d170c\">it is known as <em>kere</em> — the hunger</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ifeoma Ozoma: tech workers must be Silenced No More </strong>After suffering discrimination on the basis of gender and race, the former Google, Facebook and Pinterest employee-turned-whistleblower is on a mission to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a41ec7b-d43e-4fab-bfb3-30d82efed8a8\">end the abuse of non-disclosure agreements</a>. </p> <h1>Architecture</h1> <p>The first renderings of the new Saudi city of Neom were released last week.
