  "text": "<p>“Exquisite corpse” was the surrealists' favourite game. Players would continue a sentence or a drawing on a folded piece of paper, knowing nothing of what had come before. The final result might be a surreal masterpiece, a dreamy fragment or a total mess. Most of London's new developments happen to look as if they had been designed like this, but one small part <em>has</em> been designed like this. And it looks quite impressive.</p> <p>It seems a little presumptuous to christen this area “Design District” but that is what Knight Dragon, developer of the broader Greenwich Peninsula project, has done. It has snipped a small napkin of space from a vast tablecloth of development and towers, most of which remain to be built, and dedicated it to the creative industries. It's an unusual approach: the most successful design districts tend to be adapted from existing neighbourhoods, often from buildings abandoned by other industries.</p> <p>Here, the Hong Kong-backed developer has pre-determined the fate of this little bit of the city and engineered its future through more affordable rents to attract creative businesses, subsidised by other rents across its developments.</p> <p>We know it's a design district because it says so in huge letters on top of a jolly and rather retro-looking red brick and glass building designed by architect David Kohn. The letters look like those signs left over from the days of pre-digital advertising, probably for some product that no longer exists.</p> <p>Sixteen new buildings from eight architects make up the neighbourhood, arranged around four small courtyards and a central square. It is permeable from every side, open to the public at all times of day. At one end sits a yellow caterpillar of a building, squirming its way around the square. It is a remarkable-looking thing with a bouncily childish aesthetic. This is the food hall, designed by Spanish architects SelgasCano. Completely transparent, with a banana-yellow frame, gull-wing doors, an opening roof and plenty of trees inside, it aims to achieve the elusive inside-outness beloved of architects. It recalls the fantasies of the Pop and High-tech architects of the late 1960s and '70s that never quite seemed to work in real life. Perhaps this will. Although, in the renderings and models, it also looks unsettlingly like an unravelled dayglo condom from a pub vending machine.</p> <p>The buildings are designed with workshop spaces on the ground floors and studios and offices above. How much production will go on here is debatable, but it makes a good story. They are all very different, and some are deeply enjoyable. Two buildings by architects 6a are chamfered back to allow a little more light down to ground level and are clad in a harlequin diamond pattern, expressed in a meaty pink and grey terrazzo with oversized windows on the sides. They are surprising and pleasing, inspired, says 6a founder Tom Emerson, by Richard Artschwager's Formica-clad sculptures.</p> <p>They also contain a little nod to late-British modernism and it's clear that the architects were working on these designs in tandem with their MK Gallery in Milton Keynes, with its oversized circular window and shiny metal. Those diamond openings also make for dramatic interiors (whose blockwork and cheap plasterboard have been left raw and exposed in the vein of early Frank Gehry) and a compelling double-height top floor with an expressionist sharpness.</p> <p>Two buildings by Italian-Spanish practice Barozzi Veiga bring a flash of shiny continental modernism to the site with their aluminium-clad facades. One of these buildings is being occupied by design school Ravensbourne Institute for Creativity and Technology. This will act as an annexe to its building beside the O2 Arena, a design school with no workshops.</p> <p>A wobbly-walled white building designed by HNNA contains the site's co-working space and club (the latter beautifully fitted out by architect Roz Barr). One building by Architecture 00 brings a touch of Berlin to the site in its open concrete frame and loose-fit interiors. A sculptural public stair thrust into the street invites people up through the terraces. The whole thing is wrapped in wire mesh that stretches right across the top of the building beneath (an open-air basketball court). Very urban. It looks a fine building. Their other structure is still under construction and looks enigmatic.</p> <p>Two metal-clad buildings by Mole Architects define one edge of the site, one in a rusty corten steel, the other painted in an iridescent dichroic finish. The other side is made of two buildings by Kohn, which form a kind of robust brick gateway to the bus station opposite and the swaths of as-yet undeveloped but soon to be overdeveloped land. Kohn has clearly had fun. With chunky brick columns, a green trellis of a facade and glass etched into block patterns, it plays with reality and representation, with scale and style. There are obvious references to James Stirling's Clore Gallery at Tate Britain, Aldo Rossi's later work and Venturi and Scott-Brown's celebration of the sign and the building as sign in those huge letters on top.</p> <p>The attempt here to make a dense, urbane and self-consciously designed quarter seems to be working. The buildings appear radically different but seem to get along well enough, albeit with a slight sense of an architectural petting zoo. The problem is more likely to be the surroundings. One hundred and forty-seven acres and £8.4bn of investment are going to need a return and the little design district will be hemmed in on three sides by towers of 40 storeys or so.</p> <p>The neighbourhood still feels strange with the Millennium Dome (now the O2 Arena) intended as a temporary structure to kickstart the North Greenwich redevelopment, now oddly entrenched as a local landmark. It leaves undefined spaces all around, one filled in by Ravensbourne, another by Diller Scofidio + Renfro's uncomfortable echo of their New York High Line, the “Tide”. This latter creates obsolete infrastructure rather than repurposes it.</p> <p>The question is whether this designated design district is intended as a standalone bauble or a tool to carve out a larger creative neighbourhood. If it is to be the latter, then the surrounding buildings are going to need similar attention and intensity, which looks unlikely. But an island is better than nothing. This is a rare example of a developer using architecture to create interest rather than as a rain screen for a generic investment product. It is an approach common in France and Spain but it looks fresh here. Perhaps its influence will spread outwards.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.designdistrict.co.uk/\"><em>designdistrict.co.uk</em></a></p><p>Source: Edwin Heathcote 2021 'London's new Design District offers first-rate architectural pick 'n' mix' FT.com 8 September.
