  "title": "Chinese Machine Giants Prosper in Pandemic  ----  By Xie Yu",
  "text": "<p>   China's machinery giants have built up some serious stock-market gains. </p><p>   Companies such as Sany Heavy Industry Co. and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &amp; Technology Co. make the excavators, dump trucks and cranes that keep China's countless construction sites humming. </p><p>   These big players have prospered during the pandemic, as China's property industry resumed building after some interruptions in early 2020. Meanwhile, Covid-19-related disruptions helped them to gain ground on foreign rivals like Caterpillar Inc. and Japan's Komatsu Ltd. Exports have also started to recover sharply. </p><p>   Sany Heavy's stock in Shanghai has hit records, and as of Monday was up 171% over the past year, giving it a market value of more than $56 billion. Zoomlion's Hong Kong shares recently hit highs last reached in 2013, and as of Friday the machinery subindex of China's CSI 300 gauge was up 22% over the past month. </p><p>   While China's leaders have been seeking to cut the country's reliance on debt-fueled investment, it has proved hard to reduce spending on property and infrastructure, particularly during times of economic stress. Analysts and investors expect the larger homegrown machinery companies to keep expanding domestic market share, while benefiting from robust customer demand to replace old equipment. In addition, many governments globally are counting on infrastructure spending to help their economies bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic, raising expectations for future international sales. </p><p>   Companies like Sany Heavy and Zoomlion have improved product quality and after-sales service in recent years, said Fiona Liang, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets. That competitiveness was \"sharpened during the pandemic, when foreign rivals were struggling to meet demand in the Chinese market, as their production was disrupted,\" Ms. Liang said. </p><p>   Data from China International Capital Corp., an investment bank, shows Chinese players have steadily expanded over the past few years in products such as excavators, at the expense of foreign rivals. Sany Heavy gained further market share in excavators last year, while Caterpillar and Komatsu both retreated, CICC figures show. </p><p>   For all of 2020, property investment in China rose 7%, while fixed-asset investment in power and utilities, a major source of infrastructure demand, jumped 18%, official Chinese statistics show. Overall investment in fixed assets rose 2.9% for 2020. Unit sales of excavators rose 39%. </p><p>    Kong Lingxin, an analyst with CICC, expects demand for excavators, cranes and other construction equipment to remain robust through at least 2023. While China might reduce spending on traditional infrastructure projects, that would be partly offset by customers replacing older machinery with new equipment -- either for better performance or to meet stricter environmental standards -- and as more human labor is replaced by machines, Mr. Kong said. </p><p>   His team estimates domestic excavator sales will rise an additional 10% in 2021, while exports will grow by 40% to 50%, as governments overseas spend aggressively on infrastructure to counter the pandemic. CICC is similarly bullish on cranes and concrete-pump trucks. </p><p>   Some market watchers say that machinery companies have started to benefit from a broader rotation away from expensive, fast-growing stocks and into less-popular sectors that are more exposed to economic cycles -- a switch in investor preferences that likely has further to run. </p><p>   \"The valuation gap between old-economy, or unloved, names and very loved names is just getting very hard to explain,\" said Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity International. </p><p>   Some investors are looking at opportunities as larger swaths of the real economy come back online, said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors LLC. \"In China, that means profit-taking from more favored sectors and money rolling into more traditional sectors like industrials, energy and materials,\" he said. </p><p>   Even after the run-up, the Chinese machinery companies have comparatively modest valuations. </p><p>   As of Friday, Sany Heavy's Shanghai shares and Zoomlion's Hong Kong-listed stock traded at prices of roughly 19 and nine times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, respectively, according to FactSet. Caterpillar and Komatsu both trade on ratios of more than 20 times. </p><p>   On Thursday, Zoomlion said net profit for 2020 could rise by 60% to 72% to as much as 4.3 billion yuan, the equivalent of $665 million. It said demand tied to infrastructure projects in China had been robust, as had customer demand for upgrading or replacing equipment. </p><p>   Zoomlion said newer product lines, particularly in farming equipment, had also lifted revenue and profit. </p><p></p>",
