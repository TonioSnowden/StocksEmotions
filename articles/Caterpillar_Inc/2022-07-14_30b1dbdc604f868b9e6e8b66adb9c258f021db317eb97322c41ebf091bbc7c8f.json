  "text": "<p>   New York -- In a program note, Moses Pendleton, the \"Mo\" of Momix, the company of dancers he's directed since its beginnings in 1981, explains a little about his \"Alice,\" now playing at the Joyce Theater through July 24. He states that the 22-part production, which he conceived and directed in 2019, is a \"taking off point\" from his subject matter: Lewis Carroll's 1865 \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\" with \"Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There\" also providing inspiration. </p><p>   In a post-show chat on Thursday night, Mr. Pendleton spoke of his initial fascination with Carroll's subject by way of Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature, \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Sub-headed, \"Down the Rabbit Hole,\" Momix's \"Alice\" runs 85 minutes without intermission as it fills the stage with a marvelously dizzying flow of physical activities and illusions amid expansive, artful projections (video design by Woodrow F. Dick III, lighting by Michael Korsch, costume design by Phoebe Katzin). </p><p>   Noting that he shares Carroll's \"passion for photography and his proclivity for puns,\" Mr. Pendleton offers such segment titles as \"The Tweedles,\" \"Cracked Mirrors\" and \"Looking Through Stained Glass.\" Mr. Pendleton's music collage, with editing by Andrew Hanson, provides a colorful and rhythmic array of sonic accompaniment to the sections's dancerly activities. </p><p>   Carroll's title character is variously embodied by all five Momix women, barefoot in delicate, white chemises, with their hair hanging loose. Initially, Jade Primicias is seen in \"A Summer Day\" as she's positioned on a teeter-totter-like ladder suspended horizontally on wires and counterbalanced and guided by Colton Wall, her avuncular companion. </p><p>   Scene upon scene follows as the group's eight dancers play expertly acrobatic parts. \"A Trip of Rabbits\" is performed by an octet of rabbit-masked, nude-looking men and women, who cluster and gambol to alternately eerie and amusing effect. </p><p>   Mr. Pendleton's \"Tweedles,\" expands Carroll's Tweedledum and Tweedledee into a quartet discombobulatingly fixed with flat, outsize, baby-face masks. Two have sweet expressions and two sour as they appear to stare out as us, sometimes with the front-facing visages at odds with the angle of the dancers' side-facing bodies, all playfully witty and surreal. </p><p>   The graphically rich and striking projections come and go to frame the performers with deft, cinematic fluidity, as one scene gets wiped away for another by keenly timed moves of curtains that capture projected images. For \"Advice From a Blue Caterpillar\" the stage is dramatically deepened by video effects. </p><p>   The \"Blue Caterpillar\" itself is a snaking lineup of large, blue, air-filled balls, which eventually separate to be manipulated and bounced by the troupe in unison or in counterpoint to giddy effect. As multiple reflections of the balls fill the background, the effect recalls a fun-house mirror crossed with a kaleidoscope. </p><p>   For \"The Lobster Quadrille,\" four women spin and parade, initially appearing, thanks to their hoop-skirt, crinoline-styled costumes, as if animated lampshades. Eventually, these outfits get rearranged, next appearing as runway fashions, then oyster shells, and again as voluminous millinery. </p><p>   Eventually for \"Cracked Mirrors,\" silvery lighting and projection effects radiate from the stage, setting the scene for a mesmerizing display. Here four dancers manipulate Mylar and aluminum panels that allow them to play with reflections of themselves, which magically appear, hover and float. </p><p>   In serene contrast, \"There Is Another Shore\" follows. In it, four women lounge by the sea, the beach umbrellas they toy with catching the light and bathing the whole scene in a mother-of-pearl aura. \"Into the Woods\" supplants the seaside with a view of gnarled trees in front of which two couples knot and clamber through moves that release their limbs like branches, echoing those seen in the forest behind them. </p><p>   It seems natural that Mr. Pendleton's \"Alice\" would include Grace Wing Slick's familiar song \"White Rabbit,\" which lends a lyric to the title of the choreographer's closing episode, \"Go Ask Alice.\" This has one of his five Alices, Seah Hagan, rising above the stage a good \"10 feet tall\" (to quote the song), reminiscent of a column of vapor in her now lengthened, shimmering chemise. </p><p>   Mr. Pendleton's chat averred that his \"Alice\" remains a work-in-progress, and at least one segment, \"The Wolf-Spied Her,\" featuring Michael Curry's impressive, fleecy white daddy long-legs puppet, feels perfunctory. But that's an isolated incident in a show that takes viewers down Carroll's famous rabbit hole, and guides them out and through a visual world stocked with some of the fanciful sights found in Alice's enduring wonderland. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Greskovic writes about dance for the Journal. </p><p></p>",
