Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, has threatened \"serious consequences\" if Pelosi's visit goes ahead as planned.</p><p>\"The events schedule is dominated by one question: will U.S. House Speaker Pelosi arrive in Taiwan today as has been flagged, and how will China respond?\" wrote Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International, in a note.</p><p>Pelosi would be the highest ranking elected U.S. official to visit the island in 25 years and comes as part of a swing taking the speaker to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan for talks on a variety of topics, including trade, COVID-19, climate change and security.</p><p>\"The U.S. and Taiwan have colluded to make provocations first, and China has only been compelled to act out of self-defense,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.</p><p>Read: Pelosi leaves Malaysia, tensions rise over Taiwan visit</p><p>The White House on Monday criticized Beijing's response, saying the U.S. \"will not take the bait or engage in saber-rattling\" and has no interest in increasing tensions with China.</p><p>\"The most likely outcome is that Pelosi visits Taiwan, there's some show of force by the Chinese military (like crossing the midpoint of the Taiwan Strait), escalated rhetoric, but no actual conflict,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note.</p><p>\"This outcome won't derail the rally (as it's being driven by Fed anticipation). But this is a market that does not need additional headwinds, and escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China will only serve as an additional headwind on stocks—something that won't reverse the rally but could pile on if the outlook turns less rosy,\" he wrote.</p><p>The tensions sparked demand for safe-haven assets, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y down more than 5 basis points at 2.556%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>U.S. stocks rose sharply in July, bouncing back from 2022 lows set in June.
