  "title": "Business News:  Construction Boosts Caterpillar's Earnings  ----  By Austen Hufford",
  "text": "<p>   Caterpillar Inc.'s quarterly profit more than doubled as construction and industrial equipment customers placed new orders in a growing global economy, though supply-chain problems held user sales below the company's expectations. </p><p>   The company flagged higher manufacturing costs, especially increased shipping rates, and said it was continuing to face supply-chain challenges. </p><p>   \"The good news is that demand remains strong,\" said Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar's chief financial officer. \"The challenge for us was around supply,\" he said. </p><p>   Caterpillar's sales to equipment users grew 14% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, below its expectations of at least 15%, driven by constraints to the company's supply chain, Mr. Bonfield said. </p><p>   \"When the chain starts getting as stretched as it is, it doesn't take a lot for one or two things to put you in a situation where you have to change production schedules,\" he said. </p><p>   Caterpillar's shares rose 4% Thursday. </p><p>   Caterpillar and other manufacturers are dealing with congestion at ports, higher trucking and airfreight costs and difficulties finding many types of parts, including computer chips. </p><p>   Manufacturing executives have said the problems are driven by strong orders of goods across the board, stretching the industry's ability to produce enough to fulfill the demand. </p><p>   The Deerfield, Ill.-based maker of mining trucks and construction bulldozers said revenue grew 25% to $12.4 billion in its third quarter, driven by higher prices and volumes. </p><p>   The company earned a profit of $2.60 a share, compared with $1.22 a share a year earlier. Total profit was $1.43 billion, up from $668 million. </p><p>   On an adjusted basis, Caterpillar's profit was $2.66 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.31 a share. </p><p>   Higher manufacturing costs offset price increases Caterpillar implemented for customers. Higher prices added $256 million to operating profit while higher manufacturing costs reduced it by $267 million, the company said. </p><p>   Construction sales climbed 30% to $5.26 billion while mining sales grew by 32% to $2.41 billion. The company's energy-and-transportation sales rose 22% to $5.08 billion. </p><p></p>",
