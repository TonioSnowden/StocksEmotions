  "text": "<p>The pandemic has changed the geography of the American economy.</p><p>By many measures, red states—those that lean Republican—have recovered faster economically than Democratic-leaning blue ones, with workers and employers moving from the coasts to the middle of the country and Florida.</p><p>Since February 2020, the month before the pandemic began, the share of all U.S. jobs located in red states has grown by more than half a percentage point, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Brookings Institution think tank. Red states have added 341,000 jobs over that time, while blue states were still short 1.3 million jobs as of May.</p><p>Several major companies have recently announced moves of their headquarters from blue to red states. Hedge-fund company Citadel said recently it would move its headquarters from Chicago to Miami, and Caterpillar Inc. plans to move from Illinois to Texas...</p><p>Forty-six million people moved to a different ZIP Code in the year through February 2022, the most in any 12-month period in records going back to 2010, according to a Moody's analysis of Equifax Inc. consumer-credit reports. The states that gained the most, led by Florida, Texas and North Carolina, are almost all red, as defined by the Cook Political Report based on how states voted in the past two presidential elections. The states that lost the most residents are almost all blue, led by California, New York and Illinois.</p><p>Speaking of California, one prominent Golden Stater seems to enjoy vacationing in a less-regulated, more tolerant environment. But he doesn't necessarily want to shout it from the rooftops.</p><p>\"Newsom finally reveals his whereabouts,\" says a Cal Matters headline about California's Democratic governor. Emily Hoeven reports:</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom is on vacation in Montana visiting family, I was the first to report Tuesday evening.</p><p>It was information that the governor's office appeared loath to disclose. Although the office said Friday the governor had left California to spend time with family, it did not until Tuesday answer questions about where he was or when specifically he would return, a noticeable difference from communication surrounding other recent out-of-state trips. (A spokesperson said Tuesday Newsom hasn't yet booked his return trip, but that he will return to California over the weekend and be back in the office on Monday.)</p><p>The governor's office didn't respond to a question about why that information wasn't initially shared. But one possible reason could be that Montana is among the 22 states to which California has banned state-funded and state-sponsored travel, citing policies it deems discriminatory to LGBTQ+ people.</p><p>Montana is also one of the states Newsom's office has called out for restricting abortion access.</p><p>The governor's office tells Cal Matters that the state government is not paying for the trip but Mr. Newsom may feel that his journey to Big Sky country doesn't allow him to signal enough leftist virtue. In his defense, it's getting increasingly hard to maintain virtue signal transmission when so many beautiful places in the country—populated by so many friendly fellow American citizens—are deemed deplorable by Mr. Newsom and other Golden State politicos. It's not enough to share the partisan politics of California's ruling class. Some of the states that California's government officially deplores are run by Democrats. But their governors still can't save millions of residents from California condemnation.</p><p>California pols keep adding states to the condemned list, and therefore keep whittling down the list of places they can visit without embarrassing themselves.</p><p>Last week Wes Venteicher reported in the Sacramento Bee:</p><p>California is banning state-funded travel to four states that passed laws this year prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in school sports according to their gender identities.</p><p>State agencies will no longer pay for travel to Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana or Utah, according to a Thursday announcement by California Attorney General Rob Bonta. The bans begin when each of the state laws takes effect, between July 1 and Sept. 28...</p><p>Other states have been banned after passing measures that designate which bathrooms transgender people can use, allow doctors to deny medical care on religious grounds and restrict LGBTQ rights in other ways...Bonta also cites an Arizona statute prohibiting doctors from providing gender-affirming treatment to minors.</p><p>If California pols want to boycott every state where people oppose, for example, gender reassignment surgeries on minors, then California could end up with a very long list of banned territories. And those territories may be home to a lot of former Californians.</p><p>How many such states will be quietly hosting Newsom family vacations?</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>It's Not Easy Being an Intolerant Californian</p>",
