  "title": "A Lifeline for Entrepreneurs Has Become a Financial Albatross for Some; Small businesses that lease equipment and then were hurt by the pandemic can find the years of lease payments a heavy burden",
  "text": "<p>The culprit is a provision in most lease and finance contracts that binds owners to make years of monthly payments, no matter what happens to their business and even if the equipment doesn't work or is returned. The industry calls it the \"hell or high water clause.\"</p><p>Nicole Carranza and her husband leased $59,000 worth of equipment for a restaurant they planned to open in La Habra, Calif., just before the pandemic. After it began, they couldn't finance additional equipment, so they dropped their plan and canceled the order.</p><p>Only one item had shipped. The vendor returned the money paid for the rest of the equipment to the leasing company, Pawnee Leasing Corp.</p><p>Pawnee told the Carranzas they still had a lease contract. It said that after a deduction for the returned funds, they owed it nearly $70,000 in payments that they would have made over the 55-month lease if they had received and kept the equipment.</p><p>The Carranzas in turn filed for personal bankruptcy, mainly due to debt to the leasing company, Ms. Carranza said. \"With the rest of the debt, we would have probably looked at something more like a debt restructuring,\" she said.</p><p>Pawnee declined to comment on a specific customer. \"We provided substantial support to very large number of our customers to help and provide them time to adjust their business operations to the new COVID-world,\" President Gary Souverein said in an email. Deferrals typically averaged one to three months, according to securities filings by Pawnee's parent, Toronto-based Chesswood Group Ltd.</p><p>Without addressing specifics, Mr. Souverein called Wall Street Journal descriptions of the Carranzas' lease matter and another one \"either insufficient, inaccurate or misleading and generally out of context.\"</p><p>Leasing equipment can be an attractive option for entrepreneurs and business owners who have limited cash, can't get bank financing or worry about purchasing equipment that might grow outdated. </p><p>Inside Limitless Powder Coating in Modesto, Calif., whose owner leased an oven he said wasn't workable for his business.

He added that an owner needs to be careful, because \"the fine print is often on the back in really minute lettering.\"</p><p>Equipment and vehicle leases totaled about $160 billion in outstanding balances in 2019, the newest available number, according to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The volume of leases and finance transactions under $250,000 increased by nearly 15% in 2021 from a year earlier after dipping slightly in 2020, according to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, an industry group. Many leasing and finance companies are arms of equipment makers such as Deere &amp; Co. and Caterpillar Inc. or of big banks.</p><p>Although federal and state laws provide an array of protections to individuals who borrow, such as required disclosure of borrowing costs, they generally don't extend these to small businesses. Unlike leases to individuals, those to small businesses don't have to spell out the total amount to be paid over the life of the lease or the value of the equipment being financed.</p><p>Leasing and finance companies are pretty careful to explain the terms of contracts, said Ralph Petta, chief executive of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association. It is in their interest to work with customers affected by the pandemic, he said, adding that the financial strains \"are not unique to equipment financing.\" </p><p>Paperwork for equipment leased by Limitless Powder Coating.

By September they had an average of just 4% of their portfolios in deferral, said the analysis, done by consultant Tom Ware.</p><p>Comparable figures for bank lending are hard to come by, but many small-business owners say their banks showed more flexibility, as federal bank regulators urged. Bank of America Corp., for one, deferred payments on 20% of small-business credit-card balances and 14% of other small-business loan balances.</p><p>Pattera Newsome said when he shut down his Denham Springs, La., landscaping and maintenance firm after revenue dried up in the pandemic, all of his lenders except an equipment finance company agreed to work with him by writing off some debt or deferring payments while he tried to restart his business. The company, Ascentium Capital, sued for payments for an ice vending machine and related hardware, plus interest, attorney's fees and other costs.</p><p>A court granted Ascentium a default judgment for more than $60,000 in 2021. A spokeswoman for Ascentium's parent company, Regions Financial Corp., declined to discuss a specific client but said: \"Ascentium Capital has a strong track record of working in support of clients if their business experiences financial difficulty.\"</p><p>The \"hell or high water\" provision that leaves customers responsible for all payments regardless of circumstances is based on the notion that the leasing company just provides financing and isn't making or selling equipment, said James Schallheim, a finance professor at the University of Utah. \"A lot of courts have upheld it even in situations where I would say it doesn't seem right,\" he said.</p><p>\"On the other hand,\" he said, the arrangement \"does allow for a lot of low-credit-type lessees to get a lease when they otherwise wouldn't be able to get financing.\"</p><p>Industry officials defend the provision on the grounds that companies assume significant risk when they buy equipment and lease it out, such as that the equipment loses value over time. </p><p>Bobby Clements at his shop in Modesto.

At the end of the day, the customer is obligated for the entire amount,\" said Tom Meredith, chief commercial officer of leasing company De Lage Landen Financial Services Inc. He said DLL, a subsidiary of the Netherlands' Rabobank, granted three-month extensions to many customers struggling during the pandemic and gave some a second deferral.</p><p>Bobby Clements, owner of Limitless Powder Coating in Modesto, Calif., said he is stuck with a lease on an oven convection system. The oven, for melting powder, is smaller than what he ordered, Mr. Clements said, and it lacks a burner, control box and other key components, making it unusable.</p><p>The lease contract he signed in October 2019 said he \"unconditionally and irrevocably\" guaranteed 60 months of payments and accepted the equipment as-is. If he missed a payment, the company had a right to all future payments plus other costs, the contract said.</p><p>Mr. Clements said he has made about two dozen payments to Financial Pacific Leasing Inc. but didn't make several. In February, he signed a contract addendum that increased his monthly payments by a little under $150 and required him to resume making them.</p><p>\"I am stuck in a Catch-22. If I don't do it, my credit gets ruined. If I do do it, I'm throwing money out the window,\" said Mr. Clements, who has filed a suit against the equipment provider in state court in Stanislaus County, Calif. An attorney for the provider, who has denied responsibility in court filings, declined to comment. </p><p>Limitless Powder Coating uses for storage a nonfunctional oven it leased.

Sky owner Kari Negri asked the vendor to take back the equipment, but it refused, she said.</p><p>The contract called for Sky to make 60 monthly lease payments of $336.40. \"We will still need to be paid whole,\" a GreatAmerica portfolio manager told Ms. Negri by email. </p><p>Kari Negri, owner of Sky Properties management firm in Los Angeles, faced a lawsuit in an Iowa court after a dispute with a leasing company over a leased telecommunications system she said was faulty. PHOTO: Alisha Jucevic for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The suit was one of more than 300 that the leasing company, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has filed in local Linn County since the start of the pandemic, according to court records. GreatAmerica CEO Stan Herkelman said if the firm sued in every jurisdiction where it has customers, that would be an added expense borne by customers who pay on time.</p><p>Support of leased equipment \"is driven by the equipment vendor,\" he said. \"That's why you find the hell or high water language in there.\"</p><p>GreatAmerica said it provided deferrals or extensions to 95% of customers who requested them. It thinks of itself as a pretty strong ally of small and medium sized businesses, Mr. Herkelman said.</p><p>Sky's Ms. Negri didn't fight the suit. \"To travel all that way, for a small company, the expense is really not worth it,\" she said.</p><p>Instead, she filed a claim of her own against the vendor of the equipment she said didn't work, then used a $5,000 small-claims-court award plus company funds to pay GreatAmerica's roughly $12,000 claim. </p><p>The telecom system leased by Sky Properties, which founder Kari Negri said doesn't work and is kept in storage at one of her properties.

A broker had arranged the transaction.</p><p>Share Your Thoughts</p><p>What has been your experience with leasing equipment? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The broker was Kingswood Leasing. Maura Bragg, an attorney with its parent company, TimePayment Corp., said it is standard for leasing companies to introduce themselves after a lease is signed. She said Ms. Carranza came across as a sophisticated business owner.</p><p>In late 2020, Pawnee offered to settle the debt for $29,000 if paid soon. \"We don't have that kind of financial capital,\" Ms. Carranza said. \"We put everything into the business. It was all gone.\"</p><p>Jim Oberman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ruth Simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com</p><p>A Lifeline for Entrepreneurs Has Become a Financial Albatross for Some</p>",
