  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Caterpillar Flags Signs Of Recovery --- Company forecasts stronger construction equipment sales in the current quarter",
  "text": "<p>Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar's financial chief, said that while a rebound in home construction was boosting purchases for some machinery, spending cuts by local and state governments were weighing on road construction.</p><p>\"People in an uncertain time are just not necessarily sanctioning new projects,\" Mr. Bonfield said.</p><p>The company didn't provide profit guidance for the year, citing the unpredictability of operating during the continuing pandemic.</p><p>Caterpillar said it would also end a longstanding practice of disclosing retail sales every month, and share them each quarter instead.</p><p>Still, Caterpillar said it sees signs of a turnaround. The company's order backlog increased in its fourth quarter compared with the previous three months and a year earlier, as dealers ordered new machines ahead of the traditionally busy spring season.</p><p>For the current first quarter, Caterpillar said it expects stronger sales of construction equipment in particular.</p><p>\"Customers are starting to feel a bit more confident,\" Mr. Bonfield said.</p><p>Caterpillar's shares edged down $1.50, or 0.8%, to $182.84 on Friday.</p><p>Lower demand for Caterpillar machinery in the latest quarter is a contrast to consumer-focused manufacturers, many of which have struggled to keep up with large orders from customers at home buying new boats and kitchen appliances.</p><p>The oil and gas industry remained a particularly weak market for Caterpillar. Lower energy prices have led to fewer developments of oil and gas projects. Caterpillar said it still sees potential in energy; its purchase of the oil and gas business of Weir Group PLC for $405 million is expected to be completed soon, the company said.</p><p>Caterpillar said its service and parts revenue fell to $16 billion in 2020, from $18 billion in 2019, showing how the pandemic is making it more difficult for companies to stick by preset strategies. The company has been trying to generate more recurring revenue from services tied to digitally enabled equipment.</p><p>The company's finance arm said that the share of customers who are late on payments rose to 3.5% at the end of 2020, up from 3.1% at the end of 2019.</p><p>In all, revenue in the fourth quarter fell 15% to $11.26 billion from the quarter a year before. Profit declined 29% to $780 million.</p>",
