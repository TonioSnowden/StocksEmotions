  "text": "<p>How stocks are trading</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 456 points, or 1.4%, to 32,296.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 12 points, or 0.3%, at 3,843.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP sank, falling 61 points, or 0.6%, to 10,911.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow eked out a tiny gain to extend its winning streak to four sessions, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2%. The Nasdaq Composite is up 6.3% from its 2022 closing low, which it hit on Oct. 14, but remains down 29.9% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks rose after third-quarter GDP came in 2.6% higher on an annual basis and above the 2.3% gain economists expected. Other data showed durable-goods orders rising 0.4% in September. The latest weekly initial jobless-claims data showed a 3,000 gain,to 217,000.</p><p>\"The GDP release this morning was a goldilocks number for risk assets. Top line growth was solid, though consumption decelerated, it was still positive, highlighting resiliency in the major driver of the US economy,\" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth.</p><p>\"GDP was also helped by a normalization of trade. The major bright spot however, was in prices. The GDP Price index slowed dramatically quarter over quarter and came in below expectations. This is another sign pointing to the likelihood that the worst of inflation may be behind us,\" he said.</p><p>Just ahead of that data, theEuropean Central Bank announced a widely expectedinterest-rate increase of 75 basis points, to 1.5%, as expected on Thursday. The dollar hovered around parity with the euro EURUSD.</p><p>Meanwhile, big gains by Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Honeywell International HON and other Dow components after a round of upbeat results helped fuel gains for the blue-chip gauge.</p><p>Don't miss: MarketWatch live markets coverage</p><p>But investors were also paying attention to the latest gloomy set of earnings in the technology sector.</p><p>Big Tech was supposed to be the place that provided investors with some safety during an economic slowdown, but traders have learned that the high valuations these companies were afforded have made them very vulnerable to any indication of cyclical difficulties.</p><p>Need to Know: Why the rout for big tech companies may just be getting started</p><p>After Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOG earnings disappointed late on Tuesday, Meta's META attempted transformation to a metaverse platform was not well received by the market. Shares in the company formerly known as Facebook dropped 23.8%, falling below $100.</p><p>Read: Analysts slash their ratings on Meta as costs balloon. 'The bad news is you suck, the good news is you can only get better.'</p><p>This has left investors nervously eyeing the earnings of Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, due after the closing bell.</p><p>Also read: Apple earnings: What do the iPhone production reports really mean?</p><p>\"Realization has dawned that the might of big tech is not immune to the slowdown. Hopes that resilience would burn brightly through this U.S. earnings season have dimmed,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>However, Mark Newton, technical strategist at Fundstrat, saw the positive in the latest market action. \"The important takeaway for all investors Wednesday focused on stock indices being able to rally sharply off the lows despite poor Tech earnings as rates followed through further to the downside,\" he wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>\"That's an important point … it shows us all that markets are focusing more on interest rate changes (and should eventually focus on declining inflation) more than negative earnings,\" Newton added.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4% after its meeting next week, but recent soft U.S. economic data have built hopes that the central bank may decelerate its pace of tightening thereafter — a perception that has helped the S&amp;P 500 index climb 7.1% through Wednesday off its 2022 low, set two weeks ago.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Shopify Technology Inc. SHOP rose 9% after the e-commerce company notched a smaller loss than anticipated and forecast that its operating-expense growth rate will fall sequentially in the current quarter.</p><p>* Comcast Corp. CMCSA shares rose 6.6% after the company added net new internet subscribers against what's been a tough recent backdrop for growth. The 10,000 net subscriber gain in its residential broadband business and 5,000 net gain in business broadband came after Comcast posted a net of no new internet subscribers in aggregate during the second quarter.</p><p>* Caterpillar shares rose more than 8% after the maker of construction and mining equipment topped estimates for the third quarter.</p><p>* Honeywell shares rose 4% after the conglomerate housing aerospace, materials, and other businesses raised its full-year profit forecast and highlighted that its backlog gives \"confidence\" in the demand roadmap despite challenging economic conditions.</p><p>* McDonald's Corp. MCD shares gained 2.5% after the fast-food giant and Dow component blew past estimates for the third quarter.</p><p>* Dow component Merck &amp; Co. MRK rose 2% after the drug giant reported third-quarter profit and sale that beat expectations and raised its full-year outlook,</p><p>* Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP fell 2.8% after the company's third-quarter earnings fell sharply from the year earlier as inflationary pressures weighed.</p><p>Barbara Kollmeyer contributed to this report.</p><p>Dow surges 400 points after GDP data, but tech stocks hit by Meta results ahead of Apple, Amazon earnings</p>",
