  "title": "COLA Doesn't Bring Much Refreshment",
  "text": "<p>First, a confession: When I accepted a job offer to be a staff accountant at Caterpillar in 1974, it wasn't because I loved yellow bulldozers or because the company was offering me $100 more a month than the big accounting firms were. I was swayed by a new benefit being granted to most employees, a promise to adjust salaries quarterly \"$2 a month for each full .03 points change in the Consumer Prices Index.\"</p><p>Even a rookie accountant like me could see that a cost-of-living adjustment, known by the acronym COLA, could be a sweet deal for employees. And sweet it was. No one had to work harder, smarter or longer, yet on the first of every March, June, September and December we all got significant raises. Some years the COLA dwarfed traditional pay increases for merit or improved productivity.</p><p>As inflation ramped up during the late '70s, generous benefits at Caterpillar caused a stir in York, Pa. Some pointed out that the company's forklift operators were making more than assistant principals at the local high school. For me these complaints fell on deaf ears -- I liked making more than my peers in public accounting.</p><p>Eventually, though, we realized the protection these raises provided was an illusion. As labor costs escalated, industrial companies like Caterpillar had to raise prices even faster, and ultimately we all lost. By 1981 the company's costs were totally out of control; the country had double-digit interest rates, and demand collapsed. Management acted out of desperation. COLAs were eliminated abruptly for salary and management employees, followed by pay cuts and a three-year salary freeze. Caterpillar reduced employment by 30,000 over three years. Even with these measures, the company still lost about $1 million a day until 1985. About a decade later, with inflation tamed by President Reagan and tougher bargaining by Caterpillar, cost-of-living adjustments were dropped from union agreements.</p><p>I hope the Biden administration is right that the current inflation will be short-lived, though I doubt it. Going along to get along can be expensive. If past is prologue and inflation persists, management and business leaders will need to oppose vigorously clever ruses that promise to blunt the effects of inflation. Even if customers show they are willing to pay more, companies should never cede the ability to control costs.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lane is a retired director of global governmental affairs at Caterpillar Inc.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
