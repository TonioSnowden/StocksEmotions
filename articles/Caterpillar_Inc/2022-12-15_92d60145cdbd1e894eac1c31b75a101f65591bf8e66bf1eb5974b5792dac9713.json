  "text": "<p>But shares of the streaming-media company were taking a tumble Thursday after a report indicated that Netflix NFLX wasn't off to a particularly great start with one of those key drivers. The company has returned money to advertisers after failing to meet viewership guarantees, according to a report from Digiday.</p><p>\"While it's still very early days for our ad supported tier, we're pleased with the successful launch and the member engagement on the Basic with Ads plan, as well as the eagerness of advertisers to partner at the outset,\" a Netflix spokesperson told MarketWatch.</p><p>The stock was off 9.0% in afternoon trading Thursday and on pace to log its largest single-day percentage decline since April 20, 2022, when it fell 35.12%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Read:Netflix, Workday, Costco, Caterpillar and more stocks that are Cowen's favorites for 2023</p><p>Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wasn't shocked by the Digiday report, especially since Netflix only launched the ad-supported service in early November.</p><p>\"We don't believe this should come as a surprise, as ad impressions delivered depend on the number of people viewing them, and Netflix with ads only got off the ground six weeks ago,\" he wrote. \"As we wrote in our Netflix upgrade in Sept, we believe the service will succeed by drawing users from higher ad-free tiers to this lower-price tier rather than adding new subscribers, but it could take a couple of years to build a large-enough user base to become a meaningful destination for advertisers.\"</p><p>Nollen has a neutral rating on shares of Netflix, which are off 52% so far in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has declined 16% over the same span.</p><p>Netflix shares sink amid report of sluggish start for ad tier, but one analyst says that's no surprise</p>",
