  "title": "Caterpillar's Profit Doubles on Construction Project Strength; Supply-chain disruptions weigh on growth, chief financial officer says",
  "text": "<p>\"The good news is that demand remains strong,\" said Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar's chief financial officer. \"The challenge for us was around supply,\" he said.</p><p>Caterpillar's sales to equipment users grew 14% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, below its expectations of at least 15%, driven by constraints to the company's supply chain, Mr. Bonfield said.</p><p>\"When the chain starts getting as stretched as it is, it doesn't take a lot for one or two things to put you in a situation where you have to change production schedules,\" he said.</p><p>Caterpillar's shares rose 1% in premarket trading.</p><p>Caterpillar and other manufacturers are dealing with congestion at ports, higher trucking and airfreight costs and difficulties finding many types of parts, including computer chips. Manufacturing executives have said the problems are driven by strong orders of goods across the board, stretching the industry's ability to produce enough to fulfill the demand.</p><p>The Deerfield, Ill.-based maker of mining trucks and construction bulldozers said revenue grew 25% to $12.4 billion in its third quarter, driven by higher prices and volumes.</p><p>The company earned a profit of $2.60 a share, compared with $1.22 a share a year earlier. Total profit was $1.43 billion, up from $668 million.</p><p>On an adjusted basis, Caterpillar's profit was $2.66 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.31 a share.</p><p>Higher manufacturing costs offset price increases Caterpillar implemented for customers. Higher prices added $256 million to operating profit while higher manufacturing costs reduced it by $267 million, the company said.</p><p>Construction sales climbed 30% to $5.26 billion while mining sales grew by 32% to $2.41 billion. The company's energy-and-transportation sales rose 22% to $5.08 billion.</p><p>Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com</p><p>Caterpillar's Profit Doubles on Construction Project Strength</p>",
