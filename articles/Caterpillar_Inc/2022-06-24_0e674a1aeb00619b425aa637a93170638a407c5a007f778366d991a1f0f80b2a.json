  "text": "<p>\"If people aren't safe here, they're not going to live here,\" Mr. Griffin told the Journal in April. \"I've had multiple colleagues mugged at gunpoint. I've had a colleague stabbed on the way to work. Countless issues of burglary. I mean, that's a really difficult backdrop with which to draw talent to your city from.\"</p><p>Meantime, Democrats in Springfield continue to threaten businesses and citizens with higher taxes, plus a referendum in November to enshrine collective-bargaining in the state Constitution that would also enshrine public-union rule.</p><p>It's no wonder so many companies and people are leaving, and mostly to low-tax states. Caterpillar last week announced it is relocating its corporate headquarters from Deerfield to Irving, Texas, which has no income tax. Boeing is moving its headquarters to Arlington, Va., from Chicago.</p><p>In 2020, $2.4 billion in net adjusted gross income moved to Florida from Illinois, about $298,000 per tax filer. Illinois has lost about 60,000 black residents in the last decade, while Florida has gained 280,000.</p><p>Mr. Griffin has spent tens of millions of his personal fortune trying to rescue Illinois from bad progressive governance. Maybe he figures it's time to cut his losses.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
