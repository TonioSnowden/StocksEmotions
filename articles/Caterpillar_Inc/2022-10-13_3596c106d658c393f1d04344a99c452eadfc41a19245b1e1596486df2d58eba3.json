  "text": "<p>This enviably thick, above-the-lip thatch is the defining physical trait of Ted Lasso, the lovable Midwestern football coach fumbling his way through the hurly-burly world of British soccer. It even has its own Twitter fan account, @TedsMustache, with close to 8,000 followers. And it perfectly matches Mr. Lasso's character: The coach has become a poster boy for nice guys, thanks to an irrepressibly sunny disposition, and his is the golden retriever of 'staches. Thick yet tidy, it helps Mr. Lasso convey affability, vulnerability and humor, said Deborah Nadoolman Landis, founding director of the David C. Copley Center for the Study of Costume Design at UCLA. \"He's a teddy bear and [he] wears it on his face.\"</p><p>Upper-lip bristles are hot right now, whether due to \"Lasso\" inspiration or all that time Americans spent experimenting with facial hair during lockdown—and a reluctance to return to a clean-shaven look for the office. Mustaches, after all, occupy a solid middle ground between beards and baby-smooth faces. Soren Roi, senior barber at Fellow Barber in New York, reports that he has been fielding more mustache requests lately. And the look of the moment? It's the dependable, wholesome 'stache, according to Mr. Roi.</p><p>Ms. Landis credits at least some of the recent growth in mustache interest to Ted Lasso's appeal. \"When an audience falls madly in love with a character on screen, they'll grow mustaches, adjust their hairstyle, buy leather jackets and even fedoras,\" she said. One of the most famous mustachioed leading men, Clark Gable, was \"irresistible with his pencil-thin mustache as Rhett Butler in 'Gone with the Wind,' [and] millions of men grew their own to capture something of his magic,\" said Ms. Landis. Eighty-plus years on, Mr. Lasso is similarly irresistible, she said—even if what he's oozing is not sex appeal but a reliability that makes you want to hug him and share all your secrets.</p><p>Anatomically, Mr. Lasso's 'stache—a plump caterpillar traversing the upper lip—has little in common with Gable's delicate version, which was not much thicker than a pen scrawl. Instead, key Lasso progenitors include television host Steve Harvey and actor Tom Selleck in most any film ever. But perhaps the most notable forefather of the wholesome mustache is Homer Simpson's overly amiable neighbor: Ned Flanders. A picture of aw-shucks earnestness, Mr. Flanders is blessed with a remarkably hale upper-lip thatch, which he and his family refer to as \"Nose Neighbor\" and \"The Push-Broom,\" among other names.</p><p>To get your own push-broom, avoid going too thin, unruly or stylized. This shape is largely defined by what it is not. It most definitely is not one of the downturned varieties found in grainy '70s adult films and sported by the Harley-Davidson set—nor is it a take on the curled handlebars worn by steampunk hipsters and Mr. Monopoly.</p><p>The key to the wholesome mustache, said Fellow Barber's Mr. Roi, is an easy-but-neat fullness. That may present a challenge to men with naturally wispy whiskers but, to give yourself a fighting chance, he recommended leaving your upper-lip growth mostly untended. Maintenance is minimal. Keep your mustache no wider than the corners of your mouth, he said, and trim it so it doesn't encroach on your upper lip. Go easy on the products, too. This mustache \"isn't really 'styled' in any way,\" said Mr. Roi. The only product he suggests trying is a \"hint of beard balm warmed up between the fingers to keep stray hairs in order.\"</p><p>Unlike a beard, which can enhance a face by squaring a jawline, a mustache is just about \"changing your vibe,\" said Mr. Roi. Burke Grantham, 43, a vice president of sales from San Diego, agrees. Mr. Grantham mixes up his look by alternating between a 'stache, a beard and a clean-shaven face. Currently he's in a Lasso-ish phase, with a fuzzy, below-the-nose patch. \"Everything in fashion is cyclical, right? Beards were super 'in' a couple years ago,\" he said. \"But mustaches? Our time is now.\"</p><p>An Affable Mustache Chats to a Raunchier Style from the '70s </p><p>PHOTO: Errata Carmona</p><p>Mr. Affable: Howdy!</p><p>Mr. '70s: Hey, man.</p><p>Mr. Affable: That's quite the curve you've got! Suddenly I'm feeling a bit flat.</p><p>Mr. '70s: Nah. You're straight edge, sure, but you've also got volume. That's what counts.</p><p>Mr. Affable: Gee, thanks buddy!</p><p>Mr. '70s: I mean, you could grow out those corners and slap on some wax. Go wild. But not sure that's your vibe.</p><p>Mr. Affable: Pardon?</p><p>Mr. '70s: Dangerous 'staches like mine are for rockers like Freddie Mercury and film stars…of every variety. You look more like, I wanna say, an accountant?</p><p>Mr. Affable: Excuse me! I mean, yes I am an accountant, but I'm on a rebellious streak. I used twice as much sugar as the recipe called for when I made brownies for the county fair. And I've stopped wearing a tie to work!</p><p>Mr. '70s: I don't wear pants to work.</p><p>Jamie Waters</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you embraced the mustache? Share your experience.
