  "title": "Caterpillar stock had a great October, and that earned it a downgrade; UBS analyst Steven Fisher backs away from year-long bullish stance after stock scores biggest monthly gain in 13 years",
  "text": "<p>The stock has still rocketed 32.2% in October, to make it the best performer among Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA components in the month. It was also headed for the best monthly performance since it soared 33.4% in July 2009.</p><p>Helping propel the stock this month was a big third-quarter profit beat, and the company's assertion that customer demand remained, healthy, strong and robust.</p><p>UBS's Fisher cut his rating on Caterpillar to neutral, after being at buy since October 2021.</p><p>\"Our thesis on positive margin inflection is playing out, and we continue to see a positive trajectory for margins and earnings growth from here,\" Fisher wrote in a note to clients. \"However, with multiples compressing as interest rates rise, the valuation at this time presents a more balanced risk-reward dynamic in our view.\"</p><p>Fisher lifted his base-case price target on Caterpillar's stock to $230 from $225, but the new target implied just 6% upside from current levels.</p><p>His upside target amid a bull-case scenario is $253, or nearly 17% above current levels: \"The bull case is that this is potentially the first of a few quarters in which CAT [Caterpillar] realizes outsized margin improvement driving consensus estimates higher, with multiyear growth still ahead,\" Fisher wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, while his bear-case target of $180 implies about 17% downside: \"The bear case is that a global slowdown in growth leads to demand rolling over in 2023, pressuring commodity prices, CAT pricing and earnings,\" Fisher wrote.</p><p>Caterpillar shares have gained 4.9% year to date, while the SPDR Industrial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLI has shed 10.7% and the Dow industrials have lost 9.7%.</p><p>Caterpillar stock had a great October, and that earned it a downgrade</p>",
