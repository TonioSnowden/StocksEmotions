  "title": "Dow Rises, Nasdaq Falls as Tech Earnings Continue; Meta Platforms shares plunge after disappointing earnings report",
  "text": "<p>TheS&amp;P 500, meanwhile, fell 0.6%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 1.6%. Both suffered their second straight day of losses.</p><p>Stocks have swung lately, driven by continued uncertainty about the pace of interest rates and the latest batch of corporate earnings.</p><p>On Thursday, the latest gross domestic product data showed that the U.S. economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter, the latest sign that the economy is stronger than many have feared throughout the year. Fresh data also showed that the jobs market is holding up well.</p><p>Still, investors are worried that lackluster results so far in technology companies' earningscould be a sign that an economic slowdown is on the horizon. This week, some of the biggest technology firms have reported financial results that have disappointed investors.</p><p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms posted its second revenue decline in a row after markets closed Wednesday. The social-media company is battling a host of challenges, including a tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition and the fallout from Apple's ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its advertising business. Shares plunged 25% and were on track for their biggest one-day decline since the company went public around a decade ago.</p><p>Some investors said they were bracing for bigger losses ahead for tech stocks after an already punishing year.</p><p>\"I would be more skeptical of being tempted to own what might look cheap,\" said Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer and portfolio manager of global equity strategies at Ariel Investments, of Meta shares. \"It seems cheap, but it's an optical illusion.\"</p><p>Google reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth earlier this week, with its YouTube video platform posting a drop in advertising revenue for the first time since the company began reporting the unit's performance. The company's shares fell 2.85% on Thursday, bringing losses for the week to 8.8%.</p><p>\"Some of the tech earnings have been very disappointing,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. Advertising has historically been seen as a bellwether for how the economy is doing, he said, with the decline in that part of earnings \"suggesting the economy is slowing.\"</p><p>Shares of Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the conglomerate housing aerospace, materials and other businesses raised its full-year profit forecast. Caterpillar posted a big increase in third-quarter sales, with demand for its construction and other heavy equipment holding up even as it raised prices. Shares rose 7.7%.</p><p>Intel, Amazon.com, Apple and T-Mobile US will post results after the market close.</p><p>The swings this year in big tech stocks have marked the end of an era for the group of companies dubbed the FAANG stocks. For years, they notched big, simultaneous gains. That trade has unraveled this year.</p><p>\"We've seen these names trade like a block the past few years,\" said Jason Brady, chief executive officer of Thornburg Investment Management. \"We're starting to see both in the stock prices and results, some differentiation in their results.\"</p><p>The volatility hasn't been limited to tech. Shopify shares, for example, jumped 18% in trading on Thursday and were on track for their biggest one-day jump since March.</p><p>In economic news, data from the Commerce Department showed that the U.S. economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the third quarter, snapping two quarters of contraction. Durable-goods orders rose 0.4% in September from the previous month, and new figures showed that 217,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 22, up slightly from the week prior but still near historical lows.</p><p>Investors are also awaiting a Federal Reserve meeting next week where officials are expected to deliver another interest-rate rise of 0.75 percentage point. Some officials have begun signaling their desire both to slow down the pace of increases soon and to stop raising rates early next year to see how their moves this year are slowing the economy. Others have said it is too soon for those discussions due to elevated inflation.</p><p>Many investors remained fixated on the path of interest rates around the globe. The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Thursday. The central bank also said it expects to raise interest rates further as it works to damp inflation.</p><p>\"Globally, the Fed's tightening is working through many different channels, and there is a slight concern that these things affect the real economy with a lag and the Fed is overcooking it,\" Mr. Mackay said, though he said he doubts that the economy is slowing fast enough to stop officials from raising rates further.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.938% from 4.014% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1.3% to trade at $96.96 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down by less than 0.1%.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7%. China's Shanghai Composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.6% and 03%, respectively.</p><p>-Gunjan Banerji contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Rises, Nasdaq Falls as Tech Earnings Continue</p>",
