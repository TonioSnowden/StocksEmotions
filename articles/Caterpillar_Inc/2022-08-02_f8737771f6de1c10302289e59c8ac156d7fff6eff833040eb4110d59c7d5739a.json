  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 54 points, or 0.2%, at 32,742, after falling 376 points at its session low.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 18 points, or 0.4%, at 4,137, erasing an earlier loss.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 118 points, or 1%, to 12,487.</p><p>Stocks ended a seesaw session slightly lower on Monday, with the Dow falling less than 50 points, or 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.2%.</p><p>What's driving the market</p><p>Stocks trimmed losses to turn mixed as Pelosi's plane landed without incident in Taipei Tuesday night local time, or late morning in New York trading hours. Earlier, global equity markets fell as Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, threatened \"serious consequences\" if Pelosi's visit went ahead as planned.</p><p>\"The increase in noise over this trip by China has upped the ante and raised the prospect of a serious miscalculation which neither side really wants. This appears to be a classic case of saber rattling, with neither side wanting to be seen to back down,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.</p><p>Pelosi is the highest ranking elected U.S. official to visit the island in 25 years and comes as part of a trip abroad that has taken the speaker to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan for talks on a variety of topics, including trade, COVID-19, climate change and security.</p><p>After expressing outrage over the trip, Beijing announced plans to carry out military drills and missile tests in an area encircling Taiwan.</p><p>\"The U.S. and Taiwan have colluded to make provocations first, and China has only been compelled to act out of self-defense,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.</p><p>Read: US Speaker Pelosi arrives in Taiwan, raising China tensions</p><p>\"This outcome won't derail the rally (as it's being driven by Fed anticipation). But this is a market that does not need additional headwinds, and escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China will only serve as an additional headwind on stocks—something that won't reverse the rally but could pile on if the outlook turns less rosy,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note.</p><p>The tensions had sparked demand for safe-haven assets, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y sliding in early trade, but then bouncing back to rise around 8.4 basis points to 2.693%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The reversal in yields came as investors digested what economists comments from two Fed speakers. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the Fed is \"nowhere near\" finished with its fight against inflation, though Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he hoped the Fed could raise rates at a slower pace later in the year, but that it would ultimately depend on the data. Neither Daly nor Evans has a vote on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year.</p><p>See: Top Fed officials say U.S. interest rates to keep rising until high inflation eases</p><p>An update on the state of the U.S. labor market showed job openings fell to 10.7 million in June from 11.3 million a month earlier. Openings have dropped three months in a row after peaking in the early spring at a record 11.9 million. The number of people who quit jobs in June, meanwhile, only fell slightly to 4.23 million, the Labor Department said Tuesday.</p><p>U.S. stocks rose sharply in July, bouncing back from 2022 lows set in June. Stocks fell into a bear market this year as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation that continues to run at its hottest in around four decades. So far, the market rebound has helped the Dow to exit correction territory.</p><p>See: JP Morgan quant who called summer rebound in stocks says rally could continue even if corporate profits decline</p><p>The Fed's sharp tightening has stirred recession fears, though stocks have found support from the idea that an economic slowdown could lead the Fed to slow the pace of rate increases, or perhaps even begin cutting rates in 2023 — a prospect that has bolstered stocks, even as many economists and analysts have expressed skepticism.</p><p>Read: Did the stock market peer through 'rose-colored glasses' as tech surged in July?</p><p>Investors were also weighing another busy day of earnings reports, which have so far come in better than feared.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. UBER surged more than 16% after the ride-hailing and delivery services company swung to a second-quarter loss but reported a more than doubling in revenue that beat expectations by a wide margin and became cash-flow positive for the first time.</p><p>* Caterpillar Inc. CAT shares fell 3.4% to lead Dow decliners after the construction and mining equipment maker reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations but sales that came up short, as higher pricing and sales volume were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts.</p><p>* TD Bank Group TD said Tuesday it would buy investment bank Cowen Inc. COWN for $1.3 billion, or $39 a share, a premium of about 10% over its closing price of $35.49 a share on Monday and a purchase price multiple of 8.1 times Cowen's estimated 2023 earnings. Cowen shares rose 8%, while TD shares declined 0.5%.</p><p>* Pinterest Inc.

Pinterest shares rose 12.7%.</p><p>* Shares of DuPont de Nemours Inc. DD fell 0.6% after the specialty materials and chemicals company reported second-quarter profit and sales that beat expectationsbut provided a downbeat third-quarter outlook, citing foreign currency headwinds and unplanned downtime at a Virginia site.</p><p>* JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU fell 5% after the airline reported a larger loss than analysts had been expecting. </p><p>* Sabre Corp.
