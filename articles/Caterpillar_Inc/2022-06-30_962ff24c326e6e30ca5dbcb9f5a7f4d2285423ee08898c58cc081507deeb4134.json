  "title": "S&P 500 Posts Worst First Half of Year Since 1970; Stocks fell to wrap up a grueling second quarter",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 finished down 33.45 points, or 0.9%, to 3785.38, bringing its losses for the first half of the year to 21%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 253.88 points, or 0.8%, to 30775.43, while the Nasdaq Composite retreated 149.16 points, or 1.3%, to 11028.74.</p><p>Thursday's losses capped off stocks' worst first half of the year since 1970, a stunning reversal of the rally that lifted markets around the world the preceding two years. Investors place much of the blame on inflation. Price pressures that many had assumed would be transitory turned out to be more persistent than they thought. That forced central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to pivot from holding interest rates near historic lows to raising them rapidly in an effort to cool inflation.</p><p>Now, many investors worry central banks' actions could push the global economy into recession. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech Wednesday that he was more concerned about failing to stamp out high inflation than the possibility of raising interest rates too much and having the economy go into a downturn. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde made similar remarks.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.973% from 3.091% on Wednesday. The yield on the benchmark note, which helps set rates for everything from student loans to mortgages, soared in the first half of the year as central banks tightened monetary policy.</p><p>About 90% of investors expect the U.S. to enter a recession before the end of 2023, according to a survey published Thursday by Deutsche Bank. Many investors are also bracing for further losses. Despite the S&amp;P 500 having tumbled into a bear market—defined as a 20% drop from a recent high—72% of investors surveyed said they expect the S&amp;P 500 to fall further before it stages a sustained recovery.</p><p>One reason for that could be that some investors still think many stocks are overvalued following a largely uninterrupted run-up in share prices the preceding two years.</p><p>Analyst estimates currently suggest S&amp;P 500 companies will report double-digit percentage growth in earnings in the second half of the year, according to FactSet. Those estimates seem far too optimistic, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US.</p><p>\"The market needs to get more objectively cheap,\" Mr. Donabedian said.</p><p>Technology and consumer discretionary stocks, which have been among the hardest hit areas of the stock market in this year's selloff, extended losses Thursday. Amazon.com fell $2.71, or 2.5%, to $106.21 and Apple was down $2.51, or 1.8%, to $136.72.</p><p>The Fed's pivot from holding interest rates at rock bottom to raising them fueled a reversal of many market bets that had flourished the past two years—especially bets on shares of rapidly growing companies trading at relatively high valuations. The tech-focused Nasdaq posted its worst quarter since 2008.</p><p>Growing fears of recession also hit shares of cyclical companies, whose businesses tend to be sensitive to changes in economic conditions, on Thursday.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 1.6%. Shares of manufacturers and industrial companies also declined, with Caterpillar, Boeing and United States Steel each falling more than 1%.</p><p>Even consumer staples stocks fell. Initially, many traders had seen shares of companies selling everyday goods that consumers rely on as relatively safe investments, since in theory, demand for their goods should stay the same even in a cooling economy.</p><p>Recently, that view has weakened as some major retailers have warned that they, too, are being hit by rising inflation. Data released Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rose at its slowest pace yet this year in May as shoppers struggled with high inflation. Grocer Kroger fell 78 cents, or 1.6%, to $47.33.</p><p>Energy stocks declined too, with the S&amp;P 500 energy sector losing 2%. Shares of oil producers have fallen from their highs of the year in recent weeks as investors have weighed the benefits of high oil prices against the risks of recession, which could hit demand for energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, selling pressure in the cryptocurrencies market showed no sign of easing as the dollar value of bitcoin fell to around $19,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has lost more than a third of its value this month as investors broadly retreated from risky assets.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.5%, led by losses among auto makers. For the quarter, the index lost 11%, marking its worst quarterly performance since the first three months of 2020.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mostly lower. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 1.5% while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index weakened by 0.6%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index was an exception, rising 1.1%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Posts Worst First Half of Year Since 1970</p>",
