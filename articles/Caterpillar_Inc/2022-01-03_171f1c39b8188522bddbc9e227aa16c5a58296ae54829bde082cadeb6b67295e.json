ALK tops the list of analysts' favorite large-cap stocks for 2022.

Other travel and hospitality-related recovery plays on the list include Caesars Entertainment Inc. CZR and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV.</p><p>There are four oil-related stocks on the list, three of which rose significantly during 2021. West Texas Crude oil CL00 was up 59% for 2021 through Dec. 30 based on forward-month contracts, while the S&amp;P 500 energy sector returned 54%.</p><p>Other stocks on the list that performed very well during 2021 and are expected to do so again in 2022 include Generac Holdings Inc. GNRC, Bath &amp; Body Works Inc. BBWI and General Motors Co.
