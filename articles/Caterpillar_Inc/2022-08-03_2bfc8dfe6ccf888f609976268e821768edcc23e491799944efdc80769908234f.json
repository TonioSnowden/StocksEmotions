  "text": "<p>The California Democrat landed in Taiwan on Tuesday and was scheduled to meet later with Taiwanese officials, in the first visit by a House speaker to the democratically governed island since 1997. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, had warned Mrs. Pelosi not to go through with the trip. Chinese officials had threatened unspecified countermeasures should her visit proceed.</p><p>Asian stocks sold off. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite dropped 2.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.4%. The Chinese benchmarks recovered early Wednesday. Mrs. Pelosi's visit came against a fragile backdrop for markets. The U.S. economy is struggling with the twin threats of soaring inflation and rapidly rising interest rates -- part of the Fed's stated goal to fight rising prices even if it knocks economic growth.</p><p>Stocks have rebounded in recent weeks on hopes that the worst of inflation and rate rises could be over. But comments from Fed officials on Tuesday suggested such enthusiasm might be premature.</p><p>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said in an interview with CNBC that the Fed was \"nowhere near\" done increasing interest rates. Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans expressed hope that the central bank could slow its pace of rate rises but indicated that another 0.75-percentage-point hike in September \"could also be OK.\"</p><p>\"Even if you think the inflation dragon has been slain there is still a lot to worry about,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>Investors also were keeping an eye on corporate earnings, which so far have largely performed better than feared.</p><p>Pinterest jumped $2.32, or 12%, to $22.31 after activist investor Elliott Management confirmed it was the social-media company's biggest investor and Pinterest's new chief executive said he would focus on profit.</p><p>Uber rallied $4.65, or 19%, to $29.25 after its revenue more than doubled, signaling the ride-hailing company's efforts to trim its losses were working.</p><p>Caterpillar tumbled $11.35, or 5.8%, to $183.51, weighing on the Dow, after the equipment manufacturer's sales figures missed analysts' forecasts. JetBlue sank 55 cents, or 6.4%, to $8.04 after the airline reported a loss for the second quarter.</p><p>Treasury prices fell, sending yields higher, after jitters over Mrs. Pelosi's trip had earlier sent investors scurrying to assets considered havens. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.740% after sinking to 2.605% on Monday, its lowest level since April. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Earlier, bond markets flashed a warning sign as the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes briefly inverted for the first time since the start of the pandemic, an indicator that the Fed says has the best record of predicting a recession.</p><p>The difference in the yields declined to minus 0.001 percentage point before edging back into positive territory, according to Tradeweb.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
