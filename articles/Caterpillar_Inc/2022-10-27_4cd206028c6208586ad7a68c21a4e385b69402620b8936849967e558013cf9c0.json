  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 369 points, or 1.2%, to 32,208.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 18 points, or 0.5%, at 3,849.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 20 points, or 0.2%, to trade at 10,991.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow eked out a tiny gain to extend its winning streak to four sessions, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2%. The Nasdaq Composite is up 6.3% from its 2022 closing low, which it hit on Oct. 14, but remains down 29.9% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks rose after third-quarter GDP came in 2.6% higher on an annual basis and above the 2.3% gain economists expected. Other data showed durable-goods orders rising 0.4% in September. The latest weekly initial jobless-claims data showed a 3,000 gain,to 217,000.</p><p>Just ahead of that data, theEuropean Central Bank announced a widely expectedinterest-rate increase of 75 basis points, to 1.5%, as expected on Thursday. Investors will now wait for the press conference with ECB President Christine Lagarde, due to begin at 8:45 a.m. Eastern. The dollar hovered around parity with the euro EURUSD.</p><p>But investors have been distracted Thursday by the latest gloomy set of earnings on the tech front.</p><p>Big Tech was supposed to be the place that provided investors with some safety during an economic slowdown, but traders have learned that the high valuations these companies were afforded have made them very vulnerable to any indication of cyclical difficulties.</p><p>Need to Know: Why the rout for big tech companies may just be getting started</p><p>After Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOG earnings disappointed late on Tuesday, Meta's META attempted transformation to a metaverse platform was not well received by the market.</p><p>Shares in the company formerly known as Facebook dropped 23.8%, falling below $100.</p><p>Read: Analysts slash their ratings on Meta as costs balloon.

Hopes that resilience would burn brightly through this U.S. earnings season have dimmed,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>However, Mark Newton, technical strategist at Fundstrat, saw the positive in the latest market action. \"The important takeaway for all investors Wednesday focused on stock indices being able to rally sharply off the lows despite poor Tech earnings as rates followed through further to the downside,\" he wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>\"That's an important point … it shows us all that markets are focusing more on interest rate changes (and should eventually focus on declining inflation) more than negative earnings,\" Newton added.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4% after its meeting next week, but recent soft U.S. economic data have built hopes that the central bank may decelerate its pace of tightening thereafter — a perception that has helped the S&amp;P 500 index climb 7.1% through Wednesday off its 2022 low, set two weeks ago.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Shopify Technology Inc. SHOP rose 9% after the e-commerce company notched a smaller loss than anticipated and forecast that its operating-expense growth rate will fall sequentially in the current quarter.</p><p>* Comcast Corp. CMCSA shares rose 6.6% after the company added net new internet subscribers against what's been a tough recent backdrop for growth. The 10,000 net subscriber gain in its residential broadband business and 5,000 net gain in business broadband came after Comcast posted a net of no new internet subscribers in aggregate during the second quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Dow component Caterpillar Inc. CAT rose more than 8% after the maker of construction and mining equipment topped estimates for the third quarter.</p><p>* McDonald's Corp. MCD shares gained 2.5% after the fast-food giant and Dow component blew past estimates for the third quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP fell 2.8% after the company's third-quarter earnings fell sharply from the year earlier as inflationary pressures weighed.</p><p>Barbara Kollmeyer contributed to this report.</p><p>U.S. stocks higher after GDP data, but tech stocks hit by Meta results ahead of Apple, Amazon earnings</p>",
