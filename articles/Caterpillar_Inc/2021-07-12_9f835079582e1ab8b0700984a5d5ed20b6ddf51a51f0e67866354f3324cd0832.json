  "text": "<p>The extraordinary popularity of the late Eric Carle's books isn't simply due to the vivid collage artwork or the text that can endure umpteen re-readings. A good picture book, if it's to stand the test of time, should have some universal lesson embedded within. In the case of Carle's best-known title, <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em> (1969), the imagery of a food-fattened caterpillar becoming a glorious butterfly teaches that change may be difficult but can also be positive.</p> <p>David Ouimet's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786897776/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1786897776&amp;linkId=8342eec2d67fb97060da5ba68a7200be\"><strong>I Get Loud</strong></a> (Canongate, £12.99) conveys a similar message. A girl who expresses herself demonstratively, symbolised by the bright red kite she flies, finds companionship in a smaller, quieter girl. The pair then become displaced from their home town. They cross the sea in separate boats, part of a flotilla of desperate, haunted-looking refugees, and are reunited in a new land.</p> <p>The language is poetic while the illustrations are darkly gorgeous, with muted hues and linework as blocky as a woodcut. The book is a follow-up to 2019's <em>I Go Quiet</em> and, like its predecessor, offers balm to the introverted and to anyone unsure of their place in the world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1913339173/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1913339173&amp;linkId=056afe5d63e2671c768443808b184ad6\"><strong>Sunflower Sisters</strong></a> (Owlet Press, £7.99) by Monika Singh Gangotra and Michaela Dias-Hayes is likewise about two girls who are friends. Amrita and Kiki come from different communities — south Asian and Nigerian respectively — and find commonality in their love of bright dresses. The book also tackles colourism: the belief in some cultures that paler skin is more desirable. Self-acceptance, regardless of familial pressures, is the focus here.</p> <p>The theme of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1787418979/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1787418979&amp;linkId=f84813ea325333306959e23eb4437732\"><strong>Daisy's Dragons</strong></a> (Studio Press, £6.99) is feelings. Each of Daisy's key emotions — happiness, calmness, anger, fear, sadness and bravery — manifests as a dragon that only she can see. When they get out of control, some of the dragons loom larger while others dwindle and disappear. The solution lies in a balance of all six and the understanding that even feelings that seem negative are there for a reason. The book, by Frances Stickley and Annabel Tempest, is lovingly rendered and its central conceit is well sustained.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1839941561/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1839941561&amp;linkId=e153d404d59b3ec9cb5e80dc87560239\"><strong>The Cat and the Rat and the Hat</strong></a> (Nosy Crow, £11.99), by Em Lynas and Matt Hunt, is a more rambunctious affair. A cat and a rat vie over a shocking-pink hat. Then, to complicate matters further, along comes a bat in a no-less-pink cravat, resulting in a dispute that nobody wins. The text's pounding rhyme scheme will be picked up by toddlers in no time, and the knockabout humour, which owes something to <em>Tom and Jerry</em> cartoons, is a hoot.</p> <p>The latest from collaborative cohabitees Sue Hendra and Paul Linnet, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1471196275/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1471196275&amp;linkId=39d1c22cfd747f1e0e805656f3d8fede\"><strong>I Spy Island</strong></a> (Simon and Schuster, £6.99), sees a treasure chest wash up on the shores of a sentient desert island. At first the chest is standoffish, keeping apart from the other inhabitants — a glove, a banana, a bottle and a bird — in order to protect the valuables inside it. Soon enough, though, it's joining in their games, and even sacrifices its riches to give its newfound friends shelter during a storm. There's surely a moral about the “one per cent” here; there's also the gaudy, nonsensical fun we've come to expect from the creators of <em>Barry the Fish With Fingers</em> and <em>Supertato</em>.</p> <p>Lo Cole's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/172823817X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=172823817X\"><strong>We Want a Dog</strong></a> (Sourcebooks, £13.99) is a more toned-down affair. The art restricts itself to a palette of black, white and red and has a beautiful design aesthetic. The text lists all the kinds of dogs one might adopt, and their various drawbacks, before coming to the conclusion that a cat might make a better pet. Dog lovers know, however, that imperfections are all part of the fun.</p> <p>Speaking of which, Barbara Nascimbeni's pleasingly whimsical <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0500652619/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0500652619&amp;linkId=8ddd5055b0e8425ac10a9cd4c7f3dca6\"><strong>Home Alone</strong></a> (Thames &amp; Hudson, £10.99) imagines what our canine friends get up to while we're out of the house. In the case of Frido, it's scootering, raiding the fridge, having guests round, ordering pizza, and even doing yoga. And definitely <em>not</em> making a mess.</p> <p>Lisa Sheehan's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1780557027/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1780557027&amp;linkId=f185be65c6076da2960d19194b4d5078\"><strong>Just Being Ted</strong></a> (Buster Books, £6.99) is a lovely fable about a shunned, misunderstood dragon with a creative soul. He infiltrates the bears' picnic disguised as one of them in order to make friends, only to discover that being himself is enough.</p> <p>A sense of loneliness in a time of coronavirus permeates the book, as it does more explicitly in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/057137039X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=057137039X&amp;linkId=43b17af48bbc38901d4d0dd4d0e789ac\"><strong>The Longer the Wait, the Bigger the Hug</strong></a> (Faber, £6.99). Here, hug-loving Hedgehog — from two earlier books by Eoin McLaughlin and Polly Dunbar — emerges from hibernation yearning for best friend Tortoise, who is nowhere to be found. The simplicity of the tale resonates. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1913339289/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1913339289&amp;linkId=8969ee15e7b410418c0f7a14f46db8df\"><strong>The Wonderful World Was Waiting</strong></a> (Owlet Press, £7.99) by Lauren Fennemore and Zoe Damoulakis, is specifically about lockdown, with mentions of masks and the two-metre rule. These references will date it quickly, but it's a book very pertinent to the here and now.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: James Lovegrove 2021 'Genre round-up — the best in children's books' FT.com 12 July.
