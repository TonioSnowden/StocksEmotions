  "text": "<p>Caterpillar said it continued to raise its prices to counter higher material costs, and freight transportation and manufacturing inefficiencies from supply-chain problems. Price increases contributed $1.6 billion to overall sales, which reached $15 billion in the quarter. The company said its material and freight costs have increased by about one-fifth since 2020.</p><p>\"We still have supply-chain struggles that we're dealing with, but we also have strong demand across most of our end markets,\" Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said during a conference call with analysts.</p><p>The company, based in Irving, Texas, said its operating profit margin in the quarter expanded to 16.2% from 13.4% a year earlier. Caterpillar's shares closed up nearly 8%, to $212.14, in Thursday trading.</p><p>Unfavorable exchange rates when sales in foreign currencies were converted into U.S. dollars sliced $461 million from sales in the quarter, Caterpillar said. The dollar's value against foreign currencies has been rising, putting U.S.-based companies with foreign operations, such as Caterpillar, at a disadvantage.</p><p>Sales of the company's yellow construction equipment, such as bulldozers, rose by 19% to $6.3 billion for the quarter, with higher sales recorded across all of the company's geographic markets, especially in North America and Latin America.</p><p>Caterpillar said residential construction activity is moderating but remains at an elevated level. Nonresidential construction activity is strong, the company said, and Caterpillar expects the market to continue to improve in the months ahead, boosted by higher spending in the U.S. on government-funded public works and infrastructure projects.</p><p>Expanding investments in oil and natural gas production are driving higher demand for Caterpillar's engines used at drilling sites and pipelines, the company said. It reported a 22% increase in its energy and transportation business to $6.2 billion during the quarter.</p><p>The company said its mining-equipment sales jumped 30% to $3.1 billion, helped by a 66% increase in sales in North America.</p><p>Overall, for the three months ended Sept. 30, Caterpillar reported a profit of $2 billion, or $3.87 a share, up from $1.4 billion, or $2.60 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales and profit from the quarter exceeded analysts' expectations.</p><p>â€”Sabela Ojea contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>Caterpillar Says Construction Equipment Remains in Demand, Boosting Sales, Profit</p>",
