  "title": "How to inherit a garden: the complexities of horticultural legacy",
  "text": "<p>Some gardens and landscapes are works of art that deserve to be left to posterity. But unlike an oil painting of an enigmatic smile or a stainless steel sculpture of a balloon dog, their changeable nature makes them tricky legacies.</p> <p>Owners get a buzz out of adapting their garden after a feature tree falls, an obelisk crumbles, a gnome escapes, a stream decides to dry up or a pivotal plant variety succumbs to disease. But faced with the same problems, what should an inheritor do? Should inheritors stick to the garden's design and original planting? Should donors impose conditions? How should inheritors deal with benefactors' wishes?</p> <p>Plas yn Rhiw, a pretty one-acre garden overlooking Cardigan Bay in Wales, was given to the National Trust in the mid-20th century on condition that, among other things, the wild bees should not be disturbed and the yew and box hedges should be preserved. The former condition is fine — admirable even — but the latter is tricky as box is victim to three types of blight, Phytophthora root rot and Box tree caterpillar — to say nothing of various scale insects, red spider mite . . . you get the idea.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, it's no surprise that the Trust has become increasingly picky about what it takes on. But in the past few decades, alternative solutions are emerging for bequeathed gardens.</p> <p>Great Dixter in southern England, is one such. Christopher “Christo” Lloyd's garden has continued to thrive and evolve since his death in 2006. His<br>gardening style was rebellious and his infamous gesture against pastel flower colours back in the 1990s set the tone for continuing rebellion at Great Dixter, which is now headed by Fergus Garrett.</p> <p>“Since Christo's death in 2006 I have used pastel colours about five or six times but every time I do it, it raises eyebrows,” says Garrett. “This year in the Solar Garden I have used grey on grey predominantly and it looks great — but not to everyone's taste. Next year it will probably be shocking magenta and scarlet — but only if the wind takes us that way — never as a result of yielding to public pressure.”</p> <p>“It is important not to copy so much as to keep the sense of adventure, whimsy, joyousness, strong work ethic, inquisitiveness and pass all that on,” says Garrett, who learnt his skills at Christo's knee. “Christo set up the trust and we chose trustees together and made me director.”</p> <p>Great Dixter is a small charity, says Garrett, that works hard to break even. With a turnover of more than £1mn, it supports 50 full-time and part-time employees, including guides. “We could open for weddings and have a restaurant to make more money but that would destroy Dixter,” he says. “We raise money through study days, plant fairs and so on and plough it back into the garden, student bursaries and into employing local people.”</p> <p>What's the succession plan now? “There are four or five people who could take over — ex-students or gardeners,” he says.</p> <p>Sir Roy Strong's garden, The Laskett in Herefordshire, is a living archive of his life, his marriage to the designer Julia Trevelyan Oman and, well, a rich cultural history. In 1999 the National Trust declined his offer to donate The Laskett because, in the words of a representative: “[The gardens did not meet] our strict criteria on significance, nor did we believe that the National Trust needed to acquire the gardens to secure their future.”</p> <p>In 2021, Perennial, formerly the Gardeners' Benevolent Institution, accepted Strong's generous gift of The Laskett and showcased it in a Chelsea Flower Show video earlier this year.</p> <p>“They asked me to be a trustee for The Laskett,” says Strong about the garden he and Trevelyan-Oman created from scratch from 1972. He refused: “I've sat on every bloody committee in this country. That's it!”</p> <p>“There's only one way to live: forward,” says Strong, who started creating his new garden two years ago a few miles down the road from The Laskett, although he adds that his ashes will join his wife's at his original garden. Eventually, Perennial will inherit a share of Strong's estate, he says, adding that “the value of what I gave them was £3mn, which is not an insignificant amount”.</p> <p>Money, “in millions rather than hundreds of thousands”, is one of five tests that Perennial applies to any garden legacy offered. The charity's chief executive Peter Newman explains the tests as follows: “Is it a garden of significance? Is it idiosyncratic? Was it made with passion, skill and love? Does it present any financial risk? Is it in the right place for the charity to spread its message across the UK? Is the garden given without any restrictions?</p> <p>“Our day job is to look after horticulturists and garden makers,” he says of the charity's core mission. “The gardens we accept transmit our message, introduce potential supporters and must run as profit centres, not cost centres.”</p> <p>Endowments are crucial for institutions considering whether or not to accept a garden gift, although estimates about how much money is needed vary as wildly as the gardens. “The Trust uses a periodically reviewed formula to calculate the required endowment for a property to ensure it will have a sustainable future. This takes into account factors such as long-term cyclical maintenance tasks,” a National Trust spokesperson tells me.</p> <p>Armando Pizzoni Ardemani hopes that his family can continue to retain their 17th-century gardens at Valsanzibio in Veneto, Italy, as they have for three generations.</p> <p>The 8-hectare garden was described by Edith Wharton in 1903 as “one of the most beautiful pleasure-grounds in Italy”. Its historic trees, water tricks, allegorical statues and maze are reached by a magnificent water gate where gondolas used to glide from Venice in the days when canals stretched 60km to the great trading city. Its hard and soft landscaping are as delightful to visit as they are arduous to maintain.</p> <p>Pizzoni has transformed Valsanzibio into a going concern by opening it to the public and selling a parcel of land to an American institution. He is also hoping for a €2mn EU grant. On the other hand, he says, “I don't want to force the kids to take this on.”</p> <p>He says his sons, aged 12 and 17, love Valsanzibio “but theirs is a childish<br>love. This place can give you a lot of satisfaction but it is a lot of responsibility. You have to have passion like I do,” says Pizzoni, who wants to create a circular economy generating energy, plants and animals from the estate, which includes 200 hectares of woodland.</p> <p>Passion and money help shape some of the world's most remarkable gardens, and help some to outlive their creators: Derek Jarman's wild seaside garden in the lee of Dungeness power station on the UK's south coast is helped along by £3.5mn from an Art Fund campaign, which keeps gardener Jonny Bruce and others <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85ac9848-e8f0-11e9-aefb-a946d2463e4b\">tending it for the future.</a> </p> <p>The new owners of Peter Smithers' woodland garden in Switzerland above Lake Lugano have the passion and understanding to keep the garden going to Smithers' plan, although it is never officially open to the public. Little Sparta, the beautiful, complex, 7-acre landscape created by artist Ian Hamilton Finlay and his wife Sue in the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh, is held together by a trust set up before Hamilton Finlay's death in 2006.</p> <p>Other historically important private gardens, such as Rousham in Oxfordshire, for instance, have managed to keep going thanks to dedicated families who have owned the respective gardens for centuries.</p> <p>In the US, Oak Spring garden in Virginia opens only occasionally but showcases how important gardens can successfully pass on to future generations. </p> <p>Owner Bunny Mellon, who created two White House gardens, created her own over half a century. Glitterati including Jackie Kennedy were regular visitors. On her death in 2014, philanthropist Mellon left funds but no conditions about the garden or her estate. Her primary concern was her renowned library of manuscripts, books and works of art relating to horticulture, landscape design, botany and natural history.</p> <p>Sir Peter Crane (a former director of Kew) was appointed Oak Spring president in 2016, thus facing the task of transforming it from an idiosyncratic private domain to a place that scholars and artists visit from all over the world. He bought back land to recreate the core of the once 4,000-acre estate and set about restoring the gardens, mindful of Mellon's comment that “Gardens, like many beautiful things one thinks will never change . . . never die — they follow the cycle of all living things — never remaining the same . . . ”</p> <p>The ever-changing gardens have never looked better and, quite apart from Mellon's helpful comment on the cycle of living things, she seems to have come up with an excellent formula for garden legacies: involve the right people, throw in a sizeable endowment and make no conditions.</p> <p><em>Jane Owen is an FT contributing editor and Chelsea Flower Show gold medallist</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram</em>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Jane Owen 2022 'How to inherit a garden: the complexities of horticultural legacy' FT.com 14 October.
