  "text": "<p>With a month-to-date gain of 14%, the Dow DJIA is on track for its best monthly performance since January 1976, when it rose 14.4%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. To clinch its best October ever, it only needs to hang on to a month-to-date gain of 10.65% by the time the U.S. market closes on Monday.</p><p>The Dow is still in a bear market and remains down more than 10% for the year to date. That compares, however, with year-to-date losses of 18.6% for the S&amp;P 500 SPX and 29.6% for the Nasdaq Composite COMP.</p><p>What exactly has made the Dow's October performance so stellar?</p><p>The blue-chip gauge is packed with energy and industrials stocks, which have been among the best performing sectors for the stock market since the start of the year, noted Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.</p><p>These stocks have performed particularly well since the start of the latest quarterly earnings season, while megacap technology names like Meta Platforms Inc. META, Amazon.com Inc. AMZNand Alphabet Inc. GOOG have sputtered after delivering results and guidance that disappointed Wall Street this week.</p><p>\"It's very tech-light, and it's very heavy in energy and industrials, and those have been the winners,\" Hogan said. \"The Dow just has more of the winners embedded in it and that has been the secret to its success.\"</p><p>See: Live markets coverage</p><p>The Dow is on track to log its highest close in at least two months on Friday as it outperforms both the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP. Furthermore, it's on track to climb for a sixth straight session, what would be its longest winning streak since May 27, according to DJMD.</p><p>Adding to the list of notable factoids, the average is also on track to log a fourth straight weekly gain, which would cement its longest winning streak since Nov. 5, 2021, when the index rose for five straight weeks.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Chevron Corp. CVX And Amgen Inc. AMGNare the top-performing Dow stocks so far this month, having gained 29.3%, 21.2% and 18.3%, respectively, as of Friday.</p><p>In recent trade, the blue-chip average was up around 700 points, or 2.2%, on track for its biggest daily point and percentage gain in exactly one week.</p><p>Why the Dow is having a killer month as it heads for best October ever</p>",
