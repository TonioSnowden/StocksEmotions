  "text": "<p>The pandemic drove a surge in use of Twitter a year ago that could be hard for it to sustain, the company said in a letter to investors. As a result, Twitter said, user growth rates may rise by a low double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis for the rest of the year, with the low point occurring in the current quarter.</p><p>The San Francisco company reported its daily user base rose 3.6% to 199 million from the previous quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the user count to rise to 199.5 million.</p><p>Shares of Twitter, which have more than doubled over the past year, fell 9% following the report.</p><p>Twitter posted earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $1.04 billion, up from a loss of 1 cent a share and revenue of $807.6 million in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Analysts were expecting a loss of 2 cents a share on revenue of $1.03 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>-- Georgia Wells</p><p>CATERPILLAR</p><p>Caterpillar Inc. posted higher profit and revenue in the latest quarter as increased demand from construction and industrial-equipment users boosted the company's results.</p><p>The heavy-equipment maker, based in Deerfield, Ill., logged a first-quarter profit of $1.53 billion, up from $1.09 billion in the year-earlier period.</p><p>Revenue increased to $11.89 billion, more than analysts were expecting, from $10.64 billion a year earlier, the company said.</p><p>Construction sales climbed 27% to $5.46 billion as higher end-user demand drove better volumes. Resource-industries sales grew by 6% to $2.22 billion, boosted by greater demand from the mining industry, the company said.</p><p>Improved demand from the power-generation and oil-and-gas industries helped energy-and-transportation sales grow by 4% to $4.51 billion, it said.</p><p>-- Austen Hufford</p><p>NORTHROP GRUMMAN</p><p>Northrop Grumman Corp. said its sales rose for the first quarter as it booked gains in the space systems, mission systems and aeronautics systems segments.</p><p>The Falls Church, Va., company posted earnings of $2.19 billion, up from $868 million a year earlier. Sales rose 6% to $9.2 billion, better than analysts were expecting.</p><p>Space-systems sales rose 29% to $2.52 billion. Mission- systems sales increased 10% to $2.59 billion. Aeronautics-systems sales grew 5% to $2.99 billion. Defense systems fell 17% to $1.56 billion.</p><p>\"Based on our strong first quarter results and solid outlook for the year, we are raising 2021 sales and [earnings per share] guidance,\" Chief Executive Kathy Warden said.</p><p>-- Doug Cameron</p><p>KRAFT HEINZ</p><p>Kraft Heinz Co. is making more of its products that include ketchup and macaroni and cheese, which remain in high demand.</p><p>The food giant said profit and revenue for the latest quarter topped expectations, as cost cuts and higher prices offset higher shipping and commodity costs. Kraft Heinz said it is expanding manufacturing capacity for some of its bestsellers because some of its businesses can't keep up with demand.</p><p>\"Even though we expect to be operating in a very unpredictable environment for some time, we are showing even stronger momentum than anticipated,\" CEO Miguel Patricio said on a conference call.</p><p>Shares rose 3.9% Thursday.</p><p>Demand for groceries has been slowing in recent months compared with last year, when people flooded grocery stores at the onset of the pandemic. Kraft Heinz's comparable sales rose 2.5% in the latest quarter.</p><p>Kraft Heinz reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share on sales of $6.39 billion. Analysts expected a profit of 60 cents a share and $6.25 billion in revenue.</p><p>-- Annie Gasparro</p><p>AIRBUS</p><p>Airbus SE swung to a profit in the first quarter and said it was planning to increase production in anticipation of greater demand for its planes.</p><p>The company reported net income of 362 million euros, about $438 million, up from a net loss of 481 million euros a year earlier, partly because of stronger dollar hedges and cost cutting. Sales dipped slightly to 10.5 billion euros from 10.6 billion euros.</p><p>The plane maker delivered 125 commercial aircraft in the first three months of the year -- three more than in the year-earlier period -- made up mainly of its A320 family of single-aisle jets. Airbus is betting demand for those smaller planes will start to come back in the second half of the year, and said it was readying itself and its supply chain to take advantage as quickly as possible. Smaller single-aisle planes are typically for domestic and short-haul travel, which is showing recovery in the U.S. and China.</p><p>Still, the company cautioned that any recovery likely won't be linear. Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the surge in Covid-19 cases in India, one of Airbus's biggest markets, was an \"area of great concern\" and stressed that European airlines remain in difficult positions with much of the continent still battling the virus.</p><p>The market is even less rosy for larger, wide-body aircraft, with any turnaround in demand not expected until next summer at the earliest, Mr. Faury said.</p><p>-- Benjamin Katz</p><p>MASTERCARD</p><p>Mastercard Inc.'s revenue rose in the first quarter as the company logged an increase in gross dollar volume, but cross-border volume still decreased.</p><p>The card company's earnings increased to $1.83 billion, or $1.83 a share, up from a year earlier's $1.69 billion, or $1.68 a share. Adjusted earnings were $1.74 a share. According to FactSet, analysts were expecting $1.58 a share.</p><p>Net revenue was $4.16 billion, up from $4.01 billion. Analysts were expecting $4 billion.</p><p>Mastercard said its gross dollar volume on a local-currency basis rose 8%. Cross-border volume fell 17% on a local-currency basis, according to the company, and switched transactions rose 9%.</p><p>Mastercard Chief Executive Michael Miebach said the company \"was encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre-pandemic trends.\"</p><p>-- Allison Prang</p><p>EBAY</p><p>EBay Inc. shares fell 10% after it said revenue growth was poised to slow in the second quarter with economies returning to more normal conditions.</p><p>EBay gained ground last year as consumers spent more time at home and shifted to e-commerce. Revenue rose 20% on a comparable basis for the year, and merchandise volumes, which measure the value of deals between buyers and sellers, totaled $100 billion. Ebay said Wednesday it expects to earn a per-share profit between 91 cents and 96 cents after adjustments in the second quarter.</p><p>-- Micah Maidenberg</p>",
