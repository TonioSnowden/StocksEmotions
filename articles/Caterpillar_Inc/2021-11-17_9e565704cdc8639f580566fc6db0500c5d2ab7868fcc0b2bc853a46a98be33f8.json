  "title": "Arts in Review -- Architecture Review: Extreme Makeover at the Y --- The new YMCA in the Bronx is a welcoming, modern achievement",
  "text": "<p>The $60 million, 52,000-square-foot project was designed by Marvel, a firm of architects based in New York and Puerto Rico, and headed by Jonathan Marvel. If you first notice the informality of his ensemble, next you notice how imaginatively he uses windows and lines of sight to knit it into the community beyond. He clearly decided that a show of hospitality, open to the neighborhood, would be treated more respectfully than an aloof citadel. After all, nothing says vandalize me as loudly as a blank wall.</p><p>Circulation, the art of directing separate groups of people to separate destinations, is something we notice only when it goes wrong. Here it is invisible. The building's logic instantly becomes clear as soon as you step through the main entrance and all three pavilions loom into view. Looking from right to left, you see first the wellness center, then the gymnasium, and finally the pool, where the corridor widens into a viewing lounge so that parents can relax and watch their children as they swim. The intervals between these pavilions are glazed from floor to ceiling, giving the sense that the building is but a provisional enclosure, set delicately upon the site, as lightly as a tent.</p><p>The building will not please everyone. The sticking point is the material of the pavilions themselves, the corrosion-resistant metal known as Corten steel. This complex alloy of steel, chromium, copper and other trace elements develops an outer protective layer of rust that actually defies further rusting. Over time, its distinctive orange rust will weather to a mellow ruddy patina, but to those unaccustomed to the material, it can look distressingly like the hulk of a junked battleship. It is meant here to complement the wooded setting in a way that no conventional brick structure could. If one finds its color too garish today, it can only soften.</p><p>Instead of the residential quarters and racquetball courts of the traditional YMCA, this one has modern amenities. The wellness center has a fitness center, a spin room, and a well-appointed teaching kitchen. The gymnasium has a regulation-size basketball court, while the aquatic center has a lap pool, a family pool, and a superb steam room and sauna (which will not open until Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, at which point we can expect membership to soar).</p><p>The men's and women's locker rooms are deftly tucked between pool and gym, with entrances in either direction -- in effect, a wet side and a sweat side -- to make each of those journeys as convenient as possible. The pool is particularly well-detailed, and designed for the experience of the swimmer; there are no bulky banks of fluorescent lights, and the conventional metal air ducts that clutter the ceilings of most indoor public pools have been replaced with fabric ducts along the wall. One swims free of distraction -- just water below and a warm timber ceiling above.</p><p>YMCA is the abbreviation for Young Men's Christian Association, and traditionally its facilities had the introspective character of a private club. Not the Northeast Bronx YMCA, which presents itself as something more inclusive. A sly detail near the entrance makes that clear. The pedestrian enters by ascending a gentle ramp that runs along the south side of the wellness center. At the foot of that ramp is the community room, which is visible through a large corner window at sidewalk level. It is precisely placed to let you give a sheepish wave to the meeting you're rushing to join. Added during the course of construction, it is an inspired afterthought, and lets those using the room see the community they are discussing -- and vice versa.</p><p>So little does this building have in common with its historical prototype that we can reasonably ask if it is still a YMCA at all. But in its idealism, its sense of good-humored fellowship, its hearty concern for health in every sense of the word, it is every bit as much a YMCA as its muscular brick predecessors. After all, no two things are as unlike as a caterpillar and a butterfly, and yet they are the same animal.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lewis teaches architectural history at Williams and reviews architecture for the Journal; his latest book is \"Philadelphia Builds: Essays on Architecture\" (Paul Dry).</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
