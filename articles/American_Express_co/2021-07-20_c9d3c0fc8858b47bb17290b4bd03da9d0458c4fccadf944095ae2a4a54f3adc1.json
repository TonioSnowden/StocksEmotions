  "text": "<p>Shareholder pressure on companies including Amazon, Union Pacific and JPMorgan Chase to address race and other diversity issues has risen to record levels this year, after the Black Lives Matter movement and the pandemic focused investor attention on social challenges.</p> <p>Investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dffac98-fd4e-4288-8683-8f84e236d335\">support</a> for resolutions at annual meetings that focused on diversity, such as calling for companies to report on their workforce inclusion efforts, has soared this year, according to figures from Proxy Insight, a data provider. </p> <p>The average of investor support for diversity-related resolutions globally in the first six months of 2021 was 42.4 per cent, compared with 23.9 per cent over the whole of 2020, the data showed.</p> <p>Several such resolutions received majority support from shareholders, including proposals calling for American Express and Union Pacific to report annually on diversity efforts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Heidi Soumerai, senior environmental, social and governance adviser at Boston Trust Walden, a US asset manager, said the “extraordinary events” of the past two years had been a “main impetus for investor and corporate attention on the ‘S' in ESG, especially racial justice issues”.</p> <p>“In numerous ways, the times have exposed devastating, disproportionate impacts on people of colour, including economic and health impacts,” she added.</p> <p>Following the murder of George Floyd last year and the Black Lives Matter protests, several big asset management bosses, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e26831f-af45-43b2-856f-9db698845b27\">Larry Fink</a> at BlackRock, spoke about the need to address racial injustice in the US and across the world.</p> <p>BlackRock, BNP Paribas Asset Management and Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) were among asset managers that supported at least some diversity-focused resolutions this year, with BlackRock voting in favour at companies including Berkshire Hathaway, Union Pacific and Charter Communications. LGIM supported 21 various proposals put forward by shareholders focused on diversity in the US, including at Amazon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship for the Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management, said it had been a “historic proxy season”.</p> <p>“Events of the past year have underscored a number of critical faultlines in the US that must be repaired, and these resolutions are part of that effort. Investors are seeking to identify the corporate sector's role in addressing various forms of discrimination,” he added.</p> <p>Soumerai suggested the high levels of “for” votes at annual meetings “indicate that many large asset managers and asset owners are backing up their words in support of racial justice through their voting practices”.</p> <p>At Amazon's shareholder meeting in May, 44 per cent of investors supported a proposal calling for a racial equity audit at the company. Despite the strong showing, Vanguard, which is the company's largest shareholder after founder Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://about.vanguard.com/investment-stewardship/perspectives-and-commentary/Amazon_1673242.pdf\">said it did not support</a> the proposal.</p> <p>However, Vanguard <a href=\"https://about.vanguard.com/investment-stewardship/perspectives-and-commentary/INSAMEX_052021.pdf\">voted for</a> a diversity proposal at American Express, saying the credit card operator should disclose more about the board's role in overseeing diversity programmes.&#xa0;</p> <p>The great majority of diversity-focused resolutions this year were filed at US companies, with a small number in Canada and one in Korea, according to Proxy Insight.&#xa0;</p> <p>Diversity proponents have also compelled companies to disclose diversity statistics without a shareholder vote. For example, McDonald's and drugstore chain CVS “made really significant increases to their data disclosure” this year, prompting investors to withdraw shareholder petitions, said Meredith Benton, founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which consults investors on corporate governance.</p> <p>Investors were most successful this year in demanding that companies published basic information about their workforces — the statistics on race, ethnicity and gender that companies already provide to the US government but are not made public. Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, last year started a campaign that has led more than half of S&amp;P 100 companies to disclose this information.</p> <p>Benton said the next step was to get companies to disclose diversity information about their recruiting, retention and promotions.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/c8ce22cd-464b-4543-ae59-9746d25923a9.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Attracta Mooney in London and Patrick Temple-West in New York 2021 'Investors increase pressure on companies over racial issues' FT.com 20 July.
