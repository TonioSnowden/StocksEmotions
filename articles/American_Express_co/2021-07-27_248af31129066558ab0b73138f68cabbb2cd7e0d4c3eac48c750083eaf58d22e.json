  "title": "Credit-Card Spending Bill Will Come Due",
  "text": "<p>In recent months, many U.S. consumers were spending at levels similar to, or better than, what they were doing in the same period in the year before the pandemic began. At Capital One Financial, purchase volume on its domestic cards was up 25% in the second quarter of 2021 from what it was in the same period in 2019.</p><p>Even beleaguered travel-and-entertainment purchasing in June was up 3% versus June 2019, Capital One said Thursday. American Express reported Friday that consumer T&amp;E this June was 98% of what it was two years ago, and that across consumers and businesses, T&amp;E reached about 70% versus 2019 toward the end of the second quarter. That is a faster recovery than AmEx had been anticipating.</p><p>The downside for card companies is that, alongside that spending, consumers are paying off their cards rather than building balances that generate interest payments. Average domestic card loans at Capital One during the second quarter were down 10% from the same period in 2019. The company on Thursday said that, while payment rates were easing a bit recently, they are still running at \"really quite a breathtaking level.\"</p><p>An investor might wonder what the problem is. With credit losses correspondingly quite low and activity way up, what card loans remain are profitable. For domestic cards, net interest income plus noninterest income from spending-driven fees as a percentage of loans was higher for Capital One in the second quarter than at any point in 2019 at nearly 18%. And with many lenders having excess capital, perhaps it just makes sense to return that to shareholders and accept that people won't be borrowing much for a long time.</p><p>But an extended period of benign credit, big spending and no borrowing could generate new problems. Notably, it could encourage a lot of competition, and spenders tend to be very focused on rewards. Wells Fargo recently jump-started its cards business with a new cash-back offering and plans more.</p><p>\"Being competitive here is both an opportunity to grow but more importantly it's a strategic imperative\" for customer relationships, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charles Scharf recently told analysts. Several banks have noted a big uptick in their card marketing spending.</p><p>The danger is that rising reward givebacks can put pressure on noninterest revenue. And without the discipline of credit risk, there is pressure and a temptation to just keep adding more spenders. That can backfire if the consumers who are most at risk of financial trouble in the future are the ones who are tearing open their mail to accept generous card offers. It could make the next credit cycle more damaging.</p><p>Plus, competition for people who do borrow may intensify. This could put pressure on interest income just as it looks poised to grow from higher rates, spoiling what investors might have hoped is the payoff with card lenders. For example, American Express, known for its charge cards, said on Friday it is still looking to expand by acquiring more balances. AmEx said it was aiming to offer customers attractive revolving credit plans or personal loans to win their borrowing business. There is also the emerging buy now-pay later sector, where players are trying to get consumers to permanently change their spending and borrowing habits.</p><p>Card companies certainly are enjoying the benefits of lots of spending right now. Eventually the bill comes due.</p>",
