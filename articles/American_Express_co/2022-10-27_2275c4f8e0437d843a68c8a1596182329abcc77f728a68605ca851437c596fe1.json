  "text": "<p>The company posted $5.76 billion in revenue, up from $4.99 billion a year earlier and ahead of the $5.65 billion that analysts were anticipating.</p><p>Mastercard's headline revenue was up 15%, though the company noted that revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis.</p><p>Gross dollar volume rose 11% on a local-currency basis, while switched transactions grew 9%. Cross-border volume increased by 44%.</p><p>\"The headline is that consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover,\" Chief Executive Michael Miebach said on the company's earnings call.</p><p>He added in the company's earnings release that Mastercard \"will continue to monitor impacts related to elevated inflation and other macroeconomic and geopolitical risks,\" though he said that the company's \"diversified business model and ability to modulate expenses position [it] well to navigate through periods of uncertainty while maintaining focus on our strategic objectives.\"</p><p>Mastercard's fourth-quarter outlook calls for revenue growth at the low end of low double digits on a GAAP basis. The forecast also models GAAP operating expense growth at the low end of low double digits.</p><p>Mastercard shares were down 1.5% in Thursday morning action.</p><p>\"The nominal 4Q guidance falling below consensus may hurt the stock today,\" Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev wrote. \"However, we believe that there is nothing wrong with being prudent. Visa noted recession worries but kept an overly upbeat guide.\"</p><p>Mastercard's earnings follow those from Visa Inc. V earlier in the week. Visa's CFO told MarketWatch Tuesday that the company saw \"no evidence of consumers feeling a pinch\" in its latest results. American Express Co. AXP similarly called out strong spending trends when it posted results late last week.</p><p>Visa just began its new fiscal year and offered an outlook for high-single-digit revenue growth for the period. That forecast doesn't bake in a recession scenario, but even so, some analysts thought it might be conservative.</p><p>Mizuho's Dolev wrote that Mastercard's \"October trends look a little more upbeat versus Visa as U.S. switched volumes accelerated vs. being largely flat at Visa.\"</p><p>Mastercard earnings show spending remains strong</p>",
