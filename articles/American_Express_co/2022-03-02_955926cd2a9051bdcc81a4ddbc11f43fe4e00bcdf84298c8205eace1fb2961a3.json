  "text": "<p>\"Our hybrid model balances the best of being together in person and being anywhereâ€”where teams can intentionally come together to collaborate and connect in the office, and spend the other days working from wherever best suits their needs,\" Mr. Casey told employees.</p><p>Google said it is requiring Covid-19 vaccines for employees working from company offices, with approved accommodations exempted. The company won't require face masks to be worn in offices by fully vaccinated employees.</p><p>Google's announced plan comes as companies across industries are gearing up for broader office reopenings as Covid-19 cases drop and health authorities loosen Covid restrictions. While many executives say they are uncertain about what the future may hold, they say they are at least feeling confident that offices can soon reopen.</p><p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., American Express Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. are among companies that are planning broader office reopenings this month. Many companies are preaching flexibility, letting specific teams and managers decide when and how often employees come to the office with the aim of not alienating the segment of employees who appreciate the benefits of working from home.</p><p>Google, like other companies, had previously delayed its recent return-to-office plans amid the Omicron variant and rising case counts.</p><p>In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai preached the benefits of flexibility when asked about the future of the office.</p><p>\"We do think it's important to get people in a few days a week, but we are embracing all options,\" he said. \"I think we can be more purposeful about the time they're in, making sure group meetings or collaboration, creative collaborative brainstorming or community building, happens then.\"</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Google Sets Its Return to Office Plans for April 4</p>",
