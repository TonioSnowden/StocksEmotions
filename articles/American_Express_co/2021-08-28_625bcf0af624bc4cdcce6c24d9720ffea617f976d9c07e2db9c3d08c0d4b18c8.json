  "text": "<p>   That meant setting a much higher bar for government or judicial action. For Bork, many common antitrust complaints should simply disappear. He dismissed the idea that vertical integration could undermine competition. He derided the concept of \"predatory pricing\" -- the notion that firms might monopolize a market by taking losses with low prices -- for prohibiting basic competitive practices. Bork felt that antitrust should largely be restricted to challenging the biggest horizontal mergers -- combinations of direct competitors -- and the most egregious anticompetitive practices, such as explicit price fixing. </p><p>   His arguments soon transformed the debate. Forty years after publication, \"The Antitrust Paradox\" had been cited in more than 150 federal court rulings, including 18 Supreme Court opinions by 10 different justices. In 1982 Ronald Reagan placed Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, while the Reagan administration's antitrust enforcers scrapped Johnson's 1968 merger guidelines. They were replaced with more flexible parameters based on Borkian economic analysis, trying to determine whether such combinations could really be shown to cause economic harm. By 1992, Democrats had dropped antitrust and any mention of monopoly from their party platform for the first time since the Progressive Era. </p><p>   A vivid illustration of Bork's victory over Brandeis came in the 2003 case of Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Trinko. The telecom company was accused of illegal \"exclusionary conduct,\" refusing to give rivals access to its network infrastructure. The court rejected the claim. Justice Antonin Scalia -- a colleague of Bork's on the D.C. Circuit and a fellow originalist -- struck directly at Justice Douglas's argument that monopoly is inherently evil, writing in his ruling that \"the mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system.\" The opinion was joined by liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. </p><p>   In the 21st century the U.S. once again entered a period of economic angst, marked by the recession of 2008-09 and a long slow recovery. Inequality of income and wealth reached the scale of the 19th-century Gilded Age, which gave rise to the Progressive Era. </p><p>   The rapid rise to dominance of the big tech giants offered consumers infinite new conveniences. But it also fostered widespread disruptions to economic, social and political systems. Big business faced a populist backlash from left and right. Ms. Khan helped to channel the uprising with a 2017 essay in the Yale Law Journal titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" a riposte to Bork. She argued that the online marketplace had undermined the theories and assumptions of his influential book. </p><p>   As Democrats retook power over the past three years -- the House in 2018, the Senate and White House in 2020 -- they turned to the New Brandeis school to shape antitrust strategy. Ms. Khan was hired in 2019 as counsel to the House antitrust committee. She helped to run a high-profile investigation of the big tech companies and to write a 449-page report outlining the ways they had supposedly evaded antitrust enforcement and suggesting strategies for curbing their market clout. The report cites a Brandeis quotation as its guiding spirit: \"We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.\" In June, the Senate confirmed Ms. Khan to join the FTC by a 69-28 vote, with 21 Republicans backing her. </p><p>   In March, Mr. Biden tapped Mr. Wu -- author of the 2018 New Brandeis manual, \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\" -- to craft competition policy. Mr. Wu helped to write a July executive order that included 72 actions by more than a dozen agencies aimed at restraining big business, in sectors ranging from tech and banking to airlines and agriculture. The order called for a review of the flexible Reagan-era merger guidelines, with an eye toward possibly restoring more concrete rules. </p><p>   In July, the administration nominated Mr. Kanter as assistant attorney general for antitrust, and he awaits Senate confirmation. As head of a boutique law firm, he has led private suits against big tech companies and helped a number of states and the federal government launch a complaint against Google last year. (He has also represented News Corp., the parent company of The Wall Street Journal). </p><p>   While the neo-Brandeisians are influential in the legislative and executive branches, they will struggle unless they also win over the judiciary. The courts have considerable sway in antitrust, because the original Sherman Act was vague, and judges have claimed great discretion interpreting it. As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a 1978 opinion, \"the legislative history makes it perfectly clear that [Congress] expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad mandate.\" </p><p>   So far, there's no evidence that the Brandeis view is gaining traction in a court system filled with judges trained in Borkian principles. The Supreme Court has continued to further restrict antitrust enforcement powers. In Ohio v. American Express Co. in 2018, a 5-4 court rebuffed a complaint from the Justice Department and more than a dozen states accusing the credit card issuer of abusing its dominant market power to prevent merchants from steering customers to rival card companies. </p><p>   During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch interrupted the Ohio state solicitor making the case against AmEx. \"We're not here to protect competitors right?\" Justice Gorsuch asked, in classic Bork mode. \"The antitrust laws are aimed at protecting consumers; you'd agree with that?\" </p><p></p>",
