  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Adventure & Travel:  The Airport Sanctuary, Reclaimed  ---  Airline lounges once offered a quiet refuge from chaos. No longer. But there are some bright spots -- from clubs  within clubs to private terminals -- for those willing to pay a premium. We survey jetsetters for their top picks.  ----  By Barbara Peterson",
  "text": "<p>\n  In the 1963 movie \"The VIPs,\" a well-heeled group of travelers, portrayed by an all-star cast featuring Richard Burton and a bejeweled Liz Taylor, gets stranded at a fogged-in London Heathrow Airport. Inevitable dramas ensue. But the flick's real star is the airport lounge where the swells hole up. Modest by today's standards, it lacks spas and lavish buffets but still reeks of exclusivity, with fawning attendants fetching telephones and plying guests with cocktails. This was an era when airport lounges were posh simply because they were invitation-only. </p><p>\n  Today, lounges are ubiquitous, and you don't need an engraved invitation to get in, just the right kind of ticket, paid membership or credit card. Originally conceived as a quiet space for travelers to work or grab a drink before a flight, the concept took off in the mid-1970s after the federal government deemed the airlines' lounge policies discriminatory and required carriers to open up the clubs to anyone who could pay. Frequent-flier programs and branded credit cards began offering lounge access as a perk. An estimated 3,000 lounges now populate major airports worldwide, according to LoungeReview.com. </p><p>\n  But are these airport oases really worth the price of entry? Complaints about overcrowding soared last summer, as travel rebounded and scenes of long queues outside airport clubs went viral. \"There's something wrong when people are lining up like it's Studio 54,\" said Gary Leff, founder of the air travel website View From the Wing. </p><p>\n  To cut down on congestion, some clubs are setting limits on the duration of your stay and the number of guests you can bring in. For example, Delta Sky Clubs now limit stays to no more than three hours before scheduled departure. And starting in February, American Express, which has its own network of Centurion lounges, will charge cardholders $50 for each guest unless they put $75,000 or more on their cards each year. A few airlines have stopped selling day passes at some popular clubs. Needless to say, these moves have not gone over well with harried travelers. </p><p>\n  One solution to the lounge crunch is to build more lounges. During the pandemic, some lounges were closed and many airlines used the downtime to refurbish their airport digs, or to build new ones, said Ty Osbaugh, co-lead of the aviation practice at Gensler architecture firm. \"Lounges are probably the number one priority now for airports,\" said Mr. Osbaugh, who worked on Delta new Terminal C at New York's LaGuardia Airport and new terminals at Pittsburgh International Airport. </p><p>\n  For now, the traveling public has two options: endure the big squeeze or seek out the few remaining patches of true serenity, still accessible but at a price. At many of these extra-exclusive lounges, you'll likely need a first-class ticket or elite status to get in (for mileage junkies that's not beyond reach). At some clubs, premium credit cards can also grant you access. Here's what travel insiders consider the top lounge amenities -- and where you can find them: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Traveling Incognito </p><p>\n  \"It's all about privacy,\" said Jack Ezon, founder of travel company Embark Beyond. He and other luxury-travel advisers say that one of their most common requests from clients during this past turbulent summer travel season was some form of pampering and an escape from the crush at the terminal. </p><p>\n  For those willing to pay for privacy, Mr. Ezon recommends the PS Lounge (for \"Private Suite\") at LAX, which is actually a separate terminal with individual suites and amenities like private TSA and Customs screenings (prices start at $695 for members and $995 for nonmembers; annual memberships start at $1,250). </p><p>\n  London's Heathrow has its Windsor Suite which, if \"The VIPs\" were remade today, would probably be where the nabobs would be hiding out, with private rooms, individual security screenings and meals curated by a Michelin-starred chef. Rates start at around $3,000 for a group of three. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Park and Fly </p><p>\n  In Dubai, where the Emirates Airline's First Class Lounge takes up an entire floor of an airport terminal, fliers can simply waltz onto their flight when it's called from one of the 30-plus gates. At 100,000 square feet, with space for 1,000 guests, it's been billed as the world's largest first-class airport club, and the time you save not having to cool your heels at the gate can be spent shopping at one of the in-lounge duty free boutiques, sipping a glass of Cabernet in the wine-tasting room or eating a multicourse meal in a sit-down restaurant. Emirates business-class passengers in can also board flights directly from their lounge in Concourse A, as can -- starting this week -- Delta Sky Club members who are flying through Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 5. </p><p>\n  Some airlines will drive you straight from the club to the plane: At Lufthansa's First-Class terminal at Frankfurt, fliers descend to the tarmac via an elevator when their flight is called, and then hop into a chauffeur-driven car. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A Fresh Start </p><p>\n  For some fliers, the best lounge perks are better savored after a flight. In Dubai, Jumeirah Hotels, the luxury chain best known for its striking Burj Al Arab tower, guests of that hotel and other U.A.E properties who have pre-booked transfers can head straight to Jumeirah's airport lounge upon arrival. Changing rooms, showers and a restaurant-worthy meal await; a car will take them to their hotel when their room is ready. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Room to Primp and Snooze </p><p>\n  At Air France's La Premiere First Class Lounge in Paris, the Sisley spa serves up facials and massages. First-class fliers on Swiss, cooling their heels at Zurich Airport, can avail themselves of two \"hotel rooms,\" with upscale bedding and en-suite bathrooms. You can also get your beauty sleep at Singapore's First Class Lounge at Changi Airport in one of the nap rooms in an exclusive space dubbed the Private Room. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  All Decked Out </p><p>\n  Some lounges offer the most basic cure for claustrophobia of all -- fresh air. Take Delta Sky Clubs, many of which have outdoor Sky Decks, a combination patio and observation zone for plane spotting. At LAX, home to one of Delta's newest and biggest spaces, the deck has a retractable roof and heaters so it can be enjoyed in any weather. At Swiss's Zurich lounge, passengers can wait out layovers on a terrace with views of the Alps. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  FLIGHT CLUB / A FEW MILESTONES IN THE HISTORY OF AIRPORT LOUNGES </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1939: American Airlines opens the invitation-only Admirals Club, in New York City. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1950s: The era of the \"VIP\" airport lounge takes off as Pan Am and TWA, among other airlines, open their own lounges. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1974: The Civil Aeronautics Board bans discrimination in clubs, issuing a decision ordering airlines to open clubs to anyone who pays the membership fee or is traveling in a specific class of service. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1976: British Airways launches Concorde flights followed by Concorde-only lounges in London's Heathrow and New York's Kennedy airports. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1992: Priority Pass introduces global network of airport lounges offering access to members for an annual fee. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2013: American Express opens its first Centurion Club at Las Vegas McCarran Airport. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2016: Chase Sapphire Reserve credit cards joins American Express premium cards in offering access to Priority Pass, soon flooding lounges with new members. </p><p></p>",
