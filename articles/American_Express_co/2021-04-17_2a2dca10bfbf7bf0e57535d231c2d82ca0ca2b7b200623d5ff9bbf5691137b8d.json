  "text": "<p>   Harvey Golub's \"Politics Is Risky Business for CEOs\" (op-ed, April 13) is right -- on principle and in practice. Taking positions on public policy is not a CEO's job (unless it affects the business), and it is tricky to execute. </p><p>   At Ogilvy &amp; Mather, we did not accept political clients. First, it is divisive; not everyone would agree with backing that candidate. Second, it is disruptive; political campaigns are work-intensive for short periods and disrupt work for other clients. Third, campaigns are notorious for not paying their bills. </p><p>   But we encouraged our people to engage with politics as citizens. Talented creative directors at our agency, on their own time, created campaigns for Richard Nixon (\"Nixon's the One\") and Ronald Reagan (\"It's Morning Again in America\") as well as Bobby Kennedy. I was a low-level advance man for Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign. The principle is the same as that articulated by Mr. Golub: We have obligations as citizens, not as corporations. </p><p>   Kenneth Roman </p><p>   New York </p><p>   Mr. Roman is former chairman and CEO of Ogilvy &amp; Mather. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Golub writes that \"it is wrong for executives to take a company position on public-policy questions that don't directly affect their business.\" I am more concerned with the executives who haven't taken a position. </p><p>   Send out a search party for the last time CEOs took a strong public position supporting free-market capitalism, unless it affected them personally. They free-ride, believing that others will make the case against the growing political and cultural trend of discrediting capitalism. Credit the liberals this time for knowing which invertebrates are easiest to shame. </p><p>   Brian Klippenstein </p><p>   Platte City, Mo. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Delta CEO Edward Bastian would do well to read and listen to the advice of Mr. Golub. My 43 years as an American Express card holder were validated with his well-thought-out article. I've advised Mr. Bastian that I've canceled six tickets and rebooked with another airline. I'm doubtful he cares but I'll bet his shareholders will when thousands of Delta Frequent Flyers do the same. </p><p>   Daniel W. Richards </p><p>   Ontario, Calif. </p><p></p>",
