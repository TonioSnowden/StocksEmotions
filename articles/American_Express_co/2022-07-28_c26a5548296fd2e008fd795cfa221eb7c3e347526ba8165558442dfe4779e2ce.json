  "text": "<p>After adjustments, Mastercard MA earned $2.56 a share in the quarter, up from $1.95 a share a year prior, while analysts were projecting $2.36 a share.</p><p>Revenue at Mastercard rose to $5.50 billion from $4.53 billion and came in above the FactSet consensus, which was for $5.27 billion.</p><p>\"Increasing inflationary pressures have yet to significantly impact overall consumer spending but we will continue to monitor this closely,\" Chief Executive Michael Miebach said in a release. \"We have a well-diversified business model and the demonstrated ability to deliver strong operating margins through up and down cycles.\"</p><p>He called consumer-spending trends \"robust.\"</p><p>Gross dollar volume increased 14% on a local-currency basis in the second quarter, while cross-border volume was up 58%. Mastercard reported 12% growth in switched transactions.</p><p>Mastercard's results come on the heels of upbeat reports from American Express Co. AXP and Visa Inc. V over the past few days. Amex's CFO told MarketWatch that the company was seeing \"no signs of any stress from a credit perspective,\" while Visa's CFO said on an earnings call that the company had seen \"no evidence of a pullback\" in consumer spending.</p><p>Both Visa and Mastercard have gotten some recent attention after The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that senators were considering proposing card-routing legislation that would seek to give merchants the option of processing credit transactions through an \"unaffiliated\" network that was different than whichever of Visa or Mastercard was listed on a given card.</p><p>Such a bill has yet to be introduced, however, and even if it were, analysts were unsure whether it would be a major priority or win enough favor to pass.</p><p>Mastercard earnings top expectations amid 'robust' spending</p>",
