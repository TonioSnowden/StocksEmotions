  "title": "Amex shrugs off macro fears with huge earnings beat powered by strong spending; Card giant boosts revenue outlook, says credit trends remain 'exceptional'",
  "text": "<p>American Express AXP recorded $13.4 billion in total revenues net of interest expense in the quarter, whereas analysts had been looking for $12.51 billion. The company had posted $10.24 billion in revenue during its year-earlier quarter. Amex attributed the boost largely to higher card spending.</p><p>The stock ran up 5.0% in premarket trading.</p><p>\"We have been able to deliver exceptional results while navigating a complex macroeconomic environment because of a number of factors, including the scale and strength of our global customer base, the decisions we made through the pandemic and recovery to support our customers and seize on growth opportunities, and our continued focus on enhancing our value propositions and bringing new customers into the franchise,\" Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in a release.</p><p>The company recognized a 30% boost in card-member spending on a currency-neutral basis. Amex also saw the addition of 3.2 million new proprietary cards during the latest period. Acquisitions of U.S. consumer Platinum and Gold cards, along with the Delta Air Lines DAL co-branded card, notched all-time highs.</p><p>Amex saw benefits from the \"robust rebound\" in travel and entertainment spending during the second quarter, as consumers continue to leave their homes and spend up on experiences after holding back on such activity earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>The company disclosed $410 million in consolidated provisions for credit losses in the quarter, whereas it saw a $606 million benefit on the metric a year before. \"The change primarily reflected a small net reserve build in the current quarter compared with a $866 million reserve release a year ago,\" Amex noted in its release, but the company maintained an upbeat view on credit trends.</p><p>\"Our credit performance remains exceptional, with delinquencies and write-offs near historical lows,\" Squeri shared.</p><p>Amex now expects 23% to 25% revenue growth for the full year, compared with its prior forecast, which called for 18% to 20% growth. The company is sticking with its previous forecast for $9.25 to $9.65 in earnings per share.</p><p>Amex disclosed earlier in the year that it was targeting annual revenue growth upwards of 10% in 2024 and beyond. The company also said it was looking to grow annual EPS at a mid-teens rate over the long run.</p><p>Shares of Amex have dropped 17% over the past three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has slipped 5%.</p><p>Amex shrugs off macro fears with huge earnings beat powered by strong spending</p>",
