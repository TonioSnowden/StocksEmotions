  "title": "Technology:  Meta Names Doordash  CEO Tony Xu to Board  ----  By Salvador Rodriguez",
  "text": "<p>    Facebook company Meta Platforms Inc. on Tuesday appointed Doordash Inc. Chief Executive Tony Xu to its board of directors, adding outside executive experience to a group that has been criticized for its lack of independence. </p><p>   Mr. Xu's appointment is the first change to the board since the company rebranded itself as Meta in October. It is also the first addition to the board since the departure of Jeffrey Zients, who chose not to seek re-election to the company's board in March 2020. Mr. Zients was succeeded by Robert Kimmitt, a lawyer and former deputy secretary to the Department of the Treasury during the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Kimmitt is the lead independent director. </p><p>    Mark Zuckerberg is Meta's chairman and CEO and controls the majority of the company's voting stock through supervoting shares. The majority of Meta's outside shareholders in recent years have voted to separate those roles, which the company has rejected, and some investors have said they believe the board is too beholden to Mr. Zuckerberg. </p><p>   Several directors with significant executive experience, including Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and former American Express Inc. CEO Kenneth Chenault, have left the board in recent years. </p><p>   Mr. Xu brings experience running one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing companies. He co-founded DoorDash as a student at Stanford University in 2013. The 37-year-old worked as a dish washer in his mother's Chinese restaurant after emigrating to the U.S. as a child, and drew on some of those learnings during his early days at DoorDash. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Preetika Rana contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
