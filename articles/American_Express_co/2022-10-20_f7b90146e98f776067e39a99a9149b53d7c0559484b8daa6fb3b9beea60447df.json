  "title": "This Powerful BlackRock Team Has the Ear of Governments and Megabanks; The company's financial markets advisory team dispenses counsel to the Fed, the Vatican and the Ukrainian president, among others",
  "text": "<p>\"We've shown that we know how to win on the battlefield,\" Mr. Zelensky said in a press release after the meeting. \"Another important task for us is to achieve victories in the economy as well, and to be an attractive country for investors.\"</p><p>The conversation was another case of BlackRock and Mr. Fink playing a role on the world stage and in sticky political situations.</p><p>BlackRock is the world's largest financial adviser, and millions of people are invested in the stock market through its index-tracking funds. A crack team inside the firm has a different sort of mandate: It counsels heads of state, central banks and financial institutions in times of crisis.</p><p>The team, the blandly named financial markets advisory group, offers risk analysis, stress tests and asset valuation to clients like the European Central Bank, the government of Greece and big U.S. banks.</p><p>The team helped the Federal Reserve organize the emergency sale of Bear Stearns in 2008, and the U.S. central bank's aggressive pandemic bond-buying in 2020. It worked with the Vatican to get its portfolio in compliance with regulatory requirements in the early 2010s, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>A few years ago, when the Romanian government approached the team to ask for help setting up a sovereign-wealth fund, BlackRock employees told officials they would need to take politics out of the process, according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock's involvement in the proposed fund ended soon after, they said.</p><p>Sometimes, it is Mr. Fink himself at the table. Trusted advisers, including Mark Wiedman—a potential successor to Mr. Fink—are team alums. Some of the team's leaders came from high-level jobs in government. The former head of the Swiss National Bank was once the team's chairman.</p><p>The team \"helps us connect at a time of crisis,\" said Mr. Fink in an interview. \"It's near and dear to me because I actually believe we're serving a purpose.\"</p><p>The team isn't without controversy. Its work with the Fed's Covid-19 bond-buying program was a particular flashpoint. Rivals and industry analysts said it could give BlackRock, the largest provider of bond ETFs, a unique advantage. Many of the funds investors poured into were BlackRock's own.</p><p>The Fed said at the time that it chose BlackRock's team after considering its expertise, experience and \"robust operational and technological capabilities.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also released new disclosures to reduce BlackRock's chances of profiting unfairly from its contracts with the U.S. government.</p><p>The Fed agreed to pay BlackRock $3 million for the first six months of work, and $750,000 for any quarter after that.</p><p>That Fed project ended in October of last year, according to BlackRock.</p><p>\"It surprised some people that the Fed, which is composed of many smart people, economists, would necessarily need outside advice,\" said Itamar Drechsler, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies the effects of central bank policies. \"They could say there wasn't exactly time to build in-house capacity, which I agree with—but my guess moving forward is that they would then want to build expertise from within.\"</p><p>The main concern about this team, said Mr. Drechsler, would be whether it keeps client information out of the hands of BlackRock's investment teams.</p><p>Executives emphasized that, in all its work, the team operates separately from the rest of the house. It sits on the 14th floor, separate from any investment teams. Outside auditors review the team's controls to ensure there is a firewall between it and the rest of the firm—and clients can as well.</p><p>In 2014, the Dutch national bank hired the BlackRock team to help it review the health of the country's banks. BlackRock employees were instructed to not enter BlackRock's Amsterdam offices, according to two former employees on the project.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think BlackRock's financial markets advisory team might help Ukraine? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The team is relatively small, about 250 people in a firm of 18,400 employees. It also isn't exactly a moneymaker, at least by BlackRock standards. In the third quarter, all of BlackRock's advisory services brought in $35 million, or 0.8% of total revenue. BlackRock declined to say how much of that comes from the financial markets advisory team. Mr. Fink offered its services to Ukraine pro bono, though normally its fees vary depending on the project.</p><p>BlackRock executives said that because the firm is an asset manager, largely overseeing money for others, it has fewer potential conflicts of interest with clients. It also owns stakes in more than 14,000 companies worldwide and regularly assesses their risk profiles. The firm says that gives it special insight into problems like failing banks or hard-to-value assets.</p><p>\"When we walk in the door versus another kind of consulting party, people say, 'You know, that is a business that lives and breathes capital markets,'\" said Brandon Hall, a Fed veteran who co-runs the business day-to-day with Ben Leax. Mr. Hall and Mr. Leax report to Charles Hatami.</p><p>The BlackRock team was officially created in 2008, but crisis work is in the firm's DNA.</p><p>In 1994, about six years after Mr. Fink co-founded the firm, General Electric Co. needed help cleaning up a bond-trading scandal at its Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. subsidiary. A rogue bond trader allegedly created bogus profits, triggering GE's decision to sell Kidder's mortgage-backed bonds and other assets.</p><p>GE was a client of BlackRock's at the time. Its then-CEO, Jack Welch, asked Mr. Fink for help in valuing and selling Kidder's assets.</p><p>\"The only other people that could have remotely done this work would have been conflicted competitors of Kidder,\" Mr. Leax said.</p><p>More-recent private-sector clients have included State Street Corp., Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and Fifth Third Bancorp, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The majority of that work involved the Fed stress tests, exams that judge whether the banks can survive a severe downturn, those people said. The team has also helped banks meet U.S. anti-money-laundering regulations.</p><p>After the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in 2016, the European Central Bank hired the BlackRock team to conduct stress tests on dozens of European financial institutions, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The team examined three Italian banks and determined that Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA was the least affected by bad loans, according to people familiar with the matter. Several months later, the Italian government decided to nationalize and save MPS. The other two were wound down.</p><p>Write to Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com</p><p>This Powerful BlackRock Team Has the Ear of Governments and Megabanks</p>",
