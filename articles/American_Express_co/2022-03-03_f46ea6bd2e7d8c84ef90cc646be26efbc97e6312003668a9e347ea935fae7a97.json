  "title": "Technology:  Google  Sets Its  Return to  Office for  April 4  ----  By Omar Abdel-Baqui",
  "text": "<p>    Alphabet Inc.'s Google outlined its return-to-office plans on Wednesday, saying it is transitioning to a hybrid work model that will bring employees back to U.S. offices at least a few days a week starting the week of April 4. </p><p>   In an email to staff, the company said it is ending its voluntary work-from-home phase at its San Francisco-area offices and several other U.S. locations. </p><p>   Most employees will spend roughly three days in the office and two days working where they choose, John Casey, vice president of global benefits at Google, wrote to employees. </p><p>   \"Our hybrid model balances the best of being together in person and being anywhere -- where teams can intentionally come together to collaborate and connect in the office, and spend the other days working from wherever best suits their needs,\" Mr. Casey told employees. </p><p>   Google said it is requiring Covid-19 vaccines for employees working from company offices, with approved accommodations exempted. </p><p>   The company won't require face masks to be worn in offices by fully vaccinated employees. </p><p>   Google's announced plan comes as companies across industries are gearing up for broader office reopenings as Covid-19 cases drop and health authorities loosen Covid restrictions. </p><p>   While many executives say they are uncertain about what the future may hold, they say they are at least feeling confident that offices can soon reopen. </p><p>    Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., American Express Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. are among companies that are planning broader office reopenings this month. </p><p></p>",
