Markets had been \"very firmly\" pricing in a 75-basis point hike in December, as well as next month, she said</p><p>While the U.S. central bank appears set to again lift its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point at its policy meeting in early November, there may be some debate among Fed officials over whether to hike rates by 50 basis points in December.</p><p>\"That is the first step in what we call the beginning of the end,\" said Mahajan. \"Over time we'd expect the pace of rate hikes to slow,\" followed by a pause at some point, and then an assessment of where inflation and the economy are heading, she said.</p><p>Fed funds futures traders on Friday priced in a lower probability of a 75 basis-point hike in December, with odds falling to less than 50% from 75% before the report, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury yields took a break from their recent climb, helping to take some of the pressure off stocks.
