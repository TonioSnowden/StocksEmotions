  "title": "Restaurant Reservations Are So Hot, Some Places Have a 1,000-Person Waiting List; Demand for dining out is up and wait lists are growing, but there are tricks to landing a table",
  "text": "<p>\"People are really planning ahead for that meal out,\" says Debby Soo, chief executive of OpenTable, a restaurant-reservation company owned by Booking Holdings Inc.</p><p>Some of those who used to walk in last minute now prefer to secure their spot ahead of time, leaving even fewer slots available, she says. Walk-in traffic has dropped 8%, while online reservations grew by 9% from January through June of this year compared with the same period in 2019, according to OpenTable data. Las Vegas, Miami, Austin, Texas, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Naples, Fla., are seeing double-digit increases compared with the same time in 2019. Overall, seated reservations in September climbed 9% compared with last year.</p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, many consumers are less willing to spontaneously dine out and prefer certainty in their plans, restaurateurs say. And as restaurant traffic rebounds to prepandemic numbers, a higher portion of diners is booking online reservations.</p><p>Consumers are experimenting with different strategies to get the meal they want.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you land a table at a popular restaurant? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In San Francisco, diner Tim Kim says with reservations that disappear in minutes, he often books times that are convenient and figures out who will join him later. Mr. Kim also scours restaurant newsletters and Instagram accounts for hints about particular reservation processes. Many restaurants that he follows post last-minute cancellations on social media. He has also noticed that booking a four-person table can be easier than a two-person table.</p><p>\"As food nerds, we have a little bit of an edge,\" the 34-year-old product designer says.</p><p>Jon Landsman, 53, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Ill., says he has had luck walking in to restaurants to book reservations weeks in advance. He tries some Chicago and Boston restaurants more than a month ahead of time—well before the reservations open up online. He has noticed that since the pandemic began, many of his favorite restaurants have stopped answering the phone.</p><p>\"Coming out of Covid, everything has gotten more difficult,\" says Mr. Landsman, a commercial real-estate agent.</p><p>Some restaurants are rethinking their strategies to better accommodate demand for reservations. </p><p>At Boia De in Miami, reservations fill up quickly and are only accepted online.

With staffing difficult, the restaurant has given workers raises, but it is taking roughly three months to fill one position, he says. After a 10-month wait as a result of staffing issues, Boia De recently opened seven days a week to better meet demand, but still doesn't serve lunch, he says.</p><p>The restaurant is also being more transparent about how diners can get a reservation. When it opened in 2019, the staff would accept emails and calls requesting reservations. Now it is done strictly via Resy. The restaurant also periodically posts notifications via social media to remind guests that reservations open at noon 30 days in advance. Many diners set alerts to log on at that time. \"We want to make sure the process is fair,\" Mr. Meyer says. </p><p>Flour + Water in San Francisco now has more diners booking reservations ahead of time. PHOTO: THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, ISTOCK; Krescent Carasso</p><p>Flour + Water, a San Francisco restaurant, is also moving away from more-casual reservations. After seeing an increase in reservations on days that traditionally served more walk-ins, including dinner Sunday through Wednesday, the restaurant made its communal dining table available only by reservation this spring, director of operations Amanda Flores says. \"People are not trying to hang out and wait for a table,\" she says.</p><p>Diners booking reservations are getting savvier. More people are using Resy's notify feature, which alerts diners of openings, Resy CEO Alexander Lee says. Many are also logging on 24 hours before they want to dine—when Resy asks diners to confirm their reservation and when some can cancel before incurring fees. Resy, which is owned by American Express Co., says seated diners were up 75% in July compared with January, as a result of increased demand as Covid-19 cases eased and with more users and restaurants using the service.</p><p>Restaurateurs worry that the lack of reservations can harm repeat business or turn off the kind of neighborhood regulars who kept restaurants going throughout the pandemic and in slower seasons. At FIG, a Charleston, S.C., restaurant popular with tourists and locals, online booking systems \"alienate the older crowd\" and some less tech-savvy regulars who want to stop in, co-owner Adam Nemirow says. To accommodate last-minute diners, he holds back some reservations during prime-time hours.</p><p>Some walk-ins still swear by the strategy. Nelson Billington, a 26-year-old who works in hotel sales in Charleston, recently uploaded his photo to his Resy account and added a short bio that mentions he used to work in the industry. When walking in to get on a wait list, he also tries to appear extra enthusiastic and courteous about dining there. \"It's like I have a minute to make a good impression,\" he says. (Mr. Billington says he regularly lines up 15 minutes before FIG opens at 5.p.m. to get a spot at the bar.) </p><p>Saint Theo's in New York's West Village saves 70% of its seats for regulars and walk-ins. PHOTO: THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, ISTOCK; Rebecca Fondren</p><p>At Saint Theo's in New York's West Village, partner Kyle Hotchkiss Carone splits 70% of the seats between walk-ins and regulars, leaving 30% available online. Online reservations at the Italian restaurant now have waiting lists of more than 1,500 people on weekend nights. \"I don't shy away from that. Of course we give reservations to regulars,\" he says.</p><p>Sonia Hendrix, a 36-year-old New York publicist, swears by the old-school approach. To up her chances of reservations, she is dining out at the same places in hopes of becoming a regular. When she visits her neighborhood spots, she tips well and asks for contact information so she can reach out directly to secure her reservation. Most recently, that has meant corresponding with staff to get a reservation at Carbone, a longtime celebrity hot spot in New York.</p><p>\"I really enjoy a restaurant experience where the staff knows you, and vice versa,\" Ms. Hendrix says.</p><p>Write to Alina Dizik at Alina.Dizik@wsj.com</p><p>Restaurant Reservations Are So Hot, Some Places Have a 1,000-Person Waiting List</p>",
