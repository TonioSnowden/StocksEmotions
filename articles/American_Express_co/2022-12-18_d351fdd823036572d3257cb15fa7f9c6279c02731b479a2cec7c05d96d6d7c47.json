  "text": "<p>Traditionally, etiquette dictates that it is rude to talk about money. But money underpins our post-pandemic work lives. From cost of living and inflation woes to pay equity campaigns, the Great Reshuffle, the war for talent, and employees choosing to work remotely from affordable regions — it's become impossible to not talk about money when we talk about work.</p> <p>Younger workers in particular have challenged longstanding taboos that deterred older generations from discussing pay openly. And while some employers might worry that better pay transparency will shift the balance of power away from bosses, some experts think that it will make workplaces better for everyone in the long run.</p> <p>The transparency movement is growing. In New York City, all job listings posted since November 1 have to show a salary range. A recent study conducted by Willis Towers Watson found that many organisations are disclosing pay <a href=\"https://www.wtwco.com/en-US/News/2022/09/more-north-american-organizations-plan-to-disclose-pay-information-survey-finds\">even when it is not required by law</a>. Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, notes a “spillover” effect, where there has been a “modest uptick” in employers sharing salaries in the regions surrounding New York.</p> <p>Some companies — <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/haxuco_the-nyc-salary-transparency-law-that-took-activity-6993566866778521600-enBM/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">including Amazon, American Express and Macy's</a> — are technically complying with New York legislation, but have been criticised for posting salary ranges that are too broad. However, Zhao adds that “by and large, [posted salary ranges] are relatively narrow”.</p> <p>New York is one of a number of US states to implement such laws. Colorado's Wage Transparency Act went into effect at the beginning of last year, and requires job postings to include a salary range. California governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2022/2022-10-05-californias-broad-pay-transparency-law-takes-effect-next-year\">signed a wage transparency bill</a> to take effect in the state in January 2023, and Washington state has revised its equal pay act to require the disclosure of salary range information, also from January 2023. Together, these laws will cover a fifth of American workers. However the legislation does not apply to other forms of pay or benefits, such as cash bonuses or the ability to work remotely.</p> <p>The pandemic sparked a wave of employees feeling undervalued and underpaid, which “pulled back the veil” on pay, says Tobi Oluwole, who runs 3Skills, a professional development service to help people get higher-paying jobs. Ian White, chief executive of ChartHop, a people analytics tool, says he has also seen the pandemic accelerate conversations about pay.</p> <p>The current cost of living and inflationary crisis has only intensified this. The UK's Office for National Statistics reports that growth in regular pay (not including bonuses) <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/october2022\">fell in real terms by 2.9</a> per cent — when adjusted for inflation — between June and August 2022.</p> <p>If workers can't get rises from their current employer, it is possible they will look elsewhere. According to a report by Theta Global Advisors, an accounting consultancy, 29 per cent of workers say they are actively looking for another job with higher pay. One survey found that 68 per cent of workers would move to an employer with better salary transparency, <a href=\"https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Visier-Pay-Transparency-Report.pdf\">even if their own pay remained the same</a>.</p> <p>Spencer Knibbe, chief executive of MBK Search, a recruitment agency, says that the rollout of legally required salary range disclosure in New York has had some adverse effects for employers, such as existing staff demanding rises or even threatening to leave when they see salary information in job ads posted by their employer.</p> <p>While the pay transparency movement might cause a short-term spike in staff turnover, Zhao believes it will ultimately lead to “better matches in the long term”, and will make the hiring process more efficient. A candidate and a recruiter will no longer have to go through an entire interview process only to realise their salary expectations are misaligned.</p> <p>New York's law was originally slated to take effect last spring, but was pushed back to allow companies to conduct internal pay reviews in preparation for the new requirements. Demand for pay analysis tools is “way up,” says White. What ChartHop's clients once considered to be an optional add-on is now treated as a requirement. The economic downturn has also shifted worker preferences about the type of pay they receive. “People just want more cash,” says Oluwole, whose job-hunting clients have focused their attentions on higher base salaries rather than stock options, which are more vulnerable to market downturns.</p> <p>Workers' motivation to make more money has a knock-on effect in terms of increasing pay transparency. Hannah Williams left her data analyst job in May to run the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@salarytransparentstreet\">Salary Transparent Street</a> video series full-time, in which she interviews people on the street about what they do and how much money they make. She launched the project in April, already has almost 1mn followers, and she says she has witnessed incredible momentum in the pay transparency movement over the past six months. “It's been enough to really change the landscape about whether talking about salaries is taboo. It's started a discussion, helping people recognise their worth and their value.”</p> <p>Salary Transparent Street evolved on TikTok after Williams posted a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@stocksandsquats/video/7060163618490486063?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lang=en\">video</a> in February about her own salary history. Her inspiration was simple: “I was underpaid!” When she entered the job market after college, she didn't know that negotiating with recruiters was an option. “No one ever told me that,” she says. And when she did ask for pay rises, she felt that employers “ran [her] around in circles”.</p> <p>When you know how much your coworkers and industry peers are making, “it makes it easier to advocate for yourself”, adds Oluwole. White says he has seen an increase in people sharing spreadsheets of salary data, often anonymised, in industries from tech to media and finance. There are also an increasing number of platforms including <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.teamblind.com/\">Blind</a>, <a href=\"https://www.levels.fyi/\">Levels.fyi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.repvue.com/\">RepVue</a> — and even corners of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/salarytransparency?lang=en\">TikTok</a> — where people are encouraged to disclose their salaries.</p> <p>Pay transparency has also <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/salary-range-transparency-reduces-gender-wage-gaps/\">been found to close wage gaps</a> that have long plagued women and people of colour under more opaque pay cultures, because peers are more easily able to compare and identify inequalities. But pay transparency might create other problems by pushing these pay gaps into differences between levels and promotions, Zhao notes. For example, if a company has 100 people with the same job title who are all earning different salaries, the company may simply restructure job titles — an associate manager versus a senior manager — in order to clarify differences in pay. This changes the question from whether someone is paid fairly to whether that person is promoted, or not, fairly.</p> <p>Another aspect of pay that companies must consider as they roll out transparency policies is location-based remuneration. As workforces spread out to different regions, some companies (like <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/google-renews-location-based-pay-debate.aspx\">Google</a>) have decided not to pay Silicon Valley or Wall Street rates to employees based in regions with a lower cost of living. Other companies (such as <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/location-independent-salaries/\">Buffer</a> and ChartHop) have taken the position that pay is given for the value of the work rather than a reflection of physical location, and so have committed to universal pay bands. White says that ChartHop's data of almost 1,000 companies suggests pay levels are converging between top-tier cities with high costs of living, and other, cheaper, cities around the US.</p> <p>One trend to watch for 2023 is the rise of retention budgets to keep staff by paying them more. Microsoft, for example, has doubled its budget for awarding merit-based rises, citing a desire to retain top talent.</p> <p>And as employees obtain more data about how much they should be paid, the power dynamic is shifting in favour of workers, despite the economic outlook. “A lot of power that companies had was based in secrecy,” says Oluwole. Now, that secrecy is crumbling. “It's time people earn what they need to have happy lives,” he says.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93514ad2-e087-463a-b624-5cabd48909d4\"><em>Be warned — transparency on pay causes more misery</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93514ad2-e087-463a-b624-5cabd48909d4\"><em>From Jonny King, Tokyo, Japan</em></a></p><p>Source: Sophia Smith 2022 'Pay transparency: how salary secrecy is being challenged' FT.com 18 December.
