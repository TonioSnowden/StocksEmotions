  "title": "The Future of Everything: The Festival Issue  ---  Should CEOs Take a Stand?  The head of Ben & Jerry's sees business as a force for social change -- and says the next generation of leaders will too.  ----  By Barbara Chai",
  "text": "<p>\n  What do ice cream and activism have in common? Ben &amp; Jerry's has long been committed to both. </p><p>\n  The company, founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield and acquired by Unilever in 2000, touts values such as human rights and economic justice as prominently as it introduces new flavors. Sometimes, it accomplishes both at the same time, such as when it rolled out its \"Colin Kaepernick's Change the Whirled\" nondairy dessert, with a portion of proceeds going to the athlete's Know Your Rights Camp organization to empower and support Black and brown communities. The company's communications regularly include calls to action for everything from fighting racism in the cannabis industry to scrutinizing U.S. prisons. </p><p>\n  In February, Chief Executive Matthew McCarthy wrote an op-ed in support of legislation that would study the possibility of paying reparations to descendants of enslaved people in the U.S., calling on \"other CEOs and business leaders to use our unique power and privilege to help our nation begin to heal.\" (A House panel approved the bill in April, but it still faces an uphill climb to becoming law.) </p><p>\n  \"One of the questions I get most often is, aren't you afraid of alienating consumers by the stands that you take at Ben &amp; Jerry's? It's the exact opposite,\" says Mr. McCarthy. </p><p>\n  Mr. McCarthy used to be an outlier, but in the past year, leaders at some of the world's biggest corporations have taken a stand on issues including immigration, voting rights and climate change, under pressure from employees, customers and shareholders. Last month, for example, more than 100 CEOs and senior business leaders joined a call to plan a response to new voting laws in dozens of states, with Kenneth Chenault, former CEO of American Express Co., and Kenneth Frazier, CEO of Merck &amp; Co., urging action on greater voting access. For many CEOs, this is uncharted territory that comes with a risk of alienating consumers, vendors, suppliers and employees, who may represent a wide spectrum of views. </p><p>\n  Increasingly, consumers will demand that companies protect the health and well-being of society and the environment, global market-research firm Euromonitor predicts in its annual trends report. According to the report, consumers will take social and environmental issues more seriously, and will seek out businesses that make the world cleaner, safer and more equitable. </p><p>\n  \"Everything is political to somebody or some group of people for some reason,\" says Mr. McCarthy, 52, who joined Ben &amp; Jerry's in 2018 as CEO after working mostly in the food business at Unilever since 1997. \"So you just got to get over this idea that business shouldn't get involved. That is just simply not reality.\" </p><p>\n  The Future of Everything caught up with Mr. McCarthy to discuss what lasting changes he sees for companies, consumers and chief executives. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: You've long believed that business can be a force for social change. What is different about the next generation of business? </p><p>\n  A: I've got about 30 years of business experience, so I don't kid myself. Whereas I feel fortunate that I've had the opportunities to come to the realization of things -- such as, that business can be a force for good, and that business needs to be part of making the world a better place, not just a less bad place -- more junior leaders who will replace me will already arrive with that belief in mind. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How do you envision the role of CEO changing in the future? </p><p>\n  A: I often see myself, right or wrong, in the business of radically redistributing power away from myself, and away from my leadership team, to the people who actually have most of the answers. That doesn't mean abdicating the positional power and the responsibility that I have as the CEO. It just means redefining it. If all decisions have to come to me, that slows the organization down. That makes us less competitive. What are the real mechanics of redistributing power away from a traditional, frankly, slow-moving and often out-of-touch group, and moving it toward the people? That process is not just a moving away. It's a constant flow, redistributing power and authority to the places that collectively help the organization do its best work, have its greatest impact. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What will future generations of consumers be looking for? </p><p>\n  A: A hell of a lot more co-creation. A hell of a lot more blurring of the lines between producer and consumer. We will see a complete change in how capitalism is actually structured to where the sources of value creation will actually sit with the consumer. It'll make us wonder, whose company actually is this? Businesses will pop out of the woodwork to actually solve specific issues. Commerce will be engaged with that, and then that business or brand may cease to exist when the problem that it was designed to solve no longer is a problem. We'll see much more of a blurring of the line of, where is the value being created? Particularly with more junior people, it will be centered on fixing the problems that we have left younger generations. </p><p>\n  -- Interview has been edited and condensed. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING FESTIVAL: Hear Mr. McCarthy and other leaders discuss the tactics and practices required to redefine, transform and sustain organizational culture, regardless of whether employees are working from the office or home.
