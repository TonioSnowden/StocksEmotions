Traditional organized crime groups such as the Italian Mafia and Camorra are dabbling in cybercrime. Europol, Spanish and Italian police said this week that they arrested more than 100 people who employed hackers and had ties to Mafia groups.

A prominent ransomware gang built a backdoor into software it provided to affiliates, in order to step in at critical points during the negotiation process, researchers found.

Some operators have been open about their ability to do this, while others keep it a secret, researchers said.
