  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Just Eat Takeaway.com's Grubhub has landed itself a tasty snack, but don't expect its U.S.-based competitors to starve. </p><p>\n  Shares of the Amsterdam-based delivery company jumped nearly 15% on July 6 after it said it struck a deal with Amazon.com to offer U.S. Prime subscribers one-year free of Grubhub's membership program, Grubhub+. As part of the deal, Amazon will receive warrants in Grubhub equivalent to 2% of Grubhub's equity and access to warrants for a further 13%. </p><p>\n  For JET, which has been looking to partner or sell the underperforming U.S. business for quite some time, investors' enthusiasm over its deal with a behemoth like Amazon seemed reasonable. Less so was their knee-jerk reaction to how it might adversely affect larger U.S. delivery players. Shares of DoorDash and Uber Technologies fell more than 7% and 4%, respectively, on the day the deal was announced. </p><p>\n  Grubhub could certainly score a big influx in subscriber numbers -- at least for a time. Just Eat Takeaway.com said in an October investor presentation that Grubhub+ had about 2.5 million subscribers, which offers unlimited free delivery on qualifying orders, among other \"exclusive perks.\" Amazon Prime, on the other hand, boasts about 170 million U.S. members, according to an estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, and Amazon said it just recorded its \"biggest Prime Day event\" ever this week based on items bought during the sale worldwide. </p><p>\n  But consider where those subscribers are located. YipitData estimates about three-quarters of Amazon Prime U.S. subscribers live outside of urban areas. That matters because Grubhub is known for its strength in U.S. cities, where it likely boasts better restaurant selection. YipitData's estimates show Grubhub has just 9% market share in U.S. suburbs, where DoorDash commands nearly 60% of the market and Uber Eats enjoys just under a third of the pie. So while the lack of overlap between Grubhub+'s current subscribers and those of Amazon Prime is promising, it doesn't necessarily mean it will bear much financial fruit for JET. </p><p>\n  Food-delivery customers polled by Citi cited selection, delivery times and lower fees as important criteria when choosing a delivery platform. Grubhub's competitors seem to have the upper hand on all three. Moreover, DoorDash and Uber have offered similar free annual memberships to their respective membership programs to some Chase and American Express customers, respectively. Amazon's partnership with Grubhub, meanwhile, might not last longer than a year if the retail giant either loses interest or feels like it has learned enough from the year's worth of data it sees. </p><p>\n  That could mean that Grubhub has just 12 months to show Amazon Prime members that its platform is worth paying for. </p><p>\n  Is it? Third-party estimates show that Grubhub has fewer merchants on its platform than competitors. Logistics matter, too. Compared with its key competitors, Grubhub was slow to focus on its own delivery performance. Food-delivery players don't regularly disclose the number of couriers they have, but they do disclose delivery times. Despite being most active in dense cities, Grubhub said Tuesday its average delivery time is \"around 35 minutes.\" That is about the same delivery time DoorDash cited in its public offering filing for the third quarter of 2020. </p><p>\n  Positively, for Prime Day, Amazon Prime's website cycled an advertisement for its Grubhub+ deal to its members with an activation link. Then again, Amazon's press release Thursday recapping Prime Day didn't mention Grubhub once. </p><p>\n  Grubhub's new partnership will probably bring more attention to its platform at a dark time for a company that over the past few years has seen its leadership position in the U.S. delivery market obliterated. In the end, though, it may just whet consumers' appetites for delivery platforms they already know and love. </p><p></p>",
