  "text": "<p>   American Express Co. is seeing consumer spending start to normalize as Covid-19 vaccinations pick up in the U.S. </p><p>   Spending in travel and entertainment categories rose 40% in March from February and bookings through American Express Travel jumped by 50% in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said Friday. Mr. Campbell said the number of people signing up for the company's co-branded cards with Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 90% in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter. </p><p>   Card companies took a hit over the past year as lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus led consumers to spend less on travel and entertainment. </p><p>   Mr. Campbell said there is an inflection point around the improving economy and increase in vaccinations. \"People are finally able to exercise the pent-up demand for travel that we believed in the whole time,\" he said. </p><p>   Billed business, or the amount spent on its cards, rose 6% in the first quarter from a year earlier adjusted for currency fluctuations. That measure fell by half for the travel and entertainment category in the quarter, compared with a year earlier, but it rose in March compared with declines in January and February. </p><p>   While travel and entertainment spending is showing signs of improving, Mr. Campbell said the company doesn't think cross-border travel will have fully returned to its 2019 level by 2022. \"In 2022, we're really assuming . . . that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it was pre-pandemic,\" Mr. Campbell said, adding that \"domestic travel in the U.S. and around the globe will be the fuel that gets us to that level.\" </p><p>   Even the U.S. economy and consumer behavior have started to normalize, the company saw e-commerce spending rise 23% year over year. </p><p>   \"As that physical retail has come back it has not cannibalized the growth we had seen in online and e-commerce,\" Mr. Campbell said in the interview. </p><p>   For the quarter, American Express had a provision expense benefit of $675 million. The company's provision a year earlier to cover potential credit losses was $2.62 billion. </p><p>   Profit for the first quarter was $2.24 billion, up from $367 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were $2.74, topping Wall Street's consensus of $1.61 a share, according to FactSet. A year ago, earnings were 41 cents a share. Revenue, net of interest expense, fell 12% to $9.06 billion, while Wall Street was expecting $9.21 billion. </p><p>   American Express shares fell 1.9% to $144.33 on Friday. </p><p></p>",
