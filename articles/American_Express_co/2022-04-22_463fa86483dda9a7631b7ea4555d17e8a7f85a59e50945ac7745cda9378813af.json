Take our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6819b43a-d1fc-43bf-a174-61e5fa7584c2\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Florida lawmakers yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b50f2f2e-591a-49bb-a4f3-ae2709c62440\">voted to revoke</a> Walt Disney's decades-old ability to govern the area around the Walt Disney World theme park in a move seen as retaliation from the Republican state governor Ron DeSantis over the media company's criticism of his administration's LGBTQ policies.</p> <p>One of the largest employers in Florida, Disney has enjoyed privileges in the state since 1967 that gave it autonomy over water, roads, emergency services and permitting on roughly 25,000 acres near the city of Orlando. It even had the ability to issue its own municipal bonds.</p> <p>The dispute between Florida's governor and one of the state's most prominent companies centres on a piece of legislation critics dubbed the “Don't Say Gay” law. </p> <p>The bill, which would ban schools in Florida from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity with children aged nine and younger, faced opposition from Disney's LGBTQ staff who called on chief executive Bob Chapek to oppose it.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8dae399f-9272-4ad2-b57d-5d2274e27532\">a public relations crisis</a> Chapek, who took over from Bob Iger at the beginning of the year, issued an apology to staff for not doing more to oppose the bill and suspended Disney's political donations to DeSantis and other backers of the bill.</p> <p>DeSantis, who is facing re-election this year and is believed to be considering a 2024 run for the White House, has since denounced Disney as a “woke” corporation.</p> <p>The bill will now go to DeSantis for a final signature before passing into law ending the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney special tax district is known, by June 2023.</p> <p><em>Thanks for all your comments about Netflix.

Are the demographics of work and business due for an overhaul?</p> <p><strong>Few galleries are selling NFTs despite the hype </strong>According to online sales platform Artsy's 2022 Gallery Insights report, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e1d22f-49b0-4d02-a0ab-6d2919a02c69\">only 11 per cent of galleries sold NFTs</a> in 2021, while 67 per cent said their clients had not even asked about them. Of those that did sell NFTs, half said their total sales value was $5,000 or less. </p> <p><strong>The fun way to predict the unpredictable</strong> Games can help us predict future crises that we never knew were possible, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76222711-2cbe-4148-abc4-c57fa031c9ee\">writes Tim Harford</a>, from global pandemics to wars and how they pan out. Games are fun, too, making their lessons that much easier to learn.</p> <p><strong>Global demographic trends create tough choices </strong>Richer countries that welcome and successfully integrate migrants will be able to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba313ea0-df4e-4f72-a47e-42cd43d26948\">smooth many of the financial pressures</a> of ageing. Others will try to offer financial incentives to increase birth rates, even though they have scant evidence of their effectiveness. Cultural change to make lives easier for parents, especially mothers, will also be needed, writes Chris Giles.
