  "text": "<p>S4 Capital has struck a deal for tech services company TheoremOne, its first acquisition since Sir Martin Sorrell's advertising start-up in late March revealed accounting issues related to its fast growth.</p> <p>The London-listed company on Tuesday said TheoremOne would merge with its subsidiary MediaMonks, a Netherlands-based digital production company that Sorrell has used to merge with dozens of other companies. </p> <p>Sorrell founded S4 in 2018, just after his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/617147b4-6cda-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa\">contentious departure</a> from the world's largest advertising group WPP, and has since strived to create a rival to the company he led for almost three decades. </p> <p>S4 would not reveal how much it had spent on Los Angeles-based TheoremOne, that was founded in 2007 and will be its 30th acquisition in just under four years. </p> <p>S4's shares were up just under 3 per cent on Tuesday, a level that was still lower by almost 40 per cent compared with the end of March, when its auditor PwC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6e9b957-8d40-461b-a1f1-4eb88a034bdd\">failed to sign off</a> on its accounts at the last minute. </p> <p>Many of S4's previous deals have been made by offering a 50:50 split in cash and S4 shares, an approach that would have become harder given the recent plunge in the stock. </p> <p>Analysts at Citi suggested S4 would be less likely to have used its shares as part of the TheoremOne deal as it had “indicated that it was uncomfortable issuing equity at the current level”.</p> <p>S4 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/725eb3a9-a13d-496f-9354-504e7b30b464\">released its annual results</a> earlier this month and said that understanding of international accounting standards had been “lacking” at MediaMonks, with issues mainly related to revenue and cost of sales recognition.</p> <p>Sorrell earlier this month called the delay “unacceptable and embarrassing” and S4's head of finance Mary Basterfield, who joined in January, promised to “upskill” her new team. </p> <p>The accounting issue led the company to adjust its annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by roughly 5 per cent.</p> <p>The chief executive of TheoremOne, Brady Brim-DeForest, said the “entrepreneurial, growth-focused culture at S4 Capital” was one where he was confident the company's team would feel “right at home”.</p> <p>TheoremOne clients include American Express, AT&amp;T and Starbucks and the company made $58mn in sales last year. S4's acquisition of the company will add one so-called “whopper” account, meaning a client that generates more than $20mn in revenue a year.</p> <p>The deal is expected to add $8mn, or roughly 5 per cent, to S4's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2022.</p> <p>.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson in London 2022 'Martin Sorrell's S4 resumes acquisitions with TheoremOne deal' FT.com 17 May.
