  "title": "Hertz Emerges From Bankruptcy  ----  By Alexander Gladstone and Becky Yerak",
  "text": "<p>   Hertz Global Holdings Inc. emerged from bankruptcy protection on Wednesday under new owners and a new board. </p><p>   The directors of the reorganized Hertz will include at least two representatives each from Certares Management LLC and Knighthead Capital Management LLC, which prevailed in May in a bidding war for the rental-car company. Apollo Global Management Inc., which joined the winning bid, is getting one board seat. </p><p>   The board will also include as many as four independent directors. One of them is Mark Fields, a former CEO of Ford Motor Co. Up to three independent directors will be named later, according to court papers. </p><p>   New board chairman Gregory O'Hara, founder and senior managing director of Certares, said Mr. Fields and the other independent directors won't be affiliated with any of the major investment funds that are recapitalizing the company. </p><p>   Hertz aims to recruit new board members who represent diverse views, including women, minorities and people living outside the U.S., Mr. O'Hara said. </p><p>   Under the bankruptcy deal, Knighthead, Certares and its co-investors are buying the bulk of Hertz's equity for roughly $2.8 billion. Shareholders and bondholders backed a roughly $1.6 billion equity rights offering, while Apollo is purchasing $1.5 billion in preferred equity. </p><p>   The competition for control of Hertz drove up its value so sharply that it was able to cover its debt in full and supply a handsome payout to shareholders, who are normally wiped out when companies go bankrupt. </p><p>   After the bankruptcy exit, Hertz shares will continue to trade over the counter, though the controlling investors are considering relisting on a stock exchange eventually, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The newly reorganized company will take steps to revamp its operations, including optimizing demand forecasting and inventory management systems, and changing its fleet composition to adopt electric and alternate fuel vehicles, Mr. O'Hara said. </p><p>   Hertz will also aim to implement new customer-service models where people can check in without having to stand in line to get their rental car. </p><p>   \"I cannot think of any good reason for customers to ever stand in line given all the tech available, except in unusual circumstances,\" Mr. O'Hara said. </p><p>   The company, which was the only big U.S. rental-car provider to file for chapter 11 during the coronavirus pandemic, aims to use newly raised financing to close a performance gap with Avis Budget Group Inc. and Enterprise Holdings Inc., people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   \"We could see how a successful vaccine rollout would precede a tightening supply of rental cars against rising demand,\" said Rebwar Berzinji, a financial adviser to a shareholder group that teamed up with Knighthead and Certares to put together the winning bid. </p><p>   In addition to his new chairman post at Hertz, Mr. O'Hara is executive chairman of travel-management company American Express Global Business Travel and vice chairman of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, the parent of online travel platform Tripadvisor. </p><p>   Certares senior managing director Colin Farmer will also join the Hertz board, according to court records. His board memberships include Internova Travel Group. </p><p>   Certares and Knighthead formed an investment vehicle last year to back travel and leisure businesses disrupted by the pandemic and have invested in airlines Latam Airlines Group SA, based in Chile, and Azul SA, based in Brazil. </p><p>   Knighthead will appoint partner Andrew Shannahan and co-founder Thomas Wagner to the board. Apollo's seat is being filled by Christopher Lahoud, a partner in Apollo's credit department. </p><p>   Holdovers from the current board will include Hertz Chief Executive Paul Stone and Vincent Intrieri, a longtime Hertz director who is CEO and founder of VDA Capital Management LLC. </p><p></p>",
