  "title": "The real Chelsea Flower Show is about so much more than flowers",
  "text": "<p>It was a simple plan: impress a potential client by taking him to an exclusive £785-a-head dinner in London. Twirling my American Express Centurion, I call to make the reservation. The conversation goes something like this:</p> <p>“I'd like to book a table for two on Monday September 20, please.”</p> <p>“I'm sorry, madam, but your name does not appear to have been selected as one of those invited to apply for the Gala drinks and dinner tickets.”</p> <p>“I'm not applying, thank you. I'm ready to pay your reassuringly outrageous price for dinner in a tent. By the way, I'm going to claim my £25 discount for being a Royal Horticultural Society member, and I'd also like to avail myself of the opportunity to use your ‘free' parking, even if it is half a mile away.”</p> <p>“Madam might be interested to know that such was the enthusiasm for the Gala drinks and dinner, we conducted a ballot to select those whose custom would be welcome.”</p> <p>Then he mumbled something that sounded distinctly like, “It's an excellent system for keeping hoi polloi and journalists at bay.”</p> <p>That was the gist of the conversation, even if not entirely accurately reported. The point is that the same event launches the Chelsea Flower Show every year, it is taking place this Monday and it remains, frankly, swanky.</p> <p>While the gala leaves many gardeners and allotment holders unimpressed, it still appeals to a discrete elite who continue to be drawn to the bash undaunted by the pandemic. (It is held mostly outside, after all.) Sponsors and deal makers pay by the barrow load to be there in order to rub shoulders with movers and shakers, green fingered or otherwise. For some, the flowers are incidental.</p> <p>Calling Chelsea a “flower show” is roughly equivalent to calling the Champions League a “kick around”. Like the latter, Chelsea involves serious money albeit a tiny sliver of the UK gardening market's value of about £24bn.</p> <p>At around 3 o'clock on the Monday afternoon — I think of it as Royal Monday — nursery men and women, designers, gardeners, flower arrangers, digger drivers and journalists are shooed off the 11-acre site at the Royal Hospital Chelsea by security guards, and the noise and hubbub subsides to an exhausted and expectant hush as the Queen arrives.</p> <p>A couple of hours later Hollywood, royals, rock stars, the City of London and a smattering of the cabinet arrive for a champagne-fuelled party around the gardens. Chelsea is a sort of pop-up club for the rich and powerful until the last pair of Louboutins teeter out of the marquees at the end of Royal Monday, fuelled by some of the 10,000 glasses of Fortnum &amp; Mason champagne downed during the week.</p> <p>For the rest of the week, garden lovers take their place. So, too, do TV crews and presenters (the BBC builds a media village at the back of the show); social media; magazines and newspapers, all of which help give the impression that Chelsea is purely about pretty plants, sexy gardens and fabulous flowers.</p> <p>In the early 2000s the RHS, which started the show in 1913, produced figures suggesting that more chief executives appear at Chelsea than any other event in the English “season” (for the uninitiated, that means Henley Royal Regatta, Goodwood races, Ascot etc, where crumbling high society mingle with the newly enriched). Today the RHS is more reticent about figures but, either way, do CEOs really like flowers that much? Some do, but the reason that Chelsea is popular with so many is to do with its proximity to the City and its client-pleasing tendency.</p> <p>The show is also important to the charity sector, and most particularly to the RHS, itself a charity. “Chelsea is our largest fundraiser,” says Helena Pettit, director of shows and gardens for the RHS. “And we really get to showcase what the RHS can do, including our sustainability and environmental work. Our research shows an upsurge in interest in gardening since the pandemic.”</p> <p>Indeed, the Horticultural Trades Association reports that there are 3m more gardeners as a result of the pandemic. But, despite the growth in interest, the pandemic hit the RHS hard because Chelsea had to be cancelled in 2020 and moved from May to September this year, all of which has cost it about £50m. Money that would normally be used to support 36,000 school garden projects; new RHS gardens such as RHS Bridgewater; the gardening competition Britain in Bloom; RHS libraries; scientific research and many other worthy schemes.</p> <p>So you get the idea: Chelsea is even more important than its gala party and its plants.</p> <p>This is the last year that M&amp;G Investments will be the headline sponsor, after 11 years at the helm. And with eight months to go until next year's show, the RHS has yet to find a replacement, surprising given the show's kudos, less so given the economy-suppressing effect of the pandemic. Anyone wanting to follow in M&amp;G's green footprints needs to find about £2.5m, which buys presence on Royal Monday, the chance to entertain clients at breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks all week, a prominent sponsor's garden on the largest plot and a mention every time the show appears on TV.</p> <p>A company in need of buffing up its profile and annual report might also like to consider the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/esg-investing\">environmental, social and corporate governance</a> benefits. As Pettit points out, “It's a lot more than putting a company name on the show. The RHS is in discussion with several potential sponsors who are looking to work as a partnership with the RHS, with the same ethos in terms of our charitable aims.”</p> <p>M&amp;G's swansong garden is by Charlotte Harris and Hugo Bugg, who made the courageous decision to stick to their original planting plan, which was designed for May. They are using most of the same plants including handsome black parsley (Melanoselinum decipiens), which will be strutting seed heads instead of great pads of white flowers, rose glauca (orange hips rather than pink flowers) and sea buckthorn with its vivid orange berries.</p> <p>“We are exploring new ways of doing things, from pocket parks to shared gardens in our increasingly urbanised society,” says Harris. “Connecting with green space should now be seen [as being] as important as connecting to power and water.”</p> <p>One of this year's new sponsors is Boodles, the eccentric English jeweller, which has commissioned Chelsea veteran Tom Hoblyn to design its Secret Garden, celebrating Frances Hodgson Burnett's children's story. Hoblyn, who was approached a few months ago, designed the garden from scratch for September with tree ferns, purple/mauve Verbena hastata (rather a relief after decades of Verbena bonariensis dominating Chelsea), grasses, 2m-3m pale pink Dahlia campanulata, and pale pink Fuchsia magellanica var. Molinae.</p> <p>“I've been dreading the plants misbehaving because we've had such a weird summer,” says Hoblyn. “And all the red tape around Covid has been slowing the build but it all helps to keep us safe, I suppose. But I have my dream team for planting: my son Harry, who is a gardener, and daughter Elisabeth, who is an interior designer.”</p> <p>Boodles' director James Amos sees Chelsea as being in keeping with the company's presence at 170-200 events a year, from its Salon Privé at Blenheim Palace to the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials.</p> <p>Isn't it a bold move to take on big sponsorship at such an uncertain time?</p> <p>“We were down 30 per cent on the financial year ending February 2020, but since reopening in April business has been better than ever,” says Amos, who has budgeted about £100,000 for the garden and a further £50,000 for marketing around Chelsea.</p> <p>“We are a people-facing business and so we have a trade stand as well as the garden at Chelsea,” he says. Boodles is pumping Chelsea for all it's worth, using many of the show's corporate entering spots from breakfast to dinner.</p> <p>“There has been such good uptake that we may be over our limit,” Amos tells me from his vegetable garden in East Anglia. He is a committed gardener. “We are not particularly well known and we are not international. We hope to build brand reputation with Chelsea's national and international audience.”</p> <p>This year's international Chelsea visitors and entrants have been hit by travel restrictions, but there is a still a decent cross section of exhibitors from China and Thailand to Finland and Ireland.</p> <p>Those with a little spare change jingling in their pockets might like to consider Boodles' latest offering. “We have created a piece for the garden, a £300,000 pink diamond bracelet called New Beginning and made from pink diamonds from a mine which is now closed,” says Amos. </p> <p>As a nod to the snowdrops incorporated in the bracelet design, Hoblyn has included autumn snowdrops in the Boodles/Chelsea garden.</p> <p>With all this money flying about from smaller sponsors such as Boodles, never mind big guns such as M&amp;G, what metrics do marketing departments use to measure Chelsea's success or otherwise?</p> <p>M&amp;G found it a good match for its customer base and for showcasing some of its community work around housing. This year it is giving away many of the corporate hospitality tickets as a boost to the charities with which it works.</p> <p>Boodles says it will be able to gauge Chelsea's effectiveness because its sales people tend to have close and long relationships with customers.</p> <p>“If we just sit in a shop and hope that people arrive, they won't,” says Amos.</p> <p>This is an issue faced by RHS shops and all its other efforts to fundraise in these beleaguered times, as the RHS director-general Sue Biggs outlines.</p> <p>“Although we are delighted to have reached £34m of our £40m fundraising target, we still need more support from donors and funders to raise £6m. We can then expand the educational and community outreach facilities.”</p> <p>The shortfall is small beer by City standards, perhaps, but critically important to gardens which are, after all, one of the UK's great soft-power exports. British garden designers are in demand from China to the US to Europe.</p> <p>That power will wither without the resources to train the next generation, as the RHS's new president Keith Weed observed after this year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7e78e22-8eee-11ea-9e12-0d4655dbd44f\">virtual Chelsea Flower Show in May</a>: “The interest generated among a younger audience was especially welcome and something we will continue to build on.”</p> <p>He's right, but I hope that the perennial obsession with bringing young people into the trade doesn't overshadow the importance of ancient people, like me, in the garden world. It's not just the champagne.
