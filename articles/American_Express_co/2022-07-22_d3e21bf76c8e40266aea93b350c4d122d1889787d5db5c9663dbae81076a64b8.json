  "text": "<p>With a 2.5% rise for the week, the S&amp;P 500 capped its best week in a month. Nonetheless, few investors are willing to call a bottom to a selloff that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 17% this year. Persistently high inflation, the possibility of a recession and the war in Ukraine remain at the forefront of investors' minds. Next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve, as well as coming gross domestic product data, could inject more volatility in the markets.</p><p>\"We had been enjoying improved sentiment lately,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \"Earnings reports earlier this week weren't terrific, but they also weren't terrible.\" Come Friday, the \"rose-colored glasses\" came off, she said.</p><p>Late Thursday, Snap, the parent company of popular photo-sharing social-media app Snapchat, posted its weakest quarterly sales growth as a public company and held off issuing new guidance. The stock tumbled $6.39, or 39%, to $9.96, weighing on other communication-services and technology stocks, the two sectors that were the biggest drags on the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Megacap technology companies Meta Platforms andAlphabet pulled back, falling $13.90, or 7.6%, to $169.27 and $6.44, or 5.6%, to $107.90, respectively. Meanwhile,American Express shares rose $2.83, or 1.9%, to $153.01 after the company reported a31% rise in revenue.</p><p>Among other individual stocks, Twitter shares erased earlier declines and rose 32 cents, or 0.8%, to $39.84 after the company posted a loss and noted that revenue was hurt by uncertainty related to Elon Musk's acquisition.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 companies are beating second-quarter earnings estimates by 3.6%, according toFactSet, which is below the five-year average of 8.8%. With about a fifth of the companies in the index having reported, 10 companies have issued earnings guidance for the third quarter that is below consensus estimates, while one has offered a forecast that is ahead of Wall Street's projections.</p><p>\"Guidance in these earnings reports is all-important to Wall Street,\" said Michael Farr, CEO of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington LLC. \"Companies that have missed earnings estimates have been punished, but they haven't been as punished as those who say they're going to miss in the future.\"</p><p>Verizon Communications shares fell $3.21, or 6.7%, to $44.45 Friday after the company said it expects cash-strapped customers and stiffer competition to pressure its business in coming months.</p><p>Even with Friday's declines, the S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq ended the week with solid gains, offering a respite to investors who have seen their portfolios pummeled this year. A stretch of earnings reports this week have given investors confidence to wade in and scoop up beaten-down stocks. Netflix and Tesla were among the companies that exceeded Wall Street expectations, sending their shares soaring to become two of the S&amp;P 500's best performers this week.</p><p>Some investors say they have jumped back into the market in recent weeks to take advantage of bargains, noting that extreme bearish sentiment is often a contrarian signal. BofA Global Research this week reported \"max bearish\" sentiment among investors in its Bull &amp; Bear Indicator.</p><p>\"There's lots of metrics that point to negativity on equities. That's a good starting point for us and what has given us more confidence\" to add to equity positions, said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal &amp; General Investment Management.</p><p>Meantime, investors are maintaining a close eye on Europe, which has been beset by concerns about the cost of living and an energy crisis that could push economies into recession. On Friday, fresh business surveys suggested that the eurozone economycontracted in July. Excluding pandemic lockdown months, this would mark the first contraction signaled by purchasing managers' indexes since 2013.</p><p>Still, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.3%. Traders remain focused on the flow of Russian natural gas through the critical Nord Stream pipeline, as well as the ripple effects from the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The index ended the week up 2.9%.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.781%, down from 2.908% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Drop, Ending Three-Day Rally</p>",
