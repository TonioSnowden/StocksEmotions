  "text": "<p>With a 3.5% rise for the week through Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 was on pace to cap its best week in a month. Nonetheless, few investors are willing to call a bottom to a selloff that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 16% this year. Persistently high inflation, the possibility of a recession and the war in Ukraine remain at the forefront of investors' minds. Next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve, as well as coming gross domestic product data, could inject more volatility in the markets.</p><p>Communication-services and technology stocks were the biggest drags on the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.</p><p>Snap shares tumbled 39%, weighing on the sector and adding fuel to investor fears about the state of business growth, after it posted itsweakest quarterly sales growth as a public company. The parent company of popular photo-sharing social-media app Snapchat said it would substantially reduce its rate of hiring.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter shares pared earlier declines and rose 1.1% after the company posted a loss and noted that revenue was hurt by uncertainty related to Elon Musk's acquisition.</p><p>Other megacap technology companies, including Meta Platforms and Alphabet, pulled back, falling 7.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, American Express shares rose 2.1% after the company reported a 31% rise in revenue.</p><p>Even with Friday's wobbles, the S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are all on pace to end the week with solid gains, offering a respite to investors who have seen their portfolios pummeled this year. A stretch of earnings reports this week have given investors confidence to wade in and scoop up beaten-down stocks. Netflix and Tesla were among the companies that exceeded Wall Street expectations, sending their shares soaring to become two of the S&amp;P 500's best performers this week.</p><p>Some investors say they have jumped back into the market in recent weeks to take advantage of bargains, noting that extreme bearish sentiment is often a contrarian signal. BofA Global Research this week reported \"max bearish\" sentiment among investors in its Bull &amp; Bear Indicator.</p><p>\"There's lots of metrics that point to negativity on equities. That's a good starting point for us and what has given us more confidence\" to add to equity positions, said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal &amp; General Investment Management.</p><p>Earnings reports haven't been extra encouraging. S&amp;P 500 companies are beating second-quarter earnings estimates by 3.6%, according to FactSet, which is below the five-year average of 8.8%. The blended quarterly earnings growth rate from the prior year is 4.8%. If that holds, it will mark the lowest year-over-year growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020, FactSet data show.</p><p>Meantime, investors are maintaining a close eye on Europe, which has been beset by concerns about the cost of living and an energy crisis that could push economies into recession. On Friday, fresh business surveys suggested that the eurozone economycontracted in July. Excluding pandemic lockdown months, this would mark the first contraction signaled by purchasing managers' indexes since 2013.</p><p>Still, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.3%. Traders remain focused on the flow of Russian natural gas through the critical Nord Stream pipeline, as well as the ripple effects from the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.</p><p>The euro retreated 0.4% against the dollar to $1.0192, raising the possibility that Europe's common currencycould reach parity again.</p><p>Brent crude fell 0.6% to $103.20 a barrel Friday.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.788%, down from 2.908% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall After Three-Day Rally</p>",
