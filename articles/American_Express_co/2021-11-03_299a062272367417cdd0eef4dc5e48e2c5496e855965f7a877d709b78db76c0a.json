  "title": "A Musk Tweet Muddies  Tesla's Big Hertz Deal  ----  By Omar Abdel-Baqui, Alexander Gladstone and Nora Naughton",
  "text": "<p>    It was a deal that Wall Street celebrated as a new model for the rental-car industry. Then with one bombshell tweet, Elon Musk cast Hertz Global Holdings Inc.'s deal to buy 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc. in doubt. </p><p>   \"I'd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet,\" Mr. Musk, chief executive at Tesla, said in a tweet late Monday. </p><p>   By Tuesday morning Hertz had responded, apparently standing by its prior pronouncements. </p><p>   A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz's website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. </p><p>   \"As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging infrastructure across the company's global operations,\" the Hertz spokeswoman said. \"We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet.\" </p><p>   But confusion remained Tuesday. Hertz declined to comment beyond its statement. The company wouldn't say whether there was a signed contract between the two companies or, if not, why not. \"We don't discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner,\" a Hertz spokeswoman said. </p><p>   Tesla and Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   When the bulk order was announced, optimism abounded: It would get more Teslas out on the road. Hertz would offer their customers a new fleet of electric vehicles. Football star Tom Brady was tapped to promote the pact for Hertz. Both stocks surged; Tesla became a $1 trillion company and Mr. Musk's wealth surpassed $300 billion. </p><p>   Tesla shares fell 3% on Tuesday. Hertz shares, which trade over the counter, rose 2.7%. </p><p>   Mr. Musk's latest tweet comes as his actions on social media have been scrutinized in recent years. A 2018 Securities and Exchange Commission investigation alleged that Mr. Musk misled investors by tweeting about a potential buyout of Tesla when he posted \"funding secured\" on Twitter. Mr. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million to settle that case. Mr. Musk agreed to have his statements overseen by Tesla lawyers. </p><p>   Financial terms of the deal between Hertz and Tesla weren't provided during last week's announcement. Based on list prices of the Model 3, the cost to Hertz would top $4 billion. </p><p>   Mr. Musk's tweet was in response to a chart showing the upward trend of Tesla's stock. Another part of his tweet addressed whether Hertz was getting any discount, which Mr. Musk said last week and again Monday it wasn't -- his point being that Tesla isn't hurting for orders. </p><p>   \"Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics,\" Mr. Musk said in the tweet. </p><p>   The seemingly conflicting messages between Mr. Musk and Hertz cast into the spotlight the relationships between auto makers and rental-car companies. Deals between the two tend to be fairly malleable and details such as volume and price can continue to be negotiated after a contract is struck, analysts say. For instance, many orders have been canceled or reduced this year as the auto industry grapples with a global shortage of semiconductors. </p><p>   For Hertz, the deal was one of its most prominent since it exited from bankruptcy in June. Shortly after emerging from chapter 11, representatives of the company's new owners approached Tesla with the goal of placing a big bulk order for its rental-car fleet, people familiar with the matter said last week. The Hertz team spent months negotiating with Tesla as they worked toward reaching a deal, the people said. </p><p>   Hertz confronted the challenge of refilling its fleet as demand for its services rebounded and the continuing semiconductor shortage hampered the automotive manufacturing industry. The company also aimed to fulfill a growing demand for electric vehicles, from both corporate clients looking for green options, as well as everyday rental customers and ride-hailing drivers, they said. </p><p>   Hertz's largest new shareholder, travel-focused private-equity firm Certares Management LLC, had conducted research that found corporate clients were willing to pay a substantial premium to have their employees drive electric vehicles, because many of them have stated intent to get to carbon neutral. Certares, which also owns American Express Global Business Travel and Tripadvisor Inc., could also see from its various platforms that customers had begun to pivot away from gas-guzzling SUVs and were increasingly requesting electric vehicles, one of the people said. </p><p>   Rather than buying the cars using cash from Hertz's own balance sheet, the purchases would be conducted through Hertz's special-purpose subsidiaries, which issue bonds to finance the purchase of new cars, with the vehicles serving as collateral for the bond investors, they said. </p><p>   When Hertz emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy it eliminated nearly $5 billion in debt through its financial restructuring and secured a $2.8 billion exit credit facility. The company's total liquidity as of Sept. 30 was about $3.85 billion, consisting of a mixture of cash and availability on its credit lines, according to company filings. </p><p>   Tesla shares soared after the Hertz announcement, topping $1 trillion in market value. Mr. Musk's personal net worth also exceeded $300 billion in the days following the announcement and was recently $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p><p>   Hertz shares have risen more than 40% since the Tesla deal was announced on Oct. 25. The stock has been traded over the counter since the company was delisted in the summer of 2020. </p><p>   Sales to rental-car fleets are often viewed as a liability for auto makers. While the business can help expose people to brands they may not have previously considered buying, overreliance on selling cars to rental-car fleets over time can hurt a brand's image and dent resale values, analysts and auto executives say. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alexander Saeedy contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
