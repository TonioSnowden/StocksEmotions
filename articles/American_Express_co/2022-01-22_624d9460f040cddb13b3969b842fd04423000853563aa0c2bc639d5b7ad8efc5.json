  "title": "Hollywood indie film distributor admits stealing $30 million from BlackRock to buy a $14 million Beverly Hills mansion (and a Tesla)",
  "text": "<p>A Hollywood indie film distributor has pleaded guilty to stealing more than $30 million from a fund run by investment giant BlackRock and using the money to buy a $14 million mansion in Beverly Hills.</p><p>William Sadleir, 67, co-founded Aviron Pictures in 2017, distributing thrillers like “Kidnap” starring Halle Berry, and “Serenity” featuring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathway.&#xa0;</p><p>Federal prosecutors say Sadleir got the company started with a $75 million investment from BlackRock's Multi-Sector Income Trust fund. But instead of using that money for movies, prosecutors say he put more than $30 million into his own pockets.</p><p>According to court documents, Sadleir spent $14 million of the money to buy a lavish mansion in Beverly Hills, $3 million to remodel Aviron's Hollywood offices, $250,000 to settle a legal dispute and $127,000 on a Tesla TSLA. He also paid himself and his wife $350,000.</p><p>To misappropriate the money, prosecutors say Sadleir created a sham company and even posed as a fictitious advertising executive in order to convince BlackRock that Aviron had used large portions of the cash to finance non-existent marketing deals. Sadleir also was accused of forging documents to lift BlackRock's liens from certain intellectual property in order to take additional loans against them without the fund's consent.</p><p>When approached by investigators in 2020, Sadleir allegedly admitted he had “f***ed up,” according to a civil complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>In an email, Sadleir's attorney said his client took full responsibility for his actions.</p><p>“While the decision to plead guilty is always difficult, it was important for Mr. Sadleir to take responsibility for his behavior.&#xa0; Mr. Sadleir apologizes to everyone who has been hurt by his actions,” attorney Matthew Schwartz wrote.</p><p>After discovering the money had disappeared, BlackRock filed a civil suit against Aviron and announced that it wrote off its entire $75 million investment. Blackrock later said it fired the&#xa0; manager of the fund for violating its conflict of interest rules because his actress daughter had appeared in a film Aviron had worked on.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Fraud, the sequel</p><p>Sadleir is separately facing charges in California of fraudulently filing in 2020 for $1.7 million in payroll protection program loans for Aviron even though he had already been removed from the company. He allegedly used the money to make a $40,000 car payment and cover his American Express bills.</p><p>His attorney in that case declined to comment.</p><p>Prosecutors say Sadleir had initially covered up the theft by telling BlackRock by he had spent $25 million on pre-paid media credits with MediaCom Worldwide, a division of global advertising giant GroupM Worldwide. He then created a fake company, GroupM Media Services, LLC, to make it appear the money had gone where he said it had.&#xa0; He also posed as an imaginary GroupM executive, “Amanda Stevens” to convince BlackRock that the media deals were in place.&#xa0;</p><p>Sadleir faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced in May.&#xa0;</p><p>“We called a wrap on Sadleir's scheming, and he now faces significant time in federal prison,” said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York.</p>",
