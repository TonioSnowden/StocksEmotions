  "text": "<p>   How much Mr. Palihapitya earned or invested personally is more difficult to discern from the filings. He highlights that he invests hundreds of millions of dollars in private placements accompanying his SPAC deals, a decision that helped sway Opendoor and SoFi to take his offers, according to people familiar with the matter. But it is sometimes unclear how much of that money is coming directly from him or from investment firms he helps manage. The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new guidance in December for SPAC sponsors to provide more disclosure around their compensation arrangements. </p><p>   People who know and have worked with Mr. Palihapitiya describe him as a great salesman but a poor manager. When Social Capital decided to transition away from a traditional venture-capital firm in 2018 to be more of a holding company for startups, many employees learned they would be losing their jobs from a Medium post Mr. Palihapitiya published, a person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya's skills as a hype man, though, are particularly well-suited to the features of SPACs. Unlike in a traditional IPO, executives and sponsors of SPAC transactions can make projections about the company's future revenue and profits. Because such deals are structured as mergers, SPAC sponsors don't have to worry about restrictions on talking openly about a business before its shares start trading. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya takes advantage of these loopholes. He talks his deals up on Twitter, which his lawyers then submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission to comply with stock-solicitation rules. Mr. Palihapitiya arranged with CNBC extended airtime on the days his deals were announced and went through slides from his investor presentation, according to people familiar with the matter. CNBC declined to comment. YouTube and Amazon.com Inc.'s Twitch have also approached him about moving his deal announcements to their live-video streaming services, some of the people said. </p><p>   As many as 70% of the investors in Mr. Palihapitiya's SPACs are everyday investors, these people said. He allocates a small percentage of the shares in the offerings of his SPACs for that crowd, with an eye toward getting his underwriters to increase their share above 50%, the people said. </p><p>   Alex Cruzado watched Mr. Palihapitiya's CNBC clips after seeing his April 2020 rant. The 20-year-old university student living in Geneva, Switzerland, bought shares in IPOE on the day of the SoFi announcement and later posted positive reviews of it on WallStreetBets. </p><p>   \"For companies like Opendoor and SoFi, the fact that he talks about it and makes a public announcement directs people in,\" Mr. Cruzado said in an interview. \"He's really great at marketing . . . [but] there's no significant value he adds but that branding and packaging,\" Mr. Cruzado said. </p><p>   During his Jan. 7 appearance on the business network to elaborate on SoFi's merits, Mr. Palihapitiya offered his thoughts on how SPACs are helping to reduce wealth inequality by letting ordinary Americans get earlier access to future blue-chip companies. </p><p>   \"How do you do that? You're not going to do that by owning American Express. Those companies are dormant legacy businesses. That game is over. You need companies like SoFi. You need companies like Opendoor, like Clover and others,\" he said. </p><p>   The moderators of WallStreetBets later banned its millions of members from posting about SPACs. \"They are too easily pumped to allow on a subreddit of our size,\" one wrote at the time. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya jumped into the fray in late January when traders, inspired by posts on WallStreetBets, bid up GameStop Corp. and other beaten-down stocks, dealing painful losses to hedge funds that had bet the stocks would fall. </p><p>   \"This is some insane, crazy, baller shit: r/wsb just ran over one of the most successful hedge funds around,\" Mr. Palihapitiya tweeted, linking to a Wall Street Journal article about hedge fund Melvin Capital Management's emergency cash infusion. </p><p>   In solidarity, he bought GameStop call options. He closed his position the next day and donated the proceeds. </p><p>   When Robinhood Markets Inc. and other online brokerages restricted trading in hot stocks, enraging investors, Mr. Palihapitiya went on the attack. Robinhood executives were \"corporatist scumbags\" who \"should go to jail,\" he said on his podcast, \"All-In.\" </p><p>   On Jan. 28 and 29, he told his Twitter followers that he turned Robinhood down when the startup was raising money years ago -- and that Robinhood was misleadingly monetizing user data. He suggested they ditch the app and use SoFi, instead. A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment. </p><p>   Over each of the two days, shares of the SPAC merging with SoFi notched double-digit gains. Retail interest was so strong that Robinhood placed limits on users' ability to purchase them lest the brokerage have to deposit additional collateral with its clearinghouse to cover the trades. Of the 51 stocks in which Robinhood restricted trading on Jan. 29, Mr. Palihapitiya was tied to four. </p><p>   In early February, investors in Mr. Palihapitiya's SPACs were reminded that there is risk in taking unproven companies public quickly. Short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report on Feb. 4 accusing Clover Health of failing to tell investors about a Department of Justice investigation into its practices and misleadingly marketing its services to the elderly. Hindenburg previously exposed irregularities at electric-truck startup Nikola Corp. after it merged with a SPAC. </p><p>   \"Chamath has done a masterful job marketing himself, capitalizing on the recent chaos with GameStop and WallStreetBets to align himself with 'everyday' investors -- but his public persona strikes us as the sugar that helps the poison go down,\" Hindenburg wrote in the report. </p><p>   Clover said the report was full of inaccuracies and mischaracterizations. In a response published last month on Medium, Clover's CEO and president said Hindenburg framed its report around Mr. Palihapitiya \"in order to sensationalize what is otherwise a rather underwhelming piece of research.\" Mr. Palihapitiya took to -- where else -- Twitter to defend Clover, saying he and the company would have been happy to have met with Hindenburg: \"Instead, they chose to take the cheap path of screaming into the ether.\" </p><p>   The tweet got more than 3,000 retweets and more than 17,000 likes, but, since then, Clover shares are down 44%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Amrith Ramkumar contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
