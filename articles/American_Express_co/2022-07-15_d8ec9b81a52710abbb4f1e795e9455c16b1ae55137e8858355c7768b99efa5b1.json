  "text": "<p>The Standards team's guidance on partial anonymity applies to reporting on any topic anywhere: We avoid identifying sources in this way unless they meet two tests in extreme cases—a legitimate reason to fear serious, physical harm and a significant role in the article, video or podcast.</p><p>Does a one-name identifier help our audience follow the story we are telling? For a piece that mentions and quotes a person several times, the answer is often yes; it might read better with a name rather than a descriptor such as the Afghan spy. In references to other anonymous sources—those who play a lesser role, are mentioned only in passing, or aren't quoted—the answer is usually no. Use a descriptor and no name, even when a person is willing to be called by only one name.</p><p>When granting partial anonymity in these rare cases, we should be clear with our audience. Include a sentence such as The Wall Street Journal agreed to use only her first name. Otherwise, a reader might think that we are using pseudonyms, which we don't. We generally don't need to say further why we are publishing only one name. The reason is almost always to protect in some way the person who is speaking to us, or that person's family, and doesn't need to be stated explicitly. If the context described in the article doesn't make the reason obvious, an exception can be considered. Consult with senior editors or the Standards team—which, it should be noted, retains the right to ask for sourcing details in every case.</p><p>Roe v. Wade</p><p>The recent Supreme Court decision means we need to take added care to ensure we are being accurate and precise when referring to the \"right to an abortion.\" Here is an explanation, via The Wall Street Journal's Standards editors, that has been added to the stylebook. The second paragraph here was adapted from the existing entry in the stylebook, which will remain:</p><p>abortion</p><p>After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2022, there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, so be precise in using terms to describe the current legal framework that varies by state in the U.S. Some states now or soon will effectively ban abortions, some will restrict them, and some will continue to offer legal access. Some have a right to abortion in their state constitutions. For example, it isn't accurate to talk broadly in our own voice in news articles about \"protecting\" abortion rights now that a federal constitutional right no longer exists. Such phrases are acceptable in people's quotations or job titles. It is more accurate to refer to a person who, or position that, supports or advocates for abortion rights or for legalized abortion. If referring to a constitutional right in a state or states, then it is appropriate to refer to the protection of those rights.</p><p>Abortion-rights and antiabortion are the preferred adjectives when describing advocates and campaigners on opposite sides of the issue. In U.S. states or countries that outlaw all or most abortions, a campaign is more accurately called a legalized-abortion movement. Avoid \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice,\" except when quoting someone. Late-term abortion or abortion later in pregnancy are more-neutral terms for what opponents of the practice call \"partial-birth abortions.\"</p><p>Overdone 'whom'</p><p>Perhaps out of fear of the grammar police, writers tend to use whom when they have a doubt about the who/whom choice. But often, who was the right call.</p><p>Two recent examples:</p><p>* Heather Kirkwood, a lawyer in Seattle who helps defend clients, typically pro bono, whom she believes are wrongly accused of AHT [abusive head trauma].</p><p>* …Abu Hamzah al Yemeni, whom the U.S. Central Command said was a senior leader of the Hurras al-Din organization.</p><p>In both cases, who was the right call, not whom. That is because in these cases, who refers to the subject. Ignore such distracting phrases as \"she believes\" in making this decision. The grammar trick is to stick with who if the sentence can be turned around to a question and the word replaced with he, she or they, rather than a him, her or them.</p><p>So, for the first example: Who is wrongly accused? They are, not them. So it's a who. (On the other hand, Hemingway fans, for whom does the bell toll? For them, of course. So that's why it's a whom.)</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* The new Treasury secretary is Lynn Malerba even though her formal name is Marilynn. She does business under the first name Lynn, so we recognize that, as we have for other politicians and officials including Jimmy (Carter) and Bill (Clinton).</p><p>* Amex, not AmEx, is how American Express Co. now capitalizes its abbreviation. (In the past, we worried about mixing up the abbreviations for American Express, then called AmEx, and the old American Stock Exchange, or Amex, but that isn't a worry now.)</p><p>* We sometimes slip up and use both past and present tenses on verbs within the same article. (Unless, of course, it is intentional to discuss present and past events.)</p><p>* Himars, not all-caps HIMARS, is how we capitalize the rocket-launch system that the U.S. supplied to Ukraine. It stands for high mobility artillery rocket system. Because it is pronounced (as HIGH-mars) and is more than four letters, it is an example of when we don't use all caps even if the entity that owns the name does it that way.</p><p>* We now spell terracotta as one word, an exception to Webster's 5th, for the clay or its earthy-tone color, rather than terra cotta or terra-cotta.</p><p>* Web3, with a capital W, is how we will spell the term for the idea of a new stage of the internet tied to blockchain technology.</p><p>* Immigrate and emigrate…. We sometimes mix them up in describing the movement of migrants. As our stylebook explains, one who leaves a country emigrates from it. One who comes into a country immigrates. The same holds for emigrant and immigrant. Don't use these terms for people who move within the same country; call them migrants. Speaking of which, the reason that immigration is a political issue isn't because of migrants but because of migrants who cross illegally (sometimes then seeking asylum).</p><p>Incentivize. Ugh.</p><p>We must say it again: Incentivize is hackneyed, best left to business jargon.</p><p>Examples, as noticed by reader David E. Gold, that continue to drag down our prose:</p><p>* They [SPAC investors] are incentivized to withdraw when share prices are low…</p><p>* Republicans pressed her on further incentivizing fossil fuels in the U.S.</p><p>* …part of a controversial strategy to disincentivize illegal immigration.</p><p>* PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan plans to incentivize players to stay on the tour.</p><p>There are plenty of conventional, and stronger, verbs that could be used instead: motivated to/encouraging/to discourage/to persuade.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Consumers Are Giving Inflation the Bird—With a Whole Chicken,\" ​ a group effort including Jennifer Levitz and Mitch Pacelle.</p><p>* \"A Survival Guide for Dealing With a Bad Boss / Life is too short to work for jerks. Here's what to do when your boss is a micromanager, bully or completely MIA,\" another group effort, and particularly noteworthy for the fun deck, by Rachel Feintzeig, Vanessa Fuhrmans and Nikki Waller.</p><p>Heads that make you go 'hmmm'</p><p>* Do we overuse \"How\" headlines? And how! They used to be a fun way to engage the reader, and we've all done them, but they are commonplace now. If the headline works just as well without the How, try to go without it. How a CEO Turned Her Worst Disaster Into Success can be as strong without the word: A CEO Turned Her Worst Disaster Into Success.</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* The Supreme Court has overruled Roe v. Wade. The decision eliminates the constitutional right to an abortion that had stood for half a century.</p><p>* She began to sob at the dinner table. She'd just returned from her daily Covid test, the only time her family could leave their 10th-floor apartment.</p><p>* One supermarket tried to completely do away with plastic. People stealing steak is where it started going wrong.</p><p>* America's most expensive homes used to get snapped up in days, but not anymore. The bubble is about to burst in one hot city.</p><p>* In the widest expansion of gun rights in a decade, the Supreme Court struck down a New York law on concealed weapons permits</p><p>* These Realtors weren't prepared for what they discovered when they opened the closet</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* A woman called a Credit Suisse hotline in 2020 to report allegedly inappropriate and disrespectful conduct by Mr. Chin toward women.</p><p>* In her mid-30s, breast cancer disrupted what looked like steady progress toward a chief executive appointment.</p><p>* If you are looking to fill your laser tag party, you could ask each of your close friends to invite another close friend of their own.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* If the conduct was only allegedly inappropriate, it's not being reported, only alleged. So, called the hotline to allege inappropriate conduct.</p><p>* A dangler. The cancer wasn't someone in her mid-30s.</p><p>* A close friend of his or her own. Or simply a close friend. Or keep the whole thing plural: …ask your close friends to invite close friends of their own. Our stylebook says the \"singular they\" (or their) still isn't good grammar except in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.</p><p>ISSN 1054-7041</p><p>Vol. 35, No. 6: Anonymity</p>",
