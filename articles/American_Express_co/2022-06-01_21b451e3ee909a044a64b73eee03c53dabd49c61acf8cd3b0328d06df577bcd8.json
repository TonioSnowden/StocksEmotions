  "title": "Tribeca Festival Signs Crypto Trading Desk OKX as Its New Top Sponsor; The cryptocurrency exchange platform, little known in Western markets, is a departure from previous presenting Tribeca sponsors American Express and AT&T and",
  "text": "<p>Beyond the festival itself, which runs from June 8 to June 19 in Manhattan, OKX Technology Inc. will provide year-round support for Tribeca programming around the U.S. and abroad, said the festival's co-founder and chief executive, Jane Rosenthal.</p><p>AT&amp;T took over from American Express as the festival's primary sponsor in 2014. Ms. Rosenthal and other organizers began looking for a new corporate sponsor as Tribeca's contract with AT&amp;T wound down, she said. They struck a deal with OKX based on its interest in new media formats, she said.</p><p>\"It felt like it was going to be the right fit for two companies that have an intention to drive forward new ways of storytelling and new ways of supporting artists in all different categories,\" Ms. Rosenthal said.</p><p>OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said that in the future, the two organizations could, for example, help sponsor the production of films designed for the metaverse while allowing creators to raise money on the blockchain and monetize their work with digital tokens.</p><p>The festival will feature a commemorative nonfungible token this year and plans to move further into NFTs in the years ahead, Ms. Rosenthal said.</p><p>\"We want to provide the tools to creators,\" Mr. Rafique said. \"Over the years to come, we will lean in, help them create these stories, and partner with hardware providers like Facebook.\"</p><p>The Tribeca Festival, which debuted in 2002 as a way to revive downtown Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, isn't new to the digital world. It began showcasing short films online in 2004, one year before the arrival of YouTube. And in 2011, it became the first film festival to preview a videogame, screening Rockstar Games' \"L.A. Noire\" to viewers ahead of its release.</p><p>The festival's offerings have expanded beyond traditional film in recent years to showcasing virtual-reality exhibits  and interactive multimedia installations. Last year, the festival dropped the word \"Film\" from its name .</p><p>OKX, which is now headquartered in the Seychelles, says it is the second-largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world by spot trading volume after Binance, but it has little brand recognition in Western markets. Its core trading products aren't currently available in the U.S. because the company lacks the necessary license, Mr. Rafique said.</p><p>OKX will use the sponsorship to promote its MetaX wallet, which is available in the U.S. and allows users to store items they have purchased from various Web3 platforms.</p><p>In recent weeks, OKX has signed sponsorship deals with Manchester City Football Club and McLaren Racing despite the recent upheaval in the global cryptocurrency market.</p><p>The company struck the Tribeca deal to create a long-term partnership with a respected brand, said Mr. Rafique, rather than grab attention with a big-budget celebrity ad campaign or a stadium-naming rights deal  as better-known crypto competitors have. The aim is to establish consumer trust in the OKX brand and alleviate any uncertainty among Western consumers that may stem from OKX's Chinese origins or its newcomer status in the market, he said.</p><p>OKX will use the Tribeca sponsorship to help teach filmmakers and fans how to use cryptocurrency and related Web3 technologies responsibly, rather than investing for short-term profits, said Mr. Rafique.</p><p>\"When you put your brand next to Tom Brady and Giselle and it doesn't have a meaning, it puts some pressure on us to do something where there is meaning,\" he said of his platform's participation in the festival.</p><p>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com </p><p>Tribeca Festival Signs Crypto Trading Desk OKX as Its New Top Sponsor</p>",
