  "text": "<p>Santander is aiming to become a cleaner proposition. The Spanish bank has <a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informacion-privilegiada/2021/08/hr-2021-08-24-definitive-agreement-pursuant-to-which-santander-holdings-usa-inc-shusa-will-acquire-all-outstanding-shares-of-common-stock-of-santander-consumer-usa-holdings.pdf\">upped an existing</a> offer to buy out minority shareholders of its listed US subsidiary Santander Consumer. A 6 per cent increase to $41.50 per share values the 20 per cent stake it does not own at $2.5bn. Acceptance is certain. Once completed, there will be one less stock ticker to flutter on the battlements of executive chair Ana Patricia Botin.</p> <p>Diversification is Santander's greatest strength. Global reach helped soften the blow from the pandemic. There is logic in linking Iberian and Latin American countries financially. But the hub and spoke structure looks outdated. Listed subsidiaries in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Poland impede a push for closer collaboration. </p> <p>A deal for Mexican shareholders is already on the table. Others will follow. The benefits of simplification should outweigh costs longer term. But Santander Group shareholders will take a hit this year.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Santander Consumer US specialises in car loans. The subprime lender is lower-rated than personal credit peers such as American Express and Capital One. Performance has been patchy, though shares have kept pace over three years. </p> <p>The unit has attracted criticisms. Multiple fines for poor practice have raised questions whether it fits well within staid Santander. But the boom in second-hand car sales meant it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2372ebaa-d37f-4292-a207-9299e1ba1aa9\">made the bulk</a> of group profits in the second quarter. Its countercyclical qualities lend support to Santander's diversification argument. </p> <p>Costing Santander just 10 basis points of common equity tier one, this is a capital efficient deal. Regulations mean Santander Group already absorbs a full risk weighting for only a partial equity holding.&#xa0;As such, the net hit to capital is just $700m rather than the full $2.5bn cash cost. </p> <p>A full buyout of Mexican minority shares would cost $550m or 8bp of CET1. Assuming both deals go through, CET1 will stand at 11.5 per cent, the middle of the bank's target range but low for a European bank. </p> <p>That may limit dividends. Paying out half of the theoretical 50bp maximum, on top of existing dividend allocations yields 6 per cent — in line with the average expected for European banks this year. </p> <p>To boost Santander's middling share rating, Botin needs to show that knitting the group more closely together increases margins and earnings growth. Or she may look as if she is simply reducing public scrutiny by removing foreign offshoots from local stock markets.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Santander: Botin must show a tighter structure boosts earnings' FT.com 24 August.
