  "title": "Stocks Waver After S&P 500 Record; All three major indexes on track for weekly gains",
  "text": "<p>All three major indexes are on track for weekly gains. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.7% this week, while the Dow has added 1.1%. The Nasdaq is up around 1.4%.</p><p>Stocks have risen in recent days after strong earnings results from some of the biggest U.S. corporations. Most S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings have beat analysts' expectations, and corporate profits are expected to jump around 35% in the latest quarter from the prior year, according to Refinitiv data.</p><p>The latest financial results from companies like Tesla and Procter &amp; Gamble showed that companies have been able to insulate themselves from the global supply-chain crisis and deliver strong results. Some companies have been passing down higher prices to customers.</p><p>\"It's still a solid backdrop for the stock market,\" said Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.</p><p>Market volatility has edged lower this week while investors have piled into the stock market. The Cboe Volatility Index closed at 15.01 Thursday, its lowest close since February 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 clinched another record. Some investors have turned to the options markets in recent sessions to wager on a continued stock rally.</p><p>While the broader market has been calmer in recent sessions, there have been big moves in individual stocks and other assets.</p><p>Investors have also piled into bitcoin, sending prices to a high this week after the first bitcoin ETF started trading.</p><p>Digital World Acquisition, the blank-check company taking the new social network of former President Donald Trump public, more than doubled in a frenetic trading session. The shares were halted at least six times in trading Friday and are now up more than 1,000% this week, a lurch higher that is unusual even for SPACs, which tend to be volatile.</p><p>The shares have far outperformed an ETF tracking SPACs, the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, which has gained around 0.2% this week. Chatter about the shares permeated Reddit and Twitter.</p><p>On Friday, American Express shares rose around 5% after the credit-card company posted a rise in earnings that beat analysts forecasts, in part helped by more consumers dining out.</p><p>Snap shares fell around 25%, on track for the largest one-day fall on record, after the social-media company said changes to Apple's privacy rules would hurt its ad business. Other technology shares also slipped, with Facebook falling more than 5% and Google parent company Alphabet down 3.3%.</p><p>And recent earnings showed that some companies are struggling with parts shortages. Intel shares fell more than 11% after the chip maker posted earnings late Thursday. Component shortages are weighing on Intel's computer shipments and China's gaming crackdown is hurting sales of chips used in servers.</p><p>China Evergrande Group, the heavily indebted property giant whose potential default had spooked markets, made an overdue interest payment to international bondholders, Chinese state-owned media reported Friday. The payment allowed the company to stave off default and helped ease investors' broader concerns about China's property sector.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury hovered around 1.640% Friday from 1.674% Thursday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.4% to $84.93 a barrel.</p><p>\"Currently, we see the challenges in energy, product and labor markets as transitory rather than the makings of a new 'stagflationary' economic regime,\" wrote Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Thursday.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%, led by its technology sector. Asian stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com.</p><p>Stocks Waver After S&amp;P 500 Record</p>",
