  "text": "<p>The financial services company posted third-quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.27 a share, up from $1.1 billion, or $1.30 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.80 a share.</p><p>American Express's AXP revenue net of interest expense grew to $10.9 billion from $8.8 billion, while analysts had been modeling $10.5 billion. Cardholder spending on goods and services accelerated and was up 19% relative to the third quarter of 2019, the company disclosed in its release.</p><p>The stock rose 2.6% in premarket trading Friday.</p><p>The company benefited from a “a continued rebound in travel and entertainment spending,” Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in the release. Restaurant spending was “notably resilient” and showed growth above pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>He also highlighted that Amex has made progress with its efforts to attract younger customers, with spending by millennial and Gen-Z cardholders up 38% compared with the third quarter of 2019. The company acquired 2.6 million new proprietary cards in the quarter and saw “all-time highs” in acquisitions of U.S. consumer and small-business Platinum and Gold cards.</p><p>The company's traction with younger cardholders reflects work over the past few years to “pivot the value proposition” and make it so that card benefits reflect the interests of millennial and Gen-Z spenders, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell told MarketWatch.</p><p>While the company offered some temporary benefits, like wireless credits, during the trough of the pandemic when people weren't traveling, Amex has largely wound those down by now. Still, Campbell said that customers who once took advantage of the temporarily benefits are still spending in those categories even though Amex has ended those offers.</p><p>Overall, the company sees “tremendous growth momentum,” according to Campbell. “For both consumers and small businesses, we're increasingly confident that there's been a permanent shift in the use of digital payment methods.”</p><p>Amex is “confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of the EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022,” Squeri said in the company's press release.</p><p>The company's consolidated provisions for credit losses amounted to a $191 million benefit in the third quarter, whereas the company saw a provision expense of $665 million in the year-earlier period. Amex noted that the change largely reflected $393 million in credit reserve releases as well as lower net write-offs during the most recent period.</p><p>Shares of American Express have added 3.8% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has risen 2.2%.</p>",
