  "text": "<p>It wasn't the right strategy for 2021, when the Dogs generated a 16% return, underperforming the 21% rise for the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the 29% rise for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX.</p><p>But now the Dogs have some bite, at least in relative terms. The Dogs so far have returned 1%, outperforming their noncanine Dow counterparts that have dropped 6%, and the S&amp;P 500, which has retreated by 9%. Then again, an investor can just go to cash and get similar returns without any risk.</p><p> Ticker  Company                          Yield at end-21  YTD change  DOW     Dow                              4.94%            6.1%  VZ      Verizon Communications           4.93%            -1.5%  IBM     International Business Machines  4.91%            -0.8%  CVX     Chevron                          4.57%            15.5%  WBA     Walgreens Boots Alliance         3.66%            -3.5%  MRK     Merck                            3.60%            5.1%  AMGN    Amgen                            3.45%            -0.4%  MMM     3M                               3.33%            -3.2%  KO      Coca-Cola                        2.84%            0.7%  INTC    Intel                            2.70%            -6.4%  Source: Dogs of the Dow website</p><p>This year has marked the widest gap in returns between the Dogs and the broad Dow 30 through the first 18 trading days of the year since 2001, says Jake Gordon, an analyst at Bespoke Investment Group.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Apple AAPL rose 3% in premarket trade reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales well ahead of estimates, as its CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that it expected revenue in the current quarter to grow.
