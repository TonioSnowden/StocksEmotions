  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Amex Cardholder Spending Rises  ----  By Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>   American Express Co. said spending among its cardholders continued to strengthen in the recently ended quarter, despite concerns over rising prices and fears of a recession. </p><p>   The credit-card company said second-quarter revenue rose 31% as cardholder spending on travel and entertainment topped prepandemic levels in April and has continued to improve. </p><p>   \"Travel and entertainment spending just exploded this quarter with all the pent-up demand,\" American Express Finance Chief Jeff Campbell said, adding that spending on goods and services didn't show any signs of slowing. </p><p>   Overall cardholder spending rose 30% from a year earlier when adjusted for currency effects, as consumers and businesses resumed travel plans that were on hold the last two years. </p><p>   Spending on airlines surged 148% in the quarter, Mr. Campbell said, while spending on restaurants and lodging rose 48% and 90%, respectively. Spending on goods and services, which makes up the majority of the company's volume, rose 18%. </p><p>   A rebound in corporate travel, which has been slower to return than leisure travel, helped drive the growth, Mr. Campbell said. Corporate travel isn't back to prepandemic levels, he said, but \"as we look ahead to the fall, I think you'll see a full resumption.\" </p><p>   The results show that spending remains robust, even as inflation is now at the highest levels in more than four decades and interest rates are rising. Mr. Campbell said American Express primarily serves premium customers who might be less exposed to inflation than lower-income consumers. </p><p>   For the second quarter, American Express posted revenue of $13.4 billion on the higher spending, topping Wall Street expectations for $12.51 billion. Shares of American Express rose 1.9% Friday to $153.01. </p><p>   Along with the increase in travel spending, the New York City-based credit-card company said it saw customers step up usage of travel-related benefits, which pushed expenses 32% higher from a year earlier. </p><p>   American Express raised its full-year revenue guidance to growth of 23% to 25%, from a prior range of 18% to 20%. The company maintained its full-year earnings guidance. </p><p>   American Express's profit fell about 14% to $1.96 billion, or $2.57 a share, from $2.28 billion, or $2.80 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a larger decline in profit to $2.42 a share, according to FactSet. </p><p>   The drop was largely attributed to a swing in the company's provision for credit losses, which came to $410 million for the quarter, compared with a benefit of $606 million a year earlier. American Express said the change reflects a small net reserve build compared with a $866 million reserve release a year ago. </p><p></p>",
