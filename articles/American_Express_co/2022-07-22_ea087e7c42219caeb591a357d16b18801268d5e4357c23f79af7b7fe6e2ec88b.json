  "title": "American Express Revenue Up 31% as Spending Remains Robust; Credit-card company says travel, entertainment spending back to prepandemic levels",
  "text": "<p>\"Travel and entertainment spending just exploded this quarter with all the pent-up demand,\" American Express Finance Chief Jeff Campbell said, adding that spending on goods and services didn't show any signs of slowing.</p><p>Overall cardholder spending rose 30% from a year earlier when adjusted for currency effects, as consumers and businesses resumed travel plans that were on hold the last two years.</p><p>Spending on airlines surged 148% in the quarter, Mr. Campbell said, while spending on restaurants and lodging rose 48% and 90%, respectively. Spending on goods and services, which makes up the majority of the company's volume, rose 18%.</p><p>\"As travel and entertainment spend has picked up, people haven't said, 'Oh, now I got to stop spending at retailers or in other areas,'\" Mr. Campbell said.</p><p>A rebound in corporate travel, which has been slower to return than leisure travel, helped drive the growth, Mr. Campbell said. Corporate travel isn't back to prepandemic levels, he said, but \"as we look ahead to the fall, I think you'll see a full resumption.\"</p><p>The results show that spending remains robust, even as inflation is now at the highest levels in more than four decades and interest rates are rising. Mr. Campbell said American Express primarily serves premium customers who might be less exposed to inflation than lower-income consumers.</p><p>While some companies have warned that inflation is hitting sentiment among older Americans particularly hard, Mr. Campbell said spending has only picked up in this group of cardholders. Spending among baby boomers surpassed prepandemic levels for the first time during the recently ended quarter, he said. Spending by millennial and Gen Z cardholders jumped 48%.</p><p>For the second quarter, American Express posted revenue of $13.4 billion on the higher spending, topping Wall Street expectations for $12.51 billion.</p><p>Shares of American Express rose more than 4% in premarket trading to $156.84 a share.</p><p>Along with the increase in travel spending, the New York City-based credit-card company said it saw customers step up usage of travel-related benefits, which pushed expenses 32% higher from a year earlier.</p><p>American Express raised its full-year revenue guidance to growth of 23% to 25%, from a prior range of 18% to 20%. The company maintained its full-year earnings guidance.</p><p>For the quarter ended June 30, American Express's profit fell about 14% to $1.96 billion, or $2.57 a share, from $2.28 billion, or $2.80 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a larger decline in profit to $2.42 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>The drop was largely attributed to a swing in the company's provision for credit losses, which came to $410 million for the quarter, compared with a benefit of $606 million a year earlier. American Express said the change reflects a small net reserve build compared with a $866 million reserve release a year ago.</p><p>Mr. Campbell said the swing in the credit-loss provision reflected the company's return to a more normalized environment, and doesn't indicate concerns about credit stress. The charge \"is still far below what you would have seen in a normal quarter prepandemic,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>American Express Revenue Up 31% as Spending Remains Robust</p>",
