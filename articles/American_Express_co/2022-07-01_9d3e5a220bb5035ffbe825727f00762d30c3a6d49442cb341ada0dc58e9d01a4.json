  "text": "<p>The Marine Band, formed in 1798 and known as \"The President's Own,\" performed (and still plays) often at the White House. When the younger Sousa became its conductor at age 25, he recruited woodwinds to balance the blaring brass instruments, expanded its repertoire by transcribing symphonic works, and led meticulous rehearsals. Under the perfectionist Sousa, it became the foremost and best-known musical ensemble in America.</p><p>Sousa's career coincided with the golden age of bands in America. By one count, in 1889, the U.S. had more than 10,000. They formed in cities and villages, army posts, factories and fraternal lodges. In those days before electrical phonographs and radio, a band concert or parade, replete with volume, variety and gleaming instruments, electrified the public as nothing else.</p><p>Like dance music, the march was all about bodily movement. Sousa said that he wrote \"music for the feet instead of the head\"—whether those feet were tapping, dancing, or marching. His \"Semper Fidelis\" and \"The Washington Post\" brought him national attention as a composer, and he was dubbed \"The March King.\" His recurring theme was patriotism; his marches matched the national spirit, which was upbeat and expansive.</p><p>Leaving the Marine Band in 1892, he formed his own concert ensemble, the Sousa Band, which toured widely in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>The idea for \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" came to Sousa as he was sailing back to the U.S. after a European vacation. He evidently completed the score on Dec. 25, 1896, and it was published in 1897. It became Sousa's most famous composition and by act of Congress in 1987, the official march of the U.S.</p><p>Sousa's gifts for originality, lively contrast, inventive rhythms, inspired orchestration and memorable melody are on full display in \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" Three of its four strains have hummable tunes. The third strain features a syncopated bass line and a lyrical, singable melody—and when it repeats, it offers a dazzling countermelody, the most famous of all piccolo solos. The fourth strain contrasts markedly: no tuneful melody, but rather a \"dogfight\" between lower and upper voices, seeming to fly like a skyrocket and descend to earth. To close the piece, the third strain returns grandioso, with percussion at full blast and countermelodies in the trombones and piccolos, going out with glory. What could better express American optimism and verve?</p><p>\"Stars and Stripes\" became such a part of the national soundtrack that send-ups were inevitable. Its lyrics, written by Sousa himself—\"Hurrah for the flag of the free\"—have been parodied several times. \"Be kind to your web-footed friends,\" goes one version. The music has been spoofed, too: \"Manualist\" John Twomeymade a comical, rather rude wordless interpretation using only his two hands.</p><p>\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" became a staple of nearly every concert, school, marching and military band in the nation. Other instrumentalists adopted it, too. In the early years of the 20th century, such ragtime and early jazz pianists as Eubie Blakeand Jelly Roll Morton reinterpreted \"Stars and Stripes.\" To celebrate attaining American citizenship, the Russian-born classical pianist Vladimir Horowitz arranged it for his instrument.</p><p>But you don't have to be American to appreciate the piece, as Sousa's foreign audiences proved: In 1903, his band performed as far afield as Russia. \"Stars and Stripes\" was even highlighted in the U.S.S.R. when the Massed Bands of the Soviet Army played it from memory and the audience stood up and clapped along in rhythm.</p><p>By the end of its nearly 40-year run, the Sousa Band had performed more than 15,000 concerts—almost always including \"Stars and Stripes.\" A master showman and sharp businessman, by the end of his life Sousa became wealthy, especially from sheet-music sales.</p><p>Sousa left a legacy of 136 marches, numerous operettas, and the sousaphone (a large bass tuba whose design he suggested). He pioneered as a recording artist, championed the rights of composers, lifted the performance practices of bands across America, introduced syncopated dance music—ragtime—to France and earned American music new respect abroad.</p><p>This Fourth of July, during a day of parades, baseball and barbecues, somewhere, close by, a marching band surely will be playing John Philip Sousa's most American of marches, as we anticipate the rockets' red glare in the night sky and commemorate together another year of American democracy.</p><p>Mr. Hasse is curator emeritus of American music at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. His books include \"Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington\" (Da Capo) and \"Discover Jazz\" (Pearson).</p><p>Patriotism, Optimism and Energy in Overdrive</p>",
