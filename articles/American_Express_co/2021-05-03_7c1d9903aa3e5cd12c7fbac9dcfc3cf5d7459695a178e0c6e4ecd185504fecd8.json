  "title": "U.S. News -- Obituary: Gruff Billionaire Spread His Wealth",
  "text": "<p>After earning billions by building homes and selling annuities, Eli Broad devoted his life to making gifts to support art museums, K-12 education and biomedical research. Along the way, he developed a reputation for being gruff and impatient.</p><p>Mr. Broad, who died Friday in Los Angeles at the age of 87, acknowledged that he could be difficult. He entitled his 2012 memoir \"The Art of Being Unreasonable.\" Being unreasonable, he said, was the key to his success: He had huge ambitions, the confidence to \"ignore people who said I couldn't do it\" and the discipline to avoid wasting time on lengthy debates.</p><p>His philanthropy left a major cultural mark on his adopted hometown of Los Angeles, where he led fundraising for the Walt Disney Concert Hall designed by Frank Gehry, served as founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art and founded another contemporary-art museum, The Broad, featuring many of the works collected by Mr. Broad and his wife, Edye.</p><p>He amazed more traditional art buyers in 1994 by using his American Express card to pay Sotheby's $2.48 million for Roy Lichtenstein's \"I. . .I'm Sorry\" comic-book style painting. That purchase earned millions of frequent-flier miles, donated by Mr. Broad to art students. The real reason for paying with a card, he said, was to continue earning interest on his cash until the monthly bill came due.</p><p>An only child, Eli Broad was born June 6, 1933, in New York. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. His father, Leon Broad, painted houses, and his mother, Rita Broad, was a seamstress.</p><p>In 1940, the family moved to Detroit. Leon Broad opened a dime store there, and his wife kept the books. Because he lacked siblings and had busy parents, young Eli was often alone. That solitude conferred some advantages, he wrote in his memoir: He learned self-reliance and never needed approval from others, \"so I didn't develop the habit of wanting it.\"</p><p>He decided the family name should rhyme with \"road\" rather than \"rod,\" and the new pronunciation stuck.</p><p>After training as an accountant, Mr. Broad joined Donald Kaufman to found a home-building company, Kaufman &amp; Broad, in 1956. The company, now known as KB Home, focused on first-time buyers and built no-frills houses without basements so they could be priced lower. \"There were no architects' fees because I designed the floor plan myself,\" Mr. Broad wrote.</p><p>In 1971, KB bought a small life insurance company in the hope that its steady earnings would help smooth out housing busts. The insurance company evolved into a major marketer of annuities. American International Group Inc. agreed to buy SunAmerica in 1998 for $18 billion.</p><p>Mr. Broad's support for education included funding for charter schools, training of superintendents and prizes for improvements in urban education. He donated more than $1 billion to create a genomic-medicine research center in Cambridge, Mass.</p><p>Mr. Broad is survived by his wife and two sons. He made no apologies for avoiding anything, such as chitchat, golf or long meetings, that he saw as a waste of time. When he grew exasperated with discussions, he sometimes interjected, \"Anything else?\" Longtime colleagues learned that was the end of the discussion, not an invitation to share more thoughts.</p>",
