  "title": "Hertz Says Tesla Is Delivering Cars to Fleet, Elon Musk Says There Is No Signed Deal; Shares of electric-vehicle maker slide after topping $1 trillion in market value in recent days",
  "text": "<p>A Hertz spokeswoman Tuesday stood by the company's earlier announcement. She said deliveries of Tesla have already started. A link on Hertz's website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3.</p><p>\"As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging infrastructure across the company's global operations,\" the Hertz spokeswoman said. \"We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet.\"</p><p>Mr. Musk and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comments.</p><p>The company didn't put out a press release when Hertz initially announced the deal on Oct. 25. Commenting on last week's announcement, Mr. Musk tweeted: \"Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem.\" He added in a separate tweet: \"To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers.\"</p><p>Tesla shares dropped 3% on Tuesday. Hertz shares, which trade over the counter, opened sharply lower but erased losses and closed up 2.7%.</p><p>The seemingly conflicting messages between Mr. Musk and Hertz cast into the spotlight the relationships between auto makers and rental-car companies. Typically, rental-car companies strike their contracts with car makers at the start of a new model year so that their orders are baked into production plans early on, according to industry analysts. Most rental fleet buys are initiated in the first quarter of the year before the busy summer travel months.</p><p>These contracts tend to be fairly malleable and details such as volume and price can continue to be negotiated after a contract is struck, analysts say. For instance, many orders have been canceled or reduced this year as the auto industry grapples with a global shortage of semiconductors.</p><p>\"It's not beyond the realm of reality that something like the volume number could still change,\" said Ivan Drury, an analyst for car-shopping website Edmunds.com.</p><p>Financial terms of the deal between Hertz and Tesla weren't provided during last month's announcement. Based on list prices of the Model 3 , the cost to Hertz would top $4 billion.</p><p>Tesla wasn't providing any bulk discount to Hertz for the purchase, and Hertz would buy the vehicles based on prevailing market prices, people familiar with the matter said last week.</p><p>Shortly after Hertz exited from bankruptcy in June, representatives of the company's new owners approached Tesla with the goal of placing a big bulk order for its rental-car fleet, the people familiar said. The Hertz team spent months negotiating with Tesla as they worked toward reaching a deal, the people said.</p><p>Hertz confronted the challenge of refilling its fleet as demand for its services rebounded and the continuing semiconductor shortage hampered the automotive manufacturing industry. The company also aimed to fulfill a growing demand for electric vehicles, from both corporate clients looking for green options, as well as everyday rental customers and ride-hailing drivers, they said.</p><p>Hertz's largest new shareholder, travel-focused private-equity firm Certares Management LLC, had conducted research that found corporate clients were willing to pay a substantial premium to have their employees drive electric vehicles, because many of them have stated intent to get to carbon neutral. Certares, which also owns American Express Global Business Travel and Tripadvisor Inc., could also see from its various platforms that customers had begun to pivot away from gas-guzzling SUVs and were increasingly requesting electric vehicles, one of the people said.</p><p>Rather than buying the cars using cash from Hertz's own balance sheet the purchases would be conducted through Hertz's special-purpose subsidiaries, which issue bonds to finance the purchase of new cars, with the vehicles serving as collateral for the bond investors, they said.</p><p>When Hertz emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy it eliminated nearly $5 billion in debt through its financial restructuring and secured a $2.8 billion exit credit facility. The company's total liquidity as of June 30 was about $3 billion, consisting of a mixture of cash and availability on its credit lines, according to company filings.</p><p>In the Hertz announcement last month, it said it was partnering with NFL quarterback Tom Brady to promote Hertz's EV campaign. Hertz's online press release included a video interview with Mr. Brady discussing his experiences with EVs.</p><p>Tesla shares soared after the Hertz announcement, topping $1 trillion in market value. Mr. Musk's personal net worth also exceeded $300 billion in the days following the announcement and was recently $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>Hertz shares rose 38% since the Tesla deal was announced on Oct. 25 through Monday's close. Hertz's shares have been traded over the counter since the companywas delisted in the summer of 2020.</p><p>Hertz had said that Tesla Model 3s would be available for customers to rent in some markets beginning in early November. It said electric vehicles would comprise more than 20% of its global fleet including the Tesla order.</p><p>Rental-car companies including Hertz have struggled to meet demand as post-vaccination travel ramped up and as a semiconductor shortage stalled vehicle production.</p><p>Sales to rental-car fleets are often viewed as a liability for auto makers. While the business can help expose people to brands they may not have previously considered buying, overreliance on selling cars to rental-car fleets over time can hurt a brand's image and dent resale values, analysts and auto executives say.</p><p>Mr. Musk's latest tweet comes as his actions on social media have been closely scrutinized in recent years. A 2018 Securities and Exchange Commission investigation alleged that Mr. Musk misled investors by tweeting about a potential buyout of Tesla when he posted \"funding secured\" on Twitter. Mr. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million to settle that case. Mr. Musk agreed to have his statements overseen by Tesla lawyers.</p><p>He criticized the regulatory agency after the settlement, saying, \"I want to be clear, I do not respect the SEC,\" but said he would abide by the terms of the settlement \"because I respect the justice system.\"</p><p>SEC regulators told Tesla in 2019 and 2020 that Mr. Musk sent tweets that hadn't undergone the required preapproval by Tesla's lawyers, the Journalreported earlier this year.</p><p>Charles Elson, a University of Delaware finance professor who specializes in corporate governance, said Mr. Musk's tweet could spark an SEC inquiry.</p><p>\"If Hertz says there's a deal and Musk says there's no deal, that's certainly something the SEC could look into,\" Mr. Elson said. \"It affects both companies' equity value.\"</p><p>The SEC didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>â€”Alexander Saeedy contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com, Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com and Nora Naughton at nora.naughton@wsj.com</p><p>Hertz Says Tesla Is Delivering Cars to Fleet, Elon Musk Says There Is No Signed Deal</p>",
