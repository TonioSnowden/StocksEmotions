  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report) --- What's Keeping Black Workers From Moving Up the Corporate Ladder? Companies have devoted a lot of attention to diversity in hiring and promotions. A new study offers clues as to why the efforts have fallen short -- and what can be done to change that.",
  "text": "<p>Yet Black employees are leaving early-career jobs in high numbers -- often, they say, because they feel little support or opportunity to advance, according to new research by McKinsey &amp; Co. Those losses offset many of the small gains companies have made in recruiting and promoting Black professionals and mean even fewer of them are positioned to make the leap from entry-level white-collar jobs into management and executive roles. Black workers make up 12% of the entry-level jobs, but their numbers shrink to 7% just one step up the career ladder into first management roles.</p><p>This is true not only in corporate jobs, but also in low-paying hourly jobs in the stores, warehouses and call centers of major companies, where many Black Americans work but find few bridges to supervisory roles and other jobs with more career potential. From 19% of hourly jobs, Black workers make up 13% of higher-level, salaried roles in the field. By contrast, whites start out as 52% of hourly field workers but make up 60% of all salaried field employees.</p><p>Those are some of the findings of one of the most comprehensive examinations to date of the Black experience in the corporate world. Conducted by McKinsey in partnership with Walmart Inc., the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and PolicyLink, a nonprofit that focuses on economic and racial-equity issues, the study includes a first-ever look at internal data on the hires, promotions and career arcs of nearly four million employees at two dozen of the country's biggest companies, as well as analyses of the labor markets they operate in and the broader Black employment picture in the U.S. As part of the study, McKinsey researchers also surveyed 25,000 employees of all races at those companies on their workplace perceptions and experiences.</p><p>The numbers suggest that one reason for the lack of headway is that companies' efforts have benefited a relatively small pool, and failed to address the issues fueling attrition among Black employees. Companies have made strides in elevating some Black leaders in their most senior ranks: The share of Blacks on executive teams is slightly higher than in middle management and nearly doubles at the boardroom level, to 11%. Yet such efforts have largely failed to trickle down to the hundreds of thousands of entry-level workers toward the bottom of the corporate pyramid.</p><p>And although business leaders are paying closer attention to the numbers of Blacks moving in, up and out of their workforces, the data shows the lived experience of Black workers and managers remains worse than that of their colleagues.</p><p>While Black employees surveyed by McKinsey overwhelmingly report a sense of purpose and accomplishment from their work, half say they feel they receive little or no support to advance their careers, compared with an average of about 40% for all other groups. While many employees believe the workplace isn't a meritocracy -- only half of all workers say they believe promotions are based on performance -- for Blacks, such skepticism is more widely held: Just 29% say they think promotions are merit-based. Meanwhile, Blacks, at 48%, are nearly twice as likely as other minorities to perceive that their race makes it harder to achieve their career goals.</p><p>\"People are coming into organizations with great enthusiasm and great interest, and then what happens is they don't find the mentorship, the sponsorship and the opportunity that they see others receiving,\" says Ron Williams, the former chairman and chief executive of Aetna who currently sits on the boards of Boeing Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Express Co. A big flashpoint is that first chance to break into the management ranks, where too often, he says, he has seen hiring bosses rely on their comfort level or preconceived ideas of who is the right fit rather than a talent-management approach that applies the same rigor and objective criteria that companies use to launch products.</p><p>\"It's where careers are made or broken,\" he says, nodding to the few Black executives who have filtered all the way to the top as a case in point. \"I'm a very good executive, but I'm not one of just 23, 24 people who are African-American who had the capability to run a major company. There are a lot of people like me. But we waste a lot of talent.\"</p><p>What headway companies are making in supporting and advancing Black employees is so slow that at the current trajectory in promotion and hiring rates, McKinsey researchers calculate it would take nearly a century for every level of the corporate pyramid to mirror the Black share of the total population. But by tackling key barriers, such as higher attrition and lower odds for career advancement among Black workers, companies could reach that milestone in 25 years, says Lareina Yee, a senior partner at McKinsey and the firm's diversity and inclusion chief.</p><p>\"What it shows is the road to equality isn't a one- or two-year corporate program,\" but a systematic, multiyear approach, Ms. Yee says. \"It's not just about hiring 10 extra people from a historically Black college,\" she adds. \"It's also about creating a culture that if you recruit them that they want to stay.\"</p><p>What's more, beyond the growing political, social and investor pressure to create more inclusive workplaces, \"it's becoming a brand strategy,\" says Talia Fox, CEO of KUSI Global Inc., a Washington-based leadership-development firm that also advises companies on changing workplace cultures.</p><p>\"A lot of millennial high-performing talent ask us, even as a Black-owned company, 'What are you doing around social and racial justice?' \" she says. At other companies, \"I've talked to some hiring managers where candidates have walked out of the room if the answer was, 'We don't have a plan but we're working on it.' \"</p><p>Rachelle C. Olden, a 37-year-old global experiential marketing manager at Microsoft Corp., says she turned down competing offers at two other major tech companies three years ago. As a Black woman in technology, and thus often the only Black person in the room, she says it was especially important to find a supportive work culture.</p><p>\"One way I knew this was a good place is I didn't feel afraid about calling out my team, as well as the company, on their lack of diversity,\" says Ms. Olden, who says she is one of three Black employees on a team of 100 marketers. \"And they never made excuses. They were like, 'You're right. How do we do better?' \"</p><p>Certain gestures, even when small, have been meaningful, she says, such as when a senior white executive in a group video chat corrected someone who had mispronounced her name or when another leader asked last year if she would be interested in a \"reverse mentorship\" relationship with him. The two meet via video regularly to swap and learn from each others' experiences. \"These are the things that add up and make me feel included,\" she says.</p><p>Many Black employees report feeling otherwise at work. Those surveyed by McKinsey were less likely than their white peers to say they feel they can speak up, present ideas or share details about themselves and their lives outside of work. And while a majority of all employees surveyed by McKinsey say their company's diversity efforts are effective, one-third of Black employees agree.</p><p>Many companies in recent years have tried to address the lack of diversity when hiring and promoting. All of the companies in the study say they provide antibias training for hiring managers, two-thirds require racially diverse slates of job candidates to be considered for all positions, and 41% say hiring panels themselves must be diverse.</p><p>But such moves often have limited impact, some executives say. During Herb Dyer's time as the chief operating officer of a Seton Family of Hospitals acute medical facility in Austin, Texas, a role he held from 2009 to 2013, hiring managers would often interview candidates of different backgrounds, he says. But the practice didn't necessarily lead to more diverse hires.</p><p>\"It was just going through the motions,\" says Mr. Dyer, who says he would try to raise the issue without being confrontational. \"I'd say, 'Look, I'm not telling you you need to hire an African-American for every position, but you need to look at other than what is traditional.' \"</p><p>As a 6-foot-3, 220-pound Black man, he says, he was personally aware of the kinds of stereotypes that can influence such decisions: At one point in his career, a white supervisor assumed he'd been a professional athlete; in performance evaluations, he occasionally got feedback from colleagues suggesting he was intimidating.</p><p>\"It super bothered me because I thought I did all the right things in being respectful, treating people well,\" says Mr. Dyer, who now has his own consulting firm.</p><p>Nick Ragone, executive vice president of Ascension, the parent company of Ascension Seton, formerly Seton Family of Hospitals, says the organization condemns \"all forms of racism, discrimination and injustice as we work together to ensure our associates and patients are treated justly and respectfully.\"</p><p>Even in supportive workplaces, some Black professionals say they often feel the burden of being a standard-bearer for their race. Karen Henry, 53, became an attorney at national law firm Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in her mid-30s after more than a decade working as a Los Angeles Superior Court supervisor and clerk with a paralegal degree. A judge-turned-mentor had pushed her to go to law school.</p><p>At the firm, she says, she found strong professional support in honing her legal skills. Still, as the only Black attorney in the firm's L.A. office when she joined, \"I told myself that if I mess this up, they're never going to hire another Black lawyer.\"</p><p>Her answer, Ms. Henry says, was to burrow into the work, aim to write the best briefs, and over time, more Black attorneys did join the office. Yet she says her focus on perfecting her legal skills hurt her ability to network and bring in business, and she worried how asking for help inside the firm would look.</p><p>\"As an African-American attorney, do I really want to step up and say, 'I'm having trouble with this'?\" she says she asked herself. Instead, she turned to an outside mentoring network for midcareer women, whose guidance helped her boost her profitability. \"It's what I needed to have candid conversations about getting where I wanted to be,\" she says.</p><p>In the wake of the racial-equity movement set off by the death of George Floyd in police custody, the killing of Breonna Taylor and other prominent cases involving Black Americans and police, some business leaders are redoubling efforts to create more career opportunities for Black people. Best Buy Co., whose headquarters is just miles from where Mr. Floyd was killed, pledged in December to fill one out of every three new salaried corporate jobs with people of color and increase retention with more career support.</p><p>Target Corp., also based nearby, has committed to boosting the representation of Black employees across the company by 20% over the next three years and creating new career pathways -- in part because, as company officials drilled more deeply into employee data by race, it saw Black employees in many areas were leaving at higher rates than others.</p><p>\"That tells you there's something systemic about the experience,\" says Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief diversity and inclusion officer, who says that both promotion data and employee surveys suggested Black employees wanted more career routes up and across the company. CEO Brian Cornell says having an effective strategy is critical to innovating for the retailer's diverse customer base. \"Simply put, we believe diverse and inclusive teams are the most successful,\" he says.</p><p>Companies are also joining forces. A coalition of more than 30 CEOs from companies including Merck &amp; Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Nike Inc. are backing a startup, called OneTen, aimed at creating one million \"family sustaining\" jobs for Black Americans within a decade. The initiative, which will focus on helping those without a college degree train, find and retain jobs at the participating companies, is an acknowledgment by the CEOs that their racial-diversity efforts haven't made a meaningful difference for Black Americans, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, a OneTen founder, has said. One of just a handful of Black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies, Mr. Frazier is retiring in June.</p><p>Part of the challenge in drawing more Black workers into upwardly mobile positions will be bridging the job-opportunity gap that exists well before many find their way into company workplaces. Blacks face higher unemployment and underemployment than other Americans, even among those with a college education, according to government data.</p><p>Another issue is geography: Nearly 60% of the Black labor force lives in the South, federal data shows, while far fewer Blacks live in the West, where much of the booming tech industry is. In California, for example, less than 6% of the population is Black. Black populations are also relatively small in the kinds of cities expected to see the most job growth over the next decade, according to McKinsey, such as big new-economy hubs like Seattle and Austin; fast-growing second-tier cities like Provo, Utah; and areas seeing big inflows of middle-class and affluent seniors, such as Prescott, Ariz., and Ocean City, Md.</p><p>Failing to address the gap is likely to widen the wealth disparity between Blacks and other Americans. Among Black private-sector workers, 43% earn less than $30,000 a year, compared with 31% of all employees, in part because they make up far more of low-paying service and laborer jobs, especially in the retail and hospitality sectors, the McKinsey data shows -- industries that have been especially devastated by the pandemic. Looking ahead, their high concentration in those fields puts 23% of jobs held by Black workers at risk of being displaced by automation over the next decade, McKinsey estimates, slightly more than whites and employees of Asian descent and slightly lower than the 25% for Hispanics.</p><p>The relatively few Black professionals who make it into upper management fare better at promotions than those in earlier career stages, the McKinsey data shows. In the first half of last year, Black men, in particular, were promoted at higher rates than their white peers to senior positions, with the exception of executive teams. Still, the gains are uneven, partly because the numbers are so small. Virtually no Black women at the senior vice president level were promoted during that same period within the two dozen companies McKinsey studied.</p><p>Gwen Kelly, now in her 60s, says that throughout her marketing career she often felt she was two to three promotions behind her white peers. Before she was recruited by an ad agency to serve in her first director-level position, she says, the firm first discussed the decision with a major client. \"They wanted to gauge their reaction,\" she says.</p><p>Later she worked in insurance and then for Walmart, first as a marketing executive and ultimately in the company's diversity office. But her discussions with managers about advancing further didn't lead to higher positions, though she says she often did more senior-level work.</p><p>Though she saw some Black women rise through the ranks, Ms. Kelly says she lacked higher-up sponsors who could champion her for bigger roles. \"You can't say there weren't people like that. I just wasn't the one that was chosen,\" she says, adding that she also didn't know how to seek out such advocates. \"There's ignorance on both sides,\" says Ms. Kelly, who left Walmart in 2018 and is now a marketing consultant in Bentonville, Ark.</p><p>Walmart says it has been expanding its efforts to bolster diversity through its ranks, including, in more recent years, requiring that both internal and external shortlists for senior roles include at least one woman or person of color and making it easier for employees to find sponsors. It also is publishing more detailed breakdowns of the racial and ethnic makeup of its workforce on all levels.</p><p>\"We're not going to move the needle if we're not all transparent,\" says Donna Morris, Walmart's chief people officer. In the first half of Walmart's past fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, Black employees, who make up 11.6% of managers, got 17% of all promotions from one management level to another and 18% of promotions from hourly jobs to manager roles.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, more than 25,000 Walmart employees -- 47% of them people of color -- have participated in Live Better U, a company-sponsored online higher-education program Walmart founded in 2018. For $1 a day, employees can enroll in online courses and earn degrees and trade certificates putting them on track for higher-level jobs.</p><p>One is 34-year-old Courtney Stingley, who began working at Walmart nine years ago as an electronics sales associate at the store in his hometown, Forest, Miss. He took on other department roles and got a taste for managing others as an overnight supervisor in another store. But his applications for a manager role that came with a salary, not hourly wages, went nowhere. \"My education was holding me back,\" says Mr. Stingley, who had a two-year associate degree in drafting and design technology.</p><p>Enrolling in the Live Better U program in 2018 and taking the online courses in his off hours, he graduated last October with a bachelor's degree in supply chain, transportation and logistics management. One week after applying for a logistics load manager job at Walmart's Bentonville headquarters, he got the job, and his salary is now double the wages he made before, he says.</p><p>After knowing nearly every role and function in the stores, managing logistics at a regional level has been a culture shock, he says. \"There, I was the go-to for everything; here, I'm starting all over again, but it has been very educational for me,\" says Mr. Stingley, who says he wants to eventually go into human resources. \"It has opened my eyes to the reasons I'm actually here.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Fuhrmans, deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal's management bureau, can be reached at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com.
