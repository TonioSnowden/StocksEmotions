  "title": "Tech exodus is Valley trickle",
  "text": "<p>A noticeable tech exodus from Silicon Valley has been happening in the past year, as the pandemic and the switch to remote working persuaded some it was time to escape the high price of Bay Area living.</p> <p>There were plenty of US cities offering incentives to make a move and Austin and Miami were popular with many executives and companies as they announced their new bases. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4076cf91-ad82-4143-b21b-ea1f9e75c19c\">As Rana Foroohar wrote last month</a>, Miami's mayor Francis Suarez made it enticing with&#xa0;tax credits,&#xa0;low interest rate loans and other economic benefits.</p> <p><a href=\"https://telstraventures.com/techs-great-migration/\">But a report out today</a> suggests it will take a lot more to shift Silicon Valley's position as the centre of tech. <em>Tech's Great Migration</em>, a survey by Telstra Ventures of 35,000 VC-funded US companies, reveals the migration, thus far, has not been that great.</p> <p>Nearly 97 per cent of start-ups stayed in the Bay Area during 2020, with 1.2 per cent relocating. Of those, 21 per cent moved elsewhere in California, 21 per cent went to New York, 12 per cent to Texas, 6 per cent to Colorado, 4 per cent to Massachusetts and 4 per cent to Washington state.</p> <p>“Places like Silicon Valley exist because tech companies and VC firms can take advantage of the talent pool, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the culture of innovation that the emerging hubs can't replicate&#xa0;today,” said Mark Sherman, General Partner at Telstra Ventures.&#xa0;</p> <p>While other cities may not be attracting Valley companies in large numbers, they are still pulling in plenty of VC money as investors diversify. There was only 4 per cent growth in VC investments in the Bay Area last year, but Dallas saw 66 per cent growth, followed by 58 per cent for Portland, Oregon and 51 per cent for Atlanta, Georgia. Denver, Colorado saw the largest growth in the number of start-ups, at 21 per cent.</p> <p>So while workers are more mobile and there is a welcome boost from tech for many states, Silicon Valley has no reason to panic. “We believe the Bay Area will continue to be the&#xa0;epicentre&#xa0;of tech for years to come,” said&#xa0;Mr Sherman.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. UK and EU take on Apple over App Store</strong><br>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e3063a2-c405-4a2e-ab82-d6ccbd6f9198\">opened a probe</a> into Apple over claims it imposes unfair terms and conditions on app developers and abuses its position as a gatekeeper for mobile services on the iPhone.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d37c476c-b4cd-4b47-9ed2-d19ad2341ea8\">Javier Espinoza in Brussels says</a> the EU is set to bring antitrust charges against Apple for the first time, putting more pressure on the iPhone maker to change the way it runs its App Store.</p> <p><strong>2. EU struggles with vaccine passports</strong><br>EU ambassadors discussed proposals for a “Digital Green Pass” on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aeb5f939-7dad-4092-9f51-6c48967c7aa0\">reports Brussels Briefing</a>, with several sceptical about its viability. One of the leading developers of digital Covid-pass solutions for governments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d6479f3-62e8-4232-91a8-c05ed4acbe90\">tells us</a> a vaccine and testing certification scheme should only be a short-term fix which “dies” as we ease out of the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>3. Deliveroo delivers London listing</strong><br>The food delivery group is targeting a price tag of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8108b89-419f-40e8-97c9-ce2c15b905e9\">as much as $10bn</a> in its initial public offering, giving London its most valuable new listing for several years. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dcf0a69-5331-4eaf-87e9-ccee2e4c9463\">Lombard warns</a> those rushing to celebrate its IPO arrival as a victory for new regulatory liberalism might soon wish they had waited to see exactly what's inside the box. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7241895a-c871-46f6-8200-b62182eced3a\">Amazon has opened</a> a grocery store in west London, its first outside North America where subscribers can just place items in a bag and leave without a checkout.</p> <p><strong>4. Square pegs Tidal in round hole</strong><br>Mobile payments company Square has<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b720ff5a-f0f6-4417-b479-814c1e4f6bd5\"> agreed to acquire</a> a majority stake in Tidal, the struggling streaming platform owned by the musician and entrepreneur Jay-Z, for $297m. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c410220e-7131-4b0c-b959-50c7c75a93d0\">Lex wonders</a> what Square chief Jack Dorsey means when he says: “New ideas are found at intersections, and we believe there's a compelling one between music and the economy.”</p> <p><strong>5. Google's post-cookie dough recipe</strong><br>Google gave a <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/\">progress report this week </a>on its plans to get rid of tracking cookies to improve privacy, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6656d8f3-dc40-42eb-a107-956a4b841e42\">Richard Waters comments</a> things will still look the same for web users, and the strengthening of the search giant's own data fortress may alarm rivals, advertisers and regulators.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;— the European start-up week</h2> <p>Virtual events platform Hopin has become one of the fastest-growing European tech companies of all time, announcing on Thursday that it had raised another&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/hopin-raises-400m-5bn-valuation/\">$400m at a $5.65bn valuation</a>. The large price tag makes the company — which launched less than a year ago — more valuable than investor darlings such as the German digital bank N26 and the payments company&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/transferwise-becomes-wise/\">Wise</a>&#xa0;(formally known as TransferWise). The huge investor interest in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/hopin-raises-400m-5bn-valuation/\">Hopin</a>&#xa0;epitomises two megatrends happening at the moment. One is the loose monetary policy by central banks pushing up asset prices in general. The other is how the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the digitisation of the global economy — in this case with events moving online. Hopin has already worked with 85,000 customers including American Express, the Financial Times and Hewlett Packard.</p> <p>Elsewhere in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/european-startups-top-rankings\">European start-ups</a>&#xa0;this week,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/nextmarkets-raises-30m/\">Nextmarkets, a neobroker founded by two brothers from Cologne</a>, has raised $30m to expand its trading platform to more countries around Europe; a German psychedelic start-up&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/atai-series-d-157m/\">Atai raised another $157m</a>&#xa0;and is one of those&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/psychedelics-atai-compass-beckley/\">dominating this growing market</a>; while European Venture capital firms were set to get an extra&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/eif-vc-extra-money/\">€1bn from the European Investment Fund</a>. Sifted&#xa0;also looked at which were the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/spain-startups-top-rankings\">Spanish start-ups to watch</a>&#xa0;this year after a rocky 2020 and how investors were&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/invest-quantum-computing/\">pouring money into European quantum computing</a>.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Edge's vertical tabs</h2> <p>I just counted, and right now I have 47 tabs representing web pages along the top of my main browser window — and I also have several other windows, which can make things very hard to read and find. So, it's good to see Microsoft continuing to innovate with its Edge browser.</p> <p>It had already introduced “sleeping” tabs, which grey out if you're not using them and restore some of your memory while extending battery life. Today <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/03/04/amp-up-your-performance-with-startup-boost-and-find-information-blazingly-fast-with-microsoft-edge-and-bing/\">it announced “vertical tabs”</a>, where you can choose to see your tabs in a more readable sidebar rather than along the top. There are also improvements to Bing search and Startup Boost that should improve start-up times for the browser by between 29 and 41 per cent.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Tech exodus is Valley trickle' FT.com 4 March.
