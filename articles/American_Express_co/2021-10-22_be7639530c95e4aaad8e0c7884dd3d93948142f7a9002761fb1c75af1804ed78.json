The company acquired 2.6 million new proprietary cards in the quarter and saw “all-time highs” in acquisitions of U.S. consumer and small-business Platinum and Gold cards.</p><p>“We're operating from a position of strength, and we see more opportunity ahead to drive sustainable,&#xa0;long-term growth,” Squeri said. Amex is “confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of the EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022.”</p><p>The company's consolidated provisions for credit losses amounted to a $191 million benefit in the third quarter, whereas the company saw a provision expense of $665 million in the year-earlier period. Amex noted that the change largely reflected $393 million in credit reserve releases as well as lower net write-offs during the most recent period.</p><p>Shares of American Express have added 3.8% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has risen 2.2%.</p>",
