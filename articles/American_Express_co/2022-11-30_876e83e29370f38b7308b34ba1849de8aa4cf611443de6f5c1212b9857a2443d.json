  "title": "Delta's Airport Lounges Are About to Get a Little More Exclusive; The airline is increasing requirements and fees for access to its Sky Club, in an effort to address customer complaints about overcrowding",
  "text": "<p>Starting in 2023, only Delta frequent-flier Medallion members will be eligible to purchase an annual membership to its clubs. Those annual fees will also rise, from $545 to $695 for individual memberships and from $845 to $1,495 for executive memberships, Delta said.</p><p>Sky Club members who are flying with Basic Economy fare tickets won't be able to access the lounges on those trips as of Feb. 2, 2023, except if they qualify for the club with an American Express card. Certain Medallion members flying internationally in Main Cabin or Delta Comfort+ seats won't get access to lounges, either.</p><p>\"While we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoy the fruits of our teams' hard work, our goal now is to balance the popularity of the Clubs with the premium service and atmosphere for which they were designed—and that our guests deserve,\" Dwight James, senior vice president for customer engagement and loyalty, said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. James wasn't available for further comment Wednesday, a Delta spokesperson said. It wasn't clear how many Sky Club members will be affected by the changes.</p><p>Travelers flying in Delta One seats will have club access. The changes don't affect fliers with eligible American Express cards who can access lounges, though the guest fees for cardholders will rise from $39 to $50 starting Feb. 2.</p><p>Airline lounges have long been viewed as an escape from busy and crowded terminals, offering food, drinks, ample seating and space for working. In recent years, frequent-flier programs and some credit cards have given more travelers access to the lounges. Issues with overcrowding afflicted lounges this year as travel continued to rebound from a slowdown at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Delta is renovating and expanding capacity at clubs in New York, Boston and Florida airports, among others. It is also rolling out a tracker that will allow members to check occupancy levels at Delta Sky Clubs, and created a special entry line for its most frequent fliers and Delta One travelers.</p><p>Earlier this year, the airline limited lounge access to three hours before departure for eligible fliers.</p><p>\"This is going to make more of a difference than anything else they've done,\" said Gary Leff, author of the air-travel website View From the Wing, of the changes unveiled Wednesday.</p><p>Delta's changes also show the importance the airline places on its partnership with American Express, Mr. Leff said. American Express Platinum and Centurion card holders are eligible for Delta Sky Club access, as are those with Delta SkyMiles American Express credit cards.</p><p>The new requirements and increase in membership fees could push some Sky Club members to open a qualifying credit card, Mr. Leff said. Others who have grown used to their Sky Club perks may feel jilted.</p><p>\"Fliers who saw themselves as important customers, who are no longer welcomed into the clubs in the same way, are liable to feel somewhat put off,\" Mr. Leff said. </p><p>The move is an effort to stymie overcrowding, an issue raised often by customers.

The Platinum Medallion member has often taken advantage of his Sky Club access on international flights, but the new changes mean he will no longer be able to do that—unless he flies in more expensive Delta Premium Select or Delta One seats.</p><p>Mr. O'Leary said he is now considering whether to switch loyalties to a different airline, even as he worries other airliners may make similar changes down the road.</p><p>\"It shouldn't come at the expense of their most loyal customers,\" Mr. O'Leary, 40 years old, said. \"We're the ones who are earning our status outright by spending our money with the airline, and they're punishing us for that.\"</p><p>In a statement, a Delta spokesperson said the company must weigh the club's popularity with the experience the airline is hoping to create.</p><p>\"We are not implementing these measures lightly, and it is important that we take these steps to invest in the customers who invest in us,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p>",
