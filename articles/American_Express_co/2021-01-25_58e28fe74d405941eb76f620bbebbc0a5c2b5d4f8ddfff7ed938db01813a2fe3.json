Worries are not confined to Europe: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9726a4a-ccfc-3c0d-a6f1-f3c7c1ca106a#post-59848\">Australia</a>, for example, today suspended quarantine-free travel with New Zealand.</p> <p>“Things are looking bad and these travel restrictions will make things catastrophic for the industry,” said Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American Express Global Business Travel.</p> <p>There are some glimmers of hope — holiday bookings from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf26dc2f-8c76-445d-b220-c766ef6bbec9\">older customers</a> are surging as the introduction of vaccines boosts confidence — but measures such as the UK potentially requiring visitors to pay for their own 10-day quarantine at designated hotels have only heightened industry anxiety. </p> <p>A tightening of restrictions is especially worrying for countries heavily reliant on foreign tourism, such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4a4dec0-57b5-41a4-8a42-f898c4089df3\">Thailand</a>. Visits to Thailand plunged from 40m in 2019 to 6.8m last year and hotels are lobbying for an end to the mandatory 14-day quarantine for foreigners who can prove they have been vaccinated.</p> <p>The pandemic is also creating structural change within the airline industry.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c519ec-fadb-4a70-b076-2026cdb1a10e\">EasyJet</a> chief executive Johan Lundgren told the FT that the pandemic shake-out meant he was targeting the market share of flag carriers rather than rival budget operators. These legacy national airlines are expected to recover more slowly because of their focus on business trips and long-haul travel. </p> <p>One corner of the airline industry that is seen as more capable of surviving the travel downturn is the leasing sector. Seven companies that own planes they lease to airlines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcebf093-c4ae-4140-89e6-7be874e2a3bc\">raised a combined $14.9bn in January</a>, according to data from Dealogic, with several receiving cut-price borrowing costs.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The pandemic-driven market chaos of 2020 resulted in the <strong>hedge fund</strong> industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d106227-d6e7-4ea2-9772-abb0da694e70\">biggest year of gains</a> in a decade, according to new research. Many big names such as Chase Coleman's Tiger Global and Izzy Englander's Millennium Management were able to profit from March's sell-off and the subsequent rally in risky assets.</p> <p>Veteran fund managers are increasingly worried about the possibility of a huge <strong>bubble</strong> as markets profit from monetary and fiscal support, bond yields remain at historic lows and investors sit on piles of excess cash, writes markets editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a790c796-f0c4-4cf9-8c7a-3b52daff89e4\">Katie Martin</a> in the first article in our new <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/runawaymarkets\">Runaway Markets </a>series.</p> <p>Better profits than expected and the rising number of rigs drilling in the US have led oil services groups to believe the worst of the <strong>oil price crisis</strong> is over. Halliburton chief Jeffrey Miller said: “We view 2021 as a bit of a transition year . . . and we view 2022 as when we see the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8203bcd-c5b5-40a7-943c-c230115d6931\">global rebalancing</a> of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multiyear upcycle.” This rosy view is not universal: <strong>shale groups</strong> are worried about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37504f72-53de-470a-ad3d-3d6dacbe3348\">overdrilling</a> as “bad actors” chase “growth for growth's sake”. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p><strong>Merck </strong>has abandoned its plans for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a0a7d49-4557-45bc-afd1-54a2ca7413fe\">Covid-19 vaccine</a> after disappointing trial results and will instead focus on drugs to treat the disease. Fellow US pharma company <strong>Moderna </strong>said it was developing a new jab for the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0c8f72c-e58e-4319-80c4-0db153ad85db\">South African variant</a>” of the virus, which could be ready — if needed — by the autumn. <strong>Panasonic, </strong>meanwhile, has designed a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/399b4a98-cfbd-4553-bcd9-abdcaae227b8\">freezer box</a> that it hopes can help address serious global problems of transporting vaccines at ultra-low temperatures. </p> <p>We got further evidence today of how the pandemic is reshaping the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c81e7266-984f-4c38-8543-83e6449eb79a\">retail industry</a>. Online retailer <strong>Boohoo</strong> bought the brand of ailing UK department store <strong>Debenhams </strong>and rival internet fashion retailer <strong>Asos</strong> is in talks to buy the high-street brands of former retail tycoon Philip Green, including <strong>Topshop</strong>,<strong> Topman</strong> and <strong>Miss Selfridge</strong>. Both deals exclude the physical stores owned by the traditional retailers — 118 in the case of Debenhams and more than 400 owned by Philip Green's Arcadia empire — threatening thousands of jobs.</p> <p><strong>Family businesses</strong> — as so often in times of crisis — are among the winners in the pandemic, writes columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acb9d0c3-bbfc-471d-9d66-9c37d482ab1f\">Pilita Clark</a>. They are often more frugal, more community minded and more innovative than other businesses — admirable qualities in such dark times.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>US president Joe Biden's $1.9tn<strong> coronavirus stimulus plan</strong> still faces opposition from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4807408f-9590-44f6-95c5-2cb7a6edb4d6\">Republicans</a> who say it is too costly. Democrats want to reach an agreement before Donald Trump's new impeachment trial begins the week of February 8. There was, however, some good news on US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9726a4a-ccfc-3c0d-a6f1-f3c7c1ca106a#post-59828\">infections</a>: states yesterday reported an eight-week low in new cases.</p> <p>Critics have again hit out at the perceived slowness of the <strong>EU's vaccination strategy</strong>, hampered by supply issues and slower regulatory approvals. Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold reports on the role of ECB board member <strong>Isabel Schnabel</strong> in building consensus for the bank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c465acf5-52bf-4f47-98c0-bd911e528f94\">stimulus programme</a> and <strong>Germany's</strong> Ifo index provided another reminder of the need for government action: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9726a4a-ccfc-3c0d-a6f1-f3c7c1ca106a#post-59856\">business confidence</a> fell to a seven-year low at the start of this year.</p> <p><strong>Bookmark this</strong>: Our new hourly-updated <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\">vaccine tracker</a> shows doses administered across the world. </p> <p><strong>Oxfam</strong> told attendees at the “digital Davos” summit that the combined wealth accumulated by the world's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9726a4a-ccfc-3c0d-a6f1-f3c7c1ca106a#post-59855\">10 richest men</a> during the pandemic — $540bn — would be enough to vaccinate the world and reverse the rise in poverty it had created. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9726a4a-ccfc-3c0d-a6f1-f3c7c1ca106a#post-59852\">Red Cross</a> reminded delegates of the pandemic's economic impact on fragile regions and groups such as refugees.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Is the <strong>“labour of love”</strong> a con? A new book argues the pandemic “has made the brutality of the workplace more visible”. Forget the idea that we should all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a583d084-4b61-4527-85dd-ef5324ec0158\">love our work</a> — it won't love us back, author Sarah Jaffe tells Work &amp; Careers columnist Emma Jacobs.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/how-to-lead\">How to Lead</a> series features <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e02a2ef3-2582-4985-95b7-439a023a6d68\">Francesco De Meo</a>, the boss of <strong>Helios</strong>, Europe's largest private hospital group, who said Germany's initial pandemic response would have been handled better with fewer, more efficient hospitals and “without spending so much money”.</p> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>As hopes for the imminent return of international travel begin to fade, wine correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/731f1146-3325-4fe2-b1d9-00451462acfc\">Jancis Robinson</a> offers some tips on how to travel vicariously through wine, taking in everything from the rosés of Provence to the Chianti Classico of Tuscany.</p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
