  "text": "<p>A spate of deals in the business travel industry this week has raised the prospect of rapid consolidation across the sector as it attempts to buffer a permanent fall in corporate demand.</p> <p>US online group Expedia has agreed to sell Egencia, its corporate travel division, to American Express Global Business Travel in a deal valuing the business at roughly $5.5bn. Business travel management company TripActions announced its first acquisition on Wednesday with a deal for UK-based specialist Reed &amp; Mackay for more than $250m in cash and shares.</p> <p>Rival Barcelona-based travel manager TravelPerk last week said it had raised $160m in equity and debt to fund new acquisitions, and, in a much smaller deal, Yorkshire-based corporate travel company Good Travel Management said on Thursday that it had acquired Company Travel, a specialist in travel for engineering and construction, for an undisclosed sum.</p> <p>“It's an industry that needed consolidation whether we had a pandemic or not. These organisations needed more scale to get more leverage over supply and get better deals with customers,” said Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein.</p> <p>Expedia said that as part of its deal it would take a 14 per cent stake in the combined business showing its confidence in a “robust return of travel, including in the corporate space”, despite chief executive Peter Kern saying on an earnings call on Thursday that business travel was “more challenged”.</p> <p>Paul Abbott, chief executive of American Express Global Business Travel, described the deal as strategic, but added further consolidation in the industry was “inevitable” following a year of such disruption. </p> <p>Estimates for the severity of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/867a5342-c94c-43f6-9783-a817443c9471\">decline</a> in business travel vary from zero to 30 per cent, but sector specialists have been quick to counter arguments that a familiarity with video conferencing technology prompted by the pandemic will trigger a permanent drop, particularly among white-collar workers.</p> <p>Ariel Cohen, TripActions' chief executive, said the industry is “really seeing the light at the end of the tunnel”, and argued that there would be more demand from business travellers as remote working became more common.</p> <p>Corporate travel bookings have reached 47 per cent of pre-pandemic levels and were improving 10 per cent week-on-week, he said. </p> <p>“Every CFO today cares about returning to travel . . . if you want to close a $1m deal you need to travel, you need to meet face to face,” Cohen said, but added he had yet to meet Reed &amp; Mackay's UK-based chief executive due to travel restrictions.</p> <p>Already airlines such as Lufthansa, which had a heavy reliance on corporate travel before the pandemic, have started to reduce business class cabins and focus their efforts on attracting more high spending leisure customers.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic's chief executive Shai Weiss told the Financial Times he expects the corporate travel market to shrink, and that his airline's premium seats will be filled by leisure travellers who have saved cash during the pandemic. </p> <p>Big banks and corporates have also announced plans to reduce travel budgets in line with aims to cut carbon emissions. Lloyds Banking Group, for example, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b50d7754-b257-4c5b-88b8-886fb19366b3\">pledged</a> to keep its carbon emissions to half of its 2019 levels after a dramatic drop during 2020.</p> <p>“A cut in business travel could have been coming anyway as a result of raising environmental sensitivities so it is difficult to blame the pandemic entirely,” said Beata Sperling-Tyler, a senior analyst at S&amp;P Global.</p> <p>S&amp;P estimates that air travel will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, led by the fall in business trips, and noted that even before the pandemic hit corporate travel had not recovered to the level it had been before the 2008 financial crash.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/249a2ab9-d5ac-409d-8adf-6b03553d342e.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Alice Hancock and Philip Georgiadis 2021 'Consolidation in business travel sector gathers pace' FT.com 7 May.
