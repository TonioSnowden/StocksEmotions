  "text": "<p>San Mateo, Calif.-based Mondee has made several acquisitions in the past few years to expand into other areas such as hotels, cars and cruises, and launch a subscription-based direct-to-consumer segment.</p><p>\"We're investing into this transformation and the right [merger-and-acquisition] strategies to get there,\" founder and Chief Executive Officer Prasad Gundumogula said in an interview.</p><p>The private-flight deals Mondee currently specializes in are typically sold by travel agents and other companies and help airlines completely fill planes.</p><p>The company was founded in 2011 and is positioning itself as a nimble travel marketplace for consumers who want customized experiences through third parties. Mondee also services so-called gig travel agentsâ€”independent workers around the world who help consumers book travel.</p><p>Mondee joins several other travel brands in unveiling SPAC deals during the coronavirus pandemic, as investors position for greater demand and shifting travel behavior in the years ahead.</p><p>American Express Global Business Travel recently announced a $5.3 billion merger with a blank-check company backed by Apollo Global Management Inc. This summer, HotelPlanner and Reservations.com agreed to combine and go public through a SPAC in a roughly $685 million deal.</p><p>As part of its deal, Mondee is raising a $50 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE, featuring funds affiliated with Morgan Stanley Investment Management and other investors.</p><p>That money and the roughly $240 million raised by the travel and hospitality-focused ITHAX SPAC in January could be used to expand the business, though SPAC investors can withdraw money before the deal goes through. Such withdrawals have become more common lately because of low share prices, making it harder to complete deals.</p><p>Mondee expects this year's sales to remain well below 2019's pre-pandemic levels but anticipates rapid growth in the years ahead.</p><p>Also called a blank-check company, a SPAC is a shell firm that raises money from investors and trades publicly with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm and taking it public. After the private company files detailed financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the deal is approved, that firm replaces the SPAC in the stock market.</p><p>SPAC mergers have become ubiquitous as alternatives to traditional initial public offerings, in part because they allow the company going public to make business projections that aren't allowed in IPOs. There are currently about 575 SPACs in the stock market that together have roughly $155 billion and are looking for private firms to take public, according to SPAC Research.</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Travel Technology Firm Mondee Inks $1 Billion SPAC Deal to Go Public</p>",
