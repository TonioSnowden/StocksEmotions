  "text": "<p>Holidaymakers are a loyal bunch. Crowds of luggage-toting Americans have packed airports this summer despite pricier flights and hotels. More than 2mn people have passed through <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput\">US airport screenings</a> every day since early June. On some days, volumes have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, according to the Transport Security Administration.</p> <p>One group reluctant to join in the fun is investors. Stock prices for the four biggest US airlines by revenues — Delta, American Airlines, United and Southwest — have dropped between a fifth and a third since late April despite the travel boom. </p> <p>Some of this bearishness is justified. Staff shortages have forced airlines to cancel thousands of flights. Jet fuel costs have doubled in the past year. A recession could hurt travel demand.</p> <p>Even so, airlines deserve more loyalty. Many have a lucrative side business that provides a steady stream of revenue in their frequent flyer programmes. Airlines successfully used them as collateral to raise millions of dollars during the pandemic. </p> <p>Delta's partnership with American Express — which makes up the bulk of its SkyMiles loyalty programme — should bring in more than $5bn in revenue this year. That's equal to about 11 per cent of Delta's estimated group total. Delta believes income from Amex could top <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/181345880/files/doc_downloads/2022/6.24.22-Delta-Standing-Presentation-vF.pdf\">$7bn by 2024. </a></p> <p>Profits from the card deal — in which Amex buys miles from Delta to give as rewards to its own customers — also make a difference. Past filings reveal that Delta's SkyMiles programme generated <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/27904/000119312520244688/d27099dex991.htm\">$2.5bn in net income</a> in 2019 — more than half of group net income that year. Expect that to climb in the next two years.</p> <p>At United, the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/100517/000110465920073190/tm2022354d3_ex99-1.htm\">$1.57bn in net profit</a> generated by its MileagePlus programme in 2019 was a similar proportion of total net profit. The unit's 34 per cent ebitda margin trumps the airline's 10 per cent total. </p> <p>As companies attempt to get into the consumer credit card business, demand for air miles peddled by airlines should continue to take flight.</p><p>Source:  2022 'US airlines: loyalty schemes are revenue gold' FT.com 20 July.
