  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Friday's Markets:  Dow Industrials Finish at Fresh Record  ---  All three major  indexes posted gains  for the week boosted  by strong earnings  ----  By Will Horner and Gunjan Banerji",
  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a record Friday and notched a third consecutive week of gains. </p><p>   Stocks have risen in recent days after strong earnings results from some of the biggest U.S. corporations. Most S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings have beat analysts' expectations, and corporate profits are expected to jump around 35% in the latest quarter from the prior year, according to Refinitiv data. </p><p>   Financial results from companies such as Tesla and Johnson &amp; Johnson throughout the week showed that corporate executives have been able to insulate themselves from the global supply-chain crisis and deliver strong results. Some companies have been passing down higher prices to customers. </p><p>   Major indexes wavered Friday after steadily rising for much of the week. </p><p>   The blue-chip gauge added 73.94 points, or 0.2%, to 35677.02, its first high since August. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500shed 4.88 points, or 0.1%, to 4544.90, snapping a seven-session winning streak. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 125.50 points, or 0.8%, to 15090.20. </p><p>   All three major indexes notched weekly gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.6% this week, while the Dow added 1.1%. The Nasdaq was up around 1.3%. </p><p>   On Friday, American Express shares rose $9.61, or 5.4%, to $187.08, making it the best-performing stock in the Dow. The credit-card company posted a rise in earnings that beat analysts' forecasts, in part helped by more consumers dining out. </p><p>   \"It's still a solid backdrop for the stock market,\" said Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. </p><p>   Market volatility has edged lower this week while investors have piled into the stock market, sending major indexes to highs. </p><p>   The Cboe Volatility Index closed at 15.01 Thursday, its lowest close since February 2020. Some investors have turned to the options markets in recent sessions to wager on a continued stock rally, betting that the gains will continue through the end of the year. </p><p>   While the broader market has been calmer in recent sessions, there have been big moves in individual stocks and other assets. </p><p>   Investors have piled into bitcoin, sending prices to a high this week after the first bitcoin ETF started trading. Oil prices have kept soaring. Brent crude oil has jumped for nine consecutive weeks -- the longest winning streak since 1999 -- to $85.53 on Friday, near its high of the year. </p><p>   Digital World Acquisition, the blank-check company taking former President Donald Trump's new social network public, more than doubled in a frenetic trading session that was reminiscent of January's meme-stock mania. The shares were halted at least six times in trading Friday and are now up more than 800% this week, a lurch higher that is unusual even for SPACs, which tend to be volatile. Chatter about the shares permeated Reddit and Twitter. </p><p>   Snap shares fell $19.97, or 27%, to $55.14 after the social-media company said changes to Apple's privacy rules would hurt its ad business. </p><p>   Other technology shares also slipped, with Facebook falling more than 5% and Google parent company Alphabet down 3%. </p><p>   \"When you look at the overall index, you would think things are all calm,\" said Brian Bost, co-head of equity derivatives in the Americas at Barclays. \"The reality is there's a lot of volatility.\" </p><p>   And recent earnings showed that some companies are struggling with parts shortages, spurring big moves in individual stocks. </p><p>   Intel shares dropped roughly 12% after the chip maker posted earnings late Thursday. Component shortages are weighing on Intel's computer shipments and China's gaming crackdown is hurting sales of chips used in servers. </p><p>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.654% on Friday, from 1.574% last week. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%, led by its technology sector. </p><p>   Asian stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%. </p><p>   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%. </p><p></p>",
