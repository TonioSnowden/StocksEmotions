  "title": "Education-Technology Startup Multiverse Raises $130 Million; The company co-founded by Tony Blair's son focuses on apprenticeships, which combine paid work with training and can remove financial barriers to job entry",
  "text": "<p>Multiverse offers professional apprenticeships, which combine instruction with paid work. Company officials and other supporters of apprenticeships say such positions are a way of providing well-paying, on-demand jobs. Companies pay for the apprenticeships, which are typically longer than internships or fellowships, and Multiverse charges for training as well as a fee for recruitment.</p><p>\"Education should not just be delivered in an esoteric, classroom-led academic environment,\" said Euan Blair, the co-founder and chief executive of Multiverse, which operates in the U.K. and U.S.</p><p>Like his father, who once said \"education, education, education\" were among the top priorities of his government, the younger Mr. Blair said education is essential but best rooted in applied learning.</p><p>Euan Blair, who has an undergraduate degree in ancient history and a master's degree in international relations, started his career in investment banking. He said he found himself surrounded by a homogenous group, mostly white men from privileged backgrounds who often attended the same universities and high schools.</p><p>\"None of us had any divine right to be there, but we were there as a consequence of a system of hiring people that was rooted in this sort of academic college-focused arena,\" he said.</p><p>Multiverse, which said it has trained more than 5,000 technology, leadership and digital apprentices, seeks to build a new system around \"durable skills\" and focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.</p><p>Apprenticeships are at the center of a government-led effort on both sides of the Atlantic to bolster the economy, enabling employers to find and retrain employees and offering applicants an entry to high-growth and emerging industries.</p><p>Ken Chenault, a founder of OneTen, a coalition of companies that seeks to create one million, well-paying jobs for Black Americans over 10 years, said the overreliance on academic credentials has served as a barrier for many.</p><p>\"We believe very firmly that apprenticeships can truly be a pathway to family-sustaining jobs,\" said the former American Express Co. chief executive and now chairman and managing director at venture-capital firm General Catalyst, a Multiverse backer. Multiverse works with OneTen as a talent developer.</p><p>Mr. Chenault added that apprenticeships not only help employees access well-paying jobs but also assist companies with attracting and retaining workers with needed skills. \"And frankly as investors, it's attractive relative to the growth that can be achieved,\" he said.</p><p>For Steph Preston, who is pursuing through Multiverse a digital marketing apprenticeship at Blue Zoo Productions Ltd. in the U.K., the apprenticeship offered a chance to learn on the job and to work alongside some of the people who worked on the shows they watched and admired growing up. The animation studio this year won two daytime Emmys for \"The Adventures of Paddington.\"</p><p>Mx. Preston recently worked on the social media and newsletter campaign for a young animator competition in the U.K., the YAY UK Competition.</p><p>\"It's just been a really awesome opportunity, to be honest,\" Mx. Preston said. \"And it's kind of solidified that digital marketing and the creative side of things is definitely where I want to be going in the future.\"</p><p>In addition to monthly workshops, the apprenticeship offers one-on-one training with a coach and reserves 20% of the apprenticeship time to professional development outside of the person's day-to-day role, said Mx. Preston.</p><p>Multiverse officials say that apprenticeships, which remove the typical financial strings attached to higher education, make it easier for people of all backgrounds to access highly skilled jobs.</p><p>The pandemic's economic disruption, as well as a world-wide social justice reckoning following Mr. Floyd's murder, has brought to the forefront—and the boardroom—discussions of inequity and social justice.</p><p>\"Every single chief executive in America is now needing to talk about diversity,\" Mr. Blair said. \"It's part of daily conversations. It's being demanded by employers…it is a core part of the discourse.\"</p><p>Women account for more than half of apprentices placed by Multiverse, even in tech roles, Mr. Blair said, adding that about 50% of apprentices placed are people of color. In addition, more than a third of apprentices placed come from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background, according to the company's 2020 data.</p><p>Multiverse plans to use money from the latest investment—led by D1 Capital Partners and Bond—for general operations, including its recent U.S. expansion that added a partnership with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, as well as to add more programs and qualifications.</p><p>Google, already a Multiverse partner in the U.K., earlier had invested in the company through its venture-capital arm GV, which also participated in this round. Other investors include angel investors John W. Thompson, the chairman of Microsoft Corp., and Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of 23andMe Holding Co.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p><p>Education-Technology Startup Multiverse Raises $130 Million</p>",
