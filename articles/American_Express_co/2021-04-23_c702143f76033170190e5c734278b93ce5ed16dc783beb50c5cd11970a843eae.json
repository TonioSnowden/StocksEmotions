  "text": "<p>US consumers are leading the rebound in travel and entertainment spending, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8dd0e496-da1b-4134-9bb9-f4fa389af3ab\">American Express</a>, but weak demand from consumers abroad and from companies could mean overall travel spending will not recover for years.</p> <p>Month-on-month increases in spending on flights and restaurant meals domestically “indicate that the pent-up demand for consumer travel we've been talking about is real”, said chief executive Stephen Squeri, as the company reported its first-quarter earnings.</p> <p>But lingering cross-border travel restrictions and remote working kept overall spending lower among its international consumer and corporate customers who typically spend more on travel. </p> <p>Recovery among those customers is going to be slow, Amex executives told analysts on a conference call. “We've been talking 2023 before it gets back to 2019 levels,” Squeri said.</p> <p>By the end of 2021, the company expects travel and entertainment spending across the group will recover 70 per cent, from pre-pandemic levels, mostly driven by US consumers and small businesses. </p> <p>Non-travel related spending on goods and services has already rebounded, coming in 11 per cent higher in the first quarter than in the same period in 2019. However, travel and entertainment remains 60 per cent lower, so overall <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33695f9-5178-4c2d-9889-5885aeb613b4\">customer spending</a> on American Express credit cards was still 12 per cent less than in the first quarter of 2019.</p> <p>While spending and overall <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5047c1b6-8ce3-4bff-ad38-530a35e7863e\">credit card lending</a> volumes recover, American Express is stepping up efforts to sign up new customers to speed things along. The company spent $1bn on marketing during the quarter, helping it add 2.1m new card customers. </p> <p>An improved economic outlook has prompted many financial services companies to shift from focusing on preventing losses to hunting for growth. Bankers and economists have become increasingly confident about the outlook, given the scale of fiscal and monetary stimulus. </p> <p>Companies have also been able to release large portions of the reserves for potential bad loans they built up in the first half of last year.</p> <p>A $1.05bn reserve release supported profits at Amex in the first quarter even as revenues missed analyst forecasts. Its shares fell 2 per cent in Friday morning trade.</p> <p>Overall, the company reported a first-quarter net income of $2.2bn, or $2.74 a share, compared with $367m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 12 per cent to $9.1bn, compared with consensus analyst estimates of $9.2bn.</p><p>Source: Imani Moise in New York 2021 'American Express says business travel unlikely to fully recover until 2023' FT.com 23 April.
