  "text": "<p>For these measures to become law, lawmakers will have to move beyond their general unease with dominant companies -- particularly in the tech sector -- and navigate constituencies that don't agree on whether antitrust law needs a major overhaul or targeted changes.</p><p>On Thursday, a Senate subcommittee led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) launched its first in a series of hearings on antitrust changes. She opened the session by urging the panel's members to respond to tech giants not by \"throwing popcorn at a screen at whatever CEO . . . but by actually responding with action, by responding with legislation.\"</p><p>Ms. Klobuchar has offered a package of proposals, including new civil fines for antitrust offenses and changes to legal standards to make it easier to challenge proposed mergers and business practices that threaten competition.</p><p>Republicans signaled they may be open to proposals that Democrats have supported. Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) wondered aloud if Congress should consider limiting mergers by dominant companies or banning self-preferencing, a practice where companies such as Amazon.com Inc. use proprietary platforms to promote their own products and services over those offered by competitors.</p><p>Congress could adopt a policy that \"you can be a neutral platform where you sell third-party goods like Amazon or you can be in the business of selling those goods yourself, but you can't do all of it, all at one time,\" Mr. Hawley said.</p><p>Amazon has said it offers consumers the best product regardless of who made it.</p><p>A House antitrust panel led by Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) will conduct a hearing Friday on a bipartisan proposal to allow local news outlets to join to negotiate with dominant platforms such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>Both parties have been galvanized by concerns about powerful tech firms including Google, Amazon and Facebook. Debate over those firms' power in the U.S. economy -- and over swaths of American society -- has elevated antitrust to a trendy Washington issue.</p><p>For Democrats, tech worries are at the forefront of broader concerns about dominant firms across industries gripping the marketplace and tilting the scales against consumers.</p><p>\"It's not just tech, it's cat food to caskets,\"Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview before the hearing.</p><p>Republicans agree that dominant tech companies possess a worrisome amount of power, motivated at least in part by a belief that they treat conservatives unfairly. They also see increased antitrust enforcement as a better approach than direct government regulation.</p><p>\"There appears to be a broad consensus that the status quo isn't working,\" Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), the leading Republican on the Senate antitrust panel, said recently, though he warned against what he called a desire by some Democrats to \"seize this moment to radically alter our antitrust enforcement regime.\"</p><p>Big businesses are poised to fight many of the measures, which they see as threats to their bottom lines. The tech giants say they face vigorous competition that forces them to constantly innovate, and that they have acquired large market shares because consumers love their products.</p><p>On the Democratic side, the party's more liberal members favor sweeping changes.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline has said he is considering legislation that would force technology companies to break apart widely used digital platforms from other business lines. He has called the idea \"Glass-Steagall for the internet.\" Republicans say that would be a nonstarter.</p><p>Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), the top GOP member of the House antitrust subcommittee, has argued to GOP colleagues that what they consider to be anticonservative bias can be addressed through changes in antitrust law that diminish tech platforms' power and allow for more competition.</p><p>Mr. Buck recommends a \"scalpel-like approach\" focused on the tech sector, and said he is open to requiring dominant tech companies to prove that their proposed acquisitions won't hurt competition. \"I see the need in Big Tech because of the abuse,\" he said in an interview. \"I haven't seen that in other areas.\"</p><p>Mr. Buck, referencing Amazon, Apple and Google, said he is open to prohibiting discriminatory conduct or self-preferencing when a tech platform has monopoly power, including by requiring a monopolist to separate business lines so that it \"can't create its own product and compete against other products in the marketplace.\"</p>",
