  "text": "<p>   Wordle was the most-searched term around the globe in 2022, edging out terms such as World Cup, iPhone 14 and Jeffrey Dahmer. </p><p>   Wordle, a once-a-day online word game, exploded in popularity at the start of the year and peaked in search results in February, according to figures compiled by Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. Wordle, which was acquired by the New York Times in January, was the top-searched term both in the U.S. and globally. </p><p>   These search numbers offer a glimpse into what people were focused on throughout 2022, as the world entered the third year of a global pandemic, supply-chain shortages frustrated businesses and consumers and a major international conflict broke out. </p><p>   \"India vs England,\" a reference to cricket matches between the two nations, was the second-most searched term around the globe in 2022. </p><p>   Searches for Ukraine came in third, followed by Queen Elizabeth II. </p><p>   The top searches for public figures in 2022 were Johnny Depp, Will Smith, Amber Heard, Vladimir Putin and Chris Rock. </p><p>   Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard are in a yearslong legal battle centered on accusations of domestic violence and defamation. </p><p>   A Virginia jury in June found in favor of Mr. Depp for three claims of defamation while also finding in favor of Ms. Heard for one count of defamation.
