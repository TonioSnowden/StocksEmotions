  "text": "<p>If you went…</p><p>…from actor to TikTok star:</p><p>Broadway may be back, but TikTok never even left. And while you were waiting for the theaters to reopen, you amassed a respectable online following, doing the kind of quick, one-off scenes that would've earned polite applause onstage but absolutely kill on social media. Turn in your Equity card and embrace the future of acting: absurdist impressions of Robert Downey Jr. ordering a mocha.</p><p>…from software engineer to tie-dye artist:</p><p>You've been praised since grade school for your ability to turn raw code into magic. But you crave the tactile thrill of working with your hands, the catharsis of unwrapping a sick dye—the joy it brings you to see one of your designs draped over sunburned shoulders at Burning Man.</p><p>…from magazine editor to podcaster:</p><p>Print is dead, friend. Haven't you heard? Time to finally get comfortable with the sound of your recorded voice. Pick an unsolved murder—any unsolved murder. Then line a hallway closet with blankets. A lot of them.</p><p>…from day trader to NFT trader:</p><p>Ditch the Bloomberg terminal. Delete your stock-tracking apps. There's a wild, crazy world out there, and it looks like…well, it looks like a cartoon ape in a multicolor propeller hat that trades for the price of a minor work by a blue-chip artist. NFLX, meet NFT! AAPL, meet ape!</p><p>…from accountant to Formula 1 driver:</p><p>You've heard all the jokes. You've even made some of them. And what hurts the most is you know it's all true. Accountants are boring. But not you. You're the guy who goes home and binges Drive to Survive on Netflix. You're the guy who nearly bent his M3 around a fence post maxing out sixth gear on that county road the cops never watch. Screw QuickBooks! You're taking your passion to the track.</p><p>…from creative director to craft distiller:</p><p>Everyone at the office—remember offices?—knew yours was the desk to congregate around on Friday afternoon. That wide selection of bourbons and ryes, the thrifted midcentury glassware, the little vial of bitters you mixed yourself. But that was child's play. With a decent lawyer and a lease on a well-ventilated space with a working sprinkler system and access to a loading dock, you could be months away from a distiller's license! The next tagline you come up with will be for your very own bourbon.</p><p>…from lawyer to musician:</p><p>No more writing briefs. Now only writing brief guitar solos—for Jeff, your old friend from law school who it turns out has also hit a career rut, and who, by luck or providence, happens to live just down the Connecticut coast from you, and who also thinks Pavement left a lot on the table when they stopped releasing albums.</p><p>…from Mark Zuckerberg to \"Mark Zuckerberg\" character in the Metaverse:</p><p>What you really want this holiday season is to transcend the earthly constraints of your wilting meat suit and become a perfect 3-D rendering of the man who once ruled Facebook. You've done enough. Quit your day job and retire, Mark. But retiring to Florida is out—you're retiring to a virtual landscape built by the same people who designed Epcot. Have fun! Wear sunscreen.</p><p>…from gallerist to artist:</p><p>You never liked going to Chelsea anyway. Good news: Now Chelsea—the concept—exists primarily in the digital realm. Platforms like Artsy and Uprise Art have, if not democratized the space, at least torn down some of its exterior walls, creating new entry points for emerging artists. Which is all the motivation you need. Yes, you can paint better than several of the abstract expressionists! Now show the world.</p><p>…from adjunct professor to cannabis farmer:</p><p>Time to turn in your textbooks and meet your students in a different arena: the one where they pay you handsomely for some dank nug. Once federal legalization hits (only a matter of time!), the early adopters will see tremendous upside. Also, you're not getting tenure, and you know it.</p><p>…from venture capitalist to chef:</p><p>Too many dinners at French Laundry celebrating a portfolio company's IPO has you questioning what's really important in life. Which is not pitch decks and LP memos. It's—what is this? A sous-vide carrot sprinkled with dehydrated coconut milk?! Whatever it is, it's a revelation. Before you march into the kitchen and beg to stage, practice your skills with stuff you didn't get at Ikea.</p><p>…from chef to venture capitalist:</p><p>You sacrificed your Saturday nights to the sauté line for too long. It's time for a day job. Luckily, there are huge perks awaiting in the VC world, and with last year's amendments to the SEC regulations defining accredited investors, it's never been easier to take part in a private offering. First things first: Know the competitive landscape.</p><p>…from real-estate developer to glassblower:</p><p>All the windows of your waterfront high-rise, and the piece of glass you can't take your mind off is the little misshapen tumbler you blew at a weekend workshop in Vermont. You were pretty good for your first time—everyone said so!—and the truth is you've never felt as natural at something. You've made your mark on enough Opportunity Zones.</p><p>Holiday Gifts for Great Resigners: What to Get All the Quitters in Your Life</p>",
