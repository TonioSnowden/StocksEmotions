  "text": "<p><em>How well did you keep up with the news this week? Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-10-29/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em><br><br>Apple and Amazon cited shortages for their disappointing earnings updates yesterday as yet more evidence that businesses are failing to respond to the consumer recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Sky-high energy prices, blockages at ports and labour shortages have all emerged as symptoms of a global economy coming back to life following the rapid shutdown last year.</p> <p>Apple blamed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46069192-7261-4959-b46d-2e30092bce8d\">a global shortage of chips</a> for its earnings miss while Amazon said it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ff4f9f3-7e55-4ac4-a000-c04294a0c338\">struggled to find enough people</a> to work in its warehouses to fulfil customer orders during the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook said “larger than expected supply constraints” had curbed the sales of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers and cost the company $6bn in the third quarter. </p> <p>Brian Olsavsky, chief financial officer of Amazon, said the intense competition for staff had cost the ecommerce giant an additional $1bn in operating costs in the third quarter. </p> <p>Both companies were equally gloomy ahead of the crucial holiday season. Olsavsky&#xa0;said extra operating costs would rise to $4bn in the current quarter, covering Thanksgiving and Christmas. Cook said supply constraints would cost Apple more in this quarter that the last one.</p> <p>“We wish we had more supply (from) where we stand right now,” Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, told the Financial Times, adding that “demand is very, very strong”.</p> <p>Investors took note of the downbeat comments and sent shares in both of the tech giants down sharply in trading after the market closed, indicating the shares of Apple and Amazon will open lower when trading begins later today.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.

Biden unveils deal framework </strong>Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b45d894e-d07c-41c6-b118-c4f5508caba6\">failed to reach agreement</a> with his party on a $1.75tn package of measures to boost investment in climate action, education and healthcare before flying to Europe to attend the G20 summit and UN climate conference. Talks are expected to continue with progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic party today and over the weekend before the bill is put to a vote in Congress. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Cori Bush, the progressive lawmaker from Missouri, urged the White House to keep fighting for a larger domestic spending package in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48f81c2b-f7ae-4081-8bee-676823983f9c\">interview with the Financial Times</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.

As tech titans invest in the quest to extend our lives, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/60d9271c-ae0a-4d44-8b11-956cd2e484a9\">Anjana Ahuja asks</a> if longer lifespans are at last possible — and at what cost. </p> <p><strong>The coming army of Wall St whistleblowers </strong>US banks should be braced for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4313f296-f693-4969-9605-1102cc6d8efd\">wave of whistleblower complaints</a> after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission offered a record&#xa0;$200m award to a former Deutsche Bank employee, offering a reminder that regulators can pay to expose corporate wrongdoing.</p> <p><strong>Are retail trading apps too easy to use? </strong>Confetti and colourful emojis may once have been strangers to the dry, colourless world of digital stock trading but now they are symbols of a debate within brokerages wrestling with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f95ceb63-c5f7-4687-9c21-c664e66cc200\">just how simple apps should be</a>.</p> <p><strong>Lessons for China from Japan's 1990s collapse </strong>One of Chinese policymakers' main goals is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af51a737-954c-475b-8c91-76cafe88ef12\">avoid Japan's 1990s fate</a>, when the excesses from years of rapid growth culminated in the collapse of a spectacular asset price bubble. The longer Beijing takes to address its housing market bubble and accept a lower level of growth, the worse the pain will be.</p> <p><strong>Save more by working less</strong> Simon Kuper explains why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/020b97a5-b34f-4ab7-b011-eda9c36e4f9d\">a four-day work week</a> would be an effective weapon in the fight against climate change. “Instead of more stuff, governments need to offer people more time,” he says, especially in developed countries.</p> <h1>Cinema</h1> <p>Annie Clark, the rock star who performs as St Vincent, and longtime artist friend Carrie Brownstein have combined to explore life and fiction in <em>The Nowhere Inn. </em>“The weirdest, wittiest, most excruciatingly embarrassing tour movie I've ever seen,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6b5d818-a097-42a0-9ccd-c55788ffc618\">says reviewer Helen Brown</a>. </p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Emily Goldberg  2021 'FirstFT: Supply shortages dent tech earnings' FT.com 29 October.
