  "text": "<p>\"My plan attacks inflation and grows the economy by lowering costs for working families, giving workers well-deserved raises, reducing the deficit by historic levels, and making big corporations and the very wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.\"</p><p>\"The other path is the ultra-MAGA plan put forward by congressional Republicans to raise taxes on working families, lower the income of American workers, threaten the sacred programs Americans count on like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and give break after break to big corporations and billionaires just like they did the last time they were in power,\" Biden added.</p><p>MAGA refers to former President Donald Trump's slogan, Make America Great Again. The plan mentioned comes from GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who chairs the National Republican Senate Committee.</p><p>Biden has been highlighting his efforts to address inflation repeatedly, while analysts predict defeats for his Democratic Party in November's midterm elections if high prices persist.

He said Democrats \"control all three branches of government,\" but \"don't really,\" given the Senate's 50-50 split and the need for \"60 votes to get major things done.\"</p><p>The Biden administration has eased some Trump-era tariffs on other countries' goods, but analysts have said more could be done and eliminating the levies would help with inflation.

We're looking at what would have the most positive impact,\" the president told reporters.</p><p>U.S. stocks COMP traded mostly lower Tuesday, continuing their recent selloff.
