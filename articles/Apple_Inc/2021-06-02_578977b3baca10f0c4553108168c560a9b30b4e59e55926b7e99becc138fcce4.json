But the slowdown in launches, with just 30 US Spac initial public offerings completed in April and May compared to 299 in first three months of the year, has restricted the flow of cash.&#xa0;</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8\">team DD told you a while back</a>, investor enthusiasm has waned over the past few months amid disappointing share price performance from recent deals. (If you want to keep track yourself, you can follow the FT Alphaville x Due Diligence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b835f6f0-4624-4f46-90ef-94a4c5b4616b\">Spac Master spreadsheet</a>.)&#xa0;</p> <p>These aren't the only Spac setbacks as of late. Increased regulatory scrutiny<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\"> has put the Spac market on edge</a> as officials question key features, including accounting standards for warrants and forecasts for future earnings.</p> <p>Plus, the share price “pop” enjoyed by Spacs after they have announced a merger has somewhat <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c22bcb2-6184-4c3b-9284-bb152a578629\">vanished of late</a>, and the trend is starting to cross over<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffe2e371-cc9e-41cc-94d4-b6d3446b6ed7\"> into traditional IPOs</a> as well.</p> <p>The FT's Aziza Kasumov and Eric Platt reported that the IPO market has cooled significantly since the first quarter.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shares of companies joining the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq rose on average more than 40 per cent from their IPO price on the first day of trading in January and February. The average pop dropped to 20 per cent in March and April and even further in May to 18 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bankers, ever the optimists, are hoping for a rebound.</p> <h2>AMC's meme stock sequel&#xa0;</h2> <p>Distressed debt investing is dead for now. The latest evidence: hedge fund manager <strong>Jason Mudrick</strong>‘s foray into growth capital in the entertainment business.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Tuesday, <strong>AMC Entertainment </strong>announced that <strong>Mudrick Capital</strong>, best known as an investor in wayward companies, had bought $230m in fresh equity at roughly $27 per share. That price was roughly triple where the company had traded a month ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>No sooner than the ink was dry on the securities filings, Mudrick had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c561ec52-25b4-4700-8d3f-56c002a46a86\">sold his shares</a> during the course trading on Tuesday after AMC's stock price soared into the low $30s. Mudrick's exact gain hasn't been disclosed, but unhedged, it's likely in the $30m to $50m range.</p> <p>It's a great deal for AMC, too, Alphaville's Jamie Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e15c0ee-3b89-4e93-8f00-bc716a9a0479\">points out</a>: Back in January, raising the cash would have meant selling 35 per cent of the company, draining its shareholders in the process. Now investors are set to lose just 1.3 per cent of their claims to future profits.</p> <p>The event signals <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/482ca65b-9eb3-40dc-97fe-b9a4383b8396\">another whirlwind ride</a> for the cinema chain on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11e59520-a504-4098-9fc1-e2fe66887e14\">meme stock rollercoaster</a>. Over the winter, Mudrick and <strong>Silver Lake Partners </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc349acb-e009-4bb1-8a03-6e3a039ed505\">profited</a> from the original trading mayhem at AMC, though then the company's shares were roughly around $20.&#xa0;</p> <p>AMC said it would use Mudrick's money to consolidate less resilient movie theatre chains.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the cash firmly in hand, what Mudrick does probably doesn't bother them too much.&#xa0;</p> <p>As for Mudrick, he can now return to hunting for diamonds in the financial rough.</p> <p>But with firms like his pouring money into distressed cinemas to keep them afloat at towering valuations, he shouldn't expect to find a bargain anytime soon.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Wirecard continues to haunt former auditor EY</h2> <p>It's the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\">scandal</a> that just keeps on giving.</p> <p>Partners at <strong>EY France </strong>are going “ballistic” over fears that a drive to centralise the Big Four accountant's operations could force them to share in any financial hit from the firm's audits of the fallen German payments group <strong>Wirecard</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63336afd-7b1e-4142-8ee0-48bc678d2a1e\">sources tell</a> the FT's Michael O'Dwyer and Olaf Storbeck.</p> <p>EY hopes to halve regional management costs by replacing three subregions with a new “Europe West” zone covering 25 countries in Europe and north Africa. Regional management will have final say on the pay of 1,500 partners, shifting power away from the national member firms that make up EY's global network.&#xa0;</p> <p>The accountancy also wants to increase pooling of staff and investments in technology. Business lines such as M&amp;A advisory and consulting will be run under a single income statement across the region, insiders told the FT.</p> <p>It's particularly important to eliminate “silo behaviour”, as it's known in the consulting business, where turf wars between national partnerships can make it harder to offer clients a joined-up international service, industry executives said. Regulations make cross-border integration of audit and tax divisions trickier to pull off.</p> <p>Financial and operational integration of national partnerships is “the holy grail” for Big Four firms, according to a former senior executive at one of EY's rivals. “If they're able to deliver it then it's better for clients and it's a competitive advantage.”</p> <p>Concerns among partners in France and other countries that the shake-up will force them to share financial pain from Wirecard-related regulatory penalties and litigation are “unfounded”, said a person involved in the restructuring.</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong>don't miss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/309873bc-aea0-416c-8708-f825086f0932\">this deeply-reported profile</a> by the FT's Stefania Palma, Olaf Storbeck and John Reed on <strong>Mark Tolentino</strong>, the Manila-based lawyer and all-around fascinating character embroiled in the Wirecard saga.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>William Hill </strong>has appointed<strong> Eric Hageman</strong>, former <strong>IWG </strong>finance chief, as its new chief financial officer following the UK bookmaker's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d70927-5822-4390-a2a1-ce445a43f0b4\">acquisition</a> by <strong>Caesars Entertainment</strong>.
