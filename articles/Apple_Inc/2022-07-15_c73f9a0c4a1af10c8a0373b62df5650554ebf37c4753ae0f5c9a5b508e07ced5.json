  "title": "Technology:  TSMC Increases  Forecast as Chip  Demand Endures  ----  By Yang Jie",
  "text": "<p>   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing strong demand for chips used in products including high-performance computers -- and going against the industrial tide of a slowing chip boom. </p><p>   The world's largest contract chip maker expects its U.S.-dollar-based revenue this year to grow by about 35% from a year earlier, compared with an earlier estimate of around 30%. It also forecasts July-September revenue at between $19.8 billion and $20.6 billion, up at least 33% from a year earlier, TSMC said Thursday. </p><p>   \"Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continues to exceed our ability to supply,\" said C.C. Wei, TSMC's chief executive, referring to the recent order cuts flagged by some chip makers. TSMC's production capacity will remain tight throughout this year, Mr. Wei said in a quarterly earnings call. </p><p>   TSMC's confidence highlights the strengths of its business, even as elsewhere in the semiconductor industry signs of weakness emerge following a boom during the pandemic. </p><p>   Chip maker Micron Technology Inc. has recently issued a subdued revenue outlook for the current quarter, spooking some investors. The average contract price for a major type of memory chip has dropped for the first time in two years during the April-to-June quarter versus the prior year. </p><p>   Signs of the industry's slowdown follow a period of soaring demand for semiconductors during the pandemic, which created extra demand for personal computers, gadgets and data servers that help power online activity. Recently, PC sales have slumped and cryptocurrency markets have crashed. </p><p>   But TSMC is still facing robust demand and sticking with its plan to invest about $40 billion this year to beef up chip production, said Chairman Mark Liu. </p><p>   For the April-to-June quarter, its net profit surged by 76% to a record 237 billion New Taiwan dollars, equivalent to $7.95 billion. </p><p>   Quarterly revenue from the high-performance computing sector, which processes data at high speeds, increased 13% from the previous quarter and was greater than the revenue from smartphones, which rose 3%. The two sectors accounted for more than half of TSMC's second quarter revenue. </p><p>   TSMC counts iPhone maker Apple Inc. and graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp. among its customers. In the high-performance computing sector, TSMC-made chips are used in central-processing and graphics units, as well as in autonomous driving vehicles. Company executives said this sector is going to be its main driver of growth in the next couple of years. </p><p>   TSMC faces competition from its rival Samsung Electronics Co. in making the world's most advanced chips. Samsung announced initial production of its most advanced 3-nanometer chips last month, which came ahead of TSMC's slated mass production of a similar-level technology product later this year. </p><p>   Meanwhile, TSMC plans to continue investing in less-advanced chips, such as the ones used in cars, Mr. Wei said. The less advanced chips were traditionally products that TSMC didn't emphasize as much as its cutting-edge chips, but their importance for the industry is growing as demand for such chips expands. </p><p>   North American customers accounted for about 64% of TSMC's second-quarter revenue, while revenue from China was 13% of the total, up from 11% in the previous quarter. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kosaku Narioka contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
