  "text": "<p>An assault rifle is a weapon that, among other things, is capable of fully automatic fire. Examples are the M16, M4 and AK-47. Semiautomatic variants of the M16, referred to generically as AR-15 rifles, aren't technically assault rifles although they are nearly identical in appearance. So unless a gun is truly an assault rifle, an acceptable phrase is assault-style rifle. In fact, we also refer to an AR-15-style rifle, if we aren't sure if it is actually an AR-15.</p><p>As for assault weapons, there is no agreed-upon definition, aside from being semiautomatic firearms that share a number of features with military weapons; more about that term can be found in this Washington Wire​ from 2016​. Our articles should use the term with caution when speaking in our own voice (politicians or others, of course, can be quoted using the term). If the article is about addressing legislation on the books or legislation being considered, we should refer to guns described as assault weapons or to assault-style weapons.</p><p>Commas matter</p><p>We misuse commas in titles and with names, says Editor in Chief Matt Murray. Use commas when the name is an independent clause, but not otherwise. He points out:</p><p>Wrong: Britain's leader Boris Johnson</p><p>Correct: Britain's leader, Boris Johnson,</p><p>or: British leader Boris Johnson</p><p>or: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson</p><p>or: Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson,</p><p>And in a similar vein, a reminder that commas are essential in many phrases referring to people, if someone is the sole person with a certain standing. For example, we write his son, Robert, if Robert is someone's only son, but no commas (his son Robert) if there is more than one. Or her husband, Jim Smith, (because with no commas, it implies there is another husband).</p><p>Still Turkey to Us</p><p>This month, the U.N. honored Turkey's request to be known as Türkiye, which is the country's Turkish spelling. Apparently, the country's leaders have never been thrilled that google searches for Turkey produce images of large birds. The country is increasingly using Türkiye in marketing.</p><p>But we are of the same mind as the Associated Press, whose editors say that they will stick with Turkey for now as the English transliteration, and monitor how much acceptance the Turkish spelling might get before deciding whether to change.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* Juneteenth National Independence Day is the official name of the federal holiday that will be celebrated for the first time this year, on Monday, June 20. It commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. in 1865. U.S. financial markets will be closed for the first time and The Wall Street Journal print edition won't be published.</p><p>* The newly public used-clothes company is ThredUp Inc. When it was a private company, we used its stylized capitalization of thredUP, but the stock's name is officially ThredUp.</p><p>* We spell close-up with a hyphen, not closeup. Close-Up in a headline.</p><p>* Stocks don't always \"tumble.\" They also fall, drop, and other more-sober verbs. Let the facts tell.</p><p>* We spell it Marrakesh rather than Marrakech for the city in Morocco.</p><p>* Investible is the spelling preferred over investable.</p><p>* What is it with \"direction of travel,\" a popular phrase? Simply saying direction would do.</p><p>* Sabew, the journalists society, stands for the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing. It formerly was the Society of American Business Editors and Writers. And we render the acronym as Sabew, rather than all-caps SABEW, under our rule for pronounceable, proper-name abbreviations of more than four letters, when we arbitrarily capitalize only the first letter.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Does Your Mayo Need a Mission?\" by Erik Holm and Lisa Kalis.</p><p>* \"Great Adaptations,\" by Heather Halberstadt, about a house that is built for all four seasons.</p><p>* \"Plot Twist! Movie Theaters Fear Popcorn Shortfall Will Be a Spoiler\" by Steve Yoder.</p><p>Heads that make you go 'hmmm'</p><p>* \"Collaborator Is Facing Home-Town Justice.\" One word on Hometown.</p><p>* \"Bad Inflation Reports Raise Odds of Surprise 0.75-Percentage-Point Rate Rise This Week.\" Since raised odds means something is less likely, make it Increase the Chances. (We have added an item about odds and this common misfire to the WSJ stylebook.)</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* Americans are acting like it's 2019</p><p>* A multiagency dragnet is under way to capture the fugitive behind a spate of bloody attacks. He's three-and-a-half feet tall and known only as Tom.</p><p>* The one city in America with more people back in the office than anywhere else</p><p>* Your birthday says 52 but your body says 37. Meet your \"biological age.\"</p><p>* There are new rules on how to dress for weddings</p><p>* A surgeon lost his life savings. Others have given up on their dreams. All of them were swept up in crypto mania—and the crash.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* First stop: a locally owned auto-repair shop in an up-and-coming part of Philadelphia, where she is to record the total cost for a rear-brake job, wheel-bearing hull assembly replacement and full brake replacement.</p><p>* Resembling a white stick of gum with buttons, he said it's lightweight and there's no screen to break.</p><p>* The Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation and onsite inspection, noting earlier findings that had detected the bacteria at the plant.</p><p>* One Bortac agent took rounds to their shield upon entering and a second was wounded by shrapnel.</p><p>* Analysts say that in both cases, billions of dollars were lost to corruption, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, has since sought to reign in.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* A wheel-bearing hub assembly, that is.</p><p>* To avoid the dangler, perhaps just move the attribution: Resembling a white stick of gum with buttons, it's lightweight, and there's no screen to break, he said.</p><p>* We use a hyphen in on-site (as well as off-site).</p><p>* To his or her shield, that is. Our stylebook says the \"singular they\" (or their) still isn't good grammar except in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns.</p><p>* Royals reign, but they (and everyone) rein in corruption and other things.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.</p><p>ISSN 1054-7041</p><p>Vol. 35, No. 5: Guns</p>",
