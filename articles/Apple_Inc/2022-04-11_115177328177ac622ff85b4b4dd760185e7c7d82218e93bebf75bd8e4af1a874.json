  "text": "<p>   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. -- Democrat Jennifer Loughran spent the pandemic's early days sewing face masks for neighbors. Last month, as a newly elected school-board member, she voted to lift the district's mask mandate. That came four months after she voted for the state's Republican candidate for governor. </p><p>   After a monthslong political identity crisis, Ms. Loughran decided her opposition to her party's mask mandates, economic restrictions and school-closure policies outweighed her support for positions on climate change, abortion and gay rights, at least for the moment. </p><p>   Watching her daughter fall behind in virtual kindergarten, Ms. Loughran had grown so frustrated not knowing when her children would return to the classroom that she joined a group that attracted right-leaning parents in its school-reopening push. She was unhappy that Gov. Phil Murphy didn't fight to reopen schools sooner, and she associated his fellow Democrats with mask mandates and restrictions. </p><p>   She hasn't decided which party to pick this fall in her local House race, a contest expected to help determine control of Congress. \"What I do know,\" she said, \"is that my party-line vote shouldn't be taken for granted anymore.\" </p><p>   The defection of once-loyal voters like Ms. Loughran -- along with disapproval from independents -- is among the challenges Democrats face in their bid to retain control of Congress and win state-level races in this November's midterm elections. These voters say Democratic officials left pandemic restrictions in place too long and mishandled the health crisis, with devastating consequences for their children, while Republicans have generally pushed to minimize school closures and keep the economy open. </p><p>   The party out of power usually wins midterm elections during a president's first term. Public-opinion surveys signal that the trend is holding firm. A Wall Street Journal poll taken in March showed that 46% of U.S. voters plan to back Republican candidates for Congress, while 41% would support Democrats. </p><p>   On the pandemic, the Journal poll showed voters believed Democrats were best able to get the pandemic under control by a 9-percentage-point margin. But that was down from 16 points just four months earlier. </p><p>   Regionally, one of the most significant drops in the party's pandemic-management approval was in the Northeast, where a 30-point edge for Democrats in November had dropped to 20 points last month, the Journal poll showed. The drop was driven mainly by independents, among whom the party's 12-point advantage in the previous poll had evaporated. In the new survey, independent voters were split 29% to 29% over which party was best able to handle Covid-19. </p><p>   Ms. Loughran, a 45-year-old skateboard instructor with red dip-dyed hair and a blue-collar upbringing, had speared an Obama-Biden sign into her suburban home's lawn and waived a handmade placard at the Women's March in New York during President Donald Trump's first year in office. </p><p>   Her party allegiance began to erode during lockdowns as she and her husband, Michael Loughran, juggled her oldest daughter's virtual kindergarten, a toddler tolling countless iPad hours and an infant who was diagnosed with a deadly genetic disorder. Her vote for Jack Ciattarelli as New Jersey's governor was the first time she had backed a Republican in a state or federal contest. </p><p>   The shift in the New Jersey electorate last fall shocked the political establishment and nearly cost the incumbent Mr. Murphy a second term. Advisers to Mr. Murphy said the campaign underestimated Covid frustration inside the Democratic Party. </p><p>   The governor has taken steps to address that. Mr. Murphy, who had supported strict measures to stem Covid's spread, was the first of several Democratic governors to lift statewide mask mandates. </p><p>   Mr. Ciattarelli, on the campaign trail, said the governor should have done more to make the vaccine available to teachers sooner and reopen schools faster. Mr. Ciattarelli, in an interview, said he wouldn't have come so close to winning without support from Democratic and independent voters and sensed some of that backing was rooted in pandemic fatigue. </p><p>   In the Virginia governor's contest, Glenn Youngkin made parental involvement in schools a top issue and became the first Republican to win the seat in 12 years. His first major legislative action as governor was to end the state's mask mandate in schools. </p><p>   Democratic voters broadly support their party's pandemic response. In a March poll from Rutgers University, 52% of voters graded Gov. Murphy's Covid response as an \"A\" or \"B,\" the highest grade for any of the 11 issues tested in the poll. In the Journal's national poll, 49% of voters said they approved of President Biden's handling of the virus, among his highest approval ratings in a list of issues included in the survey. </p><p>   Ms. Loughran's husband, an unaffiliated voter who typically backs Democrats for state and federal office, said he shared his wife's frustrations over the party's Covid response. But he weighted that issue differently in his calculation to back Gov. Murphy for a second term. \"I thought whoever was going to be in office would drop the mask mandates either way,\" he said. \"Some of that kind of stuff was going to take care of itself.\" </p><p>   Interviews with New Jersey voters revealed that some Democrats' breaks from their party last fall were neither flippant nor fleeting. Many described personal struggles to stress what they viewed as the needs of their family or community over partisanship. For some, mandates over vaccines and masks violated personal convictions over choices about their health that sparked fears about other potential invasions of privacy. Others expressed a newfound nuance to their political approach. </p><p>   Democratic voters who have broken from their party over Covid often describe decisions they reached only after wrestling with issues such as their support for abortion rights and opposition to gun control. </p><p>   Among them is Gina Genovese, a longtime Democratic voter until November, when she cast her ballot for Mr. Ciattarelli. She ran for New Jersey governor as an independent in 2017 and was the state's first openly gay mayor in 2006 when she presided over Long Hill, N.J., as a Democrat. </p><p>   She said she was turned off by her party's support for mask and vaccine mandates, which she viewed as violations of personal freedom. Last year, she helped finance a lawsuit that unsuccessfully attempted to strike Gov. Murphy's mask requirement inside schools. \"Democrats have left me so disillusioned,\" she said. </p><p>   Ms. Genovese described herself as \"far-left\" on global warming and gay rights and said it was a tough decision to support Republicans during the pandemic. She said she would probably back the Republican Thomas H. Kean Jr. for Congress this fall. </p><p>   \"I'm a pro-choice person -- my body, my choice,\" she said, applying a phrase from the debate over abortion to the issue of mask and vaccine mandates. </p><p>   Bridgewater, an upper-middle-class suburb in northern New Jersey, last fall backed the GOP's Mr. Ciattarelli by 5 percentage points over Mr. Murphy just one year after it delivered Joe Biden's campaign a 12-point victory. Statewide, Mr. Murphy won by 3 percentage points; Mr. Biden won by 16 points. </p><p>   Bridgewater is in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, represented by Democrat Tom Malinowski, whose likely challenger is Mr. Kean, a former state lawmaker and son of a former New Jersey governor. The state legislature's Democrats redrew the district this year, making several other districts safer for Democratic incumbents while jeopardizing Mr. Malinowski's re-election. The district remains majority Democratic, but by a 3.7-point margin instead of 9.9 points. </p><p>   Mr. Malinowski pushed to reopen schools in early 2021, calling on the Biden administration to ensure teachers were among the first to be vaccinated and urging state officials to do the same. Still, he said, \"There has been a lot of frustration over the impact on families and kids staying home that some Democrats were slow to recognize.\" </p><p>   Mr. Kean said he has seen pandemic frustration manifested in the campaign as inflation has become a concern. \"We lost an entire year of learning,\" he said, \"and New Jersey only got less and less affordable.\" </p><p>   Rachel Keane, a 35-year-old registered nurse and mother of two just outside the district in West Orange, N.J., said she had never voted Republican until last fall, when she opted for Mr. Ciattarelli and every other Republican candidate on her ballot. She had always supported Democrats without a second thought, but her anger over the governor's mask requirements for children made her question that loyalty. \"I knew I wasn't going to vote for Murphy, but wasn't sure if I was going to leave it blank or what,\" she said. \"Then I just got angry. . .And I voted Republican all the way down the line.\" </p><p>   She said Mr. Murphy was too slow to push for a return to the classroom, which raised doubts for her about whether schools would open and stay open. That stress prompted her to keep her 5-year-old in private daycare instead of sending him to kindergarten, which has cost her family about $1,200 a month. She said she remained distressed about her party and wasn't sure how she would vote this fall. </p><p>   Ben Ashfield and Tammy Tiranasar, self-described former liberals who now vote Republican, opened The Village Electric, a co-learning center in Mountainside, N.J., aimed at like-minded families during the pandemic. The center operates as a de facto school for home-school families, and it attracted parents and staff who wanted to be part of an education system that didn't require masks or ask about vaccine status. </p><p></p>",
