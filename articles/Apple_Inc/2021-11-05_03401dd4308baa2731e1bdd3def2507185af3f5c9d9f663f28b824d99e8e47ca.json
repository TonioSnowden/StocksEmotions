  "title": "For Meta, Metaverse Isn't Extra --- Deteriorating engagement with younger users on Facebook and Instagram makes it critical for the company to look to the future",
  "text": "<p>Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms Inc. is going full-speed ahead building a metaverse to move beyond the world's most popular set of social-media platforms. It is a place where Facebook's chief envisions people will work, play, socialize and spend money as avatars. Mr. Zuckerberg likely sees it as a financial imperative.</p><p>Meta is predicted to generate more than $114 billion in advertising revenue this year, but its growth is slowing rapidly. Wall Street forecasts the company's ad business will grow nearly 37% in 2021, but just under 12% by 2024. Meta's reported financials, coupled with internal research reported by The Wall Street Journal in September, show that despite its dominance in social media, the company is losing favor with its most lucrative user base.</p><p>The company provides user numbers by geography only for its legacy Blue app, which it said had 1.93 billion daily active users as of the third quarter. The U.S. and Canada made up 10% of that user base in that period, but those countries generated 46% of Meta's total ad revenue.</p><p>Meta's third-quarter earnings presentation suggests a higher percentage of the U.S. population are using Facebook monthly than are employed in any capacity -- a stat that might lead you to believe that Facebook is a basic necessity in America. Recently, that seems to be changing. As of the third quarter, Facebook's U.S. daily active user base is flat compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Facebook's U.S. saturation rate, according to Meta's internal research, dated March, is strongest among those aged 18 to 29. On Instagram, the saturation rate among U.S. teens is over 100%. That demographic logged declines over the preceding six months in retention, sessions and messaging on Instagram, according to the research. Teens have demonstrated declines in production and consumption, which one leaked document called \"worrying.\"</p><p>And it isn't as though those teens are merely moving from Instagram to the classic Blue Facebook app, either: U.S. teen saturation, defined as those ages 13 to 17, on Facebook is 41%, Meta's internal research shows. In crucial developed markets such as the U.S., migration from Instagram to Facebook is low, leading researchers to warn that \"we may not reach full saturation with current teens.\"</p><p>Lately, it seems as if more of everyone's time is spent elsewhere. According to the internal research, third-party data shows TikTok more than doubled time spent across U.S. users of all ages over the past year, while the same metric on Facebook grew just 6%.</p><p>Competition seems to be hitting Meta from all angles. Just 14% of U.S. teens viewed Facebook's Messenger as their primary messaging app as of the fourth quarter of last year, according to the leaked research. That compares with 24% of U.S. teens using Snapchat most heavily for messaging and 20% of them favoring Apple's iMessage. The same research describes U.S. teens' preferences for Messenger as \"way behind\" these competitors.</p><p>Collectively, these data help frame the vision Mr. Zuckerberg laid out for Meta's future last week as much more than just a founder's fancy. He was clear on the third-quarter earnings call that Reels, Facebook and Instagram's video-based TikTok-like feature, will be a crucial growth priority. He was clear Meta will be retooling all of its apps to optimize for young adults -- a shift that he said would take years and may well come at the expense of other demographics.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg clearly sees virtual and augmented reality as the next, next big things for young people. When the time comes, he wants his company to be there from the start, not racing to catch up like it is now with TikTok.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg called the Metaverse \"the ultimate dream.\" For his company, it is do or dwindle.</p>",
