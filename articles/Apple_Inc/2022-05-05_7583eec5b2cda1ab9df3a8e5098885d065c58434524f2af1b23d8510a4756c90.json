  "title": "Alice's Book by Karina Urbach — the recipes stolen by the Nazis",
  "text": "<p>In the summer of 1949, Alice Urbach, an Austrian Jewish cookery teacher and writer, was walking through the streets of her native Vienna when she spotted a copy of her own cookbook in a book shop. This surprised her in more ways than one. First, because after the turmoil of the war, Alice had no idea that her once-bestselling book was still in print. Second, because the book's cover stated that it was authored not by Alice but by a man called Rudolf Rösch, a non-Jewish name.</p> <p>On its publication in 1935, Alice Urbach's book — <em>So kocht man in Wien!</em> (<em>Cooking the Viennese Way!</em>) — had been a huge critical and commercial success. It was a 500-page encyclopedic collection of Austrian recipes that covered everything from traditional hearty fare such as dumplings and apple strudel to newer trends such as raw food and vegetarian dishes. It drew on Alice's experiences teaching cookery to rich society ladies, a career she had adopted to support herself and her two boys after the premature death of her alcoholic husband Max in 1920. But in 1938, Alice had fled to England, and during the war she ran a home for refugee children.</p> <p>The Vienna that she returned to in 1949 was full of loss. The synagogues that Alice remembered from her youth had been burnt to the ground. Her three sisters had died in the Holocaust. And now she discovered that her cookbook had also been taken from her. “You can imagine that it breaks my heart”, she wrote to Ernst Reinhardt Verlag — the same publishing house that had originally published the book as her work.</p> <p><em>Alice's Book</em>, written by Alice's granddaughter, the historian Karina Urbach, and translated by Jamie Bulloch, is a gripping piece of 20th-century family history but also something much more original: a rare insight into the “Aryanisation” of Jewish-authored books during the Nazi regime. Urbach has meticulously pieced together everything she could find about how and why Alice's publishers were able to deny her authorship for more than 80 years.</p> <p>Much has been written about the Nazi theft of Jewish art collections. Far less is known about the intellectual reappropriation of books written by Jews. <em>Alice's Book</em> — which was first published in Germany in 2020 — offers a startling perspective on what the historian Ralph Giordano called the “second guilt” of postwar Austria and Germany: the way in which respectable businesses and individuals continued to profit from the persecution of Jews long after the Holocaust had ended.</p> <p>Under the Nazis, books that were considered “Un-German” were burnt. But Alice's cookbook was in a different category: a much-loved and useful book whose content was apolitical but whose author was inconveniently Jewish. Her publisher Hermann Jungck (who worked for Ernst Reinhardt Verlag) therefore set about Aryanising it.</p> <p>Defending himself in print in the 1970s, Jungck claimed that the reason he had asked Rudolf Rösch (a shadowy figure whose identity remains unclear) to revise Alice's text was because her “extremely rich dishes” needed to be brought “up to date”. This assertion was false. Alice's original 1935 edition already included numerous light vegetarian dishes and “hints on healthy eating”. The real changes made to her text in 1938 were not to make the dishes lighter but to remove references to Jewish and international cuisine. “Recipes with Jewish names, such as ‘Rothschild sponge', ‘Rothschild omelette' or ‘Jaffa torte' were removed, and foreign names of recipes Germanised.” The book continued to sell thousands of copies in this new form and ran to many editions.</p> <p>For Urbach, Jungck's decision to Aryanise books was an understandable choice for a Viennese publishing house in 1938. His “real culpability”, in Urbach's view, “begins only after 1945”. Alice, who spent the decades after the war eking out a living on a widow's pension in the US, repeatedly begged Jungck and his colleagues to restore her as the rightful author of her own book — to be met with stonewalling and evasion. It was only in 2020, nearly 40 years after her death, that the rights were finally returned to the Urbach family as a result of publicity following the German publication of <em>Alice's Book</em>.</p> <p>Yet, despite the bitter injustice of her authorship being stolen, Alice Urbach seems to have retained her joy in Viennese cookery to the end. It's impossible to read this moving and clear-eyed book without admiring Alice's fiercely optimistic spirit. The book is as much about the enduring consolations of food as it is about Nazi crimes against Jewish authors. Urbach reports that her remarkable grandmother was still giving cookery lessons in San Francisco well into her nineties, when she appeared on PBS as the oldest cookery teacher in America.</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3s9sB9U\"><strong>Alice's Book</strong></a><strong>: How the Nazis Stole My Grandmother's Cookbook</strong> by Karina Urbach, translated by Jamie Bulloch, <em>MacLehose Press £20, 368 pages</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Bee Wilson 2022 'Alice's Book by Karina Urbach — the recipes stolen by the Nazis' FT.com 5 May.
