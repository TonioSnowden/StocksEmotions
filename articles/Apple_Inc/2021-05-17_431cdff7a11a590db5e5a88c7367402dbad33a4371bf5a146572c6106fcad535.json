  "text": "<p>The Amazon-backed smart home company Tado has raised a further $46m from new and existing investors, in what is intended to be its last funding round before a sale or public offering.</p> <p>The German start-up, which says it has installed more than 1m of its smart thermostats to date, competes with the likes of Hive, Honeywell and Google's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c220edb9-02c2-4453-8524-96511b3cacca\">Nest</a> in an increasingly crowded market.</p> <p>Its latest round, led by a new investment from Hamburg-based Noventic Group, brings the total fundraisings to date to $148m, and values the 10-year-old company in the “high three-digit millions”, according to people with knowledge of the matter. </p> <p>The people added that Munich-based Tado would now consider a flotation, possibly in Frankfurt or London, but the business was “not in a hurry”.</p> <p>While US tech groups have cornered the connected devices market in America, Tado has become a leading provider in Europe, where it does business with 11 of the top 20 utility companies, including Eon, Total and Engie.</p> <p>Unlike some of its American competitors, Tado's thermostats work with 18,000 heating and air-conditioning systems across Europe, encompassing about 900 manufacturers. Tado claims this covers 95 per cent of households on the continent, where it is hoping to capitalise on upcoming climate measures.</p> <p>“The EU's proposed Green New Deal, and a wave of country-specific regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, is leading to a surge in demand for smart home devices, both from tenants and landlords,” co-founder Christian Deilmann told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Roughly 30 per cent of Tado's revenues come from Germany, its largest market, where CO2 pricing for the heating sector, introduced this year, has led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ea8adb8-a2af-4ccc-8f2c-29b3fd78625c\">increased interest</a> in energy-saving technologies.</p> <p>Amazon, which first invested in Tado via its Alexa Fund in 2018, also joined this latest financing round. The US group has ended up acquiring some of the fund's early investments, such as video-doorbell company Ring, which it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75c0cf0c-1e0e-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6\">bought for more than $1bn</a>, three years ago.</p> <p>However Tado currently also works closely with Amazon's competitors, including Google. It was a launch partner of Apple's HomeKit, and the iPhone maker also sells Tado's devices in its physical and online stores. </p> <p>Toon Bouten, Tado's chief executive, said the company was “already operationally profitable, once you strip out investment costs, and very close to being profitable as a business”. </p> <p>The company, which is increasingly focusing on selling its products directly to energy providers, said there were no plans to merge with Noventic, the property tech company that led its latest financing round. </p><p>Source: Joe Miller in Frankfurt 2021 'Amazon-backed Tado raises $46m in final fundraising round' FT.com 17 May.
