  "title": "Professional Cornhole Has a Cheating Scandal Called BagGate; Officials talk of new regulations to root out illegally sized bags. Fans are reeling: 'The dirty underbelly is being exposed.'",
  "text": "<p>\"I thought the bags were too thin,\" recalls Devon Harbaugh, who lodged a complaint against rivals Mark Richards and Philip Lopez.</p><p>At stake was a $15,000 prize in a game where players toss bags of resin beads into a small hole in slanted boards placed 27 feet apart.</p><p>With the cornhole world watching live on ESPN, officials inspected the bags with the solemnity required for such a grave complaint. Then they huddled near sponsor banners for Johnsonville sausage products and Bush's baked beans.</p><p>It was true—the bags weren't regulation size. \"They're too small,\" color commentator Mark Pryor exclaimed to viewers. \"That's going to create some drama.\"</p><p>Drama? That is only half of it.</p><p>Messrs. Lopez and Richards asked officials to check their opponents' bags, too. Turns out, they weren't compliant, either.</p><p>This now infamous incident is known to fans as BagGate and it has sparked a frenzy in the game that started in the backyard, enjoyed between swings of beer.</p><p>New regulations are brewing and there is talk of a crackdown to root out iffy bags. The evolving sport is proving it's never just fun and games when money is tossed in the mix.</p><p>\"I think it's funny that anyone believed it would be all friendships and rose petals forever in cornhole,\" wrote one commenter on the Addicted to Cornhole Facebook page, which has 85,000 members. \"Now the dirty underbelly is being exposed.\"</p><p>Cornhole is growing quickly, with big-name sponsors and serious athletes. The ACL boasts about 155,000 members, up from 125,000 in 2021. The total number of events tops 22,000, from about 14,000 last year. Top ACL players can make up to $250,000 a year from winnings, endorsements and sponsorship deals.</p><p>Since a lighter, thinner bag could provide an advantage, some players are boiling bags or washing them with vinegar to try to make them more pliable and slick. Others are bringing out the sandpaper, hammers and rubber mallets.</p><p>\"You have the average players that try everything to make the bag do different things,\" says Nate Voyer, a cornhole professional who prefers to wash his bag with a little fabric softener and let it air dry.</p><p>He knows a player who lays plywood over his bag and drives a car over it. That crosses into a gray area in Mr. Voyer's view because it could crush the resin beads into smaller pieces. Cornhole pros are generally good people, he adds, \"but all it takes is one bad apple.\"</p><p>Cornhole bags, according to ACL regulations, must be 6 by 6 inches when laid flat, and weigh 16 ounces—with slight specified variations tolerated.</p><p>After a one-hour delay, officials at the world championships decided no intentional violations had taken place and opted to continue the contest. Was there cheating? \"It's possible, but I'm pretty confident that it wasn't intentional,\" says ACL spokesman Trey Ryder.</p><p>It absolutely wasn't cheating, the players say. Mr. Harbaugh says he doesn't know how his teams' bags shrunk below the legal limit. \"Honestly it could be anything,\" he says. \"Definitely unintentional.\"</p><p>On the other side, Mr. Lopez says, \"I don't know how they became illegal-sized. We did not boil the bags.\"</p><p>The ACL is now introducing more structure into the sport. \"We've really had to crack down to make sure that all these bags are to spec,\" says Mr. Ryder. \"Internally we've had to invest more into our compliance.\"</p><p>He says the ACL upped the rigor of testing for the types of bags that will be allowed in 2023 and rejected more bags than ever for this coming season. The organization also plans random bag checks at tournaments, he says, and is \"exploring infrastructure for automated bag testing\" to cut down on guesswork.</p><p>\"We believe we are taking a major step,\" Mr. Ryder adds.</p><p>At the American Cornhole Association, which calls itself the Original and Official Governing Body of Cornhole, President Eric Marvin compares cornhole's growth to that of pickleball. That sport was a sleeping giant until leaders took it mainstream, he says.</p><p>The ACA says it expects to release new team rules and regulations for the game by the end of the year. \"You're going to see some big shifts and movements in the infrastructure of the sport,\" Mr. Marvin says. \"This is when sports evolve.\"</p><p>Cornhole professional Jay Corley, from Virginia, says the sport's rapid growth points to one thing: \"I think we're going to have to go to having a referee just like any other sport.\"</p><p>Mr. Corley, once an amateur, now competes around his job in licensing at the Virginia Department of Health. He studies the philosophies of fellow athletes Michael Jordan and Derek Jeter, and no longer drinks when he plays. \"I want to take care of my body as a professional athlete,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Voyer, another professional, left a school administrator job to teach in Stockton, Calif. That gives him time to play the pro tour all summer, where he is sponsored by Mercedes.</p><p>\"Now, I get money to play a backyard game,\" he says. \"Are you kidding me?\"</p><p>Professional Cornhole Has a Cheating Scandal Called BagGate</p>",
