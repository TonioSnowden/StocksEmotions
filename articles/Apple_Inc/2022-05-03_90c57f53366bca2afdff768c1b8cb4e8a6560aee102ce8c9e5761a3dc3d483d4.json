  "text": "<p>Even though it dropped below a March 8 closing low last Friday, \"daily trading in the index still resembles most of the post-Financial Crisis growth scares that we've previously highlighted as being useful reference points for how low U.S. equities could trade in 2022,\" the pair explain.</p><p>During those \"scares\" — the 2010 European debt crisis, the 2011 U.S. debt downgrade, the earnings/industrial recession of 2015-16 and the late 2018 China trade war/quantitative tightening selloff — equity declines ranged from 14% to 20%, for an average drop of 17.7%.</p><p>\"As of Friday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 13.9% below its January 2022 peak, putting it close to the range of a typical growth scare. If a median growth scare drawdown of 17.7% occurs, the S&amp;P 500 would fall to ~3,950 this time around, while a late-2018-type drawdown of -19.8% would take the S&amp;P 500 to ~3,850,\" said Calvasina and Mahaffy. That's even if the economy can avoid recession.</p><p>And if they are wrong in their core belief that recession can be avoided, they see much downside ahead, as \"recession drawdowns since the 1920s for the S&amp;P 500 have averaged ~32% vs. their prerecession peaks.\"</p><p>The pair are also keeping a close eye on weekly Commodity Futures Trading Commission data on asset manager positioning in U.S. equity futures. While signs of retail bearishness are everywhere, the institutional side isn't quite there yet, they note. \"And it may simply be that in order for the U.S. equity market to bottom, institutional investor sentiment needs to catch down to retail.\"</p><p>\"This indicator attempted to put in a bottom in Nasdaq and Russell 2000 contracts in March after hitting levels that had marked important lows/turning points in the past,\" but never returned to those lows, meaning institutional capitulation isn't quite in.</p><p>Read: Recession fears are growing.
