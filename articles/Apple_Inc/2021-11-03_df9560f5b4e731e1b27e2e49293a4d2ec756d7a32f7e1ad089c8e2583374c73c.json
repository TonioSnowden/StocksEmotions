  "title": "Qualcomm Posts Record Sales Amid Surging Demand for 5G Smartphones; Company predicts shipments of 500 million to 550 million 5G handsets this year despite chip shortage",
  "text": "<p>Chief Executive Cristiano Amon, who took the top job in June, has been pushing the company to grow beyond its traditional mobile-chip business. The company closed the fiscal year with combined revenue topping $10 billion for some of non-handset growth businesses, including those focused on the automotive sector and internet-of-things devices.</p><p>Qualcomm has said it has taken extra steps to snare chip supply at a time of unprecedented shortages, including having multiple vendors producing the same type of chip to boost supply. Apple Inc., a Qualcomm customer, last week warned that supply-chain disruptions would become increasingly challenging during the important holiday-shopping quarter.</p><p>Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said the chip shortages could last into 2023. ON Semiconductor Corp. CEO Hassane El-Khoury, on an earnings call this week, said, \"We expect demand to remain robust and outpace supply through most of 2022.\"</p><p>Qualcomm said sales in the current quarter should reach $10 billion to $10.8 billion.</p><p>The San Diego-based chip company's shares, which rose 2.4% Wednesday, advanced more than 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.</p><p>The company expects 500 million to 550 million shipments of 5G handsets this year. In the prior quarter, it said it had an upward bias for shipments in the range of 450 million to 550 million units.</p><p>As part of Mr. Amon's push for Qualcomm to be recognized for more than a supply for chips for smartphones, the company last month teamed up with investment firm SSW Partners to acquire Swedish auto-technology company Veoneer Inc. in the face of a competing bidder in a $4.5 billion takeover to further its autonomous-driving ambitions.</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Qualcomm Posts Record Sales Amid Surging Demand for 5G Smartphones</p>",
