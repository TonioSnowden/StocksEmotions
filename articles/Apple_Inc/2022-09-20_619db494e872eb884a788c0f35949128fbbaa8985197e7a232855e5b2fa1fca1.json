  "title": "'Serial' Rises on Podcast Charts After Adnan Syed Conviction Is Vacated; Show had raised questions about the murder case in its first season in 2014; releases new episode after judge's ruling",
  "text": "<p>The podcast was the No. 1 show in the U.S. on Apple Inc.'s platform Tuesday afternoon after the release of a new 17-minute episode called \"Adnan Is Out.\" It was the 26th most popular podcast on Spotify Technology SA's U.S. list.</p><p>Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 for the murder of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year-old high-school student and his ex-girlfriend. Mr. Syed was 17 years old at the time of the crime and was charged as an adult. He had been serving a life sentence.</p><p>The first season of \"Serial\" and a later HBO docuseries raised questions about Mr. Syed's involvement in the fatal strangling of Ms. Lee in 1999, helping spur attempts to revive his case in recent years.</p><p>\"You might be asking, what on earth happened?\" Sarah Koenig, the host of \"Serial,\" said in the new episode Tuesday. \"I've spent the last few days trying to understand it myself.\"</p><p>Last week, the state's attorney for Baltimore City asked the court to vacate Mr. Syed's first-degree murder conviction, saying a nearly yearlong investigation had revealed new evidence.</p><p>At a hearing Monday in Baltimore's Circuit Court, Judge Melissa Phinn found the state had grounds to vacate the conviction \"in the interest of justice and fairness.\" Mr. Syed was released under home detention, and Judge Phinn said the state would have 30 days to set a new trial date, should it choose to.</p><p>Prosecutors said they weren't asserting that Mr. Syed was innocent, but that he is entitled to a new trial. Mr. Syed, now 41, has maintained his innocence.</p><p>Young Lee, Ms. Lee's brother, said in court Monday that he felt blindsided and betrayed by the state's motion to vacate Mr. Syed's conviction.</p><p>\"It's really tough going through this again and again and again and again,\" Mr. Lee said.</p><p>The podcast, which has explored a new case with each season, has remained popular. In the second quarter of this year, \"Serial\" was the 12th-most listened to podcast, according to Edison Research, which surveys 8,000 people on their podcast preferences. It was still in the top 10 as recently as last year, Edison Research said.</p><p>The third season of \"Serial\"—its most recent season—was released in 2018.</p><p>A representative for the podcast didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>'Serial' Rises on Podcast Charts After Adnan Syed Conviction Is Vacated</p>",
