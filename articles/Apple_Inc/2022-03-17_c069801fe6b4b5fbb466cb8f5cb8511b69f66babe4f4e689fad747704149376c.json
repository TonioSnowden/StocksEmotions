  "title": "2022 Jeep Wagoneer's Massive Appeal; The silhouette of the new Wagoneer is meant to be big, boxy and imposing, writes Dan Neil, a heavy-duty package aimed at buyers of gargantuan luxury SUVs",
  "text": "<p>The view from the crosswalk is likewise impressive. I parked the test vehicle with its air suspension in Rock mode, lifting the belly of the beast 10 inches off the ground. When I stood in front, the ON in the Wagoneer's front badging was level with my nose. I wonder what that would taste like?</p><p>The Wagoneer is also extra-wide: 94 inches, mirror wingtip-to-wingtip. Buyers should keep the proverbial can of bear grease to ease passage through drive-throughs and airport parking.</p><p>And this isn't even the big one: the worst-kept secret in Motown is a forthcoming long-wheelbase version to compete with Suburban, Navigator L and Escalade ESV. Good news, equestrians, now your horse doesn't have to ride in the trailer.</p><p>For another day: the fetishizing of size in the luxury SUV segment, its sociological causes and shared costs, including the increased risk to pedestrians. For now, it's worth noting the Wagoneer fairly bristles with standard-equipment safety systems, including full-speed forward collision alert; pedestrian/cyclist emergency braking; and rear blind-spot and cross-path detection.</p><p>Our example also demoed the optional Convenience Group ($3,795), including pedestrian and animal detection and night vision, beamed into the heads-up display. Given the Wagoneer's frontal acreage, those features would make excellent no-cost options, don't you think, Jeep? All parties served, hmm?</p><p>The Grand Wagoneer trademark was last applied to a stand-alone model in 1991, on an SUV fondly remembered for its woodgrain appliqués, inside and out, like roach-resistant shelf paper. This one is a lot classier, even in its base trim ($58,995), which is powered by a lightly hybridized 5.7-liter, 392-hp V8. Or you can have one like our tester, a Grand Wagoneer Series II Obsidian, priced at $113,120.</p><p>Sorry. I know that number hits people like a left hook below the belt. Six figures for a Jeep? I shoulda warned you. Take deep breaths. Timekeeper, five minutes….</p><p>Underhood is Mopar Legacy Classique: the slugging, chugging 6.4-liter Hemi-V8 gasser (471 hp/455 lb-ft), harnessed to an eight-speed transmission, two-speed transfer case, limited-slip rear differential, full-time four-wheel drive. Hoo-rah.</p><p>Our guy was fitted with the Heavy-duty Trailer Tow package ($995), which adds trailer-brake control, additional engine cooling and various towing/hitching aids. So equipped, the GW claims a best-in-class towing capacity of 9,850 pounds.</p><p>In the morning, the Hemi V8's cold-start cycle sounds like Jack Kennedy is firing up the old PT 109, but the engine quickly settles into a turgid throb. Considering the fine-tolerance machinations that move this monster down the road, the powertrain's slick engagement and ease of effort is pretty great. But then Jeep—owned by Stellantis—had years to evolve this powertrain.</p><p>The agreeably soft ride and level road-holding character come courtesy of the four-corner air suspension, with semi-active damping and five ride-height settings. The system's accumulator bottle, mounted behind the front bumper, is enormous—a hint of the kind of pressure required to damp and stabilize the oscillating mass above.</p><p>Swing wide, ye driver's door of temptation: The interior space is cavernous, and its décor gorgeous and sophisticated, damn it. To ingress, step upon the motorized running board deployed for your convenience, or else take a flying leap into the driver's seat. The height-adjustable foot-pedal assembly, the tilt/telescopic power-adjustable steering wheel and the 20-way adjustable seat allow one size (XXL) to fit all.</p><p>I don't want to know where Jeep gets \"Palermo\" leather, but it sure is soft.</p><p>Look at all the switches, the rows of backlit buttons, the toggles! Somebody sure got the memo about touch-screen-only interfaces. The broad center console hosts the large rotary gear selector and clusters of switches, tapping into camera functions, towing and parking assists. Most if not all of these switches are redundant with those in the touch-screen menus.</p><p>Oh yeah, screens too. A handsome two-tier 12-inch wide touch screen array dominates the center bulkhead. Another touch screen for the front passenger is concealed in the lacquer-like dash trim. That display is polarized so that the driver can't see it to be distracted. Good thing, too, since I couldn't have reached the off button from the driver's seat.</p><p>In Grand Wagoneer models, a sweeping center console separates the heated/ventilated mid-row recliners. The Rear Seat Entertainment system with Amazon Fire TV ($2,195) provides touch screens for each position. Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G LTE Wi-Fi HotSpot—you could keep all of that and just leave me the McIntosh 23-speaker audiophile system. Make a grown man cry.</p><p>The third-row bench seating—usually the penalty box for family members—is easy to step into and notably spacious, with softly padded armrests, climate outlets and USB ports.</p><p>Compared to my college roommate's Grand Wagoneer, the new one is a galaxy-hopping starship. And yet, by way of grim coincidence, the old and new get about the same observed gas mileage, in the neighborhood of 11-13 mpg.</p><p>After decades of advancement in internal-combustion technology, how could that be? Easy. All of the above content—the air suspension, the triple-panel skylights, the boxed-steel ladder frame, the 23-speaker sound system—gravitates. A fully loaded Obsidian like ours weighs 6,400 pounds.</p><p>That, I'll never get used to.</p><p>2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer Obsidian 4x4</p><p>Price, as tested: $113,120</p><p>Powertrain: Naturally aspirated 6.4-liter OHV V8 engine; eight-speed automatic transmission; two-speed on-demand transfer case; limited-slip rear differential; full-time four-wheel drive</p><p>Power/torque: 471 hp at 6,000 rpm/455 lb-ft at 4,400 rpm</p><p>Length/wheelbase/width/height: 214.7/123.0/94.0 (mirrors out)/75.6 inches</p><p>Curb weight: 6,400 pounds</p><p>0-60 mph: 6 seconds</p><p>Max. towing capacity: 9,850 pounds</p><p>EPA fuel economy: 13/18/15 mpg city /highway/combined</p><p>Cargo capacity: 27.4/70.9/94.2 cubic feet (behind 3rd/2nd/1st-row seat backs)</p><p>2022 Jeep Wagoneer's Massive Appeal</p>",
