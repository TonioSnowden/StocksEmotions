  "title": "Why 'Pachinko' Author Min Jin Lee Is Still Afraid of Failure; The writer whose novel was turned into a series for Apple TV+ talks about the fleeting nature of success and how such themes thread through her work",
  "text": "<p>Fear of failure is a theme that runs through Ms. Lee's work. Her first novel, 2007's \"Free Food for Millionaires,\" follows Casey Han, the American daughter of Korean immigrants who craves a high-end Manhattan lifestyle she can't afford, despite recently graduating without a job with an economics degree from Princeton. Her second novel ten years later, \"Pachinko,\" chronicled four generations of a poor Korean immigrant family in 20th-century Japan, struggling to reevaluate and define what constitutes success and failure.</p><p>In the interview Ms. Lee, 53, said she still fights regularly with feelings of failure, and talked about how she pushes through it. Edited excerpts:</p><p>Am I wrong to say failure is something you've thought a lot about?</p><p>I think failure is my middle name at this point, so yeah. I think my problem is that I really want too much. So because I want too much and I want things in the way I want them in my own absurd standards, of course I fail them consistently.</p><p>How does failure factor into your life?</p><p>A couple of years ago, right after I got the announcement for being a finalist with the National Book Award for my second book, my husband lost his job. So I needed to find something because our family needed health insurance. A friend of mine got me an interview for a place to teach, and I walked in and the person was incredibly unkind. It was a very, very short interview. And she said to me, how did you get to my desk? And I walked out of that interview and I just sobbed on the street because I thought, oh, here I am, I'm 48 years old, I need health insurance.</p><p>Both \"Free Food for Millionaires\" and \"Pachinko\" have opening lines that reveal a lot of deep thinking about failure. Let's start with your first novel. What do you mean by \"competence can be a curse\"?</p><p>Oh, that's a thesis statement of \"Free Food for Millionaires.\" I was really trying to say that sometimes when you're good enough, at most things, you don't know what you're supposed to do. So, I was critiquing this idea of a person who can pretty much generally pick up things and then not know who she is herself.</p><p>What about the first line of Pachinko, which is \"History has failed us, but no matter?\"</p><p>I was arguing that history has failed every ordinary person in the entire world since the beginning of time, because for the most part, history is a record of winners or catastrophic losers, but they're not about regular people who have to function. But the subordinate clause of that sentence is very important to me because in my research, what I have learned is that ordinary people don't care. They just keep going and they try to survive and make the best of things. And it's very empowering to think of that way because if you are waiting around for recognition that you are somehow important enough to be recorded and that never happens to you, does that mean that your life didn't matter? Of course not.</p><p>You're working on a third novel now, \"American Hagwon.\" Is the first line of that one is also about failure? Do you know yet?</p><p>Oh, I'll tell you what the first line is. I probably shouldn't, but I will. And it's \"The rules of engagement have changed already.\"</p><p>And where is that going to take us?</p><p>It's about some young people who open a hagwon, a private tutoring center. And it becomes very powerful in the world. I'm writing about the value of education for Koreans around the world, but I'm really asking the question: What is wisdom? I think we are living in a time where things are moving so quickly, the constructs and the theories and our contexts are changing so quickly that human beings could barely catch up. And we are living in an age of anxiety.</p><p>You are now a bestselling author. Your novel \"Pachinko\" has been turned into an Apple TV+ series. Do you feel like you can call yourself a success now?</p><p>I think that I've achieved some of the goals that I've set, and I feel fortunate that I get to do what I think I want to do. I get to write more books. I'm really grateful for the readership that I have, but do I think of myself as a success? Not really. But I don't think of myself as a failure either. I guess what I'm really trying to say is I don't really like the metrics of the world. I think we have it all wrong.</p><p>Why 'Pachinko' Author Min Jin Lee Is Still Afraid of Failure</p>",
