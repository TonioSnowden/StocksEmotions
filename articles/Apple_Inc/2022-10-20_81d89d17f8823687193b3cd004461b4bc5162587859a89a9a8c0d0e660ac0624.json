  "title": "A French Farmhouse in the Middle of New Mexico Lists for $5.9 Million; In a suburb of Albuquerque, the fully-furnished, five-bedroom home will be one of the area's priciest listings",
  "text": "<p>Located in the village of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, the fully furnished, five-bedroom home will be one of the most expensive for sale in the area, said listing agent Joe Maez of the Maez Group. Currently, the most expensive home on the market in the village is asking $3.5 million.</p><p>Mr. Martinez, founder of Picasso Builders, said he bought the roughly 2-acre property for $1.1 million in 2019. It was among the first in the area to sell for over $1 million, added Mr. Maez.</p><p>The property contained an approximately 6,800-square-foot, 1989 Southwestern house. Mr. Martinez demolished much of the home, keeping only a small portion, and added roughly 3,500 square feet.</p><p>He gave the exterior an old-farmhouse feel. A roof was built from reclaimed clay tiles imported from France and steel headers were placed over the windows. A long driveway is lined with crab apple trees that blossom in the spring. \"We left everything really natural,\" he said, \"playing along with those old French farm homes and estates.\"</p><p>The driveway leads to a large courtyard surrounded by cottonwood trees and willows. The courtyard contains a swimming pool designed to resemble a lake.</p><p>Inside the home, finishes include wood-beam ceilings, French oak floors, clay plastered walls, and Italian porcelain tile. A screening room with crushed velvet sofas leads to a bar and a game room, where a pool table is built into a 1959 Corvette. There are two indoor kitchens; the primary one has over $100,000 worth of custom French-designed appliances and a hydroponic herb garden, said Mr. Martinez. Adjacent to the game room is an outdoor kitchen and a sports court for basketball and pickleball.</p><p>Write to Libertina Brandt at Libertina.Brandt@wsj.com</p><p>A French Farmhouse in the Middle of New Mexico Lists for $5.9 Million</p>",
