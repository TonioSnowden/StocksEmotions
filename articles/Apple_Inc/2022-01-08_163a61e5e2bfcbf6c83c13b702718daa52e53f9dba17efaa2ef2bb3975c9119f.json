  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Eating & Drinking -- Slow Food Fast:  Potato Salad With Prosciutto, Parmesan, Parsley and Apples  ----  By Kitty Greenwald",
  "text": "<p>\n  [SATISFYING AND SEASONAL FOOD IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Chef: Anne Quatrano </p><p>\n  Her Restaurants: Bacchanalia, Floataway Cafe, Star Provisions Market and Cafe, W.H. Stils Fish Camp, all in Atlanta </p><p>\n  What She's Known For: Lifting up Atlanta's food scene with elegant farm-to-table dishes for over 25 years. Timeless ingredient-focused cooking and smart moves that reveal the chef's original style. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  After feeding guests in her Atlanta restaurants for nearly three decades, chef Anne Quatrano knows their appetites, and the way they shift with the seasons. \"In the New Year people are thinking about eating less meat and more vegetables,\" she said. \"This recipe is perfect for that.\" Just a few thin slices of prosciutto give this warm potato salad a rich flavor and feel. Fresh herbs, tart apple slices, curls of Parmesan and a mustard-shallot vinaigrette round out this comforting meal and give it an invigorating punch. </p><p>\n  Waxy fingerling potatoes hold their shape and their satisfying texture once they've boiled, and you'll want to get them into that mustardy vinaigrette right away after cooking. \"I peel each one by hand and then slice it directly into the dressing,\" Ms. Quatrano said. \"Potatoes are so porous. They need to be seasoned while they're hot.\" The potatoes should be quite dry before you dress them, too, for maximum absorption. Toss the apple slices in lemon juice to prevent browning, and add them just before serving to preserve their snap. </p><p>\n  As always, a little prosciutto goes a long way. If you want to omit it altogether, this makes a great vegetarian recipe, too. The same goes for the cheese, if you'd like to make this recipe vegan. \"It's adaptable,\" Ms. Quatrano said. \"We've been serving this for 20 years.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Total Time: 30 minutes </p><p>\n  Serves: 4 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Kosher salt </p><p>\n  2 pounds fingerling potatoes </p><p>\n  1 shallot, minced </p><p>\n  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard </p><p>\n  2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar </p><p>\n  2 tablespoons grapeseed oil </p><p>\n  1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, mint or flat-leaf parsley </p><p>\n  2 crisp apples </p><p>\n  Juice of 1/2 lemon </p><p>\n  Parmesan, shaved with a vegetable peeler, to garnish </p><p>\n  4 slices prosciutto di Parma </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil potatoes until tender, about 18 minutes. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, whisk together shallots, mustard, vinegar and grapeseed oil. Let sit while potatoes cook. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. Strain potatoes and toss dry. Return potatoes to their dry, hot pot to dry them further and keep them warm. Working quickly with a sharp paring knife, peel away and discard the potatoes' skins, then slice potatoes crosswise into 1/4 -inch-thick rounds, transferring slices to bowl with vinaigrette and tossing as you go. Once all potato slices are in bowl, toss again gently to combine, then season with salt. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4. Before serving, thinly slice apples. In a small bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. To serve, spread warm potato salad across a serving platter. Toss in half the herbs. Top with apple slices and 8-12 Parmesan shavings. Drape prosciutto over salad and garnish with remaining herbs. Serve warm or at room temperature. </p><p></p>",
