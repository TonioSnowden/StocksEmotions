  "text": "<p>Shanghai is set for the most significant easing of Covid-19 restrictions since it was sealed off more than two months ago, after authorities said public transport would resume and shops reopen from Wednesday.</p> <p>Officials unveiled the changes, which eliminate the need for residents of low-risk housing compounds to gain approval to leave their homes, ahead of a June 1 deadline that paves the way for a gradual reopening across a city where restrictions are still widespread.</p> <p>Barriers designed to keep people inside their buildings were dismantled this week and citizens returned in small numbers to streets that were recently deserted as part of the most notable lockdown in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/chinese-politics-policy\">China</a> since the closure of Wuhan in 2020.</p> <p>The easing signalled a shift in tone for the country's biggest city, which has come to embody the government's nationwide recommitment to <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/china-covid-economy/\">zero-Covid policies</a> despite their mounting social and economic costs.</p> <p>“Tomorrow, our city will usher in a new beginning,” Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin said on Tuesday. “This is a day that we have for a long time hoped for, and paid a price for.”</p> <p>But residents in compounds with coronavirus cases in the past 14 days will remain under lockdown, restaurants will still be closed and shops will open at limited capacity, highlighting the tentative process of reopening in a city that has constructed a vast apparatus of preventive measures.</p> <p>Shanghai initially imposed a lockdown on March 28 that was supposed to last for eight days across two halves of the city but was extended as part of a process that has been characterised by uncertainty.</p> <p>While authorities said in mid-April that compounds with no cases in the past two weeks would be reopened, many residents were still detained because they could not obtain the required written approval to go outside. From Wednesday, no such approval is needed.</p> <p>A Shanghai government social media announcement this week clarified that committees in charge of districts, towns and compounds should “not for any reason restrain access for residents living in the community”, unless they were in medium or high-risk areas with recent cases, or closed-off areas in quarantine. </p> <p>“The point at which we're at right now is where the rhetoric is meeting the activity,” said Peter Alexander, a managing director at Z-Ben, a fund consultancy in Shanghai. Alexander said he was drinking champagne on the street in the central district of Jing'An where there were a few dozen other people. </p> <p>“What was really happening was, no one in Shanghai wanted to take the responsibility,” he said. “You have the community area, the district, the subdistrict, the city and no one wanted to take the responsibility of opening up for fear there might be another surge.”</p> <p>Shanghai reported zero positive infections outside quarantined areas on Tuesday, and 29 within them.</p> <p>Data released on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity across China contracted in May, albeit at a slower rate than in April, while Apple supplier Foxconn said it was confident supply chains would recover in the second half of the year.</p> <p>Authorities will also allow citizens in low-risk areas to return to work from Wednesday. A Shanghai white-collar professional surnamed Yi, who received an offer from a biotech company before the lockdown, said she had been notified to go to work for the first time on Wednesday. “It's all so sudden,” she said. “I feel I'm not prepared to meet my colleagues.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai</em></p><p>Source: Thomas Hale in Hong Kong 2022 'Shanghai on course to reopen after two months of lockdown' FT.com 31 May.
