  "title": "Yes, the S&P 500 is climbing, but this is not yet a bull market; Reduce but don't abandon that core bearish position",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P SPX had found support in the 3720-3740 area on seven separate days, so that is support. This current rally has already overcome minor resistance at 3920 and 3945 and now has its sights set on closing the gap at 4017.</p><p>Above there, resistance gets stronger. First, there is the trading range from early June: 4070-4170. Also, the +4σ \"modified Bollinger Band\" is at 4050. A move above 4170 would certainly be a game-changer and would be reason to upgrade the SPX chart to \"bullish,\" but that is a long way from happening.</p><p>Equity-only put-call ratios have confirmed their recent buy signals by moving below their early June lows. So these important indicators will remain bullish as long as they are declining.</p><p>Breadth has improved as well, although that has been ongoing for a few weeks now. Both breadth oscillators are on buy signals, and they are in modestly overbought territory. It is a positive development when the breadth oscillators get overbought early in a new leg upward by SPX.</p><p>Of course, it is imperative that they hold these overbought levels, because if a couple of negative breadth days occur, they could easily flip back to sell signals.</p><p>The one area that has shown no improvement is that of new 52-week highs versus lows. The number of NYSE new highs has been woeful for nearly a month now and shows very little sign of improvement. Therefore, this indicator remains on a sell signal.</p><p>VIX VIX has fallen somewhat as this rally has progressed, and that is generally bullish for stocks. The \"spike peak\" buy signal of June 15 has \"expired.\" By that I mean that the trading system that we built around these \"spike peaks\" on the VIX chart calls for a 22-day holding period, and that has now expired. That is not a sell signal but is merely the termination of the most recent buy signal.</p><p>Furthermore, VIX has closed below its 200-day moving average. That is a major development in that it means that VIX is no longer trending higher on an intermediate-term basis. Hence the sell signal (for stocks) that was in place because of the higher-trending VIX no longer exists. However, this is not a buy signal. The 20-day MA of VIX would have to cross below the 200-day MA for there to be a buy signal, and that is still some ways off: the 20-day MA is at 27 and falling, while the 200-day MA is at 24 and slowly rising.</p><p>Finally, the construct of volatility derivatives VX00 remains modestly bullish in that the term structure of the VIX futures slopes slightly upward in the front end of the curve. August VIX futures are now the front month, so we will be watching the relationship between August and September VIX futures. If August were to rise above September, that would be bearish.</p><p>In summary, we are reducing our \"core\" bearish position because of the improvements on the VIX chart, but we will not abandon it totally until there is improvement on the SPX chart. Meanwhile, we are trading the buy signals from the other indicators around that reduced core bearish position.</p><p>New recommendation: SPY bull spread</p><p>Due to the improvements in a number of indicators, as noted in the market commentary above, we are going to add another SPY SPY call bull spread to our positions. These improvements include buy signals from the equity-only put-call ratios, buy signals from the breadth oscillators, and VIX closing below 24.</p><p>Buy 2 SPY Aug (19th) at-the-money calls</p><p>And sell 2 SPY Aug (19th) calls with a striking price 15 points higher.</p><p>As usual, roll the spread up if SPY trades at the higher strike. We will stop ourselves out of this trade in the following manner: sell half if the breadth oscillators roll back over to sell signals and sell half if the equity-only put-call ratios roll back to sell signals. We will update these indicators weekly.</p><p>New recommendation: Amylyx Pharmaceuticals</p><p>This recommendation is based solely on the recent performance of Amylyx Pharmaceuticals AMLX and its movement to new relative highs. Even though the stock chart is positive, it is necessary to trade this recommendation with call options to limit the risk. This is a stock that could drop sharply if there were bad news on a drug trial.</p><p>Buy 3 AMLX Aug (19th) 22.5 calls</p><p>At a price of 3.00 or less.</p><p>AMLX: 22.30 Aug (19th) 22.5 calls: 2.20 bid, offered at 4.00</p><p>Stop yourself out on a close below 18 by AMLX.</p><p>Follow-up action</p><p>All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted.</p><p>We are going to implement a \"standard\" rolling procedure for our SPY spreads: in any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread, or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration, and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed.</p><p>Long 2 SPY Aug (19th) 366 puts and short 2 SPY Aug (19th) 346 puts: We originally bought this spread in line with the sell signal from the trend of VIX. It was rolled down twice. VIX has now closed below its 200-day moving average, which is currently just below 24, so sell these spreads now. We will re-enter if $VIX rises back above its 200-day moving average.</p><p>Long 0 KOD July (15th) 10 calls: These calls expired worthless.</p><p>Long 1 SPY July (22nd) 382 call and short 1 SPY July (22nd) 397 call: This spread was originally bought in line with the most recent VIX \"spike peak\" buy signal of June 15. Under the trading system we developed to trade these \"spike peak\" buy signals, it is now time to exit this spread and take the profits.</p><p>Long 3 AMLX Aug (19th) 22.5 calls: These calls were rolled up; the closing stop remains at 17.00.</p><p>Long 1 SPY Aug (19th) 378 call and short 1 SPY Aug (19th) 398 call: This spread was bought in line with the McMillan Volatility Band (MVB) buy signal. Its target is for SPX to touch the +4σ Band. The signal would be stopped out if SPX were to close below the -4σ Band.</p><p>Long 10 CRNT Aug (19th) 2.5 calls: Hold while the takeover rumors play out.</p><p>Long 2 COWN Aug (19th) 30 calls: The stock has moved higher as the rumors persist. Continue to hold without a stop.</p><p>Long 2 AAPL Sep (16th) 150 calls: We will hold these as long as the put-call ratio buy signal remains in effect.</p><p>Send questions to: lmcmillan@optionstrategist.com.</p><p>Lawrence G.
