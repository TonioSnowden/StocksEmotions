  "text": "<p>   For Joe and Cristina Prusz, making the decision to move their family to Austin, Texas, from Santa Monica, Calif., was the easy part. \"We wanted a slower pace of life but didn't want to give up the vibrant atmosphere of a city; Austin fit the bill,\" said Mr. Prusz, 43, a digital-advertising executive and father of two. </p><p>   But finding a decent piece of Texas dirt to build their dream home was a lot harder. The Pruszes, who began the hunt last fall, were outbid on the first home site they chose, then lost the second in a last-minute bidding war. </p><p>   \"For the next few weeks we kept losing out on land deals,\" Mr. Prusz said. The couple switched gears and looked for a built home, but inventory was low and prices seemed ridiculous. They didn't even bother touring a house still under construction that was \"just a big box completely full of Home Depot fixtures priced at $3.5 million.\" Completed, it sold for $5.2 million. </p><p>   Finally, the Pruszes took a second look at a new 5,200-square-foot, five-bedroom home under construction in Tarrytown, a leafy neighborhood 10 minutes from downtown. When they first saw the house in September last year, the $4.3 million list price seemed too high. Two months later, it seemed reasonable. The Pruszes offered full asking price for the home in November 2020, closing in July. </p><p>   \"The crazy part is it was more expensive than our home in Los Angeles,\" said Mr. Prusz, who sold the family's 3,200-square-foot Santa Monica home for $3.945 million in December last year. He now works remotely from a home office converted from a bedroom by Ms. Prusz, 39, a stay-at-home mom with an interest in design, who also redid all the fixtures and installed a wine room at a total cost of about $100,000. </p><p>   Austin, capital of the Lone Star State, has become one of the hottest luxury-housing markets in the country, with the price per square foot for upscale homes jumping at a faster rate than those in New York and California metropolitan areas in the first three quarters of 2021. The entry-level list price for a luxury home -- defined as the top 5% of the market -- hit $2.34 million in 2021, an increase of nearly 33% over 2020 home prices, and a 44% rise over 2017 prices, according to data analysis by Realtor.com. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) </p><p>   \"When people come to town looking for big houses, they're not going to find them clicking on Zillow. We like to keep that inventory very off the radar,\" said Cord Shiflet, a real-estate agent with Moreland Properties and the incoming president of the Austin Board of Realtors. </p><p>   Right now, there isn't much inventory -- on the radar or off. </p><p>   Many would-be Austinites are coastal emigres drawn by the region's burgeoning tech industry. Oracle announced its planned move from Silicon Valley to Austin's Silicon Hills last December, and Apple will open a new $1 billion campus in north Austin next year. The most prominent Silicon Valley defector isElon Musk, who in October declared that Tesla would relocate its headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, where he is building a factory. Mr. Musk, who boasted over the summer that he was living in a tiny rental house on the campus of SpaceX, his commercial spaceflight company in Boca Chica, Texas, is now said to be hunting for an Austin estate with ample acreage and city views, according to people in the local real-estate industry. Mr. Musk couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   The Sunbelt city's laid-back atmosphere, its lively music and cultural scene, and its picturesque surroundings in Texas Hill Country are all attracters; so is Texas's lack of a personal income tax. </p><p>   Developers are scrambling to catch up. The Grove, a 75-acre mixed-use development with shops, restaurants and a park about 3 miles from downtown, began closings on 35 single-family homes in late 2019; 15 available homes, which will be released for sale through the end of this year, are priced from $2.15 million to $2.4 million. </p><p>   Justin Nolan, 40, vice president of business development for Argo Blockchain, a London-based cryptocurrency mining company, began looking for homes in Austin last winter, in part because he is developing a bitcoin mining facility in Dickens County, Texas. Mr. Nolan and his wife, Emily Nolan, a freelance television producer, were living with their three young sons in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where they owned a turn-of-the-century brownstone. </p><p>   Mr. Nolan thought the city seemed like a good fit for their family. \"What really drew us to Austin is while it's Texas, it doesn't have the same reputation as Texas. It's a newer, more tech-friendly city with a lot of young people,\" Mr. Nolan said. </p><p>   Mr. Nolan saw a house he liked. By the time he called the agent, it had sold. But the broker told him about an off-market listing that he had heard about at lunch that day: a 7,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style home with five bedrooms in Rollingwood, five minutes from downtown. </p><p>   Mr. Nolan declined to say what he paid for the house. Comparable homes in Rollingwood are priced between $4.5 million and $5.5 million, said Darin Walker of Kuper Sotheby's International Realty, who wasn't involved with the sale. </p><p>   Part of what makes Austin so appealing to out-of-staters is its Texas-lite vibe: a blue dot in a deep-red state. \"It's like Americana, but hippy-dippy,\" said Eliza Allen, 35, an attorney who moved toAustin's Allandale neighborhoodfrom Brooklyn with her husband, Greg Allen, 36, a tech entrepreneur inNovember 2020. </p><p>   The Allens, who have a 3-year-old daughter, bought a four-bedroom home that was under construction in the Allandale neighborhood after viewing it on a FaceTime tour with their real-estate agent and Alan Lane, the builder. The home, a 2,811-square-foot spec house, was listed at $1.3 million. The Allens got it for $1.401 million, beating a competing offer. </p><p></p>",
