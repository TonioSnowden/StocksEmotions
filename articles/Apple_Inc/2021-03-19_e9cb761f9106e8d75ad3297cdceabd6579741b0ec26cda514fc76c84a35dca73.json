  "text": "<p>The investor who transformed the sleepy Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust into one of the biggest in Britain through a series of bold bets on tech companies is stepping down.</p> <p>James Anderson, who has managed the £17.5bn trust since 2000, will step down in April next year, the investment trust, which is owned by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford, said on Friday.</p> <p>Taking over the trust in the wake of the dotcom bubble in 2000, Anderson was convinced that, far from a fad, tech would play an ever larger role in modern economies. That conviction prompted a series of early bets on companies including Apple, Facebook and, more recently, Tesla.</p> <p>Assets under management at the 112-year-old trust ballooned from £1.7bn in 2000 to £17.5bn today, while investors enjoyed a total return of more than 1,500 per cent over the same period. </p> <p>“James's approach of identifying and holding transformational growth companies has helped drive economic progress and delivered exceptional returns for shareholders, said Fiona McBain, chair of the trust. </p> <p>Tom Slater, who has jointly managed the trust with Anderson since 2015, will take sole control next year. Lawrence Burns, co-manager of Baillie Gifford's&#xa0;International Concentrated Growth Strategy trust, will join the trust as deputy manager.</p> <p>While the trust is not expected to shift away from a focus on pioneering tech groups, analysts warned that the strategy will face challenges.</p> <p>“Anderson's retirement plans ironically come at a time when the market's love affair with growth stocks has shown signs of cracks,” said Jason Hollands, managing director of Tilney Investment Management. </p> <p>Anderson warned in January that the controversial role social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter had during the recent political turmoil in the US means that regulatory scrutiny is likely to grow.</p> <p>However the pandemic has increased the appeal of so-called growth stocks. Assets at Scottish Mortgage hit a record £18bn in January, though have retreated since as the tech rally has faltered.</p> <p>Scottish Mortgage has more recently become known for its investment in Tesla. Despite selling a £1.2bn stake in the electric carmaker in September, Tesla still accounts for about 5 per cent of the trust's total assets. </p> <p>Its other large holdings include Tencent, Alibaba, Moderna, Nio and biotech company Illumina. </p> <p>“He [Anderson] is not a man content to simply make money for his investors but one who also wants to win an argument,” said Simon Elliott, an analyst at Winterflood Investment Trusts. </p><p>Source: Madison Darbyshire 2021 'Top tech investor Anderson to leave Scottish Mortgage after 20 years' FT.com 19 March.
