  "text": "<p>Snap has announced its most radical restructuring as the social media company seeks to reassure investors with scaled-back ambitions in the face of its slowest-ever growth.</p> <p>The Los Angeles-based company said on Wednesday that it was laying off a fifth of its 6,500-strong workforce and slashing investment in initiatives including augmented reality glasses, video content production and games — amid an advertising slump, increased competition and macroeconomic woes.</p> <p>The approach was welcomed by investors, with the shares jumping nearly 8.7 per cent to $10.88 on Wednesday.</p> <p>The shake-up is designed to reverse Snap's fortunes as it announced that its current quarter revenues were growing at the slowest pace since it went public in 2017; 8 per cent year on year, compared with 13 per cent in the second quarter. </p> <p>Chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f912bf20-865a-4250-8e97-d501b09b2624\">Evan Spiegel</a> said in a memo to staff that the figure was “well below what we were expecting earlier this year”, adding: “We must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market.”</p> <p>Popular with so-called Gen Z and Millennial people, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d572dd54-5d95-4da2-8155-f4d58484ee3c\">Snap's Snapchat </a>is one of the smaller social media networks, with around 350mn daily active users. The latest cuts and bleak outlook mark a striking volte-face for a company that posted blockbuster growth in the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, leading it to employ more people, acquire and invest in technology start-ups and develop products beyond its core Snapchat offering, where users post ephemeral content to friends.</p> <p>Boom times for social media groups in 2020 and 2021 have turned this year into a deep and broad stock sell-off amid high inflation and a wider economic slowdown, forcing the biggest tech groups such as Meta and Google to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e0185eb-66d9-4686-afe2-e7b1d12b4920\">freeze hiring</a> and implement other cost-cutting measures.</p> <p>Snap's shares have lost more than 76 per cent of their value in the year to date, after issuing a profit warning in May and posting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b87f969-0031-4306-84a8-8a1a5fdd1a3b\">bleak second-quarter results</a> in July.</p> <p>On top of tough macroeconomic conditions, it has also blamed its poor performance on increased competition in the sector and privacy changes by Apple that have made it harder for apps to target advertising and measure the success of campaigns.</p> <p>Snap has been particularly vulnerable, as advertisers tightening their budgets typically cull spending from the smallest operators first. </p> <p>Still, in its results statement in July, Snap said it was “not satisfied” with its earnings “regardless of the current headwinds”.</p> <p>Snap wrote in an investor presentation on Wednesday that it expected to generate savings of $500mn a year from the latest restructuring, compared with its second-quarter costs. It expects to spend between $110mn and $175mn doing so, which would mostly be incurred in the current quarter.</p> <p>Snap has always positioned itself as a “camera company” rather than a social media network and, as such, invested in hardware including the Pixy, a small drone camera that was discontinued this month, only four months after its launch.</p> <p>The company also announced it would be “narrowing its investment scope” in its long-touted augmented reality glasses, Spectacles, in order to “focus on highly differentiated long-term research and development efforts”. A senior manager at the company said its focus would be on mobile augmented reality experiences, rather than hardware.</p> <p>Investment will also be cut in Snap Originals, short-form video content produced in house, games and Snap Minis, where developers can build simplified versions of their apps within the main Snapchat app. </p> <p>Snap acquisitions Zenly, a social mapping app, and Voisey, an app to create music voice-overs, will both be shut down.</p> <p>Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said that Snap's renewed focus on profitability was a welcome change but that “it will take time for investors to regain confidence in the underlying fundamentals”. </p> <p>He added: “The decision to cut back in areas that generate little or no revenue is prudent,” and that “additional headcount reductions suggest [the] slowdown could be worse than feared”.</p> <p>Other analysts noted that Snap's 8 per cent revenue growth in the quarter to date was an improvement on the flat growth it disclosed in late July, indicating the ad ecosystem could be improving.</p> <p>Kelsey Chickering, analyst at Forrester, said that while Snapchat's “leading capabilities around AR are on trend with consumer shopping behaviours, the platform was never able to keep up with the addictive nature of TikTok”. </p> <p>“Snapchat's product improvements and their investment in a creator community never captured the same magic — sticky, endlessly entertaining, time consuming — that TikTok has mastered,” she added.</p> <p>Snap announced on Wednesday that Jerry Hunter, its head of engineering, would become chief operating officer. It also said Google's UK &amp; Ireland managing director Ronan Harris would be joining the company in October as its president of Europe, Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>But chief business officer Jeremi Gorman and Peter Naylor, vice-president of ad sales for the Americas, are leaving as part of the shake-up. Gorman said in a social media post that she and Naylor will be joining Netflix, where she will serve as the streaming site's president of worldwide advertising.</p> <p>Citi analyst Ron Josey said these moves “could prolong Snap's ad growth challenges and increase execution risk”, downgrading its recommendation on the stock to neutral from buy due to “continued monetisation headwinds and execution risk”.</p><p>Source: Hannah Murphy and Cristina Criddle in London 2022 'Snap to cut 20% of staff as it scales back ambitions' FT.com 31 August.
