  "text": "<p>At 6am on the day after my family moved to south London in 2014, we were wakened by ear-splitting shrieks. It sounded as if a coven of witches had landed their broomsticks in the tree outside our bedroom windows to conclude a doctrinal dispute.</p> <p>Blearily, I twitched the curtain aside. A flock of bright green parrots with red beaks and yellow tails perched in the branches. Some were hanging upside down.</p> <p>I have never taken LSD so this could not be an acid flashback. “Ring-necked parakeets,” I told my wife. She could not hear me. She had pulled the duvet over her ears to muffle the racket.</p> <p>Since then, the UK population of the ring-necked parakeet, endemic to parts of Africa and India, has exploded from the southern suburbs of the capital to number over 50,000. The birds have colonised Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. There are populations in Brussels, Hong Kong, and cities in Florida and the Middle East.</p> <p>UK media reports this month suggested the government was considering culling British parakeets. The story sounded tendentious to me. But I have grown to love these birds, so I am biased the other way.</p> <p>To begin with, I had grumbled angrily about “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/869c8c04-c184-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354\">invasive species</a>”. I changed my mind for a couple of reasons. First, the brilliant plumage and extrovert personality of this bird brightens the gloomiest day. We are having plenty of those. Parakeets don't care about coronavirus, the crisis in US democracy or Brexit. Like Peter Fonda in the teen rebel movie <em>Wild Angels</em>, they just want to have a good time.</p> <p>It cheers me to see them streaking overhead or descending on the garden bird feeder. They fly at two speeds: fast and faster. They brake hard before perching, executing a mid-air spread eagle that turns them into a sunburst when the light catches their feathers.</p> <p>Like most parrots, they are dexterous. Raiding fruit — unpalatable to humans — from the flowering cherry tree in a neighbouring garden, they hold each morsel delicately in one claw while picking at it. They use their beak as a third anchor point when climbing.</p> <p>I blame their tendency to tumble down chimneys on overconfidence. I imagine this was how a parakeet once ended up roosting on the picture rail of our dining room. A middle-aged business writer should not have to spend his evening pursuing a bird around his house with a butterfly net. It is undignified. Ornaments get broken. But these animals are acrobatic in the air, even indoors.</p> <p>A trail of airborne soot followed the parakeet, like pesticide behind a crop-dusting aircraft. It screamed from the moment it was caught to the moment I released it outside. I suspect none of these calls would have been printable in a family newspaper, if it were possible to translate them into English.</p> <p>I am not the only one who loves the parakeets. Walking in Hyde Park early in December, we encountered children feeding the resident flock birdseed from their hands. They were plainly thrilled by this encounter with wild creatures. One only hopes their parents made them wash their hands afterwards.</p> <p>The second reason for my parakeet revisionism is that dividing animals into “nice” endemic species and “nasty” introduced ones is pointless. The UK has hosted some non-native species for centuries, including fallow deer, rabbits and edible dormice. Some “native” species are reintroductions.</p> <p>The hallmark of the current Anthropocene epoch is that the environment is heavily influenced by human activity. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eeba4d8-b023-49e9-b319-ab0305922025\">Ring-necked parakeets</a> survive in northern European cities because people feed them and keep winter temperatures artificially high.</p> <p>It seems incongruous to object to foreign birds in London, a city where a significant minority of the current population was born overseas. According to one origin myth, the first pair of wild UK parakeets were pets released here in the 1960s by another flamboyant immigrant, the American rock musician Jimi Hendrix.</p> <p>The real question is whether the parakeets are doing any serious harm. “Evidence so far of their impact in the UK is anecdotal, localised and negligible,” says Dr Rachel White of Brighton University, who studies the birds. Dr Alex Bond of the Natural History Museum is not convinced. He says parakeets compete for nest holes with starlings and nuthatches.</p> <p>Many Londoners hate ring-necked parakeets because they scare away smaller birds and are so noisy. A breeding roost at the end of one's garden must be a nightmare. Fruit farmers naturally resent these avian scrumpers. The birds are an agricultural pest in rural India. When I lived there many years ago the attitude towards them, as towards other animals, was characteristically tolerant.</p> <p>“I'd shoot the lot of them,” says a colleague I'd normally regard as a gentle animal lover. Since the new year parakeet haters have needed a special licence to do this. Householders who boast of their air-gun marksmanship online may be breaking the law. They are also wasting their time. </p> <p>Without a general cull, such disreputable and cruel slayings create a vacant niche, swiftly filled by another parakeet. No general cull is likely. The Department of the Environment told me it is neither planning nor considering one.</p> <p>Fly high and free, freaky parakeets, as Jimi Hendrix might have put it. But if you could keep the noise down in the morning, everyone would be grateful.</p> <p><em>Jonathan Guthrie is head of Lex and an FT associate editor</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
