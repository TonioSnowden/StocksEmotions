  "title": "After Kansas Abortion Vote, Parties Weigh Lessons for Fall",
  "text": "<p>Some Republican analysts saw a flashing yellow warning sign for their party, which generally backs abortion restrictions, from the first statewide test of abortion sentiment since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. With voters agitated by inflation and unsatisfied with President Biden's job performance, most analysts say the election environment favors GOP candidates. But the high turnout for the referendum -- which drew about twice the number of votes as in the state's 2018 primaries -- suggested to some that the abortion fight could energize Democrats and sway independent voters who tend to favor fewer restrictions on the procedure.</p><p>\"I think this will alter traditional turnout models, mostly likely in the Democrats' favor,\" said John Truscott, who served as communications chief for former GOP Gov. John Engler in Michigan, where an abortion referendum is also likely to be on the ballot this fall. In some close races, he said, renewed attention to abortion could tip the balance toward Democrats.</p><p>The Supreme Court's ruling said the U.S. Constitution doesn't guarantee the right to an abortion and that states can determine its legal parameters. Since then, a number of states, especially in parts of the South and Midwest, have moved to ban or heavily restrict abortion, while others have looked to widen access or enshrine abortion in their constitutions. Abortion opponents said the result in Kansas was a significant defeat in their efforts to further limit it.</p><p>The Kansas amendment was rejected or received a mixed reception in several rural counties that had given Mr. Trump 60% and even 70% of their vote in 2020, suggesting that a substantial number of Republicans opposed the measure. Independents also turned out in large numbers, and about a fifth of those voting on the referendum -- more than 180,000 people -- didn't vote in the day's Republican or Democratic primaries for governor.</p><p>The results were parsed for their implications in states such as Michigan, one of the nation's most closely contested battlegrounds. A proposed constitutional amendment enshrining abortion rights is likely to be on the ballot there -- if approved by elections officials -- while voters are also choosing between Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who supports abortion rights, and her new Republican opponent, Tudor Dixon, who doesn't.</p><p>California and Vermont will vote on similar amendments in November. In Kentucky, which has enforced an abortion ban, voters will weigh an amendment stating there isn't a right to an abortion protected in the state's constitution.</p><p>Coming gubernatorial and legislative races in states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could determine the future of abortion access in those states. Abortion also could be an issue in U.S. House races in suburban districts, poised to be some of the most competitive in the country.</p><p>The Kansas results showed a wariness of changing abortion law but didn't test whether that will motivate voters to choose Democratic candidates, said nonpartisan pollster Bernie Porn, president of EPIC-MRA in Michigan. Still, the GOP \"may have miscalculated the intensity of the support for abortion rights, not only nationwide but in Republican areas,\" Mr. Porn said.</p><p>Others argued that it wasn't clear that abortion would weigh more heavily on voter decisions than other issues. \"I still think the biggest issue is going to be the economy,\" said Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.).</p><p>Still, many Democrats say the issue will play to their advantage in races.</p><p>\"If it's going to happen in Kansas, it's going to happen in a whole lot of states,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). \"The strong pro-choice turnout we saw last night in Kansas will continue well into the fall, and Republicans who side with these extremist MAGA policies that attack women's rights do so at their own political risk.\"</p><p>State election records show that women accounted for 70% of Kansans who registered to vote after the Supreme Court's abortion ruling, according to Tom Bonier, a Democratic voter-data analyst.</p><p>The referendum was soundly rejected in the state's suburban and metropolitan areas, losing by 16 percentage points in the Wichita area and by 36 points in the area around the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park.</p><p>Support for the amendment was stronger in the state's rural communities. Still, the results suggested that some Republicans opposed it. In Cowley County, on the southern border with Oklahoma, Mr. Trump drew 68% support in 2020, but voters there narrowly rejected the referendum on Tuesday, 52% to 48%.</p><p>Some Republican legislatures have been enacting laws that curb or ban abortion access, sometimes with an exception only if the patient's life is in danger. Political analysts said Tuesday's result in Kansas suggests voters may be wary of having such far-reaching laws in their state.</p><p>\"We've found that many voters who would define themselves as pro-life still embrace several exceptions,\" said Tony Fabrizio, lead pollster for Mr. Trump's two presidential campaigns. \"Conversely, many voters who would define themselves as pro-choice would embrace certain time limits.\"</p><p>Abortion opponents cautioned against reading too much into Tuesday night's results, which they said were influenced by millions of dollars that poured into the campaign from large donors and wall-to-wall media coverage of the abortion issue since the Supreme Court's decision.</p><p>At least $12 million in advertising poured in to sway voters, split roughly equally between supporters and opponents.</p><p>The Kansas vote could motivate abortion-rights supporters to try to take the issue to voters directly in more states in future years, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law.</p><p>\"It's going to make ballot initiatives seem like a promising tool for Democrats, and especially abortion-rights supporters, who are not sure how this is going to translate into Democratic victories at the polls,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Teresa Mettela contributed to this article.</p>",
