  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin is not used to receiving criticism from military commanders or visitors from friendly countries. So we can only imagine the discussion not going on for very long after <strong>Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer</strong>, a former officer himself, told his host about the war crimes Russian soldiers were committing in Ukraine. We'll bring you up to speed with what Austrian officials are saying about the visit and what the rationale was for Nehammer to go there in the first place.</p> <p>EU foreign affairs ministers who gathered in Luxembourg yesterday discussed (but didn't reach any conclusions on) a possible oil import ban as part of further sanctions against Russia. They also pledged more weapons and potentially <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56df1dc0-6cf3-41f8-a644-d44be5085ee8#post-6ca4a994-62a7-44e1-8024-a58e24854cfc\">another</a> €500mn towards arming Ukraine, especially as intelligence is mounting about a renewed Russian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/167c6cfb-44c3-41d4-b071-ea28ae520901\">offensive</a>. <strong>EU enlargement</strong> (and not just for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova) was also part of the ministers' talks, and I'll fill you in with what German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock had to say about not losing sight of the western Balkans.</p> <p>In hacking news, we'll explore what the European Commission had to say about reports that several of its officials last year were allegedly tapped with the <strong>spyware</strong> developed by Israel's NSO Group.</p> <h2>No big table</h2> <p>At least Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer didn't get the big table treatment, writes <em><strong>Sam Jones in Zurich.</strong></em></p> <p>After flying to Moscow yesterday to meet Vladimir Putin — in a unilateral diplomatic mission that raised eyebrows among European allies — Nehammer was subject to the usual litany of imagined historical grievances from Russia's belligerent president.</p> <p>The table at which the two leaders sat was of a normal size, said one Austrian member of the delegation — an allusion to the huge table in the Kremlin at which Putin has previously enjoyed humiliating foreign leaders, placing them symbolically metres away from him. &#xa0;</p> <p>But Nehammer had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c17a97f-a867-42ed-9e74-bef305e0b884\">hard words</a> of his own to deliver. The chancellor, a former military officer, told Putin that his soldiers were committing war crimes over which they would be called to account. He added that Russia had no way now of winning its war. And, he warned, sanctions would only become harsher, with the EU united over the need to keep pressure on the Kremlin.</p> <p>The meeting was held at the Novo-Ogaryovo presidential residence outside of Moscow. No photographs were taken at the Austrians' stipulation — aware of the possibility of Russia using the visit as a propaganda coup. </p> <p>In a sign of the cool political temperature in the room, the discussion between the two leaders was held through interpreters, even though Putin speaks fluent German. </p> <p>Given what both sides had to say, the chances of any kind of diplomatic breakthrough occurring were always slim to non-existent. In a statement following the talks, Nehammer said he left Moscow with “no positive impression”. Many European allies could be forgiven for now rounding on Austria in consternation, having repeatedly stressed the Kremlin's insincerity in recent weeks. </p> <p>But Austrian diplomats have told Europe Express they knew from the start that their chancellor's visit was unlikely to change much. All the same, they said, it was important for Putin to hear harsh criticisms — and the reality of his military failures — face to face, rather than down a phone line. At the very least, they reasoned, it was worth a shot, and Nehammer is probably the only leader in Europe — from a non-Nato country and with the political capital to spend — who could go to take it.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: Dipping oil</h1> <p><em>Oil prices extended a decline to fall below the $100 level it last touched almost four weeks ago, prompted by the war in Ukraine. Prices have declined over the past fortnight since the International Energy Agency pledged to release record amounts of oil from its reserves to help ease the energy crisis.

Now that Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia's EU membership bids are plugging along, (European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/news/statement-president-von-der-leyen-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-occasion-presidents-visit-kyiv-2022-04-08_en\">delivered</a> Ukraine's EU membership questionnaire when she visited Kyiv while Moldova and Georgia <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-223818\">received</a> theirs yesterday), Baerbock is sounding the alarm about decades-old promises made to Balkan countries. Each of them is at different stages along the EU accession path. </p> <p>“In these days, when Russia's war is not only directed against Ukraine, but also a war that is counting on Europe's divisions, it is incredibly important that we . . . keep our promises about EU membership for the western Balkans,” Baerbock told reporters in Luxembourg yesterday. </p> <p>“This is especially the case for Albania and North Macedonia. It is our responsibility to open accession negotiations in the first half of this year. It's a long overdue step,” she said.</p> <p>Albania and North Macedonia have been waiting for many years to start EU membership talks, the main obstacle being objections raised by Bulgaria about North Macedonia's history and language. (This comes after a decades-long naming dispute with Greece that was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d590913c-20a7-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65\">settled</a> in 2019.)</p> <p>Baerbock said she had spoken to her Bulgarian counterpart yesterday and that they “agreed that, especially in the current situation, it is crucial to start accession talks and I'm confident that Bulgaria can and will be able to iron out the outstanding issues”. </p> <p>Overall, Baerbock said the enlargement process towards the western Balkans should be accelerated, since most countries there in recent weeks had made their choice for EU membership clear and they were mostly supporting the EU's sanctions. </p> <p>She did note the one exception: Serbia (which has already opened EU membership talks). It has so far refused to adopt any of the bloc's Russia sanctions, keeping, for instance, its skies open to Russian planes.</p> <p>“If one wants to become a member of the EU, which Serbia does, then it's crucial to support EU foreign policy and its sanctions,” Baerbock said.</p> <h2>Are we being recorded?</h2> <p>Senior EU officials were reportedly the target of Israeli spy software last year, but the European Commission is insisting that it has robust safeguards in place, writes <em><strong>Javier Espinoza in Brussels.</strong></em><br><br>Didier Reynders, the EU's justice commissioner, and at least four other officials were reportedly targeted by Israeli <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c104369f-ec2a-446e-98aa-4c8749d973f4\">spyware</a> Pegasus although it was not immediately clear who was using the tool, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. It was also unclear whether the hack had been successful and what type of information the attackers had been able to extract from the Belgian official's phone.<br><br>Reuters also reported that a staffer at EU commissioner Vera Jourova's office was targeted.<br><br>The commission declined to comment on the matter. But an official told Europe Express that the commission “has at its disposal specialised services in charge of cyber security, forensic analysis and counter-intelligence, whose purpose is to safeguard the institution, its information and assets from the corresponding threat vectors”.<br><br>Officials in Brussels were reportedly aware of the actions after Apple issued messages to thousands of iPhone owners last year warning them they were “targeted by state-sponsored attackers”.<br><br>Still, EU officials insist their communications network is almost bulletproof. “It is now a common standard that we check everything is fine,” said one official. “We take a lot more care.”<br><br>NSO Group, the maker of Pegasus, has been in the spotlight before. A group of media outlets revealed last year that the software was being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5feb53-e7ff-47b3-ad42-93a8f2bc6aac\">used</a> on phones belonging to journalists and human rights activists.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>EU affairs ministers meet in Luxembourg, with the subjects including the rule of law in Hungary</p></li>  <li><p>World Trade Organization publishes its annual report for 2021</p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>On the campaign trail: </strong>President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7735ce5c-8d2a-4afb-a539-0899f54ce8b3\">has started</a> a frantic hunt for working-class votes across France in an attempt to ensure victory over his far-right rival Marine Le Pen.
