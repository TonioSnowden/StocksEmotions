  "text": "<p>\"Right now, there are loads of fears out there. It just takes a couple of positive developments and suddenly that picture changes,\" said Lewis Grant, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes.</p><p>Investors also got some relief on the energy front. Oil prices fell further from their recent highs after U.S. stockpiles grew more than expected, soothing some inflation concerns. European natural-gas prices slid after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Moscow was ready to work on stabilizing the global energy market.</p><p>Fresh figures showed that 326,000 Americans applied for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 2, down from 364,000 the week prior, further boosting investor sentiment.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied about 338 points, or 1%, to 34755. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite rose even higher as technology stocks recouped recent losses, lifting the benchmark up 1%.</p><p>Thursday's gains put stocks on firm footing for the week. All three major benchmarks are up at least 1.2% over the past four trading days. That marks a full recovery from Monday losses, when a selloff in Facebook stock and shares of other big technology companies rippled through the market.</p><p>\"A temporary deal should help reduce debt-ceiling related market volatility over the next few weeks as attention shifts toward December,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients.</p><p>On Thursday, technology and other growth stocks rallied. Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet rose more than 1%. Twitter rose even higher, adding nearly 5%. The company said Wednesday it would sell mobile ad firm MoPub to Applovin for $1.05 billion.</p><p>Cyclical stocks also moved higher, showing investors' willingness to snap up stocks at large. General Motors advanced 4.6%, while Ford Motor rose 5.4% .</p><p>Energy stocks also posted decent gains. Schlumberger rose 4%, while Marathon Oil added 2.1%.</p><p>Financial stocks rose 1%, and bond yields continued to creep up. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.570% Thursday from 1.524% a day earlier. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped 1.6%, with gains led by the basic resources and auto sectors.</p><p>Indexes in Asia also closed higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 3.1%, led by gains in technology companies. Shares of Chinese Estates (Holdings) rose 32% in Hong Kong on Thursday after its majority shareholders offered to take the company private. The group is a major shareholder of embattled property giant China Evergrande Group.</p><p>South Korea's Kospi rallied 1.8%. The Nikkei 225 added 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Michael Wursthorn at michael.wursthorn@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks End Higher After Debt-Limit Extension Deal</p>",
