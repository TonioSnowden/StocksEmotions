  "title": "Stocks Rally as Year-End Approaches; Trading is light in the final days of the year, potentially enabling outsize market moves",
  "text": "<p>The gains stretched across industries Thursday, with all 11 of the S&amp;P 500's sectors advancing for the day. Tech stocks were among the best performers, with some recent stock-market losers outperforming the broader market.</p><p>Tesla shares, for example, shot up $9.11, or 8.1%, to $121.82. They remain down 65% for the year. Shares of Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which are headed for one of their worst years on record, also outperformed the broader market, adding at least 2.8% each.</p><p>With just one trading session left in 2022, many investors are likely to end the year nursing heavy losses. As of Thursday, the Dow industrials, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 8.6%, 19% and 33%, respectively, this year.</p><p>\"Investors desperately want to end the year on a bullish note, but I think that is pretty offsides with the facts,\" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company.</p><p>Mr. Olsen said he is cautious heading into the new year, wary that higher interest rates could weigh on stock returns in the coming months.</p><p>In the last days of the year, investors are considering what China's shift away from a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 means for markets. On one hand, the resumption of travel in and out of China could add a boost to the global economy as growth slows.</p><p>On the other, investors worry that rising demand could boost prices for energy and other commodities, propelling central bankers to raise interest rates further to curb inflation. The spread of Covid-19 in the country could also curb production, disrupting supply chains.</p><p>\"This is why we have this hot and cold market reaction,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.</p><p>Thursday's stock-market jump builds upon the most volatile year for the S&amp;P 500 since the 2008 financial crisis. The broad stock-market gauge has recorded 122 daily moves of 1% or more, the most in 14 years.</p><p>The end of year also brings a sense of déjà vu. The U.S. is concerned that the rapid spread in China of the virus that causes Covid-19 could increase the potential for new variants. Federal officials said the U.S. will require travelers from China to submit a negative Covid-19 test beginning Jan. 5.</p><p>Many traders are off this week. That means markets are susceptible to outsize moves from fewer trades, heightening volatility.</p><p>Peter van Dooijeweert, head of multiasset solutions at Man Solutions, said investors appear reluctant to take big risks in the market heading into the new year.</p><p>\"Most people expect the first quarter to be very difficult,\" Mr. van Dooijeweert said. \"We're going to be stuck on every data point.\"</p><p>Fresh data on inflation and jobs has stoked fireworks in the stock market throughout 2022, a trend Mr. van Dooijeweert said he expects to persist in the new year.</p><p>In the latest read on the health of the U.S. economy, figures released Thursday showed the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits in the week ended Dec. 24 stood at 225,000, up slightly from 216,000 the week prior.</p><p>For the most part, the long-awaited \"Santa Claus Rally\" hasn't yet arrived, with the S&amp;P 500 on track for a 0.1% rise this week after some large swings. U.S. stocks tend to rise during the Santa Claus rally period—the last five trading sessions of the year and first two of the new year.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 1.2% to $82.26 a barrel.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 3.833% from 3.886% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell. The greenback is set for its biggest yearly rise since 2014, but investors are optimistic that the dollar's strength has now run its course.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.7%. Major indexes in Asia closed with losses. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.9%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8%, and China's Shanghai Composite edged down 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com.</p><p>Stocks Rally as Year-End Approaches</p>",
