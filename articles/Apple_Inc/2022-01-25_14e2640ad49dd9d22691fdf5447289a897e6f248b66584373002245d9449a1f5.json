  "text": "<p>Mr. Young wasn't immediately available for comment.</p><p>The letter came in response to The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which is currently Spotify's most popular podcast, and also tops Apple's podcasting charts. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotify, reportedly worth more than $100 million.</p><p>\"With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world's largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy,\" Mr. Young wrote in the letter. \"I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform…They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.\"</p><p>Spotify didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Spotify's bet on Mr. Rogan's show has caused trouble in the past for the audiostreaming company. Some employees expressed concern over the podcast's content during a town-hall meeting in September, relating to material they felt was anti-transgender, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Earlier this month a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter to Spotify accusing the podcast of \"promoting baseless conspiracy theories\" and asking the service to take action against mass-misinformation events on its platform.</p><p>\"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,\" it said.</p><p>Write to Gareth Vipers at gareth.vipers@wsj.com</p><p>Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music Over Joe Rogan's Vaccine Comments</p>",
