  "title": "Move over, TikTok: Social media has 'a new king in town' in BeReal; BeReal is the leading app by iOS downloads so far this quarter in the U.S.",
  "text": "<p>Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik noted that trends are admittedly different when you look globally, or beyond Apple Inc. AAPL devices running the iOS operating system. Instagram tops the charts on a pure global basis, and BeReal doesn't even crack the top five. When you look at global iOS downloads, to account for the fact that Alphabet Inc.-developed GOOG GOOGL apps come preinstalled on Android devices, Instagram still ranks first, with YouTube second and BeReal third.</p><p>\"But if US iOS downloads represent the bleeding edge of innovation, there's a new king in town,\" he said in a note to clients.</p><p>While apps like Meta Platforms Inc.'s META Instagram encourage users to post curated photos and videos to their feeds, social-media users also have an appreciation for apps like Snap Inc.'s SNAP Snapchat, through which people share photos of themselves making funny faces and using cheesy filters.</p><p>BeReal aims to capitalize on that more spontaneous aspect of social media as well, though the company says on its iOS app-download page that it's \"not another social network.\"</p><p>The app notifies people once a day at a different time that they have two minutes to share a selfie and a shot of their surroundings. The app is a \"new and unique way to discover who your friends really are in their daily life,\" BeReal says on its website.</p><p>Shmulik noted that \"the company's pitch seems to be resonating,\" both in terms of app downloads and the attention BeReal is getting from established social-media players.</p><p>TikTok recently launched TikTok Now, its own take on the trend, which the company said it would build into the app for U.S. users and offer as a standalone app in some other regions. TechCrunch reported this summer that Instagram \"quietly added\" a feature called Dual to its Reels platform, allowing people to capture footage with their front- and back-facing cameras simultaneously.</p><p>Whether the TikTok clone in particular takes off is still an unknown, according to Shmulik. \"Such ventures can be a hit or miss, as Meta very well knows, but the competition for eyeballs is stronger than ever,\" he wrote.</p><p>Move over, TikTok: Social media has 'a new king in town' in BeReal</p>",
