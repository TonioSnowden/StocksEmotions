Take our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/234ce950-0d47-4f54-9faa-453883a13375\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Investors are braced for more losses on Wall Street today after a vicious sell-off wiped out the gains of a relief rally and dragged down many leading technology stocks.</p> <p>Shares in Asia and Europe have today <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5766cdb7-7399-4552-9884-d3fd3339fb0d\">followed US equities lower</a> at the end of a week that saw the US Federal Reserve raise its main interest rate by half a percentage point for the first time since 2000 and indicate it would tighten its monetary policy further at meetings in June and July. </p> <p>Comments from Fed chair Jay Powell after the announcement on Wednesday initially provided some solace for investors who feared a steeper rise in the interest rate to suppress surging US inflation. </p> <p>But yesterday gravity appeared to take hold of the US stock markets' elevated valuations and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ba254c-74e3-4e33-903d-98813264ed4c\">its biggest one-day decline since June 2020</a>. </p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index also declined significantly, sliding 3.5 per cent with more than 95 per cent of the stocks in the benchmark ending lower. </p> <p>The severity of the sell-off stunned investors. Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings, described the fall as a “capitulation trade”. Danny Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler, said there was “nowhere to hide” for investors after the biggest sell-off since the start of the pandemic. </p> <p>Shares of some of corporate America's biggest names lurched lower, with Amazon down 7.6 per cent, Tesla sinking 8.3 per cent and Apple sliding 5.6 per cent.</p> <p>The sell-off spilled over into the fixed income market, with yields on 10-year US government bonds rising back above 3 per cent as buyers sought inflation protection in commodities. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> My colleague Robert Armstrong has more on what he calls <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4eed5127-d0b7-47ad-8a29-939fd80d3144\">“a stomach-churning few days”</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks to all our readers who voted in yesterday's poll.

In July 2021, Vladimir Putin, in his own wannabe professor mode, published a lengthy screed, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, which manages to be stupefyingly dull while also exhaustively untrue.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper: </strong>For more than a decade, Ukraine's government and financial system and other key infrastructure were pummelled by Russian state-backed hackers. Now, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3391bf8c-e431-415c-b7c5-9eeee08b3374\">hordes of pro-Ukrainian hackers</a> are matching Russian cyber aggression. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Musk taps wealthy friends and true believers to back his Twitter deal</strong> Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, crypto exchange Binance and asset management groups Fidelity, Brookfield and Sequoia Capital are among 19 investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b53cfeb-f886-4b66-9bd9-75801816e71e\">who have stumped up more than $7bn of funding</a> for Elon Musk's $44bn buyout of Twitter, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p><strong>Fake meat start-ups go to court </strong>Executives in the food industry are closely watching a patent dispute between Impossible Foods, one of the earliest plant-based meat producers, and Motif FoodWorks. The dispute <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43912436-e579-4756-9795-b78fb4457c7a\">centres on a protein molecule</a> designed to make plant products taste like beef burgers. </p> <p><strong>Nasa tackles asteroid strikes</strong> The existential threat from asteroids and comets, portrayed in films such as <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Don't Look Up</em>, has been known since scientists showed in the 1980s that an impact 65mn years ago wiped out the dinosaurs.

Here are some extracts from what you have been saying:</p> <blockquote>  <p>That decision replaced the will of the people (voters) with that of the Supreme Court and cut off therapeutic debate. By design, the states are the incubators of the public will. Roe unsuccessfully attempted to terminate that process by terminating lawful debate. Reversal will allow the debate to work its way throughout the nation, state by state — H. R. Piet, Lewes, Delaware, US.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>[The Roe vs Wade ruling] has been highly destructive of the Supreme Court nomination process, essentially dumbing it down to scare tactics from both sides — Simon Noble, Madrid, Spain.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>[Roe vs Wade] should absolutely not be overturned. As a German woman in the US this idea totally scares me and makes me feel back in the 1960s — Elisabeth Bluethner, Sammamish, Washington.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Thank you for all your emails.
