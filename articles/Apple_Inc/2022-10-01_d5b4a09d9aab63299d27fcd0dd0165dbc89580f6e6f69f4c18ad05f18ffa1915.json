  "text": "<p>\n  I don't know about you, but I always exit summer feeling a little pickled. I've overindulged: booze, sun, late nights, parties, the usual suspects. I'm happy for routine to return. October is this lovely pause before the holiday partying begins. </p><p>\n  I choose the word pause carefully, because as my mom often reminds me, as a kid, I never wanted to leave the party. Not much has changed. I'm often awarded MVP. So, although I might not be hosting or attending much this month, I'm always planning the next bash. For instance, I know this killer roasted carrot recipe is going to be part of my Thanksgiving menu. And if you're having friends over on the weekend, this is a crowd-pleasing, easy-on-the-host dish for any fall dinner party. </p><p>\n  As I rein it in, root vegetables start making their seasonal debut in my shopping cart. I tend to begin roasting again and making more veg-forward meals. Try to get your hands on carrots with their tops, so you can use the leaves like you would any soft herb. If you can't find them, just throw in more flat-leaf parsley. No need to peel the carrots; instead give them a spa treatment and scrub them in cool water. </p><p>\n  Why not give this a spin and lock it in for turkey day? In the meantime, enjoy wearing a sweater again, reach for the apple cider doughnuts near the grocery checkout and watch \"The Last Movie Stars,\" about Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman -- a documentary series made to hunker down with, under a blanket. </p><p>\n  Enjoy the reboot, because next month, we're on! </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Roasted Carrots With Pancetta, Hazelnuts and Parmigiano </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  If you're vegetarian, simply omit the pancetta. The recipe has plenty of big flavors coming from hazelnuts, garlic, Parmigiano and red-wine vinegar. This pairs happily with roast chicken, creamy polenta or couscous with feta. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Total Time: 45 minutes </p><p>\n  Serves: 4-6 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1 1/2 pounds medium carrots (preferably with their tops) </p><p>\n  1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </p><p>\n  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </p><p>\n  Freshly ground black pepper </p><p>\n  4 tablespoons unsalted butter </p><p>\n  4 ounces pancetta, finely diced </p><p>\n  1 shallot, finely diced </p><p>\n  1/2 cup hazelnuts, roughly chopped </p><p>\n  2 cloves garlic, finely grated </p><p>\n  2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar </p><p>\n  1/2 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish </p><p>\n  Finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, to serve </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. If carrots have tops, remove about an inch from root, and set aside. Scrub carrots and halve lengthwise. Place carrots on a parchment-lined baking sheet or roasting pan, toss in oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven, turning occasionally, until soft and browned, 30-35 minutes. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter, and saute pancetta and shallots, 5-7 minutes. Add hazelnuts and garlic and continue to saute until buttery and golden, a few minutes more. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  3. Remove carrots from oven, let cool slightly, then add vinegar, pancetta-hazelnut mixture, parsley, a handful of leafy carrot tops, if you have them, and toss to combine. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  4. Serve in roasting pan or on a platter. Top generously with Parmigiano, some more carrot tops or parsley, and cranks of black pepper. </p><p></p>",
