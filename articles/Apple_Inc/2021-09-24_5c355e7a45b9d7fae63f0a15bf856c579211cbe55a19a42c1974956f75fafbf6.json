  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>Last night there was finally some excitement in the <strong>German election</strong> campaign. All it took was for smaller parties to be represented in the <em>Schlussrunde, </em>the last televised debate before the Sunday election. Unlike in previous debates, this time around, moderators asked about Europe, the US, China, Russian gas and even the French flare-up over the Aukus deal. I'll give you a rundown on how the candidates positioned themselves on these topics.</p> <p>Speaking of Aukus, last night we saw an end to the stand-off over next week's EU-US meeting in Pittsburgh, which France had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b336fac8-ce36-44b8-8a30-022c5d20a926\">demanded</a> to be postponed. Officials familiar with the discussions say Paris backed down after the US side said no time slots were available in October — it was either next week or not at all.</p> <p>Another lonely fight for France is over its request for <strong>expanded jurisdiction</strong> when it comes to tech companies — in preliminary discussions over draft regulation which has yet to be agreed among EU governments.</p> <p>We also have a dispatch from Italy, looking at how European companies fare when it comes to <strong>money laundering</strong> and dealing with people on international sanctions lists.</p> <h2>Seven world views</h2> <p>Seven politicians, two moderators, and finally some questions that went beyond rent controls and Germany's sacrosanct debt brake (though these issues featured too). </p> <p>Disagreements on energy policy (Russian gas, in particular) and China flared up between the Greens and the CSU, the Bavarian sister party of chancellor candidate Armin Laschet — which could become coalition partners. </p> <p>Fringe views on climate change and leaving Nato were also represented, though they came from leaders of parties on the far right and far left who have minimal chances to be part of the next coalition.</p> <p>Here is a rundown on the main issues:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>On Europe,</strong> the five candidates whose parties have a shot at forming a government stuck to pro-EU slogans: More Europe, a stronger Europe, a more sovereign Europe, particularly regarding the US-China rivalry. The CDU's Laschet said the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan proves Europe needs to start spending on common defence projects “so we can act when the US is withdrawing”. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>On Aukus,</strong> SPD frontrunner Olaf Scholz said he can understand France's irritation, adding that this was the position of the entire German government (a nod at the fact that he is the only candidate to have served in a government with Angela Merkel). But he also struck a more pro-US tone than Laschet, saying that Europe needs to co-operate with the US, “especially when it is as critical as now”.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>On China,</strong> the most hawkish voices came from the Greens' Annalena Baerbock and centrist Free Democratic party leader Christian Lindner — who may both end up in a cabinet led by either Scholz or Laschet. Baerbock went on the offensive on how tone deaf the Merkel government was last December when it forced through a draft EU investment deal with Beijing, even as the new Biden administration had expressed concerns about it. A far more China-friendly stance came from Markus Söder of the CSU, who is concerned about Bavarian companies active in China. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>On Nord Stream,</strong> Baerbock and Laschet crossed swords — and not for the first time. Laschet said that “if we get out of all energy sources, we need gas over the next few years”, and seemed convinced that a “geopolitical guarantee” for Ukraine would suffice for Russia not to mess with its neighbour. </p></li> </ul> <p>With latest polls (here is our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5885e964-6d54-46ba-be63-8fb7009075f2\">up-to-date tracker</a>) indicating only a four percentage points advantage for the SPD and with none of the parties estimated to come in above 30 per cent, a three-way coalition is the most likely outcome. In which case, all these clashing positions would have to come to a common denominator. </p> <p>Who are you betting on in Sunday's election? <a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times_europe_express/who-do-you-think-will-become-the-next-ge\">Click here</a> to take the poll. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: Election uncertainty </h1> <p><em>Inflation expectations derived from German inflation-protected government bonds — known as breakevens — have increased sharply, hitting their highest level since 2013. This trend has outpaced other big markets such as the US, suggesting that the upcoming election has injected uncertainty into a typically staid market. (</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95a35612-4796-427c-950b-c54bcc0ba134\"><em>More here</em></a><em>)</em></p> <h2>Battle for control</h2> <p>The EU's new set of rules on how to police Big Tech is pitting countries against each other as they joust over which regulators wield most power, writes <em><strong>Javier Espinoza</strong></em> in Brussels. </p> <p>France wants its regulators to be able to go after businesses even if they are based in another country. Meanwhile, Ireland and Luxembourg, where most of the large tech groups have based their European operations, want to keep the status quo, in which only regulators in the country where the headquarters are based have jurisdiction over those companies.</p> <p>Brussels <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb681171-3673-46e5-a243-9c18d97e22d5\">last year</a> put forward draft legislation updating its dusty digital rules which go back 20 years, when there were no social media platforms and Google was in its infancy. </p> <p>The European parliament, the commission and EU states still need to start negotiations on those proposals — and a first step would be for governments to agree on a common position before that ‘trilogue' can start. </p> <p>France's request veers off the commission's proposal, which kept the ‘country of origin principle', meaning regulators in Ireland and Luxembourg would mainly be responsible for forcing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to take down illegal content or face fines.</p> <p>Under the current proposal, national regulators in France could impose fines for the country-specific content on Facebook or Google, but they cannot ask for takedowns elsewhere.</p> <p>Political pressure has grown recently after a terrorist attack in France that resulted in the beheading of a teacher sparked calls for tough regulation of social media. The Elysée wants each country in the bloc to have the same powers Ireland and Luxembourg have. </p> <p>Ireland in particular has been criticised for its weak pursuit of tech companies. Activists and member states worry, for example, that Ireland has most privacy complaints against large online platforms still unresolved.</p> <p>In a joint paper cosigned with Luxembourg and seen by Europe Express, the Irish government defended the country-of-origin principle as “fundamental in providing businesses with the necessary legal certainty”.</p> <p>The paper warns that what Paris is pushing for risks “eroding” a system which in their view works well.</p> <p>The letter adds: “The country of establishment is best placed to exercise effective jurisdiction and take corrective measures against a service provider, while accommodating the co-operation with and assistance to authorities from other member states.”</p> <p>Ultimately, diplomatic sources warned, the French demands may backfire, delaying the adoption of the new rules beyond the first half of 2022, when Paris will hold the rotating presidency of the EU (tech regulation being one of their priorities).</p> <h2>Shirking sanctions</h2> <p>Does Europe have a corporate transparency problem? It certainly does, according to a<a href=\"https://www.transcrime.it/en/publications/datacros/\"> vast new study</a> of 56 million companies across the 27 EU member states by Transcrime, a research group at Italy's Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, writes <em><strong>Miles Johnson</strong></em> in Rome.</p> <p>The report, partly funded by the EU, found that on average 1 per cent of companies in the bloc have shareholder ties with countries that are included on the EU's own anti-money laundering black or grey lists. </p> <p>Among the countries in question are Panama, Seychelles and the US Virgin Islands. </p> <p>Transcrime's research also discovered that more than 55,000 companies across eight EU countries (Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands) are linked to or controlled by people included in global sanctions lists issued by the EU, US and Bank of England.</p> <p>In addition, an average 1.2 per cent of all EU companies are controlled by a trust, fiduciary or foundation that does not allow the public to know who is the beneficial owner.</p> <p>Why does it matter for Europe? </p> <p>“There is an extensive body of evidence suggesting that legitimate companies play a crucial role in terms of facilitating corruption schemes and money laundering of illicit proceeds.” In other words, crimes are almost certainly being facilitated by poor levels of corporate transparency in certain EU member states.</p> <p>As the continent gears up to start spending the vast sums from the EU Covid-19 recovery fund, the ability for governments to know exactly where this money is going will be more important than ever.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>EU consumer protection ministers meet in Slovenia</p></li>  <li><p>The Conference on the Future of Europe holds its second citizen panel in Strasbourg, this time focusing on democracy and rule of law </p></li> </ol> <h1>Smart reads </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tax holdouts: </strong>The US is in danger of misreading Europe's support for the recent global corporate tax agreement, writes the German Council on Foreign Relations in this <a href=\"https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/international-corporate-tax-reform\">policy brief</a>. While the French and German finance ministers and leaders of the European Institutions smooth things over with warm words, the EU is not in fact united on this issue and remains fearful of exposing internal rifts on the international stage. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cold War 2.0:</strong> The European Council on Foreign Relations <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/what-europeans-think-about-the-us-china-cold-war/\">has surveyed</a> respondents in 12 EU countries who believe the cold war is back, both between the US and Russia, but also between the US and China — and what that means for the EU's ‘strategic autonomy'. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Post-Brexit roaming:</strong> With the end of free roaming charges after Brexit, the cost of phone bills when travelling in Europe is only going to increase for UK consumers, writes the Centre for European Reform in this <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/leave-your-phone-home\">policy brief</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Recommended newsletters for you </h1><p>Source: Valentina Pop 2021 'Sparks fly in last German debate before election' FT.com 24 September.
