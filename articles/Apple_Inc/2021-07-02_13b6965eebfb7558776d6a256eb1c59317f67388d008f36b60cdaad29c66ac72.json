  "text": "<p>\n  Mr. Burkle owns two California homes formerly owned by comedian Bob Hope and his wife Dolores Hope. </p><p>\n  In Palm Springs, Mr. Burkle recently completed a major restoration of the Hopes' weekend house. Designed by architect John Lautner, the roughly 24,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom home looks like a spaceship -- its circular structure has a 60-foot-diameter oculus at its center -- and is a local landmark. When shown the model, Mr. Hope quipped \"Well, at least when they come down from Mars they'll know where to go.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Burkle said he remembers reading about the house when he was a teenager. \"I loved Bob Hope. I mean, everybody did. I remember thinking he's building a house bigger than the grocery store I work in,\" he said. \"Not only could I never imagine I would own it, I never imagined I'd enjoy it because I thought somebody would be crazy to build a house that big.\" The house was originally listed by the Hopes' children in 2013 for $50 million; Mr. Burkle paid $13 million in 2016. \"I said to them, 'I don't want to hurt your feelings and I have huge respect for your father,'\" but the house was not worth that much. The house was a subject of debate in the architectural community. The design of the interior didn't reflect Mr. Lautner's original vision for the project. Dolores Hope hired a designer to make her own changes and added features like swan faucets and colorful wallpaper. </p><p>\n  Following the purchase, Mr. Burkle employed Lautner protege Helena Arahuete, who worked on the original design, to return it to the original vision. \"I said to her, 'You get your way on everything,'\" Mr. Burkle said. The only exception: the pool, which Mr. Burkle insisted should be enlarged significantly and shaped to reflect the curvature of the house. </p><p>\n  In 2018, Mr. Burkle paid $15 million for the Hopes' longtime primary home in the Los Angeles area of Toluca Lake and recently completed a renovation. Originally built in English Traditional style but later partially remodeled with a more contemporary look by architect John Elgin Woolf around 1960, it sits on more than 5 acres and has almost 15,000 square feet plus a guesthouse, a gym and separate office quarters. It still contains the original vault Mr. Hope used to store his decades of jokes. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Neverland </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Mr. Burkle and Mr. Jackson, Neverland's original owner, had a history. Mr. Burkle said he visited the ranch in the mid-2000s as part of a program for disadvantaged children and hit it off with Mr. Jackson. He said the pop star called him the next day to say that he liked him and that, from now on, he would buy all his groceries at Mr. Burkle's stores. Mr. Burkle served as an adviser to the singer on business matters, when the pop star was working to stave off financial disaster brought on in part by his lavish lifestyle, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>\n  Mr. Burkle said their relationship had little to do with the purchase. As an owner of the private club brand Soho House, Mr. Burkle had been looking at the property next door for a potential new club and had grown curious about the ranch. The train tracks were still there, but the train no longer ran. The zoo enclosures were empty. The Ferris wheel had been disassembled. </p><p>\n  The child-molestation accusations that tarnished Mr. Jackson's reputation in later years also weren't a factor. \"Michael Jackson hasn't lived there in over 15 years,\" Mr. Burkle said, adding that he had fallen in love with the land and purchased the ranch from his friend Tom Barrack, an investor who heads Colony Capital, which co-owned the property with the Jackson estate after Mr. Jackson defaulted on a loan. </p><p>\n  Ongoing construction at the ranch has fed speculation about whether Mr. Burkle may be interested in turning Neverland into a Soho House. (Most who enter are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement.) </p><p>\n  Mr. Burkle said that isn't the case. He said his team is working on restoring parts of the ranch that were falling apart from neglect, such as replacing pipes. The train station, modeled after one at Disneyland, and which had been damaged by woodpeckers, is being restored, as is the Neverland flower clock. Many of the roads have also been upgraded. Mr. Burkle said he hopes that one day one of the trains may run again. </p><p>\n  The property also includes a 12,000-square-foot Normandy-style mansion, guesthouses, a swimming pool with a cabana, a basketball court, a tennis court and a 50-seat movie theater. </p><p>\n  Mr. Burkle maintains that he has few grand plans beyond restoring the property and describes the deal as a land grab. \"It's just not a bad thing to have your money tied up in,\" he says. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Yucaipa, Calif. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In Yucaipa, the city for which his investment company is named, Mr. Burkle still owns the first house he ever bought in the 1980s for $750,000. </p><p>\n  The estate comprises roughly 500 acres. Mr. Burkle said the home sits on a hill overlooking local apple orchards and has a teak interior. It still has an original air-conditioning system, which works off a motor. Mr. Burkle refuses to replace it. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  London </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In London, Mr. Burkle said he has a home at one of his private clubs, the Ned, located in a 1920s-era building close to St Paul's Cathedral that was formerly the headquarters of Midland Bank. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Los Felix, Calif. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Mr. Burkle recently sold the Ennis House in Los Feliz for $18 million following an ultra-pricey restoration project. He bought it for roughly $4.5 million in 2011. Mr. Burkle said he viewed the project as saving the house. The circa-1920s landmark home was designed to look like a Mayan temple and is constructed from roughly 27,000 concrete blocks. </p><p>\n  Mr. Burkle insisted on interviewing prospective buyers personally. After all the work he had put in, he said he wanted to sell to someone with an interest in continuing to invest in keeping the house in good condition. </p><p></p>",
