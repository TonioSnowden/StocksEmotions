  "title": "Technology:  Apple, Major League Soccer Strike Streaming Deal  ----  By Rachel Bachman and Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. and Major League Soccer signed a deal worth at least $2.5 billion to broadcast games on the tech giant's streaming service, the iPhone maker's most significant move yet into sports that underscores its growing ambitions for streaming. </p><p>   The 10-year agreement announced Tuesday will make the Apple TV app the home of all MLS matches, available to fans through a variety of programming options. </p><p>   While financial terms for the deal weren't disclosed, the agreement is worth a minimum of $250 million a year, according to a person familiar with details. </p><p>   The agreement makes MLS the most significant American sports league to move all of its games to a streaming service, rather than the bulk of games appearing on cable or broadcast TV. From early 2023 through 2032, fans will access matches by subscribing to a new MLS streaming service available only through the Apple TV app. The price for the service wasn't disclosed. </p><p>   A broad selection of matches in MLS and Leagues Cup, an annual competition between MLS and Liga MX clubs, will be available to subscribers to Apple TV+, a premium service for which Apple charges a $4.99 monthly fee. A limited number of matches will be available free on Apple TV, which can be accessed by anyone with internet access. The deal encompasses global broadcast rights, an unusual step. Sports leagues typically sell the broadcast or streaming rights to their games by country or region. </p><p>   Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, said the global aspect of the deal was attractive to the company. </p><p>   The deal for live soccer games is the latest trophy to be acquired in a fight among the likes of Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Walt Disney Co., and others for new programming to fill their streaming services and to attract users with buzzy content. </p><p>   Increasingly, sports content appears to be a key strategy for many services to bolster content. Sports leagues are embracing the battle for online viewership -- and the potential for capturing younger fans -- while traditional TV viewership has struggled. </p><p>   Despite the entire MLS schedule being available via Apple under the agreement, the league also will pursue linear-TV deals to simulcast a limited number of games, a move Mr. Cue said Apple supports. \"In general, we're interested in growing the game, first and foremost,\" he said. \"And to the extent that others can grow the game, we're very interested.\" </p><p>   Amazon and the National Football League last year struck a multiyear deal to stream 15 games a season on Amazon's Prime Video platform. The NFL later announced Amazon would take over the exclusive rights for \"Thursday Night Football\" a year earlier beginning in 2022. </p><p>   Apple TV+, launched in 2019, has taken a different approach to building out its streaming service than others, such as Netflix and Disney+, which have deep catalogs of content and have spent big to create more. Instead, Apple has pursued a niche strategy, aiming to pick quality content, including the Emmy-winning series \"Ted Lasso\" and the movie \"CODA,\" which marked the first time a streaming service won best picture at the Academy Awards this year. </p><p>   Part of that evolving approach for Apple seems to include adding sports. In March, Apple announced a deal to broadcast two Major League Baseball games on Friday nights. The effort, dubbed \"Friday Night Baseball,\" includes pregame and postgame shows. </p><p>   Streaming makes up a small part of Apple's overall business where about half of its revenue comes from the sale of iPhones. </p><p>   Apple doesn't break out results of the streaming service. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Bernstein, has estimated revenue from Apple's streaming service doubled to $2.2 billion in the past fiscal year compared with a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
