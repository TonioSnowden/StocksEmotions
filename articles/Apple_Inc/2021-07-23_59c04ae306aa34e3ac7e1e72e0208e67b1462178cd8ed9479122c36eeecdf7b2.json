  "text": "<p>Once upon a time, users of credit cards were required by many traders to pay a premium compared with those who paid by cash (“Apple and Klarna are cutting up credit cards”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aac740a4-106f-4bbf-b9ce-19af2a74055a\">Opinion</a>, FT Weekend, July 17). In their wisdom, legislators decided to make this practice illegal. The buy now, pay later business model relies on retailers subsidising the credit costs in the hopes that customers are encouraged to buy more. This is perhaps less of an issue when interest rates are so low, but those who pay cash must be subsidising those who use BNPL to facilitate their purchase.</p> <p>The system continues to encourage the consumer to buy on credit whatever the fancy new name it may trade under. Those who use credit should pay extra and those who pay “cash” should not be providing an implicit subsidy. </p> <p><strong>Matthew Dobbs</strong> <br><em>London W11, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Cash payers should not have to subsidise cards ' FT.com 23 July.
