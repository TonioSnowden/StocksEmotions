  "text": "<p>Thirty years ago, long before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be94a894-f7c1-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71\">Jikoni</a> was a twinkle in my eye, Marylebone was a very different neighbourhood. There was The Conran Shop and La Fromagerie — the village's beloved grocery store — and little in between. Patricia, La Fromagerie's owner, has been a permanent fixture. Her restless spirit and impeccable taste has meant her shop has endured and thrived. </p> <p>I like to go there to drink coffee, to brood in the cheese room or caress the heirloom vegetables. It is a temple of culinary worship and the heart of the community. Patricia, who knows each of her few hundred suppliers personally, can regale you with tales of the Italian farmer who sings opera to his vines or the Corsican couple who are so devoted to their multitude of citrus trees that the memory of the knot and crevice of every branch is committed to their fingertips. </p> <p>In autumn the shop resembles a Caravaggio still life. There are apples and pears with rotund freckled bodies, and quinces with perfect voluptuous undulation, fragranced like the warmth of a woman's body. </p> <p>My fingers linger on the blackberries. I buy a handful to taste. I am stunned by their gutsiness, their sheer, sour voltage, a ferocity that tastes of somewhere remote and otherworldly. They stain my mouth and the cuff of my trenchcoat. </p> <p>I buy half a dozen sticky, yielding figs and clusters of grapes, most of which will be eaten&#xa0;on&#xa0;the slow journey home. I can never resist&#xa0;the pomegranates, their leathery skin blushing, censoring the ravishing, bejewelled contents within. </p> <p>My shopping tote is heavy. I have been reckless, as usual, but I am grateful to be the custodian of autumn's ripest bounty. I will cook the fruits with aromatic spices to bring an ambrosial richness to sweet puddings as well as salads and stews. I cross the road to the restaurant, distracted by so many hypothetical recipes. </p>  <h2>Roasted grapes, ﬁgs and pomegranate with burrata and bitter leaves</h2> <p>Serves six</p> <ol>  <li><p>Preheat the oven to 180C</p></li>  <li><p>Cut the vines of the grapes with scissors, making sure you still leave them in fairly large bunches. In a bowl, whisk together the pomegranate molasses, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Season with sea salt and pepper and then drizzle half over the grapes, tossing gently to make sure they are well coated. Scatter over the pink peppercorns and thyme. Roast in oven for 10-12 minutes, turning halfway through, until the grapes are starting to burst and split. Set aside to cool slightly.</p></li>  <li><p>Meanwhile, arrange the chicory over a serving platter and lay the warm grapes, figs and torn burrata on top. Scrape the juices from the roasting pan into the remaining marinade and mix, then drizzle over the salad. Scatter over the walnuts and pomegranate seeds and serve.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Fragrant lamb pilaf with quince and golden almonds</h2> <p>Serves four </p> <p><strong>To serve</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Peel and halve the quinces, squeeze lemon juice over and rub into flesh, then steam over a saucepan of simmering water for 20 minutes or until just tender. Set aside until cool, then cut into wedges.</p></li>  <li><p>Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a casserole pan over a medium high heat and brown the lamb pieces all over. Remove the lamb from the pan and set aside. Add the onions and fry over a low heat until caramelised. Now add the almonds and cinnamon and stir until toasted. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the remaining ghee and honey. Bubble over a high heat until it starts to caramelise, then gently add the quince and cook until it is caramelised. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p></li>  <li><p>Toss the onions, lamb and almonds back into the pan. Sprinkle over the ground ginger, coriander and cumin and fry until fragrant. </p></li>  <li><p>Scatter in the rice and preserved lemon, season and toast. Then pour in the hot stock. Cover the pan and turn the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed the stock. </p></li>  <li><p>Return the quince to the pan and cover the rice, leaving it to steam for a further three to four minutes. </p></li>  <li><p>To serve, drizzle over the saffron milk, leaving some of the rice stained and some still white, and scatter over a handful of golden sultanas, crispy shallots, parsley and rose petals.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Spiced apple and blackberry meringue roulade</h2> <p>Serves eight </p> <p><strong>For the spiced apple and blackberries</strong></p> <p><strong>For the meringue</strong></p> <p><strong>For the filling</strong></p> <p><strong>To make the spiced fruit filling</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Put all the ingredients, except the blackberries, in a saucepan set over a medium heat. </p></li>  <li><p>Heat the liquid until just boiling, then reduce to the lowest temperature and poach until the apples are just tender, but still have bite. </p></li>  <li><p>Take off the heat, cool for 30 minutes and add blackberries, leaving them to infuse in the poaching liquid. Once completely cool, drain. Reserve the liquid as a mixer for cocktails. </p></li> </ol> <p><strong>To make the meringue</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Begin by mixing the blackberries, 25g of the caster sugar and 30ml water in a small pan. Bring to boil and simmer for five minutes, until the berries are very soft. Blend until smooth and strain through a sieve into a bowl, discarding the seed. Cool. </p></li>  <li><p>Preheat the oven to 200C. Line a 23cm x 33cm baking tray with parchment paper and lightly grease with oil.</p></li>  <li><p>In a bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Gradually whisk in the caster sugar a little at a time and continue until thick and glossy. Fold in the vanilla extract, vinegar and corn flour. Spread the meringue evenly into the prepared baking tray. Dollop tablespoons of blackberry purée over the meringue. Use a knife or skewer to swirl it through the meringue and bake for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 170C and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p></li>  <li><p>Dust another sheet of parchment paper with icing sugar.</p></li>  <li><p>Remove the meringue from the oven and leave to cool for two to three minutes on the tray, before turning out on to the second piece of parchment paper. Cool for a further five minutes, then gently peel off the first sheet of parchment paper from the top of the meringue. Roll up the meringue from the long side until ready for use.</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>To make the filling</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Whip the double cream with icing sugar and vanilla beans and then fold in the beaten mascarpone.</p></li>  <li><p>Unroll the meringue, spread the cream mix over the surface, top with the drained poached fruit, and roll up again as tightly as you can, using the paper to help you. Refrigerate for at least an hour to firm up, then serve in slices.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Ravinder Bhogal is chef-patron of </em><a href=\"https://www.jikonilondon.com/\"><em>Jikoni</em></a><em>.
