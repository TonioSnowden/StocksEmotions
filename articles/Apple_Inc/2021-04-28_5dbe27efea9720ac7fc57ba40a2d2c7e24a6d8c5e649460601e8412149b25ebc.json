  "text": "<p>While access to the latest and greatest semiconductor technology is becoming a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8336169e-d1a8-4be8-b143-308e5b52e355\">geopolitical struggle</a>, involving the US, China, Taiwan and South Korea, manufacturers are facing an immediate problem of how to get hold of more mundane chips that are essential to their businesses.</p> <p>Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are powering ahead of America's Intel in having moved down to the 5-nanometre node — a smaller size that can pack more transistors and power into the latest PC processors — but that's a sledgehammer to crack a nut applied to chips tasked with simpler functions in cars and home appliances.</p> <p>This is where the current shortages are being keenly felt, with multiple carmakers forced to halt production lines and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475\">even toaster makers </a>suffering from the squeeze on supplies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d431e187-5108-4f32-bf1f-26fe51f3c517\">Kathrin Hille in Taipei and Song Jung-a in Seoul report</a> this has led to a highly unusual deal being struck by the customers of United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the world's fourth-largest contract chipmaker. They are providing financial guarantees for UMC to produce for them what is essentially old technology — 20,000 wafers a month for chips at the 28-nanometre node.</p> <p>UMC said the deal was an “innovative, win-win” arrangement. “This will strengthen our financial position to capture the market opportunity,” Jason Wang, UMC president, told investors.</p> <p>Liu Chi-tung, chief financial officer, added: “We have seen lots of capacity expansion in advanced nodes, but companies have not addressed the mature nodes. There are lots of critical components on those nodes.”</p> <p>It looks as if supplies will be tight for some time to come, meaning chipmakers can expect to operate at full capacity and charge higher prices — UMC is at 100 per cent and expects prices to rise 10 per cent this year.</p> <p>Chipmakers elsewhere are also benefiting — Texas Instruments beat expectations and raised forecasts in its earnings report overnight, with its shipments to the auto industry up 25 per cent. NXP also reported a 24 per cent increase in its automotive business.</p> <p>Netherlands-based NXP is one of Europe's semiconductor industry champions referred to by Pat Gelsinger, Intel's new chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34b07427-6bca-431d-8406-62762fc46941\">in an FT opinion piece</a>. But, as he points out, Europe is not in control of its own destiny here — its share of the global semiconductor market currently sits at around 10 per cent, down from a heady 44 per cent in 1990.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Alphabet's record quarter</strong><br>Google's parent Alphabet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c686458c-e544-4c50-990d-954b91d955ed\">reported record results</a> as the pandemic kept people at home, watching YouTube videos and clicking on web ads. It also announced a $50bn share buyback programme, helping send its shares 4 per cent higher today. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2fe4ef6-52f9-4838-9656-1cac956661a0\">Lex says</a> 34 per cent top-line growth&#xa0;is spectacular.</p> <p><strong>2. Microsoft boosted by X factor</strong><br>Surging sales of Windows PCs and new gaming consoles, along with a growing dependence during the pandemic on digital services delivered through the cloud, pushed Microsoft's financial performance <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/322f116d-8280-4a95-8392-6f59179d9d91\">ahead of expectations</a>. It recorded a 34 per cent jump in sales of Xbox following the launch of the new Series X and S consoles, while revenues for its Azure cloud computing platform grew 46 per cent.</p> <p><strong>3. Sony expects PS5 to outpace 4</strong><br>Sony said it hoped sales of its new PlayStation 5 console would outpace those of the PS4, as the pandemic-driven gaming boom lifted its<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea46f10f-8fe0-4e8b-827d-a25be65dba77\"> annual profits to a record</a>. Since its November launch, Sony has sold 7.8m PS5s. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97672f16-c1e3-48c0-ab92-1fca9341999a\">Lex says</a> its disappointing profit forecast suggests market expectations have outrun reality.</p> <p><strong>4. Apple turns down AirPods volume</strong><br>Apple's earnings are after the market close in New York and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c771d98e-75fa-48e5-8477-f466e72d6e27\">here's what to expect.</a> This week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db1fa50f-1862-458b-a7e3-840863937943\">#techAsia newsletter reports </a>growing competition from Asian rivals including Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei is forcing Apple to cut planned production of AirPods by 25 to 30 per cent this year.</p> <p><strong>5. Zomato to deliver IPO</strong><br>Food delivery group Zomato plans to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c120a41f-f3ee-4cac-b3ff-66364f8b974d\"> raise up to $1.1bn</a> in an initial public offering, setting the stage for what would be India's biggest listing so far this year. The Gurgaon-based company, which counts Jack Ma's Ant Group and Uber as major shareholders, was last valued at $5.4bn in a fundraising round in February. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12c0d9bd-c4bd-4bc5-8a6b-bb6ec1408269\">Lex has been assessing</a> the US delivery app DoorDash's new, lower commissions. </p> <h2>Tech tools — Samsung Galaxy laptops</h2> <p>Samsung unveiled three <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/galaxy-book/\">new laptop models </a>at its Galaxy Unpacked event today: the Galaxy Book Pro notebook, the Pro 360, pictured, which is a touchscreen convertible, and the&#xa0;Galaxy Book Odyssey, a gaming laptop. The first two start at $999.99 (£1,100) and $1,199.99 (£1,200) and are available now for pre-ordering with shipping in mid-May. The Odyssey will be available in August from $1,399. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date\">The Verge says</a> the Pro and Pro 360 are Samsung's first laptops with OLED displays and they are very light: the 13.3in version of the Pro weighs just 1.92 pounds (0.87kg), while the Pro 360 models start at 2.29 pounds. </p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Chips with gravy' FT.com 28 April.
