  "text": "<p>Darren Everson, The Wall Street Journal's deputy chief news editor, has compiled these key points to keep in mind:</p><p>—Putin's Nazi claim: When making reference to it, we should say in our own words that it is false. This passage from Journal reporter Yaro Trofimov's article on the subject is a good template: Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified his war on Ukraine by the need to \"de-Nazify\" its government, falsely claiming that Kyiv is controlled by a cabal of American-sponsored neo-Nazis. [But note: We have now updated our Tansa spell-checker to make clear that denazify is our spelling, following the entry in our base dictionary, Webster's New World College 5th.]</p><p>—Other Russian claims: When we generally speak about other Putin/Russian claims—alleged Western aggression, Ukraine nuclear capability, genocide against Russian speakers, etc.—we should include some response, such as there being no evidence of that or something similar.</p><p>—No-fly zone: Include when referring to it the latest U.S. and/or NATO comment on their refusal and rationale, along with Russia's previous statement on it. Here is a good example from a recent article: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has rejected requests for a no-fly zone, saying it would risk war with Russia—an outcome that Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened if any NATO members enter the conflict.</p><p>—Unknown/unclear: Don't say that something is unclear or unknown when we mean that it is unknown to us. A workaround is to say \"it couldn't be determined.\" [In fact, this goes for all coverage, not just Ukraine; Deputy Editor in Chief Neal Lipschutz says it is important for maintaining trust in our journalism to let readers know that we don't know when that is the situation.]</p><p>—Refugees/migrants: Refer to people who have fled Ukraine as refugees. Don't use migrants as a synonym. (Migrants choose to leave; refugees are forced to.) Also, be aware of this distinction when referencing other conflicts. A few outlets have drawn criticism for referring to Syrian war refugees as migrants.</p><p>By the way, jet fighter is our preferred, more-common label rather than fighter jet for the military aircraft, though neither is wrong.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Journal will continue to consider the transliterations of city names, many of which have what are considered either Russian or Ukrainian forms. In 2019, the Journal and other publications changed to the Ukrainian spelling Kyiv for the nation's capital (pronounced roughly as keev), instead of the Russian spelling Kiev. The Journal's style remains Odessa for the Ukrainian city on the Black Sea, following the preferred spelling in Webster's. Others including Associated Press have switched to the alternative spelling Odesa, the Ukrainian form.</p><p>All these issues are about more than just words. For example, Ukraine doesn't have a the before it, since doing so implies the country is part of a larger whole. Referring to \"the Ukraine\" is the Russian point of view.</p><p>The stylebook's 'disability, disabled' entry</p><p>The Journal's stylebook entry has been updated for more context and information. It now directs that we typically use the term autistic people, rather than people with autism. That could surprise some readers, because in general, the people with construction often seems more appropriate when describing people.</p><p>However, people with autism is a \"person first\" construction that, in some advocates' view, implies that the condition is a negative, says Laura Casey, a research editor at WSJ. Magazine who is focusing on coverage involving disabilities as part of the newsroom's WSJ Trust Fellowship program. She notes that in an influential 1999 essay arguing against person-first language, the autistic activist Jim Sinclair wrote that a semantic construct that separates the condition from the person inherently implies that the characteristic is negative, and even incompatible with one's humanity.</p><p>So, his preference and Laura's and the stylebook's is autistic people.</p><p>That said, these language issues are rarely easy. Some autistic people do still prefer person with autism. So when describing an individual, ask the person, if possible, for his or her preference.</p><p>Cliché corner</p><p>Let's continue to root out bureaucratic words such as finalize (particularly disliked by Editor in Chief Matt Murray) and instead focus on plain language—complete or finish. (The Tansa spell-checker helps with this; it homes in on finalize and other problem words and points out the Journal's style rules. Finalize is also one of more than 70 words and phrases listed in the stylebook's clichés, overused words entry.)</p><p>Avoid the cliché of Big X for industries, such as Big Oil, Big Tobacco, Big Tech, all of which give our editor in chief a Big Headache. Like the phrase Corporate America, all of these too-easy labels imply a monolith.</p><p>Meanwhile, existential, as in existential threat, remains one of journalism's most tiresome clichés, as we wrote about in 2015.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* Labcorp, not LabCorp, as of late 2020, is the capping for the second reference to Laboratory Corp. of America.</p><p>* The U.S. asset-management business and its Scottish parent formerly known as Aberdeen are now named abrdn, though since we don't use all-lowercase company names, it is Abrdn to our articles. (Julie Steinberg wrote this A-hed last year when the parent company first made the switch.)</p><p>* If there is an absolute need (and this should be rare) to identify ourselves in a Wall Street Journal article, use the phrase told The Wall Street Journal, regardless of the Dow Jones platform involved. (Dow Jones Newswires itself can still cite Dow Jones if that is the source.)</p><p>* The \"full\" name of a company, including the Inc. or Co., is used in news articles about that company. But it isn't necessary, and in fact can be distracting, in other contexts—such as when referring to a report or analyst from that company within an economics article.</p><p>* Be careful with the phrase couldn't be reached immediately if enough time has passed after we sought comment. A reader noticed the phrase in the print paper, even though it would seem likely that the issue was no longer immediate.</p><p>* Data has become acceptable as either a singular or plural term (singular can mean a collection of information). So it can take either verb (is/are). But don't switch back and forth within the same article, which sometimes happens.</p><p>* A note about \"stand-alone\" cities in datelines, which are listed in the stylebook. When needed for clarity within an article, it is all right to include the country with a city that would otherwise stand alone in a dateline. For example, in a U.S.-focused feature that quotes someone from Edinburgh, which stands alone in a dateline, it might be useful to specify Edinburgh, Scotland.</p><p>Reefer madness</p><p>A recent WSJ article about talking to teens about cannabis gummies prompted the question: Is cannabis gummies a term that only a parent would use?</p><p>Reporter Rob Copeland, for one, says the more-common names are weed gummies, marijuana gummies, THC gummies or as the article itself used several times, simply edibles, if clear in context.</p><p>The article's reporter, Andrea Petersen, says all the terms are largely used interchangeably. She says weed gummies, marijuana gummies and THC gummies are more commonly used by the industry itself in marketing. But cannabis edibles and cannabis gummies are terms that nonetheless are favored by researchers who study them \"because it is more accurate—the gummies contain THC and other cannabinoids from the cannabis plant,\" Andrea says.</p><p>Cheerio!</p><p>We love our British friends (and readers) but Briticisms are another story.</p><p>As S&amp;S has noted before, The Wall Street Journal has a global reach but is written in American English. So it is jarring when Briticisms sneak in, such as in 2016 when the headline \"Tax Rule Scuppers $8 Billion Deal\" was published. (We needed to say Scuttles or Ruins.)</p><p>Other Briticisms to watch out for include wrong-footed (putting someone in a tough situation) and step change (an important shift), as well as British spellings such as recognise rather than recognize.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Nathan Chen's Yellow Brick Road to Gold,\" ​suggested by Jason Gay, for a Sports feature about the skater and his Elton John soundtrack.</p><p>* \"Six People You Meet in the Pandemic Workplace,\" by Emily Gitter, nodding to the novel \"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\"</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* Millionaires from all over the country are moving to this little-known suburb</p><p>* He promised Putin a quick victory. Now he could become the scapegoat for Russia's flawed strategy in Ukraine.</p><p>* The 18-year-old sat in his bedroom, searching for info on the FBI tip line.
