  "title": "The Future of Everything: The Transportation Issue --- Q&A: Detroit's Software Update",
  "text": "<p>For traditional auto makers, the ability to update cars like an iPhone is in its infancy, though Tesla Inc. pioneered the practice. When Ford Motor Co. was looking for help with the digital transition, it plucked Doug Field, a former Tesla and Apple Inc. executive, to lead the charge in coming up with new digital features.</p><p>Mr. Field spent five years at Tesla, including as engineering chief, where he helped develop the Model 3. He did two stints at Apple, most recently starting in 2018 as vice president of special projects, before joining Ford in September.</p><p>He talked to The Future of Everything about what to expect from the car-ownership experience in the years ahead. Electrification and at least partial automation will be the norm, he predicts. For auto makers, the real differentiator will be offering an immersive experience, transforming the vehicle into a home-entertainment studio or conference room.</p><p>What's a feature that people will pay for five years from now?</p><p>Autonomy is the best example. You might choose different packages, a subscription-based service for how the vehicle operates autonomously. That's already the way it works at Tesla. Once you have autonomy, you've unlocked the ability to do other things in the vehicle. Today, there are features that are fully hands off, but you've got to keep your eyes on the road. I'm talking hands off, eyes off [in the future]. And if you need to drive again, you have plenty of notice. It's a very gentle experience to take over, and if you don't, there's a very gentle response to pull over into a safe situation.</p><p>Will car owners be able to remotely choose features a la carte?</p><p>Content absolutely will be a la carte. You could have a circle of friends who decide they're going to buy a car together. There's a little scheduling app that basically keeps track of who's going to use the vehicle when, making sure that it's charged in between. So it's not just the software inside the vehicle, but it's also the services that free people from the burden of car ownership while maintaining their connection with the product.</p><p>People will choose their vehicles for different reasons?</p><p>You don't show off your phone anymore. And your identity doesn't feel threatened when somebody else has an iPhone 13. My differentiation is in things like my Twitter page or my Instagram. It's a very different way that people create their identity, whereas in the past, a car was a big part of that. I think that will largely fade away.</p><p>Can the car companies compete with Big Tech?</p><p>Where the auto manufacturers can do things that are really special are vehicle-specific. The companies that do this really well will have products that people will walk out of their homes and sit in for the experience, even if they're not going anywhere.</p><p>---</p><p>Interview has been condensed and edited.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
