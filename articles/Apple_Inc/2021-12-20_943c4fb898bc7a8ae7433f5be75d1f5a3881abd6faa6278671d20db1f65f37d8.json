  "text": "<h1>Welcome to Your Fantasy</h1> <p>Natalia Petrzela brings together <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d145f744-59e1-4cb2-ab32-108eb27b020c\">cultural history, gender politics and true crime</a> as she investigates the rise of exotic dance troupe The Chippendales and a murder that took place in its midst. It's a wild story, taking in backstage orgies, drugs and warring business partners, delivered with a combination of curiosity and amusement by the host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3peO5EoD0YeRh7xcFMncDM\"><em>Spotify</em></a></p> <h1>Human Resources</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64a098d7-4d36-4136-b14f-3920897818f5\">A powerful and elegantly produced series</a> in which the journalist Moya Lothian-McLean, a descendant both of black African slaves and white slave owners, looks at Britain's relationship with its colonial history and the ways slavery has shaped British life, from its social structures to its cultural and financial institutions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6DFKmhsCeMdOQUTfShcdx9\"><em>Spotify</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>9/12</h1> <p>Dan Taberski's name is a marker of quality in the pod world and his series looking at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c76af06c-2111-45d5-80cf-3be32ce8f1eb\">aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks</a> in the US and how the country was altered is his best yet. Themes include the ethics of satire, the rise of conspiracy theories and a little-known CIA wheeze in which Hollywood screenwriters were asked to forecast future terrorist plots.</p> <p><a href=\"https://music.amazon.co.uk/podcasts/4d14a730-e337-4659-9699-daa2991e2b1d/9-12\"><em>Amazon</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>Pseudocide</h1> <p>Every episode of Poppy Damon and Alice Fiennes' podcast examining <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d2a1321-cb85-4bea-9bfc-7c9117a3b242\">death fraud through the ages</a> is like a mini Hollywood movie. The series focuses variously on a women's rights activist who feigned drowning in order to leave her marriage; a 14th-century nun who faked her death to escape her life of poverty and obedience; and the Texan man who avoided being murdered by pretending he was already dead.</p> <p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/4XWStGCCFR3QrRpdqXbGj8\"><em>Spotify</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>The Battersea Poltergeist</h1> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0605024-9f0e-4aa9-9722-7a6bc72f3ade\">spookily atmospheric series</a> mixes documentary and drama to tell the story of the Hitchings family who, in 1956, claimed they had a poltergeist in their Battersea home, prompting police, reporters and psychics to flock to their doorstep. Presenter Danny Robins talks to Shirley Hitchings who is now 80 and, all these years later, hasn't wavered from her version of events.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0940193\"><em>BBC</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>Things Fell Apart</h1> <p>Jon Ronson's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/955bed9d-93f4-408d-9fa1-3da7047fc320\">thoughtful and empathetic dissection</a> of the culture wars looks at the stories behind today's lightning-rod topics and talks to those embroiled in the ideological clashes of the past. Meet the film-maker who sparked a discussion about abortion; the pastor's wife unhappy with her children's school textbooks; and the man who prompted outrage when he made an off-colour joke on the internet in the 1980s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0011cpr\"><em>BBC</em></a></p> <h1>Forever is a Long Time</h1> <p>Comprising a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4dea23c-3829-436d-9bf2-4f100d14562d\">deeply personal conversations</a> with close relatives, Ian Coss's podcast looks at the marriages in his family that ended in divorce, which is most of them. It sounds bleak but the series is frank, funny and open-hearted as it delves into generational differences, societal expectations and the different ways people get through difficult times.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/forever-is-a-long-time/id1570813696\"><em>Apple</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>365 Stories I Want to Tell You Before We Both Die</h1> <p>In this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd6b85bc-4734-4d5c-b38e-81d6b982b3fc\">ambitious and delightful daily podcast</a>, which comes to an end on December 31, the San Francisco film-maker Caveh Zahedi provides autobiographical snapshots via short (no more than four-minute-long) stories that variously captivate, discomfort and amuse. Not all of them paint their author in a positive light but they each tell us something significant about life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/365-stories-i-want-to-tell-you-before-we-both-die/id1546719658\"><em>Apple</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>Why Do I Feel?</h1> <p>It's rare to find a podcast on the subject of mental health that doesn't deal in living-your-best-life platitudes. But Nathan Filer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e47a76e-6cf5-43aa-9e24-326e1d7f8bd3\">terrifically enlightening <em>Why Do I Feel?</em></a> is clear in its aim to examine particular emotions such as anger, guilt and envy and tell human stories that shed light on why we feel them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/why-do-i-feel/id1581258985\"><em>Apple</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>Call Me Mother</h1> <p>Shon Faye's excellent interview series highlighting the stories of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9126bf09-490f-4297-8e59-6117ca94ef4d\">unsung queer trailblazers</a> features Caroline Paige, a Royal Air Force navigator who came out as trans; Brad Becker, who founded the LGBT National Help Center, a phone service providing life-saving support to the queer community; and Siobhan Fahey, member of the feminist lesbian punk collective Rebel Dykes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/call-me-mother/id1556479286\"><em>Apple</em></a>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'Top 10 podcasts of 2021' FT.com 20 December.
