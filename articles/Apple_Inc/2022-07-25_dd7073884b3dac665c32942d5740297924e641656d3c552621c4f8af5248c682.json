  "text": "<p>The Fed on Wednesday is expected to deliver another 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase as it attempts to cool soaring inflation. Markets have swung this year as investors worry that the central bank's aggressive tightening will lead the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, said recent earnings reports have shown recession concerns on the rise in corporate America—though that hasn't necessarily led to big stock selloffs.</p><p>So far investors have largely brushed off disappointing earnings. Shares of S&amp;P 500 companies that missed Wall Street's forecasts have fallen 0.1% on average in the two days before their report through the two days after, according to FactSet. That compares with the five-year average of a 2.4% decline.</p><p>\"What markets want at the moment is recessionary fears to cause the Federal Reserve to back off,\" Mr. Park said. \"The idea that lots of companies are talking about recessionary fears…in some ways plays to that narrative, so that's why markets have been shrugging off some of the poorer earnings guidance.\"</p><p>Recession fears are being reflected in the inversion of the U.S. yield curve, which happens when shorter-dated yields such as for the two-year Treasury note are higher than for longer-dated debt such as the 10-year. That is seen by investors as a key recession predictor.</p><p>The two-year Treasury yield rose to 2.997% Monday from 2.989% on Friday, while the 10-year climbed to 2.798% from 2.781%. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Earnings reports are expected this week from major technology firms including Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon. The results could determine whether a recent rebound in beaten-down tech shares will continue.</p><p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite, which is down 24% this year, has risen 7.3% in July. It is now on course for its best month since November 2020.</p><p>In Europe, stocks were mixed Monday as investors also assessed financial updates from companies and economic data.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped less than 0.1% while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was flat. Germany's benchmark DAX index fell 0.3% after the Ifo business-climate index showed a sharp deterioration in business confidence amid an energy crisis in Europe's largest economy.</p><p>German auto maker Volkswagen's shares fell 4.3% after Chief Executive Herbert Diess was ousted last week. Mr. Diess will be succeeded by Oliver Blume, CEO of VW's sports-car maker Porsche AG.</p><p>Ryanair shares edged up 0.2% after the budget Irish carrier swung to a profit in its latest quarter even as the war in Ukraine has disrupted bookings.</p><p>Shares of Dutch health-technology company Royal Philips slid 11% after the company reported a loss for the second quarter and cut guidance for the year. It blamed pandemic-related lockdowns in China, inflationary pressures and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude prices—the global benchmark—fell 0.2% to $98.17 a barrel. Prices are down 10% in the past month as investors worry an economic slowdownwill hit demand for crude.</p><p>Indexes in Asia mostly fell. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.2%, Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.8% and China's benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 0.6%.</p><p>—Hannah Miao contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Edge Up Ahead of Fed, Earnings</p>",
