  "text": "<p>Aggreko shareholders may be feeling short changed after the power generator hire group accepted a £2.3bn bid from a private equity consortium</p> <p>TDR Capital and I Squared Capital agreed to buy the business for 880p a share in cash. Their bid offers a 39 per cent premium to Aggreko's closing price on February 4, the day before takeover interest was first reported. </p> <p>“The Aggreko board believes that the offer . . . represents an attractive price in cash that fairly recognises&#xa0;Aggreko's&#xa0;future prospects,” chairman Ken Hanna said.</p> <p>Aggreko shares traded as high as 889p on Thursday after <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/platinum-is-said-to-approach-aggreko-as-tdr-talks-progress\">Bloomberg reported</a> that rival private equity group Platinum&#xa0;Equity&#xa0;was examining a possible offer, though its interest was seen as less likely to translate into a deal. The Takeover Panel had put a deadline of 5pm on Friday for TDR Capital's consortium to make a firm offer or walk away. </p> <p>“Our view is that Aggreko has caved in too easily and that the shares are worth more,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Brooke. A takeout valuation of around 5.5 times 2022 operating earnings “is relatively low compared to other strategic deals whilst recovery and medium-term growth prospects look sound,” he said.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> reported revenue growth across all business lines ahead of the acquisition of Refinitiv completed in January. Sales for 2020 grew 3 per cent to £2.1bn with operating profit up 2 per cent to £755m, in line with market expectations. The full-year dividend was raised 7 per cent to 75p a share. For the current year LSE flagged increased investment, meaning operating expense increases of mid-single digits year-on-year, with depreciation and amortisation charges also expected to rise.</p> <p>Mike Ashley's <strong>Frasers Group</strong> said it “wishes to note its disappointment at the business rates relief announced” in Wednesday's UK budget. A temporary £2m business rates cap beginning July is “a near worthless support package for large retailers” that “will make it nearly impossible to take on ex-Debenhams sites with the inherent jobs created,” the company said. “It will also mean we need to review our entire portfolio to ascertain stores that are unviable due to unrealistic business rates.”</p> <p><strong>Saga</strong>, the specialist insurer and cruise line operator, said it reached an agreement with lenders to defer by a year covenant checks to debt tied to its cruise ship facilities. The actions taken give enough headroom for travel suspensions to continue well into the second half of the year, Saga said.</p> <p><strong>Spirent Commuications</strong> has agreed to buy US-based Wi-Fi and 5G network testing equipment maker OctoScope for up to $73m. OctoScope founder Fanny Mlinarsky along with management and other investors will receive $55m in cash upfront with the rest based on revenue and staff retention targets.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is planning to become a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4f74dc-7e32-448d-9eb0-9fb264a3c8c7\">large private landlord</a> as it searches for new sources of revenue in an era of low interest rates. The initiative will involve buying and renting out new and existing housing stock across the UK, and aims to have its first tenants by the end of this year, people familiar with the plans told the FT.</p> <p>Plastics maker <strong>Essentra</strong> said a “resilient performance, encouraging outlook and strong financial position” meant it was able to resume dividend payments. Its 2020 results showed adjusted operating profit down 27.9 per cent to £62m on disposals and manufacturing inefficiencies linked to the pandemic.</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p>Online travel agent <strong>On The Beach</strong> said it has appointed former Conservative minister Justine Greening as a non-executive director with immediate effect. Greening left government in 2018, having spent eight years in ministerial roles including a stint as transport secretary between 2011 and 2012.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>The EU is set to bring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d37c476c-b4cd-4b47-9ed2-d19ad2341ea8\">antitrust charges</a> against <strong>Apple</strong> for the first time. According to several people familiar with the case, the EU will act on a complaint brought two years ago by the music streaming site Spotify, which said Apple was taking a 30 per cent cut of its subscription fees for featuring it in the App Store. Spotify also complained that Apple Music was able to undercut it on price because it did not have to pay the same 30 per cent fee.</p> <p>Sticking with music streaming and mobile payments company <strong>Square</strong> has agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b720ff5a-f0f6-4417-b479-814c1e4f6bd5\">to acquire a majority stake</a> in Tidal, the struggling platform owned by Jay-Z, for $297m. Square, co-founded by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, said it would pay for Tidal in a mix of cash and stock and will nominate Jay-Z to its board of directors. Due Diligence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10ca8739-4a09-4286-919f-7d99d3c5e600\">delves into</a> the curious deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sanjeev Gupta's <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2be5828-a4d1-475f-96ba-de239ae968a7\">stopped</a> making payments to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">Greensill Capital</a>, the ailing finance group that helped transform the former commodities trader into a leading player in the global steel industry, according to people briefed on the move. The move marks a stunning rupture between Gupta's GFG and Greensill, whose close links have drawn the scrutiny of regulators.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Lombard</strong> <br>Deliveroo was once considered a weak competitor in the food delivery business, until Covid-19 came to lift all boats. Now it's hailed as a British tech champion. Those rushing to celebrate its decision <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dcf0a69-5331-4eaf-87e9-ccee2e4c9463\">to list in London</a> might soon wish they had waited to see exactly what's inside the box.</p> <p><strong>Tom Braithwaite</strong> <br>It is insurance — the supposedly sober, even sleepy, side of finance — that is key to understanding the Greensill crisis, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30069077-b966-4f41-a4df-f79aadcf0479\">writes our companies editor</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
