  "text": "<p>Having a major pianist like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b151c170-f2ea-41ee-8ab8-31fa56331b5d\">Lang Lang</a>, <a href=\"http://katiemahan.de/\">Katie Mahan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.steinway.com/artists/robert-glasper\">Robert Glasper</a> come round to do a private performance could be a bit of a budget-stretcher. But so long as you're good for £127,000 to £467,500 for a new Steinway Grand incorporating the&#xa0;company's latest tech feature, Spirio R, you can have any of dozens of big names – including pianists no longer with us such&#xa0;as&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.steinway.com/artists/vladimir-horowitz\">Vladimir Horowitz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.steinway.com/artists/arthur-rubinstein\">Arthur Rubinstein</a> – play for you every evening.</p> <p>Spirio R is a self-play piano system, the type that offers the slightly spooky vision of&#xa0;the keys playing themselves. Many of the&#xa0;thousands of recordings available from Steinway are accompanied by streamed video of the performance. So with a Spirio R piano and a big TV, the illusion of a virtuoso playing live for you is not far off complete.</p> <p>Sceptics may say that you could just play a music DVD of a performer, but no&#xa0;matter how good your sound bar or&#xa0;hifi&#xa0;is, a Steinway grand is always going&#xa0;to sound vastly better.</p> <p>It's not just a question of the keys plonking down in a particular order. When&#xa0;an artist like Lang Lang records&#xa0;a&#xa0;piece for Spirio R, it picks up&#xa0;the&#xa0;subtleties&#xa0;of every key press – the&#xa0;system&#xa0;can detect 1,024 “velocity steps”.&#xa0;So&#xa0;the auto-Lang Lang that plays&#xa0;in&#xa0;your home is&#xa0;to all intents and&#xa0;purposes him.</p> <p>When it comes to performers who departed decades too early to record specifically for Spirio R, Steinway analyses&#xa0;existing audio recordings so as to&#xa0;reproduce as closely as possible the original key strokes, and then, for the video,&#xa0;match up original film recordings.</p> <p>Steinway has been making self-play instruments for six years now for the high&#xa0;proportion of buyers who can't actually play piano. But the new Spirio R system is&#xa0;more sophisticated than the 2015&#xa0;version. For instance, rather wonderfully for those who do play, you can&#xa0;record your own work&#xa0;and edit it to&#xa0;perfection on the dedicated iPad that comes with a Spirio R piano. You&#xa0;can even post your polished <em>Meisterstück</em> on social media.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Steinway Spirio R from £127,000, </em><a href=\"https://steinway.co.uk/pianos/spirio-r/\"><em>steinway.co.uk</em></a></p><p>Source: Jonathan Margolis 2021 'It's going to be a Lang Lang time: the ultimate self-playing Steinway' FT.com 3 May.
