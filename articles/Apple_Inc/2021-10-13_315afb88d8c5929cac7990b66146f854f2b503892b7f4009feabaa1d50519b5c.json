  "text": "<p>Things were primed for AMC on Wednesday morning as the hashtag #AMCSqueeze continued to trend on Twitter and the theater chain's meme-friendly CEO Adam Aron and the theater chain's meme-friendly CEO waxed poetic on the social-media app  about Marvel's upcoming superhero blockbuster “Eternals.”</p><p>Optimism on AMC stock was further fueled by speculation that hedge funds that are naked shorting the stock will have to cover in the coming week or two, leading to a possible gain of 30% or greater.</p><p>That theory spilled over into trading on GameStop and BlackBerry, which both closed up around 5% as retail investors openly crowed about both tickers. Mentions of BlackBerry — which also announced some new software deals Wednesday — popped over 1,000% according to data from HypeEquity.</p><p>While GameStop's Stans were a prime driver of the day's move, a big moment for the stock came in response to Robinhood's aspiringly cool tweet.</p><p>At 1:51 p.m., Robinhood's Twitter account tried to capitalize on the new “red flag” meme by tweeting “Investing isn't for everyone,” adding the red flag emojis meant to denote toxic opinions.</p><p>https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1448345557269815296 The tweet did not land with much of its target audience, as many pro-retail voices teed off on Robinhood, mentioning  its recent legal controversies  and generally mocking the attempt at solidarity with the Reddit Raiders movement.</p><p>In the end, the tweet brought to mind a different meme:</p><p>A similar tweet apparently did land for GameStop, though, which deployed the meme to much more popular effect:</p><p>https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/1448357191392665609 “1v1” is a popular phrase among gamers meant as a challenge to do battle. GameStop was trading near its intraday high when the tweet landed.</p><p>But it wasn't all sunshine in MemeVille.</p><p>Headphone-maker Koss Corporation KOSS fell back after Tuesday's manic ultra-late rally  to close down almost 3% on the day, falling almost 5% after noon, but still locking in some gains from speculation that it will prevail in its patent lawsuit with Apple Inc. AAPL.</p><p>Another meme ticker that had a rough day was DatChat Inc. DATS, which fell almost 27% on Wednesday. The stock had soared more than 100% on social-media speculation that the company would complete a deal with Barstool Sports, but while many speculated that the deal would be an acquisition, it turned out that DatChat will pay Barstool “a low seven-figure fee” to “launch a multi-channel, national marketing campaign” across Barstool properties.</p><p>But like a kid scraping an Italian ice, the best part of Wednesday for many meme traders came at the end when a sketchy report surfaced  on Twitter that the SEC's current investigation into retail-investor archenemy Citadel  was motivated by political animus towards the firm's founder, Ken Griffin.</p><p>We'll surely talk more about that on Thursday.</p>",
