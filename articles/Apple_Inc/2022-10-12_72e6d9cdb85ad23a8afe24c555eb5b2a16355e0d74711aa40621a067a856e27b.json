  "text": "<p>   Thousands of officials across the government's executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found. </p><p>   More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal. </p><p>   A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon. </p><p>   The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children. </p><p>   The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren't available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy. </p><p>   Among the findings: </p><p>   -- While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. </p><p>   -- More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies. </p><p>   -- More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021. </p><p>   -- At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies. </p><p>   -- About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed. </p><p>   -- When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency's work. </p><p>   Federal agency officials, many unknown to the public, wield \"immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,\" said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer. He said many examples in the Journal analysis \"clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of the government.\" </p><p>   Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. </p><p>    Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had financial interests, led to a law requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades. This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees. </p><p>   U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations direct them to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest. Those above a certain pay level file annual financial disclosures listing figures in a range. </p><p>   Most officials' financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency. </p><p>   Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven't turned over all of them. </p><p>   Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren't considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn't restrict investing in diversified funds. </p><p>   The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules in the executive branch, is \"committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,\" said a spokeswoman. </p><p>   At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such firms stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump's pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental rules and speeding up projects. </p><p>   Mr. Molina's job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He \"reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,\" said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a \"personal and confidential representative\" of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description. </p><p>   In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S. </p><p>   The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband's account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter trades into the EPA's electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act. </p><p>   Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don't conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal's review shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks. </p><p>   In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn't know much about the energy trades. \"I can say this on the record: I didn't even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,\" he said. </p><p>   In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   In about 2 1/2 years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina's disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser. </p><p>   In the month he was promoted, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines. Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry. </p><p>   After online publication, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: \"Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a 'pool' of several dozen clients -- not for us individually.\" </p><p>   Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency's ethics office \"counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.\" EPA officials signed Mr. Molina's financial-disclosure statement in each year he was at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren't working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina's boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters. </p><p>    Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes. </p><p>   Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias's portfolio. </p><p></p>",
