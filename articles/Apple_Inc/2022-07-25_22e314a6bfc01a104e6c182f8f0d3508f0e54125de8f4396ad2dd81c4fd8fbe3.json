  "title": "Why Julianne Moore Takes Two Baths a Day; The actor talks about being back on set, her philosophy on aging and the one beauty habit no one should pick up",
  "text": "<p>These days, the actor has been keeping busy, appearing in such productions as the film adaptation of Broadway's Dear Evan Hansen; Jesse Eisenberg's directorial debut, When You Finish Saving the World; Sharper, a thriller that will be released on Apple TV+; Joey Soloway's film adaptation of the bestselling book Mothertrucker; and May December, directed by her longtime collaborator Todd Haynes. It's a joy to be back on set, she says, following a period of pandemic precautions that brought the entertainment industry to a halt.</p><p>\"I'm excited,\" says Moore. \"In terms of the film business, we're getting back to work in a way that feels really good.\"</p><p>On top of her acting work, she and Freundlich are now part of a campaign for the beauty brand Hourglass Cosmetics. \"I love shooting with my daughter, and this felt incredibly personal,\" Moore says of the campaign, called \"We Glow.\" \"She's at the bottom end of what it is to be a young womanâ€”she's just coming into her consciousness as an adult.\"</p><p>Here, Moore speaks to WSJ. about what her days look like when she's not in front of the lens.</p><p>What time do you usually get up on Mondays?</p><p>I'm not a morning person. I'm a middle person. I realized recently that my ideal sleep cycle is from midnight to 8. When I can do that, I feel fantastic.</p><p>What's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>The first thing I do is drink two big glasses of water with chlorophyll in it. Someone told me a long time ago that it was really good for your skin, so I've always done it.</p><p>What do you have for breakfast after that?</p><p>Well I counter-effect the chlorophyll with a lot of coffee. Then I make my own smoothie with bananas and pineapple and spinach and coconut water and coconut oil and that Vital Proteins collagen powder.</p><p>Anything else you do to wake yourself up?</p><p>I like to take a bath in the morning and at night, with two whole cups of Epsom salts. In the morning it's a really, really short one, but it helps wake me up, believe it or not.</p><p>Are you a supplement person?</p><p>I am, but I take them at night because I was told you're supposed to have them with food. So, after dinner, I take a calcium supplement. I started taking iron, though I'm not too sure how that's going. And I take vitamin C, vitamin B and a probiotic.</p><p>What about skin care?</p><p>I like a mild cleanser like Neutrogena or Cetaphil or CeraVe. When my face got very chapped last winter, I discovered Furtuna Skin face oil and the Furtuna Skin replenishing balm, and they completely rehydrated my face. I get facials from Teresa Tarmey in London and Fabricio Ormonde in New York.</p><p>Your red hair is your trademark, who do you trust to tend to it?</p><p>Hair is impossible, as is trying to blow out your own hair. I'm very loyal to Vickie Vidov at Vidov [West] Salon in my neighborhood. I've been going there since 2009.</p><p>What keeps you busy in the morning?</p><p>I like to have a slow start to my day. I get on my iPad and look at the news. Then I play the New York Times Spelling Bee for longer than I should. I like to have enough time to read and then maybe take a yoga class. I do online yoga with the Shala; they had a Manhattan studio before the pandemic, but now it's all online, which is great. Then I go for a walk, return emails, read scripts.</p><p>Did anything about how you approach dressing in the morning change with the pandemic?</p><p>I want my clothes to be comfortable. I want to make sure I can move in everything, whether I'm walking or running or carrying something. Once you kind of get rid of all those uncomfortable shoes too, you're like, \"Why did I need them?\"</p><p>Do you and Liv ever share clothes or products?</p><p>It's funny because we obviously have different kinds of taste. Hers is more youthful, you know? She's out there wearing those tiny little crop tops and stuff like that. But we both comment on each other's clothes all the time and talk about fashion. In terms of sharing stuff, it really is funny having a daughter who's like, \"Mom, do you have any makeup remover? Mom, where's your mascara? Mom, where's your face wash?\" I've noticed all this stuff that's migrated to her bathroom.</p><p>Is there any beauty advice you've given her that maybe you wish you had received?</p><p>I always tell her never pluck your eyebrows. I destroyed mine.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>MORE IN MY MONDAY MORNING</p><p>* Michael Pollan on How Psychedelics Will Play a Bigger Role in American Life</p><p>* Derek Jeter Is Glad His '90s Nightlife Was Before Social Media</p><p>* Perfumer Ben Gorham on Working Out to Bulk Up in Middle Age</p><p>* Keith McNally on His Favorite NYC Spot and Why 80% of Instagram Posts Are Lies</p><p>* Manolo Blahnik on the Power of Freezing Cold Showers</p><p>Why Julianne Moore Takes Two Baths a Day</p>",
