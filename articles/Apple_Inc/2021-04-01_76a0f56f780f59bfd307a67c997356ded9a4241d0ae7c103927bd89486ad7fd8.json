  "title": "Technology:  Apple Backs Firm That Helps Artists  Release Music Without Major Labels  ----  By Anne Steele",
  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. is investing in independent music artists. </p><p>   The tech giant led a $50 million fundraising round for UnitedMasters, a three-year-old artist-services company that helps musicians distribute and market their music while allowing them to keep their copyrights. </p><p>   Launched in 2017 with $70 million in Silicon Valley backing, UnitedMasters is an alternative to the traditional major label system, which typically requires artists to give up the rights to their music in exchange for an advance, distribution, marketing and promotion. Artists choose to pay a $5 monthly subscription fee or give a 10% take to UnitedMasters, and retain ownership of their music. The company has released music from more than one million artists, including NLE Choppa, Lil Tecca, Lil XXEL, and recent breakouts Tobe Nwigwe and Curtis Roach, whose \"Bored in the House\" went viral on TikTok during the pandemic lockdowns. </p><p>   The investment ties into how Apple, which operates the world's second-largest streaming service by subscriptions, has positioned itself as creator-friendly. The investment is also a sign that new types of deals independent artists make to get their music out into the world are multiplying and taking hold in the industry. </p><p>   \"We've always been about trying to help artists and the best way to empower them is to make it easy for them to create and get their music out there,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's head of services. \"We want artists to be focused on creating the best music on the planet. That's their art and skill and it's hard to have to be the marketing person and the finance person and the salesperson and do all these things when you're starting out.\" </p><p>   UnitedMasters founder Steve Stoute was previously an executive at Sony Music Entertainment and Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records. He had also started ad agency Translation, which is now part of UnitedMasters and helps high-profile clients including the NBA, ESPN and State Farm connect with artists. </p><p>   Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Andreessen Horowitz, already investors in the company, also joined in the Series B funding round, which values UnitedMasters at $350 million. The money will be used for international expansion, hiring and building out technology. </p><p>   Independent artists represent the fastest-growing part of the recorded-music business. Revenue from indie labels and artists grew 27% in 2020, increasing their combined streaming market share to 31.5%, according to industry data provider Midia Research. Artists who distributed music without any label grew by a staggering 34.1% last year to become a billion-dollar market for the first time. </p><p>   When music was sold via CDs and digital downloads, signing to a label was essentially the only way for an artist to have their music broadly distributed, played on the radio and promoted. The rise of streaming on services like Spotify Technology SA and Apple Music has made it easier for artists to release their music when and how they want, with or without the help of a label. </p><p>   \"We're at the beginning of a new way these models around artists are going to work going forward -- everyone's moving from employee to ownership,\" said Mr. Stoute. </p><p>   Yet major labels continue to benefit the most from streaming services, which pay out from a pool of subscription and advertising revenue based on market share. While virtually anyone can release music on a streaming service, it's hard to stand out; Spotify has said over 60,000 new tracks are uploaded each day. </p><p></p>",
