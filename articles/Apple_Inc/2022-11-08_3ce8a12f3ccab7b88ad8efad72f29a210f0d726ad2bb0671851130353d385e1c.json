  "title": "Le Bernardin at 50: Still Going Strong; As the celebrated restaurant marks its golden anniversary, its co-founder, chef and well-known fans chart its long reign over the fine dining scene.",
  "text": "<p>These guests will arrive with certain expectations. No restaurant in America has sustained as exemplary a critical standing for as long as Le Bernardin, which has earned five four-star reviews from the New York Times since the institution's stateside debut in 1986. Few restaurants with three Michelin stars, as Le Bernardin has held since 2005, can match the scale, flexibility and atmospheric charge of this operation, where diners can sit for a meal that stretches on for hours or simply stop in for a bite before a Broadway show. At a time when a number of its fine-dining peers have closed or no longer figure in the conversation, Le Bernardin is an outlier among the old guard.</p><p>\"It's easy to forget that it wasn't always like this,\" says Le Coze, now in her 70s. She summons the words a New York City taxi driver at the Fulton Fish Market often said to Gilbert when he got into the cab—the only one waiting, every time—after a disappointing visit: Forget it, Frenchie. You'll never make it here.</p><p>It was 1985. The siblings had just arrived in the city to launch a second location of the Parisian restaurant they had opened, almost on a lark, in 1972. They had grown up in Brittany, one of the world's great capitals for seafood, spending summers working at the restaurant of their parents' inn. \"We were these good-looking kids having lots of fun in the capital who convinced ourselves, Well, we have a great background and so we should obviously open a restaurant,\" Le Coze says.</p><p>To do so, they borrowed money from the bank and from relatives. By way of interior design, Maguy went to the Marché St.-Pierre to pick up fabrics and used furniture. At the start, their parents prepped potatoes in the kitchen for a menu Maguy can still rattle off with ease. \"Because there wasn't much,\" she says. Le Bernardin made 700 francs (around $140) on its first night in business and faced bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Backs against the wall, the pair earned extra money consulting for another restaurant, all the while refining their approach. But by 1976, Le Bernardin had received its first Michelin star, and another followed in 1982.</p><p>Coming to the States was Maguy's idea; even though she had never visited New York City, she witnessed Le Bernardin's clientele turn predominantly American thanks to the pull of Michelin. Gilbert resisted her plan for four years. It had been hard enough with home-field advantage. At least in France, he didn't have to consider the possibility that the fishmongers would fail to provide him with impeccable examples of bass and rouget. In the Big Apple, the language barrier was only part of the problem. \"This taxi, every time, was the only one waiting on the street,\" says Le Coze. \"I think that tells you everything you need to know about how different things used to be when it came to finding excellent fish here.\"</p><p>\"I think it's very hard for anybody today to know what the fish business was like in America,\" says the author and former Gourmet editor Ruth Reichl, \"before Le Bernardin came along and showed us the way.\" In America, Reichl adds, \"We ate clams and oysters. We weren't big fish eaters. Maybe a French restaurant would have a fillet of sole. To get this fish that was fresh and not messed around with in a heavy sauce was really game-changing.\"</p><p>According to historian Paul Freedman, establishments like the Grand Central Oyster Bar already offered great quality, but \"maybe not as fanatically or with as much variety or nuance\" as Le Bernardin, he says. Ripert argues that his predecessor had an impact on the way fish was handled and delivered, and that he sent the industry an important message: \"Fish is amazing in America: snapper, grouper, black bass, monkfish, crabs. Enjoy your fish, America, be proud of it.\"</p><p>The first seismic celebration of Le Bernardin's promise arrived in March of 1986. That's when the New York Times restaurant critic Bryan Miller did the unheard of: He awarded it four stars, the paper's highest rating, only three months into its life on West 51st Street.</p><p>The restaurant instantly became a canteen for boldfaced names. (It was so successful that the Le Cozes closed their Paris location that same year.) In the 1980s, you could spot Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty and Mick Jagger in the dining room. Anthony Bourdain often evangelized about Le Bernardin and Ripert, his close friend. \"As sophisticated and extraordinary as it is, it's not just a special-occasion place,\" says the actor Richard Gere, who became friends with Ripert through their shared Buddhist faith; when they first met, the chef had just had an audience with the Dalai Lama at an event in New York. \"I can call up Eric and ask to pop in for a tea or a quick pasta for 45 minutes and then go back to work.\" Gere's wife, Alejandra Silva, shares a cherished anecdote. \"Our first real date was at Le Bernardin, so in many ways that restaurant is our love story,\" she says.</p><p>Padma Lakshmi, the author and Top Chef host, echoes Gere and Silva. \"Eric and the whole staff have a way of making very high art seem relaxed,\" she says, \"and there's an extraordinary amount of soul and humility to Eric but not much ego, which is refreshing in the world of white-male chefs.\" Ripert is also, Lakshmi points out, less of an expansionist than many in his echelon. The chef and humanitarian José Andrés sees importance in that detail as well: \"Eric is there.\"</p><p>In New York, just as she had in Paris, Le Coze managed the business while running the front of the house. \"I have eyes behind my head,\" she says. But she too had to adjust to the new landscape. She remembers what transpired one evening early on after she recognized a customer visiting from Paris. \"In France, I would give a kiss on the cheek to every customer, so of course that is what I did in my other restaurant. His wife hit him over the head with her purse, very hard! Gilbert told me later that night, 'You see, you can't do that here.' \"</p><p>Like Le Coze, Ripert has certain details from the restaurant's past fixed in his mind. \"I started at Le Bernardin on June 11, 1991, at 7:40 a.m.,\" he says. \"I remember looking at my watch before I walked through the door and thinking to myself that I would never, ever forget this moment.\" Gilbert had lured Ripert from the kitchen of David Bouley to introduce fresh ideas to Le Bernardin's menu, sensing promise in the young chef's Andorran roots, arduous training under Joël Robuchon and interest in cuisines beyond France.</p><p>Three years later, in 1994, Gilbert Le Coze died of a heart attack at the age of 49. Ripert was already a star chef de cuisine, but a relative unknown outside the walls of the restaurant. Was he up to the task? Could Le Bernardin even live on without Gilbert, a towering figure and darling of the American press whom Reichl describes as, \"God knows, just the sexiest man.\"</p><p>Le Coze remembers feeling as if \"Everybody in town was just waiting for me not to succeed. But I didn't give up. The first thing I did was get us a better lease. Then I had my little talk with Eric.\" Ripert, now 57, recalls that it did not take long for Le Coze to pull him aside one day and say, \"I don't want Le Bernardin to be a museum to the memory of my brother. We are moving forward with whatever menu you create.\"</p><p>The longevity of the partnership that came out of the crisis may be even more of an anomaly than Le Bernardin's enduring critical standing. \"I knew she had a reputation of having a sixth sense, seeing things with a very sharp eye,\" Ripert says. \"But I didn't really have too much interaction [while Gilbert was alive]. Then we started to work together: Oh, now I get it.\"</p><p>\"Believe me, right after Gilbert died, it was pretty much up to Maguy to maintain the standards,\" says Reichl. \"She ran [the restaurant] with an iron hand, a rigor. As a woman, I was always proud of her.\"</p><p>\"Maguy is not diplomatic,\" Ripert says. \"My biggest nightmare is because of Maguy. I didn't want to get out of the kitchen at the beginning. I am very shy by nature and discreet about my private life. I was very happy in my kitchen. Maguy wanted me to see the clients, and she had to almost physically push me…. My entire back would be covered in sweat after I went to have a 15-second conversation.\"</p><p>\"The first months, I was so used to the food of my brother—that doesn't look the same, taste the same,\" Le Coze says. \"Remember the famous fish, Eric?\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes, the snapper with a port sauce,\" he shoots back. \"Aged port and aged sherry vinegar. Snapper with five-spice on the skin, crusted, powerful, but with a good amount of acidity for contrast. Sweet and sour—and Maguy is not a fan of sweet and sour! I really pressed her with this one, though. I knew it was going to be a signature dish.\"</p><p>Le Coze decided to have one of her friends try it. \" 'It's very good,' she told me,\" Ripert recalls. \"And I knew she meant it, so that was that.\" Ripert and Le Coze soon landed on a strategy. \"If I have an idea, until Maguy is convinced that my idea is right, we debate it until she is convinced,\" says Ripert. \"The same goes with her ideas. Because of that, no disagreement has ever been frustrating to the point of slamming a door.\"</p><p>Contemplating Le Bernardin's future, Ripert says, \"I think it would be wonderful to see this restaurant go on for 50 more years.\" He entertains the possibility that, when the time comes, he could hand over the keys to longstanding team members.</p><p>But would it still be Le Bernardin?</p><p>Ripert nods, while Le Coze takes a few moments to silently consider the question.</p><p>\"I don't know if I can answer that,\" she says.</p><p>Le Bernardin at 50: Still Going Strong</p>",
