  "title": "Waterfront designers rise to the challenge of flood risk",
  "text": "<p>Gargoyles, the fantastical figures that adorn gothic churches, were not carved into buildings on the whim of eccentric architects; taking their name from the old French word for “throat”, the stone beasts had spouts designed to convey rainwater away from the building to protect its roof, walls and windows.</p> <p>Modern weatherproofing is yet more dramatic. In a coastal part of densely populated South Florida, which is at high risk of flooding, officials have started raising roads. Luxury beachfront homes in the region are on the front line — including a towering new Miami Beach development that will boast a lagoon and tropical garden.</p> <p>Designed by Ateliers Jean Nouvel, the waterside Monad Terrace is nearing completion and comprises 59 condos, priced at $2m-$12.5m. The entrance to the parking garage is elevated 11.5ft, eliminating the need to dig down to the water table, and the building has a waterproofed concrete “bathtub” foundation with reinforced slabs and walls. Whether its surroundings will still be accessible, or habitable, as sea levels rise in decades to come is another question.</p> <p>As the world's climate changes, sea levels rise and the most intense storms become more common, the towns and cities that have developed over centuries are facing new challenges — threats that old buildings were not designed for, and generations of architects did not know to plan for. Urban landscapes are increasingly at risk from flooding.&#xa0;</p> <p>The impact is already being felt: streets are sinking from Venice to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f8f86ca-6af3-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\">Jakarta</a>, and the race is on for low-lying cities to find ways to defend against, or adapt to, encroaching water and heavier downpours. Solutions range from the mundane to the futuristic; from plastic gates and wipe-down floors, to dynamic buildings that rise with floodwater and private floating islands.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Civilisation grew up with an essentially fixed coastline and we've entered a new phase” of long-term change, says Benjamin Strauss, chief scientist at research group Climate Central. “We've not gone from one level to another; we've gone from static to moving.”</p> <p>But, he adds, sea levels will not jump overnight. “With foresight and planning, there are things we can do.”</p> <p><strong>The homes at stake</strong></p> <p>Features of modern towns and cities designed to protect us from the elements, such as smoothly paved roads and concrete roofs, often restrict where water can go. The lack of green spaces that could absorb or store excess water makes urban centres vulnerable; many city dwellers will not be shocked to see overflowing drains during a downpour.</p> <p>The effects of flooding can be devastating. Mary Dhonau's house in Worcester, England, was flooded in 2000. “You can replace a fridge, you can replace a sofa. But I lost my children's little handprints from playgroup,” she says. Dhonau is now a flood resilience campaigner, urging at-risk homeowners to take precautions that could save them thousands in insurance costs and prevent the “emotional toil” of having their homes wrecked.</p> <p>Sea and river defences, such as walls, are an option but can be expensive, be overtopped, and have unintended consequences, such as diverting flooding downstream. As calls for more resilient properties grow louder, specialist architects are rising to the challenge. </p> <p><strong>A non-defensive approach</strong></p> <p>“Learning to live with water” sounds like a soggy compromise. But it is a necessary mantra if the most at-risk places are to survive, researchers say.</p> <p>The array of potential measures is broad and “the right combination of things needs to be adapted very specifically to particular places,” says Jim Hall, professor of climate and environmental risks at the University of Oxford.</p> <p>Avoiding risky locations is the first step. “We shouldn't be building on floodplains, because we're putting people at risk,” said Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. Yet homes do end up in risky areas — thousands are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5480cd42-1a74-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">due to be built</a> on English floodplains alone — particularly when demand is high and space limited.</p> <p>Property-level solutions range from the relatively simple, such as raising the electrics and buying flood insurance, to the extreme: buyers with at least €7.5m can commission a private island from designers Dutch Docklands. The homes, perched on bespoke floats, include outdoor spaces that can be customised with foliage, a pool and a beach.</p> <p>A less flashy alternative is the “Home for All Seasons” designed by UK-based The Environmental Design Studio and architecture practice JTP. Living spaces begin on the first floor, above a ground floor “garden room”. Water and power utilities are located on the first floor, and features include “permeable paving” and a green roof that absorb water.</p> <p>“There's a paucity of exemplar resilient developments, so hopefully we can lift the standards,” says TEDS founder Edward Barsley. “Just because a house is exposed to flooding, doesn't mean it's vulnerable.” The design is in the planning stage at several UK sites, though Barsley did not disclose prices.</p> <p>London-based architecture practice Baca takes a “non-defensive” approach to flooding and designs buildings located on or around water.</p> <p>Its homes are designed to remain intact if the surrounding area is flooded. Early clients have included chief executives and “well-known founders” who want to “live in luxury at the water's edge,” says director Richard Coutts.</p> <p>Baca's projects include the UK's first “amphibious house”, a three-bedroom <a href=\"https://www.baca.uk.com/amphibioushouse.html\">structure </a>situated in a flood zone just metres from the Thames in Buckinghamshire. The house sits on a heavy base in a dock designed to fill with water during a flood, enabling it to rise up to 2 metres. A lightweight superstructure and concrete base were engineered to prevent the house from bobbing around, and extendable cabling means it remains connected as it moves.</p> <p>Baca says the house was about 20 per cent more expensive than a traditional house with a basement, though lengthy discussions with regulatory bodies meant it was “a challenge” to build.</p> <p>Other designs include elevated homes that floodwater can pass underneath, as well as non-residential and mixed-purpose developments. In the US, Baca and its Dutch partner Waterstudio are bidding to bring 138 floating homes to an area of Boston Harbour.</p> <p><strong>Design by community</strong></p> <p>The challenge facing cities with entire districts at risk goes beyond boutique homes and relatively small-scale developments, however.</p> <p>Thinking must evolve from “‘house by house' to ‘how do you rethink community design?'” says Carolyn Kousky, executive director at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Risk Center.</p> <p>For densely populated areas, building defences makes more sense than adding protection to individual homes, says Hall. Alternatives include elevating new-builds, installing citywide flood warning systems and incentivising people to make their homes more resilient.&#xa0;</p> <p>South Florida's geology makes it particularly at risk: its cities, including Miami and Miami Beach, are built on porous limestone, that allows seawater to seep into the rock.</p> <p>Miami-Dade County is home to about 2.7m people, many of whom face increasing flood risk from the sea and from rain, as severe hurricanes in the region become more frequent. A $6bn blueprint to protect the county includes plans to build storm surge barriers, flood-proof thousands of homes and plant mangroves along the shoreline to act as a natural barrier.</p> <p>Nearly 5,000 miles away, the German city of Hamburg is developing a new district that sits on an island in the Elbe river and is at perennial risk of flooding.</p> <p>The option to build a dyke — or defensive barrier — around HafenCity, which would have obscured the river view, was rejected; instead, buildings were elevated on plinths rising 8 metres above sea level. Roads and bridges were built above the flood line, and buildings have flood doors that close whenever the warning system sounds.&#xa0;The development's proximity to the water is what gives the area “much of its charm and identity”, says HafenCity spokeswoman Susanne Bühler. During floods, life continues as normal, she says: “HafenCity is a good example that you don't have to defend against water.”</p> <p><strong>Who pays?</strong></p> <p>A looming question is who pays for it all. Cities have finite resources and face difficult questions about which areas are possible, practically or financially, to protect, says Simon McCarthy from London's Flood Hazard Research Centre. Even then, “there's always residual risk”, he adds: homes are “protected up to a certain point”.</p> <p>Not only do ambitious designs tend to be more expensive, they often require a lengthy planning process. Major retrofit solutions, such as raising an existing house, are also complicated and costly.&#xa0;</p> <p>Resilient design “is more expensive, we just have to acknowledge that”, says Fiona Barbour, chair of the UK Institution of Civil Engineers' floods advisory board, though costs could fall as techniques became more common. She adds that flood-proofing needs to be practical: the future of urban design is not simply “a whole lot of houses on stilts”.</p> <p>However, housebuilders that build at scale are unlikely to overhaul their methods before demand for more resilient homes is widespread, or governments impose more resilient standards.&#xa0;</p> <p>Individuals can do their bit, such as by raising their electrics. But not everyone knows to do so: many people assume that homes far from the water are safe from flooding, unaware that floodplains can stretch out for miles, says Cloke.<br><br><strong>The lure of the water</strong></p> <p>Despite the multitude of growing threats Miami is facing, the region is booming: prices continue to rise, new seafront developments are going up, and Florida's population rose by more than 200,000 in the year to July 2020.</p> <p>What is expected to become the city's tallest tower, just metres from the sea, is under construction. The $1bn, nearly 320-metre Waldorf Astoria Miami will house 400 apartments and a hotel.</p> <p>“We've never had so many sales, we've never had so little inventory,” says Rosalind Clarke, a Palm Beach estate agent who works with Christie's International Real Estate.&#xa0;Buyers come for the warm weather, sea views and amenities, she says. “Everybody wants to be here. They overlook some of these other things that maybe in another market would be relevant.”</p> <p>Charles Waldheim, from Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, says South Florida is “not a place where you would locate a city for any rational reason”. The things keeping people there — the region's character, culture and heritage — are fragile, and the solutions required to keep South Florida intact may eventually erode “the meaning of the place”, he says.</p> <p>In Miami Beach, the hard work of raising roads is under way. Elsewhere, for example in parts of the UK and the US state of Louisiana deemed too challenging to protect, the first managed evacuations are taking place.</p> <p>As for Miami, Climate Central's Strauss says money will keep flowing into the city as long as investors believe they can profit from developing property there, even as the risks increase.</p> <p>“There's physical reality and there's perceived reality”, and both are likely to change as climate change accelerates, he says. “It strikes me as a frail system that may collapse.”</p> <p><em>Camilla Hodgson is an FT climate reporter</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
