  "title": "Biden Order Targets Big Business --- Sweeping proposal to spur competition likely sets up heated battles with top companies",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden's effort isn't a mandate but instead a road map that encourages agencies to adopt policies that push back against corporate consolidation and business practices that might stifle competition and lead to higher prices and fewer product choices.</p><p>The eventual rules and regulations that follow from the White House's direction are likely to set up heated battles with top U.S. companies that could take years to resolve.</p><p>\"Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism. It's exploitation,\" Mr. Biden said before signing the order.</p><p>The president's move, months in the making, comes as Democrats have made competition policy and antitrust enforcement a key part of their agenda, arguing that the federal government hasn't done enough to preserve healthy, competitive markets.</p><p>Republicans have agreed in some circumstances, particularly in the tech sector, but they, along with some business groups, have disputed arguments that the U.S. has extensive problems with economic concentration. They contend the Biden administration is starting from a faulty premise and risks making the U.S. economy less productive as a result.</p><p>\"We are concerned about the breadth of issues contemplated in and potential implications of the Executive Order that could undermine rather than enhance U.S. competitiveness,\" said Joshua Bolten, president and CEO of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers.</p><p>The order's targeting of the technology industry jeopardizes \"free services that consumers use to message and call loved ones, get directions, connect with healthcare professionals, consume online content -- including news and educational content -- and much more,\" said TechNet, a group that represents senior industry executives.</p><p>Others in the business world stand to benefit if the Biden administration follows through on the president's order, and small-business groups, merchants and farmers all voiced support for it.</p><p>The American Farm Bureau Federation said the president's plan creates opportunities to address industry imbalances. \"More opportunities for farmers and ranchers to sell their products will ensure they are paid fairly while providing more options for America's families,\" said Zippy Duvall, the group's president.</p><p>In total, Mr. Biden's plan offers a mix of new ideas, an affirmation of some initiatives already in the works, and a bid to revive some measures Democrats had proposed in the past.</p><p>Among the White House's targets are agriculture, healthcare, shipping, transportation and technology, as well as labor practices that the administration says limit wages and mobility.</p><p>Mr. Biden's order by itself doesn't impose new requirements on the business community. The success of the White House effort could depend on how hard -- and how quickly -- government agencies push to implement his competition policies, which are likely to face court challenges.</p><p>The Biden administration initiative follows a similar effort by the Obama White House during its last year. That effort resulted in a handful of new rules before the Trump administration reversed some of the measures.</p><p>The new order places a diverse set of initiatives under one roof and is more explicit in pushing government agencies to take detailed steps to protect competition. It also comes at the beginning of a presidential term, giving Mr. Biden's appointees more time to align their priorities and implement regulations.</p><p>A key architect of the order was Tim Wu, special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy in the White House National Economic Council. An academic before joining the White House in March, Mr. Wu wrote books and papers arguing that large American corporations hold too much market power and that numerous federal agencies could deploy their authority to help boost competition.</p><p>Work began on the order in earnest after Mr. Wu arrived at the White House in March, a senior White House official said. Mr. Wu and other staff reached out to regulatory agencies to solicit ideas about what to include in the order -- and suggested some of their own, the official said.</p><p>The executive order also touches on issues Mr. Biden has highlighted for years and on the campaign trail, including the use of noncompete clauses to limit workers' mobility. Friday, he called out clauses preventing workers from moving between hamburger-chain restaurants: \"Come on, is there a trade secret about what's inside that patty?\"</p><p>Several pieces of the executive order could provide a springboard for plans already being formulated at some government agencies, especially the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department.</p><p>The order encourages the FTC to write first-ever rules barring certain types of allegedly anticompetitive practices including \"unfair competition in major internet marketplaces,\" according to the White House. Mr. Biden's new head of the FTC, Lina Khan, has previously voiced support for such efforts. They are likely to spark a partisan battle on the five-member commission, as Democrats and Republicans disagree on the extent of the agency's legal authority.</p><p>The executive order also encourages the FTC to regulate large technology platforms by establishing rules on \"unfair data collection and surveillance practices.\"</p><p>Taken together, the tech-related provisions foreshadow a regulatory push by the FTC to limit the market power of large technology companies -- one that could seek to regulate how Amazon.com Inc. runs its e-marketplace and Apple Inc. runs its app store, as well as data collection practices by the likes of Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>Big tech companies, which are also facing efforts in Congress to rein them in, have vigorously disputed allegations that their size and conduct are anticonsumer and anticompetitive, saying they have provided highly popular products and services at no or low costs.</p><p>Some of the congressional efforts would go further than the executive order, for instance by breaking apart large tech companies. New laws also have more staying power than executive orders.</p><p>---</p><p>Inside the Order</p><p>Hearing aids, airline-baggage fees, prescription drugs, DIY cellphone repairs and \"Product of USA\" labels: President Biden's executive order on big business and competition targets an array of industries and touches on a range of products and services.</p><p>Here are some of the key points outlined in the order:</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>-- Calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a plan within 45 days to combat high prescription-drug prices.</p><p>-- Calls for HHS to consider rules within 120 days to allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter.</p><p>-- Directs the Food and Drug Administration to help expedite imports of prescription drugs from Canada.</p><p>-- Encourages the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to revise guidelines for hospital mergers and calls for HHS to support hospital price transparency rules and address surprise hospital billing.</p><p>-- Calls on HHS to help people comparison shop for health insurance more easily by standardizing plan options in the National Health Insurance Marketplace.</p><p>Internet Services</p><p>-- Encourages the Federal Communications Commission to prevent internet service providers from making deals with landlords that limit tenants' choices for broadband services, requires service providers to report prices and rates to the FCC, and limits early termination fees.</p><p>-- Encourages the FCC to restore \"net neutrality\" rules undone by the Trump administration.</p><p>Big Tech</p><p>-- Pledges greater scrutiny of mergers by dominant internet platforms and the acquisition of smaller competitors.</p><p>-- Urges the FTC to establish rules on large platforms' use of surveillance and gathering of user data.</p><p>-- Urges the FTC to create rules \"barring unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces\" that could harm smaller businesses.</p><p>-- Encourages the FTC to curb cellphone manufacturers' restrictions against the use of independent repair shops or do-it-yourself repairs for devices.</p><p>Labor</p><p>-- Encourages the FTC to ban or limit the use of noncompete clauses and occupational licensing restrictions to limit workers' mobility.</p><p>-- Encourages the FTC and the Justice Department to limit employers' ability to share wage and benefits data \"to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits.\"</p><p>Transportation and Shipping</p><p>-- Urges the Transportation Department to issue rules requiring refunds of fees when airline baggage is delayed or when services like in-flight Wi-Fi or entertainment systems don't work or aren't provided.</p><p>-- Urges the Surface Transportation Board to require freight railroad track owners to provide rights of way to passenger rail.</p><p>-- Urges the Federal Maritime Commission to help rein in \"detention and demurrage\" fees that foreign shipping companies use against American exporters for time their freight waits to be loaded or unloaded.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>-- Urges the U.S. Department of Agriculture to consider stricter rules for when meat can use \"Product of USA\" labels.</p><p>-- Urges the FTC to limit farm-equipment manufacturers from restricting farmers' ability to use independent repair shops or make do-it-yourself repairs on equipment such as tractors.</p><p>Banking and Finance</p><p>-- Urges the Justice Department and other agencies to update guidelines on banking mergers and bolster scrutiny of those mergers.</p><p>-- Encourages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to implement rules to allow banking customers to transfer their financial data from one bank to another.</p>",
