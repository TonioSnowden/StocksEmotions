  "title": "'Revolver Special Edition' Review: The Beatles' Best; The innovative 1966 album is rarely ranked at the top of the band's output, but an expanded new release—with a revelatory stereo mix—suggests it ought to be",
  "text": "<p>The new \"Revolver Special Edition,\" released by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe on Oct. 28, makes a solid case for that reconsideration. The latest in a series of Beatles remixes and archival boxes, it is available in several LP, CD and digital configurations, the most comprehensive being a five-disc Super Deluxe edition, which includes a new stereo mix by Giles Martin and Sam Okell; the 1966 mono mix; 31 outtakes, demos and oddities; new and original mixes of the contemporaneous single's two sides, \"Paperback Writer\" and \"Rain.\" Also included is a 100-page book with detailed annotations by Kevin Howlett; essays by Paul McCartney, Mr. Martin and Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson; and the wealth of illustrations (handwritten lyrics, session documents and photos of the band at work) that have become standard in these sets. </p><p>The newfound love for \"Revolver\" is probably rooted in a belated realization of how revolutionary the album was, something that may have been obscured by the appearance of \"Sgt. Pepper\" only 10 months later. But where virtually all the Beatles' compositions through its predecessor, \"Rubber Soul,\" were love songs, much of \"Revolver\" finds its subject matter elsewhere. Here, the Beatles complain about excessive taxation (in George Harrison's \"Taxman\"), describe intense loneliness (in Mr. McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\"), muse about the pleasures of daydreaming (in John Lennon's \"I'm Only Sleeping\") and explore the intersection of life, death and drugs (in Lennon's \"She Said She Said\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"). </p><p>There are love songs, too, including two of Mr. McCartney's most magnificent creations, \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One,\" and Harrison's Hindustani-tinged \"Love You To.\" But mostly, \"Revolver\" is a parade of odd characters like Rigby and Father McKenzie, the pill-dispensing \"Doctor Robert\" and the partying crew of \"Yellow Submarine.\" </p><p>Musically, \"Revolver\" captured the Beatles at their best as a self-contained band: Listen to the airtight ensemble in \"Doctor Robert,\" \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" and \"Got to Get You Into My Life,\" and to the exquisite vocal harmonies on most tracks. Yet they also expanded to embrace a string octet, Stax-style brass, Indian instruments and structures, and a solo turn by the great hornist Alan Civil, as well as experimentation with tape loops, backward guitar and vocal sounds and variations in recording speeds that yielded unusual instrumental timbres. </p><p>The Beatles' ideas here pushed the limits of EMI's four-track recording equipment, and limited what their producer, George Martin, could do when making stereo mixes, particularly in cases where the drums, bass and rhythm guitar were recorded onto a single tape track. Enter the artificial intelligence de-mixing technology developed by director Peter Jackson's sound crew during the making of last year's \"Get Back\" documentary. This system allowed Mr. Jackson to separate instruments, voices and background noise from a mono recording, and it has improved since then: Now it can separate the components of Ringo Starr's drum kit.</p><p>The new Martin-Okell mix is masterly—warmer, more solid and better balanced than the 1966 mix. In the original version of \"Eleanor Rigby,\" the strings were centered and Mr. McCartney's lead vocal was off to the right. Now the vocal is centered and the strings are placed as they would be on stage—violins to the left, cellos to the right, violas centered. In \"Yellow Submarine,\" the guitar chord supporting Mr. Starr's opening vocal, present in the mono mix but absent in stereo, has been restored, and the special effects travel across the soundstage, as do the tape loops in \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" Throughout the album guitar textures are grittier, and bass and drums have greater presence and depth. </p><p>A handful of the outtakes were available (albeit in different mixes) on \"Anthology 2\" (1996), but among the new delights is a high-energy early mix of \"Got to Get You Into My Life\" in which guitars take the lines later overdubbed by saxophones and trumpets. A lovely early rendering of \"Here, There and Everywhere\" has an irresistible transparency, and a demo of \"Yellow Submarine\" shows that the song, long thought to be a McCartney children's tune, started out as a darkly introspective Lennon composition, beginning with the line, \"In the place where I was born, no one cared, no one cared.\" Dropped verses and alternative arrangements further illuminate the band's creative process. </p><p>The Beatles' remix series has engendered debate among collectors, with some contending that the original mixes are sacrosanct. Those mixes remain available for those who feel that way. But if you make a playlist with the 1966 and 2022 mixes interspersed, and listen with headphones, the improvements the new mixes offer will be immediately apparent. </p><p>Mr. Kozinn writes about music for the Journal. His new book \"The McCartney Legacy, Vol. 1, 1969-1973\" (Dey Street/HarperColllins), co-authored with Adrian Sinclair, is out Dec. 13.</p><p>'Revolver Special Edition' Review: The Beatles' Best</p>",
