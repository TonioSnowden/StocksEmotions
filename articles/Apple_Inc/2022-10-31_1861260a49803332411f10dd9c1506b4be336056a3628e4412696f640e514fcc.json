  "text": "<p>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/979d9f22-eb96-46a8-a8c8-31e1cb452091\">completed a remarkable political comeback</a>, defeating populist incumbent rightwing leader Jair Bolsonaro by less than two percentage points after a bitter campaign marred by fake news and violence.</p> <p>The leftist former president won 50.9 per cent of the vote versus 49.1 for Bolsonaro after a cliffhanger three-hour count, followed by millions across the country on television and online. In total, Lula won 60.3mn votes, just over 2mn more than Bolsonaro.</p> <p>In a speech after the vote count the 77-year-old former trade unionist addressed the deep divisions that surfaced during the campaign. “We no longer want to fight. We're tired of seeing the other as the enemy,” he told his supporters.</p> <p>Lula supporters took to the streets after the result was made public, shouting his name from apartment windows, honking horns and letting off fireworks. But had it not been for a series of blunders by Bolsonaro and his supporters in the final days of the campaign, including one of his allies videoed brandishing a pistol in São Paulo in pursuit of a black man, the far-right president could have won a second term. </p> <p>Bolsonaro, who has yet to concede defeat, repeatedly made claims in the run-up to the vote that Brazil's electronic ballot machines were vulnerable to fraud, leading opponents to fear he was preparing a justification to reject a losing result. He also claimed in recent days that rulings from the country's electoral court had prejudiced his campaign.</p> <p>But the victory caps a remarkable turnround for Lula, who served as president between 2003 and 2010, but was later accused of corruption and served time in prison for graft before his convictions were annulled.</p> <p>He will take office on January 1 but faces a deeply divided nation and obstacles in Congress, which is broadly right-leaning. He has offered few details of his economic programme, choosing instead to focus on the risks to democracy from Bolsonaro's far-right movement, framing the election as a choice between “democracy and fascism, democracy and barbarism”. </p> <p>He also took aim at the nation's high levels of poverty and hunger during his re-election campaign and pledged to abolish a constitutional spending cap to allow the government to spend more on social projects and infrastructure, unnerving some investors.</p> <p>On the environment, Lula has pledged to end illegal deforestation of the Amazon, following a surge in destruction of the earth's largest rainforest under Bolsonaro.</p> <p>US president Joe Biden and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron were among the first world leaders to congratulate Lula as well as China's foreign ministry and Vladimir Putin. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The tight result is a reminder of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/571b7861-c0a9-446f-a5da-651c79090ffe\">how profoundly Brazil has changed</a> over the past two decades, writes Latin America editor Michael Stott.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Wheat and corn futures rise after Russia withdraws from trade deal </strong>Wheat and corn futures traded in Chicago <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5360ee8-3299-40dc-b06d-7908de12e266\">jumped today</a> following Russia's withdrawal from a UN-backed deal that allowed the passage of millions of tonnes of grain through the Black Sea. On Saturday the Kremlin suspended its participation in the deal with Kyiv, blaming a weekend attack on ships in a port within territory annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Meanwhile, a series of explosions have rocked the Ukrainian capital this morning.

The deployment comes as the US and Australia seek to work more closely together to counter Chinese activity, particularly near Taiwan.</p> <p><strong>3. Hong Kong to explore legalising retail crypto trades </strong>Hong Kong is taking steps <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86ac5369-f78e-4fe6-8757-650fb4350fd2\">towards legalising retail trading of crypto assets</a>, in a reversal that contrasts Beijing's crackdown on such transactions in mainland China. The Chinese territory's regulators are also exploring the listing of crypto exchange traded funds, Hong Kong's financial authorities said earlier today.</p> <p><strong>4. Apple's supply chain tested as Covid hits iPhone assembler Foxconn</strong> Foxconn, Apple's main iPhone assembler in China, said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26dbb37d-ad33-4691-a437-caeba7b2a5c9\">it was preparing to shift production</a> to other parts of the country as masses of workers fled its main production hub over the weekend to escape a worsening Covid outbreak. Local officials today continued to bus workers away from the Zhengzhou plant, where staff say the company has failed to provide adequate food and a safe working environment during Apple's peak production period.</p> <p><strong>5. Elon Musk moves quickly to shake up Twitter</strong> The new owner of Twitter has set plans in motion <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e80b0213-d9d4-427d-94d5-4d9aedf17bc8\">for broad lay-offs at the social media company</a>, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk is not seeking a fixed percentage of lay-offs from Twitter's 7,500-strong workforce but wants to remove those who do not support him as leader, according to one person.&#xa0;</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>US Supreme Court</strong> <strong>to consider use of race in college admissions</strong> The highest court in the US hears from “anti-affirmative action activists” seeking to bar Harvard University and the University of North Carolina from considering race in undergraduate admissions.

But China's Made in China 2025 programme, announced seven years ago, spelt out the country's desire to be free of western technology, paving the way for a formal supply chain decoupling.</p> <p><strong>Meta shareholders vent anger at Zuckerberg's spending binge</strong> Meta's shares tumbled 25 per cent last week after the company revealed that losses from Reality Labs, its division that is building the metaverse, would grow “significantly” in 2023. The anger <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4c676c-56a6-4b5e-850f-ddb78f9feb40\">has spilled over into meetings between management and investors</a>, some of which Zuckerberg has attended personally. “If any other company had done this you'd have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change,” said one investor.</p> <p><strong>Russia and Ukraine prepare for rigours of winter war</strong> Winter has played a major role in Russian and Ukrainian military history. It was decisive in their victories over Napoleon and Nazi Germany, and in what Kyiv-born writer Mikhail Bulgakov called that “great and terrible year” of 1918. More than a century later the weather is set to be a critical factor again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14ea4d75-b273-4a89-8a3f-c7708881673b\">as the fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces enters its ninth month</a>.</p> <p><strong>OECD tax chief warns of trade wars</strong> Pascal Saint-Amans, who masterminded the most radical reforms to corporate taxation in almost a century, says the US and Europe risk reviving trade wars and face hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd64cff6-3fa8-4c44-8eb1-069b4a7e0d96\">if they fail to implement last year's global deal</a> to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. “I see some serious risks of unilateral measures,” he told the Financial Times.</p> <p><strong>European consumers tighten their belts </strong>In the latest evidence of mounting strain on the region's economy, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b26e11b4-feb5-4c68-a742-f41c114fab03\">European consumers have begun to cut back on spending</a> as rising energy bills and interest rates push up the cost of living. Consumer sentiment has dropped sharply and car sales, box office revenues and hotel bookings are all falling.</p> <p><strong>Netanyahu plots return to power </strong>With tomorrow's election in Israel on a knife edge, former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db4cdf6a-8f6c-4de8-8263-32eff42fae8f\">Benjamin Netanyahu's chances are likely to depend on the far right</a>. This will be Israel's fifth election in three-and-a-half years of political gridlock and is widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, a polarising figure who has been the country's leader for 15 of the past 26 years.</p> <h1>Travel</h1> <p>Escape to Egypt and Italy via Jamaica and Bhutan, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8922063a-c68d-4424-a4dc-2f64105e905e\">in the HTSI travel issue 2022</a>. </p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones, Sophia Smith and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: Lula completes triumphant comeback' FT.com 31 October.
