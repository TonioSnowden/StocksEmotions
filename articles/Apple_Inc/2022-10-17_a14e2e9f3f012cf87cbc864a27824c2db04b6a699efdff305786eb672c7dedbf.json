This month's deal is on the Malibu LT.</p><p>MSRP: $26,800 Lease offer: $4,019 down and $259/month for 24 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>2. 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer</p><p>The 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer is another subcompact SUV that has the driving manners of a nimble economy car — and the fuel-sipping habits of one too. This 2-year lease on the LT happens to include the optional 155-hp turbocharged 3-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. It's available to current lessees of any 2017 or newer vehicle.</p><p>MSRP: $27,495 Lease offer: $3,839 down and $269/month for 24 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>3. 2022 Honda Civic</p><p>Nimble and entertaining to drive, the 2022 Honda Civic Sport sedan is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a lot of car for their money.

The cabin is spacious, and an updated suspension provides a more cossetting ride than before. Behind the split-folding rear seatback, there are approximately 24 cubic feet of cargo room. This month's deal is on the 2WD Sport.</p><p>MSRP: $25,650 Lease offer: $3,799 down and $249/month for 36 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>Be sure to read: 'Lease offers are horrible.'

Here's your guide to shopping for an electric car.</p><p>6. 2023 Kia K5</p><p>The 2023 Kia K5 is a midsize sedan that is practical but adds some sportiness and emotion to the equation. It has crisp styling, an interior loaded with standard features, and a starting price lower than many of this Kia's KR:000270 competitors. The infotainment system is highly intuitive, and every K5 comes standard with wireless smartphone connectivity, automatic high-beam headlights, and lane-keeping assistance. This month's deal is on the LXS.</p><p>MSRP: $25,090 Lease offer: $3,636 down and $269/month for 24 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>7. 2023 Kia Soul</p><p>The 2023 Kia Soul is a fun and funky little people mover that packs loads of passenger and cargo space into tiny proportions.

This lease is for the Soul LX trim level.</p><p>MSRP: $19,790 Lease offer: $2,799 down and $239/month for 36 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>You might like: The outlook for used car prices is improving—some types more than others</p><p>8. 2023 Mazda CX-5</p><p>From the perspective of the driver's seat, the cabin of the 2023 Mazda CX-5 looks and feels like it belongs to a much pricier SUV. Not only does this Mazda MZDAY exude quality, but it also drives with agility and verve, especially when zipping around tight corners. A 187-horsepower 4-cylinder is the entry-level engine, though a turbo 4-cylinder is optional. All-wheel drive is now standard on every CX-5 trim. This month's deal is on the 2.5 S.</p><p>MSRP: $26,700 Lease offer: $2,999 down and $299/month for 36 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>9. 2023 Subaru Crosstrek</p><p>With its standard all-wheel drive and bulldog-like stance, the 2023 Subaru FUJHY Crosstrek exudes an adventurous image. What separates the Crosstrek from its rivals is how smoothly it rides and how its smaller proportions allow it to squeeze into snug parking spots (or down narrow wilderness trails). This lease applies to the entry-level version of the Crosstrek, fitted with a 155-hp flat 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed manual or automatic gearbox.</p><p>MSRP: $23,645 Lease offer: $2,575 down and $275/month for 36 months Expires: Oct. 31, 2022</p><p>See: The 2023 Subaru Crosstrek: The quirky little SUV is a sensible car that's not afraid to get dirty</p><p>10. 2022 Toyota Corolla</p><p>Among small sedans, the 2022 Toyota TM Corolla maintains a reputation for reliability and affordability.
