  "text": "<p>Participating in the \"instant runoff\" requires predicting in advance which candidates will make it to the final round of tabulation. By contrast, in a traditional runoff election voters can compare the final two head to head.</p><p>The strategy of RCV is far more complicated and consequential than deciding among moose burgers, halibut and salmon for dinner.</p><p>Sarah Montalbano</p><p>Bozeman, Mont.</p><p>Ms. Montalbano was a Robert L. Bartley Fellow at the Journal.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Strassel writes that before RCV Alaska had a \"perfectly good election system.\" I beg to differ. In Alaska's old system, like the current one in Pennsylvania, the general-election candidates are decided in partisan primaries by a small number of extreme voters. That is why in the current Pennsylvania Senate race we get to choose between a MAGA candidate and a socialist, neither of which appeals to me.</p><p>In a ranked-choice system, Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, and David McCormick, a moderate Republican would be on the ballot, and they would be my first two choices. There is a learning curve when changing systems, but we will get better choices.</p><p>Richard Abraham</p><p>Havertown, Pa.</p>",
