  "title": "Bench, Nether Edge, Sheffield: ‘The staff are disorientingly friendly' — restaurant review",
  "text": "<p>I have an ill-concealed obsession with architecture, so when I got the tip-off about Bench in Sheffield, I thought immediately of the modernist glory of the city's Hyde Park Flats and one of the few post-industrial town centres in the UK that somehow deserves the American term “downtown”. I was expecting “urban” and, laden as I am with prejudices about northern cities, I extrapolated Nether Edge to be as it sounds — a bit Nether, a bit Edge. I was not quite expecting the sedate glory of grand old houses and gently winding, tree-lined streets.</p> <p>Bench is part of a bijou rank of shops in a residential suburb. Inside, there's an open kitchen along one wall which ever-so-slightly bespeaks the kebab shop. A single large tall table fills the centre of the room; there is high bench seating in the windows and a few two-tops.</p> <p>The staff are, to anyone used&#xa0;to London service, disorientingly friendly. It's the defining characteristic of the place. (No . . . He's not being sarcastic . . . He genuinely wants you to have a lovely&#xa0;evening.)</p> <p>It's immediately recognisable as a small-plate-natural-wines operation, but, thank God, nobody feels moved to explain the fact to you as you sit down.</p> <p>We were two professionals and had carefully husbanded our appetites so we could order both wide and deep, and so took the “smoked Rebel noix ham” as a preliminary loosener. Our waiter explained it was an artisanal ham of abiding loveliness, shipped from Brighton — and also that, due to it selling out, it was now a salami from the same supplier. It was very good. Strong flavours, well-kept, fudgy consistency. I was only mildly perturbed that it had travelled so far to a region that's chock-a-block with artisanal meat-fettlers of its own.</p> <p>I must have had “gnocco fritto, mortadella”, in one guise or another, four times in the past month. It's always pretty good, but it's fascinating the speed with which trends now spread. I know little about fast rail links, but the time taken for a menu idea to propagate between suburban Sheffield and Shoreditch is now so small as to be statistically insignificant. Ideas are effectively nationwide in the time it takes to Instagram a menu. The gnocchi were a tad heavier than I've had elsewhere, but that wouldn't stop me necking another eight of them if you stuck the plate in front of me right now.</p> <p>The “coronation chicken skewer” was a beautifully crafted take on the old favourite, with the creamy curry sauce sort of upcycled into a marinade/glaze. It sat amicably alongside some “duck fat potatoes”, roasted The Proper Way, without preliminary boiling, so their outers were a little leathery as well as crisp and the innards steamed and fluffed. Aioli was the lubricant supplied and it elevated the spuds to glory.</p> <p>Puntarelle is obviously in fashion as much as it is in season, so perhaps it's not confirmation bias that, like the mortadella, I see it popping up everywhere. The kitchen absolutely aced the garlicky “alla Romana” presentation though.</p> <p>A lot of skill and judgment went into the “steamed mussels, smoked bone broth, mushrooms and herbs” with the shellfish lightly poached in a strong broth and with just enough fishiness to lead perfectly into a monumental rare breed pork chop, served with scorched cabbage, apple mostarda and sauce charcutière.</p> <p>I find it fascinating that this kind of internationally influenced menu, these new classic dishes and the small-plate-and-natural-wine idiom have spread so widely. I'm glad they have found their places where once might have stood a decent trattoria or much-loved cod-Provençal bistro in desirable residential areas of town. Like a lot of small out-of-the-centre indies, Bench is pitching itself as a “neighbourhood” restaurant. What is unique is that it might make me consider moving to the&#xa0;neighbourhood.</p> <p>I'm always nervous, when reviewing “north”, of coming across like Dr Johnson when he said “ . . . like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all,” and that is emphatically not what I mean. I'm not surprised it's being done in Sheffield. I'm just very glad it's being done so well.</p> <p><em>Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timhayward\"><em>@TimHayward</em></a><em> and email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=tim.hayward@ft.com\"><em>tim.hayward@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Tim Hayward 2022 'Bench, Nether Edge, Sheffield: ‘The staff are disorientingly friendly' — restaurant review' FT.com 10 February.
