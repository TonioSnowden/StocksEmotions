  "title": "Theranos's Holmes Found Guilty  ---  Onetime Silicon Valley  star convicted on four  of 11 counts in federal  investor-fraud case  ----  By Sara Randazzo, Heather Somerville and Christopher Weaver",
  "text": "<p>   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A federal jury convicted Elizabeth Holmes, the startup founder who claimed to revolutionize blood testing, on four of 11 charges that she conducted a yearslong fraud scheme against investors while running Theranos Inc., which ended up as one of Silicon Valley's most notorious implosions. </p><p>   The verdict caps a steep fall for the former Silicon Valley star who once graced magazine covers with headlines such as \"This CEO Is Out for Blood\" and emulated Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs by wearing black turtlenecks. </p><p>   At the 15-week trial, Ms. Holmes testified in her own defense, showing regret for missteps and saying she never intended to mislead anyone. She accused her former boyfriend and deputy at Theranos of abusing her, allegations he has denied. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes said nothing when she left the courthouse following the verdict, ignoring questions from journalists. Her attorneys declined to comment on the jury's decision or any plans to appeal. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes was charged with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud under an indictment brought 3 1/2 years ago. She was found guilty on three of the fraud counts and one of the conspiracy counts. </p><p>   She was acquitted on four counts related to defrauding patients -- one charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and three charges of wire fraud. </p><p>   The jurors failed to reach a verdict on three counts related to investors, after saying earlier Monday they were having difficulty reaching consensus on those charges. </p><p>   The 12 jurors looked impassively at the judge's deputy, Adriana Kratzmann, as she read the verdicts aloud. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes, 37 years old, embraced her family and friends, who attended throughout the trial, before departing the courtroom. She looked composed after the verdict was read and lawyers discussed the bond she would be held under while staying out of prison until sentencing. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes exited the courthouse with her partner, hotel heir Billy Evans, and her parents, all holding hands. They were mobbed by camera crews as they walked about a block to the San Jose hotel where they had been staying. </p><p>   Stephanie Hinds, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, said jurors in the 15-week trial \"navigated a complex case\" amid a pandemic and scheduling obstacles. \"The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes's culpability in this large-scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,\" she said. </p><p>   It is all but certain Ms. Holmes will appeal, a process that can take years. </p><p>   Prosecutors can choose to pursue a new trial on the undecided counts, though legal experts said such a path would be unlikely. The timing of any new action by the U.S. against Ms. Holmes would likely be affected by an upcoming trial of her ex-boyfriend and the former chief operating officer, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani. Mr. Balwani faces similar charges of defrauding investors and patients about the startup's blood-testing capabilities, which he denies. </p><p>   Prosecutors had to prove she intended to defraud investors and patients, seeking a financial windfall. Ms. Holmes countered with testimony saying she made innocent mistakes and believed that Theranos's blood-testing technology was showing signs of success. </p><p>   Jurors were persuaded that Ms. Holmes conspired to defraud investors. This could be significant because it means the hundreds of millions of dollars Theranos investors lost could all be taken into consideration during her sentencing. The jury was split, however, on which of the six investors who testified were defrauded. </p><p>   The jurors convicted Ms. Holmes on the three counts related to the largest investments. These included about $100 million from a family office of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, $38 million from PFM Health Sciences LP, a hedge fund that invested $96 million in Theranos and recovered $43 million in a civil lawsuit; and $6 million from Daniel Mosley, a former estate lawyer who connected Theranos to his wealthy clients. </p><p>   The jury wasn't fully convinced by testimony from other investors who said they had invested even after Ms. Holmes rebuffed their requests for more information, which defense lawyers said showed negligence on their part. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes was exonerated on all accounts related to patients. Testimony from the three patients who received what they called false test results was limited. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes could face up to 20 years in prison for each count for which she was found guilty, but former prosecutors said such a stiff sentence is rare in white-collar fraud cases. That Ms. Holmes was acquitted of some charges likely lessens the overall penalty she will face, former prosecutors said. Sentencing will follow. </p><p>   There is no mandatory minimum sentence for the counts she was convicted of. </p><p>   The U.S. government, in a rare fraud prosecution of a technology executive, essentially put on trial Silicon Valley's fake-it-until-you-make-it culture. In Theranos's case, prosecutors said Ms. Holmes's hype and hubris went far beyond norms, exposing patients and investors to harm by peddling faulty technology. </p><p>   \"She chose to be dishonest with her investors and with patients,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Schenk said of Ms. Holmes in his closing arguments. \"That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.\" </p><p>   The mixed verdict, by a jury of four women and eight men, put a punctuation mark on a scandal that surfaced with a series of Wall Street Journal articles in 2015 and 2016 that called into question Theranos's proprietary blood-testing technology. </p><p>   In 2018, Ms. Holmes settled separate civil securities-fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission; she paid a $500,000 penalty and was banned from being an officer or director of any public company for 10 years, without admitting or denying the allegations. </p><p>   Theranos rose out of an idea Ms. Holmes dreamed up as a 19-year-old student at Stanford University. She sought to upend the blood-testing business by developing technology that tested for a range of health conditions with just a few drops of blood from a finger prick, eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes recruited a star-studded board of Washington insiders, including former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, who knew little about healthcare but were drawn in by her vision and conviction about Theranos's prospects. </p><p>   At its peak, investors valued Theranos at more than $9 billion, the 10th-largest among venture-capital-backed startup companies. Ms. Holmes owned half of it, with a paper value of around $4.5 billion, she testified during her trial. The company employed hundreds of scientists, engineers and marketers, and Ms. Holmes claimed it could cheaply and quickly run more than 200 health tests using a proprietary device. In a partnership, Theranos offered the tests at Walgreens pharmacies. </p><p>   The trial showed a different reality. The company managed to use its proprietary finger-prick blood-testing device for just 12 types of patient tests. Those results were unreliable. At its lab, Theranos secretly ran most of its blood tests on commercial devices from other companies, including some that Theranos altered to work with tiny blood samples. </p><p>   In her testimony, Ms. Holmes repeatedly said she had regret for some of her business decisions: \"There are many things that I wish I did differently,\" she said. </p><p>   She insisted, however, that she never set out to defraud anyone: \"I believed in the company, and I wanted to put everything that I had into it.\" </p><p>   The government called 29 witnesses in its effort to prove Ms. Holmes committed fraud. They included former Theranos employees who recounted how Ms. Holmes and her deputy dismissed warnings about questionable test results from the company's lab while creating a culture of fear, isolation and retaliation. </p><p>   Jurors learned during the trial that Ms. Holmes forged reports provided to some investors and partners such as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s U.S. drugstore unit by adding logos of Pfizer Inc. and other major drug companies without permission from the companies. </p><p>   Woven together, the evidence illustrated a startup that encountered numerous challenges and masked its problems to try to stay afloat. All the while, Ms. Holmes was in charge. Asked by a prosecutor if the buck stopped with her, Ms. Holmes replied, \"I felt that.\" </p><p>   Investors took the stand to describe how Ms. Holmes made what they later concluded had been misleading sales pitches, falsely claiming Theranos devices were being used by the military and that the company was on track to make nearly $1 billion in annual revenue in 2015. They said Ms. Holmes's marketing effort persuaded them to sink millions of dollars into the company. </p><p>   Patients described receiving test results they believed were simply wrong. One result indicated that a woman could be HIV-positive; another wrongly led a pregnant woman to believe she was miscarrying. </p><p>   In the trial's most dramatic turn, Ms. Holmes made a bold gamble to testify on her own behalf. Projecting confidence, smiling at times and maintaining her composure, Ms. Holmes said she had honest intentions to improve healthcare but conceded to mistakes and obfuscations. She said Mr. Balwani forced her to have sex against her will and directed her to adopt a punishing lifestyle of little sleep or time with family and friends. </p><p>   A lawyer for Mr. Balwani denied the allegations, calling the abuse claims \"devastating personally to him.\" He faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy and has pleaded not guilty. His trial is set for February. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Meghan Bobrowsky contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
