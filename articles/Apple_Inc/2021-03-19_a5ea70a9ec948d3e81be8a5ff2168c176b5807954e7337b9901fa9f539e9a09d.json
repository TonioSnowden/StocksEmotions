  "text": "<p>   Justus Dillon, a resident of Hattiesburg, Miss., had never been to New York City before. But she recently decided to join a friend for a first-ever trip. </p><p>   \"I'm loving the city so far,\" said the 19-year-old, as she took in the scene from Times Square earlier this week. She added that \"even the small things have been cool . . . Like the subway. I never rode a subway before.\" </p><p>   After a pandemic-ravaged year in which tourists largely stopped coming to New York, the city is starting to see an uptick in visitors, according to various sources. STR, a data firm that tracks the hospitality industry, said the city's hotel occupancy reached 47% for the week that ended March 13, the highest weekly figure since last June. </p><p>   The Times Square Alliance, a nonprofit group, reports an increase in foot traffic as well. Recently, 115,000 people have come through the tourist mecca daily, a rise of 15% over the daily traffic since September. </p><p>   The numbers pale in comparison with the pre-Covid era. Hotel occupancy was 87.1% for a comparable week in March 2019, according to STR. And before the pandemic, 365,000 people visited Times Square daily. But Tom Harris, acting president and chief operating officer of the Times Square Alliance, is buoyed by what he sees and, in turn, what it holds for the future. </p><p>   \"I think the best is yet to come,\" he said. </p><p>   Tourism has become an increasingly important driver of the New York economy. The city welcomed a record 66.6 million visitors in 2019, according to NYC &amp; Company, the city's official tourism organization. In 2020, that figure fell to 22.3 million, but NYC &amp; Company has projected it will increase to 36.4 million in 2021, which suggests the current uptick is no fluke. </p><p>   Several factors are playing into what has happened in recent days, say tourism officials and those who work in the hospitality industry. Key among them is the increasing pace of the country's vaccination program, which is giving Americans confidence about traveling. Foreign tourism remains a weak spot, however, and isn't expected to pick up significantly until after 2021. </p><p>   Setting the stage for a continued rise in tourism is New York state's decision to end the requirement, as of April 1, that domestic travelers quarantine upon arrival. </p><p>   Several hotels in the city that closed during the pandemic have announced plans to reopen soon. New lodgings also are coming on board. Hyatt Hotels Corp. has plans to open three new hotels in the city between summer and early 2022. </p><p>   For New York City's tourism to fully rebound, many in the hospitality industry say it will be contingent on Broadway theaters reopening because the shows are a magnet for out-of-towners. New York state hasn't yet given the theaters the go-ahead to open at 100% capacity, and Broadway producers say they can't operate financially at anything less than that. Still, they are anticipating they will be allowed to do so by the fall or winter. </p><p>   Meanwhile, there is hope in the tourism industry that New York City offers enough to attract visitors, especially since museums are open and restaurants can offer indoor dining. </p><p>   Patrick McNamee, an owner of the Mean Fiddler, a Times Square pub, opened this week for the first time in months. He said business was slow last fall, prompting him to close, but \"you can definitely see\" the situation is changing, he said. </p><p></p>",
