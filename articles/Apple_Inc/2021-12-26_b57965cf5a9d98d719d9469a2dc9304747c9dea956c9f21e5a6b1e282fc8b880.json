  "text": "<p>The United Arab Emirates government has told some of its biggest business families that it intends to remove their monopolies on the sale of imported goods as the Gulf state deepens economic reforms in an effort to attract more investment. </p> <p>For decades, multinationals have had to appoint local partners to distribute their goods. The government has proposed legislation ending the automatic renewal of existing commercial agency agreements, giving foreign firms the flexibility to distribute their own goods or change their local agent on contract expiry.</p> <p>“It no longer makes sense for individual families to have such power and preferential access to easy wealth,” said an Emirati official. “We have to modernise our economy.” Officials have indicated that the new law is expected to be approved by Emirati leadership but the timing remains uncertain. The UAE government did not provide comment.</p> <p>The proposed reform would tear up the longstanding social contract between the government and influential merchant families, including storied names such as Al Futtaim, Al Rostamani and Juma Al Majid, replacing decades of protection for local interests in favour of foreign entities. “This is one of the taboos most difficult to touch due to its impact on family-owned local businesses, one of the largest sectors of the UAE economy,” said Habib Al Mulla, executive chair of law firm Baker McKenzie's Middle Eastern branch. </p> <p>Family-owned businesses, from small companies to the conglomerates built over the decades by leading merchant groups, make up 90 per cent of the UAE's private sector, which itself accounts for around three-quarters of employment. </p> <p>The changes are part of the UAE's drive to attract more investment via competitive legal and social changes, such as long-term residency programmes and fewer restrictions on cohabitation and alcohol.</p> <p>The pace of reform has accelerated in the wake of a nascent economic rivalry with neighbouring Saudi Arabia. The kingdom, as part of its own plans to diversify away from hydrocarbons, has imposed tariffs on Gulf imports and is pressuring multinationals to relocate regional headquarters to Riyadh.</p> <p>Alarmed at the speed of the proposed changes, leading merchant families have lobbied the deputy ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, people briefed on the matter said. </p> <p>The merchant families of Dubai dominate a retail sector that underpins the city-state's thriving tourism sector, which is rebounding again as the country's successful handling of the pandemic attracts visitors and new residents. At the expiry of commercial agency agreements, the local agents are expected to receive compensation for their investment in retail infrastructure and sales networks.</p> <p>“The consumer will benefit if the model moves from one exclusive agent to more than one distributor. However, the local agents have made large investments into these agencies and it would be fair to at least give them a few years to find a better model with foreign principals or to get a return on their investments,” said Al Mulla.</p> <p>In recent years, some new entrants, including Apple and Tesla, have been allowed to open their own stores without local agents. Other multinationals have been requesting that their local partners change agency agreements into joint ventures, giving them more control over marketing and raising their potential returns. Merchant families, recognising the inevitable end of archaic agency agreements, have been agreeing to such demands, the people added.</p> <p>“This is the right thing to do now, but perhaps not the right way of introducing it,” said one family business owner. “We have to move with the times, but the changes also need more consultation.”</p> <p>Representatives of family groups say that multinationals, instead of taking over operations in the UAE market of 10m people may instead choose to appoint their agents in other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, such as more populous Saudi Arabia. “The government thinks that, all of a sudden, international brands will flood the country, but actually GCC agencies will dominate,” said one businessman.</p> <p>The government nonetheless believes that opening the domestic market will lower prices for consumers. </p> <p>Family businesses also complain that rushed changes come at a time when the government is leaning on the private sector to employ more nationals. </p> <p>Over the next five years, the UAE has said that Emiratis should make up 10 per cent of employees in private companies, which have typically relied on cheap, imported labour. “The government needs to think about its relationship with the private sector, especially as it is now seeking to impose more demands on us,” said one executive at a family group.</p><p>Source: Simeon Kerr in Dubai 2021 'UAE pushes merchant families to open up to competition' FT.com 26 December.
