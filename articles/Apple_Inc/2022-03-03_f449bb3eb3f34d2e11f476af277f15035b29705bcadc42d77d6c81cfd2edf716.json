  "title": "Intel faces ‘all-or-nothing' situation, analyst says in downgrade",
  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore downgraded Intel's stock INTC to underperform from equal weight Thursday, as part of what he said was a move to “rebalance” ratings and “shift away from inexpensive cyclical stocks, at the margin.”</p><p>See also: Biden touts importance of U.S. chip manufacturing</p><p>“Downgrades of value stocks such as Intel and Qorvo QRVO will let us focus on more actionable situations that offer relatively more attractive risk-reward going forward,” he continued.</p><p>Intel shares were off 2.4% in Thursday morning trading. Meanwhile, the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX shed 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 232 points, or 0.7%.</p><p>While Moore likes Intel's new chief executive Pat Gelsinger and sees promise in the company's longer-term opportunity to turn around its core business, he expects that Intel's stock “will move sideways” over the next few years.</p><p>“While we would like to see Intel as a value stock, with optionality from a turnaround in the core business, the reality is that ramp of fixed costs creates a more ‘all-or-nothing' situation where the company is going to need to succeed in these new businesses—and still turn around their core business—or be looking at long-term gross margin and cash-flow degradation,” he wrote.</p><p>Moore cut his price target on Intel shares to $47 from $55.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Intel's Gelsinger lays out turnaround plan, and investors are in for a long haul</p><p>He also downgraded shares of Qorvo Inc. and Teradyne Inc. TER to equal weight from overweight.</p><p>On Qorvo, he sees a “significant chance of an inventory correction” around the second and third quarters, which makes the Morgan Stanley team “tactically a bit more cautious.”</p><p>As for Teradyne, Moore sees room for a “significant recovery” in the company's Apple Inc. AAPL business during 2023, but he's “less optimistic about the non-Apple parts of the business next year.”</p><p>Qorvo's stock is off 3.7% Thursday, while Teradyne's stock is down 3.9%.</p><p>More positively, he upgraded shares of GlobalFoundries Inc. GFS to overweight from equal weight, while boosting his price target to $72.50 from $70. GlobalFoundries shares are ahead 4.5% in Thursday's session.</p>",
