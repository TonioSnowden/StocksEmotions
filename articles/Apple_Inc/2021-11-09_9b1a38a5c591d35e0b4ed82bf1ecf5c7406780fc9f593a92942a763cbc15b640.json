  "title": "Judge denies Apple's motion to delay App Store changes in Epic antitrust case",
  "text": "<p>Gonzalez Rogers made her original ruling in the Apple-Epic Games Inc. antitrust lawsuit in September.</p><p>In a hearing Tuesday, Apple AAPL said it needed more time to rewrite its anti-steering policies that bar app developers from linking to payment methods besides the iOS App Store.</p><p>“Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email to MarketWatch.</p><p>Apple contends it will be irreparably harmed if it is forced to allow developers to steer their customers to cheaper payment systems starting in December, as the judge ordered.</p>",
