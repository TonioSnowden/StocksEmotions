  "title": "Meta shares slide more than 20% on earnings miss, weak guidance",
  "text": "<p>Meta also missed in its first-quarter revenue forecast, which calls for sales of $27 billion to $29 billion, while analysts were forecasting $30.2 billion. “On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people's time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>With Meta's shares in freefall, other social-media stocks were badly bruised. Snap Inc.'s SNAP shares were down 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while Twitter Inc. TWTR and Pinterest Inc. PINS were each down more than 10%.</p><p>Meta FB makes almost all of its revenue from advertising ($32.6 billion), but the growing importance of non-advertising revenue was exhibited with another announcement in the earnings. Revenue for Facebook Reality Labs was $877 million during the fourth quarter, but the segment also lost $3.3 billion in the quarter.&#xa0;</p><p>“I'm encouraged by the progress we made this past year in a number of important growth areas like Reels, commerce and virtual reality, and we'll continue investing in these and other key priorities in 2022 as we work toward building the metaverse,” Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a news release on the results. It was Meta's first results since the former Facebook changed its name in late October to reflect its pursuit of “metaverse” technology.</p><p>“We expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors… First, we will lap a period in which Apple's iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes,” Meta said.</p><p>For more than a year, Meta has repeatedly denounced the impact of Apple Inc.'s AAPL privacy change that makes it harder to track ads. Meta also faces increasing competition from the likes of TikTok and an ongoing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>“It's clear that there are many big roadblocks ahead as Meta faces tough new competition for ad revenue such as TikTok, and as it contends with ongoing ad targeting and measurement challenges from Apple's iOS changes,” Insider Intelligence principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said in an email message.</p><p>The results, on the heel of blockbuster numbers from Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGLGOOG on Tuesday, initially sent Meta's stock down 22% in after-hours trading after the results were announced and raised alarms on various aspects of Meta's business. One such concern is that many companies turned to Google instead of Facebook to place ads.</p><p>Daily active users, or DAUs, a crucial metric for Meta's growth globally, increased 5% to 1.93 billion, shy of analyst expectations of 1.95 billion. However, the actual number of DAUs has been met with skepticism after internal documents strongly suggest Meta is struggling to&#xa0;detect and deal with users creating multiple accounts on its flagship platform.</p><p>Meta shares have slipped 4% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX has dipped 3.7% in 2022.</p>",
