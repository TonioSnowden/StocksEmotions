  "title": "Google Countersues Match for Breach of Contract Over App Store Payments; Search giant wants to ban dating-app company from its app store amid a dispute over payments",
  "text": "<p>Match had sued Google in May, alleging the search giant unfairly required the company's dating apps to exclusively use Google's billing system to be part of its app store.</p><p>In its suit, Google said Match intentionally breached the developer distribution agreement it signed by using its own external payment systems in its apps rather than Google's billing system. Match also breached the agreement by failing to pay Google service fees for in-app purchases, the countersuit said.</p><p>By seeking to avoid making payments to Google, Match is attempting to place itself in an advantaged position relative to other app developers who honor their agreements, the lawsuit said.</p><p>\"Match Group never intended to comply with the contractual terms to which it agreed, and deceived Google by misrepresenting its true intentions,\" Google said in its countersuit. \"Instead, Match Group provokes this legal and public relations confrontation in an attempt to deprive Google of the benefit of its bargain with Match Group and to gain unfair advantage over other app developers.\"</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, Match said Google's policies for its app store, called Google Play, are anticompetitive and in violation of federal and state law.</p><p>\"This countersuit is a prime example of a monopoly using its power to frighten other developers into submission,\" Match said. \"Google doesn't want anyone else to sue them so their counterclaims are designed as a warning shot.\"</p><p>A Google spokesman dismissed Match's claims as baseless.</p><p>\"Match Group entered into a contract with us and this suit seeks to hold Match to its end of the agreement,\" the Google spokesman said. \"We're looking forward to making our case.\"</p><p>Match has said Google had previously assured it that Match's dating apps could use their own payment system for in-app purchases on Android devices.</p><p>In its countersuit, Google said Match incorrectly stated that the payments policy didn't apply to its apps. After being told it had to comply with the app store's payment policy, Match intentionally misled Google by falsely claiming it would adhere to the contractual agreement, Google said.</p><p>Google and Apple Inc. have been sued and faced regulatory probes in multiple countries related to their billing-system policies, which give the tech companies up to 30% of in-app purchases.</p><p>Spotify Technology SA reached an agreement in March with Google for an alternative payment method for in-app purchases. Google said Spotify was among a small number of developers participating in a pilot program allowing alternative purchase options.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Google Countersues Match for Breach of Contract Over App Store Payments</p>",
