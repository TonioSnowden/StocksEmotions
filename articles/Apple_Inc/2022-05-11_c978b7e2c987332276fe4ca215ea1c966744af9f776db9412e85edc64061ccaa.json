  "text": "<p>Saudi Aramco has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company after higher oil prices pushed shares of the world's biggest crude exporter to record levels while a broader tech stock sell-off weighed on the iPhone maker.</p> <p>The Saudi Arabian oil company's market capitalisation on Wednesday was $2.426tn, exceeding Apple's $2.415tn by just over $10bn.</p> <p>It is the first time that Saudi Aramco has regained the top spot since 2020 and follows a broader sell-off in technology stocks since the start of the year.</p> <p>Apple became the first company to hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57f57303-82b9-49db-89ee-54888e1c714d\">$3tn market cap</a> in early January, although its shares have suffered in recent months as investors reassess lofty valuations in the tech sector in light of a reversal in monetary policy and worries that inflation will weaken consumers' spending habits. </p> <p>The iPhone maker has held up better than some tech companies, having fallen 19 per cent since its January high. Apple shares fell 5.2 per cent to $146.50 on Wednesday in New York, putting the share price at its lowest since November.</p> <p>While Apple recently recorded its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e3a4e49-151d-4e83-b7ca-c532addba11e\">third-best quarter for revenues</a> ever, chief executive Tim Cook said supply shortages and lockdowns in China were expected to cost the company as much as $8bn this quarter.</p> <p>Some analysts questioned the merit of comparing the companies, given that Apple is a public company founded in a garage in California in 1976, while Saudi Aramco is a state-backed giant with only a small amount of freely floated shares. </p> <p>Saudi Aramco raised a record $25.6bn in 2019 when the kingdom — which owns 94 per cent of the company — listed 1.5 per cent of its shares in what was then the world's largest-ever initial public offering. In February, the government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3118568-8a02-409d-baaf-ee98553364cf\">transferred</a> an additional 4 per cent of its shares to Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.</p> <p>Saudi Aramco's shares, which are listed in Riyadh, have risen 28 per cent since the start of the year to trade at a record SR46 ($12.27).</p> <p>Oil prices, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4130028c-c5fb-4643-bdc7-c6da3b3bc0c9\">surged</a> to a 14-year high of $139 a barrel in March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have helped some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies deliver record profits in the first three months of the year.</p> <p>Saudi Aramco is also expected to announce bumper profits when it reports first-quarter earnings on Sunday. The company's net income more than doubled in 2021 to $110bn as resurgent economic activity following the easing of global coronavirus restrictions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df47949a-380a-43ca-9286-dfa89ed9016e\">revived demand</a> for hydrocarbons.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Peter Wells in New York</em></p><p>Source: Tom Wilson and Patrick McGee in London 2022 'Saudi Aramco overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company' FT.com 11 May.
