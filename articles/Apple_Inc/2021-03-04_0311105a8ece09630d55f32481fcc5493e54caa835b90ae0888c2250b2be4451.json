  "text": "<h2>‘A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in the Age of Overload', by Cal Newport</h2> <p>Could we ever live in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/572682e4-d701-4f33-af92-db597a7d39de\">a world without email?</a> US professor Cal Newport thinks we not only could but should.&#xa0;</p> <p>His reasons will sound grimly familiar to any office worker.&#xa0;There is too much email. It is too distracting. And the Sisyphean battle fought to deal with it makes us unproductive and miserable.</p> <p>Studies show some white-collar workers now spend more than three hours a day sending and receiving work emails, Newport writes, and check their inboxes once every six minutes. They do this knowing few emails require an instant response. Yet our ancient brains have evolved to feel concern about neglected social obligations, so a bulging inbox of unanswered mail makes us queasy.</p> <p>Newport's most important insight is that this is a systemic problem. Email has helped to drive a new way of working that he calls the hyperactive hive mind: a constant conversation among workers that distracts them from important tasks.&#xa0;</p> <p>So small tweaks in behaviour, such as email-free Fridays, will not help. Far more sweeping changes are needed so people can meet, schedule and collaborate without having to hit a send button.&#xa0;</p> <p>This won't be easy but as Newport writes, the productivity gains to be had are immense, and who would not like to start each day with an empty inbox?</p> <h2>‘How to Communicate Effectively with Anyone, Anywhere', by Raul Sanchez and Dan Bullock</h2> <p>This is an unusual and potentially very valuable addition to the often generic presentation and networking books that clog up our bookshelves. Sanchez and Bullock want readers to “shift our focus from presenting to our audience to connecting with our audience”. </p> <p>Rather than suggesting different presentation styles for different geographical and cultural audiences — beyond the general recommendation to keep to global English and avoid idioms when speaking to an international cohort — the authors have a loftier purpose in mind. </p> <p>They outline the six types of story, foremost among them the hero's journey that is familiar in all cultures. “Our presentations function in the same way — as a quest — and once we acknowledge that the audience is the hero, not us, we begin to embrace our true role as the guide.” Yes, it is a bit spiritual, but the authors are experienced communications trainers — Bullock works at the United Nations Secretariat, and Sanchez is an assistant professor at New York University's School of Professional Studies.</p> <p>Various chapters deal with presenting in person and virtually, body language, negotiation in a global setting and strategic writing. There are also tips on reframing networking, which are likely to be very useful as we gradually move back to in-person meetings. By making an effort to meet people from different cultures, industries and generations, we are learning more and building trust for the future. It's an unusual and fresh take — and the text is broken up with lots of illustrations and charts by Sanchez himself. </p> <h2>‘The CEO Test: Master the Challenges that Make or Break All Leaders', by Adam Bryant and Kevin Sharer</h2> <p>There is a lot of leadership experience packed into this slim primer. Adam Bryant, now a consultant, draws on interviews with some 600 leaders, including those he conducted for the “Corner Office” feature he conceived when a journalist at the New York Times. Kevin Sharer provides the reality check for those insights, based on his time as chief executive of Amgen, the biotechnology group, and, earlier in his career, as a submarine engineer and officer in the US navy.</p> <p>The result is an engaging and well-written guide to running a team effectively. They divide the “test” into seven short challenges that can “make or break” a leader, from strategy-setting, via culture-shaping, to crisis management, all rooted in real examples. The crisis chapter, for instance, draws on leaders' experience of the pandemic as well as how they coped (or failed to cope) with internal disaster. Leaders do not have to ace all the parts of the test, but good ones will demonstrate a certain proficiency in each. Leading through a crisis is “a kind of final exam”.</p> <p>The authors practise what they preach, simplifying complexity (a leadership “superpower”), steering clear of cookie-cutter truisms, and preferring readable common sense to ideological waffle or textbook dryness. Bryant and Sharer point out in their introduction that “very little that is written about leadership is wrong”, but they add that “just because something isn't wrong doesn't mean it's an insight”. Still, this book contains enough concentrated insights to earn its place on the overcrowded leadership shelves.</p> <h2>‘Beating Burnout at Work: Why Teams Hold the Secret to Well-Being and Resilience', by Paula Davis</h2> <p>A successful lawyer until she was felled by burnout, the author of this short manual about how teams can work together to combat stress, now teaches resilience to US soldiers, among others.</p> <p><em>Beating Burnout at Work</em> is a concentrated course. Its insights bathe in an alphabet soup of abbreviations, from TNTs (“tiny noticeable things” that can change a team's approach) to ABCs (“autonomy, belonging, and competence”, the “essential nutrients” of workplace wellbeing), but they are worth absorbing nonetheless.</p> <p>The core ideas for changing the behaviour of leaders, individuals, and teams, are valuable and practical, tested on hospital staff, military personnel and corporate teams. The book includes questions and tables to help assess potential for burnout and how to prevent it. Team success, Davis argues persuasively, is based on the components of the inevitable acronym “PRIMED”: psychological safety; relationships; impact (of the team's work); mental strength; energy; and the right design of job tasks and roles. </p> <p>Davis writes: “Given the increased complexity of work and the rapid pace of change in many work environments (now amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic), professionals need to team up to effectively solve problems.” These are timely lessons, in mercifully compact form, and for those who wish to dig deeper, they are backed by extensive notes leading to the academic literature.</p> <h2>‘Elites: Can you rise to the top without losing your soul?', by Douglas Board</h2> <p><em>Elites</em> looks as though it is another book about how to rise to the top in business. It turns out to be more interesting, and more profound. This is as much a work of social philosophy as it is a business book — an examination of meritocracy, meaning and the “magic tricks” by which a small group sustains itself at the pinnacle of society.</p> <p>Board's credentials include a long stint as a headhunter — gatekeeper to the elite “wizard” level of UK business — and a shorter period as chair of a charity, an elite of sorts. Channelling the social distinctions of the Harry Potter novels, he places himself squarely as champion of “the muggle crust” who form the upper level of those aspiring to make it to the top. These are the real heroes of business, who do the hard work of running stuff.</p> <p><em>Elites</em>' exposure of the contortions that muggles undergo to ingratiate themselves with wizards is sharp and often very funny. Board's tips could even be useful for anyone wanting to cross the chasm to wizardhood. His serious and subversive point, however, is that the quest simply may not be worth it. Instead, everyone has the opportunity to form fruitful ties with like-minded people and contribute to a much more diverse society.</p> <p>“Human existence is connection,” Board writes. “Thanks to not understanding this we give too much respect to elites and not enough to everyone else, including ourselves.”</p> <h2>‘Just Work: Get Sh*t Done Fast and Fair', by Kim Scott</h2> <p>In her first job after college, Kim Scott was paid less than her male peers and experienced gaslighting and serious sexual harassment. Her treatment was unjust. But despite this she felt there was little she could do given such behaviour was coming from her higher-ups.&#xa0;</p> <p>While Scott was a victim of work injustice, in coming up with this book's theory on how to build just working environments she highlights that in other ways she has been a perpetrator and recognises that she has benefited from her own privileges. These “made my life easier, usually in ways I didn't like to think about. I was always white, and there was always racial injustice, everywhere. I was never poor, and there is always economic injustice, everywhere.”</p> <p>Scott, who is also a former Google and Apple executive, believes that to create a just workplace, we need to confront our discomforts — whether that is certain privileges we have, or a failure to check bias, or discriminatory or bullying behaviour. </p> <p>Scott writes that workplace injustice stems from six different problems: bias, prejudice, bullying, discrimination, verbal harassment, and physical violations. In three parts — the root causes of workplace injustice; caution-power imbalance; and systemic justice and injustice — she sets out how to address them, whether you are the harmed, an upstander or a leader.</p> <p>Put simply, a more collaborative work environment with a respect for individuality is more productive. But it doesn't mean it is always easy to achieve.</p> <h2>‘The Lost Art of Connecting: The Gather, Ask, Do Method for Building Meaningful Business Relationships', by Susan McPherson</h2> <p>Making strategic and meaningful connections are fundamental, not only for our careers but for our lives. Susan McPherson's new book offers more than a guide about inspirational networking, it brings back the value and the power of human contact.</p> <p>The renowned “serial connector” presents a clear road map with exercises and examples to unlock lasting and fulfilling relationships, no matter your personality type. Her approach is insightful and broken down into three sections: Gather; Ask; Do.</p> <p>In the first section — Gather — we are introduced to techniques to create our own opportunities respecting the resources available: first examining our relationship with ourselves and clarifying our goals, then analysing suggestions for establishing initial connections. Examples include volunteering and the correct use of technology to make the gathering happen.</p> <p>The second part is all about asking questions and building the depth of our relationships. Curiosity is important and the question “how can I help?” can be used to open the doors to share resources, experiences, other contacts and perspectives. Asking more questions and the right ones will start to help plans fall into place.</p> <p>The final part is filled with recommendations to solidify our network and how to take action, build trust and “Do”. Rituals are essential for the ongoing process of staying in touch with people: virtual coffee on Tuesdays and a Peloton ride on Saturdays are some examples.</p> <p>Two valuable pieces of advice resonate from the book: do not lose authenticity and always help the other person to feel seen, safe and secure.</p> <h2>‘WFH (Working From Home): How To Build a Career You Love When You're Not in the Office', by Harriet Minter</h2> <p>As companies are making all possible adjustments to create more flexible working culture, Harriet Minter offers a one-stop resource for those working from home or those who want to work from home but are still sceptical.</p> <p>As well as a career guide, the book also presents useful tips and tools to adapt and refine our working life until we have created the one that works best for us — all based on the reality of working from home.</p> <p>Minter walks us through the cycle of working from home, from figuring out if it is what we really want, talking to line managers about it, working out the different stages of a career, managing a team and finally moving on.</p> <p>It is advisable to have a notebook when reading it: each chapter has questions and exercises to think about, plus a list of interesting skills that can be practised every day to make our work more effective and creative.</p> <p>The chapter dedicated to mental health offers ways to protect our confidence and happiness, and some creative exercises to minimise the curse of perfectionism, a lack of motivation and loneliness.</p> <p>Limits are important and should be exercised little and often when working from home but make sure you can break them whenever necessary, is one of the messages. While things have improved, Minter's book shows there is still much we can do to bring our best to work, from our home.</p> <h2>‘Monster — A Tough Love Letter On Taming The Machines That Rule Our Jobs, Lives, and Future', by Paul Roehrig and Ben Pring</h2> <p>Technology has become a beast we can no longer live without. It lurks in every room, in everyday devices, from washing machines to phones the monster is all around us, and we are growing increasingly wary of it.</p> <p>In their “deliberately short book” IT analysts, management consultants and technology practitioners Roehrig and Pring explore how big a beast technology has become, and how we can tame it to maintain our freedom and privacy while still realising its benefits.</p> <p>This book is timely, as the pandemic has shown just how much we rely on technology and how addictive it has become. Our jobs, lives and futures will rely on it. The issue technology poses is a complex one, the authors break this down by exploring the problem through four key pillars: Capital, Psychology, Society and The New Machine(s). These pillars form the key chapters of the book.</p> <p>The authors address the important questions, what we should be paying attention to, and what must be done to take control of technology. They give readers 13 easy lessons on how to tame the beast.</p> <p>The book is, as its title states, a tough love letter on taming the machines that rule our jobs, lives and future, while Roehrig and Pring do not hesitate to condemn the problems of technology, they stress that it is our revolution, fall behind at your peril. They urge us not to slay the monster but rather to leverage its power and reorient technology as a tool for good.</p> <h2>‘Alien Thinking: How to Bring Your Breakthrough Ideas to Life', by Cyril Bouquet, Jean-Louis Barsoux and Michael Wade</h2> <p><em>Alien Thinking</em> is the brainchild of three professors at IMD business school in Switzerland. The authors put it to readers that their old ways of approaching problems are holding them back from developing breakthrough ideas, that our outdated approaches are an enemy to innovation.</p> <p>The problem they say is that we need to adopt a radically different way of thinking, to see the world with fresh eyes, to develop a state of mind called “vuja de”.</p> <p>The book picks apart the underlying reasons behind innovation success stories such as Amazon's Kindle, which dominates the world of eBooks, leaving the likes of Sony trailing behind.</p> <p>The professors present a model to enable the reader to generate breakthrough solutions by applying the techniques of “alien” thinking to their everyday lives.</p> <p>This concept is built around five principles: Attention, Levitate, Imagination, Experimentation and Navigation are contextualised through remarkable real-life success stories.</p> <p>Attention: for example, requires us to look for problems that need to be sorted and to consider how to drastically improve or revise old solutions to these problems. To experiment is to put these ideas to the test. To turn a promising idea into a workable solution that addresses a real need.</p> <p>All in all, this book is a study of what drives successful creativity and innovation. It provides the reader with a toolbox of techniques to change the way you think about problems, to be the Amazon, not the Sony, of innovation.</p> <h2>‘The Social CEO: How Social Media Can Make You a Stronger Leader', by Damian Corbet</h2> <p>Mastering social media is a sure-fire way to build an enormous following in the 21st&#xa0;century. Just ask Donald Trump. But does it make you a better leader? <em>The Social CEO</em> is a book, or rather a combination of essays, written by a collection of founders, chief executives and consultants, who think it does. More than that, they believe that successful CEOs need to do more than just hire knowledgeable social media specialists and become social media experts themselves.</p> <p>This 280-page paperback is evangelistic on the value of social media, highlighting how it can help leaders of organisations better deal with PR, attract young talent and improve internal communication.</p> <p>One of the 27 chapters does focus on the risks of digital communication, and this does at least include a set of practical guidelines.</p> <p><em>The Social CEO</em> is a book to dip into rather than read cover to cover. It has a rich variety of perspectives, and it has been laid out so that readers should be able to find someone running an organisation like their own. The idea seems to be to inspire leaders to embrace the social age and hopefully pick up a few tips on how to do that better in their organisation.</p><p>Source: Pilita Clark, Isabel Berwick, Andrew Hill, Pip Murrison, Janina Conboye, Leo Cremonezi and Jonathan Moules 2021 'FT business books: March edition' FT.com 4 March.
