  "text": "<p>The second-biggest ride-sharing company in the US is having a bumpy journey. Lyft's shared taxis are not compatible with a pandemic. Rider numbers are down from 23m to 12.5m. Time for potential buyers to start sniffing around.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Co-founder and chief executive Logan Green insists bright days are ahead. He told investors on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Lyft anticipated a “strong rebound in demand”. This, along with Lyft's exemption from California's new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40d579fe-37ac-4791-82b1-13b609bb5661\">gig worker</a> employment rules, is why the share price is up more than 140 per cent since October.&#xa0;</p> <p>Optimism is a prerequisite for executives and investors in ride-hailing. How else to keep banging the drum for an industry that remains<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9b2c123-4464-4cc1-9505-b195b235dc5e\"> lossmaking</a> after about a decade of operation? Look at the numbers, however, and gloom is hard to dispel.</p> <p>Lyft made a full-year net loss of $1.8bn on $2.4bn of sales. The only reason there is less red ink than the previous year is because Lyft put a screeching halt on spending. Costs were cut by $360m. The group has largely removed the driver and rider incentives necessary to remain competitive with Uber. These will return. Once the top line grows, so will losses.</p> <p>The draw for bidders would be Lyft's potential role in driverless cars. The $17bn company is not building vehicles, but an entire self-driving system. At the end of last year it said customers could be using its app to hail driverless cars by 2023.&#xa0;</p> <p>Stop Lex if you've heard this one before. Tesla promised a million robotaxis on the road by 2019. General Motors said it would have self-driving taxis by 2020. </p> <p>Regardless, investment on this is picking up. Amazon has bought self-driving start-up Zoox. Apple has hired Tesla's former chief executive of self-driving operations. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81793b42-28be-424d-a51c-006677fb2809\">Microsoft</a> recently joined a $2bn investment in GM's autonomous driving company Cruise. </p> <p>If the ventures succeed, Lyft's consumer-facing app could be just the thing to turn driverless cars into a viable commercial proposition. Lyft might then be worth more to a bidder than to the public market.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
