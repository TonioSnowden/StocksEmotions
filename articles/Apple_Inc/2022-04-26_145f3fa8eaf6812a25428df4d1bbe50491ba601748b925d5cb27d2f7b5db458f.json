  "text": "<p>Only the wrecks of Russian tanks and army rations serve as a reminder of their presence here. But gone with the Russians were six local men, who are among the growing number of people who have gone missing from villages and towns across Ukraine.</p><p>\"The Russians have taken my brother away, and we have no idea where he is, what happened to him, is he alive, is he dead. Nothing,\" said Natalia Honcharuk, who works in a village grocery store. \"Mama keeps calling authorities every day and nobody can tell us anything.\"</p><p>During their ten-day occupation of Velykyi Bobryk, which had a prewar population of roughly 1,000 people, Russian forces didn't engage in the kind of killings that marked their stay in towns like Bucha, near Kyiv.</p><p>But during the occupation, the Ukrainian resistance encouraged locals to pass on images and GPS coordinates of Russian positions and convoys. The information was then used to organize ambushes or coordinate strikes by long-range artillery or Turkish-supplied Bayraktar TB2 drones.</p><p>\"Every old lady in every village would send us photos of Russian convoys. Everyone was helping us,\" said Ihor, a Ukrainian intelligence service official in the regional capital of Sumy who isn't allowed to disclose his surname.</p><p>In Velykyi Bobryk, residents created a neighborhood messaging group using the Viber app, sharing news about Russian movements in the area and sometimes photos of Russian convoys. When Russian troops began searching the village, the first thing they demanded to see was the residents' smartphones. The Viber group was quickly disbanded, but some of the images had auto-downloaded onto residents' phones.</p><p>Ms. Honcharuk, who lived with her mother and her brother, Serhiy, 45, said she gladly showed the Russians her smartphone, which didn't have anything illicit. She said her brother, who was sickly after two severe bouts of Covid-19, owned just an old phone without a camera or internet access. The Russians didn't believe him. \"Why are you lying!\" they shouted as they dragged Serhiy out of the house, put him atop an armored personnel carrier—a common tactic of using civilians to thwart attacks—and drove him to their camp.</p><p>Ms. Honcharuk said she tried to look for her brother two days later at a Russian checkpoint, but by then a different group of Russian troops was there. They told her that her brother was in Boromlya, the nearest town where Russian troops had set up an interrogation facility in a local egg-packaging factory.</p><p>\"They said, he will be investigated by competent organs and then sent back home, don't worry,\" Ms. Honcharuk said. \"Now I understand they were telling everyone the same thing.\"</p><p>On the other side of the village, the first Russian search went well, thought Vita Yurinova. The 36-year-old who likes to get around on a bicycle, lives in one of Velykyi Bobryk's nicer homes with her mother-in-law and two daughters. Her husband, Viktor, 48, worked as a truck driver.</p><p>\"Will you shoot us?\" Ms. Yurinova said she asked when Russian troops first appeared at their gate. \"No, we won't,\" the Russians replied. They searched the closets, the kitchen, the shed, the cellar and, after finding nothing incriminating, proceeded to the next house, she said.</p><p>The next morning, Ms. Yurinova said she saw a black Russian drone hovering over her courtyard. At about 11:30 a.m., a Russian armored personnel carrier roared up to their gate. Several soldiers with guns at the ready pushed in and one of them showed a phone, confiscated from another villager, with photographs of Mr. Demidov and two other men.</p><p>\"Demidov, we already killed him,\" the soldier said. \"Who are the other two with him? Why did they have to kill two of our tank crew?\" When Mr. Yurinov said he didn't know the two men, the soldier cursed and hit him, Ms. Yurinova says.</p><p>As the Russians led away Ms. Yurinova's husband, they started interrogating her in the courtyard. One of them cracked a joke about their age discrepancy. \"What use can you have for an old man like that?\" he asked.</p><p>Less than an hour later, the Russians returned to detain Ms. Yurinova. In their headquarters, the basement of a grocery and coffee shop near the church on the main square, an interrogator scrutinized her phone. He found a photo of a friend wearing a military uniform and the number for a Territorial Defense member. He also found a photo of a Russian convoy that was auto-downloaded from the neighborhood messaging group.</p><p>\"Shall we have our way with her?\" one of the soldiers said, Ms. Yurinova recalled. \"No way, look at her, she looks too old and haggard,\" said another. Instead, he suggested bringing Ms. Yurinova's 16-year-old daughter to the base. She said she pleaded with the guards to leave her daughter alone.</p><p>The Russians then brought Ms. Yurinova out of the basement. Her husband was outside on his knees, his mouth sealed with duct tape, his hands tied, his nose bloodied and broken. Three other villagers were in the same group, with one of them trying to persuade the troops that he had not meant any ill intent in taking a snapshot of the convoy. A Russian soldier kicked Mr. Yurinov, another fired a bullet into the ground, she said.</p><p>She was then separated from the others, waiting in the dark of the basement until she was released around 2.30 pm that afternoon. \"Go home and educate your children, not in the Nazi propaganda you have been fed, but to be normal people,\" a soldier told her.</p><p>By then, Ms. Yurinova's husband and the other prisoners were gone.</p><p>Russian troops also came to Nadia Velichenko's home. \"Are there any Nazis in the house?\" she recalled them asking. They took her son, Yuli, away the next day after learning he had previously fought with Ukraine's military against pro-Russian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.</p><p>\"Mother, if his hands are not stained by blood, we will let him go,\" she recalled the Russians telling her as they drove off with her son.</p><p>Hungry Russian soldiers begun breaking into empty local homes and into shops taking everything they could. At the store where Ms. Honcharuk worked, owner Yevhen Demchenko said losses and damages topped $10,000.</p><p>Ms. Yurinova continued asking Russian troops about her husband. On March 24, she was told to inquire with a Russian officer who went by the name Travel and operated out of Velykyi Bobryk's school.</p><p>\"Don't worry, he is in Belgorod,\" the Russian city about three hours drive away, Travel told her after making inquiries, she said. \"If he is innocent, he will be freed, and if he's not he will be traded in a prisoner exchange.\"</p><p>\"How can I not worry?\" Ms. Yurinova retorted, saying that her husband suffers from thyroid and liver disease.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russian forces had stepped up their sweep of their area.</p><p>At their interrogation site at the packaging factory in Boromlya, Russian troops used sophisticated equipment to examine detainees' phones and ran their names through intelligence databases, according to the town's mayor.</p><p>In the nearby village of Hrebenykivka, a resident whom The Wall Street Journal agreed to identify by his first name Serhiy, was picked up on March 14 along with four other men and taken for interrogation across the border in Belgorod about possible connections with the Ukrainian resistance. While three men still remain in Russian captivity, Serhiy says he and another villager were cleared and sent back to Ukraine on March 21, where they were taken to the interrogation site in Boromlya while waiting to be taken back to Hrebenykivka.</p><p>There he shared the basement with Mr. Yurinov and four other detainees from Velykyi Bobryk before they, too, were taken to Belgorod, he said. They were in bad shape, Serhiy said.</p><p>\"One had a gunshot in the foot, one had a torn and broken nose after they dragged him with a hook, another had torn ears. They had been beaten into pulp,\" he recalled.</p><p>The Russian soldiers, by then, were fearful of constant ambushes and were taking it out on their prisoners. Ukrainian forces recaptured Trostyanets, the next town down the road from Boromlya, on March 25. Much of the central square there is still full of burned-out Russian armor and trash left by the retreating Russian soldiers, who spray-painted slurs about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on several buildings.</p><p>The following day, the Russians left Velykyi Bobryk as part of a wider withdrawal from northern Ukraine.</p><p>Residents wrote \"Glory to Ukraine\" once again on the side of a central shop by the church where the Russians had painted over the previous version of the slogan. Someone had put a sign on the road saying \"Marauders' street\" where the Russians used to have their headquarters.</p><p>\"Occupation was such a terrible thing, it's as if they strangle you and cut off the oxygen,\" said Natalia Varyonova, 47, as she was restocking the empty central shop with freshly arrived supplies. \"Thank God we have survived this, we are a strong nation. I hope they never come back here.\"</p><p>Ms. Velichenko, tearing up, said she had been told that her son had been taken to Russia and his name had been put on a list of prisoners eligible for exchange. It was unknown when he might be traded.</p><p>Ms. Yurinova says she was heartened by a recent call from Serhiy, the man who was imprisoned with her husband in Boromlya.</p><p>\"At least we know that my husband is alive,\" she said. \"Now we just sit by the phone, waiting for someone to call.\" As she showed a faded photo of her husband, her 16-year-old daughter, Katya, thrust forward her iPhone. \"Please have a look at this one instead, my daddy doesn't look like that old photograph anymore,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Honcharuk said she still has no news of her brother.</p><p>Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com</p><p>In Ukrainian Villages, Fears Grow for Men Taken to Russia</p>",
