  "text": "<p>* Lucid Group shares jumped 7.6% premarket, after having closed Thursday's regular session up 31%. The electric-vehicle maker earlier this week said that deliveries of its first \"dream edition\" Lucid Air electric luxury sedans will begin on Saturday.</p><p>* MicroVision shares plunged 18% ahead of the bell. The laser beam scanning technology developer reported a quarterly loss after Thursday's close.</p><p>* Chevron added 1.7% after the energy company beat forecasts for both profit and revenue during the recent quarter.</p><p>* Results are due from Colgate-Palmolive, Exxon Mobil, AbbVie and Royal Caribbean before the open.</p><p>* Starbucks shares dipped 4.9% premarket. The coffee chain said its U.S. sales were strong during its most recent quarter, though the pandemic's resurgence in China dragged on its revenue.</p><p>* Zendesk plummeted 20% premarket. The customer-service platform is buying the parent company of SurveyMonkey, an online questionnaire platform, in a stock deal valued at $4.13 billion.</p><p>* Facebook is getting a makeoverâ€”to its name at least. The social-media behemoth changed its name to Meta to reflect its aspirations in the metaverse. Its ticker will become MVRS, but for now, the old one, FB, nudged up 0.6%.</p><p>* U.S.-traded shares of Atlassian jumped 8.3% premarket. The Australian software maker reported quarterly revenue of $614 million, up from $459.5 million in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Investors are betting the worst is over for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba after a punishing selloff halved its market value, but they may have to wait a while for the former market darling to regain its glory.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Lucid, Chevron: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
