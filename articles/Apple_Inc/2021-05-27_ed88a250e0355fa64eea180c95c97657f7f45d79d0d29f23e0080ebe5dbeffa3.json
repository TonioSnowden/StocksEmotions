  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Giving the people what they want is an old maxim in Hollywood. Amazon.com may be targeting the wrong people. </p><p>\n  Amazon's $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Holdings announced Wednesday is a milestone deal for a few reasons. It is the e-commerce company's second-largest ever following the $13.7 billion outlay for Whole Foods Market in 2017. It is also the biggest play to date among tech titans with Hollywood aspirations. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google spent large sums acquiring content for their streaming services, but none has yet taken over a studio and the library that goes with it. </p><p>\n  MGM ranks well below major studios such as Disney and Warner Bros. in terms of box-office share, but it is home to major properties such as the James Bond and \"Rocky\" movies. Yet this deal stands out as the boldest example yet of a tech giant tempting fate with lawmakers and regulators when many loudly expressed the belief that the company is too powerful. Amazon was hit Tuesday with an antitrust suit by the District of Columbia, accusing it of preventing sellers on its marketplace from offering better deals elsewhere. </p><p>\n  Others called for breakup measures, such as unwinding the Whole Foods acquisition. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who expressed misgivings about the deal at the time and is head of the Senate's antitrust subcommittee, proposed a bill that effectively shifts the burden of proof to large companies making acquisitions. Under that measure, such companies would need to prove their deals don't \"create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.\" </p><p>\n  MGM's relative size would make that seem not such a huge burden for Amazon to meet. According to The Numbers, which tracks box-office performance, MGM has averaged less than 2% of the box office between 1995 and 2021. And Amazon Prime Video is one of many streaming services competing for viewers' attention. New entrants such as HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount+ are all backed by large studios with deep libraries. </p><p>\n  But Prime is widely considered to be the second-largest streaming service in terms of viewership. A Morgan Stanley survey last month found 45% of U.S. respondents said they used Prime Video -- second only to Netflix with 58%. The attachment to Amazon's Prime shipping service gives it a serious advantage. Amazon disclosed last month that Prime subscribers surpassed the 200 million mark, which gives Prime Video one-click access to a global viewership roughly on par with Netflix. </p><p>\n  Buying MGM won't make Amazon dominant in streaming, but the deal will strengthen its hand in a key business right when many in power feel the company's hand is strong enough. CEO Jeff Bezos defended the deal in Amazon's annual meeting Wednesday, adding \"we welcome the scrutiny.\" Good thing, as putting Rocky into the Everything Store is a good way to call out those already itching for a fight. </p><p></p>",
