  "text": "<p>After one of the worst initial public offerings of the year, AppLovin bounced back with a staunch set of quarterly results. Revenues more than doubled on the previous year to $669m. Net income turned positive at $14m. The resilience of the Silicon Valley company to Apple data tweaks is encouraging. Its voting structure is not.&#xa0;</p> <p>AppLovin has a name that makes it sound like a nerdy character from the movie Superbad and two main businesses. Each contributes about half of total revenue. The first provides marketing and analytics software for app developers, particularly mobile game creators. The second creates mobile games itself.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gaming is more popular than ever. In June, the market took $7.3bn in consumer spending across Apple and Google app stores. This is up a tenth on the previous year, according to Sensor Tower. Yet when the Palo Alto group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42f8503c-02e5-4403-be04-551ba614057c\">listed shares</a> in April they closed down 18.5 per cent. They still trade 27 per cent below the IPO price.&#xa0;</p> <p>This reflects nervousness at upheaval in the digital advertising on which mobile gaming largely depends. Apple has allowed users to opt out of data tracking, panicking the industry. The second-quarter results proved this has not stopped AppLovin from monetising data it collects.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company's $21bn valuation is steep when you consider AppLovin planned to sell itself to China's Orient Hontai Capital in 2016 for just $1.4bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>That deal was nixed on personal data concerns. Has enough changed in five years for the company to be valued around 15 times more? No. Revenue growth is strong but profitability is patchy. AppLovin is heavily indebted too, after co-founder Adam Foroughi borrowed to expand the company. Debt is almost six times expected 2021 ebitda.&#xa0;</p> <p>The biggest problem is a lack of input from investors. Between them, Foroughi, chief financial officer Herald Chen and buyout group KKR hold more than 93 per cent of voting power.&#xa0;Tech companies are known for their egregious withholding of voting rights.&#xa0;Perhaps minorities have finally had enough. </p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'AppLovin: mobile software company shakes off Apple's privacy tweak but profitability is patchy' FT.com 12 August.
