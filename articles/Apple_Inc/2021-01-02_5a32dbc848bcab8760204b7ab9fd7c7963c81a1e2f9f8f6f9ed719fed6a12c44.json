  "text": "<p>The stock market bulls who drove Tesla's shares up eightfold in 2020 were handed a new year present on Saturday, as the electric carmaker reported record deliveries of new vehicles that comfortably beat Wall Street expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/314c23a1-6a93-450f-b62c-2f801aff2cff\">Tesla</a> said it had delivered 180,570 vehicles during the fourth quarter, ahead of the 174,000 analysts had expected. It also came within a hair's breadth of reaching the half-million target for 2020 that Elon Musk, chief executive officer, set earlier in the year, with deliveries hitting 499,550.</p> <p>The latest figures suggested Tesla was firing on all cylinders at the end of a year in which the global automobile industry suffered a sharp contraction in sales. Sales were boosted by the rapid ramping up of production at a plant in Shanghai that opened early in the year and the launch of the Model Y, a crossover based on the company's Model 3.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8251e5f-10a7-4f7a-9047-b438e4d7f83a\">Tesla</a> showed its Model 3 in 2016, leading to a rush of deposits from potential buyers, Mr Musk predicted sales would hit as many as 1m vehicles in 2020. Though reaching just half that, the actual figure — an increase of 36 per cent from the year before — still showed that Tesla was scaling up its global operations more quickly than some had expected.</p> <p>Mr Musk's targets for Tesla have often turned out to be wildly overambitious, such as his claim that 1m of its vehicles would be operating as fully autonomous “robo-taxis” by the end of 2020. But he has still defied the short-sellers on Wall Street who have repeatedly predicted disaster for the company — despite admitting to his own frequent misgivings.</p> <p>“At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all,” Mr Musk tweeted after the latest delivery numbers were released. Last month, he claimed that financial pressures in the early days of the Model 3 once led him to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2124105-8f0a-4e99-a1c8-d8bee28f9fe7\">seek a meeting</a> with Tim Cook, head of Apple, about a possible sale.</p> <p>Deliveries in the quarter also represented a new high, climbing 30 per cent from the previous peak hit during the third quarter. The company said on Saturday that it had started producing the Model Y in China, and that new plants in Texas and Germany are due to start production this year.</p> <p>Tesla's shares ended last year at a record high following its entry to the S&amp;P 500 index in December, which valued the company at $669bn.</p> <p>Even in the depths of Tesla's financial difficulties, Mr Musk publicly maintained his lofty predictions. At the time, he said that he thought Tesla could one day be worth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73089ac4-305c-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a\">more than Apple</a>, while admitting: “I could be delusional.”</p> <p>Tesla is currently worth around 85 per cent of Apple's $775bn value at the time — though the iPhone maker is now worth more than $2tr.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7abb1a40-50ce-40b3-9724-bb54f0dcbec1\"><em>One motoring idiom that doesn't work for Tesla</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7abb1a40-50ce-40b3-9724-bb54f0dcbec1\"><em>From Mike Pugh, London IG8, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Richard Waters in San Francisco 2021 'Tesla beats expectations with record vehicle deliveries' FT.com 2 January.
