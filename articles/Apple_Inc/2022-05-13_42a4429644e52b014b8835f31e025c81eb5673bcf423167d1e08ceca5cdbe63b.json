  "title": "Rate Fears Drive Dow Down Again --- Blue chips lose 104 points as money managers expect aggressive Fed moves",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have come under pressure due to concerns about the Fed's pullback of easy monetary policies as it combats high inflation. Consumer prices rose in April at a slower pace than the previous month but still faster than economists had expected, data released Wednesday showed.</p><p>That fueled more worries that the central bank will raise interest rates aggressively and crush economic growth, weighing on markets that had grown accustomed to loose monetary policy. Technology stocks flourished in the ultralow interest-rate era and have tumbled sharply this year, with the Nasdaq Composite trading at its lowest level since November 2020.</p><p>\"[Tech investors] found themselves at the most vulnerable time, the farthest out on the cliff, so now they're walking back from the cliff and trying to get on more solid ground, and they're changing their risk profiles,\" said Dan Genter, chief executive and chief investment officer of Genter Capital Management.</p><p>Mr. Genter recommends taking advantage of the recent declines, which have made equities more affordable. His firm isn't worried about a recession but is still holding dividend-paying stocks out of caution.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.815%, dropping for a fourth consecutive trading session. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The recent declines in Treasury yields signal that the relationship between bonds and stocks could be improving. Earlier in the year, stocks and bonds fell in tandem at a pace not seen in decades.</p><p>\"It's possible the correlation between bonds and equities from here on goes back to being negative, and that's one of the elements needed to stabilize the markets,\" said Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust.</p><p>The producer-price index rose by an annual rate of 11% in April. That marked a decline from the previous month but was still ahead of the predictions of economists. Weekly jobless claims came in at 203,000, nearly unchanged from the previous week.</p><p>\"Markets, on the margin, have shifted their probability toward a hard landing and toward further tightening from the Fed,\" said Karim Chedid, an investment strategist at BlackRock. The decline in longer-dated bond yields suggests that growth expectations have fallen, he said.</p><p>The dollar strengthened, with the WSJ Dollar Index rising 0.5%, its highest level since March 2020. The index measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies.</p><p>In corporate news, Beyond Meat fell $1.09, or 4.2%, to $25.08 after the meat-alternative company reported a wider-than-expected loss for the latest quarter due to higher spending.</p><p>WeWork rose 53 cents, or 10%, to $5.63 after reporting a narrower loss and raising its guidance. Walt Disney declined 90 cents, or 0.9%, to $104.31 after reporting higher operating losses and saying it may not maintain its current growth rate in streaming subscribers.</p><p>Meme stocks climbed. GameStop rose $8.24, or 10%, to $89.57. AMC Entertainment added 83 cents, or 8%, to $11.20. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond gained 18 cents, or 2%, to $9.40.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, surpassed Apple as the largest company in the world by market value, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Apple's stock fell $3.94, or 2.7%, to $142.56.</p><p>Oil prices fell after U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected, then recovered a bit. Global benchmark Brent crude fell 6 cents a barrel, or less than 0.1%, to $107.45. Prices were also weighed down by slow progress on European Union negotiations to potentially ban Russian crude imports, according to analysts at ANZ.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7%. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 2.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.7%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
