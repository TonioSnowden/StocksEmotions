  "title": "Hong Kong's young journalists decry the ‘death of free press'",
  "text": "<p>Five years is the average career span for many young journalists in Hong Kong, or so my friends from journalism school often joked. A career that can be underpaid, with long, irregular hours, is sustained only by a fervent passion for the job.</p> <p>But last month, dozens of reporters with less time than that under their belts were forcibly ejected from the industry when two popular independent news outlets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80ad6a32-f091-4005-ad2f-c41c53b8e06d\">Stand News and Citizen News</a>, were closed amid increased pressure from authorities. </p> <p>Journalists broadly decried the “death of free press” in Hong Kong, whose vibrant media scene — at least 15 newspaper titles with a mix of political leanings and more than four news channels for a population of 7.4mn — was once hailed as one of the most freewheeling in Asia.</p> <p>It is not just these recent high-profile closures that have prompted local journalists to lose faith. The ripple effects of the imposition of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/052989fc-2748-4f8e-a2b0-539c32e1ad72\">sweeping national security law</a> by Beijing in 2020 — which led to dozens of pro-democracy activists either being arrested or fleeing the city and the forced closure of more than 50 civil society groups — are still unfolding. Last June the city's biggest pro-democracy tabloid, Apple Daily,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eec04cb-bc7d-497b-9c87-4518355b5fc6\"> was shut down</a> following a police raid and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c58a1697-64b9-44c1-9c06-7cd512f887b4\">the arrest of members</a> of its senior management. </p> <p>“There is no press freedom and the salary is so low, no one would want to enter the industry any more,” says a reporter in her 20s at the Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao. She is switching to a better-paid job in PR.</p> <p>Ming Pao, a centrist outlet where I worked early in my career, also came under attack last month, when a pro-Beijing newspaper accused one of its columnists of “taking over Apple Daily's role to incite” hatred against authorities. At least six young reporters I know at the publication have quit and changed careers over the past six months.</p> <p>Many of the laid off journalists have switched roles. Some became cab drivers or food delivery workers; others have been taking a break or have left Hong Kong.</p> <p>The so-called “red lines” imposed by the security legislation, which bans acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, are so unclear that bosses have been taking precautionary measures, say journalists working in local media. These include an <a href=\"https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E8%A7%80%E9%BB%9E/article/20220120/s00012/1642615248878/%E6%BD%98%E5%BF%97%E7%94%9F-%E7%85%BD%E5%8B%95%E6%AA%A2%E6%8E%A7-%E9%A0%88%E5%85%88%E6%8E%92%E9%99%A4%E3%80%8C%E9%9D%9E%E7%85%BD%E5%8B%95%E6%84%8F%E5%9C%96%E3%80%8D\">unprecedented disclaimer</a> in Ming Pao's opinion section that its articles had “no intention to incite hatred or discontent” against the government.</p> <p>Self-censorship <a href=\"https://www.fcchk.org/membership-survey-on-press-freedom\">is common</a> among both editors and reporters. Veteran journalists seen by some as less hard-hitting have been placed into senior roles at some news outlets. <a href=\"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/21/230192/Now-TV-keeps-low-cop-profile\">Orders were reportedly given</a> by the head of a news channel to remove sensitive pieces from online. Journalists speak about diligent reporters who asked tough questions and <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1589026-20210503.html\">were not offered extensions</a> to their contracts.</p> <p>Senior bureaucrats, such as John Lee, Hong Kong's powerful chief secretary, have waged war against some media outlets, <a href=\"https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202112/29/P2021122900719.htm\">which they deemed</a> “evil elements” and “bad apples”. Yet Carrie Lam, the city's leader, has insisted on multiple occasions that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa6000cc-9f75-456b-bc24-ae8be8eb659e\">press freedom is intact</a>.</p> <p>“It is demotivating,” says a former Apple Daily reporter in his 20s who has been job hunting for months. He believes authorities are attempting to “redefine press freedom” in the territory. For example, more outlets with close links to the government are called on for questions during press conferences.</p> <p>A lot has changed since I started my reporting career. Back in 2012, I witnessed a scene that galvanised my ambition to join the profession: a journalist asked the then-chief executive Leung Chun-ying on his first day on the job if he “would stop answering reporters' questions after getting elected” — prompting the surprised leader to stick around and take questions.</p> <p>Now “every word we use in our questions and stories is being scrutinised under a microscope”, says a young reporter at public broadcaster RTHK who did not want to be named.</p> <p>“One ‘wrong' word could cost us our jobs, or worse, land us in jail. Every time I see a journalist being arrested or a media organisation closing down, I tell myself I have to work harder to do their part as well. But I don't know if that's possible.”</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:thomas.chan@ft.com\"><em>thomas.chan@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Chan Ho-him  2022 'Hong Kong's young journalists decry the ‘death of free press'' FT.com 9 February.
