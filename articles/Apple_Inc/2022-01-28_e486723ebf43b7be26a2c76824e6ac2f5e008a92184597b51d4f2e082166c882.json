  "text": "<p><strong>Capita</strong> will hit its disposal target early after agreeing to sell its IT services division to private equity.</p> <p>The outsourcer plans to sell its Trustmarque division to One Equity Partners for £111m as part of a non-core business disposal programme. Trustmarque had delivered revenue and pre-tax profit of £122m and £16m respectively in 2020, Capita said. </p> <p>The company, which oversees congestion charges in London and collects the BBC licence fee, launched asset sales last March after its ambitious acquisition drive forced multiple profit warnings and a £700m rights issue in 2018. Proceeds from the sale, assuming it completes, will mean Capita will reach a target of £700m in total disposals ahead of the June deadline.</p> <p>Jon Lewis, Capita's chief executive officer, said the sale “marks another significant step towards materially reducing our debt, as we continue to simplify and strengthen&#xa0;Capita, and become a more successful business for the long term.”</p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Asset manager <strong>Abrdn</strong> sold a 4 per cent stake in Phoenix, the insurance group, to raise approximately £264m that it intends to return to shareholders. Abrdn said it had placed the nearly 40m shares overnight at 660p apiece to cut its stake in Phoenix to 10.4 per cent. The companies said their strategic partnership was unaffected by the sale.</p> <p>A drop in passenger numbers over December has led <strong>Heathrow</strong> to cut its 2022 adjusted ebitda target by £307m to £1.04bn. At least 600,000 airport travellers cancelled plans due to the Omicron variant and uncertainty caused by government restrictions, Heathrow said in an investor report update. The group cautioned of a risk to credit covenants if cash flows from passengers are more than 15 per cent below its forecast. </p> <p><strong>Cineworld</strong>'s aborted takeover of rival Cineplex has taken a new twist. The Canadian cinema operator has lodged an appeal for alternative forms damages if the Ontario Court of Appeal determines that the more than $900m it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ddbdde3-b11d-48cf-b8b4-c2f087b2d573\">awarded last year</a> from Cineworld is deemed is incorrect. Cineworld said it will respond to the cross-appeal as part of its ongoing appeal process. </p> <p><strong>Paragon Banking</strong>, the buy-to-let mortgage lender, said trading in the first quarter has been strong and in line with the board's expectations. Total new lending for the quarter rose 35.7 per cent to £708m with new buy-to-let mortgage advances increasing 36.8 per cent to £408.5m, it said.</p> <p><strong>YouGov</strong> expects results for the year ending July to be slightly ahead of the board's expectations after all its divisions and geographies grew in the first half. The polling agency said the improved performance had been driven by custom tracking work and a renewed focus on subscription sales.</p> <p>Ingredients maker <strong>Treatt </strong>said it had made a good start to the new financial year with its order book up strongly year on year.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Shares of the retail brokerage <strong>Robinhood</strong>&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d38bd1d3-1a2f-4367-8f3e-731db590e541\">fell more than 12 per cent</a>&#xa0;in after-hours trading after it missed targets in the final quarter of 2021, as retail trading fervour in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies lost steam.</p> <p><strong>Apple</strong> posted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25450ffe-e080-4f7a-b8d5-94d23d52af77\">record revenue</a> of $123.9bn in the fourth quarter of 2021, an 11 per cent gain from a year before as its services business expanded and chip shortages were largely confined to iPad sales. The iPhone and computer company's net profit in the last three months of the year jumped 20 per cent to $34.6bn, well above forecasts of $31.1bn. Revenue surpassed analysts' expectations of $119bn and the $111.4bn reported a year earlier.</p> <p>US asset manager <strong>Oaktree</strong> is&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbfa3a40-472c-490e-bb47-8958b20889b1\">risking a showdown with Beijing</a>&#xa0;over control of one of ailing property developer Evergrande's most-prized projects in mainland China, a sprawling tourism resort on the Yellow Sea coast called “Venice”.</p> <p>Germany's “immoral and hypocritical” relationship with Russia and China has driven a wedge between western and eastern Europe, Artis Pabriks, <strong>Latvia's defence minister</strong>, told the FT&#xa0;in comments that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25b54dd3-bfed-4768-bc21-96acedc2c24a\">highlighted cracks</a> in the west's unity.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Is Netflix's recent stumble a sign of subscription fatigue, asks <strong>John Gapper</strong>? “If anything, fatigue <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac4261a4-ef39-4fc8-a01a-94894e88000b\">may be worse among media companies</a> than their subscribers,” he writes. “As viewers become more adept at shuffling their subscriptions, companies are having to spend on new films and series to excite them.”</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2022 'Capita sells IT services division Trustmarque for £111m' FT.com 28 January.
