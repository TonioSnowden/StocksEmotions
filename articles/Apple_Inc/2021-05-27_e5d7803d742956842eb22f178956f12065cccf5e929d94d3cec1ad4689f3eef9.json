  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The strategic clarity Chief Executive Jim Farley has brought to Ford will be invaluable as the auto industry undergoes seismic changes in the coming years. </p><p>\n  Mr. Farley, who took the top job in October, pitched the second-largest Detroit auto maker as a technology-driven growth company in his first big investor event Wednesday. The strategy builds on the Wall Street-friendly approach pioneered by General Motors under CEO Mary Barra, but with a sharper focus on commercial customers to reflect Ford Motor's dominance among small and medium-size businesses. </p><p>\n  The most attention-grabbing aspects of the strategy were around electric vehicles: Ford now plans to spend more than $30 billion by 2025 on EVs, which it expects to account for 40% of its global sales by 2030. The pieces in the company's electrification strategy have fallen into place this month: It has struck a deal to make lithium-ion batteries with South Korean supplier SK Innovation; made an investment in next-generation battery startup Solid Power; and launched the all-electric version of its bestselling F-150. </p><p>\n  The plan's more distinctive elements were the creation of a dedicated commercial-vehicle unit to sell both EVs and traditional vehicles to businesses, and a focus on over-the-air software updates. The two are related: Business customers may be earlier than consumers to embrace paying for new services that rely on vehicles' data connections. Ford sees a $20 billion market for such services by 2030. </p><p>\n  Such projections are highly speculative -- the market barely exists yet -- but they form a crucial part of the growth narrative that has re-energized big auto stocks lately. If vehicles can become a constantly upgrading digital sales platform such as the smartphone, then perhaps the likes of Ford can in time persuade investors that they aren't just hardware companies -- as Tesla and Apple have to spectacular effect. </p><p>\n  Software could also help improve vehicle makers' margins. At Ford as elsewhere in the car industry, EVs will come with lower operating margins than traditional cars at first, given the high cost of batteries. The hope is that scaling up, combined with over-the-air updates, will bring new revenue streams as well as reduced costs. \"These aren't electric vehicles, these are digital vehicles,\" Mr. Farley said, who is calling his plan \"Ford+.\" </p><p>\n  The vision may well prove optimistic, but whatever happens, software will likely play a much bigger role in the car industry's future. </p><p>\n  Ford's stock rose 14% Wednesday and is up 21% this month, in a sign that auto investors remain highly focused on tomorrow's technology rather than today's operational problems; Ford has been hit worse than its peers by the chip shortage. The good news for investors is that the stock is still reasonably priced relative to both Ford's own prospective sales and even more so GM's -- a peer it increasingly resembles. Mr. Farley's bold vision might not need to pan out perfectly for shareholders to make further gains. </p><p></p>",
