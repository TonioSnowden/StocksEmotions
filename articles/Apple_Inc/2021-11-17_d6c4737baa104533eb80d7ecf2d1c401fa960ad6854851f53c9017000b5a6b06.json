  "text": "<p>Dozens of tech companies including Google and Apple are being probed by the UK's data protection regulator, after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bed30c91-03b2-4508-b708-8073b5ec8462\">investigation</a> alleged that they were systematically endangering children online and breaching the UK's new Children's Code.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner's Office said on Wednesday it has contacted 40 companies in the areas of social media, gaming and video/music streaming to investigate their interactions with children, including location tracking, personalising content or advertising, and serving up behavioural nudges, such as automatically playing videos. </p> <p>“We are focusing our interventions on . . . online services where there is information which indicates potential poor compliance with privacy requirements, and where there is a high risk of potential harm to children,” said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. </p> <p>Apple and Google were not among the original cohort contacted in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/705e0468-bfcf-4f5d-b777-c25785d950cb\">the audit</a> that the ICO launched in August.</p> <p>In a letter to 5Rights, the children's digital rights charity that conducted the investigation in October, Denham said she has contacted them to “enquire about the extent to which the risks associated with processing personal data are a factor in determining the age rating for an app”.</p> <p>Denham said she had contacted a further seven companies featured in the charity's report, but did not disclose their names. She said the ICO expects to take further formal action in spring of 2022, once it has scrutinised its findings early next year. </p> <p>The research identified 12 areas of persistent failure and asked the information commissioner to take action, said Baroness Beeban Kidron, 5Rights' chair and the member of the House of Lords who originally proposed the code. “Today we are delighted that she has made that commitment and that the ICO is taking action in the spring.”</p> <p>The UK's Age Appropriate Design Code (or Children's Code), which came into force in August after a year's grace period for companies to comply, has been touted as a pioneering piece of regulation.</p> <p>Breaches of the code carry the same potential penalties as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including a fine of up to 4 per cent of global turnover for companies that do not comply.</p> <p>The 5Rights <a href=\"https://5rightsfoundation.com/in-action/letter-to-the-ico-breaches-of-the-age-appropriate-design-code.html\">report</a> pointed out that app stores have age ratings on individual apps that are inconsistent with an app's own age bar, and in some cases no age ratings at all. </p> <p>The research alleged that app store owners Google and Apple did not do enough to prevent underage users from downloading age-inappropriate apps from their stores. </p> <p>Baroness Kidron added: “This is potentially enormous, because it is widespread. They have an immense power in the marketplace, they should be acting appropriately.”</p> <p>Members of the US Senate and Congress have called on major US tech and gaming companies to voluntarily adopt the ICO's code for American children, after Baroness Kidron gave evidence in the US Congress earlier this year. </p> <p>She added that she would consider making further formal complaints about those companies that fail to heed the ICO's warning by next spring.</p> <p>Google said it regularly engages with the ICO and will continue to do so. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Source: Madhumita Murgia in London 2021 'Google and Apple among tech groups probed by ICO on endangering children' FT.com 17 November.
