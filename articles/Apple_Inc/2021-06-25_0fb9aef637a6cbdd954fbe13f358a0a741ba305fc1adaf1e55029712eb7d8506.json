The iPhone, as you might imagine, looks pretty dull rendered in pen-line but streamlined Art Deco pencil sharpeners, a jukebox, the Coca-Cola bottle, a Wiener-shaped hot dog van and Prince's guitar look pretty cool. Wonderful to idly leaf through.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/3869224002?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=3869224002\"><strong>Architectural Guide</strong></a><strong>: Sub-Saharan Africa</strong><br>edited by Philipp Meuser and Adil Dalbai, <em>Dom €148</em></p> <p>These colourfully covered seven volumes help fill the Africa-sized void in the literature of architecture. Despite the title it's a bit chunky to drag around the continent with you but with contributions from 350 critics and specialists covering 49 countries, it is a substantial achievement. Spanning everything from vernacular to colonial architectures, through post-independence modern and contemporary works, it makes for a fascinating guide to an undeservedly unfamiliar terrain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1789142741?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1789142741\"><strong>Amplified</strong></a><strong>: A Design History of the Electric Guitar</strong><br>by Paul Atkinson, <em>Reaktion £25</em></p> <p>There are plenty of books on electric guitars but very few consider them as industrial design products. Yet models such as the Fender Stratocaster or Gibson's Flying V have become part of the visual language of contemporary culture, bizarrely enduring designs that seem somehow not to have dated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241396735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0241396735\"><strong>Architecture</strong></a><strong>: From Prehistory to Climate Emergency</strong><br>by Barnabas Calder, <em>Pelican £20</em></p> <p>Despite its title this is not so much as a history of architecture as a survey of construction and its entanglement with energy use. A superb idea that outlines how, say, the form of a terraced house was enabled by the coal that fired its bricks, the lime in its mortar and the smelted iron in its railings, fanlight and fireplaces. The energy transfer from manpower (the slavery of the ancient Romans or Egyptians, for instance) to fossil fuels (concrete, trucks, plastics) is well-told through a compelling lens.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/383650135X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=383650135X\"><strong>Gio Ponti</strong></a><br>edited by Karl Koblitz, <em>Taschen £200</em></p> <p>Another insanely huge book from the masters of the reinforced coffee-table genre, this is an absolute beauty about the refined <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/802950c0-e6d3-43b6-a44c-4e7fc2c44df6\">Italian architect-designer</a> who defined a vein of elegant, uncontroversial mid-century chic. Lacking the radicalism of some of his most modernist contemporaries, Ponti concentrated on style, merging the historical with the fashionable, the lightness of modernism with the substance of history. Not a beach book but lovely, perhaps, to flip through in a Mediterranean villa.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Edwin Heathcote 2021 'Summer books of 2021: Architecture and design' FT.com 25 June.
