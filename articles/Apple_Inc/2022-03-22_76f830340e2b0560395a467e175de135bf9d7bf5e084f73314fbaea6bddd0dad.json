  "title": "Something Joe Biden Hasn't Forgotten; Jamie Dimon's mistake is now a lever for the President to demand more corporate climate spending.",
  "text": "<p>The Business Roundtable's rewrite was a mistake because serving the long-term interests of shareholders necessarily requires executives to treat non-owners fairly—to attract and retain a talented workforce, to provide good value for consumers, to deal reasonably with suppliers, and to respect the laws and customs wherever a business operates. On the other hand, \"stakeholders\" are often activists pursuing political agendas that they couldn't persuade voters to approve and for which they won't have to pay. There's no good reason to elevate their gripes above the interests of customers, workers, owners and voters. Milton Friedman, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize in economics, explained more than half a century ago the flaws in declarations like Mr. Dimon's:</p><p>What does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a \"social responsibility\" in his capacity as businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he is to act in some way that is not in the interest of his employers.</p><p>Unfortunately Mr. Biden doesn't seem to want to let the Business Roundtable off with pure rhetoric. He visited the organization's Washington office on Monday and after urging the assembled CEOs to prepare for possible Russian cyberattacks, he brought up the Dimon declaration. According to the official White House transcript Mr. Biden said:</p><p>In 2019, your organizations realized — or, excuse me, released a statement with a signature of almost everyone in this room. And it says, quote, \"America deserves an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity, and to lead a life of meaning and dignity.\" And it expressed a commitment from you to invest in your workforce and support local communities. It wasn't a do-gooder statement; it was a capitalist statement. We're all capitalists in this room. And you did the right thing, in my view, in the assertion of that statement.</p><p>This was your view about how to run strong, profitable companies over the long term. And this commitment of consequence and pear- — for — prepare for the free world is vital that you reaffirm that commitment, in my humble opinion.</p><p>We can't afford to prioritize shareholders at the expense of your stakeholders, the environment, your workers, your customers, your communities where they live and work. And you're not doing that, but I think the inclination — would be inclined to do that on some occasions.</p><p>As usual, one can never be entirely sure what Mr. Biden was trying to say. Also, his claim of being a capitalist is suspect given what we've learned since 2020 about Biden family business, which sure doesn't look like the free market at work. But the point is that Mr. Biden hasn't forgotten the corporate rhetoric. He went on to urge the CEOs to take a number of actions, including:</p><p>... to invest in America itself — in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy — so America can win the competition in the 21st century.</p><p>And it won't hurt your bottom lines or the economy. It helps continue us — it'll help us grow while lowering costs and lowering the deficit.</p><p>Mr. Biden remembers the 2019 Business Roundtable statement, but it seems he has somehow already forgotten the problem countries like Germany created for themselves by embracing expensive green energy fantasies that left them reliant on Russian fuel. He also seems to have forgotten how the sticker shock from his multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better plan caused moderate senators to reject the bill with its costly climate measures.</p><p>Mr. Biden appears to be claiming that a massive transition away from fossil fuels is not just cost-free but actually a savings generator for shareholders and taxpayers. Of course if this were true there would be no need for his climate agenda—or for him to pressure CEOs to translate a vague statement into corporate spending.</p><p>***</p><p>Maybe You Can Fight City Hall</p><p>Among the last of the bitter-enders forcing children to cover their faceshas announced his intention to give up the fight. Bernadette Hogan and Sam Raskin report in the New York Post:</p><p>Children 4 years old and younger will soon no longer be required to wear masks in public schools and day care facilities, Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday, following weeks of pressure to nix the controversial rule.</p><p>During a press conference, Adams said the face-covering mandate for the Big Apple's youngest will be removed beginning April 4, if current COVID-19 trends persist.</p><p>\"If the numbers continue to show a low level of risk, masks will be optional for 2- to 4-year-old students in schools and day care,\" he told reporters at City Hall. \"We want to see our babies' faces.\"</p><p>\"Now it's time to peel back another layer.\"</p><p>There wasnever a good time for covering our babies' faces, and thank goodness the mask mandates are finally coming to an end. Thanks especially to the persistence of sensible citizens. Two days ago the Post's Reuven Fenton, Jackie Salo and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon reported:</p><p>More than 100 parents and their kids packed City Hall Park on Sunday to rally against Mayor Eric Adams' mask mandate for children ages 4 and younger — demanding the city \"unmask our toddlers.\"</p><p>The protest was the just latest example of the vehement pushback from Big Apple parents who want City Hall to do away with the regulation on youngsters, given local plummeting COVID-19 rates and high vaccination levels among the much more vulnerable older set.</p><p>\"[The mandate] is not following the science. This is making a mockery of the science. This is playing us for fools,'' said rally-goer Daniela Jampel, a 38-year-old mother of three, including a 4-year-old in public pre-K, from Washington Heights.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>Something Joe Biden Hasn't Forgotten</p>",
