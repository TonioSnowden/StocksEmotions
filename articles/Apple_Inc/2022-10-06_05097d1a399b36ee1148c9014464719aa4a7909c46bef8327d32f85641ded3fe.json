  "text": "<p>Pixel devices are relatively niche, especially when compared with top-selling lines from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. Pixels make up around 2% of smartphone shipments in North America, but—following last year's arrival of the Pixel 6 and its custom Tensor chip—the company's market share is growing. According to the data-analytics company Canalys, shipments more than tripled in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. That growth comes as the once-hot global smartphone market overall is cooling.</p><p>\"It's not an easy industry, but we see a lot of growth ahead,\" said Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of devices and services. The popularity of Google services, he said, gives Pixel an edge.</p><p>Along with this week's mobile-device news, Google announced updates to its Nest smart-home products. It introduced a second-generation Nest Doorbell ($180), which relies on the home's electrical system instead of an internal battery, resulting in a 30% smaller size. The company also unveiled a faster Nest Wi-Fi router (starting at $200) with support for Wi-Fi 6E, the latest high-capacity, high-speed standard for wireless networks.</p><p>Pixel 7 and 7 Pro</p><p>Both the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro come with Google's second-generation Tensor G2 chip that's faster than the chip in last year's models. In Extreme Battery Saver mode, Google says both phones can last up to 72 hours on a single charge, an improvement on the previous 48-hour rating.</p><p>Google is reintroducing Face Unlock, after the feature was missing in the Pixel 5 and 6. The devices also have an under-display fingerprint sensor, which you can use to unlock the phone and authenticate payments. Both new Pixels will get at least five years of guaranteed security updates from Google.</p><p>They have a new look as well. A sleek aluminum camera housing on the rear replaces the previous generation's Cyclops-esque black bar.</p><p>On the back, the Pixel 7 has the same wide and ultrawide cameras as the previous generation, but the Tensor G2 chip can help deliver better zoom. It also facilitates functionality first seen on the Pixel 6, such as the ability to remove unwanted people or objects, and the Real Tone image-processing algorithm tuned to capture darker complexions.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What would get you to switch to a Pixel phone?Join the conversation below.</p><p>The Pixel 7 Pro has an additional telephoto camera for zoomed-in shots, capable of 5X optical zoom, up from 4X in last year's Pixel. The 7 Pro's new Macro Focus feature can take super close-up shots.</p><p>There are a few features coming later this year I'm looking forward to testing: Clear Calling—which quiets down the background noises of phone calls—and labels for audio transcriptions, to identify who is speaking in the voice recorder app.</p><p>Pixel Watch</p><p>The Pixel Watch is the first significant manifestation of Google's $2.1 billion acquisition of the fitness-band maker Fitbit, which was wrapped up last year. The wearables market is dominated by the Apple Watch for iPhone owners. The new Fitbit-infused Pixel Watch ($350 for Bluetooth and $400 for Bluetooth plus cellular) is hoping to be the go-to smartwatch for Android users.</p><p>The smartwatch has a round, always-on touch-screen display, a side dial and a side button. An onboard microphone is listening for \"Hey Google\" to activate the virtual assistant. There are apps for smart-home controls, a shutter to remotely trigger the Pixel's camera, and Google Wallet for contactless payments. With the cellular model, you don't need your phone nearby to receive texts and calls, or use services including Google Maps and YouTube Music.</p><p>As with the Apple Watch, the Pixel Watch is as much a health device as it is a phone companion. It runs a Fitbit app capable of workout and sleep tracking. It has a blood- oxygen sensor and an optical sensor that provides what Google calls \"Fitbit's most accurate heart-rate tracking yet.\" There is GPS for outdoor activity tracking. The device is water-resistant, up to 50 meters deep (about 164 feet) for 10 minutes. A fall-detection feature will come to the Pixel Watch in a future software release.</p><p>The Pixel Watch is rated for battery life up to 24 hours, but it's likely shorter when using activity tracking, which requires energy-intensive GPS.</p><p>The Pixel Watch is compatible with phones running Android 8 or newer. Google is guaranteeing three years of software updates. It's powered by Google's Wear OS platform for wearables.</p><p>While some Wear OS watches pair with iPhones with limited functionality, the Pixel Watch won't at all. But perhaps that's for the best, since Wear OS is optimized for Android phones.</p><p>With the watch, Google is expanding its suite of Pixel companion products, which also includes the Pixel Buds Pro earbuds and a large-screen Pixel tablet slated for next year. Could the Apple-style ecosystem approach woo a few Samsung or iPhone loyalists to the Pixel brand? We'll first have to test how well these devices work together, so stay tuned.</p><p>Joanna Stern, Miles Kruppa and Dalvin Brown contributed to this article.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com</p><p>Google Expands Its Hardware With New Pixel Watch, Pixel 7 and 7 Pro Phones</p>",
