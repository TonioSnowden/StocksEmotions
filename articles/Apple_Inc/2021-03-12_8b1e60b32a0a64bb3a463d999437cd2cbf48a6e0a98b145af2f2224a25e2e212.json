  "title": "Stock-Picking  Funds Trailed  Market Again  ----  By Karen Langley",
  "text": "<p>   In a year prime for stock picking, stock pickers came up short -- again. </p><p>   In 2020, 60% of U.S. large-cap stock-picking funds lagged behind the benchmark S&amp;P 500, according to new data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. </p><p>   Last year's market tumult was unprecedented: As Covid-19 spread, the benchmark U.S. index lost a third of its value in less than five weeks in February and March, before leaping higher to set new highs in August and ending the year with double-digit gains. </p><p>   But the failure of most stock-picking funds to beat benchmark indexes was nothing new: 2020 was the 11th consecutive year in which a majority of actively managed U.S. large-cap funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices' year-end scorecard on active management. </p><p>   One factor that might have contributed to the difficulty of beating the market last year was the resounding performance of big technology stocks, which exert a powerful force on the S&amp;P 500. The broad U.S. stock index's 16% gain for the year was propelled by an 81% surge in shares of Apple Inc. and a 76% climb in shares of Amazon.com Inc. </p><p>   \"The dominance of really large stocks creates difficulties for active managers,\" said Craig Lazzara, global head of index investment strategy for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \"You would have to have a bigger position than most active managers are comfortable with if you were going to maintain overweights in the biggest stocks,\" he said. </p><p>   At the end of December, Apple accounted for 6.7% of the S&amp;P 500, while Amazon made up 4.4%. </p><p>   This year has been a different story so far, with tech stocks lagging behind the market as investors snap up shares of energy and financial companies in a bet on broader economic growth. While the S&amp;P 500 is up 3.8% in 2021, Apple and Amazon shares are down. </p><p>   Among the three biggest actively managed U.S. large-cap funds at the end of last year, 2020 performance was mixed, according to data from Morningstar Direct. Class A shares of American Funds The Growth Fund of America -- a $256 billion fund at the end of December -- posted a return of 38% in 2020, outperforming the 18% total return of the S&amp;P 500 and the 33% total return of the S&amp;P 500 Growth index. </p><p>   The oldest share class of Fidelity Contrafund Fund, which was also categorized as a growth fund by Morningstar, had a return slightly under 33%, beating the S&amp;P 500 but trailing the growth index. Class A shares of American Funds Washington Mutual Investors Fund posted an annual return of 7.7%, lagging behind the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   Active managers did somewhat better in choosing midcap and small-cap stocks, with 51% and 46% of funds in those categories underperforming their respective S&amp;P benchmarks. </p><p>   Stock picking could have more opportunity for success in areas like small-caps, where companies often receive less scrutiny than their larger peers, said Sarah Samuels, director of investment manager research at NEPC, an investment consulting firm. \"Smaller-cap names are less well-covered by analysts,\" she said. \"It's not as efficient, and therefore you should be able to add more value.\" </p><p>   Stock-picking strategies geared toward fast-growing companies or low-price value shares also were relative bright spots last year. More than half of large-cap growth funds and large-cap value funds -- 62% and 67%, respectively -- outperformed their benchmarks. </p><p>   Over the long run, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices found that most U.S. equity funds, regardless of category, fail to beat the relevant stock index. Of the U.S. large-cap funds that were in business 20 years ago, 6% are both still operating and have beaten the S&amp;P 500 over that time, according to the report. </p><p>   At the end of 2019, $4.6 trillion was indexed to the S&amp;P 500 in passively managed funds, while $6.6 trillion was benchmarked to the index in actively managed funds. </p><p></p>",
