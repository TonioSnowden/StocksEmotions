If the 2022 Forte is anything like the 2021 model, we fully expect it to provide a civilized driving experience right from the entry-level model upward.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:The supply-chain disaster is actually good news — for these 3 reasons</p><p>The Forte is available in four trim levels that include FE, LXS, GT-Line, and GT. The revamped lineup sees the EX model discontinued. A new GT-Line Sport Premium package joins the lineup.</p><p>The base Forte comes equipped with a 147-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with a continuously variable automatic transmission.

It can be equipped with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p><p>Adding upgrades to smartphone integration and advanced safety features only boosts the 2022 Kia Forte's value. These add-ons include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility and a suite of driver new driver assists. Among them are standard lane following assist along with available highway driving assist and navigation-based smart cruise control. Other standard assists feature driver attention warning, forward-collision avoidance and warning, and lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist.</p><p>Read: What to expect when returning a leased car</p><p>Honda Civic</p><p>With this all-new 2022 Honda Civic, the company says it has revisited some “timeless design concepts” from previous Civics. Notable among these are a low hood, front fenders, and beltline, which create an expansive greenhouse and a superb outward view.</p><p>The front-wheel-drive (FWD) Civic chassis sports a wheelbase that has grown by 1.4 inches, which helps to create a roomier back seat and a smoother ride. While the new Civic hatchback could have been made to look more like a wagon, Honda instead gave it a coupe-like roofline while retaining good rear headroom.</p><p>The 2022 Civic is the 11th generation and gets slightly better fuel economy and upgraded suspension to be sporty but comfortable, with upgrades that improve steering response and reduce shock over bumpy surfaces like railroad crossings. In the back, the track has been widened a half-inch for added stability, while new bushings significantly reduce the intrusion of any noise or vibration into the 5-seat cabin.</p><p>Also see:These are the cars that cost the most and least to insure</p><p>Look for a sporty Honda Civic Si to arrive after the Civic hatchback, and an even sportier Honda Civic Type R to debut in 2022. Both will be fitted exclusively with 6-speed manual transmissions.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Front-wheel drive; fuel economy; CVT transmissions; available manuals; upscale interiors.</p><p>2022 Kia Forte advantages</p><p>Standard wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto; available 7-speed dual-clutch automatic; affordable pricing; long warranty.</p><p>2022 Honda Civic advantages</p><p>More base power; high-performance Type R option; strong resale value.</p><p>Which is right for me?</p><p>The 2022 Kia Forte is a mainstream compact car with a bit of upscale flair.
