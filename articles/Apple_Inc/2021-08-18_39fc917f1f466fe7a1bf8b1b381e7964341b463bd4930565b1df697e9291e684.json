  "text": "<p>(Hulu)</p><p>In the second episode \"Nine Perfect Strangers,\" a wellness guru played by Nicole Kidman asks the participants of her 10-day retreat to dig shallow graves, lie down, imagine that they are dead, and to think about \"the things that stop you from having a full and extraordinary life.\"</p><p>\"I have to say, you show up to that set and there are all those graves dug, there is something confronting about getting inside of a hole and laying there,\" says Bobby Cannavale, who plays a former football player addicted to pain pills.</p><p>The series, based on a novel by Liane Moriarty, premieres Wednesday on Hulu. It explores the lives of nine guests who are thrown together, including couples struggling with relationship issues, grieving parents and unhappy professionals. Ms. Kidman's Masha Dmitrichenko, the owner of the resort who uses nontraditional methods, begins receiving threatening messages herself.</p><p>Mr. Cannavale says he was drawn to the series both because it would be a unique experience as an actor, but also for the viewer.</p><p>\"To hear her say those things and to walk you through what the exercise is,\" he says of the grave scene, for example, \"I think can be confronting for the viewer as well.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Chapelwaite'</p><p>(Epix, Epix Now)</p><p>In \"Chapelwaite,\" a new 10-part drama that premieres Sunday on Epix and the Epix Now streaming service, Adrien Brody plays Capt. Charles Boone, a recently widowed husband, a father of three and the inheritor of a large family home and sawmill in Preacher's Corner, Maine, in the mid-1800s.</p><p>Though the Captain and his children are new arrivals to Preacher's Corner, their name and family home, Chapelwaite, have long been associated with darkness and have recently been blamed for a mysterious illness making its way through town. Once they settle in and hire a governess—played by Emily Hampshire of \"Schitt's Creek\"—the family develops its own suspicions about the home.</p><p>The series is based on Stephen King's short story \"Jerusalem's Lot.\" Mr. Brody says that when he read the script, he was taken by Boone's complex character as a tortured man and father who fights for his children, but who is also not a caricature of a hero. He isn't, Mr. Brody notes, without fear.</p><p>\"All those imperfections need to be captured in a depiction of the heroic character,\" he says. \"And more often than not, they're not incorporated on that level. And I feel like I was given quite a lot of breadth to represent all of that within Charles Boone.\"</p><p>New Release: 'The Chair'</p><p>( Netflix )</p><p>When Dr. Ji-Yoon Kim takes over as the head of a university's English department, her staff includes professors who don't think the first woman (and one of the faculty's rare persons of color) can lead the department and eager professors—both young and veteran—anxious for change.</p><p>Played by Sandra Oh, Dr. Kim also has to contend with Jay Duplass's Bill Dobson. The former chair of the department is now her subordinate, his life is in shambles, he is still dining out on his early success, and he doesn't think their professional relationship should get in the way of an intimate one.</p><p>\"The Chair,\" a new six-part, three-hour dramatic comedy that premieres Friday on Netflix, was co-created and largely written by Amanda Peet. Best known for her roles in movies like \"Syriana\" and \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and TV shows like \"Brockmire,\" Ms. Peet says she was drawn to the idea of women and women of color who go first.</p><p>\"I was really interested in: What is it like to have to do the actual job itself, but then on top of that to have to navigate all of this subliminal and sometimes overt shit that's being thrown at you?\" she says.</p><p>Streaming Notes</p><p>• More Physical: Apple TV+'s \"Physical,\" starring Rose Byrne as a 1980s housewife who becomes an aerobics pioneer, has been picked up for a second season. Mr. Cannavale, Ms. Byrne's longtime partner, says that while she was preparing for the role he never knew when she had be practicing. So, he would come home from work and find her using the living room as an aerobics studio.</p><p>\"It was very funny to watch that progress,\" he says, \"because she'd be the first one to tell you, she's not like a natural mover, let's say. She came a long way.\"</p><p>• More Well: To read about a spate of new series, podcasts and books focused on the art of the wellness takedown, click here.</p><p>• More Ted: Why did Ted Lasso drop a Christmas episode in August?
