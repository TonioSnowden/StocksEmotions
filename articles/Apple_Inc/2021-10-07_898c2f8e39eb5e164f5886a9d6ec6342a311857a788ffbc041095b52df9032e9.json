  "text": "<p>There are few things executives in the gossipy top echelons of the media industry love more than schadenfreude. And in recent years, there has been no shortage of hot-new-things-in media that have stumbled in their attempts to take advantage of the digitalisation of the industry and challenge incumbents.</p> <p>To varying degrees, Quibi, Mic and Vice are just some of the upstarts who failed to live up to initial hype. But the implosion of Ozy Media this month has eclipsed all those in sudden drama.</p> <p>The much-derided short video platform Quibi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc87e3bc-1f25-4c6d-a8be-0b82bd4aee38\">dissolved </a>over several months. Ozy took about a week to crash after the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/media/ozy-media-goldman-sachs.html\">published </a>a column that raised questions about its audience figures and revealed a bizarre incident in which its chief operating officer impersonated a YouTube executive on a call to raise $40m from Goldman Sachs. Los Angeles investment group Lifeline Legacy Holdings, an investor in Ozy, has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ozy-media-investor-sues-the-company-for-fraud-86d7aca3-d0fa-415f-b562-afa324300731.html\">filed</a> a lawsuit accusing the company of “fraudulent conduct”.</p> <p>Beyond the brazenness of the fundraising incident itself, a central question quickly emerged. How did so many high-profile investors end up buying into this company? They <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a3e5d89-9790-3d5a-bca0-b9ead1b2b143\">include</a> billionaire philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs; publishing company Axel Springer; and David Drummond, Google's former chief legal officer. </p> <p>Marc Lasry, the billionaire investor, was among those that quickly left the scene last week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d8490fd-9cc8-4f26-8bcf-7752f5beb136\">quitting</a> as chair of Ozy after only three weeks in the role, citing his lack of experience in “areas like crisis management”.</p> <p>Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, says the Ozy implosion underscores how common “celebrity” boards still are. “Anytime you have a domineering CEO who wishes to accomplish respectability, they will look for folks whose names give them credibility,” he says. </p> <p>Ozy's backers were drawn by a seductive narrative outlined by a charismatic chief executive in the form of Carlos Watson, a former MSNBC anchor and Goldman Sachs banker.</p> <p>When it fetched a $120m valuation on launch in 2013, Ozy billed itself as targeting the “Change Generation”. That chimed with the wave of challenges to traditional media at the time, led by the likes of BuzzFeed and Vice. When Vice founder Shane Smith in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2db3cc4-0664-11e3-9bd9-00144feab7de\">2013 lured $70m </a>in investment from Rupert Murdoch, he told the media mogul: “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61c51d64-4a9c-11e2-968a-00144feab49a\">I have the future, you have the past</a>”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Watson and his team built out an operation encompassing a website, YouTube videos, podcasts, newsletters and numerous partnerships with established media brands. Until Ozy's fall, the Financial Times had an agreement to swap some advertising space with the company.</p> <p>Led by Watson, a 52-year-old African American, Ozy also provided a digestible way for investors and advertisers to channel their money towards “diverse” businesses. “So much of their recent successes were in the context of marketers trying to expand to diverse media,” said a senior executive at a major ad buying agency.</p> <p>How successful Ozy had been before its fall is not clear. Watson earlier this year said the company had turned a profit on $50m in revenue in 2020, driven by lucrative television deals. However, the story Ozy sold to these groups, of its underlying popularity, has been called into question. The New York Times questioned Ozy's claim in 2019 that it reached 50m unique users a month and compared that to data from ComScore, which showed figures at a fraction of that level.</p> <p>Ozy's circumstances are unique. But it is not alone among contemporaries that have not lived up to the hopes of their once-enthusiastic backers. Verizon invested in AwesomenessTV in 2016 at a $650m valuation, only for the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e842ce60-91d4-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421\">to be sold</a> two years later for less than $50m. Disney wrote down its investment in Vice Media by $353m. Mic was valued in 2017 at $100m, only for Bustle to buy the property for $5m a year later. </p> <p>Watson was still holding out hope of an Ozy comeback this week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0434ebf-d790-4562-b88c-44b08015b3c7\">saying</a> that the company would keep running. “This is our Lazarus moment,” he told the&#xa0;<em>Today</em>&#xa0;show. &#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/carlos-watson-ozy-interview-relaunch-board-members-6467e469-080e-446f-b0b0-6b15699294f3.html\">Employees</a> who had lost their jobs just days earlier called the attempt “delusional”. </p> <p>There are precedents for revivals. Gossip site Gawker relaunched this year and just this week, the dust barely settled from the Ozy implosion, Mic<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/business/media/mic-relaunch.html\"> announced a revamp. </a>But in Ozy's case, there appears to be so many outstanding questions that need to be clarified about how it operated before a comeback could even be considered. </p> <p><em>anna.nicolaou@ft.com</em></p><p>Source: Anna Nicolaou 2021 'Questions mount after the fall of Ozy Media' FT.com 7 October.
