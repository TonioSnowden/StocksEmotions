Jim Cramer declares the bear market is over.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Investors remained focused on developments surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, the Financial Times reported that Russia is no longer demanding Ukraine be “denazified” in ceasefire talks, giving investors reason for optimism that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be willing to settle for less in ceasefire talks than previously expected.Russia has tried to justify its invasion of Ukraine, by claiming without evidence that the democratic country is run by fascists. Talks between the two sides are due to resume in full in Turkey on Tuesday. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia.</p><p>Read:Zelensky pushes peace ‘without delay,' and wants to talk to Putin face-to-face</p><p>Late last week, Moscow signaled it was shifting its war aims to focus on the eastern half of the country, though Russian forces continued to rain missiles on Ukrainian cities, news reports said. Western officials saw few signs that Russia was willing to seek a peaceful resolution, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday.</p><p>“If you think about how the equity market is trading, it's pricing in some resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” Jack McIntyre of Brandywine Global Investment Management said by phone. “If Russia-Ukraine becomes less of an issue, the focus is going to shift to the Fed and the idea of liquidity being withdrawn.”</p><p>Traders were also looking at news from the world's No. 2 economy, China, which locked down its financial capital, Shanghai, in response to rising COVID-19 cases. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLK22 declined by $7.94, or about 7%, to settle at $105.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on related demand worries.</p><p>Bond trading remained volatile, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y temporarily moving further above 2.50% before pulling back as buyers returned to government debt. The global bond market is heading for its worst returns since the Marshall Plan was implemented after World War II.</p><p>Meanwhile, the yield curve continues to flatten, a potential signal that investors fear an economic slowdown. The 5-year Treasury yield briefly traded above the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond, temporarily inverting that measure of the curve. The 2-year yield remains below the 10-year yield, but a rise above the longer-term rate would be seen as signaling a possible recession.</p><p>“Our base case is that the US economy can avoid a recession, lowering the threat of a sustained downtrend in stocks,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. “Investors should brace for higher rates — including potentially adding exposure to value and financial stocks which tend to outperform as central bank policy tightens — without overreacting by exiting equity markets.”</p><p>“We favor selected equity overweight and underweight positions, resulting in a neutral overall stance on the asset class,” he said.</p><p>In One Chart:Some stock market ‘complacency creeping in' after S&amp;P 500's ‘near-perfect retracement' of selloff</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Tesla Inc. shares TSLA finished 8% higher after the electric vehicle giant disclosed plans to enable a stock split, which would be the second in two years.</p><p>Shares of Apple Inc.
