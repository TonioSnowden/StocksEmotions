  "text": "<p>Twitter's confidential June settlement was related to Mr. Zatko's lost compensation and followed monthslong mediation over tens of millions of dollars in potential pay, the people said. Such compensation agreements aren't unusual when an executive departs a company prematurely and leaves behind potential stock options and other money.</p><p>As part of the settlement, Mr. Zatko agreed to a nondisclosure agreement that forbids him from speaking publicly about his time at Twitter or disparaging the company, the people said. Congressional hearings and governmental whistleblower complaints are two of the few venues in which he is permitted to speak openly, they said, and such exemptions are typical in compensation settlements.</p><p>Mr. Zatko is set to testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to discuss his allegations of security failures at Twitter. The same day, Twitter shareholders are being asked to vote on Mr. Musk's proposed takeover of the social-media company.</p><p>An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Popular stories from WSJ.com:</p><p>* Fed on Path for Another 0.75-Point Interest-Rate Lift After Powell's Inflation Pledge</p><p>* Police, Car Owners Wrestle With Growing Thefts of Kias, Hyundais</p><p>* Apple Unveils iPhone 14 Lineup</p><p>Twitter agreed to pay whistleblower $7 million in June settlement</p>",
