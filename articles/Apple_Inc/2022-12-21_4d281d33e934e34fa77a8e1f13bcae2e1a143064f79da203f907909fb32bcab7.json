  "text": "<p>Terms being discussed for the agreement couldn't immediately be learned. Satellite broadcaster DirecTV currently pays $1.5 billion annually for Sunday Ticket rights, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Sunday Ticket allows subscribers to view all \"out of market\" Sunday afternoon games, meaning games that don't involve their local teams.</p><p>A potential move of Sunday Ticket to YouTube is further evidence of major sports migrating from traditional TV, which has been hit by cord-cutting, to streaming and tech companies who are willing to spend heavily on content. Amazon.com Inc. has its own NFL deal, while Apple Inc. streams some Major League Baseball games and has a new deal for Major League Soccer.</p><p>The addition of Sunday Ticket would provide a boost to YouTube's streaming efforts as the video platform attempts to broaden beyond advertising sales into subscription revenue.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</p><p>Updates to follow as news develops.</p><p>NFL in Advanced Talks With Google's YouTube for 'Sunday Ticket' Rights Deal</p>",
