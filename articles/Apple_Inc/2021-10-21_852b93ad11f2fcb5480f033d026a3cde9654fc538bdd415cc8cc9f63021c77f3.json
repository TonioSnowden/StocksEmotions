  "text": "<p>One of the most romantic moments I ever witnessed happened in a supermarket in the ready-made sauces aisle. It was before the pandemic, when grocery shopping could be a fun date rather than something done masked and alone. A young woman and man paused to look at the shelves of bottled sauces: pasta sauces, Thai green curry sauce and the like. The woman turned tenderly to the man and said, \"You have spoiled me for sauce.\" What she meant—it became clear, as I eavesdropped—was that the sauces he cooked for her were so delicious that she could no longer enjoy the ready-made ones in a jar.</p><p>Every cook seems to have their own rules about which foods should always be prepared fresh and which are better bought, whether from a shop or restaurant. Some of these rules are cultural, some are personal and some are generational. It is a rare person now who makes their own ketchup (frankly, why bother?), but pickle-making is on the rise among the young.</p><p>In the 1980s, my mother used to grind her own meat, using a hefty metal mincing machine screwed onto the kitchen table, but she was happy to buy her soup in cans: cream of tomato, cream of mushroom, cream of chicken. I'm the other way around, as much a creature of my times as my mother was of hers. I make my soups fresh (to my disappointment, I no longer enjoy canned soup, even for nostalgia's sake) but think nothing of buying ready-ground meat. This is partly because I don't own a mincing machine but do own a stick blender, which makes soup-making a cinch.</p><p>How do we decide which foods to make from scratch and which to buy? We each have our own mental barriers about foods that are too intimidating to prepare, but once tried, the homemade version will often spoil you for the packaged version. In my experience, people treat you as some kind of genius if you serve them home-made pesto or flatbreads even though both of these are the work of a few minutes if you have the ingredients. I think it's because the packaged varieties of these foods are now so ubiquitous that we imagine them to be much trickier to make than they actually are.</p><p>There are plenty of traditional food cultures where making staples from scratch—from cheese to bread—is less of a big deal than it tends to be in the West. One of the kings of DIY food is fermentation expert Sandor Katz. In his latest masterpiece, \"Sandor Katz's Fermentation Journeys,\" he travels the world in search of delicious fermented things, from pickles to tofu to kimchi. One food that is definitely always a \"buy\" for me is vinegar, but Mr. Katz's description of making Japanese persimmon vinegar was so inviting that he made me want to try it (although I may not have the patience given that the recipe takes 2 or 3 months to mature).</p><p>Few things are more exciting as a cook than the moment when you discover that a food you believed you had to buy is no trouble to make. \"I'm not the sort of person who would ever make their own cranberry sauce,\" you say. But then you try it and find that the task of pouring fresh cranberries and sugar and water into a pan and heating the crimson berries until they burst is scarcely more sweat than opening a can (and so much more delicious). From here, it might be a short step to making your own jam.</p><p>One of the bestselling cookbooks in the U.S. this fall has been \"An Unapologetic Cookbook\" by a young chef named Joshua Weissman, who is trying to persuade us to make more foods, from mayo to chicken stock, instead of buying them. Mr. Weissman's argument is that \"you don't know how much better something can be until you make it.\" To this end, he offers foolproof recipes for various items that most of us would categorize as foods to buy, from chicken nuggets to graham crackers to hot sauce to butter. He even makes his own ladyfingers: spongy cookies that form the basis of tiramisu.</p><p>What is the point of making your own butter or Graham crackers when you can buy them so easily? Mr. Weissman offers a few different reasons. He observes that making your own graham crackers—complete with poke holes, pricked with a fork—\"is an instant ego boost, and also an even bigger flavor boost.\" As for butter, his point is that it is \"an essential learning process\" to find out how to make \"one of the greatest foods on the planet.\" It's certainly a fun project to follow Mr. Weissman's recipe for butter by whizzing heavy whipping cream in a food processor for a few minutes before straining and rinsing in ice cold water. When you see the finished pat of golden butter, you think: \"Wow, did I really make this?\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you decide which foods to make from scratch and which to buy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The truth is that no, you didn't really make this, unless you grow all your own food as well as cooking it. Scratch cooking is never quite as scratch as it seems because to get back to the beginning of a recipe you would have to start with the soil or the seed or the sun. My supposedly scratch recipe for spaghetti carbonara would be nothing without the skill of the cheese-maker who made the Parmigiano, the curer who made the pancetta or guanciale and the chickens who laid the eggs. Behind every supposedly raw ingredient in our shops and markets there are farmers and packers and processors and delivery drivers (among others) whose labor is largely hidden from us.</p><p>Carl Sagan, the astronomer, famously said that in order to make an apple pie truly from scratch you must \"first invent the universe.\" The British food writer Ella Risbridger, author of \"Midnight Chicken (&amp; Other Recipes Worth Living For)\" argues that pre-prepared ingredients are to be celebrated precisely because they make it easier for us to cook. \"There is no shame at all,\" she writes, \"in buying pre-rolled puff pastry.\" Ms. Risbridger makes a \"Squash Skillet Pie' from pre-chopped squash, pre-rolled puff pastry and canned chickpeas. It's delicious and all the more so because it is so forgiving on the cook. Some of the best meals are neither \"buy\" nor \"make\" but half and half.</p><p>The Charm of Making Foods You Usually Buy</p>",
