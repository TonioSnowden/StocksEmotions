Factory managers in southern China reported a fall in orders in October of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acb7e15f-6243-4ba7-9d49-5ac2b1afe1f9\">as much as 50 per cent</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt is considering cutting the threshold on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3698777-99a1-4165-9d9d-be11b421c073\">top rate of income tax</a> and targeting inheritance tax as he seeks solutions to the country's £54bn black hole in next week's Autumn Statement. Plans for low-tax <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e2b4842-1295-4b9e-9704-82456f069c95\">investment zones</a> are to be scrapped. </p></li> </ul>  <p>Good evening.</p> <p>Today's announcement by Meta of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/348068b1-24d9-434b-9ae7-6599027bf84f\">11,000 job cuts</a>, the largest retrenchment in its history, is a striking example of how the global economic downturn is hurting Big Tech.</p> <p>Last month we reported that the broader technology sector had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3abf8c31-95bb-47ea-a461-351a5fbfaa4d\">lost nearly $1tn</a> in market value in the course of a week, but the most noticeable signs of slowdown are at social media companies.</p> <p>Their biggest headache is the abrupt halt to a decade-long boom in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0abf4840-2f5a-4eae-8414-1dfda77750b0\">social media advertising</a>. US advertisers are forecast to spend $65bn on the sector in 2022, a year-on-year increase of just 3.6 per cent and about 10 times slower than in 2021, according to eMarketer. <br><br>This is creating serious problems at companies such as Meta — owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — where advertising is the main source of revenue. Ecommerce has declined from its pandemic peaks, while competition for eyeballs has increased. Investors are also failing to share head honcho Mark Zuckerberg's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e457f1a-ee9f-419d-b8aa-2b54f7809705\">enthusiasm for the metaverse</a>. &#xa0;</p> <p>On top of this, Meta faces difficulties in targeting and measuring advertising because of changes in privacy policy at Apple. Apple last year began forcing app developers to get permission to track users and serve them personalised ads on their devices, a move that has also led to small businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1959b06d-0a6e-4c37-9528-476f83626a86\">cutting back marketing spending</a>.</p> <p>One of Meta's newer competitors, TikTok, is also in trouble. Although the Chinese-owned company is still growing quickly, it is struggling with the same problems as its older rivals. As we report today, it has slashed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4ce8f13-bec0-4cde-a885-7857f0bbb733\">global revenue targets</a> after making sweeping<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e70316fa-bae2-4b3a-989f-d761e078b7a0\"> leadership changes</a> in the US, its largest market. Staff have also been told that the planned Hong Kong IPO of parent company ByteDance was unlikely to take place this year. </p> <p>Job cuts are also the order of the day at Twitter as new “chief Twit” Elon Musk takes a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9a2a0ec-d3fe-422d-bc62-fa9ddfd3f06c\">scythe to the company's workforce</a> to address a “massive drop in revenue”. </p> <p>Advertisers, including big brands such as L'Oréal, General Motors and Mondelez, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17281b81-b801-4a8f-8065-76d3ffb400fa\">also got the jitters</a> over Musk's plans to relax controls of content, fearful the platform will be swamped by a wave of hate speech and misinformation. </p> <p>There was bad news, too, for YouTube, owned by Google parent Alphabet, which reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2696ea3f-86a8-4652-9301-121ed1c747d8\">disappointing ad revenues</a> — falling for the first time since the company started reporting its performance separately in 2020. Smaller social media company Snap has also ditched about a fifth of its workforce after reporting slowing growth figures.</p> <p>One final sobering thought: social media's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0abf4840-2f5a-4eae-8414-1dfda77750b0\">forecast growth rate</a> for 2022 is almost the same as traditional outlets such as TV and radio — whose audiences have been shrinking for years.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p>UK plans to review or repeal all <strong>EU-derived laws</strong> by the end of 2023 have hit a snag: ministers have discovered an additional 1<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c0593a3-19f1-45fe-aad1-2ed25e30b5f8\">,400 pieces of legislation</a>.</p> <p><strong>European Central Bank</strong> officials challenged the idea of a “dovish pivot,” arguing for the continuation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac258fea-8c7c-48b1-b00b-117cc4d8dbfc\">aggressive rate rises</a>. The ECB will also be on the lookout for signs of a <strong>wage-price spiral</strong> after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e65d339b-c44f-438e-a747-e2d20b7497ae\">new tracker</a> showed pay growth accelerating.</p> <p>New proposals from <strong>Brussels</strong> would tighten sanctions on EU members that violate the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f25005a-bc49-4dcb-8a26-957082133288\">bloc's fiscal rules</a>, as contained in the stability and growth pact.

The threat of widespread blackouts and rationing is waning but Europe should not be complacent about energy security, argues the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2316953-be18-487d-ae28-050e599d958c\">FT editorial board</a>. The boss of Spanish utility Iberdrola was also critical of Europe's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7797bd70-645d-4ef9-a7ee-0c90aa1a09c6\">response</a>, as was Czech energy minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ad30268-c063-400e-bd89-87f8b4b01598\">Jozef Síkela</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: Global economy</h1> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5198e3ba-997f-4db5-8310-3a68ae91d9f2\">faster investment is needed</a> to help poorer countries cope with <strong>climate change</strong>.
