  "text": "<p>While criminals have traditionally operated in the shadows—recruiting partners in criminal forums—the demands of Fin7's growing business appear to have pushed it to make appeals in the open, WSJ reports. (More below.)</p><p>The most recent estimates from (ISC)², a nonprofit association of certified cybersecurity professionals, pegs the global talent shortage at more than 3.1 million people.</p><p>The gap leaves some sectors short on cyber expertise. Relatively low pay in government and other sectors turns desirable cyber experts away. One legal expert told me the need for cyber professionals in food and agriculture, in particular, leaves farms and related businesses vulnerable. \"Top talent is not working those industries,\" he said.</p><p>How is the cyber talent gap affecting you? Let me know.</p><p>Record-breaking Number of DDoS attacks in 2021</p><p>Cybercriminals are discovering ever-more-ingenious ways to part organizations from their money. Explore our latest report on the constantly changing threat landscape to stay ahead of your adversaries.</p><p>Read more</p><p>On a professional-looking website, a company named Bastion Security says it sells cybersecurity services. But the site's operator is a well-known hacking group called Fin7, Recorded Future and Microsoft say.</p><p>Fin7 is believed to have hacked hundreds of businesses, stolen more than 20 million customer records and written the software used in a hack that disrupted gasoline delivery in parts of the Southeastern U.S., federal prosecutors and researchers say.</p><p>The Bastion Secure website, which uses the logo BS, has listed jobs that are technical in nature and appear similar to work that would be performed at any security company—programmers, system administrators and people who are good at finding bugs in software. Prospective hires will work nine-hour days on a predictable schedule: Monday to Friday, according to the company website. Lunch breaks are provided, the site says.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber and Privacy News</p><p>Breach investigation: Trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. is notifying 231,687 drivers that their personal information was exposed after Microsoft's Power Apps low-code tool left business data accessible on the internet for nearly 11 months starting in August 2020. Cybersecurity vendor UpGuard Inc. notified Microsoft of the problem earlier this year. J.B. Hunt on Sept. 10 finished its investigation of the incident, which affected a portal for driver employment applications. Names and Social Security numbers were compromised.</p><p>Free cyber services for nonprofits: Non-governmental organizations, think tanks and other non-profit groups can get free monitoring and notification about nation-state attacks under Microsoft's AccountGuard program. Microsoft will also assess the security risks of nonprofits and help improve their cyber training, the company said Thursday. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>Financial privacy: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking into how big tech companies use consumers' financial data. The bureau issued orders seeking information from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and others would help it \"better understand how these firms use personal payments data and manage data access to users.\" (WSJ)</p><p>All of the companies are engaged in consumer-facing financial services or have ambitions to expand in that sector. Facebook and Amazon declined to comment; Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Snap's stock sinks as it blames Apple's privacy changes for hurting its ad business. The social-media company said revenue rose 57% for the three months ended Sept. 30, slightly below analysts' expectations and its own guidance, but it expects expansion to slow. Apple's privacy policy requires apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked, which has made it harder for firms to target their ads at the right audience and get data regarding how well their ads performed.
