  "text": "<p>\n  My seventh-grade dance was a big deal. There wasn't much else to look forward to in Barrington, Ill., in the early '70s. The town, an hour northwest of Chicago, was small. There were farms and a country club that we didn't belong to. That was about it. </p><p>\n  After I received my dance invite, I immediately set to work sewing a pair of marigold corduroy elephant bells that hugged my hips and flared out wide. I flipped the corduroy pattern on one leg, and the bells wound up two-toned. </p><p>\n  Sonny &amp; Cher were big on TV then. I wanted to look like Cher. But no one at the middle-school event asked me to dance. I was crushed. I also realized that being different came with a price. </p><p>\n  The bell-bottoms were radical. Up until then, virtually everything I wore growing up had been purchased at the local Bob and Betty Shop. From my gym uniform to my first bra, all my clothes were preppy. I had no clue about the latest designer looks. I didn't read fashion magazines, and the design for my bells came from a fabric store's pattern book. </p><p>\n  My family lived in an old Victorian house that needed constant renovation. There were always chores, from handing dad tools to helping him paint the house. </p><p>\n  My father, Ed, was a science teacher. I went to his school starting in kindergarten. The first time I saw him in the hallway, I yelled, \"Dad! Dad!\" At home that night, he asked me to call him Mr. Rowley. I said, \"OK, Mr. Rowley.\" In first grade, my parents transferred me to a Catholic school. </p><p>\n  My mom, Clem -- short for Clementine -- was and is a homemaker and a painter. Her father had been a commercial artist who specialized in branding. He created the look for the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer logo. </p><p>\n  One day in art class, we were told to draw a picture of a bluebird the nuns put up. I drew an insanely beautiful bird with rainbow colors, not a bluebird. They had me redraw it several times until I was in tears. When I got home, Mom went to the school and pulled me out. She didn't want her kid drawing a bluebird like everyone else. </p><p>\n  Dad was and still is an emotional guy. When I was little, he laughed way too hard, he liked to dance in the living room by himself and he cried at Kodak film commercials. </p><p>\n  My parents let me and my younger brother, Mike, make our own decisions. Except when we wanted to do something wild. \"When you're 18, you can do what you want,\" they'd say. </p><p>\n  When I was a freshman in high school, my parents told Mike and me they were having a baby. We were, like, what? The news was so confusing and weird. David was significantly younger. </p><p>\n  In high school, I went through every phase, from supernerd to tough girl. Boredom made me creative. I'd rummage the racks at church sales, buy things like an old Girl Scout uniform, tailor the top and bottom and wear it. </p><p>\n  After high school, I studied art and painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In my junior year, I focused on fashion and designed this big puffy down jacket with silver pants. I thought it looked cool, but my teachers kept telling me to remove some down from the coat, that it was too puffy. This went on until they said I wasn't going to be in the coming runway show. </p><p>\n  The following year, we had to create a senior collection. The top prize was cash and a fellowship in Italy. My teachers hated my designs -- a collection of monastic, tobacco-color hand knits. </p><p>\n  After my collection showed on the runway, the panel of Chicago industry experts named me the winner. I took the money, put my stuff in a U-Haul and moved to New York. I combined my cash prize with $3,000 from my grandmother to get started. </p><p>\n  I was a scrappy hustler. I worked my ass off. It was do or die. It took me 10 years to figure it all out. People like Michael Coady at Women's Wear Daily thought I was a firecracker. After positive reviews, my commercial success and brand began to take off. </p><p>\n  Today, I live with my husband, art dealer Bill Powers, and our two daughters in a five-story townhouse in New York's West Village. It's colorful, eclectic and has a playfulness to it. I love our outdoor space, which means fresh air and our 30-foot swimming pool. It keeps me in shape for surfing. </p><p>\n  Mom was good at saving things, but somehow my marigold bell-bottoms disappeared. I don't care. I've always been more excited about the next thing. Good riddance to bad bells. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  As told to Marc Myers </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Cynthia Rowley, 62, is a fashion designer who recently introduced Rowley Surf, a swim and surf collection. She appears with her daughter, Kit Keenan, on their weekly \"Ageless\" podcast, hosted on the Apple and Spotify platforms. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Cynthia's Favorites </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Favorite artists? </p><p>\n  Alice Neel, Claes Oldenburg and Jasper Johns </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Vacation rule of thumb? </p><p>\n  Never go anywhere twice. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Next dream trip? </p><p>\n  Sicily </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Still have the gold-leaf baby-grand piano? </p><p>\n  The one that doesn't play and has a plastic bottom? I do. When parties resume, we'll fill it again with ice and Champagne. </p><p></p>",
