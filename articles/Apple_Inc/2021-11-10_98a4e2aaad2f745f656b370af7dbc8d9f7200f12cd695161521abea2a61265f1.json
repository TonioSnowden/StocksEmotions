  "text": "<p>ITV said the advertising performance will help profit to cash conversion of 60%, up from its previous estimate of 30%.</p><p>ITV's studios have produced shows including “Vigil” for BBC, “Physical” for Apple TV+, “Snowpiercer” for Netflix, and “Love Island,” which airs on CBS in the U.S. and ITV in the U.K.</p><p>Marks &amp; Spencer UK:MKS was also sizzling, up 16% with the U.K. retailer upgrading profit guidance for the second time since August. “Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons,” said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to the 10% rise in food sales from 2019 levels as clothing and home revenue fell 1%.</p><p>The FTSE 100 UK:UKX rose 0.6% in afternoon trade, defying the global selloff after stronger-than-forecast U.S. inflation data. A rotation into defensive plays including drugmakers AstraZeneca UK:AZN and GlaxoSmithKline UK:GSK lifted the U.K. index.</p>",
