Uniswap doesn't know how much I paid for that coin, because the purchase never happened inside Uniswap. So they cannot do the tax information without knowing the cost basis because exchanges don't talk to each other,” Chandrasekera said.</p><p>Coinbase COIN is a Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange, while Uniswap UNIUSD is a decentralized crypto exchange.</p><p>It amplifies the pain that crypto traders often buy one cryptocurrency using another cryptocurrency, which creates taxable events. “In the stock world it never happens. You don't buy Google stocks using the Apple stocks,” Chandrasekera said.</p><p>Ultimately, the responsibility lies with taxpayers to keep track of their cost basis, fair market value and USD gain or loss whenever they dispose of a crypto asset. “We all can only think about tax during tax season. But the reality is that taxable events are happening all year long,&#xa0;”&#xa0;said Ben Borodach, co-founder of tax software April.</p><p>Is crypto mining income taxable?&#xa0;</p><p>The answer is yes, according to the IRS guidelines.&#xa0;</p><p>When one mines cryptocurrencies successfully, they must report the fair market value of the mined tokens as of the date of receipt as their gross income, the IRS said.</p><p>What about NFTs?</p><p>Trading NFTs could also create taxable events. “If you think about an investor who buys an NFT, they probably had to take their dollars to buy another crypto and then use that crypto to buy the NFT. Well, they just had a potential capital gain or capital loss and they may not have realized that,” &#xa0;according to Borodach. &#xa0;</p><p>Meanwhile, when a creator sells an NFT on marketplaces such as OpenSea or LooksRare, their profits are subject to income taxes.</p><p>The IRS knows&#xa0;</p><p>“A lot of people think that crypto is completely invisible from the IRS and the regulators, because it's anonymous. That's not true,” CoinTracker's Chandrasekera said.&#xa0;</p><p>The IRS could detect crypto transactions in different ways, even when investors do not withdraw cryptocurrencies from their wallet and convert them into fiat currencies.</p><p>To start with, some crypto exchanges send Form 1099 to IRS, alerting the agency that a taxpayer has been trading cryptocurrency. Thus, the taxpayer is likely to be expected to report crypto on their tax returns.&#xa0;</p><p>Meanwhile, the IRS first added a question about virtual currencies in Form 1040 in 2019. The 2021 version of IRS Form 1040 asks, “at any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency?” MarketWatch's tax columnist Bill Bischoff wrote about how to answer that question here.&#xa0;</p><p>When it comes to criminal activities, the IRS may also use blockchain analytics tools, tying pseudonymous wallets to actual people involved in illicit activities, Chandrasekera noted.</p><p>Read more: The party's over for some AMC and GameStop investors, but luckier meme-stock winners are bracing for a massive tax bill</p><p>Crypto companies, funds</p><p>Shares of Coinbase Global Inc.
