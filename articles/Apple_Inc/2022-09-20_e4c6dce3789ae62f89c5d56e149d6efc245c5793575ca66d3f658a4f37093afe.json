The meeting starts Tuesday and ends Wednesday.</p><p>\"Volumes remain light and the mood cautious, with few looking to take on large positions before hearing what the Fed says and where policymakers see rates going by the end of the hiking cycle,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, in a note. \"This is what will drive the markets, not the rate hike tomorrow, but what the Fed plans to do next.\"</p><p>Need to Know: There's only one 'perfect asset' to fight all the bad news that could be coming, says this strategist</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury yields, which move opposite to price, continued to march higher, with the rate on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y jumping 12 basis points to trade near 3.60% after ending Monday at its highest since 2011. The yield on the 2-year note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y continued to press toward the 4% threshold.
