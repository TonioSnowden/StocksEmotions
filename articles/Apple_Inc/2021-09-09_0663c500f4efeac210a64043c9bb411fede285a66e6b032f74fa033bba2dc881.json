  "text": "<p>Hedge funds are elbowing their way into Silicon Valley at an <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/4935b205-8344-465a-8edf-dc23ec990302\">unprecedented rate</a>, with a record $153bn worth of investments in private companies in the first six months of 2021.</p> <p>A report from Goldman Sachs has found that hedge funds have done 770 deals so far this year, beating the record number set in the whole of 2020. Just under three-quarters of this year's deals were so-called “venture” bets on infant companies.</p> <p>The data highlight how hedge funds, known for investments in publicly traded assets, have been drawn to private markets in an effort to fire up largely lacklustre returns. </p> <p>The hedge funds getting into this space are some of the most high-profile names in the industry, including Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management and Altimeter Capital Management.</p> <p>The push into private investments coincides with a broader revival in the hedge fund industry, which last year reported its best returns since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009 after years of weak performance.</p> <h1>Six more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. ‘Failure is not a crime' </strong>Elizabeth Holmes's failure to make her blood-testing technology start-up Theranos a viable business was not a crime, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7462815-f022-4e11-a3fd-a7845b1191a2\">her lawyers told a federal jury</a> yesterday, at the beginning of a closely watched trial that will scrutinise her mental state and Silicon Valley's promotional culture.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Legal analysts say the trial could boil down to a notoriously tricky concept in US law, writes Miles Kruppa who is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a04df52-4734-493b-a5d7-c9a6728e9e8d\">covering the case</a> in California.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Yellen: US Treasury could run out of cash </strong>Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4433d8ef-7d18-4c07-ba08-7f05fcbdb0b8\">has warned</a> that the US Treasury risks running out of cash next month unless Congress increases its borrowing limit, as President Joe Biden's administration grows increasingly worried about a possible debt default.</p> <p><strong>3. Cathie Wood's Ark cuts China positions</strong> Cathie Wood, one of the world's most closely watched investors, said her fund had “dramatically” reduced its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ddf4b5b-3267-41b2-ad04-8f4e77783a5c\">exposure to China</a>. Meanwhile, shares in Tencent and NetEase, two of China's leading gaming companies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f724834b-53fb-4e1b-83d6-62150e3741f2\">fell heavily today</a> after authorities said approval for new games had been suspended.</p> <p><strong>4. US justice department to challenge Texas abortion law</strong> The justice department lawsuit could be filed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f8d6f6d-966b-4a3a-8f8d-c6eed703ccfb\">as early as today</a>, according to two people familiar with the matter, and follows comments from US attorney-general Merrick Garland earlier this week that his agency was “urgently”&#xa0;exploring&#xa0;“all options” to challenge the Texas abortion law.</p> <p><strong>5. Bill Gates's Cascade buys $2.2bn stake in Four Seasons</strong> Cascade, the investment firm run for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3889fdcd-b151-4540-ae29-3a0f54216c1c\">cemented control</a> of the Four Seasons luxury hotel group after buying shares from a Saudi royal, in the technology billionaire's first big deal since he split his fortune with Melinda French Gates earlier this year.</p> <p><strong>6. EY to invest $2bn on improving audit quality </strong>The accounting firm has revealed it will invest <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/737dd635-dba2-49d7-bcdd-34f467b218ea\">about $2bn</a> over the next three years to improve the quality of its audits as part of a record $10bn plan following scandals including the collapse of German payments group Wirecard.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> is considering whether to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4edfefb-4fba-46d9-bef3-2cfdba57bdb3\">mandate jabs</a> for employees and fire those who refuse to comply, according to an internal memo.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Chinese</strong> foreign minister said his country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ee1eb47-0b0b-4f91-9b12-ca3e23cd544a#post-478ec823-744f-4d31-9353-1f5fa5e00487\">would donate</a> 3m Covid-19 vaccine doses to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.</p></li>  <li><p>An Oxford start-up has secured funding to develop <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to design <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10d1ca38-be4b-444c-a227-747c716ed7d3\">antiviral pills</a> that could stop potential pandemics in their tracks.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Covax</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aba43463-464e-42dc-9712-5a93758179a3\">slashed its forecasts</a> for Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to the developing world by about 25 per cent this year.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ee1eb47-0b0b-4f91-9b12-ca3e23cd544a\"><em>our live coverage</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/newsletter-signup/coronavirus\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> to our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-business-update\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a><em> for a regular briefing on how the pandemic is affecting the global economy.</em></p> <p><em>Plus, the FT is hosting a special event on the future of American healthcare on September 14.

Part of it, writes Brooke Masters, is about money. Powerful, well-funded opponents, like Epic chief executive Tim Sweeney&#xa0;and Spotify, are helping <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6abc6cb9-1d46-4cb2-a203-ac4d305caa3e\">make the case</a> for change.</p> <p><strong>Views from on high </strong>If the impact of any business executive's words is a combination of tone, content and the height of the pulpit from which they are delivered, then Sir Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos set new standards in their space race. It is all too easy to dismiss CEO-speak as flannel or hype. It is often all that.
