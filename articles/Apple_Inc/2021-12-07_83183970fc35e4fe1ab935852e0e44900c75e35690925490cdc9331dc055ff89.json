  "title": "Samsung heir launches management shake-up",
  "text": "<p>Samsung Electronics has reshuffled its management for the first time in four years as it steps up its push into non-memory chips and artificial intelligence. </p> <p>The shake-up comes as Lee Jae-yong, the group's third-generation heir, has started playing an active management role four months after being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3857903c-ed62-4203-8c32-eba0340b2bee\">released from prison</a>.</p> <p>Lee, who spent 19 months in jail for bribing former president Park Geun-hye, still faces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bccaedf1-3833-4f31-b960-7df39a1bdc88\">charges of stock manipulation</a> linked to the 2015 merger of two Samsung units engineered to consolidate his control. </p> <p>He is expected to meet customers of Samsung's 5G telecommunications and construction businesses on a trip this week to the Middle East following a high-profile visit to the US last month.</p> <p>After Lee's trip, Samsung announced it would build a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bdb3163-59ab-4cb4-b3b5-8970a7290b85\">$17bn chip plant</a> in Texas to help Washington expand US chip production, a national security priority for Joe Biden's administration. </p> <p>Lee's shake-up outlined on Tuesday included merging Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile divisions to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee13ada3-a66a-4b3a-9def-bb308a800941\">take on competitor Apple</a>, which boasts a fully integrated line of devices. He promoted Han Jong-hee, head of Samsung's visual display business, to take charge of the new division.</p> <p>Han, an expert in television research and development, has played a critical role in maintaining Samsung's leadership in the global TV market for the past 15 years, and helped the group achieve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b7b284a-a280-4252-bcc7-0fb6a4ef5d92\">explosive sales growth</a> during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>“Lee seems to want Han's TV expertise to be used for the mobile business including foldable phones as Samsung's mobile division loses its market share,” said Kim Young-woo, an analyst at SK Securities. “They also want to create synergies by integrating devices.” </p> <p>Kyung Kye-hyun, chief executive of affiliate Samsung Electro-Mechanics, will head the chip business, which accounts for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4535db6f-632f-4afd-b919-2f5a97b1a5ef\">almost two-thirds</a> of the company's operating profit.</p> <p>Samsung is working to strengthen its non-memory chip business as the company struggles to catch up with Taiwanese rival <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\">TSMC</a> in contract chip manufacturing. Non-memory chips are used for processing data such as application processors in smartphones. </p> <p>Kyung is a memory chip design expert with experience in chip packaging. “His design and packaging expertise in chip manufacturing could help Samsung focus on making new chipsets for artificial intelligence or self-driving,” said Kim.</p> <p>Soon after Lee was paroled in August, Samsung Group announced a three-year, $206bn investment plan to expand its footprint in semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence and robotics.</p> <p>Samsung shares gained 0.66 per cent on Tuesday morning but have fallen about 15 per cent from a January peak on investor concern about possible microchip oversupply next year and a lack of a clear long-term growth strategy.</p> <p>The company is also facing growing investor pressure for more efficient capital allocation as its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c1febfb-5347-40c9-9c18-4c09addd6b60\">cash pile hit $102bn</a> in the third quarter, putting its potential capacity for megadeals on a par with SoftBank's Vision Fund, the tech investment vehicle.</p><p>Source: Song Jung-a in Seoul  2021 'Samsung heir launches management shake-up' FT.com 7 December.
