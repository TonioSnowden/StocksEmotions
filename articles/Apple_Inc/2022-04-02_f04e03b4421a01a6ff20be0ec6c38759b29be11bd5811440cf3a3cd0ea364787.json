  "title": "Will Smith Resigns From Academy After Oscars Slap of Chris Rock; Best-actor winner says, 'I betrayed the trust of the Academy,' and says he will accept further consequences for his actions at ceremony",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Smith has faced heavy public criticism after the ceremony on Sunday night, when he slapped Chris Rock in the face after the comedian made a joke about Mr. Smith's wife, actress Jada Pinkett Smith. The 53-year-old actor then shouted an expletive-laced invective at Mr. Rock, twice.</p><p>Less than an hour later, Mr. Smith accepted the best actor award for his performance in \"King Richard,\" a drama about Richard Williams, the father of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams. In a tearful speech, Mr. Smith appeared to equate the incident on stage to the protectiveness that his movie character felt toward his family. Later in the evening, Mr. Smith celebrated at an Oscars afterparty, dancing and singing to his own music and posing for pictures with his family.</p><p>In Friday's statement, he struck a much different tone.</p><p>\"The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,\" Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Though he apologized to the academy in his Oscars acceptance speech, it wasn't until the next day that he apologized to Mr. Rock in an Instagram post.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What should the academy do next in light of Will Smith's resignation? Join the conversation below.</p><p>This week, the academy held an emergency meeting to weigh what repercussions Mr. Smith ought to face for his outburst, including the possibility of suspending or revoking his academy membership. The group had announced plans to reconvene on April 18.</p><p>David Rubin, president of the academy, issued a statement Friday in response to Mr. Smith's announcement. \"We have received and accepted Mr. Will Smith's immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,\" it said. \"We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy's Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18.\"</p><p>Mr. Rock didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>By announcing his resignation before any punishment could be decided, Mr. Smith took control of the narrative. \"I have directly responded to the Academy's disciplinary hearing notice, and I will fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct,\" he said.</p><p>The actor also said he would accept any further consequences that the board decides to impose.</p><p>Mr. Smith's star power has made him one of the few Hollywood actors with direct control over his destiny, capable of greenlighting and often producing his own projects.</p><p>Among his high-profile projects in development is the Apple Inc. movie \"Emancipation,\" scheduled for late 2022 release. Early buzz among movie-industry executives had that film putting Mr. Smith back on the awards circuit around this time next year. Apple hasn't announced changes to plans for the film's release.</p><p>Mr. Smith, as an ex-member of the academy, can no longer vote for future Oscars. The academy could act to penalize him further or bar him from awards consideration. Based on how the academy has handled controversies in the past, it would be unusual for the group to revoke Mr. Smith's best actor trophy.</p><p>\"I betrayed the trust of the Academy,\" he said. \"I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film.\"</p><p>In closing his statement, he vowed to be better. \"Change takes time,\" he wrote, \"and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.\"</p><p>Erich Schwartzel contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com</p><p>Will Smith Resigns From Academy After Oscars Slap of Chris Rock</p>",
