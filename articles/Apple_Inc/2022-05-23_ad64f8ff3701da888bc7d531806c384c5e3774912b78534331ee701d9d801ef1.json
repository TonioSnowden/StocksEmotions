  "text": "<p>At first glance, new audio drama <em>Radioman</em> sails dangerously close to parody. It is about a man who loses his job as a local radio host and, after a murder takes place on his doorstep, decides to launch a true-crime podcast. It is, at its most basic, a podcast about a podcaster making a podcast.</p> <p>But this 10-parter comes with an impressive pedigree. It was inspired by an article by journalists Dimiter Kenarov and Greg Antrim Kelly about the Macedonian serial killer Vlado Taneski, and developed by <em>Game of Thrones</em> actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (who also stars) and Joe Derrick, writer of the film <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09e668a6-d485-421f-8e3a-d4c9ee687029\"><em>Against the Ice</em></a>. But the biggest draw for audiophiles will be the involvement of Benbrick, the producer and sound artist behind the boundary-pushing, Peabody Award-winning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd517058-7e37-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\"><em>Have You Heard George's Podcast?</em></a> and the equally inventive comedy series <em>Futile Attempts (At Surviving Tomorrow).</em></p> <p>Set in a fictional former mining town in the north of England, <em>Radioman</em> follows Chas Jones (Coster-Waldau) as he documents the progress of the murder investigation led by his friend and drinking buddy, DCI Ian Whittaker (David Morrissey). When another body is found, it becomes clear that a serial killer is on the loose and preying on local women, though the focus is mostly on Chas, his new venture — the podcast, titled <em>Crimesville</em>, is a runaway hit — and his family, who include his lawyer wife Connie (Cathy Tyson) and daughter India.</p> <p>We also hear from Whittaker, who would like to see the death penalty reintroduced and who was ready to retire before this case landed on his desk. “Not a single murder in the time I've been a copper here, and then bang, just as they try to push me out to grass, this comes along,” he says.</p> <p>Using dead women as a springboard for telling male stories, whether they're investigators or perpetrators, is a habit of too many true-crime series, and it's a shame <em>Radioman</em> doesn't break with this tradition. But the series is sharp on the undercurrent of racism in a depressed town where residents are quick to point the finger at local Sikhs Manny (Divian Ladwa) and Sukhinder.</p> <p>As the action moves back and forth in time, fleshing out the characters and providing context to present-day events, the tension builds up nicely. And, as expected, the sound is superb — multi-layered and immersive without being intrusive (this is a series best heard on headphones). The music, which laps artfully around the dialogue, is original and gorgeous.</p> <p>Another gripping new audio drama, <em>Listening In,</em> features <em>The Marvelous Mrs Masel</em>'s Rachel Brosnahan as Julia, a lonely New Yorker who starts hearing neighbours' conversations via her home speaker system. Julia gets drawn into their lives and what begins as idle prying turns into something considerably more dangerous.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Radioman-Podcast/B09ZVN49FQ?qid=1652348689&amp;sr=1-2&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&amp;pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&amp;pf_rd_r=DFP6Z9A7KRXDEDSF2WQS\"><em>audible.co.uk;</em></a> <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/listening-in/id1620940424\"><em>apple.com/apple-podcasts</em></a></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Radioman review — an immersive new crime drama podcast' FT.com 23 May.
