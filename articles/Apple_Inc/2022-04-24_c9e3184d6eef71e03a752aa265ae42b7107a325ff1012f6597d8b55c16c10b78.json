  "title": "Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea's Prosecutor-Turned-President, Wants a World That Follows the Rules; Leader takes office next month wanting to improve ties with U.S. and Japan, and hoping transparency works with North Korea and China",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Yoon, a prosecutor who entered politics only last year, won last month's election for Korea's main conservative party by a razor thin margin. He takes office May 10 for a five-year term at a time of significant friction between Washington, a longtime military ally, and Beijing, the country's largest trading partner. He will need to navigate the security fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contend with a North Korea that has embarked on a new round of weapons tests.</p><p>In a weekend interview at his transition office in Seoul, he signaled a pragmatic approach to foreign policy. On North Korea? He would offer significant economic incentives if Kim Jong Un takes concrete steps toward disarmament. On the U.S. and Japan: He wants to improve ties with both. On Washington-Beijing tensions? Not a zero-sum matter for Seoul. On Ukraine? No plans to offer lethal weapons.</p><p>\"As president one of my most critical responsibilities is to uphold values as contained within our constitution, which is to uphold liberal free democracy, the market economy,\" Mr. Yoon said. \"That is the core and crux of South Korea whether it's foreign policy or domestic policy.\"</p><p>Mr. Yoon has pledged to broaden South Korea's involvement in working groups of the Quad—a security partnership involving the U.S., Australia, India and Japan that seeks to counter China. Mr. Yoon said he doesn't expect South Korea to get an invitation any time soon. But if approached, South Korea \"will positively review joining.\"</p><p>In a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Biden, which could come before a planned Quad meeting in Tokyo in late May, Mr. Yoon said he would talk about strengthening the two countries' alliance. South Korea is home to America's largest overseas military base with about 28,500 military personnel. But he would also bring up his goal of improving Seoul's ties with Japan, which have frayed over trade disputes and historical issues.</p><p>Seoul, in recent years, hasn't taken as active a stance on the security risks posed by an increasingly well-armed China as have other U.S. allies in the region. \"In the U.S. strategy to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific against China expansion, the weak link is Korea,\" said Michael J. Green, a former U.S. National Security Council official who is now senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.</p><p>On Saturday, Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, stood aboard an American warship that had recently deployed to the waters between Japan and Korea—a show of military force following a string of Kim regime missile tests. Pointing to the imminent arrival of a South Korean delegation in Tokyo, he proclaimed, \"A new day, a new chapter in the trilateral relationship based on renewed friendship.\"</p><p>South Korea is the world's 10th largest economy and home to global conglomerates like Samsung, Hyundai and LG. Mr. Yoon wants to attract more investment by ensuring there is no discrimination against foreign companies. He said he seeks to eliminate unnecessary regulations that could hamper business activity or foreign investment.</p><p>\"The government's role is not to get involved and dictate how the market operates,\" Mr. Yoon said. \"My government will pursue a policy so that we can correct and normalize so that the market can operate as it should.\"</p><p>As a prosecutor, Mr. Yoon focused on corruption and misdeeds by the nation's elites, even earning the nickname \"the angel of death.\" He put behind bars a pair of presidents who were his immediate predecessors as conservative leaders. He hunted malfeasance at big business, including a corruption case involving the de facto head of Samsung. On his transition-office desk sat a single iPhone.</p><p>Only about half of the country believes he will do a good job as president, according to recent polls. His recent predecessors, conservative and progressive alike, came into office having received some benefit of the doubt with South Koreans, attracting favorability ratings of roughly 80% or more.</p><p>Mr. Yoon, for his part, hasn't made many lofty promises, and lower expectations from voters could mean he later wins over some detractors should he land some initial achievements, such as boosting employment or taming inflation, said Chung Min Lee, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Asia program. That would contrast with prior presidents who started out with higher approval ratings, then disappointed after stumbling, he added.</p><p>\"Unless he really craters, I think he'll actually build up his cachet,\" Mr. Lee said.</p><p>Mr. Yoon promises a tougher line on North Korea than the outgoing, left-leaning President Moon Jae-in, who prioritized peace talks. The Yoon administration's stance will be to call for the complete denuclearization of the Kim regime.</p><p>But Mr. Yoon said he is willing to offer incentives to Pyongyang that go beyond the humanitarian assistance pledged by the Moon administration—so long as North Korea takes a first step toward disarmament. He pointed to allowing outside inspectors to visit the North's nuclear sites as an example of a first step Pyongyang could take. In return, Seoul would help galvanize investment in North Korea and consider providing critical information on technology.</p><p>North Korea has allowed such inspections before, though not for many years. But the prospects today look low, given Pyongyang's border restrictions over pandemic fears and disinterest in diplomacy. North Korea has unleashed a string of weapons launches in recent months, including its first full-range intercontinental ballistic missile test in more than four years.</p><p>Mr. Yoon has expressed a desire to boost deterrence against North Korea, including advocating for pre-strike capabilities should a Pyongyang attack look imminent. But sharing or deploying nuclear weapons with the U.S. in South Korea aren't options under consideration, he said. He backs what he calls extended deterrence that could include more vigorous intelligence sharing or carrying out more field exercises.</p><p>Joint U.S.-South Korea military drills have been scaled back for years following a directive by then-President Donald Trump in 2018. They have become largely computer simulations, including annual springtime exercises that began April 18.</p><p>Mr. Yoon envisions a return to field exercises by the fall or next spring. He isn't sure of the size or precise timing, and any decision would require consultation with the U.S. But, he added, \"In some way, we will see a resumption of these joint field exercises.\"</p><p>Continuing tensions between the U.S. and China could be both an opportunity and a risk, Mr. Yoon said. He believes there are ways to ensure peace, co-prosperity and co-existence with the two countries. On the campaign trail, Mr. Yoon stated a desire to have mutual respect with Beijing.</p><p>\"However, if we are seen as being ambiguous or flip-flopping in our foreign policy, then it could very well become a risk,\" Mr. Yoon said.</p><p>Upon taking office, Mr. Yoon said his top domestic priorities would be to help businesses and individuals recover from the pandemic. He criticized the current Moon administration for keeping restrictions for too long. He also promised to pursue deregulation—even by working with executive orders or other maneuvers that don't require legislative signoff.</p><p>South Korea's official presidential compound, located at the foot of a mountain in northern Seoul, was long called the Blue House, named after the color of the roof tiles. But Mr. Yoon will relocate the entire compound to central Seoul where the country's Defense Ministry is located. He plans to ask fellow South Koreans to help name it.</p><p>But in the interim, Mr. Yoon has come up with his own name: the \"People's House.\"</p><p>Peter Landers in Tokyo contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Timothy W.
