  "text": "<p>If you can make it in New York City, you can make it anywhere, Frank Sinatra crooned. But over the 12 months starting in July 2020, more than 300,000 Big Apple residents decided “anywhere” was a more attractive proposition. That is the takeaway from a recent report from the US Census Bureau quantifying <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/urban-demographics\">population </a>shifts during the first year of the pandemic. </p> <p>The data confirmed what was anecdotally obvious: Americans in big, dense and expensive cities fled for seemingly greener — literally and figuratively — pastures. New York, San Francisco, Washington DC and Boston were among the top 10 cities with populations greater than 50,000 losing the highest proportion of their citizenry. Most of the rest were suburbs of that foursome.</p> <p>Big US cities became increasingly expensive during the 2010s. But their high-paying industries and cultural capital still attracted talented workers. Remote working upended that bargain, allowing residents with itchy feet to abscond. Among the big winners in pandemic migration were midsized cities in Arizona and Texas, many of which were already teeming with newcomers in 2019.</p> <p>We will find out in another year or so whether the easing of the pandemic in later 2021 and 2022 slowed or even reversed the flight from the coast. Notably, rents in New York have rocketed in recent months as some lockdown refugees returned. </p> <p>Available data suggests that the triumph of superstar cities is not destiny and may have been unhealthy to begin with.</p> <p>In a period of just over a year before the pandemic started, American cities with the biggest population declines nearly all had fewer than 200,000 inhabitants. Percentage declines tallied to 2.1 per cent or below. Rankings leader Petaluma, California would not have even made the top 10 a year later, when San Francisco led the pack with a whopping 6.3 per cent outward migration. </p> <p>The problem for big cities is that they rely on high population densities for economies of scale in everything from bus transport to opera performances. In late 2021, a fifth of Manhattan office space remained vacant, the highest level in three decades. Property assessments had fallen so sharply that the city was projecting its largest source of revenue, property tax collections, would drop in 2022, the first decrease in nearly 25 years.</p> <p>There is no natural law that dictates famous big cities have a monopoly on prosperity and cachet. A reordering may be under way. That could be healthy for the US as a whole. For cities like New York and San Francisco it would be painful.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
