  "text": "<p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>When Billy Bob Thornton read the script for the pilot episode of \"Goliath,\" about a once high-powered lawyer who has been kicked off his perch, lives in a motel and spends his off hours in a local bar, the actor says he thought: \"I understand why they called me.\"</p><p>In the three seasons since, Billy McBride, the brilliant, perpetually underdog lawyer, has won more than a billion dollars for his clients and sparred with politicians, cartels and at least one defense contractor. In the fourth and final season, which premieres Friday on Amazon Prime Video, he has relocated to San Francisco and his longtime associate, Patty, has him working with her firm on a case in the opioid crisis. Oh, and he is recovering from being shot in the third season's finale.</p><p>Mr. Thornton says he has spent more time with Billy McBride than any other character in his career. It helps, he says, that he sees more of himself in McBride—particularly his sense of justice—than any other character he has played.</p><p>\"When I would go home at the end of the night, Billy McBride was still in the car,\" Mr. Thornton, 66 years old, said recently in a Zoom interview, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt, white bandanna, crooked fedora, multiple necklaces and a white goatee. \"One thing I can say I'm proud of in my career is that I always chose the things where I knew I was the right guy and turned down things where I knew I wasn't the right guy. I think that one of the most important things an actor can do is know who you are.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Foundation'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Foundation,\" a new science-fiction series based on Isaac Asimov's trilogy of novels, is about a mathematician who predicts the fall of a galactic empire—and what happens to his colony of followers who are banished to the edge of the galaxy. It is a story that spans generations, planets, science and mathematics.</p><p>Showrunner and executive producer David S. Goyer says he was twice offered the chance to turn the story into a movie, but couldn't figure out how to condense it all into two or three hours. In retrospect, he says, \"I don't think I was mature enough to adapt it at that time, either.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Goyer is best known for his work on dark films such as the \"Blade\" and \"Dark Knight\" trilogies. Now that he is a father of three, he says he is more interested in projects with a positive message.</p><p>\"One of the themes of Asimov's original trilogy was legacy: What will remain after we're gone? What do we choose to preserve? What do we choose to forget? What do we leave for our children? What are we willing to sacrifice for our children?\" he says, adding: \"I realized with this show that I wanted to make something that I could leave behind for my children, for my personal legacy, and that I wanted it to be an optimistic message.\"</p><p>An Expert Recommends: 'Baywatch'</p><p>(Hulu, Pluto TV)</p><p>Diablo Cody won an Academy Award for writing the screenplay for 2007's \"Juno.\" At Sunday's Tony Awards (Paramount+), she is nominated for writing the book for the musical, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" inspired by Alanis Morissette's 1995 album. Here, she recommends another '90s pop-culture artifact. Edited from an interview.</p><p>\" 'Baywatch' has become my comfort food. It's like taking a time machine to the '90s and experiencing a simpler time where David Hasselhoff can solve any problem. I've also been watching a lot of old episodes of 'Dawson's Creek' (Netflix) and the original 'Beverly Hills, 90210' (Paramount+, Pluto TV).</p><p>\"I think a lot of it is teenage nostalgia, which is probably part of the reason that I did 'Jagged Little Pill.' I feel like being a teenager in the '90s was, like, the coolest era in which to come of age, maybe second only to like the late '60s. There's a reason why you see 19-year-olds out there rediscovering '90s movies, wearing Doc Martens and obsessing over Nirvana. Honestly, I'm waiting for the Smashing Pumpkins renaissance. What a band.</p><p>\"So, yes, it is possible that I'm stuck in the past and obsessed with the '90s. But the other thing about 'Baywatch' is that the era feels prosperous. It feels abundant. I feel fulfilled and satisfied by an episode of 'Baywatch.' \"</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>— With a Little Help From Old Friends: ABC's \"The Wonder Years\" reboot is yet another look at life in the 1960s—this time through the lens of a Black family. It premiered this week on ABC. Fred Savage, star of the original series, directs the pilot. Episodes of the original and the new series are available on Hulu.</p><p>— Streaming Wins: Streamers took home many of the major awards at Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards, including outstanding comedy series (\"Ted Lasso,\" Apple TV+), outstanding drama series (\"The Crown,\" Netflix) and outstanding limited or anthology series (\"The Queen's Gambit,\" Netflix).</p><p>What to Watch: 11 Shows and Movies to Stream This Week</p>",
