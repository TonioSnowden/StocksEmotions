  "text": "<p>Ms. Maboné and her 20 or so colleagues have been back at their desks for about a month, and she has noticed alcohol is \"always in the center of social things here.\"</p><p>The company is trying to resurrect office camaraderie but a number of her co-workers don't drink. \"It's funny that that's such a heavy part of trying to keep people invested so you don't lose them,\" she says.</p><p>As businesses work to settle employees into offices, some are pulling out the stops—literally, on kegs, casks and wine bottles—in an attempt to make workplaces seem cool. Sure, executives could simply order people to return to their cubicles, and some have, but many want their workers to come back and like it.</p><p>That means giving people what they want, or at least what bosses think they want. People like to wear comfy hoodies, right? OK! They miss their dogs when they go to work, don't they? The canines can come! They love an afternoon cocktail, yes? Check out our new office bar!</p><p>Sam Welch, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, recently visited the new office of a prospective client and was struck by the wide selection of libations available at all times.</p><p>\"I immediately understood the vibe,\" says Ms. Welch, 25. \"It was very 'Mad Men.'\"</p><p>It isn't that companies are encouraging people to get hammered … for the most part. WeWork's famously over-the-top corporate culture eventually backfired on founder Adam Neumann, as depicted in the aptly named \"WeCrashed\" drama series on Apple TV+. Unchecked alcohol use has contributed to more than a handful of other Silicon Valley meltdowns. No smart leader wants to deal with such a mess.</p><p>Many do, however, want the office to feel a bit more edgy and exciting than it did before the pandemic. At a minimum, it has to be more alluring than the sofas, kitchen tables and spare bedrooms where so many people have been doing their jobs for the better part of two years.</p><p>The question is whether it will work at a time when many people view flexibility as the ultimate amenity and care more about compensation than connecting with their co-workers.</p><p>San Francisco-based Interior Architects reports most—yes, most—clients are requesting bar installations in new and renovated offices these days, accelerating a trend that began before Covid-19.</p><p>Companies in a range of industries and locations are using office bars to woo prospective hires, close deals and promote internal schmoozing, says Neil Schneider, a principal at the firm.</p><p>\"Executives host these cocktail hours,\" he says. \"You may be new with an organization and you're, like, 'I'm going to go in on Tuesday because the CEO is doing his favorite beers on tap, and I want face-to-face time.'\"</p><p>Even companies that don't have fully stocked in-house bars are toasting office returns with sudsy social hours to foster bonding. And teams that used to sit shoulder to shoulder five days a week are now hybrid and trading their in-office coffee chats for \"off-sites\" with wine.</p><p>The flow of work-related alcohol follows a surge in overall consumption during the past two years. Americans have reached for adult beverages with gusto to face a deadly virus, volatile economy, manic housing market, isolation, inflation and countless other unsettling new realities.</p><p>Researchers say it is hard to pinpoint the time of day when people imbibe. But anecdotal evidence suggests the collective attitude has been \"it's 5 o'clock somewhere.\"</p><p>\"I'd say 70% of the company was drinking by the end of the day\" when fully remote at the height of the pandemic, says Mike Cavanagh, who leads a media technology business in Burbank, Calif.</p><p>Day drinking can be as much throwback as novelty. Christopher Minakowski, a 50-year-old lobbyist from Maryland, keeps decanters of Macallan Scotch in his home and corporate offices. He says they remind him of childhood visits to his father's office.</p><p>\"It was a normal thing in the '70s and even the early '80s that these guys would be having drinks at the office, which always blew me away,\" says Mr. Minakowski, adding he is far more restrained than his dad's generation.</p><p>Many workplaces cleaned up their acts in the ensuing decades, though it has long been common for tech startups and co-working spaces to keep a few brews on tap. (For some reason they always seem to be hoppy IPAs.)</p><p>The #MeToo movement underscored alcohol's potential to fuel toxic work environments. How many times have we heard about unwanted advances or touching after a couple of rounds?</p><p>Booze can blur the line between professional and personal relationships in ways that make certain workers—often less-powerful ones—feel uncomfortable.</p><p>And then there are the health consequences. Considering everything workers have been through since early 2020, \"it makes sense that we are seeing an increase in alcohol consumption at different levels and workplaces, in particular,\" says Jagpreet Chhatwal, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who has studied pandemic-era alcohol use.</p><p>His research team projects the recent uptick in drinking will lead to 8,000 additional alcohol-related deaths by 2040.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you noticed work getting boozier?</p><p>People I talked to who partake during the workday agree moderation is key and say alcohol, like free food, can draw crowds, lower inhibitions and contribute to an inviting atmosphere when handled with good taste.</p><p>James Vermillion, a financial adviser in Kentucky, sometimes enjoyed a finger or two of bourbon in the afternoon when working at home in 2020. Then, when he opened his own office as a solo practitioner in a shared workspace, he decided to bring along his state's signature spirit as a way of shedding the \"stuffiness\" of the large—and dry—firm where he worked before.</p><p>He now collects special releases from local distilleries and displays them atop a cask, inviting clients to savor something rare while planning their finances.</p><p>\"People get really excited, like, 'Oh, I've been wanting to try that bottle,'\" Mr. Vermillion says. \"It's a cool way to enjoy a moment with them.\"</p><p>Write to Callum Borchers at callum.borchers@wsj.com</p><p>Your Office Is Open and the Liquor Is Flowing</p>",
