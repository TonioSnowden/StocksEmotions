  "title": "Kansas Vote Signals Abortion Could Emerge as Top Political Issue in November; Both parties weigh surprise result rejecting constitutional amendment that would have eliminated abortion rights in the state",
  "text": "<p>Many Republican analysts saw a flashing yellow warning sign for their party from the first statewide test of abortion sentiment since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. With voters agitated by inflation and unsatisfied with President Biden's job performance, most analysts say the election environment favors GOP candidates. But the high turnout for the referendum—which drew about twice the number of votes as in the state's 2018 primaries—suggested to some that the abortion fight could energize Democrats and sway independent voters.</p><p>\"I think this will alter traditional turnout models, mostly likely in the Democrats' favor,'' said John Truscott, who served as communications chief for former GOP Gov. John Engler in Michigan, where an abortion referendum is also likely to be on the ballot this fall. In some close races, he said, renewed attention to abortion rights could tip the balance toward Democrats.</p><p>The Supreme Court's ruling said the U.S. Constitution doesn't guarantee the right to an abortion. Since then, a number of states, especially in parts of the South and Midwest, have moved to ban or heavily restrict abortion following the Supreme Court decision. Abortion opponents said the result in Kansas was a devastating defeat in their efforts to further limit it.</p><p>The amendment, which sought to decree that the Kansas constitution doesn't protect abortion, was rejected or received a mixed reception in several rural counties that had given Mr. Trump 60% and even 70% of their vote in 2020, suggesting that a substantial number of Republicans opposed the measure. Opposition also appeared to come from independent voters who turned out in large numbers: About a fifth of those voting on the referendum—more than 180,000 people—didn't vote in the day's Republican or Democratic primaries for governor.</p><p>The results were immediately being studied for their implications in statessuch as Michigan, one of the nation's most closely contested battlegrounds. A proposed constitutional amendment enshrining abortion rights is likely to be on the ballot there—if approved by elections officials—while voters are also choosing between Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who supports abortion rights, and her Republican opponent, Tudor Dixon, who doesn't.</p><p>California and Vermont will vote on similar amendments in November. In Kentucky, a state that has already enforced an abortion ban, voters will weigh an amendment stating there isn't a right to an abortion protected in the state's constitution.</p><p>Coming gubernatorial and legislative races in states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could determine the future of abortion access in those states. Abortion also could be an issue in U.S. House races in suburban districts, poised to be some of the most competitive in the country. </p><p>People went to the polls on Tuesday in Johnson County, Kan.

Still, the GOP \"may have miscalculated the intensity of the support for abortion rights, not only nationwide but in Republican areas,'' Mr. Porn said.</p><p>Others argued that it wasn't clear that abortion would weigh more heavily on voter decisions than other issues. \"I still think the biggest issue is going to be the economy,\" said Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.).</p><p>Micah Roberts, a Republican pollster, said that abortion rights \"is an issue that can certainly fire up the left…But at the end of the day, if you can't pay your bills because inflation is at a 40-year high, there's just another force within the conversation.\"</p><p>Still, Democrats believe the issue will play to their advantage in key races across the country.</p><p>\"If it's going to happen in Kansas, it's going to happen in a whole lot of states,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). \"The strong pro-choice turnout we saw last night in Kansas will continue well into the fall, and Republicans who side with these extremist MAGA policies that attack women's rights do so at their own political risk.\"</p><p>State election records show that women accounted for 70% of Kansans who registered to vote after the Supreme Court's abortion ruling, according to Tom Bonier, a Democratic voter-data analyst.</p><p>The referendum was soundly rejected in the state's suburban and metropolitan areas, losing by 16 percentage points in the Wichita area and by 36 points in the area around Kansas City suburb Overland Park.</p><p>Support for the amendment was stronger in the state's rural communities. Still, the results suggested that some Republicans opposed it. In Cowley County, on the southern border with Oklahoma, Mr. Trump drew 68% support in 2020, but voters there narrowly rejected the referendum on Tuesday, 52% to 48%. Mr. Trump had won 72% support in rural Allen County, but voters split evenly on the referendum, with 50% for and against it.</p><p>Republican legislatures around the country have been enacting laws that ban abortion throughout all or most of pregnancy, sometimes with only an exception if the patient's life is in danger. Political analysts said Tuesday's result in Kansas suggests voters may have been wary of having such far-reaching laws in their state. \"We've found that many voters who would define themselves as pro-life still embrace several exceptions,\" said Tony Fabrizio, lead pollster for Mr. Trump's two presidential campaigns. \"Conversely, many voters who would define themselves as pro-choice would embrace certain time limits.''</p><p>Abortion opponents cautioned against reading too much into Tuesday night's results, which they said were influenced by millions of dollars that poured into the campaign from large donors and wall-to-wall media coverage of the abortion issue since the Supreme Court's decision on June 24.</p><p>At least $12 million in advertising poured in to sway voters, split roughly equally between supporters and opponents.</p><p>The Kansas vote could motivate abortion-rights supporters to try to take the issue to voters directly in more states in future years, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. \"It's going to make ballot initiatives seem like a promising tool for Democrats, and especially abortion-rights supporters, who are not sure how this is going to translate into Democratic victories at the polls,\" she said.</p><p>The Kansas referendum came in response to a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling that the state's constitution protects the right of personal autonomy, including access to abortion.</p><p>Mike Kuckelman, chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, said he was surprised by the wide margins of Tuesday's defeat, which he said will limit what the GOP-led legislature can accomplish in terms of placing limits on abortion. \"Without this, it makes it very difficult for them to do much of anything,\" he said.</p><p>In recent months, Kansas clinics reported an uptick in patients from states like Oklahoma and Texas after bans on the procedure took effect there.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What will be the future for a woman's access to abortion in Kansas? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Trust Women, an organization that operates an abortion clinic in Wichita, said providing abortions for people in Kansas and throughout the region will be a priority. The clinic will soon finish construction that will allow two doctors instead of one to work at the same time, making room for more appointments each day, said Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord, a spokesman for the organization.</p><p>The outcome Tuesday \"makes us very optimistic about our opportunities going forward—including working to expand access,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com, Aaron Zitner at aaron.zitner@wsj.com and Jennifer Calfas at Jennifer.Calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Kansas Vote Signals Abortion Could Emerge as Top Political Issue in November</p>",
