  "text": "<p>While much of British business may have caught a chill from Brexit this winter, the tech start-up sector appears to be running hot, with investors eager to pour money into listings and funding rounds.</p> <p>There has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9442066-1bbe-4cb3-b668-af6a9958a324\">record investment of close to $8bn</a> already in 2021, according to Tech Nation, the government-backed entrepreneur network.&#xa0;Five companies have raced to a valuation of more than $1bn so far this year — almost as many as in 2020 as a whole.</p> <p>This fundraising activity comes after a record-breaking 2020, according to <a href=\"https://technation.io/report2021/\">Tech Nation's annual report</a> into the health of the industry, which shows the UK is third in the world in attracting tech VC funding. Tech investment reached $15bn last year in the UK, pulling away from rival European tech hubs Germany and France despite challenges from the pandemic and Brexit.</p> <p>London <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/london-is-home-to-60-unicorns-after-record-levels-of-investment-last-year/\">now has 60 companies</a> with “unicorn” status, with six more becoming worth over $1bn in 2020:&#xa0; Octopus Energy, Arrival, Kazoo, infobip, Gousto and Hopin. The additional five unicorns already created this year include challenger bank Starling and insurtech Zego <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f5d5439-c655-4f0f-a484-8aacd0333c96\">(Alphaville reports today</a> that Austria has only just experienced its first unicorn, with Vienna-based crypto broker Bitpanda funded for a $1.2bn valuation).&#xa0;</p> <p>In the US, start-ups are exploring alternatives to VC funding. Miles Kruppa has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54cb4f6f-e8ff-4029-84cc-61c8df3e15b4\">taking a look at Pipe, </a>which is adapting the practice of invoice factoring, more commonly used by manufacturers, for tech start-ups who want fast cash without the expense of raising venture capital. “I think we've unlocked the largest untapped asset class in the world,” says Harry Hurst, Pipe's chief executive.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. eToro to list through Spac, Trustly tests waters</strong><br>Online broker eToro has agreed to go public <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b82d9c8-beb4-44c7-baaa-f20005f15c4f\">at a $10.4bn valuation </a>after merging with a listed blank cheque company. The Israeli company, which has more than 20m registered users, will combine with Fintech Acquisition Corp V, the special purpose acquisition company set up by banking tycoon Betsy Cohen, in one of the largest Spac deals of 2021 so far. Swedish payments start-up <strong>Trustly</strong> is testing the waters <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b37a92b-15e6-4b9c-8427-315a8b5f4332\">for an IPO </a>that could value it at $11bn or more. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd8e60bc-e466-4f44-9ca1-2384afdfcc71\">Lex says</a> investors should question whether this niche business deserves a valuation multiple that is some 50 times sales.</p> <p><strong>2. China tests ways round Apple privacy rules</strong><br>Some of China's biggest tech companies, including ByteDance and Tencent, are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/520ccdae-202f-45f9-a516-5cbe08361c34\">testing a tool </a>to bypass Apple's forthcoming privacy rules and continue tracking iPhone users without their consent to serve them targeted mobile ads. Meanwhile, Chinese internet companies have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79c2459d-85fe-457b-bb09-26d587eeaed6\">pulled Alibaba's popular UC web browser</a> from their app stores, a day after President Xi Jinping warned that Beijing's crackdown on big tech companies was just beginning.</p> <p><strong>3. Huawei patent record, Nokia job cuts</strong><br>Telecoms equipment provider Huawei says it recorded <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/614c6149-2f6e-482f-b64a-97aa2496ac7f\">its biggest ever annual jump</a> in the number of patents it owns last year as the company ramped up its research and development effort to answer Beijing's call for homegrown innovation. By the end of 2020, the company held more than 100,000 active patents, up from just over 85,000 active patents at the end of 2019. Its Finnish rival Nokia said on Tuesday it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dd1860d-fb15-4ab4-91a8-19e2d2a851dd\">cut up to 10,000</a> jobs to try to regain its competitiveness after losing out in the early rounds of 5G networks to Huawei and Ericsson.</p> <p><strong>4. Foxconn may make electric cars in Wisconsin</strong><br>Taiwan's Foxconn is considering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2920cf0b-9a7c-40ed-a2cc-50b8d13d3bb2\">making electric vehicles</a> in its plant in the US state of Wisconsin as soon as 2023, as the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer seeks to reduce its dependence on Apple. Its chairman said on Tuesday it would decide by July between Wisconsin and Mexico for car production.</p> <p><strong>5. News Corp's Facebook deal, old media's streaming success</strong><br>The Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher has struck a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-3743eba8-dc91-47f8-add1-f2f9626f75dc/xMtMvKIlcZHp5RU-LjJeoQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiMyjWP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMzc0M2ViYTgtZGM5MS00N2Y4LWFkZDEtZjJmOTYyNmY3NWRjP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjA1MGExNDAwZjA1MTkwMDA0MzVlYzQwJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0xM2I3ZTM0MS1lZDAyLTJiNTMtZThjMC1kOWNiNTliZThiM2JXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpgSAKkUGD7xlpTUhRjaHJpcy5udXR0YWxsQGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\">three-year deal</a>&#xa0;to provide news to Facebook in Australia, ending a battle between two billionaire-owned empires being watched worldwide as a possible template for regulating Big Tech. Our media team has been looking at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e284319-de87-43ed-a4bd-a8acb97f283a\">spectacular rally</a>, sparked by streaming over the past year, of ViacomCBS and Discovery.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Google's 2nd-gen Nest Hub</h2> <p>Google unveiled its second-generation Nest Hub today, with an improved speaker with 50 per cent more bass, and a range of colours — Chalk, Charcoal, Sand and the new Mist. But its most interesting feature is Sleep Sensing, which uses&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ai.googleblog.com/2021/03/contactless-sleep-sensing-in-nest-hub.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615859099066000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MppB8qClOvlAjlQQli4fJ\">Motion Sense (powered by Soli low-energy radar technology)</a>&#xa0;to analyse how the person closest to the display is sleeping. Placed on a bedside table, it can detect movement and breathing, providing analysis without the need for a camera or wearable. <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-nest-hub-soli/\">Google says: </a>“Every morning you'll receive a personalised sleep summary on your display, or you can view your sleep data anytime on the Nest Hub by asking, ‘Hey Google, how did I sleep?'” It can also connect to the Google Fit app so users can see the sleep summary alongside other health and wellness information. The new Nest Hub costs $99.99 and can be pre-ordered in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Australia from today.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Tech funding races to record' FT.com 16 March.
