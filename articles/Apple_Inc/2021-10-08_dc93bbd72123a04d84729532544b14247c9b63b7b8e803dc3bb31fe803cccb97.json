  "text": "<p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> is doubling down on Canada. The postal group has agreed to buy ground-freight carrier Rosenau Transport for a price equivalent to about £210m. </p> <p>Rosenau will be folded into Royal Mail's GLS parcels business, with the deal funded through existing cash and borrowing facilities. </p> <p>Royal Mail first gained a foothold in Canada with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rico+back+royal+mail+dicom&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB801GB801&amp;oq=rico+back+royal+mail+dicom&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.8346j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">2018 purchase</a> of package delivery group Dicom as part of an international expansion drive under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/564c3985-e2db-451c-ac35-2f0f37360f59\">former chief executive</a> Rico Back.</p> <p>“The combination of the two businesses will create a network stretching across Canada which will enable GLS to cover the vast majority of the Canadian population and deliver further growth and synergies,” Royal Mail said. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Electrocomponents</strong> said first-half trading to September topped expectations. The widget maker posted a 22 per cent improvement in like-for-like sales over pre-pandemic levels, but cautioned that labour costs and freight charges were showing no signs of abating. With the full year likely to be more weighted than normal towards the first half, revenue and underlying profitability will be slightly ahead of previous guidance, it said.</p> <p>Mail-order retailer <strong>N Brown</strong> said it would focus on profitable growth rather than promotions after reporting a 17 per cent improvement in operating earnings for the half year ended August. The group, whose storefronts include JD Williams, Home Essentials and Jacamo, said sales remained flat but that an improvement in financial services margins had more than offset a normalisation of costs.</p> <p>Ten-pin bowling alley operator <strong>Hollywood Bowl </strong>said trading had been “exceptional” through the school summer holidays, with total revenue hitting a record in August. Like-for-like revenue was up 29 per cent since alleys reopened in May, well ahead of the board's expectations, it reported.</p> <p>High levels of UK inflation could&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-ce4936a4-4b04-45e5-b151-132651b289fa/fUhVgvFBMT_ZcC1TpUAv1Q~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjQlVcP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvY2U0OTM2YTQtNGIwNC00NWU1LWIxNTEtMTMyNjUxYjI4OWZhP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjE1ZmM2NTE4M2NhNTEwMDA0ZGRhZGUwJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphX33QX2FE0YhhUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">persist</a>&#xa0;for longer than expected, the <strong>Bank of England</strong>'s new chief economist Huw Pill said, suggesting he agrees with the more hawkish elements of the Monetary Policy Committee.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Games Workshop</strong> said that Sally Matthews, chair of its audit and risk committee, was resigning after less a year in the role. Matthews, who is chief product officer at recipe box group Gousto, was appointed a Games Workshop non-executive director last November and took up the committee chair in January. The retailer said it had begun a recruitment process for a new non-executive director.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The majority of the world's countries are nearing a milestone on a historic deal led by the <strong>OECD</strong> that will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78f\">make international companies pay an extra $100bn in corporate taxes</a> and shift more of their tax bills to countries where they actually conduct their business. In a sign that holdout countries are coming on board, Estonia said late on Thursday that it had resolved its concerns that the deal would undermine its entrepreneurs, joining Ireland in signing up to the emerging accord.</p> <p><strong>Dublin</strong> has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-2a2f69aa-f61a-4f4e-934f-293665019229/U28bMU4PPcUUNKglfFIa7A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjQlVcP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMmEyZjY5YWEtZjYxYS00ZjRlLTkzNGYtMjkzNjY1MDE5MjI5P2VtYWlsSWQ9NjE1ZmM2NTE4M2NhNTEwMDA0ZGRhZGUwJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphX33QX2FE0YhhUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">finally abandoned</a>&#xa0;its 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate and agreed to a minimum 15 per cent rate that will cost the country about €2bn in lost revenues. The move will have impact on 1,556 companies in Ireland employing 500,000 people, among them US tech giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p> <p><strong>Tesla</strong> is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272b678a-ff4d-4ecf-90a0-4eee9d32f844\">Austin, Texas</a>, making good on a threat chief executive Elon Musk made during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic last year when he decried shelter-in-place orders as “fascist”.</p> <p><strong>China</strong> has ordered coal miners to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4290d41-d45d-49c1-b779-59f01f29d4e8\">boost production urgently</a> as the energy crisis threatens factories across the world's second-biggest economy and forces Xi Jinping's administration to backtrack on climate change promises.</p> <p>Dozens of <strong>tech companies</strong>, including the most popular social media, games and dating apps, are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bed30c91-03b2-4508-b708-8073b5ec8462\">systematically endangering children online</a> and breaching the UK's new Children's Code, according to research conducted by children's digital rights charity 5Rights.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Brexit negotiation that largely ignored the City and financial services has given way to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff281890-8251-428f-b832-fabcba5a554e\">an unhappy stalemate</a> in the world of derivatives clearing. <strong>Helen Thomas</strong> runs through the risks and rewards ahead of next June's expiry of temporary regulatory equivalence.</p> <p><em>Yesterday's City Bulletin headline may have implied that airlines were refusing to offer refunds where they cancelled flights.
