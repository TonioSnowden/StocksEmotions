  "title": "Credit Markets:  Treasury  Yields Hit  Highest in  14 Months  ----  By Sam Goldfarb",
  "text": "<p>   Selling in U.S. government bonds accelerated Thursday, sending yields soaring again as uncertainty over the pace of economic expansion continued to unsettle financial markets. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which rises when bond prices fall, jumped above 1.7% for the first time since the pandemic in early trading Thursday. The declines spread to technology shares and other high-growth stocks including Amazon.com and Apple, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite losing 1.5% and 3%, respectively. Higher rates hit high-growth stocks in part by increasing the value of current cash flows relative to future ones. </p><p>   The latest yield surge in the 10-year yield, which settled at 1.730% -- its highest level since January 2020 -- extended a monthslong climb spurred by expectations for a vaccine- and government-stimulus-fueled economic recovery. Investors think that could lead to significantly higher inflation and eventually force the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates. </p><p>   Other factors are dragging down bond prices too. Those include a leap in the supply of Treasurys as the government funds trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief spending and uncertainty over whether the Fed will extend temporary regulatory relief for big banks that could directly affect how much they hold in Treasurys in the future. </p><p>   Intensifying the pressure on the bond market Thursday: a report that the Bank of Japan could let the 10-year Japanese government bond yield trade in a wider range, some analysts said. Strong jobs data in Australia further added to the bond market's weakness during overnight trading. </p><p>   \"There will be a point in which this optimism exhausts itself [but I'm] not really sure that is today,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. </p><p>   Investors and analysts pay close attention to U.S. Treasury yields because they help determine borrowing costs across the economy. Rising yields have already hit individuals and businesses, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage recently topping 3% for the first time since July. </p><p>   Some have wondered if the Fed might try to keep yields in check by increasing the amount of longer-term Treasurys that it buys each month. </p><p>   Fed officials, though, have repeatedly suggested that they see no reason to take that step yet, because demand for riskier assets such as stocks and corporate bonds has meant businesses still have access to cheap financing. Though much higher than last year, when it spent months between 0.6% and 0.9%, the 10-year yield also remains low on a historical basis, having exceeded 3% as recently as 2018. </p><p>   Yields have climbed much faster than many anticipated, leaving investors scrambling to figure out what their ceiling could be. </p><p></p>",
