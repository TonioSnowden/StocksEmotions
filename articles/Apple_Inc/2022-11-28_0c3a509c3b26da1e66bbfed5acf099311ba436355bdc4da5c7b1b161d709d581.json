  "title": "Hong Kong to Seek Beijing's Intervention After Top Court Rules in Favor of Jimmy Lai; Chief executive John Lee cites national security after government loses bid to block Apple Daily publisher being represented by a British lawyer at collusion trial",
  "text": "<p>Within three hours of the ruling, Mr. Lee said he would submit a report to Beijing requesting the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking body, to offer their interpretation and clarification on the national security law on the admission of foreign lawyers. Such an interpretation would have more weight than the top court's ruling, and the rare move of calling for an intervention is likely to heighten concerns about the city's judicial independence.</p><p>The court's decision was a rare legal setback for the city's authorities, which have been conducting a crackdown on political opponents since the law was imposed by China in June 2020, following mass and sometimes violent antigovernment protests in the city the year before.</p><p>Mr. Lai, the 74-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was scheduled to stand trial Thursday on charges that he conspired to collude with foreign countries by lobbying the international community and foreign governments to impose sanctions on China. Mr. Lai was a key figure in the protests against China's tightening of its authority over the city, which Beijing had earlier promised would be allowed to keep its colonial-era rights and freedoms until 2047. The trial is now likely to be delayed.</p><p>Hong Kong has a long-held common law tradition of allowing British lawyers to be admitted to the city's justice system to act either for defendants or the government. Its top court has several overseas judges who can be invited to join panels presiding over appeal cases.</p><p>Write to Selina Cheng at selina.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>Hong Kong to Seek Beijing's Intervention After Top Court Rules in Favor of Jimmy Lai</p>",
