Chief Executive Fidji Simo said at the time that the company was offering a special cash bonus to reward staff, and that Instacart is finding additional ways for employees to get value.</p><p>Employees received the terms of their bonuses late last week and are expected to receive 40% of the payment on Dec. 9 with the remainder paid in June 2023, some of the people said. Staff will still receive the bonus if the company goes public before the payout dates, they said.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Jony Ive on life after Apple.</p><p>Who is China's new No. 2?
