  "title": "Retail  Spending  Is Steady  As Online  Picks Up  ---  Declining gasoline  prices spur a shift in  consumer buying to  everyday items  ----  By Harriet Torry and Austen Hufford",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. consumers continued opening their wallets last month, shifting savings from falling gasoline prices to purchases of everyday goods as they weathered high inflation and a slowing economy. </p><p>   Overall retail sales -- a measure of spending at stores, online and in restaurants -- were flat in July compared with the prior month's revised 0.8% increase, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. But a measure of spending that strips out gasoline and auto sales rose 0.7% last month from June, showing shoppers maintained the ability to spend with much of the spending moving online. </p><p>   \"We've had nine weeks of gas prices falling, the evidence from this is that people saw the drop in gas prices and said 'This is good news, let's go shopping,'\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added that consumer spending appears to have got off to a \"pretty strong start\" in the third quarter. </p><p>    Federal Reserve minutes released separately on Wednesday from last month's policy meeting said officials agreed they needed to keep raising interest rates enough to slow the economy and likely would need to hold rates at that level until it was clear inflation was decelerating. </p><p>   U.S. stocks closed lower after receiving a temporary lift from the Fed minutes and U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly. </p><p>   Fed officials voted to raise their benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point in July, after an increase of the same size in June. Those were the largest rate increases since 1994. Several officials indicated since the meeting that they would support lifting rates by at least a half percentage point at their meeting in September. </p><p>   Officials signaled sensitivity last month to two different risks -- that they might not raise rates enough to bring down inflation and that they might raise borrowing costs more than needed, causing unwarranted economic weakness, according to the minutes. </p><p>   The U.S. economy contracted for two consecutive quarters and recent economic figures offer a mixed picture of its performance at the start of the third quarter. The labor market added 528,000 jobs in July and recovered all the jobs it lost at the start of the pandemic. </p><p>   Industrial production rose 0.6% in July as manufacturing output picked up after two straight months of contraction, the Fed said Tuesday. But the housing market slowed in recent months, with declines in sales, new construction and builder sentiment. </p><p>   The Fed is aggressively raising rates to bring down inflation and address imbalances in the economy created by pandemic-related factors such as supply-chain disruptions and shifts in consumer and labor demand. </p><p>   Shoppers have maintained spending despite the highest annual U.S. inflation in four decades, though they are getting less for their money because of higher prices. The retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation. </p><p>   Spending at gasoline stations, which makes up about one-tenth of retail outlays, fell 1.8% on the month. Vehicle sales, which make up about a fifth of retail outlays, declined 1.6% as inventory shortages lingered. </p><p>   Consumer purchases of electronics, a category closely tied to back-to-school spending, rose last month, as did furniture, personal care and home-improvement store sales. Spending at nonstore retailers, or online shopping, jumped 2.7% from the prior month. </p><p>   Gasoline prices fell steadily in July to below $4 a gallon of unleaded gasoline last week after peaking at more than $5 a gallon in mid-June. The run-up in gasoline prices started in the spring after Russia invaded Ukraine, a development that shocked world energy markets and took up a bigger share of consumer spending. </p><p>   \"They are getting less goods for what they were spending a year ago,\" said Phillip Braun, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management. </p><p>   Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Day event fell on July 12-13, and the company said customers purchased more than 300 million items during the promotion. Some of the bestselling items were premium beauty products, Apple Watches, diapers and kitchen items, according to the retailer. </p><p>   Companies, meanwhile, said consumers are continuing to spend, although they remain mindful about rising prices. </p><p>   Walmart Inc. reported Tuesday that higher prices led shoppers to hold back on some purchases, giving priority to lower-margin food items. Best Buy Co. said last week it is cutting jobs to lower costs, due in part to consumers shifting spending as a result of high levels of inflation. </p><p>   Target Corp. said on Wednesday that its profit last quarter declined further than the retailer anticipated as it worked to unload excess inventory. The company cited a swift reversal of buying behavior, with shoppers cutting spending on discretionary items as inflation pressured their spending and product shipments arrived late. </p><p>   \"They still have spending power, but they're increasingly feeling the impact of inflation,\" Target executive Christina Hennington told analysts. \"While the recent reduction in prices at the gas pump have been encouraging, guest confidence in their personal finances continues to wane.\" </p><p>   \"We're seeing a shift to lower cost options\" like private-label goods at grocery stores, said Jonathan Silver, chief executive of Affinity Solutions, a firm that aggregates consumer credit- and debit-card spending. </p><p>   He noted that spending at discount stores was up 17% year-over-year in July while department store sales were down 2.4%, according to Affinity data. </p><p>   Rod Poole, a retiree in Hickory, N.C., who works part time as a business and logistics consultant, said high inflation prompted his family to cut back on country-club dining to three times a month from four. They also are buying more bulk- and store-branded products such as nuts, coffee creamer and pasta. And they plan to travel in the fall rather than summer to avoid peak season prices. </p><p>   \"Being mindful about expenses is more at the forefront,\" Mr. Poole said. \"Some travel expenses are just absurd right now.\" </p><p>   Peter Stieglmayr, a mental-health counselor in Queens, N.Y., has started regularly making meatless meals for health reasons and because beef prices have increased. </p><p>   \"Even the cheap cuts are $7, $8,\" Mr. Stieglmayr said, referring to beef prices. </p><p>   Retail sales make up a relatively small slice of overall consumer spending, and the report is largely centered on goods spending. </p><p>   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release a more complete look at consumer spending at the end of the month that includes services. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Nick Timiraos contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
