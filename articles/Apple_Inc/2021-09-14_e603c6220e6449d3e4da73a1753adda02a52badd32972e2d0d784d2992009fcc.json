  "title": "Business News: Live Nation to Buy Mexican Concert Promoter",
  "text": "<p>The deal is expected to close by late 2021 or early 2022, the company said. It is subject to regulatory approval. The agreement is a sign the companies are sure that business is getting back on track.</p><p>\"We're confident,\" said Live Nation finance chief Joe Berchtold. \"The timing wasn't right when Covid hit to close it.\"</p><p>Live Nation plans to acquire Spanish-speaking multimedia giant Grupo Televisa's 40% stake in OCESA, plus an additional 11% of the company from another Latin American live-entertainment company, CIE, which will hold the remaining 49%, the company said.</p><p>Live Nation is expected to hold back 7% of the closing price to cover any potential operating losses for several quarters. The deal price is 8.84 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to $444 million at Friday's close.</p><p>Touring -- the primary source of revenue for most musicians -- has become an increasingly global business. With the rise of music streaming on services such as Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which give users the ability to discover and listen to vast catalogs of music, acts are developing more fans across the world. Markets in Latin America, in particular, have helped drive the streaming boom. The purchase will help Live Nation bring its artists' shows to their expanding audiences.</p><p>Mr. Berchtold said Latin America is Live Nation's largest untapped market, as its presence there has lagged behind Europe and Asia.</p><p>While OCESA has long served as the company's touring, festival and ticketing partner in Mexico, Live Nation now has a direct economic incentive to build its tours in a way to include the market, he said.</p><p>Mr. Berchtold said he expects domestic touring in Mexico to pick up this year, before seeing festivals in the region in the first half of 2022 and more international tours later in the year.</p><p>OCESA promotes more than 3,100 events for nearly six million fans in a typical year in Mexico and Colombia and has businesses including ticketing, sponsorship, food and beverage, merchandise, and venue operation. It owns or operates 13 venues across Mexico, including Foro Sol and Auditorio Nacional, the top stadium and theater, respectively, in the world by tickets sold in 2019, according to industry trade publication Pollstar.</p>",
