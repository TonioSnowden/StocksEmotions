  "text": "<p>CATL didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mrs. Pelosi's trip to the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, and China's anger over her visit, are likely to exacerbate U.S.-China tensions as bilateral business ties are at a low. The U.S. in recent years has imposed bruising sanctions against Chinese technology companies, while in China, nationalism has been growing among its consumers.</p><p>CATL for years has held ambitions to manufacture electric-car batteries in the U.S., the people said. It has been weighing plans to invest up to several billion dollars in a new electric-car battery plant in North America, they said.</p><p>The battery maker has been considering locations including Kentucky and South Carolina, where car makers such as Ford Motor Co. and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG operate factories, the people said. But because of the rising tensions between the U.S. and China in the past few years, as well as shortages of experienced and relatively cheap labor, it hadn't chosen those sites, they said.</p><p>Earlier this year, CATL started weighing options in Mexico. Currently, the most likely candidates are Ciudad Juarez, a Mexican town bordering Texas -- Tesla has a plant in Texas -- and Saltillo, an automotive hub in northern Mexico, the people said. Another possibility for CATL is to build some smaller assembly and storage facilities in the U.S. alongside a battery manufacturing plant in Mexico, the people said.</p><p>The company is unlikely to announce the plant before late September, though the schedule could change, said one of the people. Ford said last month that CATL would provide batteries for its plug-in hybrid vehicles in North America.</p><p>Bloomberg earlier reported CATL's decision to hold off on the plant announcement.</p><p>During Mrs. Pelosi's 19-hour stay in Taipei, her business-related exchanges focused on chips and a Taiwanese semiconductor maker that is constructing a plant in Arizona, in reflection of the U.S.'s recent efforts to secure its own high-end technology and cut off China from developing similarly advanced chips.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mrs. Pelosi met with executives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker. They discussed implementation of the recent $280 billion bill passed by U.S. lawmakers that aims to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and competitiveness with China, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mrs. Pelosi had lunch with executives of TSMC and another local manufacturer Pegatron Corp., a major supplier to Apple Inc., and discussed economic issues and supply chain cooperation, according to a social media post by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.</p><p>A TSMC representative declined to comment on the meeting. A Pegatron spokeswoman said its vice chairman spoke about technology's role amid the pandemic.</p><p>The U.S. bill offers incentives for chip makers to build facilities in America, while requiring them not to invest in more production of advanced chips in China.</p><p>Mrs. Pelosi's meeting with TSMC executives highlights the precarious dependence the world has on the island's cutting-edge semiconductor industry.</p><p>President Tsai reinforced Taiwan's business ties with the U.S. at a meeting with Mrs. Pelosi on Wednesday, saying: \"We will make Taiwan a key stabilizing force for regional security, ensuring a free and open Into-Pacific as well as the stable development of global trade and supply chain.\"</p>",
