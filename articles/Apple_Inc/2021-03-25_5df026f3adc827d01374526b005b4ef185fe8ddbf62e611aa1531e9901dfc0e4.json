  "title": "5G (A Special Report)  ---  A 5G Early Adopter Sings the Praises of The New Technology:  David Thompson sees its benefits as a pilot and music lover  ----  By Jared Council",
  "text": "<p>   David Thompson, chief technology officer at American Express Global Business Travel, is no stranger to embracing new technologies in his personal life. The licensed aircraft pilot is a bitcoin miner, a high-fidelity music streamer and, most recently, an active 5G user. </p><p>   Mr. Thompson bought an iPhone 12 Pro and a Verizon Communications Inc. mobile hot-spot device last fall, both of which use 5G service from Verizon. He says the main benefit he gets from using 5G, at least for now, is being able to quickly download the software updates and flight plans needed for navigating his seven-passenger Cirrus Vision SF50 jet, which has to be done every few weeks. </p><p>   \"Prior to the 5G it was about a 20- to 30-minute process, and now I'm doing these updates within less than five minutes,\" says Mr. Thompson, 55. \"It's a pretty significant percentage savings of time.\" </p><p>   Fifth-generation wireless networks will enable consumers to reach peak speeds up to 100 times faster than those of 4G networks, according to wireless-industry trade association CTIA, with potential peak speeds of 20 gigabits per second. The average 4G download speed in 2019 was 41 megabits per second, CTIA said in a report last summer. (There are 1,000 megabits in a gigabit.) And you don't need to own your own jet to appreciate the faster speed: It can take almost six minutes to download a full movie over 4G, CTIA said, and about 15 seconds for that same movie over 5G. </p><p>   Mr. Thompson says he's able to get 5G speeds exceeding 600 megabits per second on his phone and hot spot. And 5G coverage has been good in the places he's been flying to: Colorado, where he has a cabin, and Los Angeles, where he has family. </p><p>   Before getting his 5G devices he'd have to spend a half-hour downloading the navigation-software updates for his plane at home, place them on a flash drive and then upload them into his aircraft at the hangar. With his 5G hot spot, he can now handle the process at the hangar in mere minutes, without having to worry about misplacing storage devices. </p><p>   \"It saves a step. It allows me to be more nimble,\" he says. </p><p>   He says he's also able to more quickly download movies that his family and friends watch during flights. </p><p>   Mr. Thompson has also found 5G useful outside of flying. Since about 2016, he says, he's been a big consumer of hi-fi music -- or high-fidelity audio tracks with CD-level sound quality or better -- which he accesses through hi-fi music streaming services Tidal and Deezer. </p><p>   \"The file sizes on those are much larger\" than the audio files available on more-common music-streaming services, he notes, which can make hi-fi music more difficult to stream without interruptions. In the past, he'd have to download hi-fi tracks to his phone to avoid interruptions, but he no longer has that issue with 5G, which can stream the bigger files flawlessly. </p><p>   Music streaming has gone mainstream over the past several years, but industry executives have said audio quality has suffered. Companies including Amazon.com Inc., which launched a high-resolution music streaming service in late 2019, and Spotify Technology SA, which plans to do so later this year, are betting that hi-fi music will be the next big thing. </p><p>   \"This uncompressed CD-quality music is how artists intended for their music to be enjoyed, and 5G opens this capability up\" to more widespread use, Mr. Thompson says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Council is a Wall Street Journal reporter based in New York.
