  "text": "<p>“It's about a simplicity of design – Japanese and Nordic – two sides of&#xa0;the world coming together,” says&#xa0;Barry Hirst, the Liverpudlian co-founder of Pantechnicon, the five-storey food, drink, culture and design emporium in Belgravia that opened last September. According to Hirst, Pantechnicon is a celebration of a “shared aesthetic: not over-adorned – minimal, modest and utilitarian”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hirst is a man with vision. He first became known for reviving Belgravia's Elizabeth Street, which he turned into a&#xa0;honeypot destination with the <a href=\"https://www.thethomascubitt.co.uk/\">Thomas Cubitt</a> pub (subsequently sold, but still a&#xa0;local mainstay). When the Grosvenor Estate offered him the&#xa0;chance to develop a&#xa0;concept space on nearby Motcomb Street, he took on a&#xa0;magnificent stucco building that was once a&#xa0;Victorian warehouse – its removal vans inspired the name.</p> <p>Pantechnicon has been stripped back to the original brick and timber with a nod to wabi-sabi, and is home to two restaurants: the modern Nordic-slanted <a href=\"https://www.pantechnicon.com/eldr\">Eldr</a> and the Japanese-market-inspired <a href=\"https://www.pantechnicon.com/sachi\">Sachi</a>, as well as&#xa0;the Kitsuné pastry café, a&#xa0;Japanese bar and bottle shop, a roof garden&#xa0;and two concept stores, <a href=\"https://www.pantechnicon.com/the-studio\">The Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pantechnicon.com/the-edit\">The Edit</a>.</p> <p>Both shops have been curated by Japanese-design authority Shu Terase, who&#xa0;finessed his buying talent at Monocle and Japanese lifestyle retailer Beams, before&#xa0;spending two years scouting for treasures for these new&#xa0;stores. The Edit, on&#xa0;the ground floor, has the feel&#xa0;of a gift shop. “We want to offer something you can't get&#xa0;anywhere else in the UK,” says Terase. “Some things you may be able to get online,&#xa0;but not in a physical shop. Certain styles or&#xa0;colours are exclusive to us” –&#xa0;such&#xa0;as the “red camo” Raincho raincoat from <a href=\"https://norwegianrain.com/\">Norwegian Rain</a> (£610).</p> <p>The store is designed to be “democratic”, with prices starting from £3.50 for Japanese cypress bath salts. And diverse. Japanese wooden children's toys and chic stationery sit alongside cult outdoor brand <a href=\"https://www.snowpeak.com/\">Snow Peak</a>'s camping coffeeware and Finnish textile designer <a href=\"https://www.johannagullichsen.com/\">Johanna Gullichsen</a>'s tetrahedral bags (£84). Hirst's favourite item, discovered in Tokyo, is a small acoustic iPhone speaker – “hand-crafted, just a piece of wood, no electronics” – that costs £55.</p> <p>Upstairs, The Studio is a spacious loft for homeware, beauty brands, fashion and big-ticket items, including a bicycle from <a href=\"https://tokyobike.us/\">Tokyo Bike</a> (£550) and a super-high‑tech digital speaker from <a href=\"https://lyric-speaker.com/en/\">Cotodama</a> that doubles as a karaoke machine (£4,320).&#xa0;Make-up and skincare has been collaboratively curated with Japanese beauty specialists <a href=\"https://bijo.paris/en\">Bijo</a> (the rose-quartz stones for facial massage, £25, sell out almost as soon as they are restocked), while homeware highlights include dishwasher-safe pastel porcelainware from <a href=\"https://1616arita.jp/en/\">1616 Arita</a> with scalloped edges (plates from £12), and a&#xa0;bath mat (£125) by <a href=\"https://soil-isurugi.jp/product\">Soil</a> that is made with Japanese diatomaceous earth so that water disappears like footprints by a swimming pool on a sunny day. Terase's favourite pieces are retro-classic <a href=\"https://www.matsuda.com/\">Matsuda</a> sunglasses – each pair involves 250 stages and takes up&#xa0;to four years to make (£455-£955).&#xa0;</p> <p>Customers are united in their curiosity, says Hirst. “Not only do they want to be inspired, they are hungry for knowledge about the products.” But they remain eclectic: visitors to London, hipsters, Belgravia stalwarts, and design seekers and makers. The Japanese ambassador loved it,&#xa0;he says. Dogs, meanwhile, are welcome, but their head height has to be “below the underside of the table – so, despite the Nordic connection, sadly no Great Danes…”&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pantechnicon.com/\"><em>pantechnicon.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_pantechnicon/?hl=en\"><em>@_pantechnicon</em></a></p><p>Source: Rachelle Gryn Brettler.
