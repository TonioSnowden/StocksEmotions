  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Central Bank Chief Puts Brave Face on Struggling Economy  ----  By Paul Hannon and Georgi Kantchev",
  "text": "<p>   Russian consumers are stocking up on basic necessities such as flour and sugar, pushing up prices as sanctions raise anxiety about possible shortages, the country's central bank head said on Friday. </p><p>   The central bank painted a grim picture of the Russian economy, saying inflation will remain elevated and Russia will likely experience a recession. The bank has more than doubled interest rates and instituted capital controls to stabilize the ruble, which has fallen by more than a fifth since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   The central-bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina expressed optimism in a brief speech after a regularly scheduled meeting, saying interest rates will come down and inflation will ease as the economy adjusts to the Western sanctions. </p><p>   Some companies, she said, will benefit from the situation. \"Previously it was unprofitable to produce certain goods inside the country whereas now this is becoming more interesting for businesses,\" she said. </p><p>   Hours before Ms. Nabiullina's speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin nominated her for a third term as head of the central bank. Her reappointment solidified her position as one of Mr. Putin's allies and gives her a leading role in managing the country's economy while fighting rages in Ukraine. Her current term is due to end in June. </p><p>   \"The president has repeatedly praised the results of the work of Nabiullina and the central bank as a whole. And we see how logical it was to introduce her candidacy for another term,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday. </p><p>   Ms. Nabiullina announced new plans to bolster the struggling economy. She said the central bank will purchase Russian government bonds when trading resumes on Monday. She said the Moscow Exchange, which has been closed since the start of the war, will reopen gradually. </p><p>   She also said the bank and the Russian government would lend up to 500 billion rubles, equivalent to about $4.9 billion, to small and midsize businesses. The government has announced plans to help workers who lose their jobs and other measures. </p><p>   Inflation surged since the invasion, and prices are up 5.62% since the start of the year, exceeding the 4% target set by the central bank for the entire year. Ms. Nabiullina said one cause was demand by consumers for things like household appliances, cars and electronics amid fears that supplies would fall and prices would rise. Another was because of consumers buying staples like cereals, flour, pasta and sugar. </p><p>   Russians across the country have reported challenges in getting things like sugar, whose price has jumped 15%  this month. Authorities have suspended some agricultural exports in a bid to stabilize prices. </p><p>   Prices for staples are up sharply, including the so-called borscht set -- the vegetables needed for Russia's beloved soup -- which is a bellwether indicator for many Russians. Since the start of the year, the price of cabbage has risen by more than 30%, carrots are up by around 20% and potatoes are up by 5%. </p><p>   Increasing consumer prices are a sensitive topic for Mr. Putin, as falling living standards in the past decade have often become a catalyst for mass protests. </p><p>   In an effort to tamp down that demand, Ms. Nabiullina said most of these products are produced domestically and aren't in short supply. \"As the soaring demand decreases, price dynamics in this segment will return to normal,\" she said. \"Moreover, prices for some products might even lower.\" </p><p>   While the impact of sanctions will take weeks and months to reverberate through the economy, it has already led to factory closures. More than 400 Western companies, including McDonald's Corp., Apple Inc. and Boeing Co., have said they are pausing or ending operations there, according to a tally by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at the Yale School of Management. </p><p>   As a result, Russia's economic outlook has deteriorated sharply, reflecting the isolation of its economic and financial system, with some analysts predicting gross domestic product will fall by 10% or more this year. </p><p>   \"The current shock to the Russian economy is deeply recessionary,\" Sofya Donets, an economist for Russia at Renaissance Capital investment bank, wrote to clients this week. </p><p>   Mr. Putin on Wednesday acknowledged that the economy had suffered a hit. \"Our economy will need deep structural changes in these new realities, and I won't hide this -- they won't be easy,\" he said. He pledged to increase payments to pensioners and state employees, an increase in the minimum wage and financial assistance to businesses. </p><p>   Western sanctions have affected 84% of small businesses, compared with 26% before Russia's invasion, according to a survey by Mr. Putin's business ombudsman, Boris Titov. </p><p>   Ms. Nabiullina has run the central bank since 2013. She cleaned up several failed banks, gained a reputation for keeping a lid on inflation and built up the $640 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that have so far proved to be of limited use in cushioning the blow from Western sanctions. Russia was able to pay foreign bondholders on its sovereign debt this week, a sign that some of those reserves remain accessible for certain payments. </p><p></p>",
