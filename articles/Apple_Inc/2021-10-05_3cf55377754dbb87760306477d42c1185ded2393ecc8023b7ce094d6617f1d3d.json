  "title": "Julianna Margulies on Dating Reese Witherspoon on 'The Morning Show'; The celebrated TV actor discusses joining Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston on the new season of the Apple TV+ dramaâ€”and making peace with how 'The Good Wife' affected her family life.",
  "text": "<p>Margulies, 55, made a name for herself on the '90s medical hit ER as the lovable Carol Hathaway. Starting in the aughts, she starred in the successful legal drama The Good Wife as troubled lawyer Alicia Florrick. After spending eight months in her home in upstate New York quarantining with her husband, Keith Lieberthal, and their 13-year-old son, she found The Morning Show guest role to be a welcome reprieve. \"I remember my first day on set,\" she says. \"I was like, Right, I don't just cook and clean and do laundry and shop. I'm an actress.\"</p><p>On the series, she acts as a steely foil to chaotic morning news anchors Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) and Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). Witherspoon, who is also an executive producer on the show alongside Aniston, says that Margulies crafted a character that's comparable to ABC's Diane Sawyer or CNN's Christiane Amanpour.</p><p>\"In fact, her character is probably best friends with both of them,\" Witherspoon says. \"I imagine they play poker every Wednesday night.\"</p><p>In one of the show's many twists this season, Margulies's character and Witherspoon's character strike up a romance, which includes a backseat makeout scene. She describes with glee how Witherspoon added a beat of hesitation before their kiss to make sure viewers knew the romance between the anchors, who work at the same network, was consensual.</p><p>It's not the first time Margulies has played a queer character. She says understanding Peterson's sexuality begins from proximity to many lifelong queer friends, some of whom get significant mention in her 2021 memoir, Sunshine Girl: An Unexpected Life. (She also says, \"I went to Sarah Lawrence College. I think if there isn't a better place to learn about what being gay is, I don't know.\")</p><p>Her character, viewers learn, was fired from morning TV after being outed early in her career. Now she sits at the top of her industry as a respected prime-time interviewer. Margulies says she took inspiration for her character from the way she saw Ellen DeGeneres rebuild her career after coming out on national TV in 1997.</p><p>Margulies and Witherspoon had known each other socially when Margulies struck up a conversation at a conference to congratulate her on the success of Big Little Lies. When Witherspoon, at the time known mainly for her film projects, expressed her excitement on the juiciness of her TV role, Margulies says she replied, \"Welcome to my world. I've been wondering when the rest of you were going to get an inkling that this is where women's roles are the best.\"</p><p>Since that time, Witherspoon, has become a media mogul, selling her company, Hello Sunshine, to a media firm backed by private-equity titans Blackstone Group Inc. in a deal that valued the company at a reported $900 million in early August of this year. Margulies says that despite Witherspoon's encouragement, she has no interest in following a similar entrepreneurial path and says it's not in her wheelhouse of skills.</p><p>These days, the actress, who chronicled her frustrating and itinerant childhood in Sunshine Girl, is home more and happier about it. When she started shooting The Good Wife in 2009, her son was around a year old. She winces while recalling that her son's first words were \"Mama tired\" and \"Mama work.\"</p><p>\"I still have PTSD from that time where I couldn't be present with my family,\" she says.</p><p>Margulies, after decades working in network TV, enjoyed the luxury of shooting a 10-episode season for the streaming platform. She flew back and forth to Los Angeles every two weeks during filming to be with her family and only had to quarantine once from an on-set Covid scare. She says the pace of the show gave her sufficient time to really study her lines versus committing them to memory in bed after daily 14-hour shoots on The Good Wife.</p><p>Still, Margulies says she isn't looking to join a new version of ER on any of the reboot-happy streaming platforms. She was thrilled to participate in a pandemic Zoom reunion that included her co-star George Clooney to benefit the Waterkeeper Alliance, a clean water charity. But she draws the line at a full-scale reboot for the celebrated show.</p><p>\"What kind of possible reunion can you have with people 30 years older than they were when they first started out?!\" she says. \"I guess it's only going to be embarrassing as far as I'm concerned.\"</p><p>Julianna Margulies on Dating Reese Witherspoon on 'The Morning Show'</p>",
