  "text": "<p>An Amazon spokeswoman said the company is \"glad that our team at LDJ5 were able to have their voices heard. We look forward to continuing to work directly together as we strive to make every day better for our employees.\"</p><p>A lawyer who has represented Amazon Labor Union, the fledgling group behind the effort to unionize Amazon facilities in New York and elsewhere, said the union was weighing whether to file objections against Amazon related to the vote, and that organizing efforts would continue at LDJ5 and elsewhere. Organizers at Amazon Labor Union had said they viewed the LDJ5 election as an important next step in their push to unionize other company warehouse locations.</p><p>Labor researchers have said if enough facilities unionize, it could push Amazon to alter policies related to pay, benefits and working conditions. Amazon is contesting the first Staten Island vote and has said unions could slow down its ability to be nimble and efficiently make changes that benefit workers.</p><p>Unionizing more locations will be a challenge, labor experts say. In April, for example, a union group not associated with Amazon Labor Union won the right to hold an election at an Amazon facility in New Jersey before abruptly withdrawing its petition.</p><p>Some workers at LDJ5 said they didn't support the union because they were satisfied with their pay and benefits. Esther Jackson, a 50-year-old LDJ5 worker, said Amazon's benefits, which include 401(k) and healthcare options, have been the best she has ever had. Ms. Jackson said she is grateful for Amazon, which hired her last year despite a criminal background.</p><p>\"Amazon is my livelihood right now because of my background,\" she said.</p><p>Other employees said the union may be overpromising what it can do for workers. Kimlee Torres, a 49-year-old employee, said while the union push may have been a \"wake up call\" for Amazon, the job is reasonable for the pay and benefits workers receive.</p><p>\"We don't need it at this facility,\" she said of the union.</p><p>Amazon has more than 1,000 warehouse locations in the U.S. So far, votes have been held in the past year in three locations -- the two in Staten Island facilities and another one in Bessemer, Ala.</p><p>While overall union membership has been on a decline in the U.S., Amazon activists have continued to seek opportunities for expansion such as at Starbucks Corp., where organizers have unionized at various locations throughout the country.</p><p>Yet unlike at Starbucks, the Amazon warehouses can employ thousands of people. The Amazon facilities also tend to have relatively high turnover, both factors that affect worker organizing efforts, according to labor experts.</p><p>Workers at other major companies are mobilizing to seek changes in their workplaces. Apple Inc. employees in April started their own push to unionize, with some organizers saying they were inspired by the success at Amazon, Starbucks, Verizon Communications Inc. and outdoor retail chain Recreational Equipment Inc. and others. The efforts have come as Apple and other major corporate forces saw profits surge during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation in the U.S. has risen to historic levels.</p>",
