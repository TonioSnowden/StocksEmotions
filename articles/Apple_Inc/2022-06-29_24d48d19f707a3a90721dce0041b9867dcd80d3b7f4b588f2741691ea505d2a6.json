  "text": "<p>You could say that's a bit of an exaggeration, yet on June 29, 2007, the original iPhone went on sale, igniting the smartphone revolution.</p><p>Sure, smartphones such as the BlackBerry Curve and the Samsung BlackJack existed, but they were saddled with plastic keyboards and were meant—at least primarily—for boring old emails. Apple's touch-enabled piece of glass and metal was different.</p><p>In fact, it's probably hard for you to remember the days when your \"phone\"—if we should even call them that—wasn't able to immediately summon a car, snap a professional-looking portrait or bring up a pack of your closest friends on a video call?</p><p>Yet Noah Schmick—born in Madison, Wis., the very same day as that first iPhone—literally can't remember a time before phones did most of those things.</p><p>That's the premise of my new documentary, \"The iPhone Baby: How 15 Years Shaped a Generation.\" Over the past 15 years, the iPhone grew and developed. So did Noah…and his dependence on smartphones. Through interviews with current and former Apple executives, I traced the biggest moments in the iPhone's development and how they all impacted Noah's generation.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How did the introduction of the iPhone change your life? Join the conversation below.</p><p>By the time Noah was three, the App Store had launched and Noah was playing games on his father's iPhone 3G. A few years later, Apple was determined to make its device a full-fledged camera and Noah was asking his mom to record videos of him to post on YouTube. By age 11, he had a big-screen iPhone 6S Plus to play games on and message friends. Now at age 15, he has an iPhone 13 with a battery that can last the school day and then some.</p><p>\"Truly, we just thought this was gonna be a fun, easy-to-use thing when you want to do a few messages,\" Tony Fadell, a former senior Apple executive who worked on the original iPhone, told me in the video. \"We didn't think it was going to become the center of your life.\"</p><p>What I hope is captured is a story about world-changing technological innovation and the impact it has had on us, our families and the world.
