  "title": "Oscars 2022: Will Smith Wins Best Actor After Striking Chris Rock, 'CODA' Takes Best Picture for Apple; A confrontation between Will Smith and Chris Rock shocked viewers during a ceremony that brought big wins for Apple and Netflix",
  "text": "<p>Midway through the evening, Mr. Rock, before presenting an award, joked that Mr. Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, ought to do a \"G.I. Jane\" sequel. It was a reference to her short hair—Demi Moore played the role in the original with a shaved head. Ms. Pinkett Smith has said she has alopecia, a hair-loss condition, and has worked to raise awareness about the autoimmune disorder.</p><p>Ms. Pinkett Smith made an unamused face. Mr. Smith walked onto the stage and struck the comedian. \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth,\" he yelled, once he'd returned to his seat. A visibly shaken Mr. Rock said, \"Wow, dude, it was a 'G.I. Jane' joke.\" Mr. Smith repeated himself. \"I'm going to, OK?\" Mr. Rock said.</p><p>Not long after that, Mr. Smith won the Oscar for best actor, for his portrayal of Richard Williams, father of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams, in the biopic \"King Richard.\"</p><p>\"Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family,\" Mr. Smith said at the start of a long extemporaneous speech. \"I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things.\" The camera pivoted to Ms. Pinkett Smith, who nodded appreciatively.</p><p>Through tears, Mr. Smith said that Denzel Washington had just told him, \"At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you.\"</p><p>He apologized to the Academy and his fellow nominees, and before leaving the stage, he added, \"I'm hoping the Academy invites me back.\"</p><p>The best picture award has been coveted by streaming services like Netflix, which has tried to win for years, only to be bested by Apple TV+. The \"CODA\" win is the latest evidence of a shift that has redistributed power from Hollywood studios and theaters to tech companies and streaming platforms.</p><p>\"CODA\" won in all three categories it competed in, including supporting actor (Troy Kotsur), and adapted screenplay (Siân Heder).</p><p>Yet the exchange between Messrs. Smith and Rock dominated the evening. At least one of the online live feeds froze on that moment while others went silent, leaving TV audiences wondering what was said.</p><p>Later, comedian Amy Schumer, one of the evening's three hosts who at one point dangled from the ceiling in a \"Spider-Man\" suit, attempted to defuse the tension. \"I've been getting out of that 'Spider-Man' costume—did I miss anything?\" she said. \"There's like a different vibe in here.\"</p><p>The ceremony couldn't shake the moment. When announcing the winner for best actress, Anthony Hopkins said, \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"</p><p>From the start of the evening, the show had attempted to put on a happy face, despite falling during a period of turmoil around the world, from the war in Ukraine to the global pandemic.</p><p>Much of the night unspooled as predicted by Oscar handicappers, from Ariana DeBose winning best supporting actress for her turn as Anita in \"West Side Story\" to the science-fiction epic \"Dune\" cleaning up more technical awards like cinematography, sound and visual effects.</p><p>Best actress, one of the tossup categories of the night, went to Jessica Chastain for her performance in \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\" Ms. Chastain used her speech to speak out on behalf of the LGBTQ community.</p><p>Walt Disney Co., whose Searchlight Pictures made the film, has been under heavy fire recently from fans, employees and politicians, for its mishandling of a Florida education bill that critics called \"Don't Say Gay,\" and said targeted LGBT people. Ms. Chastain spoke in her acceptance speech against legislation she described as hateful toward that group.</p><p>In another top category, and a rare moment of triumph for the Netflix drama \"The Power of the Dog,\" Jane Campion won the directing award for the revisionist western.</p><p>Ms. Campion is the first woman to compete in the category twice, having been first nominated for 1993's \"The Piano.\" She lost in that category to Steven Spielberg for \"Schindler's List.\" This time the roles were reversed, with Mr. Spielberg passed over for his \"West Side Story\" remake.</p><p>And as predicted in the days leading up to the ceremony, \"CODA\" collected Oscar gold.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which of your favorites won an award at the Oscars? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"CODA\" actor Troy Kotsur's win for best supporting actor brought one of the most emotional moments of the night. The audience erupted in applause and then quieted as people began waving their hands, the sign-language version of clapping. With \"CODA,\" a term for child of deaf adults, Mr. Kotsur is the first deaf male actor ever to be nominated and to win an Oscar. In his signed acceptance speech, Mr. Kotsur dedicated his win to the deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community: \"This is our moment,\" he said.</p><p>\"CODA\" writer Siân Heder took home the win for adapted screenplay.</p><p>Siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell won the Oscar for best song with \"No Time To Die\" from the James Bond movie of the same name. It was one of the starriest categories, with fellow nominees including Beyoncé, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Van Morrison.</p><p>References to the war in Ukraine were brief, including a moment of silence to address the crisis and suffering in that country. \"Recent global events have left many of us feeling gutted, yet when you witness the strength and dignity of those facing such devastation it's impossible to not be moved by their resilience,\" said Mila Kunis, who is Ukrainian-American.</p><p>Ms. Kunis quickly turned to announcing a nominee for best song, with Reba McEntire singing the motivational ballad \"Somehow You Do\" from the addiction drama \"Four Good Days.\"</p><p>Celebrities went full-on with glam and bold colors—red was the color of not just the carpet but many of the couture gowns on it—and dove back into the pomp of a big celebrity lovefest.</p><p>After being cooped up in a pandemic—or a train station, per last year's Oscars, set in an airy mass transit hub in Los Angeles—celebrities went big on expressing their excitement to finally be together in one room, even if it took thousands of Covid tests to get there. (The Academy said cast and crew were administered 14,000 PCR tests ahead of the ceremony.)</p><p>And the show opened with a host for the first time in three years—in this case, a trio of hosts, with Ms. Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall opening the telecast by poking fun at the fact that most people aren't going to the movies.</p><p>\"Here we are at the Oscars,\" Ms. Hall said.</p><p>\"Where movie lovers unite and watch TV,\" Ms. Sykes retorted.</p><p>The show worked to incorporate films like \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" the biggest box office hit of 2021 that was nominated for only one Oscar (for visual effects, which it lost to \"Dune\").</p><p>Kenneth Branagh, in his eighth nomination and first win, took home the award for original screenplay. The movie, which writer-director Mr. Branagh based on his childhood growing up amid the violence and divisions in Northern Ireland, was nominated in seven different Oscar categories, an unusual achievement for any film.</p><p>John Jurgensen and Robbie Whelan contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com</p><p>Oscars 2022: Will Smith Wins Best Actor After Striking Chris Rock, 'CODA' Takes Best Picture for Apple</p>",
