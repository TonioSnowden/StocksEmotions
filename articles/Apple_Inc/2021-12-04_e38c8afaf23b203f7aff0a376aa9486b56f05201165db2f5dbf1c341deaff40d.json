The fighters incorporate advanced radar, targeting and weapons systems. </p><p>\n  Emirati forces have operated in recent years in combat against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, and in Libya, along with France, in support of warlord Khalifa Haftar against the internationally recognized government. </p><p>\n  -- Brett Forrest </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CANADA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Jobless Rate Falls </p><p>\n  Sharply to 6% </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Canada continued its stellar job-creation run in November with another blowout performance that included a sharp drop in the unemployment rate to near pre-pandemic levels. </p><p>\n  Nearly all of the job gains were in the private sector. Hours worked also rose and, for the first time, returned to pre-pandemic levels. Economists suggest the data could set the stage for a Bank of Canada rate rise in the first half of 2022. Statistics Canada reported Friday that Canada's economy added a net 153,700 jobs in November, following a gain of 31,200 in the previous month.  The unemployment rate in November dropped to 6.0% from the previous month's 6.7% reading. </p><p>\n  -- Paul Vieira </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  STATE DEPARTMENT </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Phones Hacked at </p><p>\n  Embassy in Uganda </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Apple Inc. last week notified 11 U.S. State Department employees in Uganda that their iPhones were hacked, and investigators have linked the attack to a tool developed by NSO Group, an Israeli technology company that was blacklisted by the Biden administration, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>\n  Some of the targeted employees were foreign service officers who are U.S. citizens, while others appear to be locals, the person familiar with the matter said.
