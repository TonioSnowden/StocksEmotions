  "text": "<p>Stylish and sporty</p><p>Upscale yet highly functional interior</p><p>All-wheel drive standard on all trims</p><p>Excellent warranty</p><p>Pricing starts at $41,00 (plus $1,045 destination charge)</p><p>As a new member of the Genesis family, the 2022 Genesis GV70 is the latest to enter the growing compact luxury SUV arena. The Genesis GV70 takes the crown this year as Best Compact Luxury SUV in the 2022 KBB Best Buy Awards.</p><p>It's no small feat when you consider the competition such as last year's winner, the Audi Q5, or other players like the Lexus NX, BMW X3 XE:BMW, and Mercedes-Benz GLB. The 2022 Genesis GV70 won by checking all the right boxes. It has handsome styling and sporty attitude, an ample amount of standard equipment, and remarkable technology and safety features, all at a competitive price.</p><p>Presence and style</p><p>Although it's a compact luxury SUV, the 2022 Genesis GV70 exudes a commanding presence. It appears larger and more tenacious in person. Its grille, while large, is not so big as to distract from the symmetry created by the twin light bars. The front fascia helps break up and balance what would be a very big grille opening, which seems to be the current trend.</p><p>The theme of balance continues in the profile of the Genesis GV70 with twin light bars also appearing in the rear. This creates a connectedness by giving it a beginning and an end. The beltline, although high, gives the luxury SUV a muscular look. The sweeping brightwork adds definition while also enhancing the GV70's stance.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:Behold, the most overvalued housing markets in America</p><p>A choice of two powertrains</p><p>Like its big brother the GV80, the 2022 Genesis GV70 is offered with two turbocharged engine choices. The base engine is a 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 that makes 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. More powerful and a bit more fun to drive is the 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 which puts out 375 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque.</p><p>GenesisA smooth 8-speed automatic transmission manages power for either engine. Full-time all-wheel drive is standard on all GV70 models and directs power to the wheel (or wheels) needing the assist. And because the GV70 is built on the same platform as the G70 sports sedan, this compact SUV shines on curvy roads.</p><p>Check out: The 2022 Land Rover Range Rover: The original opulent off-roader ups its game</p><p>An elegant interior</p><p>The Genesis GV70's interior is elegant, gorgeous, and sumptuous. With clean, elliptical shapes as the main theme inside, the cabin feels futuristic yet highly functional. From the 14.5-inch-wide touchscreen that sits at the top of the dash, to the knurled climate control knobs, to the stunning 3-D gauge cluster, to the luxurious leather used throughout, the GV70 exudes a truly upscale feel.</p><p>See:Which electric SUVs have the most cargo space? Here's a full list</p><p>Safety and technology</p><p>As it has done with its other vehicles, Genesis made sure to include an abundance of safety features in the GV70. Some of those features include eight air bags, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance, forward-collision avoidance assist, blind-spot collision avoidance assist, lane-keeping assist, and driver attention warning.</p><p>A cool feature that you have probably seen in a Hyundai Sonata commercial and offered on the GV70 is Remote Smart Parking Assist. While standing outside of the vehicle and using the key fob, you can maneuver the GV70 into or out of tight parking spots.</p><p>Price</p><p>The 2022 Genesis GV70 has a starting price of $41,000, with a destination fee of $1,045. The base model 2.5T AWD Standard includes a navigation system, 12-way power driver seat, heated front seats, Android Auto/Apple AAPL CarPlay, full LED lighting, and 18-inch alloy wheels. Although it is the most basic of the GV70 models, most buyers will find it more than suitable.</p><p>The top-of-the-line GV70 3.5T AWD Sport Prestige starts at $62,500. It comes equipped with a host of options including a 12.3-inch 3-D digital gauge cluster, head-up display, heated second-row seats, 21-inch alloy wheels, an electronic limited-slip differential.</p><p>Read next:The 2022 Genesis G80 and the BMW 5 Seriesâ€”two luxury sedans compared</p><p>Genesis packs a lot of value into the GV70. It's a stylish and sporty SUV that's loaded with technology and safety features, plus it has an excellent warranty. It's no wonder it has claimed the title of the KBB Best Buy Compact Luxury SUV of 2022.</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
