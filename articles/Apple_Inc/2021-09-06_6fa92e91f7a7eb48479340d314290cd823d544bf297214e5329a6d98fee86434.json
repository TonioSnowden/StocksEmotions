  "title": "Reclaiming Our Independence From Big Tech; Companies that censor political speech, harm competition and ruin our brains need regulation.",
  "text": "<p>Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee has proposed a smart bill that would make major social media platforms common carriers, requiring them to provide reasonable nondiscriminatory access to all users. Airlines can't ban you from flying because you voted for Mr. Trump, and phone carriers can't cut you off for opposing abortion. Social media platforms shouldn't be able to exclude you either.</p><p>Censorship has become an issue in the first place because tech companies are simply too big. By market capitalization, America's five most valuable companies are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google's parent company Alphabet, and Facebook. All of them are worth more than $1 trillion. Amazon controls more than half of all online retail sales in America. Google has 92% of search. Apple's annual profit is larger than the gross domestic product of seven U.S. states.</p><p>These companies got big by innovating long ago, and they stay big by making sure no other company challenges them. Talented college students today don't dream of being the next Mark Zuckerberg; they dream of Mark Zuckerberg buying their company and adding it to his empire.</p><p>We shouldn't be wary of Big Tech only because it turns huge profits or because it can crush upstart rivals. We always should be skeptical of massive, unaccountable concentrations of power.</p><p>When Google changes its core search algorithms, the Federal Communications Commission should make sure the change isn't nefarious. When Google makes deals to increase its market share, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission should scrutinize and intervene if necessary. And where our antitrust laws are insufficient, we need to write new ones.</p><p>But there is an even more important problem that Congress must confront: Big tech is hurting us. Almost everything we do online today is designed to be addictive. The average American spent more than two hours a day on social media in 2020. It isn't because scrolling through status updates and memes is the pinnacle of human existence, it is because engineers and psychologists have dedicated their careers to getting people hooked. Carefully designed algorithms bombard the pleasure centers of our brains, making us incapable of going five minutes without checking our phones.</p><p>The only winners are the tech companies. All this screen time, and every interaction with their software, creates a lot of data. These companies take this data and sell precisely targeted ads so effective they verge on predatory. They then optimize their platforms to keep you online to receive ever more ads.</p><p>It is time to reclaim our independence. A first step is to ban targeted advertising. Let Google and Twitter sell ads the way a newspaper sells ads. Restore the world where you can speak to a spouse or a parent or a friend without your phone listening in.</p><p>The next step is to go after the engineered addictiveness of tech platforms. It is a crime when opioid manufacturers aggressively push a deliberately addictive product. When casinos do it, we recognize it as a vice that needs regulation. We should take the same attitude toward apps and mobile games that are draining away the energy of millions.</p><p>Never before have a few huge corporations controlled almost the entire flow of information in our society. America's future will be determined by how Congress chooses to regulate Big Tech in the coming decade. We must resist the domination of a corporate technocracy and chart a new course.</p><p>Mr. Masters is president of the Thiel Foundation and chief operating officer of Thiel Capital. He is co-author of \"Zero to One\" and a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Arizona.</p><p>Reclaiming Our Independence From Big Tech</p>",
