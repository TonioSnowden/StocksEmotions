  "text": "<p>Amid the scramble for the exits following Vladimir Putin's announcement of “partial mobilisation” this week, I was struck by the breadth of Russian desertion. Among other land and aerial bottlenecks, there were traffic jams at the borders with Finland and Mongolia, which are almost 5,000km apart. You could line up four Ukraines in that vast geographic expanse. One rationale that Putin has not yet used for his “special military operation” in Ukraine is that Russians need more living space, or <em>lebensraum, </em>as Hitler called it. That would be too outlandish even by his standards. </p> <p>Putin's claims thus remain mystical and existential. Plus, of course, he wants to “de-Nazify” Ukraine. It seems his population is sceptical. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThomasVLinge/status/1572927376341999618\">Here's a clip of a recruiter failing to convince doubters in Dagestan</a>. “We fight for the future,” says the recruiter. “Future?” one of the young men shouts. “We don't even have a present.” It is probably safe to say that if Russia were indeed under existential threat, as both Putin and his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, claimed on Wednesday, the Russian population would be easier to corral. This suggests their propaganda is falling flat. </p> <p>Whichever way you spin it — and Putin can still count on support from the tankie left and the Eurasianist right with a few stubborn “realists” in between — Russia is losing this war. The fact that Putin had to insist on Wednesday that he was not bluffing, was a significant tell. As any gambler knows, only a player with a very weak hand will insist he isn't bluffing (unless he's double bluffing, but we're past that point with Putin).</p> <p>Apart from the nuclear gamesmanship, Putin only took one action. He promised to send 300,000 new troops into the field. This is not nearly as daunting for Ukraine as it sounds. For a start, many Russians are trying to evade the national press gang via air and land. Second, it will take months to train them, let alone produce the weapons and logistical support they would need. Third, there is no reason to suppose they would be any better trained than the existing army that has been decimated. Indeed, there is ample reason to think their morale will be even lower. The fact that the Wagner Group — the mercenary outfit run by Putin's friend Yevgeny Prigozhin — is now recruiting from prisons is both terrifying and reassuring. The more hopeless Russia's military position, the nastier this war will get. &#xa0;</p> <p>Either way Putin is losing his grip. His latest address to the nation with its accompanying nuclear threats was meant to scare the west into scaling back its support for Ukraine. It instantly produced the opposite effect. As I've told Swampians before, we consistently overestimate Putin's cunning, and he routinely underestimates western resolve. Here is a litany of his miscalculations. First, he assumed Ukraine would fold. Then he assumed the west could be frightened into backing off. In both cases he was badly wrong. Then he played his European energy card early in the summer instead of waiting until around now. That gave Europe the warning time to find alternative energy supplies and stockpile for the winter. Now he is returning to his original scare tactic and hoping that somehow this time it will yield a different result. In the meantime, he is testing the patience of partners such as China, and helpful neutrals such as India, both of which are calling for an end to fighting. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has even suggested that Russia should return Crimea to Ukraine. At the United Nations, Putin can rely only on the support of Belarus, North Korea, Cuba, Eritrea, Syria and Nicaragua. With friends like this, who needs enemies?</p> <p>I don't wish to underplay the tragedies that have yet to happen in Ukraine and the wanton loss of life on both sides. The last thing the west should do is feel triumphalist. The point is that Russia is governed by an increasingly desperate strongman, who is running out of time and options. The west should maintain its resolve, continue to defer to the judgment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and refrain from crossing any military red lines. Toppling Putin and punishing the Russian people should never be the west's stated goal. Putin is losing this war through his own recklessness. We should not give him any excuse to threaten Armageddon. </p> <p>Rana, I know you're in Italy, which is about to elevate Giorgia Meloni, a far-right post-fascist, to its prime ministership. She has ill-concealed sympathies for Putin. Am I overestimating the degree of western unity and resolve? </p> <h1>Recommended reading </h1> <ul>  <li><p>My column this week looks at how relations between Mohammed bin Salman's Saudi Arabia and Biden's America are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c697c6c9-5bc5-493a-bab1-99df3b7405b0\">drifting on to the rocks again</a>. “The Saudi crown prince's ties to Trump's family are as intimate as his disdain for Biden is obvious,” I write. “Saudi Arabia is thus now part of a select group of countries — Russia, Hungary etc — that roots for one of America's parties over the other.”</p></li>  <li><p>The Brookings Institution's Constanze Stelzenmüller has a characteristically pointed and thoughtful FT op-ed about Germany's hesitation to supply heavy arms to Ukraine. Here's her translation of the US embassy's statement on Germany's to-ing and fro-ing. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa1102b0-9511-4230-814a-725b7bcd5881\">“Love you, Berlin, but please, please, grow a pair and stop pretending we're telling you what to do.”</a></p></li>  <li><p>Likewise, my colleague <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9be9db6-a91e-48e4-8d69-4bbfff7e0f5f\">Martin Wolf takes no prisoners on Trussonomics</a>. Now that Queen Elizabeth's mourning period is out of the way, Britain faces the stark reality of a rapidly deteriorating economy. Liz Truss says she wants to unchain Britannia. The UK is set to have the slowest growth among G7 nations next year, the second highest rate of inequality and stagnant productivity. Truss's remedy is a caricature of Thatcherism. “The idea that further tax cuts and deregulation will transform this performance is fantasy,” Martin writes. &#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Finally, do read Clyde Prestowitz's Substack essay on how companies like Apple may be incorporated in the US but are <a href=\"https://clydeprestowitz.substack.com/p/americans-held-hostage\">beholden to China</a>. I don't always agree with Clyde (I suspect you are more aligned with his views, Rana), but his case is hard to dispute. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Rana Foroohar responds </h1> <p>Ed, I didn't know you were a poker player! I actually think you are spot on about the west's overestimation of Putin. As for resolve, I think core Europe and the US are united (Germany's shifting position has been remarkable and long needed). But I wonder about countries such as Italy, and other peripheral parts of Europe. </p> <p>Europe has yet to get through the long cold winter, and while Germany has socked away its 80 per cent of gas reserves, which is enough to make it through to spring without a major geopolitical event, I'm guessing there will need to be some fiscal transfers to nations that are in weaker positions with energy. This has always been the core question in Europe — will richer nations be willing to share with poorer ones, as is the case among US states (which, it must be said, do so increasingly unwillingly). In this case, I think we will see co-operation because the Russian threat still looms large (as you know, it's easier to be optimistic from the US.) </p> <p>On a different note, since you flag Clyde's piece, I wonder if we are overestimating China, too . . . </p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d32df1bb-409b-497c-9477-8cf04332e875\"><strong>Is it 1939, or 1963?</strong></a><strong>'<br></strong>“So far, America has adopted a strategic ambiguity policy on Taiwan, and it worked: it complicated any Chinese calculus and it prevented any Taiwan aspiration toward independence.
