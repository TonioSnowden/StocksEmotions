  "title": "These Birkenstocks just sold for $218,750 at auction. They belonged to Steve Jobs. There appears to be a growing collectibles market for all things related to the Apple co-founder â€” including a 'well used' pair of sandals retaining imprints of Jobs's feet",
  "text": "<p>\"Steve Jobs wore these sandals during many pivotal moments\" in the company's history, the Julien's site noted.</p><p>Obviously, the footwear wasn't in mint condition. The auction house described the sandals as \"well used, but [they] still appear intact,\" adding that each \"sandal features its original Birkenstock adjustable buckles and Birkenstock stamping on the inner edge of the suede leather foot straps. The cork and jute footbed retains the imprint of Steve Jobs' feet, which had been shaped after years of use.\"</p><p>This is hardly the first occasion on which personal Jobs effects have come up for sale. Earlier this year, an auction held by the RR auction house featured such offerings as a 1982 note from Jobs (it sold for $124,998) and a Jobs business card (it sold for $13,289).</p><p>Still, the footwear auction appears to show there's no telling what some people will pay for anything connected to the tech titan, who died in 2011 at the age of 56, just a year after being tapped as CEO of the Decade by MarketWatch. Julien's originally estimated the sandals would sell for between $60,000 and $80,000.</p><p>These Birkenstocks just sold for $218,750 at auction. They belonged to Steve Jobs.</p>",
