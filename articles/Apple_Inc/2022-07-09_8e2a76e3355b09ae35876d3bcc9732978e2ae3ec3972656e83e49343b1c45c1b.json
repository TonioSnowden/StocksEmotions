  "text": "<p>The ultimate prize is the cobalt that will be extracted from the rock. An essential component of batteries in phones, laptops and electric cars, which are now the biggest source of demand, cobalt is at the heart of the green economy. Its consumption is expected to rise six-fold by 2050, according to the authors of an IMF paper published last year. However, they also noted that cobalt supply could be a bottleneck in the move to cleaner energy.</p><p>To understand why, consider Congo's copper belt, from which 60-70% of the world's cobalt is extracted (see map). Most of Congo's cobalt is a by-product of large copper mines which cannot quickly increase their output and have little incentive to do so unless copper prices also rise. The other big source of supply in Congo is so-called \"artisanal\" mining. Small-scale informal miners dig up about 15% of Congo's cobalt. That is more than the entire output of Russia, the world's second-largest producer (see chart).</p><p>Artisanal miners are critical to global supply. They hand-dig higher-grade ores than those produced by large mechanised mines and can act as swing producers. Yet Congo's small miners face immense obstacles, which prevent them from reaping the rewards of the clean-energy revolution.</p><p>Chief among these problems is that small mines are dangerous and polluting. International NGOs have reported on horrendous incidents of miners being killed when tunnels collapse and of children as young as seven digging for cobalt. After a report in 2016 by Amnesty International on the human cost of artisanal mines, a number of large mobile-phone and car companies pledged to eliminate artisanal cobalt from the batteries they used and to improve safety in small mines. Six years on, too little has changed.</p><p>Part of the reason why the lot of small-scale miners has not improved is because of the way they are pushed to the margins of the industry. In 2019 the army evicted 5,000-8,000 miners from the Tenke Fungurume Mine, which is owned by China Molybdenum. Still, people returned to the mine, roughly 100km from Kolwezi, even in the face of violence. \"Security is chasing us, beating us,\" says Generose Yandaya, who washes rocks to support her orphaned grandchildren. \"I want them to go to school. The problem is there is no money and mining is the only job.\"</p><p>Roughly 140,000-200,000 people in the copper belt work as artisanal miners. Most earn less than $10 per day, according to Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR). That is still more than most get in a country where 73% earn less than $1.90 a day. Children work at 25-30% of mines. Kitenge Mami, a teenager in Fungurume, says she goes to the quarry \"because I don't want to be a beggar\". Mining powers the wider economy: the motorcycle-taxi drivers transporting three sack-laden miners at a time; coiffed women selling \"I heart DRC\" sacks for collecting rocks. One study suggests 60% of households in the region rely on artisanal mining for their livelihoods.</p><p>Pollution is rife. Fathers with mining jobs are unusually likely to have children with birth defects. A law limiting pit depths to 30m is widely flouted. Collapses are common. \"There are no statistics but many, many are dying,\" says Donat Kambola Lenge, a human-rights lawyer. George Ngome, a pastor, says he presides over lots of funerals for miners without identity papers. \"Their families never know.\"</p><p>By law miners must belong to co-operatives. Often these are little more than labour gangs controlled by bigwigs. This year the provincial government named as its new mining minister the head of one of the largest co-operatives. The trading depots must be owned by Congolese. But they are often financed by Chinese traders. Every depot is colloquially known as La Maison Chinoise. At one your correspondent's journalistic interest is conflated with the commercial sort, leading to an offer to The Economist: \"You can also exploit our ores.\"</p><p>It is mostly miners who seem to be getting exploited. Some of them say that traders' scales and spectrometers (used to measure the concentration of cobalt) are rigged. They complain about a litany of unofficial \"taxes\" imposed by state agencies, chiefs, police and security guards, who can make $250 a night in bribes. \"We have laws but there is no respect for the law,\" says Mr Lenge. \"Government is just corrupted.\"</p><p>Artisanal cobalt is trucked from trading depots to refineries where it may be blended with ore from big mines. \"Despite the efforts of some companies to portray industrial [large-scale] mining and artisanal mining as completely distinct,\" argues the Natural Resource Governance Institute, an NGO based in New York, \"the boundaries between the two are permeable.\"</p><p>The international firms that trade, refine and use cobalt have tried to understand what happens in their supply chains. Apple, for example, lists all of its cobalt refiners. Many companies use RCS Global, a consultancy with auditing staff permanently stationed at ten artisanal mines.</p><p>Some try to use less cobalt from Congo, especially the artisanal sort. BMW says it buys exclusively from Australia and Morocco. Tesla is producing batteries that use much less cobalt. And firms are sponsoring initiatives to make life better for miners. The Fair Cobalt Alliance, which counts Tesla and Google among its members, is improving safety at an artisanal mine and renovating schools to give parents more reason to keep their kids away from pits. The Responsible Cobalt Initiative, an association of German car firms and industrial giants, wants to offer safety training.</p><p>But critics say this is not enough. \"There is artisanal cobalt in supply chains, even if it is not acknowledged,\" says Benjamin Katz of the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. \"And there is very little being done to improve conditions.\" A consultant to large firms adds: \"You have a group of downstream businesses that get their annual auditor report, pretend to be virtuous and go back to selling phones and cars.\"</p><p>In 2019 the Congolese government proposed giving a subsidiary of Gécamines, the state miner, a monopoly over the buying of artisanal cobalt. \"We are going to eliminate child labour,\" said Albert Yuma, then the boss of Gécamines. \"Perhaps not today, but tomorrow, the Congo will be the equivalent of OPEC [for cobalt].\" As part of the proposal some revenue would go towards improving mine safety.</p><p>There are plenty of moral incentives to reform artisanal mines but not enough market ones. \"There is a double standard,\" argues Mickael Daudin of PACT, an American NGO. \"The approach is: 'We will help you but we don't want to buy from you.'\" Firms argue that Congo ought to clarify the legal status of artisanal sites and that rich-country governments should be clear about what amounts to a responsible standard for cobalt, as is the case with \"blood diamonds\". Both steps could allow artisanal cobalt into the market legitimately and improve the lot of Congo's people.</p><p>In Kolwezi, Pastor Ngembe watches a Christian channel on TV, seeking inspiration for his sermon later. The topic is that age-old question: \" DRC is a rich country, so why are so many people poor?\"</p>",
