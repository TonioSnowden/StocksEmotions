Several former employees of stock-trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. are building a new fintech startup for small businesses, San Francisco-based Parafin Inc., WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.</p><p>Parafin, which raised $34 million from investors including Robinhood backers Ribbit Capital and Thrive Capital, is reaching small businesses via partners to offer online cash advances, a type of financing that's repaid as a percentage of a business's daily sales. Parafin is an early-stage alternative to the likes of Square Inc.'s Square Capital, Stripe Inc.'s Stripe Capital and other providers of financing for small businesses.</p><p>One of Parafin's first clients is Mindbody Inc., a software provider to tens of thousands of fitness and other small businesses. It will use Parafin to power its Mindbody Capital financing arm, according to a spokesperson.

Today, most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries, which have become more powerful and affordable over the years but have limitations, including the risks of catching fire. The configuration has the potential to deliver faster charging times and make the packs safer by eliminating the flammable electrolyte solution used in lithium-ion batteries, auto executives and analysts say. Still, the technology remains costly and relatively unproven in real-world applications, a hurdle that is expected to take years to solve for the mass market.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Energize Ventures closed its second flagship fund with $330 million in commitments to continue investing in technologies and software across renewable energy, mobility, cybersecurity, battery storage, critical infrastructure and climate resiliency.
