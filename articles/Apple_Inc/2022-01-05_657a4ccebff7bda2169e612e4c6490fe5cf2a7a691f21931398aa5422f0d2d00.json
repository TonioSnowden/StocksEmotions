  "text": "<p>A lawyer for Mr. Cuomo didn't return requests to comment. He has denied the charge, and his lawyer said Mr. Apple's timing was politically motivated. The former governor was set to be arraigned Friday in Albany City Court.</p><p>Mr. Soares, a Democrat, said his office found Ms. Commisso cooperative and credible, but it was dropping the charge because \"after review of all the available evidence we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial.\"</p><p>\"I, like most New Yorkers, remain deeply troubled by allegations like the ones at issue here,\" Mr. Soares said. \"Although avenues for criminal prosecution in these cases are sometimes limited, I encourage victims of workplace harassment and abuse to continue to come forward and bring these issues to light so that these important discussions can continue.\"</p><p>The criminal charge represented the most pressing legal concern for Mr. Cuomo, who is also being investigated for the potential misuse of state resources in the production of his pandemic memoir, as well as the state's Covid-19 policies in nursing homes. He has denied wrongdoing on both fronts.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo resigned from office in August amid an impeachment inquiry and after an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James concluded he sexually harassed multiple women, including Ms. Commisso. Mr. Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately, and said Ms. James, a fellow Democrat, was politically motivated.</p><p>Prosecutors informed Ms. Commisso of their decision not to move forward with the case during a meeting on Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ms. Commisso didn't return messages seeking comment.</p><p>The Albany Times Union earlier reported the meeting Monday.</p><p>Brian Premo, an attorney representing Ms. Commisso, said she had no control over the prosecutors' decision. \"The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Apple didn't return calls seeking comment.</p><p>Ms. Commisso told Ms. James's investigators that Mr. Cuomo groped her breast over her bra after she was summoned to help him use his cellphone in the Executive Mansion.</p><p>The former governor has said he often hugged and kissed people he met at events.</p><p>Mr. Apple's investigator included portions of Ms. Commisso's sworn testimony along with their complaint, as well as other records corroborating her presence at the mansion on Dec. 7, 2020. The complaint didn't attach another part of Ms. Commisso's testimony in which she said Mr. Cuomo slammed the door of his office after groping her rather than before.</p><p>Mr. Soares's office had pushed back Mr. Cuomo's arraignment date, saying in a Nov. 4 letter that Mr. Apple's complaint was \"potentially defective\" because it didn't include proof that Ms. Commisso's statement to Ms. James was made under oath. And \"even more troubling,\" Mr. Soares said, the sheriff's filing \"excluded other portions of her testimony where she described the very same acts described in the complaint.\"</p>",
