  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  The We That Didn't Work  ---  Adam Neumann and Masayoshi Son pushed WeWork to new heights as they challenged  each other to think big and bet billions. When their relationship unraveled, WeWork did too.  ----  By Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell",
  "text": "<p>   Adam Neumann and Masayoshi Son were negotiating a possible $20 billion check when Mr. Son pulled up an image of Yoda on his iPad. </p><p>   It was summer 2018 and Mr. Son's tech conglomerate, SoftBank Group Corp., had already pumped over $4 billion into WeWork, the shared office space startup Mr. Neumann co-founded eight years earlier. Now Mr. Neumann was trying to get Mr. Son to buy a majority stake in WeWork. It would have been the largest acquisition ever of a startup, part of a bid to turbocharge a three-pronged strategy to dominate global real estate. </p><p>   Mr. Son, a risk-taking investor who likened his gut-based strategy of \"use the force\" to that of the bat-eared Star Wars Jedi, was visibly excited that his new disciple was pushing for such an ambitious plan. Mr. Neumann, more than 20 years younger than Mr. Son and roughly a foot taller, charted out gargantuan growth projections in presentation after presentation throughout the summer. Mr. Son, scribbling on his iPad, calculated WeWork would be worth $10 trillion in a decade, more than 10 times the price tag of Apple at the time, the world's most valuable company. </p><p>   Still, Mr. Son kept urging Mr. Neumann to think bigger. </p><p>   WeWork's salespeople, real-estate professionals and buildings numbered in the low hundreds. Mr. Son, though, told Mr. Neumann each category needed to grow -- to 10,000. On his iPad, he commemorated the dictate. </p><p>   \"10k, 10k, 10k!\" Mr. Son wrote in yellow, above Yoda grasping a green lightsaber. He signed below: \"Masa.\" </p><p>   Fourteen months later, WeWork underwent one of the most spectacular corporate meltdowns of the decade. It aborted an initial public offering, Mr. Neumann was ousted as chief executive, the company's valuation tumbled by nearly $40 billion and Mr. Son -- having never completed the $20 billion deal -- saw his tech-oracle image become fodder for jokes. This account is based on interviews with numerous former and current employees at both WeWork and SoftBank, as well as friends of Mr. Neumann and WeWork investors. WeWork declined to comment, Mr. Son declined to comment through SoftBank and Mr. Neumann didn't respond to a request for comment through a spokesman. </p><p>   The high-profile immolation of the country's most valuable startup was caused by an array of factors including loose corporate governance, loose money and a financial sector thirsty for founders promising vision and innovation. </p><p>   But playing a starring role in WeWork's rise and fall was the relationship between the two entrepreneurs, Mr. Son and Mr. Neumann. The pair often relied on erratic decision making as they made highly consequential decisions with billions of dollars -- decisions that ultimately paved the way for WeWork's implosion. </p><p>   It was a mix of mentor and disciple, competitive rivalry, and some father-and-son dynamics -- resulting in a battle of one upmanship that left both men humiliated and furious with each other, said former and current employees of WeWork and SoftBank. </p><p>   Today, the company is still grappling with the hangover. Now worth $8 billion, down from $47 billion, WeWork is on track to go public, this time through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. It exited some leases taken on by Mr. Neumann with SoftBank's money but must still absorb an enormous amount of office space. Occupancy is at a once-unthinkable 53%. </p><p>   The union of Mr. Son and Mr. Neumann came about largely as a result of geopolitical luck that married two unflinching techno-optimists with extraordinary ambition at the exact right time. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann, a long-haired, energetic entrepreneur, started WeWork after struggling to build a baby-clothes business in New York, where he moved from Israel in 2001. He proved a gifted fundraiser, positioning the office-space company first as a social network, then as a product of the sharing economy -- and raised $1.7 billion from a top roster of the world's investors. </p><p>   To keep up his rapid growth and attain his sky-high visions for the company, he needed far more funding, and Mr. Son was known for writing giant checks. The Tokyo-based investor built up a set of tech and media businesses to become, briefly, the world's richest man in the dot-com boom, before losing nearly everything, he has said. Having rebuilt his empire in the decade-and-a-half since, he was eager to take big swings. </p><p>   Prior attempts by Mr. Neumann and Mr. Son to make a partnership work ended without success. As early as 2014, SoftBank pondered an investment in WeWork, but Mr. Son's subordinates determined it was an overvalued real-estate company, and quickly discarded the concept. </p><p>   That changed by late 2016, when Mr. Son received commitments for more than $60 billion to help fund the world's largest-ever private investment fund, the SoftBank Vision Fund. The main backer was Mohammed bin Salman, the then-deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia who had unexpectedly risen to power in the Al Saud family and wanted to make big moves of the country's wealth away from oil and toward the tech sector. Mr. Son was out fundraising for a fund roughly 30 times the size of the next largest venture-capital fund at the exact right moment. </p><p>   Armed with the Saudi commitments, Mr. Son went hunting for big fish -- startups that could absorb billions of investment and turn them into tens of billions. He met up with Mr. Neumann -- almost a stereotype of the confident, vision-heavy tech startup founder -- after mutual associate Mark Schwartz, a former Goldman Sachs banker, vouched for him. Mr. Son quickly committed to invest over $4 billion after a 12-minute tour of WeWork in late 2016 -- a brief pit stop on his way to meet the president-elect at Trump Tower. </p><p>   By 2018, WeWork's explosive growth engine was burning hot, fueled by SoftBank's cash. The investment made WeWork worth $20 billion, one of the most valuable startups in the country, and WeWork's reach extended across the globe. WeWork's serif-font logo was on buildings in 73 cities in 22 countries. The company that had a single Manhattan office in 2010 now was a global brand, it rented more than 200,000 desks, and it was on track to take in nearly $2 billion in annual revenue. </p><p>   As WeWork grew, aides said they saw Mr. Neumann's sense of self-importance grow too. </p><p>   The excitable salesman had always talked a big game about growth; when WeWork had just a few locations, he told employees it would be worth billions one day. But after SoftBank's investment in 2017, his aspirations soared to a new level. </p><p>   He talked more to aides and friends about WeWork's growing valuation -- and how WeWork would be worth trillions. His lifestyle turned more grandiose. His roster of homes grew to seven, including a $21 million house in the San Francisco Bay Area with a racquetball court and a room shaped like a guitar. He began telling others that he hoped to live forever, and funded the startup Life Biosciences, which researches aging-related diseases. </p><p>   He talked to his employees about WeWork as a company that would last for three hundred years. Or a millennium. </p><p>   He directed SoftBank's cash into a WeWork elementary school that started after he and his wife were frustrated with the lack of suitable options for their children, they told WeWork staff. When a WeWork board member asked Mr. Neumann why the company needed to spend $63 million on a top of the line private jet -- the Gulfstream G650ER -- he responded that Mr. Son had a jet and told him he backed the move. Acquisitions were scattershot; he bought event-planning website Meetup.com. In 2016, Mr. Neumann directed WeWork buy a 42% stake in a company that makes surfing pools. </p><p>   Following a dinner with Walter Isaacson, biographer of Steve Jobs, he gathered staff around to read a complimentary email from the author. He told his employees he wanted Mr. Isaacson to write a biography about him. </p><p>   After he met U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer in the Capitol, he turned to his staff. \"No more mayors,\" he said. \"Only senators from now on.\" </p><p>   To one startup founder, he talked about a link between global affairs and WeWork's size. It wasn't enough for WeWork just to have a big valuation, he told the founder. It needed to have the biggest valuation. That way, he said, when countries started shooting at one another, he would be the one they would have to call to solve their problems. </p><p>   Playing a role in Mr. Neumann's growing ambitions was Mr. Son, who was frequently needling Mr. Neumann to think bigger. </p><p>   At a meal in Tokyo with Mr. Son and Cheng Wei, CEO of Chinese ride-hail giant Didi Global Inc., Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann that the Didi CEO beat out Uber Technologies Inc. in China not because he was smarter than Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Mr. Cheng was crazier, Mr. Son said. </p><p>   On the same Tokyo trip, Mr. Son asked Mr. Neumann who would win a fight between a smart guy and a crazy guy, according to people familiar with the conversation. He told Mr. Neumann that being crazy is how you win and that Mr. Neumann was not crazy enough, according to these people. </p><p>   Roughly a year later at another meeting in Tokyo, Mr. Son clicked on a promotional video of SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes, led by the then 24-year-old Ritesh Agarwal. Oyo was growing far faster than WeWork, Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann, ribbing him about lagging behind his SoftBank-backed counterpart, whom Mr. Son equated with a sibling. </p><p>   \"Your little brother is going to beat you,\" Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann, according to people familiar with the conversation. \"He is being bolder than you.\" </p><p></p>",
