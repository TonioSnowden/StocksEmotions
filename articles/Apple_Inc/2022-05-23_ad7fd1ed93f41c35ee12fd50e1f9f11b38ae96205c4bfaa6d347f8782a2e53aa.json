  "text": "<p>When I was growing up in Singapore, one thing I never found in short supply was the seemingly endless variety of eateries capable of whipping up a satisfying meal at short notice. Famed as both a melting pot of eastern and western cultures and a financial hub, the city-state also wears its reputation as a food haven with pride. </p> <p>It's no surprise, then, that eating is a favoured pastime of Singapore residents. Morning, noon or night, there is hardly an awkward time to feast. A hearty brunch, for instance, is how locals like to indulge between the usual mealtimes. This is especially true on weekends, when you will find everyone from trendy teenagers to young adults, families and expats digging in at a cosy café for hours. One might argue that brunch has edged its way into Singaporean food culture, though I think it has more to do with the plethora of chic places that have opened in recent years, even during the pandemic, to tempt locals' ever-curious taste buds.</p> <p>Brunch in Singapore can be anything a foodie might dream of, from traditional local toasts topped with a generous spread of coconut custard jam, known as <em>kaya</em> (also a breakfast favourite) to perfectly poached eggs and fresh salad. Chase those with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d35bb5e-d33c-4338-8a67-a22785ffb692\">locally brewed thick coffee</a> or an iced latte (with oat milk, of course). These days, new eateries doing brunch tend to serve western-style fare and have become increasingly popular — you'll often find queues at peak hours, especially if pictures of a spot have done the rounds on social media. But be prepared for a heftier bill than at Singapore's ubiquitous <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f18c154-e0ab-4e59-b717-5771af069df2\">food courts</a>, known as hawker centres. </p> <p>Beyond food, the brunch experience in Singapore is also often tied to the setting. Sometimes the atmosphere is more crucial to your enjoyment than the quality of your meal. With that in mind, below are some suggestions on unique brunch destinations in Singapore — places you should visit if your aim is to while away an afternoon in a district where the sights and sounds are also a feast for your senses.</p> <h2>Micro Bakery Red House</h2> <h4>63 East Coast Road, #01-06, Singapore 428776</h4> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Good for:</strong> Baked treats straight from the oven</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Not so good for:</strong> Seating is limited, so you may have to wait for a table if it's busy&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FYI:</strong> Check out the traditional <a href=\"https://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/shophouses-typology/\">shophouses</a> in the area </p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.microbakerykitchen.com/redhouse\"><strong>Website</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/MICRO+red+%7C+house/@1.3054206,103.9010328,17.08z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da187287c2b911:0x9532b3e02fce4cec!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da19c2a37fbc73:0x8e80a428ccdadc8d!8m2!3d1.3053588!4d103.9034576\"><strong>Directions</strong></a></p></li> </ul> <p>The striking red façade that gives this establishment its name is the first thing that will make an impression when you arrive at the Red House. The bakery is situated in eastern Singapore's heritage-rich Katong neighbourhood, known for its traditional shophouses. The building formerly housed the Katong Bakery &amp; Confectionery, for decades a popular bake shop and breakfast spot, and its new tenant Micro continues the tradition with its excellent pastries.</p> <p>But Micro's offering goes beyond baked goods. This is the place to build your own brunch: start with sourdough toast and French butter, and add whatever else you fancy, such as avocado, sausage, scrambled eggs or roast tomatoes. Lighter fare includes homemade granola with seasonal fruits and yoghurt, while other meat-free options are available too, such as nut butter toast with hazelnut, almond, sunflower seeds, sea salt and honey. </p> <p>Slake your thirst with a pink lemongrass and chrysanthemum lemonade while taking in the smells of fresh baking wafting from the oven. After brunch, go for a stroll: the colourful shophouses offer a glimpse of Singapore's past. The district was a residential enclave for Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese or Indian migrants to Singapore who married women from the Malay Archipelago in the 15th century.</p> <h2>Tiong Bahru Bakery&#xa0;</h2> <h4>56 Eng Hoon Street, #01-70, Singapore 160056</h4> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Good for:</strong> A wide variety of goodies</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Not so good for:</strong> A filling meal, if large portions are your thing</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FYI:</strong> Try not to drive here as parking can be difficult during peak periods </p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.tiongbahrubakery.com/\"><strong>Website</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tiong+Bahru+Bakery/@1.2844656,103.8314527,16.99z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1970ae6ce3fb:0x4ae9769058ba1cf9!8m2!3d1.284454!4d103.8336531\"><strong>Directions</strong></a></p></li> </ul> <p>This is the flagship of a chain of bakeries named after the area in which it opened its first branch (not too far from the Central Business District). <a href=\"https://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/tiong-bahru/\">Tiong Bahru</a> is the oldest housing estate in Singapore, where you'll find 1930s-style Streamline Moderne architecture that features lines and curves inspired by cars, planes and ships.</p> <p>This is a mecca for lovers of baked goods, offering a vast selection: try the small sugar brioche — a bun dusted with sweet crystals — the lemon loaf or the apple crumble. Savoury palates will be satisfied too; I recommend the pulled pork bun, and the more adventurous should opt for a smoked-salmon squid-ink roll. Everything goes well with a double espresso or long black coffee. </p> <h2>SPRMRKT at Dempsey Hill</h2> <h4>Dempsey Road, #01-15A Block 8, Singapore 247696</h4> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Good for:</strong> Western-style brunch fare</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Not so good for:</strong> Your finances if you're on a tight budget</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FYI:</strong> It's not easy to reach by public transport — consider taking a taxi</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://sprmrkt.com.sg/locations-menus/sprmrkt-at-dempsey-hill/\"><strong>Website</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/SPRMRKT+at+Dempsey+Hill/@1.3042305,103.807317,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1bd555b6814d:0x19764e79e97da6c7!8m2!3d1.3042251!4d103.8095057\"><strong>Directions</strong></a></p></li> </ul> <p>Once a nutmeg plantation, Dempsey Hill became a military camp under British rule and now has a thriving food scene that is popular with expats. SPRMRKT is situated within a former British army barracks, echoing the colonial past of Singapore before it became an independent state in 1965. </p> <p>This is one of many dining establishments in the area competing for your attention, and it's a nice spot to start a day of café-hopping. A chic interior greets you as you walk in; the layout is clean, angular and more spacious than some of the other places on this list. SPRMRKT does a western-style brunch menu, from eggs Benedict (ham or crab) to avocado toast and buttermilk pancakes (these are soft, fluffy and thicker than the thin and floppy ready-made ones normally found in supermarkets here, so they should fill you up). For something more substantial, go for the breakfast platter: eggs, mushrooms, pork sausages, bacon, tomato, greens and toast. Tasty cocktails, wine and craft beer are available too.</p> <h2>Soek Seng 1954 Bicycle Café</h2> <h4>80 Seletar Aerospace View, #01-01 Aviation Hub, Singapore 797563</h4> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Good for:</strong> Plane- and bike-spotting</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Not so good for:</strong> An amazing meal — the food is decent but not fantastic</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FYI:</strong> Sit alfresco for a good view of the airstrip (but beware of Singapore's sudden heavy rain)</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Website</strong>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soek+Seng+1954+Bicycle+Cafe/@1.4124005,103.8662467,16.94z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da15cd3c3ba213:0x63d1c44ac14f6e67!8m2!3d1.4124209!4d103.8683315\"><strong>Directions</strong></a></p></li> </ul> <p>This is one of those places where the atmosphere is more enticing than the menu. Travellers to Singapore commonly enter via Changi Airport. This eatery is next to the lesser-known <a href=\"https://www.seletarairport.com/\">Seletar Airport</a>, which caters to smaller planes and private jets. </p> <p>Soek Seng 1954 Bicycle Café (vintage bikes hang on the inside walls) serves a wide range of cuisine: dishes include standard western fare such as burgers and steak, Japanese rice bowls and favourites such as beef <em>rendang</em>. There are certainly better versions of these dishes elsewhere in Singapore, but what you are really here for is the unconventional vibe of brunching right next to an airstrip, where you can watch the occasional small plane take off or try to name the different models of aircraft you spot. The smaller size of the planes means that the kind of noise and pollution usually associated with aviation will not ruin your meal.</p> <h2>Miska Café&#xa0;</h2> <h4>31 Ocean Way, 01-07 Quayside Isle, Sentosa Cove, Singapore 098375</h4> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Good for:</strong> Yacht-spotting&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Not so good for:</strong> Leaving your food unattended — birds will try their luck</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FYI:</strong> No public transport here, but a shuttle bus service is available</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.miskacafe.com/\"><strong>Website</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Miska+Cafe/@1.2472363,103.8401098,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x31da1eb42ce67f5d:0x6240f16e110ebd80!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1eb5d151da5f:0x431fa29470e01c25!8m2!3d1.2472309!4d103.8422985\"><strong>Directions</strong></a></p></li> </ul> <p>Sentosa Cove is known as the Monaco of Singapore, an area where the ultra rich live and play with expensive toys such as yachts and supercars on a tourist island linked to the main city-state. (Odds are those who landed with their private jets at Seletar Airport may be headed here.) From your seat in Miska Café, you'll be able to view the scores of pristine vessels on display at the Sentosa Cove dock while tucking into a Mediterranean-inspired brunch. You can have a hearty breakfast steak with halloumi cheese and pita bread, or the <em>shakshouka</em> — oven-baked eggs with feta, roast stewed tomato, peppers and onion. Take note: if you're dining on the terrace, don't leave your table if there's food on your plate — the local mynahs and crows will dash down for scraps if it is unoccupied. It is not uncommon to see staff rush to clear plates when the birds swoop in.</p> <p><em>Where's your favourite place for brunch in Singapore?
