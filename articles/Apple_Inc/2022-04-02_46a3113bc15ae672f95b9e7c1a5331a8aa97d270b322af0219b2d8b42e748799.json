  "text": "<p>\n  In over 40 years of running, I've never come home with regret. It was perhaps natural then that in early 2020, after years of curiosity about ultramarathons -- runs longer than 26.2 miles that often take place among forests and peaks -- I trained for and ran my first. Now the best part of my day is when I push away from the computer. Quitting time means it's time to run. At 51 years old, I'm no threat to the greyhounds that make the podium. But my daily run remains my five o'clock beer-and-a-shot. As I pound over the mountain trails behind my home for four or five hours, I sort through the conflicts and tangles of the day and find a primal sense of joy. </p><p>\n  You don't have to sign up for a 50-miler to try trail running yourself. Just make sure you are prepared for the unique challenges of running off road. You needn't replace all your gear, but with just a few additions, such a water filter, and upgrades -- say, more structured shoes -- you'll be able to hit the trails without issue. Who knows? Maybe that ultramarathon won't seem so out of reach. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1 | On-Demand Agua </p><p>\n  On long runs, I try to drink a minimum of two liters of water -- which weighs as much as your average house cat. Instead of trying to carry Garfield on my back, I dip the soft-shelled LifeStraw Peak bottle into any brook, stream or lake I encounter. The bottle cap's built-in filter removes virtually all trace of bacteria, microplastics and parasites like Giardia. $33, lifestraw.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2 | Supportive Stakes </p><p>\n  When you hit a steep section of trail, running poles give your tired legs some real assistance. A pair of Leki's carbon UltraTrail FX.One Superlite poles weigh just 9.6 ounces, less than that of a full can of soda. They feature a newly designed cork handgrip that gives you great power transfer. When you're ready to put them aside, a quick-release tab frees your hand with a flick of your thumb, and the poles collapse for quick storage. $220, leki.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  3 | Tough Trainers </p><p>\n  I love the comfortable, extra-cushioned shoes from brands like Hoka, but running with them can feel like bouncing on marshmallows. Trail runners crave shoes that offer support to their lower legs' myriad muscles. The Akasha II from La Sportiva, a brand known for shorter-distance mountain running shoes, is a good middle ground. These sneakers are plenty cozy, but also feature a firm chassis that will keep your hooves stable on funky terrain. $150, sportiva.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  4 | Wanderer's Insurance </p><p>\n  The Coros Vertix 2 is basically a riff on an Apple Watch that's been loaded up with extra features for the outdoor adventurer. The big plus is battery life: A single charge gives you 60 days of use. That drops down to almost 6 days if you're actively using the Vertix's sophisticated location tracking software, which minimizes interference from dense forest, towering rock walls and skyscrapers, but it's still nearly 8 times more than the new watch from Cupertino offers. You'll (almost) always be able to find your way back out of the forest. $700, coros.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  5 | Running Sunnies </p><p>\n  Just as you use sunscreen to protect your neck, you should use sunglasses to protect your eyes. The Julbo Aero sunglasses are ultralight, don't jostle as you run, and, even if you're lathered in sweat, don't fog up. Unlike a lot of fashion running glasses, the Aeros are wide enough to protect your eyes from sideways rays too. Light conditions change all the time during a long run -- from forest gloam to bright sun -- so splurge on Julbo's photochromic Reactiv lens. They lighten or darken as needed, so you're not fumbling to pull the specs on or off when you need to focus on the trail. $220, julbo.com </p><p></p>",
