  "text": "<p>And he's putting some fairly precise guesswork out there. \"I estimate that a rise in rates from where they are to about 4.5% will produce about a 20% negative impact on equity prices,\" Dalio said in a LinkedIn post dated Tuesday.</p><p>Some are forecasting the Fed could hike interest rates by 100 basis points next week, a move not seen since the likewise inflationary 80s. The central bank's short-term rate hovers between 2.25% to 2.5%, but Nomura, for one, sees that rate headed to 4.75% by 2023.</p><p>But Dalio thinks interest rates could even reach the higher end of a 4.5%-to-6% range. \"This will bring private sector credit growth down, which will bring private sector spending, and hence the economy down with it,\" he says.</p><p>Behind this prediction is the Bridgewater Associates founder belief that the market is severely underestimating where inflation will end up — at 2.6% over the next 10 years versus what he sees as 4.5% to 5% in the medium term, barring shocks.</p><p>Read: Why a single U.S. inflation report roiled global financial markets — and what comes next</p><p>As for what happens when people start losing money in the markets — the so-called \"wealth effect\" — he expects less spending as they and their lenders grow more cautious.</p><p>\"The upshot is that it looks likely to me that the inflation rate will stay significantly above what people and the Fed want it to be (while the year-over-year inflation rate will fall), that interest rates will go up, that other markets will go down, and that the economy will be weaker than expected, and that is without consideration given to the worsening trends in internal and external conflicts and their effects.\"</p><p>Hear from Ray Dalio at MarketWatch's Best New Ideas in Money Festival on Sept. 21 and 22 in New York.
