  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>As directed by Peter Farrelly (\"Green Book\"), \"The Greatest Beer Run Ever\" asks a lot of an audience—to swallow a story that's fantastical (even though mostly true); to buy into an often-maudlin, often-slapdash reproduction of Chickie's world; and to believe that actor Zac Efron is 26 years old. An ex-Marine turned merchant seaman, the real John Donohue was a patron of several of the many Irish bars that used to populate the Inwood section of Manhattan and, like his fellow habitués, was indignant about antiwar protests and what he saw as a lack of support for the troops. How patriotism quite translates into beer is one of the story's mysteries.</p><p>\"I wish our guys could see that the vast minority of the country's behind them,\" says one pal. You mean vast majority, someone suggests, to which the first guy responds, \"I wouldn't go that far.\" The bartender, called the Colonel (a perfect Bill Murray), is the voice of national unity and a certain grandiosity. \"I'd like to go over to Vietnam,\" he says, \"track down the neighborhood guys and give 'em a beer.\" Chickie, suddenly struck by how little he's actually doing to back up his pro-war pontificating, says, \"I can do that.\"</p><p>Which he can, sort of: He signs on as an oiler on a munitions ship heading to Vietnam by way of Panama and when he gets there makes his way north, evading all manner of peril including enemy fire and a near-assassination by the CIA. He has very little awareness at any time of the danger he's in, or the danger he puts his buddies in by intruding on their war. \"Every once in a while,\" says a soldier, \"you run into a guy who's too dumb to get killed.\" He's looking at Chickie. It's hard to sympathize with a character who carries calamity with him like a duffel bag full of beer cans. (By the way, there are at least four cases of PBR in that bag and Mr. Efron totes it around like a hat box.) At the same time, Chickie, as portrayed by Mr. Efron, is often endearingly clueless and unwilling to take \"impossible\" for an answer.</p><p>\"The Greatest Beer Run Ever\" gets more serious as it goes along, as it must: The more of the war Chickie sees, the more he's aware of how complicated it is. There's very little political messaging, as such: Chickie's sister, Christine the antiwar demonstrator (Ruby Ashbourne Serkis, sounding more Brooklyn than Inwood), makes the standard pro-peace arguments, which are rendered bloodless in the script by Brian Hayes Currie, Pete Jones and Mr. Farrelly. William Westmoreland and Lyndon Johnson, U.S. Army commander and American president, respectively, are both portrayed as skewing the truth, something even Chickie begins to see as he travels around, evading North Vietnamese and American M.P.s. alike. On the home front, the Colonel, representing an entire older generation, is still fighting the Battle of the Bulge, bewildered by resistance to any war waged by his country. In Saigon, war photographer Coates (Russell Crowe, breathing heavily) laughs/sneers at Chickie's naiveté.</p><p>Our hero is somewhere in the middle, punched in the face by realpolitik yet not quite willing to believe that the many friends he lost didn't die for something real. The beer run itself, after all, is about loyalty—which, as the movie instructs, sometimes requires seeing things in a way that meets one's needs. \"The Greatest Beer Run Ever\" is far too interested in having a good time to get too heavy about a bygone American argument, but there are truths to be found in the film, by peering through its various fogs of war.</p><p>Mr. Anderson is the Journal's TV critic.</p><p>'The Greatest Beer Run Ever' Review: Brews for the Boys</p>",
