  "text": "<p>If “apples” was an idiom for a certain kind of crazy, the way “nuts” or “bananas” are, Patrick Tallec would be “apples”. Five years ago, in his mid-forties, he gave up a career in TV production and bought a farmhouse near where he grew up in Brittany, with four hectares of meadow sloping down to a trout stream. There he began to establish an orchard of forgotten varieties of apples and set up a cider press in an outbuilding. </p> <p>It was a childhood dream that had become an almost obsessive passion. Having taught himself cider making from books and apprenticeships in his holidays, Tallec's Ar Marc'h Glaz cider (“the blue horse” in Breton) is now being solicited by Michelin-starred chefs and TV food programmes showcasing the best produce in France.&#xa0;</p> <p>Tallec's story is an example of how farmers and artisans are rediscovering old varietals and using traditional methods as a base for innovation, forging a new movement in agriculture and food production. Along the way, pioneers such as Tallec are also showing how food can reconnect us to lost histories and cultures. </p> <p>His cider is delicious: orange-amber coloured; thickly apple-rich; wet leaves and windfalls, dry velvet on the roof of my mouth. “There must be a balance of sugar and acidity in my cider, but also in our work and our life,” Tallec told me. “This is the vertebral column that runs through everything I do.”</p> <p>The apples we know are the love child of the wild apples of the Tian Shan mountains in China and the small, hard, bitter European crab apple. A hardy traveller, domesticated five or six thousand years ago and carried along the silk route, the apple became popular because it was useful; a fruit that could be stored through the winter, fermented into alcohol and vinegar or fed to pigs. Apples are grown all over the world, and in Europe, and places that Europeans colonised, they became a mainstay, part of the landscape, selectively bred through generations for eating or baking or brewing.</p> <p>Apples, Tallec said, are like people: two parent apple trees produce an offspring that is a genetic individual. Every pip can grow up to be a new variety. In order to propagate a single variety, trees must be grafted, essentially cloned. Through the 19th century, new apple varieties were either bred by enthusiasts (Cox's Orange Pippin, bred by George Cox) or were chance discoveries (Granny Smith, named after Maria Ann Smith, who found green crunchy apples growing in her garden in Australia in the 1860s). </p> <p>In the 20th century, the globalisation and industrialisation of the food supply chain created a standardisation of produce; apples were often bred not only for taste but for appearance, ease of harvesting or their ability to withstand transportation. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-evil-reign-of-the-red-delicious/379892/\">Red Delicious</a>, with its shiny scarlet skin and its perfect apple-shouldered silhouette, was America's most-grown variety from 1968 until 2018 despite being tasteless and mealy. Popular modern varieties such as Jazz and Pink Lady were developed to have the perfect balance of crisp and sweet and tart — “they are very good, but they all taste the same” Tallec lamented — and are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50048782\">trademarked and grown in different countries</a> under licensing agreements, much like a fast-food franchise.</p> <p>Local apple varieties with woolly flesh or a sour flavour were abandoned. Across 300 years, American farmers bred more than 15,000 different apples; 80 per cent have fallen out of use over the past century. In the UK, 90 per cent of traditional orchards have gone since the second world war (although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/british-apple-boom-forgotten-varieties-apple-day\">some have been replaced</a> with modern varieties of apple trees). In Brittany alone, there were an estimated 5,000 varieties before the first world war, of which about half are no longer grown.</p> <p>As a young boy in the 1970s, Tallec remembers coming back from school one day to see that the orchard across the road from his home had been razed to make way for a housing development. At the time, the French government was subsidising farmers to grub up their apple trees, encouraging a more efficient and specialised agriculture. Small family farms disappeared into large fields of monoculture. </p> <p>For centuries, Brittany had been a poor region, far from Paris; unindustrialised and dirt-floor rural. Cider was the everyday drink;&#xa0;farm workers used to be contractually entitled to a litre of cider a day.&#xa0;While the new intensive agriculture brought welcome prosperity, cider, rough and rustic, fell out of favour and was relegated to a tourist novelty served in seaside crêperies. Even Tallec's grandfather chopped down his apple trees.</p>  <p><strong>Gabe Cook, Britain's foremost “ciderologist”</strong>, who has a book and a podcast under that title, told me that it was probably the Normans who taught the English cider making; but then again, he asserted, it was the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-39963098\">English who invented the champenoise method</a> to make cider (adding a little sugar to promote a little fizz) decades before Dom Pérignon made his first champagne in the 16th century. Much modern cider is industrially produced, often from apple-juice concentrate with added yeast and sugar to speed and control fermentation; then it is pasteurised to stabilise the brew, filtered for clarity and carbonated. </p> <p>British and French cider have the same root, but in recent times English cider has been brewed to be as crisp and refreshing as lager — essentially “a beerification of cider”, Cook said, “lighter, fresher, leaner, an easier drink for the mainstream”. French cider tends to retain more of the original sweetness of the fruit.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I&#xa0;want to build a cider that is a cathedral of taste,” Tallec said. “So big and grand that when people drink it they will say, ‘Wow.'” In spring, when the trees are flowering, Tallec drives around the countryside, looking out for apple blossom in&#xa0;villages and gardens and fields. </p> <p>“Most people have no idea what they have,” he said. “They will say, ‘Oh, I don't know why my grandfather planted them.'” </p> <p>In the autumn he goes back and (with permission) picks a few apples, tastes them, tries to identify them and will often take a branch to graft on to his root stock. “Every time I plant a tree in the ground and I save a variety, I am struggling against the absence, this terrible feeling of seeing a land without trees.” He now has more than 260 different varieties of apples growing to experiment with. </p> <p>Tallec discovered that, from the Romans to the Middle Ages through to the 19th century, right up until modern industrial processes were applied to brewing, all the difficulties of preservation, of fermentation control, of clarity and taste had been figured out by generations of cider makers before him. “I learnt a lot about ciders from Pliny — how to use seawater in ciders, for example.” (The salt acts as a preservative and helps to clarify the cider.) “I am not inventing anything new. I feel I am part of a continuum.” </p> <p>As apple varieties have been lost, so too has the knowledge and experience of how to weather floods and famines, apple blights and sour ferments. We will need, Tallec said, the genetic diversity of many apple varieties to adapt to the challenges of climate change and an agriculture that is less chemical-dependent.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the UK and the US, there is a <a href=\"https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2018/09/21/Forget-craft-beer-the-craft-cider-movement-has-arrived!-Crafty-Nectar-on-craft-cider\">bubbling craft cider movement</a>, much like the craft beer movement, increasingly interested in playing with different apple varieties; fermenting, as Tallec does, using only the natural yeasts present on the apple skins; brewing from single varieties; relearning the art of blending. In France, the trend has yet to catch on (in part because a tradition of small artisanal cider makers has remained.) Farmers and locals often ask Tallec why he is&#xa0;growing all those old apples <em>de merde</em>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Different apples, he explained, have different tastes, and also different properties. “People think an apple tastes bad,” he said, “that it is too mealy or fluffy or woolly, it doesn't crunch when you bite into it, or it tastes faded or bland or too sweet or too sharp. There are some apples that taste of nothing, but when you ferment them into cider they produce a wonderful fizz.” </p> <p>Some apples store well, some mature over time, some bake to make creamy compotes, some distil into excellent hardcore hooch called Calvados in Normandy, Lambig in Brittany.</p> <p>Once, for example, Tallec found a tree with apples that were as farinaceous and bitter as chestnuts. He tried to brew cider from them, but even after three months it was horrid and undrinkable. He kept it in the corner, another failed experiment. But when he tasted it again, after two more months, it was transformed, “as sweet as caramel. I bottled it and now I sell a lot of it as a single variety, Jeanne Renard. It was a good lesson.”</p>  <p><strong>In Tallec's kitchen</strong>, we tasted different apples and shooed away errant chickens. A small yellow apple was lemony with a bright edge of mint. “It's Douce Melen, a typical Breton cider apple used to add sweetness and volume.” Acidity, he explained, lengthens a cider's taste. He pointed to the interior flesh of one of the apples, already turning brownish — a sign of heavy tannins. “Quick oxidation and tannins are super-good for ageing the cider. Modern apples don't brown so quickly because people don't want this characteristic.”</p> <p>Identifying apples is tricky. Tallec pointed out their differentiating characteristics — the contour of an apple's shoulders, its colour, whether it was streaked with yellow or red and blushed with pink; rougher “rust” patches, the length of the stem (modern varieties are developed to ripen on the tree, with longer and stronger stems); the architecture of the indented calyx on the bottom; the shape of the “heart”, which is the interior membrane around the seed casing. Most of the time, Tallec admitted, he has no idea what apple he is looking at.&#xa0;</p> <p>He takes these unknown apples to a friend, Jean-Pierre Roullaud, a fellow autodidact apple expert and founder of Arborépom, one of many amateur associations in France dedicated to conserving old varieties. (There are several in the UK too, including the Orchard Project; in the US, apple conservators are known affectionately as apple detectives.) Roullaud is a pretty excellent cider maker himself, but I had a sense that, for him, rediscovering apples was less about taste than about the stories and histories that the apples describe.&#xa0;</p> <p>“For example, there is a variety called La Galleuse,” Roullaud told me, “that is always found in the gardens of former vicarages or near to churches. There are peasant apples and bourgeois apples and aristocratic apples. You will often find certain varieties in the ground of a château that you do not find elsewhere in the village — the peasants wouldn't have dared to grow the same varieties as the gentry.”</p>  <p><strong>This year the Hereford Cider Museum</strong> (the world's largest cider museum), together with Brightspace Foundation and the National Trust in Herefordshire, is curating an online exhibition, “Apples and People”, telling apple stories, from Eve to Snow White, to wassailing and Cézanne and how the apple has now returned to China — enjoyed, ironically, as an exotic import. As&#xa0;David Marshall of the <a href=\"https://www.cidermuseum.co.uk/\">Hereford Cider Museum</a> told me, “There is absolutely a local and cultural connection with apples, history and people and places. They evoke memories, they are part of the embedded history.”</p> <p>Roullaud has found an apple called the Belle de Kerdrezec, descended from a graft brought back from the Crimea in the backpack of a French soldier. Once, he identified a variety called Catshead. “And I said to the lady [who brought it to him], ‘You must live between Crozon and Morgat [on a far west peninsula of Brittany].' She was astonished. I was able to tell her that this English variety had been planted by the Peugeot family who settled in that area after the first [world] war.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Roullaud poured us some of his cider, made from a blend of apples grown in a conservancy orchard he first planted 20 years ago and bottled in an old champagne bottle. It was four years old, dark marmalade coloured and delicious in the way that complex wine can be. I drank it slowly. Flavour is complexity. Complexity is diversity. And diversity, we are beginning to understand, in our food supply chains and our diets, is resilience.</p> <p>“People remember the taste of an apple from childhood, an apple that grew in their grandfather's farm or that they used to steal from the neighbours. I call it the <em>pomme memoire</em>,” said Roullaud. “It's a connection with childhood, with the land, with family and history, to a time lost.” </p> <p><em>Wendell Steavenson writes about food and other things</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first. </em></p><p>Source:  Wendell Steavenson 2021 'A cider maker extraordinaire' FT.com 29 May.
