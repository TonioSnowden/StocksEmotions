  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: Bags Are Back --- Nothing says 're-entry' like a brand new bag, an accessory that's kept a low profile for months. Here, 38 women's, men's and kids' styles to carry into post-pandemic life.",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Newkirk is not in the minority. \"In the beginning, the world seemed to stop altogether,\" said Hallie Spradlin, director of accessories at Fashion Snoops, a trend-forecasting agency. But by last summer, cooped-up men and women \"were looking for a mood boost . . . and started investing in bags.\" Yumi Shin, chief merchant of New York department store Bergdorf Goodman, called handbags \"pandemic proof\" -- particularly, she added, when they're in perky hues like tangerine or neon green. Perhaps that's because they represent optimism: Buying a bag designed to tote essentials between home, school, the office and even the airport suggests that we'll soon return to some version of our bustling former lives. Paul-Sebastian Japaz, a New York painter, said he began building \"an arsenal\" of bags last summer. His buys range from Telfar's vegan Shopping Bag to an as-yet-unused leather Prada tote. Mr. Japaz, 29, cheerily called it the \"back-to-school bag.\"</p><p>However, as our lifestyles have shifted, so too have our handbag tastes. The awkwardly bulky, top-handle work bags so prevalent pre-pandemic have been ousted by smaller, more versatile options that facilitate a lighter existence. Giana Ballard, 29, who owns a New York photography studio, recently splurged on a canvas Balenciaga bag with a long shoulder strap. Before the pandemic, she used different bags for day and night, work and play. Now she wears her roughly 8-inch-tall bucket bag (which fits her iPhone, camera, lipstick and a crucial can of pamplemousse LaCroix) for morning walks, afternoon errands and outdoor dinners. Once she needs to carry heftier cargo like, say, a laptop, again, Ms. Ballard plans to team her modest new pal with a roomier tote.</p><p>Curt Myers, a Boston public-affairs consultant and erstwhile traveler, has bought three bags during the pandemic -- a leather duffel and two backpacks. Mr. Myers, 28, admitted that he \"never really looked at bags\" before, but with a surfeit of time and a new, social distancing-inspired love of hiking, he sought pieces that fused style and utility. His usual habit of searching for cities to visit was irrational, he said. \"The alternative was to buy [these bags] that symbolized travel.\"</p><p>Katrina Tracy waited until she was vaxxed to splash out on a faux-snakeskin Steve Madden crossbody-cum-fanny pack. \"It was a little bit of an affirmation of, 'We're getting back to it!'\" said Ms. Tracy, 34, who works in human resources in Los Angeles. She debuted the chain-embellished bag when visiting her grandmother, whom she'd seen only once in the past year. \"It was fun to have a conversation with her about my shiny new purse,\" she said. Her grandmother thought it was adorable.</p><p>---</p><p>30 More Women's, Men's and Children's Bags to Carry You Forward</p><p>1.
