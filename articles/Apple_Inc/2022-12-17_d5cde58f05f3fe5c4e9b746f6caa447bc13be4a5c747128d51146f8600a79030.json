  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  The Free Market Is the Real  Threat to Apple's App Store",
  "text": "<p>   In \"The Tech Censors Return\" (Inside View, Dec. 12), Andy Kessler ends by joking that the Biden administration \"can ask Apple nicely to allow competing app stores,\" as opposed to watching Apple endure FTC lawsuits or be subject to legislation that forces the company's hand. </p><p>   Although Mr. Kessler advocates \"more freedom online,\" his article -- and even his joke -- doesn't offer market solutions. Consumers and entrepreneurs should ultimately be the ones driving Big Tech's conduct. If Apple crosses a line, consumers will switch to alternatives, and if it is profitable, entrepreneurs will mobilize capital to create even more options. If calls for alternative app stores become strong enough, Apple will have to acquiesce or risk losing market share. We ought to resist the urge to employ or threaten government coercion, which comes with risk. </p><p>   Benjamin Ayanian </p><p>   McLean, Va. </p><p></p>",
