  "text": "<p>The two-year search for a new chair of the Competition and Markets Authority will end later this month with the expected appointment of Clive Bannister, allowing the focus to switch to finding a successor for the UK competition watchdog's outgoing chief executive Andrea Coscelli. </p> <p>The government is set to announce Bannister, former chief of insurance company Phoenix Group, as the replacement to Andrew Tyrie — who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b48caaa5-a12d-42d8-98fd-38b71623843a\">was ousted in 2020</a> after a boardroom coup — according to several individuals with knowledge of the process. </p> <p>The protracted search for a new chair has led to further disruption at the top of the regulator by hampering the process to replace Coscelli, who <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-chief-executive-confirms-plan-to-step-down-in-july-2022\">announced</a> at the start of the year that he would step down in July. As a result, the government has opted to appoint an interim chief executive with Sarah Cardell, the CMA's general counsel, the leading candidate, according to these people.</p> <p>Officials are keen for the chief's role to be filled by a woman, and while the new chair will have a key role in the search, Cardell has strong internal backing to take the role permanently, according to the same people.</p> <p>The government is not expected to start the official search for a permanent chief until after the summer, however. </p> <p>The lack of orderly succession planning at the CMA comes at a crucial time as it expands its role in the wake of Brexit and the world's leading competition watchdogs seek to rein in big technology companies such as Facebook and Google. </p> <p>But there are other potential candidates, and those with knowledge of the process warned that Cardell's appointment was not certain given that the final decision rests with business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.</p> <p>Backers of Cardell see her appointment as a continuation of the aggressive stance Coscelli has taken against Big Tech with high-profile antitrust cases opened against Facebook, Apple and Google on his watch.</p> <p>But the change in leadership comes in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc4cc9d4-3ff8-49da-9279-2dba23b54ec0\">government U-turn</a> to empower the UK's new technology regulator, which is part of the CMA, by putting it on a statutory footing.</p> <p>Cardell, who was a partner at law firm Slaughter and May before joining regulator Ofgem, and then the CMA, is already being prepared for the top job, accompanying Coscelli at events including a recent trip to Silicon Valley. “She's across all files,” said a person who knows the way she operates.</p> <p>The announcement of the new chair is expected next week and although Bannister is the preferred candidate, one government official cautioned that Kwarteng had not yet made the final decision. </p> <p>The government declined to comment on the appointment of the CMA's new chair, but said it was “in the process” of recruiting a new chief executive and would “announce next steps in due course”. The CMA, Bannister and Cardell declined to comment.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jim Pickard</em></p><p>Source: Kate Beioley in London and Javier Espinoza in Brussels  2022 'UK competition watchdog to end 2-year search for new chair' FT.com 11 May.
