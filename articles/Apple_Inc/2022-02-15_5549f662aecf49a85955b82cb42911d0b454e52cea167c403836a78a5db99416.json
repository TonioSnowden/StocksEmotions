  "text": "<p>\"I made this money because the system is so bad, not because I'm a genius,\" the activist investor says in a new HBO documentary about his life and career.</p><p>Worth more than $16 billion from a lifetime of Wall Street fights, he says he has created over $1 trillion in stock gains for investors because decision makers aren't beholden to true democracy.</p><p>For more than 50 years, Mr. Icahn has been a central and polarizing figure in corporate America. \"Icahn: The Restless Billionaire\" premieres Tuesday, the eve of his 86th birthday. It shows Mr. Icahn aged but unbending in his views on what's wrong with corporations. He has spent his career browbeating chief executives and boards of directors to do his will, with a singular, unrelenting focus on boosting shareholder profit.</p><p>He says that produces more for everyone.</p><p>Some of today's global business leaders disagree. They say that focusing on shareholders over everyone else is the problem. Instead, they embrace stakeholder capitalism, which is a view that balancing the interests of shareholders with their employees and the broader community will make everyone better off.</p><p>Mr. Icahn is what's known as an activist investor who buys shares, sometimes relatively small positions, giving him influence and a cudgel in shareholder votes to push changes on board of directors.</p><p>His detractors say he pushes decisions that reward him while harming employees and leaving a battered company for others to clean up. It's partly a reaction to his lifetime of success that has helped spur the rise of stakeholder capitalism.</p><p>Mr. Icahn's career is one reason to question if this new mantra will be successful. He has had seemingly little trouble finding dozens of executives and boards who were failing at managing their businesses or their finances. Adding more interests to balance won't make the CEO's job easier or less susceptible to the activist investor industry Mr. Icahn pioneered.</p><p>The long arc of Mr. Icahn's career is already well known on Wall Street. For that crowd, the documentary gives a glimpse at Mr. Icahn's lifestyle and real estate, his family members, a snippet of his stand-up comedy routine (not suitable for a family newspaper) and details like what he served Tim Cook for dessert (a cookie emblazoned with the Apple logo missing an extra bite for Mr. Icahn.)</p><p>To those who may confuse him with Gordon Gekko, the documentary traces his rise from a poor kid in Queens to one of America's richest men. It explains Mr. Icahn's methods and philosophy through some of his greatest hits: from Texaco to Apple.</p><p>Even Mr. Gekko makes an appearance. Filmmaker Oliver Stone admits his fictional character was indeed channeling Mr. Icahn while lambasting the management of Teldar Paper in 1987's \"Wall Street,\" where he concludes greed is good.</p><p>\"He was telling us about the new way of doing things and how it was necessary to attack these companies because these are outdated companies and they don't take care of the shareholders,\" Mr. Stone recalls from meeting Mr. Icahn. \"Of course there is some truth to that but, nonetheless, Gordon Gekko is out for himself.\"</p><p>Those who say Mr. Icahn destroys companies inevitably point to TWA. Mr. Icahn bought the airline in 1985, trying to show he could run a business, not just criticize one.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Where do you place Carl Icahn in the history of business and investing? Join the conversation below.</p><p>TWA's flight attendants went on strike, grounding the airline over pay cuts that Mr. Icahn demanded. Picketers went to his gated home in Bedford, N.Y. He tried to talk to them but his attacks on their leaders were met with jeers. TWA ultimately went bankrupt on his watch, and he has battled unions ever since.</p><p>\"I made a lot of mistakes,\" he admits in the documentary. \"If it doesn't work then you blame yourself I guess.\"</p><p>Mr. Icahn agrees that his ideas have eliminated jobs, but he labels it \"creative destruction\" that forces companies to be better. Ultimately, he says, that boosts the economy.</p><p>Asked what drives him, Mr. Icahn tells the filmmakers it's about competition. He says his joy is in finding an investing idea that proves he is the best.</p><p>\"I think it's winning,\" he says. \"Just winning.\"</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Billionaire Carl Icahn Says He Isn't a Genius, Took Advantage of a Broken System</p>",
