  "title": "Elon Musk grabs Twitter, but how will he manage his growing empire? Elon Musk's decision to move forward with his purchase of Twitter sent the social media platform's stock skyrocketing, but has also raised questions about how the entrepreneur will manage his growing business empire.",
  "text": "<p>Andy Wu, assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School says that Musk has already been stretched thin and operating seemingly at his limits. \"In 2018, Musk said that he has already been working 120-hour weeks,\" he told MarketWatch. \"It would be hard, and some would think impossible, for Musk to maintain the level of attention he gives his existing businesses with Twitter now added to the portfolio.\"</p><p>Set against this backdrop, Musk will have to pull back his time and attention from somewhere, Wu added. \"He will have an even more complicated routine of switching his attention between companies with very lofty and divergent goals,\" the professor said.</p><p>See Now: Elon Musk wants to move forward with his purchase of Twitter. Here's how some Twitter users reacted.</p><p>For Eric Flamholtz, professor emeritus at UCLA's Anderson School of Management and president of Management Systems Consulting Corporation, Musk is a visionary whose success will depend on delegation. Musk, he says, should set up a special leadership team, or what he calls \"a leadership molecule\" in each of the companies.</p><p>\"It's usually, two, three or four people,\" he said, noting that each team spans vision and strategy, culture, day-to-day operations, the development of systems and processes, and innovation and change. \"They are overlapping circles,\" he added.</p><p>Flamholtz points to Warren Buffett as an example of someone who has successfully achieved \"positive laissez-faire leadership\" across businesses. \"If [Musk] husbands his resources, including himself, and his own energy, carefully, he can pull it off,\" Flamholtz said. \"He will fail if he's a micro-manager of everything.\"</p><p>But he sees a lot of positives in the Tesla and SpaceX CEO. \"Musk is in the style towards a Buffett,\" the academic added. \"He's not Buffett, but he's a variation on that theme.\"</p><p>See Now: Elon Musk would lose 13.5 million Twitter followers if he scraps most spam accounts; Justin Bieber would lose 27.6 million, data finds</p><p>Worries about CEOs managing multiple companies are nothing new. Former Twitter Inc. TWTR CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, prompted concerns that he was spread too thinly while running both the social media platform and payments company Square.</p><p>\"Dorsey is an interesting guy but his actions or inaction on Twitter suggest that he simply grew tired of the company or became more interested in Square,\" Charles King, principal analyst of tech research firm Pund-IT, told MarketWatch. \"Musk seems more engaged with his various enterprises but Twitter is a significantly different business than his other technology-driven ventures.\"</p><p>\"It isn't clear to me how or if Musk's considerable talents will successfully translate to a social media company,\" he added, noting that he could follow Buffett's model. \"But Musk's love of the limelight seems at odds with that approach.\"</p><p>Harvard's Wu sees a possible comparison with former Apple Inc. AAPL CEO, the late Steve Jobs, noting that, after his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs went on to found computer company NeXT while deeply involved in the development of animation studio Pixar.</p><p>See Now: Elon Musk says Twitter will eventually be part of 'X, the everything app'</p><p>While the diversified nature of Musk's companies is unlikely to create conflicts of interest, it could make it harder to pinpoint synergies for Musk's money and time, according to Wu.</p><p>Tesla shares were down 3.4% on Wednesday compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index's SPX fall of 0.2%. Twitter shares were down 1.2% on Wednesday, after gaining 22.2% on Tuesday.</p><p>So, would a scenario where Musk's attention is spread broadly alarm investors?</p><p>\"That seems likely,\" said King. \"The reaction of Tesla shareholders suggests that many would prefer a less mercurial, more sober executive.\"</p><p>\"Investors certainly have a reason to be concerned about Musk having his attention spread so thin across a fairly diverse set of companies,\" said Harvard's Wu. \"For example, many investors choose to invest in Tesla because they want Musk's involvement. Those investors could be concerned if it seems like Tesla is a lower priority for him than Twitter.\"</p><p>Opinion: Twitter stood up to Elon Musk and won, but will it feel like a win once he owns it?</p><p>However, Wu acknowledges that Musk's broad impact and diverse interests is a net positive for investors thanks to the \"cult of personality\" around him. \"One of the key ways that Musk adds value is empowering firms affiliated with him to raise money and buy themselves long and flexible timelines to implement big advancements,\" he said, noting that the Musk-founded Neuralink has raised more money than Amazon.com Inc. AMZN in all of its history.</p><p>Pund-IT's King will be watching carefully to see how Musk handles his latest challenge, particularly potential employee discontent at Twitter. \"It will be interesting to see who he places in leadership positions but more important will be who departs from Twitter,\" said King. \"Musk's spouting off on social media might seem amusing or charming from the outside but having to clean-up the resulting mess isn't an enviable position.\"</p><p>Earlier this year current and former Twitter employees told MarketWatch's Jon Swartz that Musk would likely decimate the platform's brand and reputation.</p><p>But UCLA Emeritus Professor Flamholtz sees Twitter as a good fit alongside the other companies in Musk's stable. \"Musk has basically created a cult around being Elon Musk,\" he said. \"What is Twitter? It's a vehicle for publicity.\"</p><p>See Now: Twitter employees blanch at prospect of Musk ownership</p><p>Twitter, he added, gives Musk a platform for visibility and helps him raise money.</p><p>One strategy for Musk would be to operate more like a private equity or venture capital executive, taking a fairly hands-off role and intervening only on high-level strategy decisions, according to Harvard's Wu.</p><p>\"That said, Musk doesn't seem to like being hands off,\" he added.</p><p>Elon Musk grabs Twitter, but how will he manage his growing empire?</p>",
