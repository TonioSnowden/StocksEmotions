  "title": "NatWest charged of money laundering offences by UK regulator",
  "text": "<p>The Financial Conduct Authority said it has begun criminal proceedings against NatWest over alleged money laundering offences — its first criminal prosecution of a bank under a 2007 law.</p> <p>The&#xa0;FCA&#xa0;alleges that “increasingly large cash deposits” were made to accounts operated by a UK incorporated customer of NatWest. Around £365m was paid into the customer's accounts, of which around £264m was in cash, the regulator said in a statement, adding: “It is alleged that NatWest's systems and controls failed to adequately monitor and scrutinise this activity.” &#xa0;</p> <p>The regulations introduced 14 years ago require a firm to determine, conduct and demonstrate risk-sensitive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of its relationships with its customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering, the FCA said.</p> <p>NatWest is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on April 14.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Greggs</strong> reported its first ever annual loss as travel restrictions and store closures in Scotland meant sales plunged 30.4 per cent. The bakery chain reported a pre-tax loss of £13.7m on sales of £811.3m for 2020. It said recent trading had been better than expected, taking lockdowns into account, with like-for-like sales down 28.8 per cent in the first ten weeks of 2021. </p> <p><strong>Ferguson</strong>, the plumbing and heating merchant, announced a $400m special dividend post the recent disposal of its UK business and launched a share buyback for the same amount. Half-year underlying trading profit grew to $837m from a restated $746m a year earlier, the group said. Management said the outlook for the second half remained very uncertain but gave a cautiously optimistic outlook on residential end-markets and guided for high single-digit organic sales growth. </p> <p><strong>Close Brothers</strong> said 2020 adjusted operating profit was up 2 per cent to £128.5m. It reported “new business volumes in the lending business, solid net inflows in asset management and a very strong trading performance in Winterflood, with income growth in all three divisions.” Operating profit at the asset manager's Winterflood broking division surged 223 per cent to £34.2m as heightened trading volumes meant no loss days.</p> <p>Financial markets bookmaker <strong>Plus500</strong> said first-quarter trading has remained strong with customer income tracking ahead of fourth-quarter levels. </p> <p><strong>Trustpilot</strong> targeted a valuation of up to £1bn with its planned flotation in London. The online reviews platform set a range of 250p to 265p on its float. It plans to raise £47m through the sale of new shares and cash out approximately £387m for current holders, giving the company a free float of just over 50 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Computacenter</strong> reported a 46.5 per cent jump in full year pre-tax profit to £206.6m. The IT services group said its 2020 performance exceeded all expectations and that 2021 had begun vey positively.</p> <p><strong>John Wood</strong>, the oil services company, skipped its 2020 final dividend but said momentum in contract awards had improved late in the fourth quarter. It reported a 26.3 per cent drop in underlying operating earnings to $630m.</p> <p>Corporate merchandise maker <strong>4imprint</strong> reported a 92 per cent slump in underlying pre-tax profit to $4.37m for 2020. This year's January and February orders had been just 65 per cent of 2019 levels, “reflecting typically lower order activity at the start of the year combined with volatility caused by news flow and weather events in our primary US market,” the company said.</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>St James's Place</strong> said Baroness Helena Morrissey is quitting its board after just 14 months to chair rival money manager <strong>AJ Bell</strong>. Morrissey will be appointed a non-executive director and chair designate of AJ Bell from July and will step down from St James's Place at its forthcoming annual general meeting to avoid any potential conflict of interest, St James's Place said. At press time there was no announcement from AJ Bell on the appointment. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Some of China's biggest technology companies, including ByteDance and Tencent, are testing a tool to bypass <strong>Apple's</strong> new privacy rules and continue tracking iPhone users without their consent to serve them targeted mobile advertisements. Apple is expected to update its smartphones in the coming weeks so that applications that want to gather tracking data will have to ask users for permission. In response, the state-backed China Advertising Association, which has 2,000 members, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/520ccdae-202f-45f9-a516-5cbe08361c34\">launched a new way to track and identify</a> iPhone users called CAID, which is being widely tested by tech companies and advertisers in the country.</p> <p><strong>News Corp</strong> has struck <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3743eba8-dc91-47f8-add1-f2f9626f75dc\">a three-year deal</a> to provide news to <strong>Facebook</strong> in Australia, ending a battle between two billionaire-owned empires being watched worldwide as a possible template for regulating Big Tech. The deal includes content from The Australian newspaper, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph and the Melbourne-based Herald Sun as well as regional publications, News Corp said in a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/\">statement</a>. The pay television channel Sky News Australia has reached a parallel deal, it added.</p> <p>The <strong>Sackler family</strong> members who own Purdue Pharma, the drugmaker blamed for fuelling the US opioid crisis, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/341d39aa-7eb7-4f5c-8f38-dd48471093fc\">have increased the amount of cash</a> they would contribute to a potential bankruptcy settlement to $4.3bn in an attempt to win over states that rejected the deal. Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the OxyContin maker was hit with thousands of lawsuits from states, towns and cities across the US, which have become the main creditors in any bankruptcy settlement.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian <br></strong>A healthy pause that refreshes or a warning sign of a much more consequential dip down the road? This is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e31952b-2b51-4125-a182-477b445602e5\">the question on investors' minds</a> as markets recover from an early-year dip.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Provident's threat to put its home collection business into administration or liquidation looks rather like the type of strong-arm tactics it claims to be saving customers from in the unregulated part of the credit markets.<br><br></p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
