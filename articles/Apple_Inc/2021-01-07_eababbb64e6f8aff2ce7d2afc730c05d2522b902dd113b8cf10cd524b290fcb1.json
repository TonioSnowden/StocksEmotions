  "title": "Chaos in the Capitol:  Corporate Leaders Denounce Unrest  ----  By Emily Glazer, Chip Cutter and Lauren Weber",
  "text": "<p>   Business leaders and trade groups called for an end to the violence in Washington on Wednesday as supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol where legislators were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win. </p><p>   The comments came during a week of statements and meetings involving corporate executives as they sought to publicly urge a smooth transfer of power while Mr. Trump disputed his election defeat. </p><p>   Chief executives, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Bank of America Corp., condemned the violence. </p><p>   \"The insurrection that followed the president's remarks today is appalling and an affront to the democratic values we hold dear as Americans,\" said Blackstone Group Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal allies on Wall Street and a major Republican fundraiser. Mr. Schwarzman added that \"there must be a peaceful transition of power.\" </p><p>    James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the country's largest bank, said the violence doesn't represent the U.S. \"Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power,\" Mr. Dimon said. </p><p>    Apple CEO Tim Cook called for those responsible to be held to account. \"It's especially when they are challenged that our ideals matter most,\" he tweeted. </p><p>    Larry Fink, head of asset management giant BlackRock Inc., called the violence \"an assault on our nation, our democracy, and the will of the American people.\" Brad Karp, chairman of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP, said Mr. Trump was aided by a \"complicit group of senators and congressmen\" to undermine democracy. </p><p>   Others in the business community called for further steps. Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said Vice President Mike Pence should consider invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power when a president is unable to fulfill his duties. </p><p>   \"This is not the vision of America that manufacturers believe in and work so hard to defend,\" Mr. Timmons said. \"Across America today, millions of manufacturing workers are helping our nation fight the deadly pandemic that has already taken hundreds of thousands of lives. We are trying to rebuild an economy and save and rebuild lives. But none of that will matter if our leaders refuse to fend off this attack on America and our democracy.\" </p><p></p>",
