  "text": "<p>Some of us are drawn to ambitious New Year's resolutions. Pogo stick from Maine to San Diego; finish an 80,000-piece puzzle of chameleons playing poker; unmask a trove of secret government records showing Elvis is alive and running a combination Jet Ski/poke bowl shack in Islamorada.</p><p>If you read my New Year's column last year, you know I prefer a modest resolution, with a lower barrier to entry. Here's a fresh list of humble resolutions for 2023:</p><p>1. I am going to see a moose. I resolved to see a moose in 2022, and I got a LOT of great recommendations from Journal readers about where to see a moose, but I'm embarrassed to say: I didn't put a lot of effort into moosing. I went 0 for moose. I saw the Vikings come back from 33-0. I need a moose.</p><p>2. I am going to play considerably less polo. I currently play zero polo, and have never played polo in my entire life, so I figure this resolution will be easy to hit.</p><p>3. I'm going to read at least one of the magazines that gets delivered to the house. We subscribe to several quality publications, but there's always a point when I look down at the coffee table and see a BEST DOCTORS cover story, pick it up, and discover they're the BEST DOCTORS of 1998.</p><p>4. I'm going to stop asking people from Denver about the Broncos.</p><p>5. When someone asks me if I've seen the hot TV show, I'm just going to nod my head vigorously and say \"Yes!\" and run away before they ask me about anything else.</p><p>6. I am going to think about repairing the cabinet door under the sink. I said think about it. Not do it.</p><p>7. I'm going to figure out what Minercraft is, and why my children live in it.</p><p>8. Minecraft, sorry. Calm down.</p><p>9. I'm going to get a phone charger and hide it from everyone in my family. If someone says \"Hey do we have any chargers around here for the iPad?\" I'm just going to sit on the couch and keep my mouth shut.</p><p>10. I'm going to let the children cook me dinner. I may need to contact a Best Doctor after this.</p><p>11. I would resolve to spend less time talking to the cat, but honestly, the cat is the only one in the house who listens to me.</p><p>12. I'm going to practice deep empathy and never speak ill of anyone, except for ____________, _____________, ____________ and ___________. Also: ___________, because they're really the pits.</p><p>13. I am going to mail a letter. Notice I did not say \"I'm going to start mailing letters,\" as if I'm suddenly in an old Victorian novel. I mean I will mail one letter. I told you: these are modest resolutions.</p><p>14. I'm going to try and steal a car from Dan Neil again. Last year I tried to steal a McLaren that turned out to belong to Dan's neighbor, and let me tell you: the neighbor was not pleased with me.</p><p>15. I am going to try and take the garbage out before I hear the truck barreling down the street and run out in my bare feet and yelling \"Waittttt! Waiiiiit!\"</p><p>16. I'm going to spend more time proofreading I column.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's a New Year's resolution you might keep in 2023? Join the conversation below.</p><p>17. I'm going to stop yawning loudly when anyone brings up Michigan football.</p><p>18. YAWN.</p><p>19. This is the year I'm finally going to learn about wine. Oh, who am I kidding. I'll have the house red, Pizza Hut.</p><p>20. I'm going to finish an 80-piece puzzle of chameleons playing poker.</p><p>21. I'm going to pogo stick from Maine to San Diego. What else do I have going on?</p><p>22. If nothing else, moose.</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>More New Year's Resolutions You Can Actually Keep</p>",
