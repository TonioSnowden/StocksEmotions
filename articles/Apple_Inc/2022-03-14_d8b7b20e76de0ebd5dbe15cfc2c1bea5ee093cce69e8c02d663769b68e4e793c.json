  "title": "Discovery CEO Received $246 Million in Compensation in 2021, Including Big Options Grant; David Zaslav's compensation is the largest CEO pay package reported by an S&P 500 company so far this year",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Zaslav's salary was flat at $3 million. The increase in compensation stems largely from a massive grant of stock options on the eve of last year's announcement Discovery's plans to merge with AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia.</p><p>Given the strike prices of the options granted to Mr. Zaslav, Discovery's share price would have to rise considerably for those options to be in the money.</p><p>He also received a $4.4 million discretionary cash bonus, which Discovery said in a filing earlier this month was for his leadership through the Covid-19 pandemic, growing the company's Discovery+ streaming service and his efforts last year to negotiate the merger with WarnerMedia.</p><p>After Mr. Zaslav, the next highest-paid CEO is Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook, who received total compensation of about $99 million in 2021, according to a securities filing from Apple.</p><p>Around the time of the merger last year, Mr. Zaslav signed a new contract that runs through 2027, according to the filing. The contract gives Mr. Zaslav a car allowance of $1,400 a month and access to Discovery's corporate jet, the filing shows.</p><p>Discovery is planning to merge with WarnerMedia, whose assets include Warner Bros., CNN and the HBO Max streaming service, in the second quarter. AT&amp;T shareholders are in line to get a roughly 71% stake in the entertainment company, which will be called Warner Bros. Discovery.</p><p>Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com and Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com</p><p>Discovery CEO Received $246 Million in Compensation in 2021, Including Big Options Grant</p>",
