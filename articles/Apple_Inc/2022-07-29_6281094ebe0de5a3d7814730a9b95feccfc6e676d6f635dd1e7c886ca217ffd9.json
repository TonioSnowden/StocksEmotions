  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Stocks Rise, Extending Post-Fed Gains  ----  By Will Horner and Gunjan Banerji",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks climbed Thursday, despite fresh data showing the U.S. economy contracted for a second straight quarter. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 added 48.82 points, or 1.2%, to 4072.43, building on its strong gains from the prior session. The broad market index closed sharply higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the pace of rate rises would eventually slow. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 332.04 points, or 1%, to 32529.63. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 130.17 points, or 1.1%, to 12162.59. </p><p>   The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.9% annual rate last quarter, marking a second straight quarterly decline in gross domestic product, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The data intensified debate among analysts and investors about whether the economy is in a recession. </p><p>   Stocks have started the third quarter in better form after the declines suffered in the first half of the year. Corporate earnings haven't been as bad as investors had feared, suggesting that soaring inflation and signs of flagging economic growth aren't weighing too heavily on companies' balance sheets. </p><p>   All three major indexes have risen at least 8% from their 2022 lows in mid-June and are headed toward strong monthly gains. </p><p>   The Federal Reserve has signaled it is serious about bringing inflation down. On Wednesday it raised its federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%.Some traders have ramped up bets on a slower pace of interest rate increases in coming months after the meeting, helping propel the stock-market rally. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell for the third consecutive session to 2.680% from 2.731% on Wednesday. The yield on the 2-year note dropped to 2.874% from 2.968%. </p><p>   Despite recent gains for the major stock indexes, some investors remain concerned about stretched valuations and the pace of Fed rate rises. </p><p>   \"The rally we have seen looks like a classic bear market rally, rather than the launch of a new bull market,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"We are still going to have a period where inflation is uncomfortably high and growth is uncomfortably low, and that is not a good backdrop.\" </p><p>   Investors have been looking to earnings results from major blue-chip and technology companies for further guidance about the state of the economy. </p><p>   After markets closed, Amazon.com reported another quarterly loss but said it is making progress controlling costs, pushing its shares up 12% in late trading. Apple shares rose 2.8% after the company reported iPhone sales continued to grow despite the economic headwinds. But Intel slumped 8.9% after posting a surprise quarterly loss and cutting its outlook amid a slump in personal-computer purchases and product delays. </p><p>   In other corporate news, shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms fell $8.86, or 5.2%, to $160.72 after it reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue. Qualcomm dropped $6.97, or 4.5%, to $146.45 after issuing a muted sales outlook. </p><p>   Ford jumped 81 cents, or 6.1%, to $14 after reporting a 50% rise in revenue. </p><p>   Spirit Airlines climbed $1.36, or 5.6%, to $25.66 after JetBlue Airways agreed to buy the carrier. JetBlue dropped 3 cents, or 0.4%, to $8.37. </p><p>   In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.5% to $107.14 a barrel. Gold prices gained 1.8%. </p><p>   European indexes were broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.1%. At midday Friday in Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.5%, while in China the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.3%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong had fallen 1.2%. </p><p></p>",
