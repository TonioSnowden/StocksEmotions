  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Small Businesses Vary, and  Their Taxation Should Fit",
  "text": "<p>   In \"A Biden Tax-Hike Break For Small Businesses\" (op-ed, Jan. 21), Ed Finn proposes that small businesses earning under $2.5 million a year should see no tax increase, but all companies earning above that number should be taxed at the full corporate rate, and the same should apply to subchapter S companies. This is far too simplistic. There are very small, small, medium, large and huge companies. Huge companies often have huge competitive advantages, especially over medium-size companies. If there is to be a difference in tax rates, they should be graduated like personal rates. A company earning $10 million a year and employing 400 employees should not be taxed at the same rate as Apple or Facebook. </p><p>   Joel Myers </p><p>    Founder &amp; CEO </p><p>   AccuWeather </p><p>   State College, Pa. </p><p></p>",
