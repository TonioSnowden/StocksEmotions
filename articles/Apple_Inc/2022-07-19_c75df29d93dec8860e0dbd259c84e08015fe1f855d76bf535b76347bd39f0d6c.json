  "title": "The 2022 Kia K5 vs. the Honda Civic—which is better? They are both high-value, feature-packed, fun-to-drive cars; it may come down to power and price.",
  "text": "<p>Brand-new in 2021 as a replacement for the Optima, the 2022 K5 remains a strong competitor in the midsize sedan segment. A sporty midsize sedan with a fastback look, the 2022 Kia KR:000270 K5 offers technology, comfort, and great driving manners in a handsome package.</p><p>Kia K5 highlights</p><p>Sharp styling: We love the sharp looks of the outside, particularly the headlights and the fastback styling. The interior is a very nice place to be, with seats that are both comfortable and supportive, and a futuristic-looking instrument panel and infotainment system. A higher trim called the GT-Line adds some sporty looks and 18-inch wheels. Most interior functions are accessed via the infotainment screen, or redundant buttons on the steering wheel, making the cabin neat and tidy.</p><p>Value pricing: The K5 is pricier than the smaller Civic, but it's a strong value among midsize sedans. Apple AAPL CarPlay, Android Auto and dual-zone automatic climate control are standard, as is automatic emergency braking. Standard safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist, and automatic high beams. Upper trims offer all-wheel drive, more USB ports, a larger touchscreen, heated seats, navigation, and a panoramic sunroof. The K5 also offers available all-wheel drive, which isn't available on the Civic.</p><p>Good fuel economy: The base 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder might seem small, but it provides plenty of low-end torque to keep the K5 moving. The 8-speed transmission helps it earn good fuel economy, while a driver-selectable Sport mode adds driving fun. It's not as efficient as the smaller and less powerful Civic, but its combined EPA rating of 31 mpg is solid for a midsize sedan.</p><p>Also read: No matter your age, here's how to tell if your finances are on the right track</p><p>2022 Honda Civic</p><p>As KBB's Compact Car Best Buy for 2022, the totally redesigned Honda Civic continues to impress with its value, style, and performance. Shoppers are impressed, too, as it's the top-selling passenger car in the U.S.</p><p>Honda Civic highlights</p><p>Timeless design: Honda's HMC \"timeless design\" concepts from previous Civics have been revisited here, including a low hood, front fenders, and beltline, which create an expansive greenhouse and a superb outward view. While the new Civic hatchback could have been made to look more like a wagon, Honda instead gave it a coupe-like roofline while retaining good rear headroom.</p><p>Read: 10 top hybrids for less than $30,000</p><p>Impeccably practical yet fun: Despite being even more efficient than previous Civics, the 2022 model also continues the tradition of being fun to drive, offering 158 horsepower and a suspension tuned for fun as well as everyday comfort. Add in the Civic's roomy interior and solid fuel economy ratings of up to 36 mpg combined and you have a fun and relatively frugal — and still affordable — pick for the daily grind.</p><p>Refined and reliable: Just as it's fun and good-looking, the 2022 Civic also exhibits the best of Honda's ability to deliver exceptional refinement, reliability, and resale value in a relatively affordable package.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Fun to drive; strong tech; excellent interiors.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>You really can't go wrong choosing either of these high-value, feature-packed, fun-to-drive cars. The Civic is as good as it gets among compact cars, but as a midsize sedan the K5 offers more room, more power, and more features, but for a bit more money.</p><p>Also see: How does this car seem to run on almost nothing?
