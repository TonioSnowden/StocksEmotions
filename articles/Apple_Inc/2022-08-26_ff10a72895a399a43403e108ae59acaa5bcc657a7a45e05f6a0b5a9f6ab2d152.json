While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.\"</p><p>Jake Jolly, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said Powell's remarks solidified his stay-tough stance.</p><p>\"The market was pretty clearly set up for a hawkish 'sticking to the script' type of speech and the initial impression is that was what Chair Powell delivered â€” and he did in in less than 10 minutes,\" Jolly said.</p><p>\"The key takeaway is he closed the door on this idea that there is going to be a short-term pivot on Fed policy.\"</p><p>Read: How stocks perform as central bankers gather each year at Jackson Hole</p><p>As Wall Street's selloff accelerated, Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the CBOE Volatility Index VIX was up 1.3%, after climbing as high as 9.4% to 23.82.
