The range is about average, however, and the rear can be tight for more than two adults.</p><p>i4 vs. 2: Electric Evolution</p><p>BMW i4</p><p>Brand-new this year, the 2022 BMW i4 is an impressive effort among electric sport sedans. There are two options. The base is rear-wheel drive, with 335 horsepower and 300 miles of range, whereas the all-wheel-drive i4 M50 has 536 hp and 240 miles of range. Yes, that's right. An electric car from BMW's M division. Both are plenty quick, and a near 50/50 weight distribution and a low center of gravity make the i4 handle exceptionally well.</p><p>The i4 offers one-pedal driving. All you need to do to slow or come to a full stop is ease your foot off or remove it abruptly. The pedal is very sensitive, though, so smooth driving takes a bit of practice.</p><p>The interior is clean and simple, with a steering wheel that is refreshingly devoid of too many buttons or switches. Headroom is abundant, although rear legroom is tight when the front seats are all the way back. Infotainment is handled via a 14.9-inch touchscreen, alongside a 12.3-inch driver information display.</p><p>Standard features include simulated leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats, Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto, a 10-speaker/205-watt audio system, and navigation. Standard safety features include forward-collision warning with automatic braking, lane-departure warning, and both front and rear parking sensors.</p><p>Read:Your complete guide to MPGe, the electric equivalent of miles per gallon</p><p>Predictably, higher trims get loads of upgrades. Among them are leather upholstery, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system, and a parking assistant with a 360-degree camera. For driving enthusiasts, a Dynamic Handling package, an M Sport package, and high-performance tires are all available.</p><p>With a fast charger, either i4 can add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes. A full charge takes just under 8 hours.</p><p>Polestar 2</p><p>While the name Polestar is likely unfamiliar to most, the 2022 Polestar 2 comes from the Volvo Group VLVLY, and its underpinnings are fairly recognizable. A bit of a tweener, the Polestar 2 looks like a mashup of Volvo's XC40 crossover and S90 sedan, except it's fully electric.</p><p>A new entry-level Polestar 2 starts at $45,900 and includes a single 231-horsepower motor that powers the front wheels. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Polestar costs $4,000 more and makes 408 hp and 487 lb-ft of torque. It's quick, with great thrust when you need it and good handling through the curves. The thick rear pillars impede rear visibility, so make sure you use your mirrors and the blind-spot monitoring system.</p><p>The more powerful Polestar 2 has 249 miles of range, while the single-motor model has 265 miles. Charging takes about 7 hours, although the company says a recharge can happen in 40 minutes with DC charging. The dual-motor Polestar 2 can tow up to 2,000 pounds when properly equipped.</p><p>The interior is straight out of the Scandinavian playbook, both elegant and simple. Most controls are on the 11-inch vertical touchscreen, with a few redundant switches on the steering wheel. Front and rear seats are heated and made of a vegan-friendly fabric, with good bolsters.</p><p>Check out: The new 2023 Toyota BZ4X: An electric SUV with a sci-fi vibe</p><p>Standard features include four USB ports, wireless phone charging, satellite radio, and a 360-degree camera. Infotainment uses Android, with Google GOOGL Assistant, Google Maps, and the Google Play store. Safety features include forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Polestar says Apple CarPlay integration will be available in spring of 2022.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Optional upgrade motor; warranty; tax credit eligibility; optional single-pedal driving.</p><p>2022 BMW i4 advantages</p><p>Range; excellent handling; sporty look.</p><p>2022 Polestar 2 advantages</p><p>Charging time; starting price; cargo space.</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>If you want the sharp handling, communicative steering, and crisp styling of the BMW 4 Series but in an EV, the 2022 BMW i4 is a natural choice. It is not only fun to drive but comfortable, and the M50 may just make you forget you're driving an EV.</p><p>Read: Should you get an electric car? Here are some pros and cons</p><p>As expected from a Volvo spinoff, the 2022 Polestar 2 has a clean interior design and the practicality of a hatchback. It's still fun to drive, with plenty of power from either the base motor or the upgrade dual-motor system and good range for daily driving.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2022 BMW i4                         2022 Polestar 2  Popular Powertrains  Electric Motor         250 kW current excited synchronous  300 kW AC synchronous  Horsepower             355 hp                              408 hp  Torque                 327 lb-ft                           487 lb-ft  EPA Driving Range      300 miles                           249 miles  EPA Fuel Economy       76 city/78 hwy MPGe                 96 city/88 hwy MPGe  Level 2 Charging Time  8 hours                             7 hours  Battery pack           81 kWh Li-ion; 288 cells            78 kWh Li-ion; 324 cells  Specs  Warranty               4 years/50,000 miles                4 years/50,000 miles  Battery warranty       8 years/100,000 miles               8 years/100,000 miles  NHTSA Safety Rating    n/a                                 n/a  Max Seating Capacity   5                                   5  Wheelbase              112.4 inches                        107.7 inches  Overall Length         188.3 inches                        181.3 inches  Width                  72.9 inches                         73.2 inches  Height                 57.0 inches                         65.5 inches  Turning Diameter       41.0 feet                           40.0 feet  Headroom, Front        38.2 inches                         39.5 inches  Headroom, Rear         36.6 inches                         37.0 inches  Legroom, Front         42.5 inches                         42.2 inches  Legroom, Rear          34.2 inches                         33.9 inches  Shoulder Room, Front   55.2 inches                         53.7 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear    54.3 inches                         53.3 inches  EPA Passenger Volume   n/a                                 89 cubic feet  Cargo Volume           10 cubic feet                       15.2/37.2 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
