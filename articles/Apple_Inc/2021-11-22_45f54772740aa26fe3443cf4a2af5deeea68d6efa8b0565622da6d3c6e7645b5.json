  "text": "<p>Anyone in search of a bespoke suit in the late 1960s would have found London's Savile Row a daunting prospect. “Dead, intimidating, forbidding,” is how Edward Sexton, the veteran tailor, recalls it.</p> <p>The clenched atmosphere of the fine tailors' shops on the street that dressed the English upper classes was intended to keep out the hoi polloi. “Heavy oak doors, curtains, no window displays, nothing to attract passing trade,” he says.</p> <p>Sexton, a skilled pattern-cutter who trained in east London, was still in his twenties when in February 1969 he and Tommy Nutter, a young working-class London tailor, opened Nutters of Savile Row at number 35a. Theirs was an upstart establishment in Mayfair, intended to subvert a stuffy world by offering fine men's tailoring with exaggerated, dandyish form and colour (Sexton's ready-to-wear shop still trades at number 34). </p> <p>Like Sexton and Nutter, many of their clients were young, working class and had made enough money in the creative industries to afford handmade clothes, loud enough to announce their arrival. “Suddenly young people were making a hell of a lot of money, and that had not happened before,” says Paolo Hewitt, author of <em>Fab Gear: The Beatles and Fashion</em>.</p> <p>To the established tailors of Savile Row, Sexton and Nutter's presence must have felt like an ambush. Six months earlier, the Beatles had moved the headquarters of Apple Corps, their business empire, to number 3. The Beatles were among Nutter's first clients: all except a denim-clad George Harrison wear Nutter's suits on the cover of <em>Abbey Road</em>, their 1969 album. “That was a stroke of luck,” recalls Sexton. “It wasn't an organised photo shoot.” Very quickly, they started to see clients not only from the counterculture but also businessmen. </p> <p>The Beatles' fashion influence is again in the spotlight with <em>The Beatles: Get Back,</em> the three-part television documentary directed and produced by Peter Jackson, which makes its worldwide debut on Disney+ this week. The film is made up of previously unseen footage of the January 1969 recording of the studio album <em>Let It Be</em> and the band's final live performance on the Apple Corps rooftop at Savile Row that month — one of few times the Beatles performed out of uniform, according to Hewitt. </p> <p>The documentary captures the Beatles' creative process in the months before they split. But just as striking is what John, Paul, George and Ringo are wearing in that footage from early 1969, which is shown in the documentary's trailer. Their relaxed, joyfully effeminate garb is nothing like the modernist uniform suits, often by Pierre Cardin, which they wore in the period between 1963 and 1966, from their early success to when they withdrew from live performances.</p> <p>In <em>Get Back,</em> Ringo Starr — the most sartorially confident Beatle — wears a succession of flouncy blouses in hallucinatory patterns, John Lennon favours primary colours and his future wife's fur coat, George Harrison appears in an array of English Edwardian-style pastel tailoring, while Paul McCartney wears tangerine knitwear. It is a visual riot that&#xa0;reflects not only the band's creative position, but also a wider social and cultural upheaval. </p> <p>“That period at the end of the decade becomes very intense in London,” says Teresa Collenette, fashion historian and co-curator of the exhibition <em>Beautiful People: The Boutique in 1960s Counterculture</em>, currently on show at London's Fashion and Textile Museum. Fashion, she says, changed faster than ever before.</p> <p>“Early in the 1960s it's about the future and mass manufacture. But later the mood changes with the escalation of the Vietnam war, a move towards rejecting modernity, looking backwards, anti-materialism and an interest in a multicultural future.”</p> <p>The cultural commentator and jazz musician George Melly had identified these sartorial shifts as early as 1966, when he noticed exaggerated costumes worn by gallery-goers at an exhibition of the work of Aubrey Beardsley, the Victorian illustrator, at the V&amp;A. “I found them impossible to place,” Melly wrote in the Observer. “Almost all of them gave the impression of belonging to a secret society which had not yet declared its aims or intentions. I believe now . . . that I had stumbled for the first time into the presence of the emerging Underground.”</p> <p>Nutters of Savile Row was not the only shop from which the Beatles bought their clothes. Their style was shaped by a range of designers and emporiums, including several west London boutiques, which Collenette describes as “almost anti-shops” because their outlandish garments were wildly impractical: Hung on You, Granny Takes a Trip and I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet among them. </p> <p>In 1967 the Beatles had even ventured into retail themselves, first with the Apple Boutique on Baker Street, and later with the shortlived Apple Tailoring on the King's Road in Chelsea. The former carried expensive clothing in lavish materials by an elusive Dutch design duo, known as The Fool. Simon Posthuma and Marijke Koger were artists rather than clothes designers, and the venture lasted little more than six months.</p> <p>“That was a weird, stylised medieval aesthetic,” says Collenette. “It was a shortlived shop that lost a lot of money. There wasn't much business sense, and there was a lot of shoplifting. But [the Beatles] were caught in an intense moment, and the class barriers were down. It was a creative project and as soon as it became a bit boring they lost interest.”</p> <p>According to Hewitt, the band's late-period experimental clothing reflects another awakening: “They were trying to move away from tough, working-class macho Liverpool,” he says.</p> <p>“There's a bit [in <em>Get Back</em>] where Lennon's got on a green shirt, probably a Ben Sherman, which in 1969 was worn by skinheads. But he's got long hair. He's mixing it. One of the great things about the Beatles was their wide-ranging music, and they did the same in clothes. That same jumbling up of all kinds of styles.”</p> <p>The Beatles split in August 1969, just months after the recording of <em>Get Back</em>. The band argued over musical direction, and their lack of a uniform style reflects those tensions: “It signifies the move towards the break-up,” says Hewitt. </p> <p>But that brief, late-career sartorial explosion reflected a wider shift that changed London's fine tailoring industry forever. It was also part of what made the Beatles special, says Collenette: “From a fashion history point of view, they were exceptional.”</p> <p><em>‘The Beatles: Get Back' premieres on Disney Plus on November 25-27 with the book of the series published by Callaway.
