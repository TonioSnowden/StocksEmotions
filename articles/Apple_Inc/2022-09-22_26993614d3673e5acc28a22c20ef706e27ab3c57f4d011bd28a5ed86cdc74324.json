  "text": "<p>   Ted Lasso is heading to a premier league -- at least in a videogame. </p><p>   The fictional character, portrayed on the hit Apple TV+ show by Jason Sudeikis, will be playable in \"FIFA 23,\" the latest version of the long-running soccer videogame being released Sept. 30, Electronic Arts Inc. said Wednesday. </p><p>   The videogame franchise features the world's most popular soccer teams through licenses with the Premier League, Bundesliga and other leagues. </p><p>   \"FIFA 23\" adds AFC Richmond, the fictional team Ted Lasso manages in the show, as well as the fictional place the team plays: Nelson Road Stadium. Other characters from the show will also be in the game, including Roy Kent, a potty-mouthed footballer played by Brett Goldstein. </p><p>   This installment of the game will be the last to carry FIFA in the title, as EA's partnership with soccer's governing body ends. </p><p></p>",
