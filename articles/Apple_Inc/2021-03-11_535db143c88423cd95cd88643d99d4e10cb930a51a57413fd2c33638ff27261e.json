  "title": "Wednesday's Markets:  Dow Closes Above 32000 for First Time  ---  Low inflation data  ease concerns about  higher interest rates;  Nasdaq falls slightly  ----  By Will Horner and Paul Vigna",
  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 450 points to a record close after fresh inflation data showed a muted increase and eased fears of a rapid rise in interest rates. </p><p>   The blue-chip index jumped 464.28 points, or 1.5%, to 32297.02, marking its 11th record of 2021 and first close above 32000. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 gained 23.37 points, or 0.6%, to 3898.81. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 4.99 points, or less than 0.1%, to 13068.83, after rising more than 1.5% in morning trading on the back of Tuesday's rally. </p><p>   The gains for Dow stocks and losses for momentum-driven tech stocks are becoming a familiar pattern. Markets have seesawed in the past few weeks as investors have watched yields on U.S. government debt surge amid expectations of both higher inflation and an economic recovery. </p><p>   Those higher yields have narrowed the relative valuation gap between safer bonds and riskier stocks and made bond returns more attractive to some investors. </p><p>   \"We have seen a genuine rotation from growth to value,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. \"The companies that were laggards before, like financials and energy, have ruled the roost lately.\" </p><p>   Since the pandemic started last year, investors have discounted some economic data in favor of betting on an expected rebound. Now, though, those looking ahead are watching for signs of inflation and changes in monetary policy, said ThinkMarkets analyst Fawad Razaqzada. </p><p>   \"People will be expecting bond yields to edge higher,\" he said. \"The potential gains in U.S. stocks are going to be limited from here.\" </p><p>   The consumer-price index rose 0.4% last month, in line with expectations. That helped assuage concerns that a sharp increase in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.520% from 1.545% on Tuesday. This year's steep rise in yields, which had fallen as low as 0.915% at the start of 2021, partly reflects expectations that the Fed will boost short-term interest rates. </p><p>   That is because improved economic prospects are fueling bets on sectors such as banking and energy that would benefit from a rebound, and away from the technology stocks that rallied during Covid-19 lockdowns last year. That has given a boost to the Dow industrials, which have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year. </p><p>   On Wednesday, the best sectors in the S&amp;P 500 were energy, up 2.6%, financials, up 1.9%, and materials, up 1.6%. Tech was the only sector to drop, losing 0.4%. </p><p>   Among individual stocks, Tesla slipped $5.52, or 0.8%, to $668.06, Amazon.com lost $5.21, or 0.2%, to $3,057.64, and Apple fell $1.10, or 0.9% to $119.98. </p><p>    General Electric fell 75 cents, or 5.4%, to $13.25 after agreeing to combine its jet-leasing unit with rival AerCap and shut down its GE Capital unit. </p><p>    GameStop, a favorite of day traders, rose $18.10, or 7.3%, to $265, paring earlier gains of more than 40%. </p><p>   The U.S. government auctioned $38 billion in 10-year Treasury notes. Demand for the 10-year note was in line with recent auctions, with $2.38 of bids for every dollar of Treasurys sold. There were fears that demand would be weaker. </p><p>   Federal Reserve officials have said they would allow inflation to exceed 2% for a spell before tightening policy. That might take longer than many investors are anticipating, said Willem Sels, chief investment officer at HSBC Private Bank. </p><p>   \"Inflation is still capped by the fact that the demand is still relatively weak in a lot of sectors,\" he said. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.4%. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.5% and the Shanghai Composite was up 2%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.4%. </p><p></p>",
