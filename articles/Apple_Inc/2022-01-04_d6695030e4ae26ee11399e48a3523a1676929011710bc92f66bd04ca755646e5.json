  "text": "<p>Traders sold US Treasuries and shares in companies that have been boosted by pandemic lockdowns on Tuesday as market jitters about the Omicron variant eased and investors bet on tighter monetary policy. </p> <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond, which moves inversely to the price of the government debt, rose 0.02 percentage points to 1.65 per cent after climbing sharply on Monday. </p> <p>The sell-off pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury to its highest level since late November, when the World Health Organization declared the Omicron coronavirus a variant of concern. </p> <p>Investors and strategists said the move in the $22tn US Treasury market signalled a growing comfort that the Omicron coronavirus variant would not hamper the recovery. The 10-year US Treasury real yield, which strips out the effect of inflation on the debt, climbed to minus 0.97 per cent, its highest level since mid-December.</p> <p>Traders also pointed to a rally in shares of economically sensitive stocks in the banking, industrial and energy industries as a sign that optimism over business activity had returned.</p> <p>“The outright number of new Covid cases combined with reports of less severe symptoms reinforces the notion that while the coronavirus is here to stay, the subsequent variants will become increasingly less disruptive from an economic perspective,” said Ian Lyngen, a strategist with BMO Capital Markets. </p> <p>In US stock markets, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent, as shares in companies typically viewed as beneficiaries of Covid-related restrictions declined. Chinese ecommerce group Pinduoduo fell more than 11 per cent, while JD.com, Okta and Peloton slid more than 3 per cent. Zoom Video Communications dipped 2 per cent.</p> <p>The Nasdaq had climbed 1.2 per cent on Monday as Apple became the first company to reach a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57f57303-82b9-49db-89ee-54888e1c714d\">market capitalisation of $3tn</a>. Analysts are increasingly concerned, however, about US equity markets becoming overly reliant on the performance of a group of large tech companies.</p> <p>“The US economy looks to be deep into its business cycle, which typically sees market leadership narrow to mega-cap stocks,” said Tan Kai Xian, analyst at Gavekal. </p> <p>The broader-based S&amp;P 500 stock index, traditionally looked to as a gauge for large-cap stock performance, slipped marginally on Tuesday even as two-thirds of the companies in the benchmark rose in value.</p> <p>“If the crutch of Big Tech was kicked away, then watch out,” said Patrick Spencer, vice-chair of equities at RW Baird. “The worry is that one of these very big tech stocks declines and that starts a waterfall of selling.” </p> <p>In Europe, the yield on the 10-year UK gilt increased by 0.12 percentage points to 1.08 per cent, as traders also bought shares in UK and European businesses whose fortunes are pegged to economic growth and the easing of coronavirus restrictions.</p> <p>London's blue-chip FTSE 100 share index rose 1.6 per cent as its multinational commodities and banking stocks outperformed. The UK's more domestically focused FTSE 250 rose 1.8 per cent, led by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20ae6c32-2c03-45ad-af8d-b4310c5acce0\">travel shares</a>.</p> <p>Europe's regional Stoxx 600 equity gauge added a further 0.8 per cent on Tuesday, building on a record high set in the previous trading session. </p> <p>“The global theme in markets is that we have reached peak Covid,” said Roger Lee, head of UK equity strategy at Investec, after traders seized on early data that suggested that the highly transmissible Omicron variant may cause less severe illness than previous strains of the virus. </p> <p>As investors became more optimistic about coronavirus, they had also raised their expectations of the Fed and other central banks increasing interest rates, Lee added.</p> <p>“If this is the last stage of Covid then rates have to go up because inflation has to be contained,” he said.</p> <p>In Asian equity markets, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 closed 1.8 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was flat. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Eric Platt in New York 2022 'US Treasuries fall as fears subside over Omicron's impact on recovery' FT.com 4 January.
