  "title": "Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl: ‘I want to become a really wicked tap dancer'",
  "text": "<p><strong>Dave Grohl, 52, was the drummer for Nirvana before founding Foo Fighters — the group celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2020 and has won multiple awards, including 11&#xa0;Grammys and five Brits. </strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition? </strong><br>To be a famous soccer player. </p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work?</strong><br>I was a terrible student. I was a total joker, all I wanted to do was entertain everyone — my grades were terrible. I left school at 17 to start touring, to the great dismay of my father — a conservative Republican speechwriter. My mother, who was a teacher for 35 years, knew that I wasn't an idiot, but that I wasn't going to move forward in life if I was stuck in my failure in school. </p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor? </strong><br>I was raised by a brilliant, compassionate, generous, kind single mother. Her life was devoted to raising two children on a teacher's salary. She taught me to work for the things I wanted. And when I was 12 or 13, my cousin&#xa0;Tracy became a punk rocker. When I saw her leather jacket, shaved head, chains and spikes, she became my first hero. She was so empowered by her individuality. I wanted that. Musically, I have a long list of people I've played with and listened to over the years. </p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you? </strong><br>You wouldn't imagine that going on tour keeps you in shape, but it actually does. At 52, I&#xa0;feel pretty good. It's when I come home I get soft. I hate gyms, I hate working out, I hate yoga. </p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success? </strong><br>Ambition and drive. Talent has, unfortunately, only a little to do with it. I'm not the best drummer, I'm not the best guitar player, I'm&#xa0;not the best singer — but when I&#xa0;do any of those things, I do it like it's my first day on earth. Also being&#xa0;able to work with others. You&#xa0;have to be able to collaborate and co-operate.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess? </strong><br>I have never, ever been a material person — I think because I was raised with very little. What I love to collect are memories, and those I&#xa0;can hold for ever. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you? </strong><br>I'm always up to speed with what's going on. I always vote. Voting is not only a blessing and right, it's important for everyone to feel connected in that process. A lot of change begins locally. I try to do my best to help out. I just wish there was more compassion and connectivity in the world. </p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance? </strong><br>My family. I feel blessed to have the resources to take care of them. </p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest? </strong><br>With my kids — the time we spend&#xa0;swimming, or riding bikes, or&#xa0;playing video games I don't understand, or watching Harry&#xa0;Potter. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have? </strong><br>My obsession that I've had for 30 years and never revealed to anyone is that I want to become&#xa0;a really wicked tap-dancer. I can't dance, but there's something about the&#xa0;rhythm and the patterns I understand. This year I got a pair&#xa0;of tap shoes and it's going to&#xa0;happen. </p> <p><strong>What drives you on? </strong><br>I am addicted to achievement. I&#xa0;cannot sit down and relax. I can't turn off. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far? </strong><br>My kids. I'm such a dad! Each of my three daughters is a tornado, they're amazing. Musically, my proudest achievement is just survival. I've watched a lot of people I know and love not make it, in terms of staying alive. Music is a&#xa0;tricky road. </p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>I don't understand how someone can intentionally want someone else to hurt or to feel pain. </p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would he think? </strong><br>That I should have thought a little more about my choice of tattoos. </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had? </strong><br>None. Guitars, you play them, they become your best friend or worst enemy, then they disappear and that's OK — there's songs to remind you they existed. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>Having hope. Believing in life, in&#xa0;love, in the goodness that's within us all. </p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife? </strong><br>We just don't know. It's presumptuous and cocky to think we can understand the universe. </p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score? </strong><br>12½.</p> <p><em>“Medicine at Midnight”, Foo Fighters' 10th album, is released on February 5 on Roswell Records/Columbia Records, </em><a href=\"https://www.foofighters.com/\"><em>foofighters.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
