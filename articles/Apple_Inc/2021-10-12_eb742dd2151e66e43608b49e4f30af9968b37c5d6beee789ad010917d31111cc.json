  "text": "<p>There was a very public handing over of the baton on Wall Street yesterday to a new generation of dealmakers.</p> <p>Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-founders of private equity group KKR, announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/242ff7f2-4f31-4fc1-9f73-fe5db25260a1\">they were stepping back</a> from day-to-day operations.</p> <p>The pair were memorialised in the 1989 book <em>Barbarians at the Gate, </em>which recounted KKR's conquest for the conglomerate RJR Nabisco. The $25bn deal came to symbolise a new kind of scorched-earth approach to finance and dealmaking and cemented the reputations of Kravis and Roberts. Jerome Kohlberg, their mentor at Bear Stearns, was the other founder. He died in 2015.</p> <p>The hardball approach to business paid off and more than 30 years later KKR owns a portfolio of companies worth more than $650bn that employs over 800,000 people.</p> <p>Longtime co-presidents Scott Nuttall, 48, and Joe Bae, 49, will take over from the cousins Kravis and Roberts, who founded their eponymous&#xa0;firm in 1976. Both successors joined KKR in their twenties. Bae built KKR's Asian business while Nuttall focused on the firm's capital markets and credit activities.</p> <p>“We could not be more excited about this moment in time,” said Kravis, 77, and Roberts, 78, in a joint statement. “There is such a huge need for private capital to support businesses, and KKR still has so much potential even 45 years later.”</p> <h1>Read more</h1> <p>Antoine Gara and Mark Vandevelde describe how Kravis and Roberts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f75f50e7-381f-4c95-9e0f-25e32f70662d\">transformed KKR</a> into a diversified institution — almost like the conglomerates they once broke up.</p> <p>No one understood the concept of “other people's money” better than Henry Kravis and George Roberts 35 years ago, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828c08e8-caff-4c3b-a41d-de152fcf5216\">says Lex</a>.</p> <p>What's KKR without the K and the R?

Rivals fear the entrepreneur will not only dominate deep space exploration, but <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/25e2292b-a910-41c8-9c55-09096895f673\">disrupt the economics</a> of the launch business and transform the space race.</p> <p><strong>The moment of truth over Taiwan is getting closer </strong>Would the US go to war over Taiwan? That question has seemed fairly abstract for decades. Now it is increasingly&#xa0;urgent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9833d499-07ce-40eb-84e7-436023c6eb8b\">writes Gideon Rachman</a>, as the US and China engage in a dangerous game of military poker.</p> <p><strong>Nobel Prize economists turned statistics into insight</strong> Tim Harford <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9387d5d-4000-4898-967b-79ac50218a45\">pays tribute</a> to the winners of this year's Nobel Prize for economics. He says Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens developed “a toolkit to help researchers discern crisp causal relationships from fuzzy natural experiments”. </p> <p><strong>Why quitting your job is good for the economy </strong>Much has been written about why Americans are quitting their jobs in higher numbers than at any point since the turn of the millennium, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad9f2346-19ef-4695-b6c9-c0983176eb23\">writes Sarah O'Connor</a>. It isn't just an interesting sociological phenomenon, she says, but has an under-appreciated bearing on pay and productivity. </p> <p><strong>‘My life expectancy was nine years old'</strong> Plenty of people in their 30s, 40s and even 50s have yet to start saving for retirement, and are anxious about how to begin, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30b5f1b3-bdc3-4d5b-b175-4f2a1f285cf8\">including this week's Money Clinic guest David</a>, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and never thought he would reach retirement. But thanks to a revolutionary new treatment, he is now planning for when he ends work. </p> <p><strong>A global AI bill of rights is desperately needed </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e42c58e-b3d4-4db5-9ddf-7e6c4b853366\">Bill of Artificial Intelligence Rights</a> proposed by the White House science advisers could ensure a person's right to know if and how AI is making decisions about them, writes Anjana Ahuja.
