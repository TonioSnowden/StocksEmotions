  "text": "<p>A top investor at the world's largest hedge fund says he does not expect a repeat of the “Great Inflation” of the 1970s.</p> <p>Bob Prince, who runs Bridgewater Associates with Ray Dalio and Greg Jensen, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/717204fa-45e0-4b11-94c2-cf50b8aacbc0\">told the Financial Times</a> that long-running deflationary forces would eventually curtail recent price rises and that while “you are going to get some inflation”, it would be “moderate”.</p> <p>His comments come amid a furious debate on Wall Street over whether a buzzing economic recovery, a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus and supply chain problems would cause a lasting surge in prices for goods and services. </p> <p>John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2327df9-513b-4f04-a7f7-1bb73e887582\">made some of his most bullish comments</a> since the start of the pandemic but insisted the US economy was not ready for the central bank to start pulling back its hefty support. </p> <p>The comments from Williams came on the eve of an appearance by Jay Powell in Congress. In prepared remarks released yesterday, the Federal Reserve chair pointed to the “sustained improvement” in the economy but highlighted the uneven pace of the recovery. </p> <p>Senior Democratic lawmaker Carolyn Maloney warned the Fed against putting on the brakes “too quickly”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f108814a-c2ae-4da3-8a6b-7cf1c16e8931\">in an interview</a> with the Financial Times before Powell's appearance. </p> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1. EU opens probe against Google's advertising technology</strong> The European Commission has opened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8d7bc05-7e58-43f9-b977-47bbbe5802aa\">a formal antitrust probe</a> against Google to examine whether the US group has broken EU rules by giving an advantage to its own online display ad technology services, to the detriment of rivals.&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>In other <strong>technology news</strong>, Facebook's first advertising partner in its Oculus virtual reality headset <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5258ba2-1ee5-4233-aa91-896ac3a5d7b3\">has pulled out of the initiative</a> less than a week after the tie-up was announced, following a backlash from the gaming community.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. FDA accused of cozy ties with Big Pharma</strong> The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of aducanumab, a contentious Alzheimer's drug made by Biogen, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4013ea99-0413-40f5-b93c-f3de001ccf12\">has led to calls</a> for acting commissioner Janet Woodcock to be removed amid criticism that the medicines regulator is too close to Big Pharma.</p> <p><strong>3. Student athletes win US Supreme Court showdown against NCAA</strong> The US Supreme Court yesterday sided with student athletes who brought an antitrust challenge against the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c00913e-afe8-4dc8-8881-38d93d713d49\">blockbuster ruling</a> could reshape the country's more than $14bn college sports industry.</p> <p><strong>4. Soho House files for New York IPO</strong> The owner of private members' clubs in North America, Europe and Asia, has outlined <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f377be1-c9df-4ac3-a3be-502f4cd510ca\">aggressive plans for expansion</a> as it filed to go public in New York. The group is to be renamed Membership Collective Group as part of the initial public offering which is targeting a $3bn valuation, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p><strong>5. Hong Kong's Apple Daily at risk of closure</strong> The pro-democracy tabloid is on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9cbb594-aa2e-491e-a0b4-2340a2423bbe\">the verge of closure</a> after its assets were frozen by the government last week, restricting its ability to operate. The asset freeze follows the arrest of two of the newspaper's senior executives and the imprisonment of founder Jimmy Lai. </p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The closure of a container shipping terminal in <strong>Shenzhen, China</strong>&#xa0;in late May after port workers tested positive for Covid-19, is leading to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3c55dca-2ee7-488a-ad68-9286822b881c\">strains on the global supply chain</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Eurozone consumers</strong> are flocking back to bars and restaurants, booking holidays and travelling to work, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0619910-525a-4191-9aae-a0907eb5fb99\">according to high-frequency data</a>.
