  "text": "<p>Which college majors pay off? Is graduate school a golden goose or a money pit? Are Ivy League degrees usually worth it?</p><p>The Wall Street Journal answers these questions—and many more—in a first-of-its kind guide to student debt. Readers can download The WSJ Guide to Student Loans: Navigating the Myths and Misunderstandings About College Debt, free by following this link.</p><p>With chapters on a range of undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as for parent borrowers and people who have already taken out loans, the guide provides valuable information on how to measure the potential payoff of various degrees before borrowing, and how to manage debt that is already outstanding.</p><p>As college costs have ballooned and higher education has become a must-have for many careers, borrowing has become a standard path to pay for school. More than 43 million borrowers collectively owe about $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. A pause in payments and freeze on interest during the coronavirus pandemic has provided borrowers some relief, but those moratoriums are set to expire later this year.</p><p>Some Democratic politicians have made additional student loan forgiveness a priority political issue, though sweeping forgiveness measures appear dead for now. Any efforts to ease the burden on borrowers are likely to push the federal loan program deeper into the red—a cause for concern for many taxpayers.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What questions do you have about student debt? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Colleges, meanwhile, financially benefit from the easy money of student loans. A series of Journal articles in 2021 explored how wealthy private colleges leave graduate students and parents eligible for no-limit federal loans with burdensome debt. The series further explored how prestigious private schools leverage their brands to charge top-dollar for graduate degrees that yield paltry pay prospects.</p><p>Expanding on this reporting, the Journal's new guide takes a broader look at how colleges package financial aid for students and parents, and which degrees offer the best and worst financial outcomes. Among the findings:</p><p>* Many wealthy schools dish out generous undergraduate financial aid—but not all do. At some colleges with big endowments, students from low-income families owed as much after scholarships, on average, as students from wealthier backgrounds.</p><p>* Fields that typically required a master's degree had a lower annual median salary in 2020 ($76,800) than ones that usually required a bachelor's degree ($78,020), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>* In some cases, graduate-degree programs at public universities led to higher salaries than programs at prestigious private schools in the same city. Yet the private-college students were left with far more debt.</p><p>This guide includes the answers to common questions about student debt and step-by-step directions to where families can find additional information about the earnings prospects of specific programs and other financial aid resources—materials that are sometimes difficult to find. The Journal analyzed publicly available federal student-loan data to compile dozens of charts that show which programs leave students with high debt loads compared with their pay, which ones offer borrowers a good bang for their buck, and much more.</p><p>In addition, the guide contains brief case studies of borrowers, tips from financial aid experts, checklists to help navigate the borrowing process and a glossary of commonly used terms. The digital format of the guide allows readers to click easily from one section to another. The guide was reported and written by Andrea Fuller, Melissa Korn, Rebecca Ballhaus, Tawnell D. Hobbs and Rebecca Smith, with data analysis by Ms. Fuller.</p><p>Taking on student debt can be one of the most consequential financial decisions borrowers can make in their lifetimes. With The WSJ Guide to Student Loans, readers can make better-informed decisions before signing up for debt that can linger for decades.</p><p>Check out this link to download The WSJ Guide to Student Loans.
