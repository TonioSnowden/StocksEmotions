  "text": "<p>My 1959 Gibson 335 never leaves my house. It's one of those special guitars. If I only had two minutes to get out of the house in a real emergency, I'd take my MacBook and that guitar. My Les Paul \"Phenix\" -- which was lost in a plane crash in 1980 and found its way back to me about 18 years ago -- is amazing, but it's for certain things. I use it a lot, obviously, but the 335 can do anything. If I were only allowed one guitar, that guitar could do it all.</p><p>I have been at the cutting edge with Eventide audio since the '70s. I have stuff they want for their museum! They recently sent me their Rose Delay Effect Pedal before it came out, and I loved it. I made some suggestions, because it needed to have presets, so I feel like the pedal has a lot of me in it.</p><p>I've used my 1950s Telefunken U47 microphone on every recording I've made since 1980. Every time I work with a new engineer, they want to try their own setup. And every time, when they try my mic, they say, \"Wow. What is that?\"</p><p>We all love our iPhones and iPads, but my MacBook Pro has my life in it. I'm always putting down ideas, so it's for my creative side, too. It's a studio in a box. I plug in a Universal Audio Apollo Twin Mk II mixer so that I can work on music in my bedroom.</p><p>-- Edited from an interview by Jeff Slate</p>",
