  "title": "EU Vote Freezes Out Lightning Charger",
  "text": "<p>The European Parliament on Tuesday voted to approve the new rules, which aim to force companies that sell portable electronic devices in the EU to ensure they are equipped with a USB-C charging port, technology that is commonly used in new laptop computers and Android phones. The aim is to have a common standard that would allow consumers to use the same cable to charge all their portable electronic devices.</p><p>\"The common charger will finally become a reality in Europe,\" said Alex Agius Saliba, a member of the Parliament from Malta. He said the new rules \"will benefit everyone -- from frustrated consumers to our vulnerable environment.\"</p><p>The EU legislation is a blow to Apple, which uses its Lightning ports on new iPhones. Replacement chargers for iPhones tend to be more expensive than USB-C cables.</p><p>Apple has said the law would harm innovation and inconvenience users.</p>",
