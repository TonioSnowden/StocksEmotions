  "text": "<p>Of all the questions raised by this braided, twisty New Orleans crime series, the chief one on some viewers' minds will be: when does Bryan Cranston — or rather his character — go crazy and murder lots of people? Playing a decent, fair-minded judge undoubtedly puts the brakes on but surely it's only a matter of time. Marathon-running judge Michael Desiato goes the extra mile — literally — to serve his multiracial community, jogging past a black defendant's home to dismantle a cop's dubious testimony. Which seems more like the defence attorney's job, but whatever. Despite Michael's high-mindedness, events quickly demonstrate that notions of truth and impartiality take on a different hue when people like him — white, affluent, establishment — find themselves in the descending pan of Lady Justice's scales. </p> <p>We're given the bird's-eye view of impending tragedy as weak, skinny Adam grabs his books and asthma inhaler and slouches towards his knackered old Volvo to drive to school. On the fancy side of town, another teenager beams with delight at the vintage motorcycle his doting parents have bought for his forthcoming birthday. Skid-lid strapped on tight, Rocco Baxter takes his sweet new toy out for a spin, while Adam diverges from his usual route on a personal mission. As the pair, unknown to each other, cross town, the one joyful, the other nervous and distracted, we can predict some terrible convergence of the twain. </p> <p>It's safe to say that the kid on the bike comes off worst, and the inhaler is crucial. One wheezing 911 call later, Adam scoots back home (nosy neighbour alert!) for a weepy scrub up and a scene reminiscent of one of those sexist laundry advertisements where a clueless male teen stabs random buttons in the hope of hitting a boil wash. Adam (Hunter Doohan, impressively wrecked) may be in shock, but those incriminating internet searches are just sloppy. </p> <p>The staged robbery intended to dispose of the Volvo inevitably goes wrong, but with the upside of making junior gang member Kofi Jones (Lamar Johnson, one to watch) a convenient patsy. But we could have guessed from one look at his volatile dad that Rocco was no ordinary kid, and Baxter Sr is not temperamentally inclined to leave important tasks like revenge to official channels. Having Tony Curran play your sidekick is generally a bad sign. </p> <p>If what you need right now is a quivering ball of tension in the pit of your stomach, this should do the trick. As the coils of the plot tighten python-like around him, Desiato utters the fateful words, “You can't judge a man on what you fear he might become.” </p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Sky Atlantic from March 2 at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
