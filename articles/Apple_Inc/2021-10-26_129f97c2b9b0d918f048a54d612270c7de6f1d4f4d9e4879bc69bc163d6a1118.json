  "text": "<p>According to the affidavit of an anonymous Facebook whistleblower, an executive at the social network said some years ago that a firestorm engulfing the company <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/facebook-new-whistleblower-complaint/\">would quickly fade</a>. Moreover, the executive allegedly said there would be little to no fallout because “we are printing money in the basement”.</p> <p>The executive has denied uttering the phrase. But it is just one small element in a public storm over the conduct of the US social network. It released its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db376f67-5b51-4670-a0cc-c4901b3d96f2\">third-quarter results</a> against the backdrop of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67ad6eda-eb1c-4c97-bb3e-464c65bd63e7\">Facebook Papers</a>. </p> <p>These internal documents imply that Mark Zuckerberg was either unwilling or unable to stop the ill effects of problematic content shared on the site. This aside, the Facebook chief executive acknowledges that the company is facing formidable commercial challengers.</p> <p>Daily active users on Facebook were up 6 per cent on last year, a lower growth rate than the previous quarter, which itself was a point drop from the first quarter. Advertising revenue fell quarter over quarter. Facebook blamed this on tougher restrictions on in-app tracking of users by Apple, curbs the social network group blames on the ambitions of the devices giant to expand in advertising.</p> <p>It was in this context of growing competition that Zuckerberg said he would strengthen Facebook's ecommerce offering. That was a nod to new behemoth Shopify, as well as Apple. He admitted TikTok and Apple had made serious inroads among Gen Z. The founder said “young adults” — who he calls creators — will become Facebook's primary focus. </p> <p>Finally, Zuckerberg announced the company would split out its Reality Labs, which makes augmented reality and virtual reality products that together contribute to the burgeoning so-called metaverse.</p> <p>As much as Facebook would like to move forward from the problems in its core business, media and politicians will not let go just yet. Cash generation from advertising is subsidising everything else. The Reality Labs unit will cost $10bn in forgone operating profit next year.</p> <p>Facebook shares are off 15 per cent of their 2021 peak. Its forward earnings estimate have been knocked down slightly, indicating that its earnings multiple has fallen from 28 to 23 times. A $50bn just-announced share buyback will ease the sting. The money machine keeps on cranking. But it is losing a little momentum.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Facebook: planning a facelift to look more youthful' FT.com 26 October.
