  "text": "<p>While some have stoically kneaded sourdough bread, others appear to have found an alternative means of alleviating lockdown boredom: tequila. Diageo's US sales of the liquor surged 80 per cent&#xa0;in the last six months of 2020. Sales of one brand, Casamigos, more than doubled. Half-year sales growth thus breezed past market expectations with North America — Diageo's biggest and most profitable market — delivering a rollicking 12.3 per cent.</p> <p>US drinking habits helped: there, four out of five drinks are drunk at home rather than in bars and restaurants. Lockdowns thus put a smaller dent in sales. Tequila plays into the trend for at-home cocktail evenings, with Margaritas being mixed alongside less celebrated drinks such as the Paloma. Apparently, some aficionados are even able to convince themselves that the liquor, made from agave, carries artisanal and organic stripes.</p> <p>Diageo also reckons it has benefited from a clearing out of the drinks cabinet. It <a href=\"https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/press-releases/diageo-sells-portfolio-of-brands-to-sazerac/\">ditched</a> 19 of its more dated brands a couple of years back, replacing those with the likes of rhubarb and apple gin (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/press-releases/diageo-to-acquire-chase-distillery/\">Chase Distillery</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d656c2ac-b90a-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c\">Seedlip</a>, a non-alcoholic spirit that comes with an alcoholic price tag.</p> <p>Of course, closed bars and pubs still took a toll. Grounded flights meant fewer travellers stocking up on duty free, another lucrative business. Both channels carry higher margins than shop sales, resulting in some erosion to gross margins. </p> <p>Diageo may have wrongfooted analysts but it is not so foolish as to provide guidance for the full year. The upcoming Chinese new year, usually a time of mass travel and feasting, will be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-55791858\">muted</a>. Much of Europe is back in lockdown, keeping a lid on sales. When pubs and bars were open for business in July and August, revenues were more than double those in the ensuing four months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Besides, not all regions have proved as resilient as the US. In Ireland net sales were down 37 per cent; those in southern Europe fell by a fifth. Some of the smaller bright spots look a little faddish: even in the frozen north there is surely a limit to how much Baileys Apple Pie a person can neck.</p> <p>That is a large caveat. Still, this is a company sticking with its progressive dividend policy, lifting the payout by 2 per cent to 27.96p. Fittingly for a drinks company, it is not fretting about liquidity. Buybacks could even be back on the table next fiscal year. It is priced in line with European peers. Investors can afford to raise a modest congratulatory tipple.</p> <h2>Oh dear, prudence</h2> <p>In a parallel universe, Prudential is Asia-Pacific's biggest insurer with a market value of more than £100bn, <em>writes Bryce Elder.</em><br><br>In our own shared reality that title goes instead to AIA, the business Pru failed to buy in 2010 for less than £25bn after shareholders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c80ad6c4-6de3-11df-b5c9-00144feabdc0\">kicked up a fuss</a>. Their loss of confidence in former boss Tidjane Thiam cursed Pru to a lost decade, both strategically and by market value.<br><br>Mike Wells, Mr Thiam's successor, has spent most of his tenure figuring out different ways to unwind&#xa0;Pru's conglomerate discount and separate its fast-growing Asian arm from the more lumbering remainder. Slow progress meant its market value has drifted back to 2014 levels below £33bn, so an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc612830-f10d-4870-824c-5332163b1e2d\">update on Thursday</a> provided some good news: separation will happen much quicker than previously indicated.<br><br>The bad news? Well, there was quite a lot of that. <br><br>Plans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa94ecd7-266a-44d6-bbd9-383dbf79b822\">set out in August</a> to float American business Jackson National Life have been scrapped in favour of a demerger. Most of Jackson's US-listed equity will be divvied up among Pru shareholders by the second quarter of 2021, irrespective of their desire and mandate to hold it.<br><br>The weight of post-split sellers seems likely to squash any chance of Jackson Life making a strong debut. This new route taken would, therefore, suggest IPO marketing in recent months had left management with little optimism about the likely valuation.<br><br>Worse was to come. New modelling has taken a lump out of Jackson reserves, so Pru can no longer load some group debt on to the spin-off. Bolstering US capital while keeping the Asian business funded now needs a pre-split equity raise of between $2.5bn and $3bn.<br><br>In theory it should all be a zero-sum game. Pru is following its original plan to reduce leverage while tilting investment towards Asia, where every $1 spent generates a $6 in profit. Funding the plan with new equity rather than float proceeds will&#xa0;dilute&#xa0;earnings per share — UBS estimates a hit this year of between 8 and 10 per cent — but Jackson stock ought to be the compensation.<br><br>Yet Pru shares had tumbled more than 9 per cent by early afternoon as its Asian ambitions were eclipsed by a distaste for US paper and an incomplete explanation for thinner reserves, which stoked&#xa0;worries about capital levels across the wider group. “Investor confidence in management will be severely dented,” said Bank of America analysts.<br><br>We have been here before. But this time around, a slimmed-down and wounded Pru looks much more like a target for one of the big Asian insurers than its frustrated potential acquirer.</p> <p><em>Diageo: louise.lucas@ft.com<br>Prudential: bryce.elder@ft.com</em></p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Runaway tequila sales make Diageo well worth a shot' FT.com 28 January.
