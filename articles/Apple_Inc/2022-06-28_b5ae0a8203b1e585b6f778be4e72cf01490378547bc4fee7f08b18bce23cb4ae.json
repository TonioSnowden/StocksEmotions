  "title": "China's Xi to Visit Hong Kong, a City of Dashed Democracy Dreams 25 Years After Handover; Debate over the city's electoral systems dominated much of the quarter-century under Chinese rule, until Beijing moved to end it for good",
  "text": "<p>A quarter of a century on, Ms. Lau is no longer a legislator, and the push for real democracy has been crushed. She spends some of her downtime visiting former colleagues jailed under a national-security crackdown over the past two years that has eviscerated the opposition movement of which Ms. Lau was once one of the most influential figures.</p><p>\"People just saw everything disintegrating before their very eyes,\" Ms. Lau said. \"So many people both here and elsewhere never thought things could happen so fast—that Hong Kong, the freedoms and the safety could collapse like that.\"</p><p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping's planned visit to Hong Kong this week, to mark the 25th anniversary of its handover from the U.K. on July 1, bookends a period in which Beijing has taken full control of the city, ending debate over its political future. Competing visions of democracy between China and Hong Kong's democracy campaigners dominated the first quarter of a century under Chinese rule, setting both sides on a collision course that erupted in periodic mass protests before China cracked down.</p><p>The Basic Law, the city's 1997 constitutional document as a Chinese special administrative region, guaranteed and circumscribed greater democracy for Hong Kong, including ultimately electing the city's leader by universal suffrage. Chinese officials, however, had a narrow interpretation: that only \"patriots\" loyal to Beijing could be eligible for election to the city's highest post and other offices. They have said approving candidates is essential to ensure Hong Kong remains a stable part of the motherland and not a potential launchpad for challenges to the Communist Party.</p><p>Back in 1997, memories of the Tiananmen Square massacre eight years earlier were still fresh and fears abounded that Hong Kong—home to a vibrant civil society, free press and a strong sense of local identity—could be put under the yoke of the military.</p><p>Watching convoys of People's Liberation Army trucks cross the mainland China border into Hong Kong in the early hours of July 1, journalist Mark Clifford said he felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>\"I wouldn't have said I feared the worst, but I was cognizant the worst could happen,\" said Mr. Clifford, who was then covering Hong Kong for Businessweek. Mr. Clifford later joined the board of the parent of pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, which shut down last year after authorities seized its funds and arrested its founder, Jimmy Lai, and some of its executives.</p><p>In the end, Beijing didn't need the PLA. The security law imposed two years ago enabled the destruction of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement with the stroke of a pen. The law criminalized actions including secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. Its vague wording has meant authorities can interpret it broadly.</p><p>\"It's been a slow build, but then pretty rapid at the end,\" said Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor who sailed away on the Royal Yacht Britannia after the midnight handover took place. Mr. Patten blames the abrupt end to Hong Kong's bid for democracy on Beijing's authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi.</p><p>\"The most important reality is the nature of the Communist Party in an increasingly totalitarian state, rather than the nature of Hong Kong,\" he said.</p><p>Britain's colonial governors had ushered in democratic changes in the years before the handover, but the system had never allowed people to elect the city's leader and its legislature was still chosen by complex mechanisms that were only partially decided by popular vote.</p><p>After 1997, the fight over democracy in Hong Kong became increasingly polarized. By 2019, when more than a million people marched in the streets to demand democracy and a violent social uprising followed, the pressure to choose sides between pro-democracy \"yellow\" and pro-establishment \"blue\" even split families apart.</p><p>On the same night that Ms. Lau was wrapping the city's Legislative Council in yellow ribbon, Ronny Tong watched the handover ceremony on TV, nervous for the future. One of Hong Kong's leading lawyers, he increasingly became a democracy advocate in the coming years, co-founding the Civic Party, a moderate faction of the pro-democracy camp that won seats in the city's legislature.</p><p>In 2007, Beijing laid out a timetable for direct elections of the city's chief executive to be achieved within a decade, sparking years of tussle in the city's pro-democracy camp. Beijing's insistence that candidates be vetted was a compromise that Mr. Tong viewed as an acceptable step toward fuller democracy.</p><p>\"They wanted a perfect, ideal system,\" he said of his pro-democracy allies. \"I don't blame them, but it was doomed to fail.\"</p><p>Ms. Lau believed that elections that didn't give people a say in the choice of candidates on the ballot were no elections at all.</p><p>\"The universal suffrage they promised wasn't real universal suffrage,\" she said.</p><p>The proposal ultimately offered by Beijing in August 2014 sparked large protests and a near three-month occupation of city roads. Ignored by the government, the movement ultimately lost steam.</p><p>The democracy movement was revitalized in 2019 after protests sparked by a proposed government bill that would have paved the way for extradition of criminal suspects in Hong Kong to mainland China. For months, the city was rocked by its worst unrest in half a century, and the uprising posed the biggest public challenge to Mr. Xi's rule. They were quashed with the security law in 2020.</p><p>\"Hong Kong is not a sovereign state,\" said C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's chief executive at the time of the 2014 protests and a backer of the security law. \"In Hong Kong we're just a local authority.\"</p><p>By then, Mr. Tong had resigned from the Civic Party, believing its members had grown too radical. In 2017, he joined the cabinet of newly elected Chief Executive Carrie Lam, becoming its only member with a pro-democracy background. Many of his former colleagues are now in jail.</p><p>Ms. Lau quit the city's legislature in 2016. Scheduled to take a vacation to Germany a day after the handover anniversary, she said some friends have jokingly suggested that they accompany her to the airport in case the police stop her from leaving.</p><p>\"I hope it won't happen, but if it happens it happens: What can I do?\" she said.</p><p>Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com</p><p>China's Xi to Visit Hong Kong, a City of Dashed Democracy Dreams 25 Years After Handover</p>",
