  "title": "Apple to keep 30% fee for NFT purchases on apps; In a new set of stricter rules, Apple outlined what apps can do with nonfungible tokens and crypto on the App Store.",
  "text": "<p>But even with the new rules, Apple won't be rejecting calls to exempt nonfungible tokens from a 30% fee on in-app purchases.</p><p>The 30% fee has been criticized by app makers who accuse the company of taking too large a share, and leaving customers footing the bill. It even led to a lawsuit between Fortnite developer Epic Games and Apple, a relationship from which Epic Games has made $600 million. The fee goes almost as far back as the iPhone. It was first introduced in 2008, a year after the iPhone was introduced.</p><p>Apple's new rules around crypto mean that apps may now \"facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange,\" given that they are offered only in countries where the app has appropriate licensing and permissions to provide a crypto exchange, the guidelines state.</p><p>The updated wording around cryptocurrency does not appear to change Apple's existing rules, which permit in-app crypto trading on platforms like FTX and Coinbase (which don't pay 30% fees).</p><p>Apple to keep 30% fee for NFT purchases on apps</p>",
