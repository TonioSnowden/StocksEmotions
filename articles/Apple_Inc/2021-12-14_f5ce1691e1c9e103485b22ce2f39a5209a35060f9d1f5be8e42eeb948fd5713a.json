  "text": "<p>If there were any <strong>BT</strong> shareholders who still held out hope of a swift bid for the group after Reliance Industries takeover talk came to nothing last month, <strong>Patrick Drahi</strong> has dashed them this morning. </p> <p>The six-month lock-up preventing the billionaire's<strong> Altice</strong> <strong>UK</strong> from bidding for the telecoms group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42756b08-89ff-4639-805d-dc36c255efe7\">expired at the weekend</a>. This morning he raised his stake from 12.1 per cent to 18 per cent. But he's also reiterated that he does not intend to make a takeover offer for the company, starting the clock on another half-year standstill. </p> <p>Drahi said he had “engaged constructively” with the board and management in recent months and “look forward to continuing that dialogue”. He said he remained “fully supportive of their strategy”, in particular BT's full fibre programme. </p> <p>If you need a recap on BT bid talk — and why it's probably wishful thinking — do check out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfc0eac5-0db1-42b1-9385-54bbf81d826a\">this column</a> from my colleague <strong>Helen Thomas</strong>. If you disagree, tell me why at&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\">citybulletin@ft.com</a>.</p> <p><em>The FT is currently trialing a short-form audio digest of the day's top headlines.</em> <em>Click&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/y8b534_o_O5lR8gkK4Q7EA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjmYK0P4R_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_bZhN_HrG1ITZ29yZG9uLnNtaXRoQGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\"><em>here</em></a>&#xa0;<em>to find out more.</em></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>UK employment data</strong> paint a now-familiar picture this morning. Record numbers of vacancies with more than 1.2m jobs unfilled, the number of employees on payrolls now 424,000 above pre-pandemic levels as the economy bounces back. The unemployment rate is still slightly higher than before March 2020, but fell to 4.2 per cent in the three months to October despite the end of the furlough scheme. Annual growth in total pay for the quarter was 4.9 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Rentokil Initial </strong>is normally known for its small roll-up deals, but today it has announced a big one. The pest control and cleaning business, which has a market capitalisation of £11.6bn, is buying US group Terminix in a cash-and-shares deal that values the target at $6.7bn. Rentokil plans to issue 643m new shares to fund the deal. </p> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> <strong>Retail</strong>, the joint venture between Ocado and <strong>Marks and Spencer</strong>, reported falling revenues in its latest quarter as labour shortages held back sales growth. While the number of customer orders increased, the value of each order has dropped as customers return to pre-pandemic shopping habits. Ocado Retail said its 2021 results would be in line with guidance, and that it expected the group to return to “mid-teens revenue growth” next year as it expanded capacity. But it warned profit margins would fall in 2022 during a “significant year of investment”. </p> <p>Separately, yesterday a judge found in favour of <strong>Ocado</strong> in a patent dispute with AutoStore, which alleged the UK group had infringed its IP. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>China Mobile</strong>, the world's largest telecoms company by number of subscribers, has received regulatory approval to list in <strong>Shanghai</strong> months after delisting from New York following the imposition of <strong>US sanctions</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/178c692f-82a4-407e-9992-f251c2f5d13d#post-bd36a000-5375-48a0-ac2a-dc0a168b5c45\">William Langley reports</a> how the move will align the company, which also has a listing in Hong Kong, with state goals to encourage domestic ownership of the country's national champions. </p> <p><strong>NSO Group</strong>, the Israeli spyware manufacturer, is considering a sale of the company or a shutdown of its controversial <strong>Pegasus</strong> unit, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3e90890-0a4d-4290-a111-cb37a5b7d502\">our correspondents report</a>. The company has edged closer to a default on $500m in loans after being blacklisted by the US government last month. NSO Group is also considering turning Pegasus into a “defensive” product, a move the company estimates could raise as much as $200m from US-based investors, but it is unclear how NSO or the Israeli government could ensure the spyware is only used defensively.</p> <p><strong>Apple</strong> faces a probe over whether it retaliated against a <strong>whistleblower</strong> who complained of workplace harassment and unsafe working conditions, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/973aae8d-21d9-4e84-8912-ead071c7935d\">correspondents report from San Francisco and New York</a>. The inquiry by the US Department of Labor follows claims by a senior engineering program manager, who was fired in September for allegedly leaking confidential information. Ashley Gjovik alleged that she was dismissed under a false pretext following numerous complaints that led to more than a dozen instances of retaliation including job reassignment.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>My pick of the day comes from Elaine Moore, the <strong>Lex</strong> deputy editor usually based in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, who writes on the rise of <strong>apps</strong> offering relief from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/221cf7c4-56e7-4c7e-b6c0-cc3737da0330\">stress of screen time</a>. <strong>Mindfulness</strong> start-ups seem like a lucrative solution to problems the tech sector created. But they are good for employers, not necessarily for employees, she argues. “Online meditation is not a cure-all for situations in which better pay or careful management would be more helpful.”</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Drahi raises BT stake but rules out bid ' FT.com 14 December.
