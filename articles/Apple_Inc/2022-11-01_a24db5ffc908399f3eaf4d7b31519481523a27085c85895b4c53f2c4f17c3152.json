  "title": "AMD Forecasts Deepening Slump in PC Sales as Consumer Demand Softens; Chip maker's glum outlook reflects turn in demand after Covid-fueled surge",
  "text": "<p>The subdued outlook reflected a challenged market for PCs that its chips feature in, and follows a warning last month for the third quarter, when AMD, a competitor to Intel Corp., told investors that the market was declining faster than expected and reduced its revenue guidance.</p><p>AMD reported third-quarter results Tuesday, including sales of $5.6 billion, which was in line with that warning. The company posted net income of $66 million, down 93% from the prior-year's figure to reflect accounting changes from a recent acquisition and higher research and development spending.</p><p>The muted outlook for the fourth quarter comes as many tech companies get stung by slowing consumer spending, rising interest rates and soaring inflation. The turnabout follows a long-running surge in demand for technology amid the shift toward learning and working remotely at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Intel last week said it was cutting costs aggressively to cope with the downturn, including through targeted layoffs. The company reported a 20% drop in third-quarter sales and forecast even weaker revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. all gave worse-than-expected outlooks last week, although Apple Inc. bucked declines in global smartphone sales this year, reporting record revenue for the third quarter.</p><p>Tech companies have been hardest hit in arenas most sensitive to consumer demand, like PCs for AMD and Intel. Sales in the AMD division that includes chips for PCs fell by 40% to $1 billion in the third quarter, the company said. But the datacenter division, which houses its server chips, posted a 45% rise in sales to $1.6 billion, around what analysts expected.</p><p>The company's gaming division—AMD sells chips that go into popular videogame consoles and for PC gaming—rose 14% to $1.6 billion of revenue.</p><p>AMD's stock rose by over 1% in aftermarket trading.</p><p>While AMD and Intel have struggled in recent quarters, other chip makers have been less directly impacted by economic woes. Companies that cater to the automotive industry, for example, continue to experience high demand for less cutting-edge chips that has caused a shortage and delayed production at the world's top auto makers. Toyota Motor Corp. on Tuesday lowered its production targets, citing persistent issues with chips.</p><p>U.S. chip makers Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp., which have large automotive businesses, both said recently that demand in that market remained healthy, even as there have been new signs of weakness in some chips sold for industrial uses. NXP Semiconductors NV, a Dutch chip maker that derives about half its revenue from the auto industry, said Monday that supplies were constrained and demand was resilient despite economic uncertainty.</p><p>As they confront headwinds in consumer-electronics markets, some chip makers, including AMD, are facing new U.S. curbs on dealings with China. Some of AMD's most advanced chips geared toward artificial intelligence calculations require a license from the Commerce Department to be sold in China, although the company has said it doesn't believe there is a material impact to its business.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>AMD Forecasts Deepening Slump in PC Sales as Consumer Demand Softens</p>",
