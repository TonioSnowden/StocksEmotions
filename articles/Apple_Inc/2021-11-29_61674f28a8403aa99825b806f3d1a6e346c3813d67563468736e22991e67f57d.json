  "text": "<p>Tony Hathaway is the nicest bank robber you could ever meet. Wearing a hoodie and with a hat pulled down over his face, he was briefly one of the most prolific robbers in the US, stealing from 30 banks in the space of a year (from 2013 to early 2014). A former engineer at Boeing, he now concedes that his pivot to a life of crime wasn't ideal, though he always tried to be decent. “I'm not threatening anyone or putting a gun in anyone's face,” he says . “I'm just taking a little bit of money. I hate to say this, but in some respects it was kind of fun.”</p> <p>Hathaway is the subject of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/hooked/id1592401710\"><em>Hooked</em></a>, an Apple Original podcast, produced by Campside&#xa0;Media, that details his dramatic fall from grace. Following a back injury in 2005, Hathaway was prescribed the opioid OxyContin, which dulled the pain but was also highly addictive. Soon he was crushing up the pills and snorting them; later, he began using heroin after discovering that it was cheaper than buying forged prescription slips. Eventually, he lost his home and resorted to living in his car.</p> <p>The series is hosted by the journalist Josh Dean, who co-presented last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d817a23-a164-4f40-9e52-b491d648c768\"><em>Chameleon: Hollywood Con Queen</em></a>. The subject is a good one, so it's a shame to find him glibly describing <em>Hooked</em> as “a story about cops and robbers, doctors and dealers, and getting high versus getting by” as if he's pitching a film — although, in fairness, a film of Hathaway's story would probably be a hit.</p> <p>Dean soon gets into his stride, though, adopting a more serious tone as he describes Hathaway's increasingly desperate attempts to support his drug habit. The biggest coup is his direct access to Hathaway, who is in prison when they first talk. After his release, the pair meet up for lengthy interviews, during which they visit landmarks from his past: the site of the last bank he robbed before his arrest (it has since been demolished); the car park where he lived in his vehicle. The most heartbreaking parts of the story — the details of which I won't reveal — involve Hathaway dragging members of his family into his chaos.</p> <p>The series is now halfway through, and the presenter has yet to delve into the opioid crisis and the system that allows the life of a middle-aged man with a well-paid job to be undone by a prescription from a family doctor. Not to provide the bigger picture would be a great oversight, since, while Hathaway's crime spree may be unusual, the circumstances that got him there are not. Otherwise, this is an extraordinary story, grippingly told.</p> <p>For wider context about Hathaway's plight, <em>Throughline</em>'s episode <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/americas-opioid-epidemic/id1451109634?i=1000459370040\">“America's Opioid Epidemic”</a> looks at the history of their use, which dates back to the US civil war. It is a tale of prejudice, greed and corporate dishonestly on a grand scale.</p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'New podcast Hooked: how opioids turned a family man into a bank robber' FT.com 29 November.
