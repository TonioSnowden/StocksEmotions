  "text": "<p>Relics of Hollywood's past are everywhere in Los Angeles, from Marilyn Monroe's handprints in the pavement outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre to the iconic sign up in the hills. But until the opening of the <a href=\"https://www.academymuseum.org/\">Academy Museum of Motion Pictures</a> on September 30, LA never had a museum dedicated to the history of its most famous export: movies. </p> <p>Designed by Pritzker-winning architect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f70d4f4-d136-45fb-8dac-0376d2715517\">Renzo Piano</a>, the Academy museum has given gala-starved Hollywood something to celebrate at a moment when Los Angeles feels it has started to turn a corner on the pandemic. The city has a lovely new museum, and the collection is impressive. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Perhaps it was because I haven't been inside a cinema for more than two years, but I was surprised by the spell many of the exhibits cast over me as I toured the museum. Entering a darkened room dedicated to cinema classics, I was immediately drawn to a hard-bound script of <em>American</em> — the original title of <em>Citizen Kane</em> — with notes jotted in pencil by Orson Welles and screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. Nearby was the original “Rosebud” sledge, lent to the museum by Steven Spielberg, which I examined as scenes from the film flashed on a screen. As I moved around the exhibit, pristine clips from <em>Raging Bull</em>, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> and even Bruce Lee films radiated movie magic. &#xa0;</p> <p>It's not just memorabilia and film snippets. The museum has exhibits highlighting the history of racism against African Americans, Native Americans and Asians in US cinema, and there are impressive sections on sound, cinematography and film editing. Perhaps my favourite installation was dedicated to the films of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3147d378-be72-4039-b9b0-d65662aca812\">Pedro Almodóvar</a>, which the great Spanish director designed himself. The room features 12 screens showing different scenes from his body of work, all running simultaneously. The effect is hypnotic — and left me wanting to rewatch many of his movies. </p> <p>Yet it was hard not to view this celebration of celluloid, housed in a complex years overdue and estimated to have cost more than $480m, in the context of the seismic shift happening in the business of filmed entertainment. The streaming revolution has given the Hollywood studios nimble and deep-pocketed competition in the form of Netflix, Amazon and Apple — a development with far-reaching implications for budgets, where and when audiences watch movies, and how much the talent gets paid. </p> <p>Any lingering doubts that the guard was changing in Hollywood ended on the night of the Academy Museum gala itself. The keynote speech was given by Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive officer, while Tinseltown royalty such as Warren Beatty, Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Dern looked on. For some, Netflix and the other streamers will never match the magic of the big screen. But, for now at least, Netflix is winning. </p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72aadca6-476d-11ea-aee2-9ddbdc86190d\">Disney</a>, Warner Bros, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0499c17-af48-488e-b789-7a68d27f95f7\">Paramount</a> and other traditional studios have belatedly sought to counter Netflix by launching their own streaming services, the promotion of which has become their top corporate priorities. We have already seen the pushback: there was the bitter fight between Disney and actress <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1550ed57-047f-46dd-a9a0-121406199076\">Scarlett Johansson</a> over the loss of her potential <em>Black Widow </em>box office bonus due to the film's release-day availability on Disney Plus. The parties settled late last month. </p> <p>Unsettled, and possibly more unsettling, is the dispute between the studios and the so-called “below the line” workers who operate cameras, build sets, style hair and do other essential jobs. Members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees this week voted to authorise their first nationwide strike in the union's 128-year history. Among their demands is a bigger cut of streaming revenues. </p> <p>Step back from all of this conflict and it would appear to be a great moment for the movies and television. Streaming has helped people around the world cope with the strains and tedium of the pandemic. And much of the actual content, whether from traditional studios or the tech companies, has been brilliant. Whatever else the streaming revolution changes, let's hope that continues.</p>  <p><strong>California has taken a tough approach</strong> to containing the spread of Covid-19 — and it appears to be paying off. More than 60 per cent of the state's population has been fully vaccinated, and the rate of new infections is the lowest in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is unequivocally great news, but the resulting rise in lunch meetings and after-work drinks has revealed that my wardrobe is not ready to do business in southern California. The dark business suits I brought to LA after working in Tokyo for the past four years (and London and New York before that) are essentially useless. And my casual wear — mostly ancient jeans and T-shirts — hardly feels appropriate for a trip to the supermarket, much less a meeting with a potential source.</p> <p>I suspect that many of us are wondering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6677ddac-3f25-485a-8bc1-d4c000f467f8\">how to dress</a> after 18 months of working from home. I don't want to be boring and simply tuck a dress shirt into some chinos. But I'm not sure that I can pull off the designer hoodie and jeans look that I spotted at a trendy West Hollywood establishment the other night. &#xa0;</p> <p>So I asked Joseph Quinones, a co-founder of LA clothing retailer Departamento, for some advice. In short, it sounds like I need to learn to relax. LA lunch meetings tend to be casual, he said, noting that jeans and sneakers are acceptable in almost all restaurants and hotels. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>If I were to interview, say, a chief executive or government official, he recommends a dry poplin shirt — allowing me to look professional but still giving off “a more relaxed appearance”. No jacket required. </p>  <p><strong>I need a win on the fashion front</strong>, given the dismal failure of another attempt to get into the groove of LA life. &#xa0;</p> <p>After 10 years away from the US, and particularly our experience in strait-laced Japan, the sight of people openly smoking legal marijuana has taken time to get used to. Same with the presence of the weed stores, many of which look like they might be selling vegan ice cream. </p> <p>My wife Jane and I decided to investigate after our Japan-to-LA jet lag began to blur into a grinding insomnia. At a nearby weed shop, a friendly, yet heavily armed, security guard led us inside where we were greeted by a staff of cheerful “budtenders”. We told our salesperson that we wanted some gummies that, according to an old friend, had him sleeping like a lamb. She produced the product, explained that we should start with a low dosage, and off we went. A great retail experience. </p> <p>Jane reported good results from the purple gummies, but I kept waking at 4am as usual. Without thinking much about it one night, I popped a whole gummy — twice the amount recommended at the shop — and quickly drifted off to sleep. &#xa0;</p> <p>It hit me about three hours later. This wasn't the toke you had off a passed joint at the Funkadelic concert that one time. This was a proper Hendrix-at-Woodstock, hearing-colours-and-seeing-sound, will-this-ever-stop <em>trip</em>. The full Huxley. &#xa0;</p> <p>I couldn't lie down any longer; I had to stand. I began to silently repeat the words “it's just the gummies, this will stop”, which helped me gain some focus, and after some time I came up with a plan. I would try to find my headphones and take a walk (yes, in LA) until it was over. &#xa0;</p> <p>The problem was my teenage children, who were watching Netflix downstairs (school hadn't started) and would certainly want to know why I was slipping out the front door in the small hours of the night. I wasn't sure I could form a sentence and absolutely certain I couldn't let them see me this way. So I went to plan B, which was to dig through the medicine chest and find some antihistamines, night-time cough syrup or something else that might induce sleep. I was successful, and eventually fell into a weird sleep. Experiment over. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/christopher-grimes\"><em>Christopher Grimes</em></a><em> is the FT's LA correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Christopher Grimes 2021 'Los Angeles diary — a celebration of celluloid' FT.com 8 October.
