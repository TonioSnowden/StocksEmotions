  "text": "<p>Steve Jobs was the towering genius&#xa0;of consumer technology, the visionary behind what is still&#xa0;the most valuable company in&#xa0;the world. He was also the second-worst thing that ever happened to&#xa0;the turtleneck.&#xa0;</p> <p>He took an item closely associated with the greatest era of men's fashion – the mid-20th century – and dragged it to Silicon Valley, which would, in style terms, be better known as Death Valley. Jobs' uniform, Issey Miyake, in black, linked a proud piece of clothing with the idiotic tech-industry notion that appearance is a distraction from the things that really matter, namely (in ascending order) brains, money and power. Simplicity, casualness, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f2d6e2c-765c-47c2-b8aa-64a8ddfd7da6\">fleece vests and normcore sneakers</a>. Oh, the horror.</p> <p>The turtleneck might have rebounded from Jobs' influence were it not for his imitator Elizabeth Holmes, of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3be72070-bc6a-4181-8ae4-a729758511ce\">the faketech company Theranos</a>, who is first among the turtleneck's abusers. She took Jobs' core notion (the black turtleneck as an anti-decorative fashion statement) and associated it with her own core attributes. Now I suspect any wearer of being a wild-eyed megalomaniacal fraud.</p> <p>Let us retake the turtleneck, then, starting with a roll-call of its great proponents. It is hard to think of any of the&#xa0;great dressers of, in round numbers, 50&#xa0;or 60 years ago without thinking of their&#xa0;turtleneck moments.&#xa0;</p> <p>Miles Davis, cooler than ice in blues and browns. Samuel Beckett, looking austere in sweaters that emphasised his thinness. Richard Roundtree – yes, I'm talking about Shaft – managed to make a&#xa0;checked, possibly acrylic sport coat look&#xa0;dangerous by pairing it with a dark-brown rollneck and threatening sideburns. James Dean, in a dark turtleneck, pea coat and slept-in hair, radiated sex and, in retrospect, doom.&#xa0;</p> <p>Along with his red beanie, I think of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75c74ea3-0ee6-4f04-aef5-8e3df96c1a6d\">Jacques Cousteau</a> as a turtleneck man, and&#xa0;don't we all dream of being Jacques Cousteau? He and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d59289c-6e36-11e8-92d3-6c13e5c92914\">Captain Haddock</a> (what a perfect shade of blue!) have forever linked the turtleneck with adventures at sea. The&#xa0;young Bob Dylan made the connection to Greenwich Village coffee shops. Alain Delon made the turtleneck dreamy, sophisticated and Nouvelle Vague.</p> <p>The absolute king of the turtleneck is the&#xa0;star of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0afeb313-c3df-476b-81f1-6b40735c0cf8\">1968's <em>Bullitt</em></a>, Steve McQueen – still the man I want to be when I grow up. If&#xa0;I&#xa0;can't have the Mustang, I'll take the jumper. <a href=\"https://spark.ft.com/editor/164e5d9d-51ad-493c-965b-fe9ef9b7f8f2?\">Derek Blasberg</a>, a fellow turtleneck fan, agrees: “No one looked better in a high neckline than McQueen. Except maybe Michael Caine in <em>Alfie</em>. Or Paul Newman.”</p> <p>All that history is a little intimidating. What is right for the contemporary mortal man? I think, with a few exceptions, one should avoid black. It is too fraught, and not just by Jobs and Holmes. There is a corny bohemian side to&#xa0;it too, redolent of hep-cats with bongos and berets. Finally and most dangerously, there&#xa0;is the tough-guy tactical-ops look, which is why <a href=\"https://www.bondsuits.com/james-bond-brings-back-the-turtleneck/\">we so often find James Bond in a black turtleneck</a>. One of the hard rules of men's style: always remember that you are absolutely nothing like James Bond.&#xa0;</p> <p>Men such as myself who are dealing with the serial humiliations of middle age will favour the turtleneck for concealing excess flesh around the neck. “Practically speaking, I love a turtleneck because it frames the jawline, which I've had a harder time finding while in lockdown,” adds Blasberg. But be careful: if a jowl overflows the top of your turtleneck, the result is not flattering (Gene Hackman, I'm sorry to say, had a bit of this problem with his otherwise on-point and off-white turtleneck in 1972's <em>The Poseidon Adventure</em>).&#xa0;</p> <p>Turtleneck with a sports jacket or suit? Yes, just make sure the jacket has some texture to match the informality of the top.&#xa0;</p> <p>Where to shop? Major fashion houses are putting some muscle around turtlenecks for autumn, in a lot of nice colours. How about <a href=\"https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/men-s-navy-merino-roll-neck-sweater-with-signature-stripe-trim\">a dark-blue knit from Paul Smith</a>? Miles would have approved. A <a href=\"https://www.hermes.com/uk/en/product/griffonne-turtleneck-sweater-HA21LKDP04HOMME/\">mustardy, loose-fitting Hermès</a> gets the 1970's reference just right. And Prada has <a href=\"https://www.yoox.com/uk/39732222/item?tp=185177&amp;utm_source=integral&amp;utm_medium=affiliation-rs&amp;utm_campaign=uk_3091229&amp;dept=men&amp;utm_content=feed&amp;tduid=1bbe5e9d09cc0b55d257beea321ffac4#cod10=39732222KJ&amp;sizeId=-1\">a pale-blue rollneck</a>, if&#xa0;you have the complexion for it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Personally, I will be looking in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7b191b9-e25b-4634-8b37-72d2d2ec59cc\">vintage stores</a> for excellent-condition woollen turtlenecks this season. A good sweater never really goes out of style anyway – as our list of icons proves.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong. Photography by Leon Mark. Styling by Evens JP Mornay.
