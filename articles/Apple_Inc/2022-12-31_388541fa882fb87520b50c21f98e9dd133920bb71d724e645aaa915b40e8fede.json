  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Huawei Says It Is Out of 'Crisis Mode' As Telecom Infrastructure Sales Grow",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Xu said Huawei expected to end the year with annual revenue of 636.9 billion yuan, or about $91.5 billion, which is essentially unchanged from a year earlier.</p><p>Mr. Xu said Huawei's core business of selling telecom infrastructure grew in 2022 and the decline in the company's once-dominant consumer device business has stabilized.</p><p>The privately held Chinese company didn't release annual profit figures or provide a complete breakdown of its business lines.</p><p>The results are the latest sign that the Shenzhen-based technology giant has steadied its business after a series of Trump-era sanctions cut it off from advanced chips, crushing its smartphone business -- briefly the largest in the world.</p><p>The U.S. has also pressed allies not to use the company's 5G telecom equipment, calling it a national security threat, which Huawei has denied.</p><p>In recent years, Huawei has sought to develop new business lines including software, cloud computing and technology for automobiles.</p><p>It has invested in companies across China's semiconductor industry as it seeks to become more independent of foreign supply chains.</p><p>Still, yearly sales remain well below the 2020 peak of more than $120 billion, indicating that the new ventures are far from offsetting its recent business losses.</p><p>Before the U.S. imposed sanctions, the Chinese technology champion routinely reported double-digit annual revenue growth, churned out smartphones that competed with those of market leaders such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. and made steady inroads into Western telecom markets.</p><p>Recent financial disclosures suggest that revenue growth at the company began to pick up in 2022. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 5.5% from a year earlier, to 191.1 billion yuan, following third-quarter growth of 6.5%.</p><p>Mr. Xu said 2023 would be a crucial year and that business priorities include keeping research and development investments high, maintaining quality despite U.S. restrictions and finding new telecom-equipment opportunities.</p>",
