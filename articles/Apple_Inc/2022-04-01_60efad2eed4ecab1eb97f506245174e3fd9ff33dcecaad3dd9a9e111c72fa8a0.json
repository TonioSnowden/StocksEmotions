  "title": "Media: Incident Tests Appeal of Bankable Star --- Will Smith, known for blockbuster roles, now under scrutiny for Oscars night slap",
  "text": "<p>\"What you have come to understand as 'Will Smith,' the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction -- a carefully crafted and honed character -- designed to protect myself,\" he writes in the book.</p><p>Still, Mr. Smith, long one of Hollywood's biggest and most bankable stars, has rarely seemed truly off-script. That is, until Sunday night, when the 53-year-old actor walked onstage during the Academy Awards and struck comedian Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife.About an hour later, he won the best actor Oscar for his role in \"King Richard,\" delivering a tearful speech in which he apologized to the academy and fellow nominees and said: \"In this business, you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that's OK.\"</p><p>What Hollywood, the academy and viewers ultimately make of that night will have ripple effects on the career of one of the planet's most likable stars.</p><p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Wednesday that it initiated disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violating its standards of conduct, \"including inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior, and compromising the integrity of the Academy.\" Mr. Smith will get at least 15 days notice of a vote regarding his violations, and he will be able to offer a written response. Discipline could include suspension, expulsion or other sanctions, the academy said. The board meets again April 18. The academy also said Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and he refused, adding, \"We also recognize we could have handled the situation differently.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith apologized Monday to Mr. Rock, the academy and viewers of the show in an Instagram post, calling his behavior \"unacceptable and inexcusable.\"</p><p>How the night will affect Mr. Smith's career remains unclear. Hollywood has talked of little else since, yet few industry powers will say anything publicly as they await news on the academy's next moves. Since the ceremony, some stars have said they found the actor's actions disturbing.</p><p>A representative for Mr. Smith said the actor wasn't commenting further. A representative for Mr. Rock didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>Mr. Smith is one of the few actors in contemporary Hollywood who can largely control his own destiny by greenlighting projects on star power alone, and often coming on board as a producer.</p><p>He has several high-profile projects in development, most notably an Apple Inc. movie called \"Emancipation\" scheduled for release this year that could put Mr. Smith back on the awards circuit in months.</p><p>Apple hasn't made any changes to its plan for a late 2022 release, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The production of \"Emancipation\" reflects Mr. Smith's signature star power. Mr. Smith stars in the true story of a runaway slave who escaped to the North and helped spark anti-slavery campaigns when photos of his lash-scarred back were published.</p><p>Bidders swooped in for the chance to work on the movie. Apple ended up coming on board to produce the film for more than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple bought the project with plans to release it in theaters and on its AppleTV+ streaming service, a rollout similar to its 2021 release of \"CODA,\" which won best picture on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Smith started his career mining his personal story, as a Philadelphia-raised rapper and star of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" a comedy series. His film career reached stratospheric heights with \"Independence Day,\" the 1996 blockbuster in which he played a pilot fending off an alien invasion.</p><p>The movie was the highest-grossing release that year. Soon Mr. Smith ruled the July 4 weekend, when \"Men in Black\" followed in 1997.</p><p>Mr. Smith started producing some of his own projects in the early 2000s, and in 2019 he founded Westbrook, a media company that focused on his entire family's entertainment pursuits. In January, the private equity-backed Candle Media paid $60 million for more than 10% of Westbrook Inc., continuing a string of Wall Street investments in celebrity-oriented media ventures.</p><p>The formation of Westbrook illustrated how Mr. Smith's celebrity is, increasingly, a package deal: his wife, Ms. Pinkett Smith, and their two children, Jaden and Willow. Soon the interpersonal relationships of the four were fodder for programming.</p><p>Mr. Smith and his family have lately embraced the same kind of confessional entertainment that helped deliver celebrity families like the Kardashians. Mr. Smith's children with Ms. Pinkett Smith, as well as Trey, a child from a previous relationship, have all played themselves on TV.</p><p>In July 2020, Mr. Smith appeared on his wife's talk show to discuss rumors of infidelity in the relationship, and a separation the couple went through about four years prior. The couple's conversation was heavy in the language of therapy, including details of Ms. Pinkett Smith's co-dependency and childhood trauma.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
