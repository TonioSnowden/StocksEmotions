  "title": "Companies Face Tax on Buybacks",
  "text": "<p>Here's a look at what the buyback measure would do.</p><p>What is a buyback?</p><p>Many public companies repurchase, or buy back, their own shares in the market. The move reduces the number of shares outstanding, can offset the shares issued to employees as compensation and improve the per-share earnings.</p><p>Wall Street generally welcomes buybacks as a sign that a company's board and executives are confident about the prospects of the business and have enough spare cash after investing in the business and paying any dividends. Critics say there are sometimes better uses for the money.</p><p>How would it work?</p><p>The legislation would tax publicly traded companies that repurchase their shares starting Jan. 1, at 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased. Excise taxes are imposed by the government on activities, goods or services, as opposed to income. The taxes would be paid by public companies, not individual investors.</p><p>The tax is on net buybacks -- total shares repurchased offset by the number of shares issued during the year, for example as part of a stock-based compensation program or because employees exercise stock options.</p><p>Some repurchases wouldn't be taxed, including buybacks under $1 million a year, those tied to certain reorganizations or for contribution to employer benefit plans.</p><p>What is spent on buybacks?</p><p>S&amp;P 500 companies bought back an estimated $281 billion in shares in the first quarter -- likely a record -- up from about $199 billion in the first quarter of 2020 and well above the previous peak of nearly $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. So far, S&amp;P 500 companies have reported about $175 billion in buybacks for the second quarter.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, S&amp;P 500 companies have bought back about $6.2 trillion in shares.</p><p>Who uses buyback most?</p><p>Most companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported at least some buybacks over their past four quarters, but 27 accounted for half of the total spending, according to data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The top five repurchasers in that period: Apple Inc. at $91.3 billion gross buybacks, Alphabet Inc. at $54.6 billion, Meta Platforms Inc. at $53.3 billion, Microsoft Corp. at $32.7 billion and Bank of America Corp. at $21.1 billion.</p><p>Companies wouldn't necessarily be taxed on the full amount of their repurchases -- the amount taxed is reduced by shares issued during the year, including those paid out as compensation. So in most cases, the tax will be calculated on a smaller tally.</p><p>For example, Apple reported repurchasing 656.3 million shares, while also issuing 106.4 million shares, in the fiscal year ended Sept. 25. Using the average price of $130 a share that the company reported for repurchases, that implies Apple spent about $71.6 billion on net buybacks, and would face a potential tax of just over $700 million.</p><p>How much will it collect?</p><p>Just over $70 billion over 10 years, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).</p><p>An earlier and nearly identical version under consideration last year was projected by the Biden administration to raise $124 billion.</p><p>Analysts say it isn't clear why the figure fell so much but note that stock prices are down sharply since the earlier estimate.</p><p>Will it affect investors?</p><p>Not directly -- the tax is on companies, not individuals.</p><p>If companies pull back on repurchases, it could affect the markets. But analysts and policy makers don't seem to expect the measure to discourage buybacks or seriously dent profits.</p><p>A Goldman Sachs estimate suggests the buyback tax alone could reduce S&amp;P 500 per-share earnings by about 0.5% if companies don't alter buyback patterns. By contrast, Goldman projected a 3% hit from three provisions scheduled to take effect in coming periods as a result of earlier tax legislation.</p><p>Why was it added to the bill?</p><p>The buyback tax in itself wasn't top of the agenda for most Democratic lawmakers, said Benjamin Salisbury, a policy analyst for Height Capital Markets. \"This is not Plan A or Plan B -- this is like Plan Q,\" Mr. Salisbury said.</p><p>Democrats couldn't afford to lose any votes in the evenly divided Senate, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) balked at a proposal to change how private-equity firms are taxed. Lawmakers also decided to preserve a tax break important to many manufacturers to help ensure passage. The buyback tax is expected to raise enough to offset both those changes, and other Democrats didn't object to it.</p><p>Buybacks have drawn fire since at least the aftermath of the financial crisis, as some lawmakers criticized companies for returning cash to shareholders instead of reinvesting it or raising wages. Some also argue that buybacks can help boost executive pay.</p><p>\"I hate stock buybacks,\" Sen. Schumer said at a Friday press conference on the legislation. \"I think they're one of the most self-serving things that Corporate America does instead of investing in workers and in training and in research and in equipment.\"</p><p>Republicans cast the measure as harmful to Americans saving for retirement, given the huge quantities of stock they own, arguing that the measure would raise companies' compliance costs.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted its opposition to the buyback tax, saying it would \"distort the efficient movement of capital to where it can be put to best use and will diminish the value of Americans' retirement savings.\"</p>",
