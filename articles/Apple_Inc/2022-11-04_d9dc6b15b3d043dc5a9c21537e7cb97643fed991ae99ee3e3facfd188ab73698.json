  "text": "<p>   Writing in support of Rep. Dan Crenshaw's call to overcome disunity within the GOP (\"A Time for Choosing for Republicans,\" op-ed, Oct. 28), former Secretary of State James Baker says the following: \"Rep. Dan Crenshaw is spot-on about the future of the Republican Party and our nation\" (Letters, Nov. 1). </p><p>   Mr. Crenshaw lays the blame for disunity on those who consider themselves \"populists, nationalists, MAGA, mainstream\" and \"opportunists . . . quick to label anyone and everyone a 'RINO' or 'establishment sell-out.'\" </p><p>   In thinly veiled language, Messrs. Crenshaw and Baker indicate their disapproval of those who fault most Republicans in office for failing to stop or slow down the increasingly progressive (socialist) agenda of the Democrats. </p><p>   In other words, the problem is the upstarts who are dissatisfied with the old guard. This doesn't sound like a very unifying message. </p><p>   John Moore </p><p>   Wilbraham, Mass. </p><p></p>",
