  "title": "Take-Two buys gaming group Zynga in $12.7bn deal",
  "text": "<p>Take-Two Interactive, the company behind the popular <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game series, has agreed a $12.7bn deal to buy mobile gaming specialist Zynga, the maker of <em>FarmVille </em>and <em>Words with Friends</em>.</p> <p>The cash-and-shares deal values Zynga's equity at $9.86 per share, a premium of 64 per cent to its closing price on Friday. Under the terms of the transaction announced on Monday, Zynga shareholders will receive $3.50 in cash and $6.36&#xa0;in Take-Two stock for each of their shares. </p> <p>The companies said the combination would allow them to better compete with large traditional gaming incumbents such as Activision Blizzard and EA, which have also been buying new assets to expand their mobile offerings.</p> <p>Take-Two said the acquisition of Zynga would establish it “as one of the largest publishers of mobile games, the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry”.</p> <p>Take-Two chief executive Strauss Zelnick will lead the combined group. Zynga chief executive Frank Gibeau and its president of publishing, Bernard Kim, will be in charge of Take-Two's mobile business and will oversee the integration of the two companies. Zynga will also have two out of the 10 seats on Take-Two's board of directors.</p> <p>Together, the two companies generate $6.1bn in annual revenues, according to a statement by Take-Two. </p> <p>Zynga had been on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46c3a499-8cca-4ca5-a9ea-34e1b503afec\">acquisition spree</a> in recent months as it aimed to capitalise on the gaming boom that was accelerated by pandemic-induced lockdowns, as well as expand into games that can be played on multiple devices. </p> <p>In 2020, the San Francisco-based company bought Turkey's Peak Games for $1.8bn. Last year, it acquired game studio Echtra Games. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. </p> <p>In May, Zynga bought advertising technology company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a02330bc-85cd-4ad7-a7b3-7e91fb6bdd0d\">Chartboost for $250m</a>, bringing its ability to personalise game ads in-house after Apple changed its privacy and tracking rules. </p> <p>The decision to combine comes as other larger gaming companies invest heavily in mobile gaming. Activision Blizzard, which is behind&#xa0;<em>Call of Duty</em>, acquired&#xa0;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em>&#xa0;maker King in 2015 for $5.9bn. EA bought Glu Mobile, which is best known for its game involving an animated Kim Kardashian, for&#xa0;$2.4bn in 2021, and Codemasters, which has a roster of racing games including <em>F1</em>, for $1.2bn in 2020.</p> <p>Zynga's shares surged 52 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.</p> <p>*<em>This story has been amended since first publication to correct the value of Take-Two stock that Zynga shareholders will receive. </em></p><p>Source: Leke Oso Alabi and Nikou Asgari in London, James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2022 'Take-Two buys gaming group Zynga in $12.7bn deal' FT.com 10 January.
