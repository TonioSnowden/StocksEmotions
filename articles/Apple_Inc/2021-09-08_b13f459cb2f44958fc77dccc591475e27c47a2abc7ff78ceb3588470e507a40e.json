  "text": "<p>The Future of Everything covers the innovation and technology transforming the way we live, work and play, with monthly issues on education, money, cities and more. This month is Health, online starting Sept. 3 and in the paper on Sept. 10.</p><p>Saad Alam, a 39-year-old founder of a biotech startup and self-described fitness fanatic from Jersey City, N.J., started experiencing fatigue and low sex drive when he was 35. After a series of tests, he found that he had \"the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old man,\" he says, a revelation that sent his girlfriend into a panic.</p><p>Now, he says, he has frozen sperm samples with five different companies as a way of making sure his genetics remain viable in multiple locations. Mr. Alam believes that his generation could live to be 110 or 120 years old, which he says \"fundamentally changes how you think about the arc of your life,\" and when to have children.</p><p>\"My girlfriend keeps asking me when we're going to have kids, when we're going to have kids, but I work crazy hours and I love building companiesâ€”I'm not necessarily ready for kids right now,\" Mr. Alam says. \"This is like my insurance policy.\"</p><p>For decades, the conversation about waning fertility has been focused largely on women. Think of Marisa Tomei stomping on the floorboards of a front porch to emulate her biological clock ticking in \"My Cousin Vinny.\" More employers cover the cost of cryogenic egg freezing as a workplace benefit.</p><p>Recently, a small group of biotech startups have hatched, dedicated to what they say is an underserved market: male fertility. Armed with recent scientific research suggesting that the quality of sperm is declining in the West, the companies are trying to make sperm-freezing a routine procedure for young, healthy men, one covered by health insurance and free of stigma.</p><p>\"My fundamental belief is that if the product is affordable, this should be a no-brainer for every man,\" says Khaled Kteily, the 32-year-old founder of Legacy Inc., one of the companies that Mr. Alam used to freeze his sperm. \"I believe that in the future,\" he adds, \"this will be something that parents will buy for their kids as a not-so-subtle gift.\"</p><p>The push to make a case for its business is starting to catch on. The company recently struck a deal to eventually provide free sperm testing and storage to all active duty service members in the U.S. military, starting with the Navy SEALs, of which there are about 1,200 a year, and expanding next to all special operations forces. The Navy didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Soldiers regularly experience risky situations and time away from their partners, says Ellen Gustafson, a Navy wife and co-founder of the Military Family Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for coverage of fertility medicine for members of the armed forces. \"We want to give this group of men access to this technology, as a way of saying, if you do this early in your career, it can really alleviate a big mental burden that a lot of people carry as service members,\" she says.</p><p>Legacy's roots date back to five years ago, when Mr. Kteily, then working as a management consultant, experienced a painful accident. While riding in a car, he spilled scalding hot tea on his lap, singing his genitals and leaving him terrified that he would be left sterile. A few months later, he went to a sperm bank and gave a sample for analysis. His fertility levels were normal, and a nurse asked him if he would like to pay $500 a year to store the sample in a deep-freeze.</p><p>It was the steep price tag and the impersonal experience of visiting the clinic that inspired Mr. Kteily to start his own company. Legacy now offers at-home sperm sample collection kits that customers send back to the company by mail for analysis and cryogenic storage. The company charges about $200 for sperm analysis and between $100 and $150 a year for storage, and pricing goes down for bundles.</p><p>Since its founding in 2018, the company has sent out more than 5,000 kits and expanded services into fertility and lifestyle counseling. Mr. Kteily expects revenue this year to be between $5 million and $10 million. About 60% of revenue comes from testing, the remainder from storage services, he says.</p><p>Customers range from young single men who aren't ready for romantic commitment or are worried about the possibility of life-altering accidents to couples experiencing difficulties getting pregnant to cancer patients to transgender people looking to preserve their fertility before beginning hormone therapy.</p><p>A bigger role in reproduction</p><p>A host of recent research suggests that men's reproductive health plays a bigger role in reproduction than previously thought.</p><p>In 2017, a metastudy that examined data from semen samples provided by roughly 42,000 men and was published in the journal Human Reproductive Update, came to a worrisome conclusion: Between 1973 and 2011, sperm counts in men in western countries fell 52%, from an average of about 99 million cells per milliliter of semen to about 47 million. A reading of below 40 million sperm cells per milliliter indicates that a man is \"subfertile,\" meaning that conceiving a child will take longer than average.</p><p>The rapid rate of decline raises fears that if men's fertility continues to fall, sperm preservation will be the only option for men who don't have children during their prime years, before age 35, says Shanna Swan, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who studies the effects of environmental health on reproduction and was lead author of the 2017 paper.</p><p>\"It's a global crisis, and sperm count is the canary in the coal mine,\" Dr. Swan says, noting that young people are waiting longer to have families and environmental factors such as chemical pollutants can reduce women's fertility. \"The human race is threatened, and we have to do something quickly.\"</p><p>Other recent research has raised additional new concerns about the fragility of men's fertility. One 2019 Danish study found a higher risk of psychiatric and developmental disorders such as schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder among babies born to fathers aged 45 compared with aged 25.</p><p>This year, an American Society of Reproductive Medicine metastudy that examined 77,000 cases of in vitro fertilization found that when controlled for a mother's age, sperm from men over the age of 45 had a lower chance of causing a pregnancy using IVF.</p><p>The 'hidden topic' of male fertility</p><p>Still, this message doesn't seem to have resonated with men, especially younger men, says William Matthews, a former executive at Playboy Enterprises and founder of Fellow, another sperm-testing and storage startup that competes with Legacy.</p><p>\"We have a system in place where women start going to a gynecologist in their teens, but for men, fertility and infertility are sort of hidden topics,\" says Marcia Inhorn, a medical anthropologist at Yale University who studies reproduction and fertility. \"It doesn't become a big issue for them until they're having trouble getting someone pregnant.\"</p><p>If marriage age continues to rise in the U.S., and more scientific study is done on men's role in reproduction, it could encourage men to learn more about their own fertility and perhaps make use of services like sperm-freezing, says Peter Gray, an anthropologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and co-author of the book \"Fatherhood: Evolution and Human Paternal Behavior.\" Still, this won't happen overnight.</p><p>\"It would have to be more and more women delaying childbearing until their late 30s, and having children with partners slightly older, on a large scale, in order for this issue to capture more of men's attention,\" Mr. Gray says.</p><p>Sperm-freezing: An employment benefit?</p><p>Starting a few years ago, corporations, including big tech firms like Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc., started offering cryogenic egg-freezing to female employees as a healthcare perk. Some praised the effort for allowing young women to focus on their careers even during their prime childbearing years, while others thought it sent the wrong message: that having children and working hard were incompatible goals.</p><p>Legacy hopes that large corporations will start paying for men to freeze their sperm too. Already, the company's sperm analysis and storage services are covered by some health insurers in New York and California, which means around 20 million men in the U.S. have plans that cover their sperm testing and freezing services, Mr. Kteily says. The company plans to expand in Illinois and Texas next.</p><p>The company's customers include Stephen Doyle, a 31-year-old respiratory therapist who lives with his wife in Mebane, N.C. The couple has been trying to get pregnant for six years, and recently found out that Mr. Doyle's sperm count is low and has low motility, or movement capability. Mr. Doyle froze his sperm with Legacy and underwent lifestyle counseling.</p><p>\"It's kind of a crushing moment when you experience that, and it was one of those things where, it was, can I be fixed? Is there any solution?\" Mr. Doyle says. \"It's nice to have someone who feels like they're rooting for you.\"</p><p>Another target market for Legacy is transgender people. A 26-year-old software engineer and transgender woman from Seattle, who uses they as a pronoun, is taking feminizing hormones as part of their transition. They found out from a doctor that after six months of hormone therapy, they would likely be infertile.</p><p>They have long wanted to have a baby daughter, so they stored a sperm sample with Legacy for five years.</p><p>\"My fertility is going down as we speak because I started transitioning, which was an emotional and physical priority for me,\" they say. \"I didn't want to degrade anymore and descend further into depression. The more effective my treatment is, the sooner my fertility starts to vanish.\"</p><p>Each kit that Legacy sends to clients contains preservative chemicals that the customer mixes with a semen sample, then mails back to the company using a commercial courier.</p><p>Most samples end up at a lab in San Antonio, where the company says it runs a series of tests that analyze sperm count, motility and morphology, or the shape of sperm cells. Then customers get a report about their sperm quality and the options for storage and counseling.</p><p>Felipe Navarette, Legacy's head of research, says he is trying to develop assays that test the impact of lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption on sperm quality, which could then be tested again to evaluate the effects of lifestyle changes, an opportunity for more revenue for Legacy. The company is also trying to come up with a test that produces a percentage likelihood for successful conception.</p><p>Mr. Kteily and other executives at the company are also lobbying Congress to expand coverage of infertility treatments among military veterans and applying for more public funding to study male fertility themselves, a research area they say has been largely ignored.</p><p>\"This subject is a black box for a lot of society,\" says Ramy Ghayda, a urologist and Legacy's chief medical officer. \"We're trying to shatter all the taboos surrounding male fertility.\"</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>With Fertility Needs in Flux, Men Eye Freezing Their Sperm</p>",
