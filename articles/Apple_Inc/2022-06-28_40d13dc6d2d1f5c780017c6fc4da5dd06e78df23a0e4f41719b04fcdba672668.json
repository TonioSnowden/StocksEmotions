  "title": "U.S. News:  FBI Seizes Phone of Trump Lawyer Eastman  ----  By Sadie Gurman",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Federal agents have seized the phone of John Eastman, a conservative lawyer and key figure in then-President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election, according to a Monday court filing, in the latest signal that the Justice Department is ramping up its criminal investigation into that effort. </p><p>   Federal Bureau of Investigation agents acting on behalf of the Justice Department's inspector general stopped Mr. Eastman and took the iPhone as he was leaving a restaurant on Wednesday, he wrote in a motion filed in New Mexico seeking to recover the device from the government. </p><p>   The same day, federal agents searched the Northern Virginia home of Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who promised to help Mr. Trump's efforts to reverse his election loss by pressuring the agency to promote his false claims of widespread election fraud. The agents took into their possession all of Mr. Clark's electronic devices, he later said. </p><p>   The seizures offered some of the clearest indications yet that prosecutors investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have moved beyond the violence on the day the election results were set to be certified and are examining the actions of senior officials involved in Mr. Trump's efforts to stay in office. </p><p>   The Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said shortly after the riot in January 2021 that his office was investigating whether department officials \"engaged in an improper attempt\" to overturn President Biden's victory. At the time Mr. Horowitz said the investigation would \"encompass all allegations that may arise that are within the scope\" of his office's jurisdiction. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department's inspector general declined to comment. </p><p>   Mr. Eastman, a former constitutional law professor, was the architect of strategies to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential contest. His role in Mr. Trump's campaign to persuade then-Vice President Mike Pence to interfere in the certification of the election results has been a focus of hearings by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack. </p><p>   Mr. Eastman said in his motion that the office of the inspector general had \"outstripped [its] mandate by targeting a person outside of the Department of Justice\" and said the search warrant used to take the phone \"does not describe with particularity the items to be seized, is overbroad, and provides no probable cause link to any suspected criminal activity.\" </p><p></p>",
