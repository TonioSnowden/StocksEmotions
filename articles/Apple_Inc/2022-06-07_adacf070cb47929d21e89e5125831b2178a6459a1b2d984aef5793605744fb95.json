Target, ahead of the opening bell, announced a plan to reduce its inventory and revised its operating margin guidance.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates sharply to quell surging inflation, with the economy tipping into an early recession in the 1980s.</p><p>\"Many are interpreting this finding as implying that the task facing Powell is almost as severe as the task that faced Volcker, that a similar amount of hawkish restraint — relative to today's neutral policy setting — might be required to do so, and that this would almost certainly end in recession,\" said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. Guha said his opinion is that Powell's task is not as difficult as Volcker's in the 1980s.</p><p>Meanwhile, the World Banksharply downgraded its outlook for the global economy, pointing to Russia's war against Ukraine, the prospect of widespread food shortages and concerns about the potential return of \"stagflation\" — a toxic mix of high inflation and sluggish growth unseen for more than four decades.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Kohl's Corp.
