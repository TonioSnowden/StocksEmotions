  "text": "<p>An apology was always likely to preface <em>Emancipation</em>, the brawny drama of American slavery presented as a comeback for star Will Smith. And yet, in the end, the mea culpa came from co-producer Joey McFarland. At last week's premiere in Los Angeles, McFarland (who is white) caused surprise by pulling from his pocket a fragile historical artefact: an 1863 photograph of the slave whose escape the film is based on. He was known as “Whipped Peter”, his back a nightmarish mass of scars. Now, McFarland said, he owned the original. It was, he explained, part of his “collection”.</p> <p>Controversy ensued, of course, not least at the photograph seeming to become a prop in an expensive promo campaign funded by backers Apple. Public contrition followed. But the episode still captures something of the essence of the project: a historical image of vast gravity, piggybacked by film-makers prone to unwise decisions.</p> <p>Director Antoine Fuqua, the two-fisted stylist best known for 2001 cop thriller <em>Training Day</em>, here works in black-and-white or thereabouts. (The effect is actually desaturated colour, like a Snapchat filter.) We open with a God's-eye view of a Louisiana cotton field, the crop a snowy dazzle. A first act of wrenching violence follows. In the thick of the civil war, Smith's Peter is taken from a plantation to lay railway tracks for the Confederacy. Barbarism reigns in a hellish mudscape. Among the overseers is a Kurtzian slave hunter, played by Ben Foster. The role will call to mind Barry Jenkins's outstanding streaming series <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34d76d42-eaba-4179-a18d-bfc544bdca44\"><em>The Underground Railroad</em></a>.</p> <p>Jenkins's tour de force is only the highest bar from among the previous stories of slavery told by US film and television. Why another? For the same reason there are still films about the first world war or the Holocaust: because this is what people are capable of. But if Fuqua confronts us with that horror, his endless drone shots and slo-mo flourishes also put a jarring, action-movie sheen on it. When Peter escapes the railway camp into swampland, the film morphs into a survivalist epic. Smith is shortly doing battle with an alligator. (Sometimes, there is not much a review can add.)</p> <p>Ahead of release, the chatter around <em>Emancipation</em> concerned the fate of Smith's career after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865abe4f-d3f3-4861-96b5-b2a6d6253854\">this year's much-discussed Oscar ceremony</a>. Your thoughts on the subject may recede watching the movie, partly due to Fuqua's tonal bedlam, but mostly because the star is still exactly that: a gifted screen performer. The problem with Smith isn't his presence. It's what the film does with it. The script leaves Peter a cipher, unimagined beyond the demands of the plot: suffer, fight alligators, seek a reunion with a family written as stick figures.</p> <p>The frustration comes when, in fleeting moments, <em>Emancipation</em> becomes a better film. At different points, two haunting scenes involve children. One unfolds to the eerie strum of a harp. In another, the sweet-faced daughter of a genteel white family calls out in fury at the sight of Peter, summoning adults and a shotgun. Here, however briefly, are images not dwarfed by the original 1863 photograph. “We're going to make sure everybody in the world knows what slavery truly looks like,” 19th-century abolitionists announce. And who could fail to hear the modern film-makers telling themselves the same, as they step out on the red carpet?</p> <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas and on Apple TV Plus from December 9</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Emancipation film review — the problem with Will Smith's comeback movie' FT.com 8 December.
