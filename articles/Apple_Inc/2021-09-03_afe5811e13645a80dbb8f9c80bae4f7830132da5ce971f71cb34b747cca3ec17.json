  "title": "App Store Faces Fights in Court, Legislatures  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Even after a week of tweaks to the Apple Inc. App Store, the core fight over the iPhone maker's market power remains for a federal judge and lawmakers in Brussels and Washington to decide. </p><p>   The moves so far have appeased some. Japan's antitrust enforcer will drop its investigation into Apple as part of a deal announced late Wednesday. The company agreed to allow certain types of companies to include links within their apps for the first time to allow users to sign up on websites. The change makes it possible to bypass its payment system and, in turn, Apple's ability to capture a cut of the revenue. Another proposed deal announced last week to settle a class-action lawsuit by smaller developers would allow apps to communicate with users outside of the app about alternative payment methods for their services. </p><p>   These agreements, however, don't address the major complaints by bigger rivals such as Spotify Technology SA and \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games Inc., which have accused Apple of misusing its power over the iPhone ecosystem to unfairly disadvantage third-party developers. </p><p>   Spotify's complaints in Europe helped lead the European Union's top antitrust enforcer to charge Apple this year with abusing its control over streaming-music apps. Epic has sued Apple in U.S. federal court in a case that is expected to have a ruling soon. Apple has denied wrongdoing in both matters. </p><p>   \"This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't solve the problem,\" Daniel Ek, Spotify founder and chief executive, said Thursday on Twitter of Apple's latest change. \"App developers want clear, fair rules that apply to all apps. Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time. We will continue to push for a real solution.\" </p><p>   Spotify said the recent settlement doesn't address concerns such as Apple's requirement that developers use its in-app payment system, which charges as much as 30%. </p><p>   Epic has argued that users should be allowed to download competing stores or apps directly onto their phones outside of Apple's digital store. </p><p>   Lawmakers in Congress and the European Union are considering measures that would require Apple to allow such practices. Apple has said that could open users up to security threats. </p><p>   \"Apple should open up iOS on the basis of hardware, stores, payments, and services each competing individually on their merits,\" Tim Sweeney, Epic co-founder and CEO said on Twitter late Wednesday. \"Instead, they're running a literally day-by-day recalculation of divide-and-conquer in hopes of getting away with most of their practices.\" </p><p>   Spotify, Epic and other developers have criticized Apple's rules preventing them from directly communicating with users with targeted information obtained with the app, such as an email address. Apple's changes last week were aimed at that issue. </p><p>   The changes announced by Apple in recent days should have little effect on the company's bottom line. The deal with the Japanese, which will be rolled out globally early next year, affects apps that sell digital content or subscriptions such as newspapers, music and video, like Spotify and Netflix Inc. </p><p>   Those specific companies weren't offering subscriptions through their Apple apps. Instead, customers had to manage those purchases through the companies' websites, which could be a cumbersome process. </p><p>   Apple appears to be walking a line between trying to appease some now with small changes and protecting its business from larger threats down the road. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" said Sam Weinstein, a law professor at Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University and former antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department, who has been following legal challenges to how Apple runs its business. \"This might help them in some ways but it might be seen by itself as a concession.\" </p><p>   The rules date to the days of the late Steve Jobs, who championed Apple's \"walled garden\" approach of keeping firm control over third-party offerings for the company's iPhones and iPad tablets. </p><p>   The rules over content and in-app payment system requirements have helped safeguard users, Apple has argued, while also creating a revenue driver for the company's service business. </p><p>   During the near monthlong trial with Epic, the judge deciding the case questioned Apple's rules prohibiting apps from directing customers to outside methods of payment that could be cheaper. Wednesday's change wouldn't affect apps such as \"Fortnite.\" </p><p>   The judge's statement had led some close observers to suspect that Apple might eventually need to change its antisteering rules. </p><p></p>",
