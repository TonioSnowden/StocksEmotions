  "text": "<p>2022 Toyota Corolla</p><p>Toyota2022 Toyota Corolla&#xa0;starting price:&#xa0;$20,075</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Reputation for reliability; numerous safety features; optional powertrains including a hybrid; both sedan and hatchback body styles.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;CVT transmission; small trunk; tight rear seat.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;Reliable, safe, and offered as both a sedan and a hatchback, the 2022 Toyota Corolla is a rock-solid choice for a compact. It's not the most exciting thing to drive, however, and front-wheel drive is the only option.</p><p>More on the Corolla: This humble car has quietly reached a major milestone</p><p>And: This is the hybrid car that will cost you the least over 5 years</p><p>2022 Nissan Sentra</p><p>2022 Nissan Sentra&#xa0;starting price:&#xa0;$19,510</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Comfortable cabin; good standard equipment; pleasant driving experience.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Power; one engine choice; only available in sedan form; CVT transmission; thick rear pillars impede outward vision.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;A stylish compact sedan, the 2022 Nissan Sentra is comfortable and well-equipped, with good standard driver-assistance features. Only a single engine is available, and the Sentra isn't terribly fun to drive.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:These are the most important things to check on a stock's quote page before deciding whether to buy or sell</p><p>Corolla vs. Sentra: comfort or choice</p><p>Toyota Corolla</p><p>It's almost hard to imagine a world without the Toyota Corolla, which has been a world-wide bestseller through 12 generations and several decades. It has succeeded by being extremely reliable, spacious, and well-equipped at a reasonable price. It also offers variety, as the 2022 Corolla is also available as a hatchback and a hybrid.</p><p>Aside from the hybrid, it features two gas engines: a simple 1.8-liter 4-cylinder, and a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. The base engine gets the Corolla around, but that's about it. In the upper-trim SE and XSE models, the 2.0-liter is paired with a sport suspension, making the Corolla considerably more lively, although no one would ever mistake it for a sports car. The SE actually has an optional 6-speed manual for more involved driving.</p><p>See: 10 top cars of the year</p><p>Inside, the sedan provides a respectable 34.8 inches of legroom in the back as well as 13.1 cubic feet of cargo space. The hatchback is down considerably on rear-seat space, with a mere 29.9 inches of rear legroom. The dash is tidy and clean, and the materials are perfectly pleasant. Cloth seats are standard, with simulated leather in the top XLE trim.</p><p>Standard features include Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto integration as well as Amazon Alexa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and a 7-inch touchscreen. Safety features are excellent and include 10 airbags, forward-collision warning with automatic braking, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control.</p><p>Nissan Sentra</p><p>In the world of compact sedans, the 2022 Nissan Sentra is a bit of an also-ran. It's not that there's anything wrong with the Sentra, which is comfortable and perfectly pleasant. But the segment is a fierce one, and many better choices are available.</p><p>The biggest drawback is the sole engine choice, a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder making a mere 149 horsepower and driving the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Power is adequate, but that's about it. The ride is comfortable and compliant, however, with the Sentra boasting a sophisticated rear suspension.</p><p>More: Cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans: 18 best buys</p><p>Things are better inside, with a roomy and comfortable cabin. The legroom is ample and materials are good, with base cloth upholstery ranging up to simulated or real leather on the higher trims. Trunk space is also respectable. A thick rear pillar impedes rear visibility, although blind-spot monitoring comes standard.</p><p>Considering its under-$20,000 price point, standard features in Sentra are impressive. All trims include Nissan's safety suite known as Safety Shield 360, which includes forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and rear automatic emergency braking. A 7-inch touchscreen comes with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, Bluetooth, four speakers, and two USB ports. It's worth noting that the base trim also comes with rear drum brakes, although discs are standard on the higher trims.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Front-drive; 4-cylinder power; base fuel economy; NHTSA 5-star safety ratings.</p><p>2022 Toyota Corolla advantages</p><p>Optional hatchback; optional hybrid; better resale; better reliability.</p><p>2022 Nissan Sentra advantages</p><p>Starting price; more cargo space; more passenger space.</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>For just over $20,000, the 2022 Toyota Corolla is a reliable and practical sedan (or hatchback) offering a couple of different engines including a fuel-efficient hybrid.</p><p>Don't miss:These are the cars that cost the most and least to insure</p><p>While it's not as fun to drive, the 2022 Nissan Sentra is roomy, comfortable, and has a good-sized trunk for your stuff. It also has some of the best seats in the business.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2022 Toyota Corolla                                2022 Nissan Sentra  Popular Powertrains:  Engine                       1.8-liter I4                                       2.0-liter I4  Horsepower                   139 hp @ 6,100 rpm                                 149 hp @ 6,400 rpm  Torque                       126 lb-ft @ 3,900 rpm                              146 lb-ft @ 4,400 rpm  Transmission                 CVT                                                CVT  Fuel Economy                 33 mpg (30 city/38 hwy)                            33 mpg (29 city/39 hwy)  Also Available               2.0-liter I4; 1.8-liter I4 hybrid; 6-speed manual  n/a  Specs:  Basic warranty               3 years/ 36,000 miles                              3 years/36,000 miles  Powertrain Warranty          5 years/ 60,000 miles                              5 years/60,000 miles  NHTSA Overall Safety Rating  5 stars                                            5 stars  Max Seating Capacity         5                                                  5  Wheelbase                    106.3 inches                                       106.8 inches  Overall Length               182.3 inches                                       182.7 inches  Width                        70.1 inches                                        71.5 inches  Height                       56.5 inches                                        56.9 inches  Turning Diameter             35.6 feet                                          38.1 feet  Headroom, Front              38.3 inches                                        38.9 inches  Headroom, Rear               37.1 inches                                        36.7 inches  Legroom, Front               42.0 inches                                        44.0 inches  Legroom, Rear                34.8 inches                                        37.4 inches  Shoulder Room, Front         54.0 inches                                        56.4 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear          51.7 inches                                        54.5 inches  EPA Passenger Volume         89.0 cubic feet                                    96.0 cubic feet  EPA Cargo Volume             13.1 cubic feet                                    14.3 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
