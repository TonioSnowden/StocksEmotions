  "title": "Technology:  Spotify Launches  Audiobook Service  In Push to Expand  ----  By Anne Steele and Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg",
  "text": "<p>   Spotify Technology SA began offering audiobooks on Tuesday as the streaming giant aims to expand beyond music and podcasts. </p><p>   Spotify users can purchase and listen to a catalog of more than 300,000 audiobooks from independent authors and major publishers, including titles by horror writer Stephen King, journalist Malcolm Gladwell and romance novelist Abby Jimenez. </p><p>   The books are available on a pay-per-download basis, similar to existing audiobook services such as those offered by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. While Spotify is known for its user-specific music recommendations -- and is working on building that out for podcasts as well -- it will make editorially curated recommendations for audiobooks to start. The company said it would work to add algorithmic recommendations, based on the full scope of a user's listening habits, over time. </p><p>   Spotify last fall announced its acquisition of global audiobook distributor Findaway, mounting a challenge to the country's largest audiobook service, Audible, a unit of Amazon.com Inc. The deal closed in June. </p><p>   Spotify sells its titles at individual prices and said it is setting those prices and negotiating terms directly with publishers. Audible offers a subscription service where users pay a fee to get access to its 760,000 audiobooks and other content, including its own originals. Audible controlled about 48% of U.S. audiobook unit sales for the monthly period ended mid-April, according to book-audience researcher Codex Group LLC. </p><p>   Spotify's vice president and head of audiobooks, Nir Zicherman, said the company is exploring different business models, including ad-supported and subscriptions, as well as exclusive titles. Spotify said the offering, launched in the U.S. only on Tuesday, will eventually roll out to other markets. </p><p>   Spotify, which has been fighting Apple over its in-app purchase policies, said users will be directed to make audiobook purchases via a web browser instead of inside the app -- a move that means Apple won't be taking up to a 30% commission for downloads. </p><p>   During Spotify's investor day in June, Chief Executive Daniel Ek highlighted audiobooks as a key expansion area as part of his vision to expand the company to 10 times its current size. Mr. Ek said he believes the overall audiobook market could drive $70 billion in annual revenue, and margins over 40% for the Spotify unit. </p><p>   Mr. Zicherman said audiobooks represent 6% to 7% of the book market globally but are growing by 20% year-over-year. </p><p>   Shares in the Stockholm-based company closed down 2.5% Tuesday. </p><p></p>",
