  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>\"The Big Conn,\" a likable, four-part AppleTV+ series, tells the story of Eric C. Conn, who masterminded what is probably the biggest rip-off in the history of the Social Security Administration—$550 million, gained through fraudulently processed disability claims out of eastern Kentucky. Is it a Robin Hood story? Not overtly. But Conn is a charming rogue; the people who profited from his long-running and very lucrative scheme weren't necessarily not entitled to the money; and as one accomplice told a Wall Street Journal reporter, \"A lot of people around here don't have more than a fourth-grade education and couldn't get a job if their lives depended on it.\" Without actually going there, directors James Lee Hernandez and Brian Lazarte—the makers of another entertaining/enlightening scamster story (\"McMillion$\")—look to find some fun in fungible morality, without ignoring the fact that there were victims involved.</p><p>Conn was, after all, an ever-smiling, larger-than-life figure, one that locals in Pikeville, Ky., describe as inescapable: His face and his pitch—to get people their disputed SSI disability benefits without months of waiting—were everywhere. In Los Angeles, his face would have been on bus-stop benches; in New York, on the subway. In Kentucky, it was billboards; as one Conn colleague says, if you asked 10 people on a Pikeville street who the president was, nine would know; 10 would know Eric C. Conn. Popular and camera-friendly, the lawyer lived ostentatiously and expensively. As a dryly funny former Conn associate, Mason Tackett, puts it, people would ask, \"Is he selling drugs?\" No, Mr. Tackett quips, \"He's selling SSI.\"</p><p>Despite being set upon the rather parched storytelling landscape of financial chicanery, \"The Big Conn\" is infectiously engaging, the directors using copious re-enactments, graphics and solid interviews that never run aground, keeping our attention afloat amid a sea of fraud and bureaucratic minutiae. The two most inspiring participants are Sarah Carver and Jennifer Griffith, employees of the Social Security office in Huntington W.Va., where the Conn clients' claims were processed, and who spent years informing their superiors about the suspicious link between Conn and an administrative judge named David Daugherty. As explained by former Wall Street Journal reporter Damian Paletta, whose original story broke open the case, Daugherty had an approval rate of more than 97% regarding the appeals that came before him, and most of what came before him were Conn clients—their paperwork at any rate.</p><p>Mr. Paletta is almost apologetic for having been involved in the case—at the time, his beat was national security and intelligence in Washington and he never expected to be drawn into the kind of investigative journalism the Conn story required. Ms. Carver and Ms. Griffith, who recount the intimidation and harassment they suffered for having been whistleblowers, are the kind of people who grow only more determined in the face of an obvious bureaucratic coverup. Whither Conn? That would be a spoiler, but Messrs. Hernandez and Lazarte recount the entire tale with considerably more zeal and alacrity than what the government displayed toward a rather obvious picking of its pocket.</p><p>'The Big Conn Review: Giving People Money</p>",
