  "title": "Technology:  Samsung  Forecasts  28% Rise  In Profit  ----  By Timothy W. Martin",
  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. is forecasting a 28% jump in third-quarter operating profit, the latest reminder of how the world-wide semiconductor shortage has turned out to be a financial boon for chip makers. </p><p>   The world's largest smartphone and memory-chip maker is projecting operating profit of 15.8 trillion South Korean won, equivalent to about $13.3 billion, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares with about 12.35 trillion won for the year-earlier quarter. </p><p>   The Suwon-based firm estimates revenue of 73 trillion won, a 9% gain from a year ago. </p><p>   Analysts estimates gathered by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence were about 15.7 trillion won in operating profit and 73.4 trillion won in revenue. </p><p>   Samsung is due to report full earnings later this month. The company is considered a bellwether for the tech world because it makes major electronics products, while also serving as a components supplier to competitors including Apple Inc. </p><p>   Samsung and other chip giants have seen their pricing power increase, as a pandemic-fueled surge in demand for semiconductors has created widespread shortages. Global businesses had hoped the supply crunch might dissipate by year-end. But the shortages look likely to extend into 2022, if not longer. </p><p>   The chip industry is on a major investment spree. Intel Corp. recently said it would build new chip-making facilities in Europe valued at as much as $95 billion, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has said it would spend a record $100 billion over the next three years to increase production capacity. </p><p>   Samsung said it plans to boost investments by one-third to more than $205 billion over the next three years, in part to pursue leadership in chip manufacturing. </p><p></p>",
