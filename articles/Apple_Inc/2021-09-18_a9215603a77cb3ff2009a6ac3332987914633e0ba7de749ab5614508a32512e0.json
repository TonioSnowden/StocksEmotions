  "title": "REVIEW --- Word on the Street: A Clothing Fastener Becomes a Virtual Trigger",
  "text": "<p>The one-page ruling left some observers wondering: What exactly counts as a \"button\" in the world of apps on Apple devices? Tim Sweeney, co-founder and chief executive of Epic Games Inc., the plaintiff in the case, playfully asked Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, \"What is a button?\" and posted the results on Twitter: According to Siri, a \"button\" was a \"small fastener used in clothing.\"</p><p>That, of course, is what \"button\" meant long before its digital transformation. \"Button\" comes from the Old French word \"boton,\" ultimately from a root referring to something that pushes up or thrusts out. From the 14th century, the term was used for garment fasteners, as it still is today.</p><p>From that basic meaning, \"button\" got extended to any small, rounded knob, as on a piece of equipment or machinery. In the 19th century, electrical devices started to feature push-buttons that, when depressed, achieved an effect by closing a circuit. Pressing a button on a newfangled device could carry out a task with ease and speed. An 1887 article in The Daily Inter Ocean, a Chicago newspaper, described how the city's chief of police \"took a position at the Central Station telephone, and, at the touch of a button, was ready to bring his whole force under arms in a few hours.\"</p><p>A century later, new technology ushered in a novel sense of the word \"button.\" Starting in the 1980s, \"button\" could refer to a graphical element in a computer display that triggers an event of some sort when it is selected (for instance by clicking a mouse or touching a screen). The earliest example of this usage cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is from an online forum in 1981, describing the Aspen Movie Map, an interactive virtual tour of Aspen, Colorado: \"You press the GO button and your point-of-view starts to move down the street.\"</p><p>Such virtual buttons mimicking older mechanical ones are examples of what is called \"skeuomorphic\" design. From the earliest graphical interfaces, we've grown used to skeuomorphs emulating real-world objects, like a trash bin for deleting files or calendar software that looks like a paper desk calendar. The linguistic counterparts of skeuomorphs are all too common as well, whether we're talking about cleaning up a desktop or filling a shopping cart in an online store.</p><p>Indeed, our language is cluttered with anachronistic words that refer to bygone technologies but linger for newer applications. Think of \"taping\" a program on a tape-less DVR or \"hanging up\" a smartphone that doesn't involve physically placing a handset on a telephone cradle.</p><p>In the case of the \"button\" -- both the word and what it names -- old and new incarnations can coexist happily. Before Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 earlier this week, there were rumors that the model would do away with physical buttons entirely. (The rumors were based on a patent filing suggesting that Apple is exploring inputs that disappear when untouched.) But when the new iPhone made its debut, those external buttons were still there -- along, of course, with the virtual buttons on the screen.</p><p>For now, \"button\" will keep doing semantic double-duty. But as Apple's litigation continues, courts may seek to define the venerable old word for a new generation of button-pushers.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
