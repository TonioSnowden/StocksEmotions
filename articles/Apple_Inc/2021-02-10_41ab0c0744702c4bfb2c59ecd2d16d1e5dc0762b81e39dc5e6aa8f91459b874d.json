  "title": "The NYSE Isn't Moving -- Yet  ----  By Stacey Cunningham",
  "text": "<p>   New York -- The New York Stock Exchange belongs in New York. If Albany lawmakers get their way, however, the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home. </p><p>   On Wednesday, with more than 25 other representatives of New York's securities industry, I sent a letter to state legislative leaders cautioning against the unintended consequences of imposing a transfer tax on stock sales. History's lesson is clear: If you try to squeeze more revenue from financial firms, the business goes elsewhere. </p><p>   The modern NYSE traces its origins to the time when New York City was the nation's capital but not yet the financial capital of the world. Amsterdam held that title before surrendering the torch to London in the early 1800s. New York, and the U.S. more broadly, has been the center of global financial power since the end of World War II, but it shouldn't take its position for granted. </p><p>   Most of the original NYSE listings were New York-based companies, their shares traded by New York-based brokers. Now, the companies and the brokers are global, connected electronically through out-of-state servers, transacting their business instantaneously. These global companies want the NYSE to serve them in the most efficient, least expensive way possible. We've proved, by pandemic-driven necessity, that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment's notice and maintain service without missing a beat. Similarly, the broader financial-services industry shuttered offices and shifted workforces, without hiccups, to remote locations. </p><p>   While New York has remained a center of gravity for the financial industry, many employees of \"Wall Street\" firms are migrating to Florida, Texas and other states with hospitable tax policies. New York's leaders did the right thing in 1981 when they made the state's stock-transfer tax dormant through a 100% rebate. If lawmakers opt to reinstate that tax, the NYSE may need to follow the lead of those relocating firms. Some of our customers are already asking about our willingness to relocate. </p><p>   The NYSE understands what Covid-19 has done to New York. Our headquarters are in Manhattan. Most of our employees live in the region. We own homes, eat at restaurants, and pay our taxes in New York. We all want the city and state to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. That's why we oppose the return of the stock-transfer tax. The last thing we want to do is leave a place we love, especially because of a flawed policy. </p><p>   Financial transaction taxes have a dismal track record. They never live up to the promises about how much revenue they'll raise. They damage capital markets and destroy high-paying jobs. An understanding of these realities recently sunk a similar proposal in New Jersey. </p><p>   In New York, the securities industry generates an estimated 18% of state tax collections. In New York City, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the finance and insurance industries are responsible for 60% of all private-sector wages. Common-sense tax policy helped create this benefit. A stock-transfer tax could destroy it. </p><p>   The stock exchange and Wall Street generally won't bear the burden of the tax. The end investor will ultimately pick up the tab. The levy would be explicitly passed back on customer orders. There is also an implicit cost as market participants forced to pay the tax incorporate it into their prices, raising the prices paid by individual investors. Vanguard estimates that a financial transaction tax of 10 basis points would force retirement-account investors to work roughly 2 1/2 years longer before retiring to reach the same savings goals they might have achieved without the tax. </p><p>   Financial transaction taxes force trading activity to migrate to more efficient markets. This is neither an empty threat nor mere conjecture. When France imposed such taxes in 2012, a third of the trading volume in French public companies moved to London and elsewhere, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Italy introduced one in 2013, resulting in a rise in volatility. When Sweden imposed a financial transactions tax in 1984, volume migrated to London until the tax was rescinded. </p><p>   Proponents think reinstating New York's stock-transfer tax will fill the state's coffers and ease its budget challenges. But the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission said that if it had been collected this past fiscal year, the stock-transfer tax would have yielded only a third of the revenue its advocates estimate: \"In fact, the State would likely amass even less, since firms might avoid the tax by using new technology or relocating the trading portion of their businesses outside New York.\" </p><p>   It doesn't have to be this way. The securities industry should stay in the Big Apple where it belongs. But if New York is to remain the financial capital of the world, it needs to avoid the folly of this tax and show that it truly understands how market forces work. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Cunningham is president of the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p></p>",
