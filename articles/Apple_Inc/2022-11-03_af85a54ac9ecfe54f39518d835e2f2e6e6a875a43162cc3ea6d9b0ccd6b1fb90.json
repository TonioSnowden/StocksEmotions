  "text": "<p>\"Armageddon Time\" is a curiously excitable title for a slice-of-life tale about an ordinary boy growing up in 1980 New York, but then again, 12-year-olds are curiously excitable people. Everything is a discovery; adulthood beckons while childhood limits. The internal push-and-pull provides for ample dramatic possibilities.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Banshees of Inisherin</p><p>Wounded but funny, quiet but resonant and resistant to anything like a Hollywood formula, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is a strangely profound little comedy. It's one of the few true originals among movies this year.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Till</p><p>\"Till\" spares us scenes of the lynching of Emmett Till, but the film is difficult to bear anyway: When confronted with the sight of his coffin, his mother keens with such sorrow that it's piercing and spectral, a wail to reverberate down the ages.</p><p>Poets, songwriters and documentarians have told this horrible story, but Chinonye Chukwu's film, which she co-wrote with Keith Beauchamp and Michael Reilly, gives Till (a cheerfully engaging Jalyn Hall) and especially his mother the Hollywood icon treatment, with all of the emotional potency the big screen delivers like no other medium.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Halloween Ends</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis has been playing Laurie Strode since (the first half of) the Carter administration: Who says there's no more job security in American life? By this point, you'd expect her to have a firm grasp of the part, and she does not disappoint in the largely gripping \"Halloween Ends,\" in which the former scream queen carries an aura of unshakable dignity amid unspeakable carnage. By now, Laurie has survived so much that she is not merely a protagonist but also a sort of one-woman Greek chorus who reflects on the nature of the evil stalking much-menaced Haddonfield, Ill., which is to mass murder what Milwaukee is to beer. It's a pleasure to watch Ms. Curtis exemplify steely courage in a role that once required her to cower and squeal, and her Laurie has become so resourceful that an honest oddsmaker would have to rate her perpetual stalker, the mass-murdering psychopath Michael Myers, a slight underdog in a climactic confrontation with her.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Triangle of Sadness</p><p>Should a woman who makes three times as much as her boyfriend pay for dinner? Can Marxists and capitalists learn anything from each other? More important, what would \"Gilligan's Island\" have been like if it had been directed by Luis Buñuel? Such are the questions raised by writer-director Ruben Östlund in his savagely entertaining social satire \"Triangle of Sadness,\" one of the liveliest and most provocative films of the year.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>All Quiet on the Western Front (Netflix)</p><p>A crash course on World War I might include Stanley Kubrick's \"Paths of Glory,\" Barbara Tuchman's \"The Guns of August,\" Paul Fussell's \"The Great War and Modern Memory,\" and Erich Maria Remarque's \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Based on his own traumatizing experiences as a young German soldier in the trenches of France, Remarque's 1929 novel now gets its first German-language adaptation courtesy of Netflix and director Edward Berger. Fully understanding the war—who does?—may not be necessary in appreciating the disturbing, moving and sometimes too-beautiful production. But that production certainly puts a Teutonic tweak on history, sometimes to outrageous effect.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>God Forbid</p><p>What's perpetrated by \"God Forbid\" isn't exactly bait-and-switch, but this documentary is hardly as tawdry, tacky and sordid as it promises to be. Not that anyone's complaining. But in recounting the notorious 2020 sex scandal involving Jerry Falwell Jr.; his wife, Becki; and their \"pool boy,\" it also takes a deep dive into evangelical politics and how the Christian right came to be what it currently is. Useful information, in other words. Not just dish.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Good Nurse (Netflix)</p><p>As fascinating as they can be to watch, neither Eddie Redmayne nor Jessica Chastain ever has what we usually call chemistry with their co-stars. Their better-known films reflect it: Fewer characters have been more isolated emotionally that Mr. Redmayne's in \"The Danish Girl\" or, intellectually, his Stephen Hawking in \"The Theory of Everything.\" The trademark of Ms. Chastain's performances, from \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" has been a soulful but impenetrable solitude.</p><p>But isolated brilliance is precisely what helps \"The Good Nurse\" shine, and it could hardly be otherwise given the story. A true-crime drama at its core, this psycho thriller-cum-police procedural stars both actors as medical practitioners, one of whom is killing people.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Louis Armstrong: Black and Blues (Apple TV+)</p><p>Like Ernest Hemingway locating the birth of modern American literature in \"Huckleberry Finn,\" Miles Davis found the original incarnation of modern American music—jazz—in Louis Armstrong. \"You can't play anything on a horn that Louis hasn't played,\" said Davis. But like many of Armstrong's practicing black acolytes, Davis was also embarrassed by the man's persona. Too much smiling, too much \"minstrelsy.\" Dizzy Gillespie called him a \"plantation character.\" The image of Armstrong the musical revolutionary was long at war with the image of Armstrong the Uncle Tom.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Peripheral (Prime Video)</p><p>In the 2099 London imagined by \"The Peripheral,\" the Gherkin, the Eye and the Strand have all survived. So has kitsch: A 1,000-foot Venus de Milo shadows Big Ben. (\"Winged Victory\" is elsewhere, along with gargantuan versions of the Discobolus of Myron and the David of Michelangelo). Some institutions seem to have simply vanished: You can rent out Buckingham Palace for company parties, if you can assemble enough humans for a party. Few are around. Whatever has gone on since the year 2032, it hasn't been good.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>TikTok, Boom (PBS)</p><p>One of the ironies in \"TikTok, Boom,\" a scathing look at the Chinese-owned social-media platform, is the fear that TikTok inspires in authoritarian leaders while doing precisely what they'd like to do—disseminate misinformation and stifle dissent. Another is the fact that the people who most need to see this \"Independent Lens\" presentation on PBS probably don't watch TV. They're more likely on TikTok.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Can Psychedelics Cure? (PBS)</p><p>In Woody Allen's 1973 \"Sleeper,\" the comedy's Rip Van Winkle comes from a world where deep fat, steak, cream pie and hot fudge were once thought to be unhealthy—\"precisely the opposite of what we now know to be true,\" says a doctor of the future. The special \"Can Psychedelics Cure?\" asks one question and prompts another: Is everything we're told by science eventually going to be countermanded? We were once assured hallucinogens would make us crazy. Now, they're modern medicine.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Fastest Woman on Earth (HBO Max)</p><p>If you are going to make a biographical documentary, it's certainly no disadvantage to have a subject who is telegenic, charismatic and camera-ready. If you are going to watch a biographical documentary, it's not necessarily a disadvantage to go in knowing nothing at all about the story. And if you are up to speed on \"The Fastest Woman on Earth,\" it's still an engaging, moving and even shocking documentary.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Curse of Bridge Hollow (Netflix)</p><p>\"Bridge Hollow smells like apples,\" says an enthusiastic Howard Gordon (Marlon Wayans), as he drives the family from Brooklyn to their new home in upstate New York, \"with just a hint of white privilege.\" A little provocative for a movie that's more pumpkin spice than critical race theory, but \"The Curse of Bridge Hollow\" is not exactly what one would call forward-thinking: Howard is a science teacher. A believer in the magic of Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Tesla. The ultimate rational man. And the intent of this comedy-thriller is showing how wrong he can be.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Magpie Murders (PBS)</p><p>Bringing new life to the venerable tradition of Sunday Nights With the Brits on PBS, \"Magpie Murders\" might have been a presentation of \"Masterpiece Meta Mystery!\" given how it toys with the genre. Written by Anthony Horowitz and based on his book, the six-part series is not exactly \"Murder on the Disorienting Express,\" though it does put a postmodern spin on Agatha Christie (and Arthur Conan Doyle, with perhaps a potshot at P.D. James). It will prove both novel and irresistible. Also, it stars Lesley Manville.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Let My Children Hear Mingus (PBS)</p><p>One of the great things about \"Let My Children Hear Mingus\" is that it's on television at all, never mind that it opens with about 10 solid minutes of blistering jazz and limits the usual documentary gas-baggery to people who know what they are talking about. What has often been called American classical music is the focus of what is mostly a performance special, a celebration of the centenary of Charles Mingus—bassist, composer, band leader; seminal figure in bebop, hard-bop, post-bop, free jazz and Third Stream music; someone who was politically aware and complicated. That he was an irascible character comes through. So does the compositional glory of several of his pieces.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>I Love You, You Hate Me (Peacock)</p><p>Anyone who's had a child, or been one, is probably familiar with the obsessive-fandom phenomenon: A kid gets totally absorbed by a pop star, a show, or even a TV character, and when the obsession is outgrown the reaction is not just denial but hostility: I never liked them/it/him/her, the kid says—because they're embarrassed at having been the less-discerning person they were.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Let the Right One In (Showtime)</p><p>Eleanor, the ageless, blood-hungry heroine of \"Let the Right One In,\" scampers up the sides of buildings, scrambles like a crab and every now and again goes for the throat. She's agile, flexible and gets under one's skin. Much like the series itself.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Redeem Team (Netflix)</p><p>Knowing the score in advance is no obstacle to reveling in \"The Redeem Team,\" a documentary about motion, emotion, motives and a mission—reclaiming America's supremacy in a sport in which it was becoming a second-rate world power, namely men's Olympic basketball circa 2008. The film may seem to have an impossible mission itself, making NBA millionaires the underdogs in a redemption tale. But by reducing several mythic figures—including Kobe Bryant —to human size, director Jon Weinbach creates a candid team picture with no shortage of virtues.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Mr. Harrigan's Phone (Netflix)</p><p>Stephen King fans will respond immediately to the atmosphere writer-director John Lee Hancock creates at the outset of \"Mr. Harrigan's Phone\"—a world of perpetual autumn and incipient unease, a white-clapboard Maine where the chill gets into the bones and the soul. It will generate such a familiar sensation among fans of Mr. King's fiction and its various adaptations that the effect may well be a Pavlovian dread.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>What to Watch: The 20 Best New Movies and TV Shows From October</p>",
