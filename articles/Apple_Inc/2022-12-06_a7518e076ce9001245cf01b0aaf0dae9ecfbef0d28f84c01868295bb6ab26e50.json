  "text": "<p>Diana, goddess of chastity, appoints three watchmen to help her three nymphs protect her magic apple tree. It is not a brilliant idea. Amor brings some magic arrows and helps nature take its course.</p> <p>We think of Lorenzo Da Ponte as Mozart's librettist, but he wrote for other composers, too — among them Vicente Martín y Soler, who was far more successful than Mozart in his time. Rediscovering his operas today is like meeting the long-lost brother of a close friend — he composed roles for many of Mozart's singers, and Mozart wasn't above borrowing some of his catchier tunes. It all feels oddly familiar.</p> <p><em>L'arbore di Diana</em> (<em>Diana's Tree</em>) is a satirical comedy, a political allegory, and a steamy tale of sex and transgression. If you can shake off the idea of Martín y Soler as a lesser version of Mozart (none of that brilliant complexity, fewer moments of transcendent beauty) and take his music for what it is (crystal clear, marvellously fluent, bursting with melody), you are in for considerable pleasure.</p> <p>Rafael Villalobos's production is a perfect balance of comedy and humanity, superlatively wrought and hugely entertaining. He sets the action in the seedy toilet block of a private high school. Diana is an uptight teacher, her nymphs are the cleaning ladies, the oversexed watchmen are pupils and Amor is the genderfluid ringleader, a male body in female clothing, seductive and self-assured, turning everyone's head. Think Netflix's <em>Sex Education</em> with a hint of <em>Harry Potter</em>'s Moaning Myrtle.</p> <p>The evening's discovery is Israeli male soprano Maayan Licht as Amor. His is a honeyed, extraordinarily agile voice, coupled with a Puck-like physical charisma; Verónica Cangemi is his foil as the conflicted Diana, a role packed with Queen of the Night style vocal fireworks. All six remaining roles are excellently sung. Both Da Ponte's libretto and Martín y Soler's music give each character room to unfold, as sexual tension and corresponding confusion mounts. And Villalobos's production, while screamingly funny, also treats each figure with compassion and empathy.</p> <p>Rubén Dubrovsky conducts this, the first modern production on original instruments, with a solid feel for dramaturgy, and fleet, organic tempi; the Bach Consort Wien plays with evident relish. Gianni Fabbrini's fortepiano is a role in itself, lively, witty and wise, always supporting and guiding the singers.</p> <p>The evening's three hours pass in a flash, walking the knife's edge between laughter and tears. In the diminutive Kammeroper, serving as a temporary space while the Theater an der Wien's home is renovated, we are drawn in to the opera's passionate intimacy.</p> <p>If you enjoy discovery, it does not get better than this. Catch it if you can.</p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>To December 31, </em><a href=\"https://www.theater-wien.at/en/events/92/Larbore-di-Diana\"><em>theater-wien.at</em></a></p><p>Source: Shirley Apthorp 2022 'Five stars for L'arbore di Diana, Vienna — steamy operatic satire' FT.com 6 December.
