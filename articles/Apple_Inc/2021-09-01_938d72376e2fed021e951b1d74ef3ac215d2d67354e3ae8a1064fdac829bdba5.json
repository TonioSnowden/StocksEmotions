  "text": "<p>Chenoweth is an actor and singer. She stars in the Apple TV+ series Schmigadoon!</p><p>Dean Karnazes</p><p>\"One time I ran 50 marathons in all of the 50 U.S. states for 50 consecutive days. I'll never forget marathon 19. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. How am I going to possibly run a marathon, let alone 31 more 31 days after that? The trick I learned is don't think about the future and don't reflect on the past. Just be in the here and now and the present moment of time and do the best you can do. It takes some discipline not to let your mind wander, but it is almost a Zen-like state where you can endure almost anything. Endurance comes from enduring. Throw yourself into these insane conquests and grovel through it and endure—that's how you build endurance. When you look inward, you either say, I deserve to be here, I paid my dues, or you say to yourself, You know, I spent too much time on the couch. You can't fool yourself.\"</p><p>Karnazes is an ultramarathon runner and the author, most recently, of A Runner's High: My Life in Motion.</p><p>Angela Duckworth</p><p>\"I define grit as a combination of two things: one is having a sustained commitment to some goal that you hold dear. The second thing is endurance in your effort, because you can care about something and not do anything about it. When you ask [people], 'Hey, can you do this thing,' they just say, 'Oh, yeah, I'll try harder. I'll try to be gritty. I'll just have more willpower. I'll suck it up.' In general, that doesn't work. The more artful way to do it is to find strategies that gritty people use that you can imitate. Most people actually struggle to figure out [their] passion. If you ask most 22-year-olds, 'What's the harder thing for you, having a work ethic or knowing what the hell you want to do with your life?' So many people are like, 'Trust me, I'm a hard worker. I just don't know what [I want] to do.' \"</p><p>Duckworth is a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.</p><p>Lonnie G. Bunch III</p><p>\"I look into history, and that gives me the inspiration to endure, recognizing that there are people in my family that started out enslaved, [then were] sharecroppers, and yet through education and sheer force of will they basically changed the trajectory of our family. As a historian I'm moved by John Lewis's career, moved by people like Fannie Lou Hamer who demanded the country be fair, at great personal risk. I would think that somebody will have a picture 100 years from now of people wearing masks going into the Smithsonian. What that'll tell you is that the Smithsonian was willing to deal with the cards it was dealt, grapple with the complexities and ambiguities of the day in order to make sure we could serve, educate and, in essence, define reality and give hope.\"</p><p>Bunch is a historian and the first African-American secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.</p><p>Nana Mensah</p><p>\"The hustle is so real. Unless you're doing, like, Hamilton or Harry Potter, most theater does not pay a living wage in New York City, so you need to be able to do commercials. You need to be able to go work at a nonprofit so that you have health insurance. There is a real endurance factor. You've got to spin a lot of plates and learn how to hang in there. This is a game of attrition. A lot of people, when they start out as actors, fresh out of school, rosy cheeks, think that all they need to do is sit on a stoop somewhere, and a director is going to walk by and give them a leading part in the new Michael Bay film. Endurance is a muscle that you need to exercise. Maybe you do get that Michael Bay film fresh out of school, but then in five years, 10 years, there's a drought, and you need to figure out how to be patient and how to wait for water.\"</p><p>Mensah is an actor, writer and director. She recently starred in the film Queen of Glory and the Netflix series The Chair.</p><p>Danny Elfman</p><p>\"In my world, endurance really means the constant ability to adapt and reinvent. That's the difference between composers who have continuing careers and those who have bright, short careers but disappear. To get complacent or comfortable too long is a creative death sentence. My first orchestral classical commissions were so intimidating. I felt like I was a little kid in the playground of the big boys. When I'm trying to listen to stuff to get myself inspired, I'll put on Bartók or Shostakovich, and it makes me want to just give up. I'm never going to be Bartók or Shostakovich or Prokofiev. Then at a certain point, you kind of smack yourself in the face and go, No, but I'll be what I'm going to be, and I'll be the best I can be. I won't ever be Shostakovich, but that's OK.\"</p><p>Elfman is a composer, singer and songwriter. His most recent album is Big Mess.</p><p>These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Why \"I'll Just Suck It Up\" Doesn't Work</p>",
