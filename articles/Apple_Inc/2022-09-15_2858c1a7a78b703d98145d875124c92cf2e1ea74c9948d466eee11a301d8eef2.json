  "text": "<p>Starting from one's club, head down St James's, down the steps and across the Mall. Cut across the park at the bridge, there's plenty of people there to lose any tail, and then dodge down the pedestrian route between the end of the Wellington Barracks and the Danish Club — they can't follow you there in a vehicle. Duck into the St James's Park underground station booking hall, straight out the other side, cut smartly left and into the entrance of a nondescript hotel called the Conrad Hilton. The place you're looking for is at the back of reception. Emma at the front desk is expecting you. </p> <p>It's called The Pem, Pem being the nickname of suffragette martyr <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34c214a0-6daa-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a\">Emily Wilding Davison</a>. (If you didn't already know who she was and now do, then the place has already achieved something far more significant than most restaurants could ever aspire to.) It is led by chef Sally Abé, late of the Harwood Arms and the Ledbury, which bodes much better than well. Front of house is the exceptional Emma Underwood, who by her very existence demolishes the “Maître” part of Maître d'. They are backed up by an almost entirely female team. </p> <p>The Pem is magnificent in the way that only a massive international hotel chain can manage. Dark, atmospheric, intimate, with red velvet booths, mirrors, dark wood and an extensive system of underground tunnels so that uniformed cast members can pop up out of nowhere and make your empty plate disappear without interrupting the magic. It is, I grant you, easier to find the back entrance to MI6 than this restaurant, but it's worth the trek for some of the best food in town.</p> <p>There are a lot of good wild mushrooms about at the moment so it seemed topical to order them, with a “St Ewe” egg, herb mousseline and truffle foam (227kcal). St Ewe was, apparently, “a female saint about whom very little is known”, but I'm canonising her as patron saint of “gilded yolk which pours forth like chrysm from the barely set, pearlescent white and oozing in golden sacrament over profane and earthy fungi”. Absolutely bloody cracking.</p> <p>It seemed sensible to go for Knife and Fork Bacon (351kcal. Oh yes. Didn't I mention? They do the calorie thing here) because, well, because bacon. Thick little wedges, cured in-house and presented, deservedly, like the very finest charcuterie, with pickled pearl onions, treacle and soured cream. There's a thing with thick bacon where the outside fries to a frazzle while the inside stays full of juices and fats. Yeah. That.</p> <p>I was suddenly and painfully aware that I was sitting in a peculiarly luxe establishment and yet had ordered, thus far, eggs and bacon. So it seemed right to try the Heritage Corn Royale, if only for the pure geekery of the name. A “Royale” is proper old school; set egg custard cut into shapes to float in a consommé. I&#xa0;like that Abé knows that and nods to it but I love even more that she interprets it as an unbelievably smooth, almost mellifluous <em>chawanmushi</em>-style custard, the corn flavour balanced with flaked Dorset crab and brown butter, then speckled with lemon verbena (372 . . . oh, honestly! Must we? I guess it's because they're a big hotel group).</p>  <p><strong>I've got to admit I've been</strong> getting some miserable lobsters lately. Tails about the size of an inadequate langoustine with the texture and appeal of a worn-out sex toy. There seems to be a London-wide plot to foist these miserable little crustacea on me, but this one couldn't have been more different. I have no idea what combination of poaching, grilling, glazing and other fettling took place, but the result was absolutely outstanding. Moist, tender, with just enough of that slight bitterness from scorched shell, but so, so&#xa0;sweet. </p> <p>To one side, lurking with intent next to a torched “Buffalo” tomato, was a comedy Jenga of chips, which could have been merely ironic had it not turned out to be made of chickpeas. An infinitely insubstantial chickpea pancake, repurposed into a baton and deep fried. Truly the Wonder of the Age when drenched in <em>sauce vierge</em>.</p> <p>One of the few men in the place is sommelier James Shaw, who bears quite the most beautiful wine list I've ever seen, a kind of candy pastel pink with a golden script logo like a Disney princess's spell book. Inside is the selection of modern West Coast American Chardonnays around which Abé is said to have built her menu. They are, apparently, her favourites and I can find no convincing counterargument. </p> <p>Within the region, the selection is catholic, from the 2017 Chanin “Bien Nacido” Chardonnay from Santa Barbara, which might comfortably be drunk wearing Persol sunglasses and a linen shirt while leaning on your Mustang, to a 2019 “Shafer” Chardonnay from Red Shoulder Ranch in the Napa Valley, for which, just for a small glass, you're going to need a three-piece suit in ecclesiastical purple satin, a pair of swan's-down wings and a&#xa0;PhD.</p> <p>It might have been the Chards talking, but something whispered in my ear “Granny Smith Pomme d'Eve. Apple and elderflower sorbet with a fennel salad,” and I could only succumb. Lo! I ate of it and, it will not surprise you to learn, felt not a twinge of shame.</p> <p>Now parliament has returned, The Pem is going to be full to bursting with people exchanging gossip and backhanders, but if you can organise a substantial party donation in exchange for a table, do it with a glad heart. </p> <p><em>Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timhayward\"><em>@TimHayward</em></a><em>, on Instagram </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/timhayward\"><em>@timhayward</em></a><em> and email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=tim.hayward@ft.com\"><em>tim.hayward@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Tim Hayward 2022 'The Pem, London: some of the best food in town' FT.com 15 September.
