And his arrangements with the world's biggest private equity firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66ba0aa3-4787-42c5-a024-e54bd0058bb0\">are complicated</a>, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Anna Nicolaou report.</p> <p>Mercuriadis pioneered the idea of turning songs into an asset class when he raised the London-listed <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Fund</strong> in 2018. It grew fast by repeatedly tapping investors for fresh money to buy more song catalogues from artists such as <strong>Blondie</strong> and <strong>Neil Young</strong>. By packaging the rights to thousands of songs together, royalty payments could be used as a revenue stream from which to pay dividends. </p> <p>But that fund is now, in effect, frozen. A drop in its share price means it can no longer raise money. The royalties generated by its current catalogue have fallen for at least the past two years, ever since the numbers were first disclosed. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11083965.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The cost of servicing its $600mn in debt is rising. And it hasn't bought a song in over a year. If costs stay constant, its revenues will need to rise about 20 per cent from 2021 levels to cover its prized dividend next year, calculations from the investment bank <strong>Stifel </strong>show. </p> <p>Mercuriadis was already, at least temporarily, out of cash for deals when Blackstone came on to the scene in October. It bought his management company, which advises the listed fund. It also, crucially, set up a new $1bn fund alongside the listed vehicle — giving Mercuriadis a new source of firepower. </p> <p>But in the months that followed, several artists have complained that Mercuriadis has failed to complete potential transactions that were under discussion. </p> <p>That's how Schwarzman got drawn into a conflict. The Grammy winner, whom the FT has agreed not to name because talks are still live, told Mercuriadis they had contacted Schwarzman because they believed their deal had stalled. </p> <p>Still, Blackstone could emerge as the winner, even if the listed fund — whose shareholders include the <strong>Church of England</strong>'s fund manager<strong> CCLA </strong>and <strong>Investec</strong>'s wealth management business — struggles. That's because it could buy its songs more cheaply in a crisis. </p> <p>The alternative: keep receiving management fees from the listed fund. Wall Street's financial engineers seem once again to have found a way to turn almost any situation to their advantage. </p> <h1>Tencent spells game over for a Ubisoft takeover</h1> <p>The <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game series depicts an age-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and their militaristic Templar foes.</p> <p>Shareholders in the games' creator <strong>Ubisoft</strong>, who had hoped for a takeover of the French video game developer from its founding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5905084-849a-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5\"><strong>Guillemot </strong>family</a>, are stuck with the current regime for now.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Ubisoft announced that the Chinese gaming conglomerate <strong>Tencent </strong>was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c011915-b292-4b2d-be36-e7c4a9e97acb\">planning to more than double</a> its stake in the company, the FT's Leila Abboud and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/anna-gross\">Anna Gross</a> reported.</p> <p>Instead of the stock climbing as many analysts predicted, investors took the news pretty badly. Its share price dropped precipitously on Wednesday morning and lost more than 17 per cent of its value over the course of the day, to €36.</p> <p>Shareholders had no doubt spent the summer salivating over recent media reports suggesting that the company could be approached by private equity for €100 per share. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft</strong>'s $75bn acquisition of video game maker <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/780c0432-554e-48fe-96df-6ffa4db9b5de\">despite current regulatory hangups</a>, and other high-profile takeovers in the gaming industry had bred widespread speculation that Ubisoft would be next to be scooped up by a Big Tech player or private equity firm.</p> <p>But now that Tencent and the Guillemot family have effectively teamed up in a shareholder pact, that makes the chances of a takeover bid from anyone other than the Chinese group much less likely. </p> <p>Tencent has become the single biggest shareholder, with an 11.2 per cent stake, which can be raised to 17 per cent, while the family now owns an 8.6 per cent stake in Ubisoft, according to data group<strong> Kepler</strong>.</p> <p>The deal implies a valuation of €80 per share for Ubisoft, a huge 83 per cent premium on the price of the stock after Tuesday's closing price of €43.50.</p> <p>But the share price slide on Wednesday suggests Tencent actually offered 122 per cent higher than the value of the stock once the takeover premium had disappeared. </p> <p>That's a pretty significant win for Ubisoft.</p> <p>While paying such a fatty premium isn't necessarily the best look for Tencent, it does help bolster its international gaming portfolio. The Chinese tech giant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcfb2481-29c3-4e50-9a72-c28bbdba696d\">has been hell-bent</a> on expanding since China imposed strict regulations on new gaming releases, stifling opportunities for growth in its home market.</p> <h1>Kim Kardashian adds private equity to her repertoire</h1> <p>Nearly a decade ago, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PshPLeR-8gI\">moment of on-camera vulnerability</a> by <strong>Kim Kardashian </strong>turned into a meme sensation. Not long after, fans could pay $1.99 to download Kimoji, Kim's emoji keyboard that featured her viral crying face, among other Kardashian iconography.</p> <p>It was the number-one paid app in the App Store for a time and just the beginning of the pop culture dynasty's gift for converting its celebrity and social media reach into financial gains.</p> <p>After lucrative forays into beauty and shapewear, Kardashian's latest business venture <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef3a875b-9fb4-4f76-9934-6c15a0068018\">is launching a private equity firm</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1567520709794213889\">https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1567520709794213889</a> <p>The new firm, <strong>SKKY Partners</strong>, is a collaboration between the reality star and former Carlyle Group executive <strong>Jay Sammons</strong>. The dealmaker has carved out a niche investing in celebrity-backed ventures including headphone maker <strong>Beats by Dre</strong>, which was acquired by <strong>Apple</strong> in 2014.</p> <p>Not all of Sammons's investments have been smooth sailing. In 2019, he led Carlye's backing of record executive <strong>Scooter Braun</strong> in buying <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>'s former label <strong>Big Machine Records</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a4f9fe-0e6b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">embroiling the private equity firm</a> in a feud between Braun and the pop singer.</p> <p>SKKY <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/kim-kardashians-latest-business-venture-private-equity-11662543001\">has yet to raise any funds</a>, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that Kim's mother <strong>Kris Jenner </strong>would also be a partner.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The new US owners of <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>, financier <strong>Todd Boehly</strong> and private equity group <strong>Clearlake Capital</strong>, <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3Qs2Smu\">have sacked</a> head coach <strong>Thomas Tuchel </strong>after a poor start to the season.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Bank of America </strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-07/bofa-names-burkhardt-investment-banking-chief-strategy-officer#xj4y7vzkg\">has named</a> <strong>JuliAnn Burkhardt</strong>, currently a managing director at the bank, as chief strategy officer for global investment banking. She succeeds <strong>David Fishman</strong>, who will rejoin BofA's global M&amp;A team, per Bloomberg.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has appointed <strong>Daniel Hanna</strong> as global head of sustainable finance, based in London.
