  "text": "<p>BYD, the Chinese auto group backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b600a20f-562e-4b4d-bf45-c32e8a0dd03a\">has dethroned Elon Musk's Tesla</a> as the world's biggest electric vehicle producer by sales, signalling China's rising dominance over the sector.</p> <p>Shenzhen-based BYD sold 641,000 vehicles in the first six months of the year, a more than 300 per cent jump from the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>That compared with 564,000 vehicles sold by Tesla, which has blamed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fce717e1-b98c-4e93-b7eb-86125fb798e9\">a tough second quarter</a> on supply chain and sales disruptions in China after its operations were hit by coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions.</p> <p>Tesla, along with a clutch of Chinese EV makers including Li Auto, Xpeng and Nio, were harder hit by the lockdowns than BYD, which benefited because most of its factories are not based in the regions and cities that suffered the most severe restrictions.</p> <p>Analysts view the rise of China's domestic auto industry as a forerunner to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcbc860b-51cd-40d8-b65f-db97ce9adc57\">a tectonic shift in the global auto market</a> as Chinese EV makers start to sharpen their focus on export markets.</p> <p><em>Thanks for all the comments following yesterday's article on Joe Biden opening up the Gulf of Mexico to further drilling.

Euro drops to 20-year low against the dollar </strong>The euro fell 0.9 per cent to $1.0325 earlier today, the weakest level against the dollar <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad7088f5-08f8-4e91-9319-50fec6886b4e#post-14c3376c-162e-46b8-8d4b-36f84964c6c4\">since December 2002</a>. The fall comes as the risk of recession in the eurozone grows. From Asia, prices in South Korea rose in June <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0f8cc03-fa41-4d3c-b17a-c25ee10468b7\">at the quickest pace since the 1998 Asian financial crisis</a> and China's services sector expanded <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad7088f5-08f8-4e91-9319-50fec6886b4e#post-ae43529f-a849-483c-a1e1-2ddecdebb7c4\">more rapidly</a> than expected last month.</p> <p><strong>2. Sequoia Capital China targets $9bn fundraising to plough into start-ups</strong> China's premier venture capital group is close to raising $9bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/151384c9-f93d-40a8-a4b7-7c473fe86a48\">to plough into start-ups desperate for cash</a>, defying global investor apprehension about Beijing's zero-Covid policies, a crackdown on technology groups and heightened geopolitical risk. People close to the group say the fundraising round, which was 50 per cent oversubscribed, will close this week.</p> <p><strong>3. Police arrest 22-year-old in connection with Chicago shooting</strong> Police have named Robert E Crimo III as a “person of interest” in connection with the killing of six people at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce5a7f4e-9acd-4c72-a66c-c65d858dab72\">an Independence Day parade in Highland Park</a>, an affluent suburb of Chicago. The attack is the latest in a string of mass shootings in the US and prompted President Joe Biden to say that America is suffering from “an epidemic of gun violence”.</p> <p><strong>4. Ukraine says national recovery plan to cost $750bn</strong> Ukraine's prime minister yesterday told the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, Switzerland that his country would need $750bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa657002-2269-433f-a1e3-cbf98b0aec27\">to rebuild its shattered infrastructure and revitalise its economy</a> after war with Russia. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, ordered his top generals <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97b5befe-be56-4377-a359-4a72ba8ed33a\">to carry on their advance</a> towards western parts of Ukraine's Donetsk province after the Russian army captured the country's far eastern Luhansk region at the weekend.</p> <p><strong>5. Chile unveils draft constitution</strong> Chile yesterday unveiled the final draft of a constitution born from a wave of protests two years ago. The new document, which puts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a20fc7-ae6e-4fe7-82a4-26635b3e96b8\">environment and indigenous rights at its core</a>, ends a year of debates broadcast live on television. President Gabriel Boric, who has staked much of his political capital on the project, intends to hold a vote on the charter in September. </p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Markets outlook</strong> After Monday's public holiday US shares are set to open higher this morning. Global stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5795f52f-36e0-45a5-bed6-f939e5535814\">have been buoyed</a> today by the encouraging signs from China's services sector after a closely watched survey indicated a rapid rebound in activity last month.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> US factory orders are expected to have jumped 0.5 per cent in May from 0.3 per cent the previous month, according to economists polled by Refinitiv. An increase in orders for durable goods boosted the April report. However, a recent survey from the Institute for Supply Management indicated new orders submitted to factories contracted for the first time since 2020 in June.</p> <p><strong>Nato accession&#xa0;</strong>The Nato accession protocol for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3801a72c-791c-4b0e-ab09-5fa583e6b6a5\">Sweden and Finland</a> will be signed in Brussels. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg will sign the protocol with the foreign ministers of both countries. The agreement must then be ratified by all 30 allied parliaments before Sweden and Finland become the newest members of the military alliance.</p> <p><strong>ECB crypto warning </strong>The European Central Bank's supervisory board gathers to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50388307-08a8-4330-be8e-ff17f41e8e13\">urgent need for “harmonisation”</a> of regulation among eurozone countries ahead of pending EU cryptocurrency rules.</p> <p><em>We are now accepting entries for the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c839cf6f-bb68-4189-b512-984c7b042d8b\"><em>2022 FT Innovative Lawyers North America</em></a><em> award. The report explores the key trends and transformations taking place in the legal sector and the awards event will be held in person on Thursday, December 8 in New York.</em></p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>How the man behind the Apple Store presided over a Spac catastrophe </strong>Plucked in 2000 by Steve Jobs after a successful run at Target, Ron Johnson is credited with developing the Apple Store, the iPhone maker's hyper-successful retail gambit. But his latest attempt to capture retailing magic has descended into a debacle <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/a7a7b073-123b-4ec9-a45a-d6df4d530f46\">emblematic of the boom and bust</a> in blank-cheque companies.</p> <p><strong>DeSantis benefits from ‘Trump fatigue' ahead of possible 2024 face-off</strong> Although Trump remains the de facto leader of the Republican party there is a strong push among the party's top backers in business and finance to put forward a different candidate in the next presidential election amid signs of fatigue within the conservative movement. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21c9dd87-2a20-4ed8-9a09-ae3d0ee52abc\">Florida governor Ron DeSantis stands out as the most viable alternative</a>. </p> <p><strong>Who pays for climate change? </strong>A Peruvian farmer is suing German utility RWE for the emissions it produced over 124 years, which he argues contributed to warming that threatens his hometown Huaraz. The case is just one of a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/e26c5813-354b-4b6b-8bc1-70b39ef9837c\">ballooning number of climate-related lawsuits</a> that have been filed since the Paris Agreement was signed six years ago.</p> <p><strong>Why groupthink might be a good thing after all </strong>If you have ever closely observed collective decision-making, you may have seen something which looks an awful lot like groupthink. Although its impact is difficult to quantify, an organisation that acts with unity of purpose is a better bet than one paralysed by indecision or internal division, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/f59cd53b-c5ff-494a-b776-defb0cf4cfff\">writes Stephen Bush</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crypto collapse reverberates widely among black American investors</strong> Historically, black investors have tended to be conservative, investing more of their money into low-risk assets such as insurance and savings bonds. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d338e2-3d3c-40ce-8a09-abfa25c16a7f\">But, fuelled by celebrity endorsements, cryptocurrency was different</a>. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>More cryptocurrency news</strong> Vauld, the crypto lender backed by Coinbase and investor Peter Thiel, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b7bf627-d171-4760-af81-df90e47612b3\">has halted withdrawals</a> and trading on its platform. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Style</h1> <p>Aurora James, the woman behind accessory brand Brother Vellies and the 15 Per Cent Pledge, talks about black entrepreneurship and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9553ac6-a727-4ce3-b93d-5de082006035\">her mission to rethink every closet in the US</a>. “What really inspires me is continuing to take market share from people who I think are not being thoughtful.”</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Sophia Smith  2022 'FirstFT: Chinese electric vehicle maker overtakes Tesla' FT.com 5 July.
