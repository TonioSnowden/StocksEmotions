  "text": "<p>Shopify has predicted that online retail would continue to show strong growth through the rest of this year, even as physical stores reopen in the US and Europe, after the Canadian tech company reported its first $1bn quarter. </p> <p>Revenues of $1.1bn for the second quarter were ahead of Wall Street's forecasts but increased at a slower pace than the 110 per cent growth Shopify reported in the first quarter. </p> <p>Amy Shapero, Shopify's finance chief, told analysts that even after the pandemic-fuelled growth experienced over the past year by ecommerce companies, she did not expect online retail spending to decline as lockdowns are lifted. </p> <p>“We do believe [ecommerce spending] has reset at a higher level and is now just growing at a more normalised level,” she said. </p> <p>Shopify is forecasting its revenues to grow “rapidly” this year, albeit at a slower pace than in 2020, as consumers spend more on services such as going out to restaurants and bars, and return to offline stores. </p> <p>Shapero said that in the UK, despite lockdown restrictions easing in recent weeks, spending through Shopify stores grew faster than its average across the rest of the world, boosted in part by improvements to its checkout systems for retailers to use in their physical stores. </p> <p>Overall, consumers spent $42.2bn with retailers that use Shopify's technology to run their online stores and process payments in the second quarter, up 40 per cent over the same period last year, when lockdowns triggered a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f62d84fd-895a-4474-acb4-389d88bb19da\"> 119 per cent rise i</a>n gross merchandise volume. </p> <p>Shopify also reported a huge jump in net income to $879.1m, from $36m a year ago. </p> <p>The profit increase was driven largely by an unrealised gain in the value of unspecified equity investments that Shopify has made in partners such as Stripe and Affirm. Even without that, its net income would still have more than tripled year on year to $101m. </p> <p>Shopify has recently struck deals to integrate its Shop Pay into Facebook and Google's ecommerce platforms. Shop Pay — Shopify's rival to PayPal and Apple Pay — has now processed more than $30bn in consumer spending since it launched in 2017. </p> <p>The company also confirmed that it is trying a push into online advertising for the first time, after news of a “data exchange network” for its merchants leaked last month. </p> <p>Tobi Lütke, Shopify's chief executive, said the initiative to allow merchants to advertise through its network, potentially including within its consumer-facing Shop app, was an “early experimentation”. </p> <p>“We are figuring out what the right mix of products is for a new merchant who is trying to build a business,” he told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. “If advertising from us in some means is part of that, we will hopefully develop it over the next years.” </p> <p>Shopify's shares, up by more than 40 per cent in the year to date, were broadly flat in early trading.</p><p>Source: Tim Bradshaw in London 2021 'Online shopping permanently boosted by pandemic, Shopify claims' FT.com 28 July.
