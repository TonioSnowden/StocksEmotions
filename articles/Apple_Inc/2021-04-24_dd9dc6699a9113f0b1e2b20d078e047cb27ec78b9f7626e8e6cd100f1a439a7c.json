  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Apple, Spotify Escalate Rivalry in Podcasts  ----  By Anne Steele",
  "text": "<p>   The battle for podcast dominance is on. </p><p>   A pair of announcements this past week -- Apple Inc.'s introduction of paid podcast subscriptions and Facebook Inc.'s new partnership with Spotify Technology SA to spur discovery and listening on the social network's platforms -- are the latest for a rapidly growing medium that is attracting top talent and top dollar. \"With Apple making its move into subscription, there is this platform war emerging,\" said Josh Lindgren, head of Creative Artists Agency's podcast department. </p><p>   Podcasting, already on a tear before the coronavirus pandemic, exploded in popularity during the lockdown, and is on track to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue this year from advertising in the U.S. for the first time. An estimated 116 million Americans, or 41% of the U.S. population over the age of 12, are now monthly podcast listeners, an 11% increase over 2020, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital. </p><p>   For years, competition in podcasts has been a lopsided one: Apple -- responsible for the namesake of the industry, a portmanteau of \"iPod\" and \"broadcast\" -- enjoyed its status as the default destination for listening while doing relatively little to enhance offerings or profits. Spotify, meanwhile, has lavished hundreds of millions on popular creators and companies -- sparking an arms race among iHeartMedia Inc., Audacy Inc. (formerly Entercom), Sirius XM Holdings Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which all now see podcasts as vital for keeping customers engaged with their services. </p><p>   Dawn Ostroff, Spotify's chief content and advertising business officer, said the rush of other bets on podcasting validates the company's early moves. </p><p>   \"We saw the opportunity before anybody else did, and we've been at it significantly longer than anyone else,\" she said. </p><p>   To some observers, Apple's podcast news is akin to the awakening of a sleeping giant. More than 15 years after adding podcasts to its iTunes software, the tech company introduced a way for podcasters on its platform to sell subscriptions. Until now, the company has neither offered paid access for podcasts nor earned a commission from ads that appear in the more than two million shows on its platform. Apple declined to comment. </p><p>   \"Apple, where podcasting originated, cannot lose out on the podcasting battle,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. \"It's both a defensive move toward Spotify but also offensive in terms of monetizing.\" </p><p>   Podcasters will pay Apple $19.99 a year to enable subscriptions, and set their own prices for listeners. Apple will take a 30% cut of subscription revenue the first year, and a 15% take thereafter. </p><p>   Spotify, the big spender on exclusives, talent and technology, has also sought to make the medium more financially viable through advertising and eventually subscription. </p><p>   Spotify now carries more than 2.2 million podcasts on its service, up from 450,000 in 2019. The Swedish streamer's podcast listenership in the U.S. is on track to overtake Apple Podcasts' this year, according to a forecast from research firm eMarketer. Though Apple's service has grown along with the medium, it has lost market share, falling to 24% in 2021, from 34% in 2018. </p><p>   Apple's podcast subscription, which rolls out next month to users, will have company. Spotify plans to announce its own offering next week, according to people familiar with the matter. It will not charge podcasters, nor take a cut from their subscriptions, and will allow them to set their own pricing, one of those people said. </p><p>   Users of Spotify's iOS app who subscribe will be routed to a website for the transaction, meaning that Apple won't take a cut of that revenue, the person said. </p><p></p>",
