  "title": "Risky Borrowers Largely Dodged Bankruptcy So Far This Year. Now the Easy Money Is Ending. Corporate defaults in the U.S. are expected to grow modestly from historically low levels due to rising rates and slowing economy",
  "text": "<p>Debt defaults were relatively avoidable for much of the past two years as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at ultralow levels, a trend that continued early this year. Even troubled companies have been able to borrow in a supportive credit market. Yield-hungry investors have helped stave off defaults, finding ways for businesses to take on more debt and delay a financial reckoning.</p><p>Market sentiment has held that bankruptcies would stay relatively lowas interest rates returned to historical averages and pandemic stimulus programs came to an end. Now the Fed's resolve to combat inflation with accelerated interest-rate hikes is putting that assumption to the test. The central bank raised rates by 0.75 percentage point in June, the largest rate hike in 28 years, and another increase of that size could be on tap at its next meeting this month.</p><p>Debt investors are increasingly worrying whether inflation and slowing growth coupled with a less accommodative market will push more borrowers into default. Credit markets are tightening for lower-rated issuers, raising the price of leveraged loans and slowing the issuance of high-yield bonds. Even high-quality corporate bonds are weakening.</p><p>\"The recent run of remarkably favorable financing conditions has already come to an apparent end, and we believe investors could soon demand significantly higher returns for the risks they're assuming,\" S&amp;P Global Ratings analysts said in a report this week.</p><p>As a result, S&amp;P expects that by March 2023, default rates for speculative-grade U.S. corporate issuers over the preceding 12 months will have risen to 3%, more than double the 1.4% level recorded in March of this year. The default rate could jump to 6% under S&amp;P's pessimistic scenario.</p><p>There are signs that risky investments made in recent years' easy-money, borrower-friendly environment are at higher risk of failing.</p><p>Businesses brought to public markets through special-purpose acquisition corporations are warning they might go bust. Electric-vehicle startup Electric Last Mile Solutions Inc. and former Apple Inc. sales guru Ron Johnson's retail venture Enjoy Technology Inc. filed for bankruptcy this year after their SPAC deals last year.</p><p>A tight job market has hurt companies in labor-intensive industries like food service, assisted living and home healthcare.</p><p>Overall rates of corporate bankruptcy filings remain low by historical standards. Last year, commercial chapter 11 filings dropped to their lowest level since 2006. In January to May of this year, there were roughly 1,300 commercial chapter 11 filings, down 28% from the comparable period last year, according to data from legal-services company Epiq Systems Inc.'s Aacer unit.</p><p>But some types of bankruptcies are starting to tick up. Commercial chapter 11 filings totaled 330 in May, the most recent month for which data are available, marking a 34% increase from May 2021, according to Epiq. Overall commercial bankruptcy filings were roughly flat in May compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Higher numbers of chapter 11 filings in some industries are being partly offset by the relative health of oil-and-gas drillers and power generators, which were among the largest contributors to the 2020 bankruptcy wave. Now, they are benefiting from higher global oil prices and stronger U.S. power markets. Older fossil-fuel plants are getting support from creditors and in some cases a new lease on life.</p><p>Hotels, hit hard by the onset of Covid-19, have also come back this year as consumers get comfortable traveling again.</p><p>But inflation and the Fed's efforts to tame it are rippling out in other ways as borrowing costs go up for businesses and consumers alike. Household spending is cooling. Mortgage rates are near multiyear highs. Interest-rate hikes are crimping home refinancings, a factor in residential lender First Guaranty Mortgage Corp.'s chapter 11 filing this week.</p><p>And amid a broad selloff of risk assets, cryptocurrencies have shed roughly $2 trillion in market value since bitcoin's all-time high in November. Crypto lending platforms and trading exchanges have felt the effects. Celsius Network LLC, among the largest crypto lenders, has hired legal and financial advisers to look at options, including a bankruptcy filing, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Crypto mining operations are watching their stocks slide, too. Digital-asset holders are coming to the realization that in a bankruptcy setting, they would have little in the way of legal protections compared to customers of regulated banks and brokerages.</p><p>Despite macroeconomic risks, Fitch Ratings Inc. expects default rates for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds of 1.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year, rising as high as 2% and 1.75%, respectively, in 2023, the ratings firm said in a June report.</p><p>Corporations are under little pressure to pay down debt this year and for the good part of next year because many borrowers took advantage of the recent easy-money environment and extended debt maturities beyond 2024. Roughly $8.9 billion of U.S. speculative-grade debt matures in 2022, about 8% of the total $110 billion due in the next five years, according to S&amp;P.</p><p>The June bankruptcy of Revlon Inc. brought Fitch's trailing 12-month U.S. institutional leveraged-loan default rate to 1%, its highest since September 2021. Revlon survived early pandemic lockdowns but couldn't weather the inflationary pressures and supply-chain problems it faced this year.</p><p>\"We anticipate defaults will take time to materialize as high inflation and slower economic growth adversely affects revenue and margins of speculative-grade issuers that extended maturities and boosted liquidity during the pandemic,\" the Fitch report said.</p><p>Jodi Xu Klein contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p><p>Risky Borrowers Largely Dodged Bankruptcy So Far This Year.
