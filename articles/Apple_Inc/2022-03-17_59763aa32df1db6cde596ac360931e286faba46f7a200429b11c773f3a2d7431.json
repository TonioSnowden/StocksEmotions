  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- China reported a drop in new coronavirus cases, as authorities worked swiftly to contain outbreaks with lockdowns and factory closures, as well as tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods. </p><p>   Companies must navigate rapidly changing restrictions, making it hard to gauge the extent of the impact on China's economy and global supply chains. In the southern tech hub and export powerhouse of Shenzhen, Apple Inc. assembler Foxconn Technology Group said it had been given approval to resume some operations. Tesla Inc. said it would suspend production at its Shanghai factory. Tighter controls on taking goods between provinces also threatened to disrupt the nation's logistics sector. </p><p>   Whether China can contain the outbreaks quickly could have deep implications for the global economy. Half of China's exports are produced in areas now experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks, and three quarters of its exports are shipped from them, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. It is still possible that infections could be suppressed without causing widespread disruption to global supply chains as it has for previous outbreaks, Mr. Williams wrote in a Wednesday note, but the risk that supply chains' links within China get severed is the highest it has been in two years. </p><p>   New infections reported on Wednesday fell by more than a third to 3,054, with almost half of the cases found in the northeastern province of Jilin. Since Monday, its 24 million people haven't been allowed to leave the province as authorities race to control the outbreak. </p><p></p>",
