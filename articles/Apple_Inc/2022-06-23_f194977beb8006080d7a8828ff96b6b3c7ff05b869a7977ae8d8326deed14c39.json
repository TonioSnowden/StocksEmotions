  "title": "'Apples' Review: A Fantasy About Forgetting; Director Christos Nikou's surreal new movie, in which amnesia goes viral, has a memorable range of allegorical implications",
  "text": "<p>The implied comment on the way we live now has some satirical weight. Haven't we, as a culture, become willfully forgetful? There is so much to keep track of in the moment that we become increasingly dismissive of the past, whether in the political, social or cultural realm. Moreover, just as the hollowed-out amnesiacs in the movie have difficulty forging genuine human relationships, in our pandemic age it sometimes seems that we can't connect with each other anymore. Instead of building intimacy, we take selfies.</p><p>From the point of view of that unidentified Athens man (Aris Servetalis) who forgets who he is after buying flowers and getting on a bus, Mr. Nikou dryly relates a loopy, deadpan parable in the spirit of Kafka and Borges. Initially, just about the only trait the man seems to retain from his entire life is a fondness for apples, which he consumes with a near-religious concentration.</p><p>Sometimes family members come and collect the forgetters; others, such as the disaffected protagonist, are simply labeled \"unclaimed patients\" and put through a bizarre course of therapy. Two clinicians (Anna Kalaitzidou, Argyris Bakirtzis) have devised a quack rehabilitation that entails ordering the patients to do memorable things (have a one-night stand, jump off a diving platform, attend a costume party) and take selfies of each event, to be saved in a scrapbook. The intent is to build a fake new self by hastily slapping together a library of memories, as though the most complex of processes can be replaced by a crude contrivance. Mr. Nikou's characters react with perfect nonchalance and complete obedience when told to, for instance, drive a car into a tree and take a Polaroid of the crash.</p><p>With its combination of fish-eyed lunacy and implied desperation, \"Apples\" recalls the films of Greece's most prominent living director, Yorgos Lanthimos, whose 2015 effort \"The Lobster\" had a similar feel. Mr. Nikou clearly admires Mr. Lanthimos, for whom he worked on the 2009 film \"Dogtooth,\" and also seems to pay homage to Michel Gondry's 2004 movie \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" when he introduces an amnesiac woman patient who is undergoing the same memory-gathering therapy as the protagonist. Here, the woman (Sofia Georgovassili) befriends the man at a screening of a slasher movie, but as the two spend more and more time together it's unclear whether they are forging a real bond or merely following the instructions of the rehabilitation regimen.</p><p>Despite its openness to interpretation, \"Apples\" does have a somewhat conventional mystery at its core, which echoes Christopher Nolan's brilliant 2001 film \"Memento\": Who is this man, and what caused him to lose his memory? The film is a sort of jigsaw puzzle that demands either paying minute attention or viewing it twice. Seemingly unimportant and easily forgotten details from the opening minutes turn out to cohere and create a conclusive emotional impact of the kind that everyone in the movie is missing.</p><p>Though the sense of closure is welcome, however, the final act is a bit underwhelming, just as Mr. Servetalis is in the lead role. Some actors can do nothing and be captivating, but Mr. Servetalis lacks that gift. He underplays his part to the point where he scarcely seems to be present. He and Mr. Nikou, who co-wrote the screenplay with Stavros Raptis, don't deliver as much as they promise. Instead of expanding his tableau to a broad statement, in the final scenes Mr. Nikou zooms in on a not-very-compelling culprit for memory loss, a case of the sads that has nothing much to do with our moment or with our cultural predicaments. Still, Mr. Nikou exhibits both a colorful imagination and a deft hand as a director. His is a name to be remembered.</p><p>Mr. Smith is critic-at-large for National Review.</p><p>'Apples' Review: A Fantasy About Forgetting</p>",
