Apple's system wouldn't flag offending content if it wasn't uploaded to the cloud.</p><p>Privacy experts and critics worried the feature was a signal that the tech giant was softening its posture toward how it protects data via encryption.

Two patients filed a class-action lawsuit against Illinois-based DuPage Medical Group after it said that it is notifying 600,000 patients that their data was exposed in a July cyberattack. The lawsuit alleges that the medical group didn't do enough to protect patients' data.
