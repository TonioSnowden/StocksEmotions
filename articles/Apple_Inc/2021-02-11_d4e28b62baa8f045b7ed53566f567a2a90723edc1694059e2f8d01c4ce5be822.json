  "text": "<p>\n  Before Big Loud Records suspended Morgan Wallen last week for making a racial slur, the 27-year-old singer was on his way to becoming country music's next big superstar. Music executives say he ticked all of Nashville's boxes: a compelling voice, well-crafted songs about small towns, drinking and relationships, a commercial sound made for radio and a little old-school swagger. Importantly, he became a streaming giant -- a rarity in country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop and other genres on streaming services. </p><p>\n  His rapid rise appeared to falter last week after the East Tennessee star was captured on video calling one of the people in his group of friends the N-word as he said goodnight. Mr. Wallen apologized immediately. But the reaction was just as swift: Last Wednesday, Feb. 3,  country-music radio stations dropped him from the airwaves and streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music removed him from important playlists, though he remained searchable. WME, his talent agency, dropped him, according to a spokesperson. </p><p>\n  On Wednesday night, Mr. Wallen released a five-minute video statement expanding on his initial apology and saying he's been sober for nine days. \"I appreciate those who still see something in me and have defended me, but for today, please don't. I was wrong,\" he said. </p><p>\n  On Sunday Mr. Wallen's latest album, \"Dangerous,\" hit No. 1 on Billboard's all-genre album sales chart for the fourth straight week since its release -- which hasn't happened for a country album in about 18 years. Early indications suggest it could be No. 1 again next week. Music-industry experts answered key questions about Mr. Wallen and what the controversy means (and doesn't mean) for country music: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Did the industry rebuke hurt Mr. Wallen's sales and streams? </p><p>\n  It's still early days. But Mr. Wallen's sales are steady and even rising, albeit with some caveats. </p><p>\n  Billboard's album chart tracks numbers from Friday to Thursday. Mr. Wallen's album \"Dangerous\" moved 149,000 \"equivalent-album units\" in the latest week ending Thursday, Feb. 4, a measurement that includes U.S. sales and streaming. That's up 14% from the previous week. </p><p>\n  On Feb. 2, before the controversy erupted that night, it was already likely that Mr. Wallen would finish on top. By the time news spread last Wednesday, there were only two days left in which his sales and streams could be affected. </p><p>\n  Still, instead of falling, which would be typical for an album in its fourth week, on-demand U.S. streams of \"Dangerous\" increased to 160 million. </p><p>\n  Sales of physical and digital albums jumped. And Mr. Wallen's previous album, 2018's \"If I Know Me,\" rose to No. 17 from No. 31 on the album chart. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  What about radio? </p><p>\n  That's where Mr. Wallen's overall catalog took a huge hit. Billboard measured an average of 1,500 to 1,600 daily plays from Jan. 30 through Feb. 2. After the controversy erupted on Feb. 3, when radio DJs dropped him, his play-count fell 74% that day. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  What does this mean longer-term for Morgan Wallen's career? </p><p>\n  Mr. Wallen has been a magnet for controversy. In October, his musical appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" was canceled after he was seen flouting Covid-19 protocols beforehand. He apologized and was invited back to perform in December. In a previous incident in May, he was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct at a Nashville bar, also apologizing afterward. </p><p>\n  The rebuke he experienced last week from the country-music industry was unusually severe, music-business experts say. How far it goes is an open question. Although the mainstream Nashville establishment appears to be punishing Mr. Wallen, experts say the distancing is likely driven more by huge industry players like the major radio networks iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media. In the wake of last year's racial-justice protests, these experts say the music business is moving swiftly to neutralize threats. \"I see this less as country-radio responding, and more as corporate America responding,\" says Bill Werde, director of Syracuse University's Bandier music-industry program. Spokespeople for iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media didn't respond to requests for comment. Spotify declined to comment. </p><p>\n  Big Loud Records, Mr. Wallen's label, which teamed up with Republic Records, part of Universal Music Group, for \"Dangerous,\" suspended him, but hasn't dropped him. That's raising some skepticism. \"I don't even know what that means,\" says Mr. Werde, referring to Mr. Wallen's indefinite suspension. Big Loud, which also manages Mr. Wallen in addition to being his label, didn't respond to requests for comment. Republic also didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>\n  Many of country's bigger-selling and more traditional artists have been quiet. Meanwhile, some fans have rallied behind Mr. Wallen, arguing that the industry response was excessive. \"You're already seeing a backlash to the backlash,\" with people beginning to speak out on behalf of Mr. Wallen, Mr. Werde says. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How has the blowup affected the country-music industry so far? </p><p>\n  The emergence of the video has led to public discussions about racism in country music, a genre that has long been criticized for not having greater representation, and raised further questions about how the industry will respond. </p><p>\n  Sheryl Guinn, the president of the NAACP's Nashville chapter, said in a statement that she \"offered to educate [Mr. Wallen on the history of the N-word], but it does not exonerate accountability on his part.\" </p><p>\n  Within the music industry, debate erupted on social media. When the controversy first broke the night of Feb. 2, Kelsea Ballerini, a female country singer, said on Twitter that \"the news out of Nashville tonight does not represent country music.\" However, country artist Maren Morris disagreed: \"It actually IS representative of our town,\" she posted. </p><p>\n  \"When I read comments saying 'this is not who we are' I laugh because this is exactly who country music is,\" posted Mickey Guyton, a Black country artist. \"I've witnessed it for 10 gd years. You guys should just read some of the vile comments hurled at me on a daily basis.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How will country music fare on streaming services without Mr. Wallen? </p><p>\n  The pandemic has accelerated a move by country fans onto streaming services, as many have been at home and increasingly using voice-activated home speakers. Country's recent gains on streaming outpaced those of many other genres: Last year, country rose to 7.5% of all U.S. audio streams, up from 6.9% before Covid-19. \"Country-music streaming and revenue will be just fine,\" Mr. Werde says. </p><p></p>",
