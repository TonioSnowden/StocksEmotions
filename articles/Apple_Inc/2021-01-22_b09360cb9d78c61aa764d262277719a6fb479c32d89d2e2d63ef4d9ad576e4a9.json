  "text": "<p>“No place for sissies” was Bette Davis's terse dispatch from that mysterious land: old age. Few popular artists have dwelt as much on what it is to be a woman of years, in the workplace, in social life and, with the delicacy of Code-era Hollywood, in bed.&#xa0;<em>All About Eve</em>&#xa0;was just one of her turns as someone whose desire does not wane even as the opportunities to act on it do.</p> <p>Her elemental presence aside, the Davis canon rewards viewing now because it corrects our idea of ageism as something recent and tech-driven. What comes across, if anything, is the sadistic earliness of a person's social ostracism back then. If people were expected to bow out of the good life at 40, that works out at something like 65 in new money. Mores have more than kept up with the elongation of lifespans.</p> <p>Knowing&#xa0;how well the modern world has suited me in my twenties and thirties, I have tended to go along with the notion of it as vindictively ageist.&#xa0;The challenge is to reconcile that slander with the two most important events of the past year.&#xa0;Each tested the public's disposition towards the old. Each has revealed a generosity that verges on deference.</p> <p>One was the election of another septuagenarian to lead the free world. If a single data-point reeks of cherry-picking, remember that Joe Biden's legislation will fall to an 80 year-old Nancy Pelosi and a 70 year-old Chuck Schumer to guide through Congress. Janet Yellen (74) will co-run the planet's largest economy with that tyro Jay Powell (67). </p> <p>Had Biden not clinched the Democratic nomination, it would have been Bernie Sanders (79), though Elizabeth Warren (71) also ran gamely. Had November gone differently, the reigning president and Senate majority leader would still be 74 and 78 respectively.</p> <p>And all this in a country with a lower median age than much of the developed world. If the young have a bias for their own, the grandest offices of state seem exempt from the prejudice.</p> <p>Perhaps America's constitutional gerontocracy is just a cosmetic sop to the old. It is plainly no substitute for age-blind hiring in the industries where most people work. But if real-world consequence is what matters, we still have the other story of our times.</p> <p>With all due stipulations about Covid-19 — which kills across the age range&#xa0;— the war against it has been a handsome gesture by the young and youngish on behalf of the old. The health benefits of lockdown accrue disproportionately to retirees. The material costs weigh disproportionately on students and those starting their careers. This asymmetry follows an era in which millennial hardship contrasted with the passive enrichment of asset-owning boomers.</p> <p>All the conditions were there, in other words, for a social rupture over the lockdown.&#xa0;And still the policy commands a scarcely believable degree of assent. Even countries that are on their third lockdown in less than a year report super-majorities in its favour. Burke's heart would soar at the intergenerational contract.</p> <p>Of course, these are hopelessly world-historical events. Neither helps with the common ignominies of unanswered job applications and the mid-life dating that Davis immortalised. It is just that I have seen up close how the nexus of forceful campaign groups and credulous journalists can inflate social crises. While it exists, and is my fate circa 2040, ageism should not join the “loneliness epidemic” as a blight that looms larger in commentary than it does in the data.</p> <p>Last week, Jonathan Sumption, the lawyer-historian and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96674b7a-dfa6-4535-9f75-dfbe459593c9\">lockdown-sceptic</a>, disputed that human lives are of equal value. The young's are worth more because they have a “lot more of it ahead”. Even aside from the temporal magnanimity (he is 72) he was stating what is already implicit in public policy. Drugs are assessed, among other criteria, on the extra years they buy a patient, adjusted for cost. We literally put a price on life, and we do it all the time.</p> <p>I need only describe the Sumption view, however, for you to guess how he fares when he airs it. As tight as his case is, as fine as his Inner Temple mind, the wagons start to circle the old when he speaks, and with some vehemence. Whatever it reveals about us — the residue of religion is my guess — it is not a cruel cult of youth.</p> <p><em>Email Janan at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=janan.ganesh@ft.com\"><em>janan.ganesh@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
