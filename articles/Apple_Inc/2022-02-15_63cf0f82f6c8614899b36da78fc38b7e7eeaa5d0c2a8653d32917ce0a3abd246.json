  "text": "<p>Minnesota's Polaris Inc. opposes granting the exclusion but has asked the USTR to exempt items including Chinese parts it imports to build its products in the U.S.</p><p>Granting exclusions for finished Chinese ATVs \"without granting meaningful tariff relief for components used in the U.S. manufacture of comparable ATVs disadvantages U.S. manufacturers and workers,\" Polaris said in its filing.</p><p>The conflict in the ATV industry illustrates one of the dilemmas facing the Biden administration as it considers granting exemptions to Chinese import tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Trump administration granted fewer than 7,000 tariff exemptions to U.S. companies that claimed they couldn't find comparable products in other countries or domestically. But with the exception of medical equipment needed to fight the pandemic, most of those exemptions expired by 2020.</p><p>In October, the Biden administration said it would consider reinstating previously granted tariff exclusions on 549 categories of products. Since then, it has receivedmore than 2,000 requests from businesses -- most seeking to have tariffs peeled back, but some pushing to keep them in place.</p><p>The application window for exemptions expired Dec. 1, and the USTR's office hasn't made any decisions -- frustrating some businesses that say the delay is costing them money.</p><p>For others, an even bigger problem is that the Biden administration is only considering granting exclusions for items that had previously been granted exemptions.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in October that the administration is open to expanding the exclusion process but hasn't announced any plans to do so. Her office didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>Other companies seeking tariff exemptions include Apple Inc., which has asked for reinstatement of an exclusion on its Apple Watch and on components used to build its U.S.-made Mac Pro.</p>",
