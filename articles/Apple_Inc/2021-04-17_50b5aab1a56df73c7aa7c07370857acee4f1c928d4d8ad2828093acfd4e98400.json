  "title": "Ground rules: the seeds to sow now for summer blooms",
  "text": "<p>Whatever next in the garden? That heavenly Easter Sunday warmed the soil and brought almost everything visibly into life. A rogue bout of snow on Easter Monday failed to sabotage it. So it followed up with a cruel sequel this recent Monday, 6in of snow overnight in my garden. By midday it had gone again.</p> <p>So far, I admit to being a slow starter, held back first by the endless early rain, then by the cold wind. No longer: I must make progress, building on last year's lockdown. We all start from a tidier point this year. The major gainers from lockdowns have been gardeners.</p> <p>Between now and mid-May we can all sow seeds, even without any heat indoors. The ground will surely warm again, so look for seed packets marked “hardy annual” and sow them directly into the soil when it has been broken down, raked to a fine texture and then watered lightly on a dry day from a watering can with a head, or rose, on it. Let the soil sit for a few hours and return armed with a seed packet. There are several ways to go, of which the easiest is to choose big, foolproof seeds.</p> <p>The most satisfying are sunflowers. They have been transformed by targeted breeding in the past two decades and are now my first choices for anyone with a sunny garden and a wish to be original. Go to<a href=\"https://www.thompson-morgan.com/\"> thompson-morgan.com</a> for options and then consider making sunflowers the dominant theme of your urban garden or the backbone of a border in a more spacious setting. </p> <p>Sown now, they will begin to flower in late July, having grown with gratifying speed. The tall ones can go along a sunny urban boundary fence or in one of those awkwardly narrow beds along a wall, reaching up to 5ft in height.</p> <p>I had great results two years ago from a threesome of the velvety red Velvet Queen, lovely cream-white Italian White, with the contrast of its dark centres, and lemon-yellow Valentine. The plants race up to their full height and flower on and on until October on strong stems. Bees love them, refuting the myth that they will only take pollen off “native” British flowers.</p> <p>The good news is that sunflowers now come at reduced heights, fit for big pots, containers and lesser flowerbeds. Thompson and Morgan even propose their Dwarf Yellow Spray variety for a hedge, 2ft high, of wide-open, dark yellow flowers, ready from seed in a mere three months. If sown now, a hedge of them could be a wonder in a warm Mediterranean garden.</p> <p>In big pots I have had great displays from the clear yellow Choco Sun, with its dark centres, and the remarkable Solar Flash, which stops at about 1.5ft and is covered in yellow flowers heavily ringed with red, round a dark centre too. These sunflowers are not plants to mix with other bedding, lobelias and so forth. They grow fast and need the container all to themselves. </p> <p>I love my lilies in pots, but I am fed up with the way they die back after flowering and then look wretched by the main door. In August, I will swap them round with pots of these sunflowers, which keep on flowering flat out until October.</p> <p>In window boxes, go for nasturtiums. The big seeds are so marvellously easy to sow. All you have to do is push them into the soil at about 6in intervals, water them and wait. In Provence and parts of Spain, I love the effect of geraniums trailing down from pots or window boxes on steps or the fronts of houses. In Britain, nasturtiums will do the same, making a curtain of long stems if you choose a suitable variety.</p> <p>Obviously, the Tom Thumb varieties will not trail. Better candidates are cream and yellow Troika and the dark red Jewel of Africa, a very long trailer. The one problem, apart from the need for regular watering, is their attraction for small black flies. Squash them at the first sign, and then wait for a curtain of nasturtiums tumbling over your window boxes. </p> <p>Trailing varieties are sometimes sold as pre-grown plants in boxes or plastic strips in mid-May, but are not widely available. They are too untidy to transport. Sow your own and save the cost.</p> <p>Smaller seeds need more attention. Break down the soil in the same way, but with the back of a rake or even the handle of a trowel, press it into shallow drills, like little valleys in straight lines. Then cut the seed packet across the top and tip a part of its contents on to your hand held flat. If the seed is fine, pinch it off one hand with fingers from the other and scatter it sparsely along the drill you have made. The drill does not need to be deep, half an inch being the maximum for most things. </p> <p>Rake the soil gently back over the drill to cover it and then press it down lightly with the head of the rake turned flat. Water the drills in dry weather, always from a can with a rose on it to simulate fine rain. Never splosh the water from an open can as it will wash the seeds out of place. In three weeks you should see young seedlings emerging, a never-failing thrill.</p> <p>Why not try the trendy Ammi, a favourite of the florists' trade which gardeners were slow to pick up? I grow Graceland and enjoy it in the gaps that open in flower beds when early flowerers such as poppies start to disappear. It grows up to 4ft high and has white flowers and finely cut, ferny leaves, easily accommodated among other plants. It too will not appear for sale pre-grown in late May.</p> <p>Nor will the fabulous deep blue phacelia, my yearly wonder that spreads about 9in wide and never exceeds the same 9in of height. The deep blue is unsurpassed in the plant kingdom, and I cannot imagine why it is not a number-one national seller. </p> <p>The species to buy is Phacelia campanularia, available from <a href=\"https://www.johnsons-seeds.com/\">Johnsons Seeds</a> with Sarah Raven on the packet to cheer you on. Otherwise, without the Raven name, you can go to <a href=\"https://www.plant-world-seeds.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9r-DBhBxEiwA9qYUpdphg5SKIHxZaLMH2dGiFC7u1p2yd-hMhkqCdLF_m4pmkebmuqYQDBoCIfMQAvD_BwE\">Plant World Seeds, </a>one of the best catalogues for unusual seeds, including alpines and perennials. They call this phacelia the “desert bluebell”, but it is far better than that.</p> <p>Finally, back to childhood. I grew clarkias from seed when I was 11, as any child prised off a video game still could. I liked the double rose-pink, red and pink flowers from the old mixed packet, but Thompson and Morgan now offer a pale pink shaded with white as an isolated colour. Clarkia Apple Blossom is easier to mix into a carefully planned border, where it reaches about 3ft, and has real distinction. </p> <p>Use your imagination and do not wait only for what the bedding trade will offer pre-grown next month. Home sow it and multiply your options.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Robin Lane Fox 2021 'Ground rules: the seeds to sow now for summer blooms' FT.com 17 April.
