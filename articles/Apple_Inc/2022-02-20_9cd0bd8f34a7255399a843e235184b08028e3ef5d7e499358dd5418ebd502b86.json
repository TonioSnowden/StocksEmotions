  "text": "<p>Ecommerce specialist Clipper Logistics plans to accept a potential cash-and-share takeover offer by New York-listed GXO Logistics that would value the British group at £943mn.</p> <p>Clipper, which processes orders for Asos, H&amp;M and Marks and Spencer, has agreed to GXO's proposal to pay 690p in cash and issue 230p of new GXO stock for each Clipper share. This represents a 32 per cent premium to the Leeds-based company's three-month average share price, the groups said in a joint statement on Sunday.</p> <p>GXO is yet to make a firm offer but Clipper's board confirmed to its rival that it would accept an offer on those terms.</p> <p>If the deal goes ahead, it would cement GXO's position at the centre of British supply chains and online retail, adding to its acquisition of Swiss rival Kuehne+Nagel's UK contract logistics business in 2020.</p> <p>The fragmented logistics sector has witnessed a flurry of dealmaking in recent months with container shipping lines such as Maersk using bumper profits to snap up logistics businesses.</p> <p>GXO's chief executive Malcolm Wilson said: “This potential acquisition would enhance GXO's position as a successful pure-play logistics leader. Our two companies have highly complementary service offerings, customer portfolios, and footprints in the UK and Europe.”</p> <p>Clipper was founded in 1992 by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfe50724-eaad-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\">Steve Parkin</a>, a former coal miner who started the business with just one truck. It listed in London in 2014 with a market capitalisation of £100mn.</p> <p>In 2020, plans for private equity group Sun Capital to buy the group were shelved after they disagreed over a £300mn price tag.</p> <p>Clipper's turnover has doubled since 2017 and its shares have trebled since the onset of the pandemic, which supercharged growth in online shopping. </p> <p>Logistics companies say the complexity of ecommerce has driven retailers to outsource warehousing and supply chain operations to specialist providers.</p> <p>Clipper runs warehouses for retailers in the UK and Europe, particularly those in the fashion sector, helping them process online orders, including returns, and repairs for electronics.</p> <p>It had been planning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4caacb7d-28fa-4295-8d3a-ef812da50040\">to expand in the US</a> where GXO has a large presence.</p> <p>The deal could result in a £104mn payout as well as shares in GXO for Parkin, who owns a 14.7 per cent stake in the business. He sold a 10 per cent shareholding last year for about £62mn.</p> <p>He has been interested in buying Leeds United football club, where his company sponsors the training kit.</p> <p>GXO was spun-off from trucking group XPO Logistics last year in order to focus on warehousing and picking, packing and distributing goods for big brand names such as Nestlé, Apple and Nike.</p> <p>It had $7.9bn in revenues last year, making it one of the world's largest contract logistics providers.</p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey 2022 'Clipper Logistics welcomes possible £1bn offer from US rival GXO' FT.com 20 February.
