  "title": "Morgan Stanley says the fundamentals on uranium haven't changed. Here's why the rally may soon falter.",
  "text": "<p>From videogame retailers to a once forgotten energy source — retail investors on Reddit comment boards seem to be taking some fresh interest in uranium, prices of which have been rocketing higher lately.</p><p>Investors may want to move fast to catch those gains, warns our call of the day from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>“While coal and natural gas prices are driven up by actual market tightness, uranium's underlying supply-demand fundamentals haven't meaningfully changed over the last few months to warrant this price surge,” commodity strategists Marius van Straaten and Susan Bates told clients in a note. “Although the current rally is likely to have further to run, we are not yet convinced that it can be sustained into next year.”</p><p>Joining a “wider energy rally,” uranium's spot price has gained 20% since August at $39, the highest since 2015. The strategists acknowledge uranium buying by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust CA:U.UT — to keep it away from nuclear power plants — has played a key role.</p><p>Some believe Sprott ETF could do for uranium, what the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTCdid for prices of the crypto when it started buying bitcoin. Continued buying from Sprott would add to “an already very active spot market, on the back of Covid-related mine supply disruptions,” say the analysts.</p><p>But while fund buying also preceded the commodity's 2004 to 2007 bull run that drove it to nearly $140, that was against the backdrop of a “nuclear renaissance” that isn't the case now, they said. Some bulls argue prices won't dip even if that fund buying slows due to improved market liquidity that has “aided price discovery and revealed the true ‘spot' price”, said the pair.</p><p>“On the other hand, better visibility of previously hidden uranium stocks could become an overhang to the market, with outflows from physical funds also a risk,” they added.</p><p>The strategists noted that the World Nuclear Association recently is forecasting a balanced market — achieved by utility inventory drawdowns and idled mine supply returning — up to 2028. The drawdowns are seen playing a key role in the next three years.</p><p>“Only when these utility inventories are worked off materially, the real need for a higher price to incentivize the return of idled supply will become more pressing, we think,” they said. That's as supply discipline could get tough among producers like Kazatomprom UK:KAP and Canada's Cameco CCJ as spot prices keeps rising, they note.</p><p>Regardless of the risks, Morgan Stanley is medium-term bullish for uranium, forecasting prices to reach $49 a pound by 2024. “That said, the current investor-driven rally might not seamlessly transition into a ‘real' deficit-driven bull market,and we could see some price weakness in between,” said the strategists.</p><p>Here comes consumer prices and Apple's big event</p><p>Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate August consumer prices rose 0.4%, which would be the smallest since February, but twice as high as the monthly average over the past two decades.</p><p>Apple AAPL is expected to unveil its iPhone 13 lineup during its fall event that kicks off virtually at 1 p.m. Eastern.
