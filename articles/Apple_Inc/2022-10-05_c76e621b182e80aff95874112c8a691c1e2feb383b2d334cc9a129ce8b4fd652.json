  "title": "Technology:  EU Vote Freezes Out  Lightning Charger  ----  By Kim Mackrael",
  "text": "<p>   BRUSSELS -- Apple Inc. is losing its Lightning in Europe. </p><p>   European Union lawmakers backed legislation to create a common standard for charging smartphones and other portable electronics in a move that will effectively ban the sale of new products in Europe that use the company's proprietary Lightning charger port. </p><p>   The European Parliament on Tuesday voted to approve the new rules, which aim to force companies that sell portable electronic devices in the EU to ensure they are equipped with a USB-C charging port, technology that is commonly used in new laptop computers and Android phones. The aim is to have a common standard that would allow consumers to use the same cable to charge all their portable electronic devices. </p><p>   \"The common charger will finally become a reality in Europe,\" said Alex Agius Saliba, a member of the Parliament from Malta. He said the new rules \"will benefit everyone -- from frustrated consumers to our vulnerable environment.\" </p><p>   The EU legislation is a blow to Apple, which uses its Lightning ports on new iPhones. Replacement chargers for iPhones tend to be more expensive than USB-C cables. </p><p>   Apple has said the law would harm innovation and inconvenience users. </p><p></p>",
