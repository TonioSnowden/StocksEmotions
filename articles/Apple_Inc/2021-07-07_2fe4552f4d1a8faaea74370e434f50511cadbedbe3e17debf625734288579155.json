  "title": "Samsung Profit to Rise by 53%",
  "text": "<p>The South Korean firm's outlook handily topped market expectations and showed continuing strength for technology companies and especially chip makers that have seen greater pricing power amid a supply crunch.</p><p>A year ago, during the pandemic's first months, Samsung saw a double-digit percentage drop in revenue for electronics products like smartphones and televisions. But demand for components surged as people shifted more of their lives online. Results have remained strong since.</p><p>Analysts' estimates gathered by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence were about 10.9 trillion won in operating profit and 61.2 trillion won in revenue.</p><p>Samsung reports full earnings this month. The Suwon, South Korea, company is considered to be an industry bellwether because it is both a major electronics maker and a components supplier to the world's biggest tech firms such as Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp.</p><p>Samsung is likely to see its smartphone shipments decline by 20% from the previous quarter, according to Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Securities in Seoul, in a recent note to investors.</p><p>Part of that drop is due to Covid-19 outbreaks in growth markets like India, which sapped consumer demand. Some suppliers to Samsung's handset business have warned of production bottlenecks.</p>",
