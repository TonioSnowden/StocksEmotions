  "text": "<p>Time for a new leadout. That is the message to Peloton from Blackwells Capital. The activist investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41c29068-ed4f-4ecb-b7e6-79fb27cec280\">is calling</a> for the connected-fitness equipment maker to give chief executive John Foley the boot and put the company up for sale.</p> <p>Blackwells, which has a sub 5 per cent stake in Peloton, has $41bn in reasons to agitate for change. In a span of 13 months, Peloton has gone from a pandemic-era, stay-at-home darling with a market valuation of $50bn to a crisis-stricken company worth $9bn. Shares now trade below the 2019 listing price of $29.</p> <p>It makes sense that demand for Peloton's pricey, internet-connected exercise bikes and even pricier treadmills would dip as vaccinated Americans returned to the office and gyms reopened. That is not something the company can control. But product recalls have also hurt its image and sales. So has competition from the likes of SoulCycle, NordicTrack, Hydrow and Mirror.</p> <p>Efforts to raise production were costly and ineffective. These include the $420m acquisition of exercise equipment maker, Precor, in December 2020 and the decision last year to spend $400m to build a factory in the US.</p> <p>Those actions added to the company's cash burn. It reported a negative operating cash flow of $561m in its last fiscal quarter. In November it raised $1bn via a discounted share sale.</p> <p>Lex has previously <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec75cfd6-ba1e-37c4-ab71-abacb9a7f788\">warned</a> that the company's business model — which is dependent on equipment sales to drive sales and profit growth — was difficult to scale. Four-fifths of Peloton's revenues come from equipment sales. Longstanding customers, however loyal, are not going to buy new bikes or treadmills every year.</p> <p>Stuck with excess inventories and falling demand, the lossmaking company has few options. It has reportedly already halted production on some products and is considering downsizing its workforce. </p> <p>Peloton could be a good data purchase for a tech company such as Alphabet or Apple, which is interested in fitness hardware. But even they may think twice about the price. Some 6.2m people subscribe to Peloton's digital workout classes. At the current market capitalisation of $9bn, that works out to around $1,450 per customer. </p> <p>Executives have to recognise the need for change. A dual-class share structure gives Foley and other insiders majority control over the company's voting rights. Blackwells faces an uphill ride in its worthwhile campaign. </p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
