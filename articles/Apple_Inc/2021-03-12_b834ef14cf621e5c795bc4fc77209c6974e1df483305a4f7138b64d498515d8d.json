  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.57 points, or 0.6%, to 32485.59, notching its 12th record close of the year. The jump marked the Dow's fifth consecutive session of gains.</p><p>Investors' demand for stocks, particularly growth companies, has revived this week as bond markets have stabilized, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling from an intraday high of 1.607% on Monday. On Thursday, the yield ticked up slightly to 1.525% from 1.520% Wednesday. Yields climb as bond prices fall.</p><p>\"Some calm has come back into the bond market,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. \"And that's brought some more calm and confidence from equity investors.\"</p><p>Investors view the recent pullback in technology stocks as a buying opportunity, he added. \"Sure, cyclicals might do better as the economy opens up, but tech isn't going anywhere,\" Mr. Detrick said.</p><p>The gains in tech stocks have helped the Nasdaq trim its recent losses. The index is just 4.9% from its Feb. 12 record, after sliding into correction territory -- a fall of at least 10% from a recent high -- on Monday.</p><p>The sharp moves in bond yields were partly fueled by uncertainty over how the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill would ripple through the U.S. economy.</p><p>President Biden signed the bill into law Thursday. The first direct payments to Americans authorized under the package are expected to be deposited into bank accounts as soon as this weekend.</p><p>Concerns that the size of the stimulus would lift inflation beyond the Federal Reserve 's comfort zone and trigger an increase in interest rates recently prompted yields to rise.</p><p>That sapped appetite for shares of tech companies, which had benefited from an extended spell of low rates.</p><p>At the same time, optimism about the economic outlook has bolstered demand for shares of companies that would benefit from a relaxation of lockdowns.</p><p>Recently released muted inflation data have calmed nerves about the outlook for rates. This week, new data showed that the consumer-price index, which measures what consumers pay for everyday items, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in February, in line with expectations.</p><p>Still, bond yields will likely remain volatile, shifting momentum between different segments of the stock market, said Monica Defend, head of research at French asset manager Amundi.</p><p>\"Eventually it should be positive for the equity market if we have a bit more inflation, a bit more growth,\" she said.</p><p>The market's FAANG stocks -- Facebook , Amazon.com , Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet -- all soared Thursday, with Netflix in particular gaining the most by adding $18.52, or 3.7%, to $523.06. Facebook and Alphabet both also jumped by more than 3%.</p><p>Other growth stocks also bounced higher. Electric-vehicle maker Tesla added $31.54, or 4.7%, to finish at $699.60, while data-mining firm Palantir Technologies gained $1.98, or 8%, to $26.73.</p><p>Thursday's stock rally also saw rebounds in other industries, with eight of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors rising. The financials, utilities and consumer staples groups posted losses. In total, almost 300 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 finished the day higher. Companies including online marketplace Etsy and Occidental Petroleum jumped, rising 7.2% and 5.5%, respectively.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of videogame retailer and online-trading sensation GameStop lost $5, or 1.9% to $260. Volatility has returned in recent sessions to the meme stocks that are the darlings of individual investors who gather on internet forums.</p><p>U.S. investors have been watching the labor market for signals about how quickly the economy is improving as Covid-19 vaccines continue to roll out. On Thursday, fresh data showed that jobless claims continued to ease. Filings for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 last week, nearing their lowest level since the coronavirus pandemic caused widespread layoffs across the country.</p><p>In overseas markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.5% after the European Central Bank said it would raise the pace of its purchases of eurozone debt after a recent rise in bond yields. The jump marked four consecutive days of increases for the index.</p><p>\"The eurozone can't afford tightening financial conditions, and we've been importing that from the higher rates in the U.S.,\" Ms. Defend said before the rate decision. \"It is something the ECB is looking at as a matter of concern.\"</p><p>The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.4% in its biggest one-day rise since October. Early Friday, the Chinese benchmark was down 0.4%, Japan's Nikkei was up 1% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.9%.</p>",
