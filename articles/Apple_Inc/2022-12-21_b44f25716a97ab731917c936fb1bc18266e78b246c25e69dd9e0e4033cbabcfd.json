  "text": "<p> The National Football League is in advanced talks on a deal with Google's YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc., for exclusive rights to \"NFL Sunday Ticket,\" a subscription-only package that allows football fans to watch most Sunday afternoon games, people familiar with the matter said. </p> <p> An agreement could be reached as early as Wednesday following a meeting of NFL owners who are required to approve rights deals. </p> <p> Terms being discussed for the agreement couldn't immediately be learned. </p> <p> Satellite broadcaster DirecTV, which is majority owned by AT&amp;T Inc., currently pays $1.5 billion annually for \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" rights, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The package allows subscribers to view all \"out of market\" Sunday afternoon games, meaning games that don't involve their local teams. </p> <p> A potential move of \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" to YouTube is further evidence of major sports migrating from traditional TV, which has been hit by cord-cutting, to streaming and tech companies who are willing to spend heavily on content. </p> <p> Amazon.com Inc. has its own NFL deal, while Apple Inc. streams some Major League Baseball games and has a new deal for Major League Soccer. Amazon and Apple also kicked the tires on Sunday Ticket. </p> <p> The addition of \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" would provide a boost to YouTube's streaming efforts as the video platform attempts to broaden beyond advertising sales into subscription revenue. </p> <p> YouTube's advertising business declined on a yearly basis for the first time in the third quarter, following a streak of rapid growth during the pandemic. </p> <p> Under the scenario being discussed, NFL games would be available to be streamed on two subscription services, YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels, next season. </p> <p> YouTube has recently grown into a popular destination for television watchers, overtaking Netflix Inc. as the most viewed streaming service on TVs for the first time this year, according to Nielsen data. </p> <p> YouTube TV, a $64.99-per-month online bundle of cable channels, crossed more than five million subscriptions and trial accounts in June, according to the company. Primetime Channels, which launched in November, allows viewers to individually subscribe to more than 30 streaming services. </p> <p> \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" would be offered as an add-on to both services, the people familiar with potential agreement said. </p> <p> DirecTV has experienced subscriber declines that made it difficult to justify the costs of holding onto \"NFL Sunday Ticket.\" </p> <p> The NFL has been eager to strike media partnerships with tech companies, which expands the pool of potential bidders every time rights deals come up for negotiation. </p> <p> This season, Amazon's Prime Video streaming service became the exclusive national home for the NFL's \"Thursday Night Football\" package at an average annual price of $1.2 billion a season, a big increase from what Fox Corp. previously paid for the same rights. </p> <p> In June, Apple reached a 10-year agreement with Major League Soccer worth at least $2.5 billion to stream games on its TV+ platform. Apple also streams Major League Baseball on Friday nights during the regular season. </p> <p> Even Netflix, which has said it isn't interested in acquiring major sports rights for its streaming service, has explored acquiring rights to niche sports and even taking ownership stakes in leagues. Traditional TV networks still hold major NFL rights deals. CBS and Fox broadcast Sunday games, while NBC and ESPN air prime-time games on Sunday and Monday, respectively. The NFL has signed long-term deals with its partners that altogether are valued at over $100 billion. </p> <p> There are signs that some traditional media companies are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of sports-rights deals, especially given the high sums tech companies are willing to pay. ESPN dropped out of the mix for \"NFL Sunday Ticket,\" partly because of the steep price tag the league was seeking, people familiar with the matter said. </p> <p> YouTube TV already offers sports to its customers by carrying channels such as Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN. But striking a rights deal with a major league makes Google a much bigger player in sports. </p> <p> ---</p> <p> Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p> <pre> </pre> <p> A Business &amp; Finance article in some editions Wednesday about NFL Sunday Ticket was written by Joe Flint and Miles Kruppa.
