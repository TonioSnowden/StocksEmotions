  "text": "<p>Toyota Motor Corp. is also adjusting production at some of its factories in China because of Covid-19 disruptions, spokesman Tomoki Yoshida said.</p><p>Honda's automotive plant in Wuhan in central China partially resumed production on Wednesday after closing for two days because many workers were locked down, spokesman Atsuki Hina said. A Honda factory in Chongqing that produces lawn mowers and generator engines has halted production since Nov. 10 because of a Covid-19 outbreak, he said. The car maker is starting to see disruption in its supply chain, though the scale is still limited, he said.</p><p>The production halts are the latest examples of economic costs from Beijing's continued rigid Covid-19 curbs and underscore how supply-chain disruptions are bubbling up yet again in China. Under China's zero-Covid policy and repeated lockdowns, factories are cutting back on output while worker and student protests have spread in the country.</p><p>At the world's largest iPhone factory in central China, run by Foxconn Technology Group, a Covid-19 outbreak that started in October resulted in thousands of workers fleeing and violent clashes between workers and police. Apple Inc. said in November that shipments of its high-end iPhone models would be lower than expected because of the disruptions.</p><p>This year, the car industry suffered from supply-chain disruptions in China, when automotive hubs such as Shanghai and parts of the northeastern province of Jilin were locked down for months.</p><p>The number of Covid-19 infections reported by China's health authorities has reached almost 40,000 a day recently, with the most serious outbreaks in Guangdong, Beijing and Chongqing.</p><p>In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, Chinese electric-vehicle startup Xpeng Inc. has been operating its plant in a closed-loop setup, a spokeswoman said -- which means largely keeping the site shut off from the outside world and allowing workers to only move between their lodgings and the production lines. Xpeng is also experiencing a component shortage that has affected vehicle production, she said.</p><p>Some multinational companies are concerned about economic fallout from the latest protests. Protests could spread and \"that could impact various industries -- first and foremost, that could hit the supply chain yet again,\" Kengo Sakurada, the chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives, a major Japanese business lobby, said this week.</p><p>Companies are also reviewing their sourcing reliance on China.</p><p>Airbus SE, the world's biggest plane maker, is assessing how to dual-source products it buys from Chinese suppliers amid logistical challenges caused by China's zero-Covid policy as well as heightened political tensions between China and the West, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said.</p><p>China's Covid lockdowns are affecting Airbus's local suppliers further down its supply chain and weighing on the plane maker's ability to deliver aircraft on time, Mr. Faury said Tuesday.</p><p>Indexes that gauge activity in China's manufacturing, services and construction industries dropped more than expected in November, data released Wednesday showed.</p><p>---</p><p>River Davis and Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p>",
