  "text": "<p>Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac0920c7-5394-4e02-b95d-b6d61b0c2b4b\">began evacuating civilians</a> from some of its hardest-hit urban areas today after tentative signs that a ceasefire with Russian forces was holding up for the first time.</p> <p>After several failed attempts to allow civilians to escape frontline fighting in recent days, Russia and Ukraine said they had agreed to avoid clashes in defined areas from 9am to 9pm, including the city of Sumy.</p> <p>The UN has raised its estimate of the number of people now displaced by the war to 2mn. EU officials said they expected as many as 5mn refugees, in what would be the biggest movement of people across Europe in more than half a century.</p> <p>Moscow meanwhile has warned the west that bans on its energy exports would lead to a “catastrophic” rise in the oil price to $300 a barrel.</p> <p>Directly addressing the potential ban by the US and its allies, Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak warned it could lead to a more than doubling of the price of oil. He also said Russia had the option of switching off gas supplies to Europe via the original Nord Stream pipeline, but had chosen not to so far because “no one will benefit”.</p> <p>Oil markets were calmer today following yesterday's extreme volatility that saw crude oil prices rise to near $140 a barrel before falling back to nearer $120, after Germany said it opposed the proposed international ban of Russian oil imports.</p> <p>Crude oil, the international benchmark, is today trading up $2.46 a barrel at $125.64. WTI, the US benchmark, gained $2.16 to $121.56 a barrel.</p> <h1>More on Ukraine</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis: </strong>As the US considers banning the import of Russian oil, our economics editor Chris Giles assesses what such a move <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc513e50-eb68-43aa-b718-fcb4f8031c03\">would mean for the global economy</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Military Briefing:</strong> Russia is increasingly using <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcbe7584-bf5d-46e2-bdd6-987f4b478b1f\">long-range missiles and rockets</a> to target cities as its advance stalls, particularly in the north and north-east.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Markets Briefing:</strong> Wheat and nickel futures prices hit record highs today as the war in Ukraine leads to tumult in commodities market.
