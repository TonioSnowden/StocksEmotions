  "text": "<p>The decline of respectability as an ideal has been at the center of two tech-world sagas unfolding in recent weeks: the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and Elon Musk's tumultuous takeover of Twitter. In this context, the most telling detail in the FTX saga doesn't have to do with dubious tokens or suspicious accounting. Rather, it involves League of Legends, the massive multiplayer online game that is a favorite of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In September, the tech venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital published a profile of \"SBF\" on its website, explaining how the crypto prodigy convinced the firm to invest some $200 million during a Zoom meeting—while playing League of Legends the whole time.</p><p>What's significant isn't just that the now 30-year-old entrepreneur didn't think it necessary to give the deal his full attention. It's that Sequoia published this detail in an article meant to advertise its FTX investment. (The article was taken down after the firm began to collapse in early November.) Far from seeing Mr. Bankman-Fried's gaming as a worrisome example of distraction and disrespect, Sequoia was impressed by it and expected readers to have the same reaction.</p><p>This expectation makes a kind of sense. Respect is rooted in the idea of equality; being respectful in outward, visible ways—for instance, by giving someone your full attention when they're talking—is a signal that you regard them as a peer. But Silicon Valley has always looked for unicorns and disruptors, who by definition don't respect the way that others do things. Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia, became one of the first investors in Apple in the 1970s entirely on the strength of his faith in Steve Jobs. One of the things that appealed to him about Jobs, Valentine recalled, was that \"he did a number of weird things…on purpose just to shock people.\"</p><p>The example he gives was that Jobs was \"a fruitarian or a vegetarian,\" which seems unremarkable by today's standards; Jobs was never known to play Pong during important meetings. But at the time, it was enough to signal rejection of the status quo, which is Silicon Valley's prime directive. It's the same reason why Mark Zuckerberg wore hoodies instead of suits and why Mr. Bankman-Fried played a game while pitching investors. When the goal is to shake things up, being respectable is a liability.</p><p>What does it mean—or what did it mean—to be respectable? In his classic 1905 study \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\" the German sociologist Max Weber argued that in capitalist societies, business was more than a way of making a living. Rather, accumulating wealth was a moral calling, a way of justifying one's time on Earth. That is why, unlike the rich noblemen of earlier eras, the \"bourgeois businessman\" always remained \"within the bounds of formal correctness,\" making sure that \"his moral conduct was spotless,\" Weber wrote.</p><p>The 19th-century steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie is a classic example. One of the richest men who ever lived, Carnegie was famously disciplined, sober and high-minded. In his \"Autobiography,\" published in 1920 after his death, he placed a great premium on respectability, writing that he and his brother Tom \"could not help growing up respectable characters,\" given how much their mother loathed \"anything low, mean, deceitful, shifty, coarse, underhand or gossipy.\" His definition of good conduct was simple: \"We should bow our heads in silence and obey the Judge within, asking nothing, fearing nothing, just doing our duty right along.\"</p><p>To critics of capitalism, of course, all this emphasis on duty and respectability looked like mere window-dressing. In 1845, Friedrich Engels, the close friend and collaborator of Karl Marx, observed that the businessmen he got to know in Manchester, England, were \"good husbands and family men, and have all sorts of other private virtues, and appear, in ordinary intercourse, as decent and respectable.\" Yet Engels considered them hypocrites, claiming that at heart a factory-owner was \"utterly indifferent…whether his working-men starve or not, if only he makes money.\"</p><p>It's not necessary to be a Marxist to recognize that respectability isn't the most important of values. Jesus said the same thing, comparing the powerful men of his society to \"whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.\" There is a time-honored tradition of social critics who publicly defy convention to show their contempt for a virtue that is only on the surface. The ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes used to eat with his hands, sleep outside in a ceramic wine jar and relieve himself on the street, scandalizing his contemporaries, who called him kynikos or \"dog-like\"—the origin of the term \"cynic.\" But this behavior was meant to dramatize Diogenes' commitment to genuine virtue. He made the same point by going around with a lantern during the day, explaining that he was searching for an honest man.</p><p>Cynical behavior has a different meaning when it comes from people at the top of the ladder. In the age of social media, some of the wealthiest and most famous people on Earth have found that the best way to gain even more attention is to display contempt for ordinary standards of discourse and behavior. Elon Musk has long been a master of this strategy, as when he smoked a marijuana blunt during a livestreamed interview in 2018.</p><p>Such provocations make his acquisition of Twitter a perfect match, no matter how bumpy the road has been. On Nov. 15, for instance, Mr. Musk tweeted a photograph of himself with his arms around two men, ostensibly employees of Twitter whom he had fired and then rehired. \"Welcoming back Ligma &amp; Johnson!\" Mr. Musk wrote. \"Important to admit when I'm wrong &amp; firing them was truly one of my biggest mistakes.\" The fake names make up an obscene pun that is popular online.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is it important for leaders to be respectable? Join the conversation below.</p><p>But what's objectionable isn't mainly the joke. Mr. Musk had just fired thousands of employees, about half of Twitter's workforce, and would go on to issue an ultimatum that led to the departure of hundreds more. Companies downsize all the time, of course, but when GM closed its Lordstown plant in 2019, CEO Mary Barra didn't release a statement making fun of the people she had just laid off.</p><p>In addition to throwing people out of work in the middle of a contracting tech job market, the Twitter layoffs raised doubts among users and advertisers about the site's future. A traditional CEO would acknowledge these issues, but Mr. Musk belongs to a culture in which advertising one's indifference to other people's concerns is rewarded. What better proof of being extraordinary than being able to disrespect people with impunity?</p><p>That Mr. Musk made the joke about Twitter on Twitter is highly appropriate, because no social media network has done more to hasten the era of post-respectability. On Twitter, \"trolling\" is no longer the domain of losers who, as the stereotype had it, posted insulting and offensive content while living in their parents' basements. Sometimes they occupy the most powerful positions in society.</p><p>One of Mr. Musk's most significant early decisions was to reinstate the account of former president Donald Trump, whose account was suspended following the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. So far, Mr. Trump has declined to return. Whether Twitter was right to ban the president of the United States is debatable, but it makes sense that Mr. Musk would hurry to embrace the network's most controversial user, since Mr. Trump is the ultimate example of how social media can turn negative attention into a source of power.</p><p>Mr. Trump was at odds with respectability long before Twitter, but that was where he perfected the persona that helped him to win the White House. From 2009, when he joined the network, until he was banned, Mr. Trump tweeted about 57,000 times—an average of 13 times a day for almost 12 years, including most of his presidency. Most importantly, he used Twitter for picking fights, whether it was with the government of Mexico during the 2016 campaign (\"Mexico will pay for the wall!\"), the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2018 (\"Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY\"), or his detractors in general in 2013: \"Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest—and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.\"</p><p>To anyone familiar with Mr. Trump's Twitter feed, it could not have come as a surprise that so many of the people he appointed to high-ranking positions in his administration ended up quitting or being fired. Questions of policy aside, there is a profound mismatch between Mr. Trump's anti-respectable style and the culture of institutions like Exxon, where Rex Tillerson, his first Secretary of State, had been CEO, and the U.S. military, where James Mattis, his first Secretary of Defense, had been a four-star general in the Marine Corps.</p><p>Those institutions are the opposite of democratic; they are intensely hierarchical, with clear lines of authority and deference. But they are good examples of how the insistence on respectable behavior is a way of constraining power and making it accountable. In corporate and military settings, there is an expectation that everyone, especially leaders, will act with dignity, as a sign that no individual is more powerful than the system and its rules. During World War II, when men were being killed by the thousands daily, General George S. Patton could still be disciplined by his superior, General Dwight Eisenhower, for slapping shell-shocked soldiers in the face. \"I must so seriously question your good judgment and your self-discipline as to raise serious doubts in my mind as to your future usefulness,\" Eisenhower wrote to Patton, instructing him to apologize personally to the two soldiers involved.</p><p>Eisenhower's reference to \"usefulness\" is a reminder that respectful behavior isn't only a moral issue but a practical one. When a system seems to be failing—whether it is a stagnant corporation or a stalemated government—then it is appealing to look for a leader who will openly defy that system. Messrs. Musk, Bankman-Fried and Trump all found great success by advertising their hostility to the status quo through their contempt for social and political norms.</p><p>But when it comes to actually changing things for the better, that quality becomes a liability. It is possible to win popularity and even power by inspiring contempt, but to align thousands or millions of people behind common goals, a leader needs to inspire trust. In the long run, we can only trust people we respect—and who respect us. Qualities like sobriety, regularity and restraint aren't moral, exactly, but as indicators of respect for other people, they offer a significant gauge of trustworthiness. Their disappearance from public life is a sign of our troubled times, and things are unlikely to get better until we start demanding them from our public figures once again.</p><p>The Rise and Fall of Respectability</p>",
