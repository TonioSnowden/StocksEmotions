  "title": "Neil Young Pushes Fans to Amazon Music --- Musician offers link where new subscribers can receive four months free of charge",
  "text": "<p>\"Amazon has been leading the pack in bringing Hi-Res audio to the masses, and it's a great place to enjoy my entire catalog in the highest quality available,\" Mr. Young said, referring to high-resolution audio.</p><p>He also thanked streaming services Apple Music and Qobuz for \"sticking with my High-Res music.\"</p><p>The four-months free link that Mr. Young touted appears to be a better promotion relative to what Amazon Music typically provides to new subscribers. On its website, Amazon Music offers both Prime and non-Prime members the option for 30 days free before charging a monthly fee.</p><p>Representatives for Mr. Young and Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Streaming services that carry Mr. Young's music have been promoting it in the days since he pulled his content from Spotify. Hi-fi streaming service Tidal, which Mr. Young has championed for its sound quality, retweeted a fan's observation: \"Love that Neil Young is trending on Tidal\" and then shared a meme welcoming fresh recruits.</p><p>Apple Music tweeted: \"It's always a good idea to stream @NeilYoungNYA,\" while including a link to its Neil Young Essentials playlist.</p><p>Satellite-radio company SiriusXM, a unit of Liberty Media Corp., announced last week the return of \"Neil Young Radio,\" a satellite and streamed channel featuring Mr. Young introducing his songs and telling stories.</p><p>Spotify is the world's most popular music subscription streaming service, capturing 31% of the market in the second quarter of 2021, according to a report from MIDiA Research. Apple Inc.'s streaming-music service has a 15% market share and Amazon Music is third, capturing 13% of the market.</p><p>In posts to his website last week Mr. Young thanked his label and Hipgnosis Songs Fund Ltd., which bought 50% of his publishing copyrights last year, for supporting his decision to pull his music from Spotify. He highlighted that 60% of his streaming income comes from the service.</p><p>But streams of Mr. Young's music increased for the week ending Jan. 27, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music, which powers the Billboard charts. On-demand streams rose 11% from the week before, despite his music being off of Spotify for two of the period's days. Total album sales, including physical copies and digital downloads, rose 50%, as some fans opted to purchase Mr. Young's music on iTunes.</p><p>Mr. Young touting other streaming services comes as other artists, including folk singer Joni Mitchell and rocker Nils Lofgren have sought to remove their music from Spotify.</p><p>Mr. Rogan late Sunday apologized and said he aimed to be more balanced and informed about controversial topics and guests. He said his show has grown \"out of control\" and said, \"If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,\" referring to the growing backlash against him and Spotify.</p><p>\"It's a strange responsibility to have this many viewers and listeners,\" Mr. Rogan said in a 10-minute video posted on Instagram. \"It's nothing that I've prepared for. I'm going to do my best to balance things out.\"</p><p>Spotify earlier Sunday made public its policies, which it didn't alter, and created a Covid-19 information hub.</p><p>\"We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,\" said Chief Executive Daniel Ek in a blog post Sunday. \"It's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time.\"</p><p>News Corp's Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a content partnership with Spotify's Gimlet Media unit.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
