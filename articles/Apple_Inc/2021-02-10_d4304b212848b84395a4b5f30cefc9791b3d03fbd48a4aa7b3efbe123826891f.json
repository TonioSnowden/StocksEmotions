  "title": "Kaepernick Connects With Socially Driven SPAC  ----  By Andrew Beaton",
  "text": "<p>   Colin Kaepernick is leading a group taking a blank-check company public, as the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback turned activist tries to bring his social-justice causes to the booming SPAC industry. </p><p>   Mr. Kaepernick will serve as the co-chairman of Mission Advancement Corp., which will seek to raise as much as $287.5 million in an initial public offering, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. </p><p>   Mission Advancement says it will emphasize the racial and diversity issues Mr. Kaepernick has championed on and off the field through its investment in the growing environmental, social and governance investment field. It aims to target consumer businesses with an enterprise value of more than $1 billion. </p><p>   Mission Advancement will be co-chaired by Jahm Najafi, who runs the private-equity firm Najafi Cos. and is a minority owner in the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns. Together, they lead a board that is made up of members who are majority female and 100% Black, indigenous and people of color. Other board members include Katie Beauchamp, chief executive and co-founder of Birchbox, and Omar Johnson, a former executive at Apple Inc. and Beats by Dre. </p><p>   The sponsorship money is coming from Najafi Cos. and Mr. Kaepernick, and they intend to invest in a business that \"delivers a significant impact financially, culturally and socially,\" the filing says. </p><p>   Other listed advisers to the company include award-winning director Ava DuVernay, who is leading a Netflix series on Mr. Kaepernick's youth, and Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. </p><p>   Mr. Kaepernick joins the flood of people creating blank-check companies that are also known as special-purpose acquisition companies. The model is based on going public and raising large sums before acquiring a business that has grown in popularity, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Notable SPAC formations recently have involved British billionaire Richard Branson and former House Speaker Paul Ryan. </p><p>   Mr. Kaepernick, 33 years old, last played in the NFL in 2016, the season he launched player protests during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and systemic racism. The movement kicked off years of political controversy for the league, especially as Mr. Kaepernick went unsigned after that season. Later, Mr. Kaepernick settled a multimillion-dollar grievance with the NFL that alleged the league and its 32 teams colluded to keep him unsigned over his political views. </p><p></p>",
