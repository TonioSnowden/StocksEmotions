  "text": "<p><strong>I'm hosting a big group of family and friends for Christmas this year and I want to create a Christmas Day table to impress. Can you help?</strong></p> <p>A preliminary side note from me, before we get into the good stuff: hosting over the festive season can bring on all sorts of emotions. You might feel delighted at the prospect of having many loved ones under one roof, but there could be times when you'll want to hide in the loo, paper crown lowered over your eyes, mouth open in a silent scream.</p> <p>This is totally normal. We are bombarded with images of perfect Christmas interiors and while there is much inspiration to be taken from these images, it can also all feel rather daunting. I think the key thing to remember is to have fun with the creativity that Christmas can and should bring out in all of us.</p> <p>We have spent the past two Christmases in the country, but this year we will spend the actual day in our cottage for the first time, and we'll be cooking Christmas dinner to boot. The thought of this makes me extremely excited because I love nothing more than those precious few days before the big day itself. A pootle around the shops picking up last-minute ingredients, filling the fridge with all manner of necessary and unnecessary food items, decking the very last of the halls and, of course, planning the Christmas table.</p> <p>For me, the Christmas Day table should be my most marvellous one of the year. I reach into the cabinet and bring out our most beloved bits of china and glass. Not to mention all the other bits, because I seem to have a habit of accumulating beautiful odds and ends that don't get used enough. Christmas is their time to shine. That urn-shaped silver mustard pot? Get over here. The pair of shell-encrusted salt cellars? Come on down!</p> <p>Let's start at base level: the tablecloth. I like the idea of a cloth that feels festive and jolly, but one that can outstay its Christmas welcome and be used at other times of the year, too. <a href=\"https://cabanamagazine.com/collections/table-linen/products/esmerelda-table-linen\">Cabana's Esmerelda tablecloth</a> made with India-based brand D'Ascoli, inspired by the elegant wall frescoes in Rajput palaces, features an exuberant floral design in a medley of greens and reds. It will work throughout the year, but feels more than celebratory enough to be enjoyed now.</p> <p>I also appreciate the effect a plainer tablecloth can bring. I recently bought a forest green tablecloth with white stripes from <a href=\"https://rebeccaudall.com/collections/tablecloths-runners/products/clara-striped-linen-tablecloth-fir-green\">Rebecca Udall</a>, a North Yorkshire brand that specialises in contemporary European homeware. I plan to pair it with block-printed napkins in clashing colours, because I never want things to match, and a variety of antique plates, serving dishes and old cutlery.</p> <p>I want old, beautiful and unusual things with patina on my table at all times of the year, but particularly at Christmastime. This could mean trays, tureens, dishes, platters, teacups . . . I noticed recently on 1stdibs a c<a href=\"https://www.1stdibs.com/en-gb/furniture/dining-entertaining/tureens/antique-english-minton-majolica-porcelain-figural-duck-rabbit-tureen-ca-1890/id-f_29861882/\">1890 Minton majolica tureen</a> shaped like an ivy-covered basket. What an addition to my festive table this would be.</p> <p>Of course, tureens can be picked up all over the place, from junk shops to local auctions. Or try a website such as <a href=\"https://www.tat-london.co.uk/\">Tat London</a> for unique vintage tableware. I've had my eye on a mesmerising Staffordshire teapot made from green agateware pottery.</p> <p>In my humble opinion, the two key pillars for a successfully atmospheric Christmas table are candlelight and natural decorations. Consider laying a garland down the middle of your table, or bookending with large vases filled with holly, crab apple branches or other festive greenery. I like candlesticks at different heights, and at this time of year I love an abundance of tea lights, too, which we pop into small coloured glass beakers.</p> <p>For place settings, a simple cracker laid across a plate usually does the trick in my book, but I could get behind something more decorative, such as a pomegranate brushed with gold leaf. A handwritten place card always adds a nice touch.</p> <p>Coming back to decorative (and frivolous?) odds and ends: I've been admiring a Bohemian flashed red and clear glass decanter at<a href=\"https://guinevere.co.uk/product/accessories/barware/bohemian-flashed-red-and-clear-glass-decanter/\"> Guinevere Antiques</a>. I love red glass at Christmas.</p> <p>What I'm really pining for, however, is the pair of Georgian papier-mâché wine bottle coasters I noticed in the window of <a href=\"https://www.baggottantiques.com/en-GB/antique-wine-spirits-accessories/antique-pair-of-georgian-papier-mach-wine-coasters/prod_10683#.Y5Nn0nbP2Ul\">Baggott Antiques</a> in Stow-on-the-Wold the other week: finished in black lacquer with a broad gilt border decorated with a bold trompe-l'oeil Greek key, they're more me than me. I hadn't given wine coasters much thought until these stopped me in my tracks. Surely I could make just a little more space on my Christmas table?</p> <p>As during the rest of the year, I enjoy contrasts at Christmas: glimmering silver dishes and dark linens, coloured glassware and glowing white lights, crisp napkins and bashed old china. There are no rules. Just make sure everyone has enough to eat and drink, and go overboard with the candlelight and greenery: you won't regret it.</p> <p><em>If you have a question for Luke about design and stylish living, email him at </em><a href=\"mailto:lukeedward.hall@ft.com\"><em>lukeedward.hall@ft.com</em></a><em>.
