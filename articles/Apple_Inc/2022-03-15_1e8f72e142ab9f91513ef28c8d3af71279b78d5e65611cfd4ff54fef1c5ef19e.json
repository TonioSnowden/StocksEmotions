  "title": "World News: Covid Measures Halt Production at Chinese Factory Hubs",
  "text": "<p>The government placed the city into lockdown for at least a week and said everyone in the city would have to undergo three rounds of testing after 86 new cases of domestic Covid-19 infections were detected Sunday.</p><p>While China's case numbers are tiny by global standards, the country has adopted a zero-Covid policy that aims at nipping all outbreaks in the bud through testing and lockdowns.</p><p>Over the past two years, the world's second-biggest economy has repeatedly locked down entire cities or sections of them, ordering factories to suspend operations as people stay home.</p><p>Such suspensions have typically lasted for several weeks as authorities worked to bring down the number of infections, causing production snags in the semiconductor, automobile and other industries.</p><p>Officials didn't say when the lockdowns would end; in Shenzhen, officials said they would decide whether the lockdown needs to be extended after a week based on the state of the pandemic then. In recent days, daily Covid-19 infection numbers in China have hit levels not seen since early 2020.</p><p>Over the past two years, companies have been grappling with various supply disruptions stemming from the pandemic, including a major chip shortage. Most recently, they have been facing fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The disruption in Shenzhen came less than a week after Apple showed off new products including the latest version of its budget iPhone SE, which features high-speed fifth-generation, or 5G, communications, and the high-end Mac Studio computer.</p><p>Foxconn's sites in Shenzhen, in southern China, produce some iPhones as well as iPads and computers. The majority of iPhones, however, are made at a factory in central Henan province. Foxconn said it would aim to keep up production by shifting work to other plants in China.</p><p>Printed circuit-board maker Unimicron Technology Corp. said its Shenzhen subsidiary halted production Monday morning. Unimicron is also a major Apple supplier but doesn't currently handle Apple-related orders in Shenzhen, according to Apple's latest supplier list.</p><p>At least six other companies on the Apple list are based in Shenzhen. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The city is home to many Chinese manufacturing giants including telecommunication equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. and electric-vehicle maker BYD Co., which produces electric cars and batteries.</p><p>Some businesses in Shenzhen deemed essential remained open. Huawei's offices in Shenzhen were among those that continued to operate in line with local virus-control measures, a company spokeswoman said.</p><p>More than 40 Taiwan-based makers of semiconductors and other electronic components filed announcements with the Taiwan Stock Exchange on Monday saying they were temporarily closing facilities in Shenzhen and nearby Dongguan.</p><p>---</p><p>Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.</p>",
