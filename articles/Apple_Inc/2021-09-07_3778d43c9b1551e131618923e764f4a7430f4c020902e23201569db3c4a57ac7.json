  "title": "Ford Hires Apple's Doug Field to Advance Technology Role; Executive played role in developing Tesla's Model 3 compact car and has been working on iPhone maker's car project",
  "text": "<p>\"This is just a monumental moment in time—a moment in time that I think we have now to really remake a 118-year-old company,\" Mr. Farley told reporters. Mr. Field joins the company as chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer reporting directly to the CEO.</p><p>Apple's car project has been an object of curiosity and concern throughout the auto industry since The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2015 about the secret effort code-named Project Titan. Initially, it was believed the company was aiming to come out with an electric vehicle as soon as 2020, but Apple's ambitions were questioned as timelines slipped, the project's leadership turned over and its focus seemed to narrow to developing technology around driverless cars.</p><p>Apple's rehiring of Mr. Field in 2018 sparked renewed excitement among some observers. By the end of last year, Apple was talking with suppliers about a car, again targeting production within a few years. Yet Apple has remained coy about its plans.</p><p>\"We're grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter,\" Apple said.</p><p>Mr. Field's biggest contribution to the business of car making came at Tesla, whereas engineering chief he worked to develop the Model 3 compact electric car that has fueled the Palo Alto, Calif., auto maker's profits and helped make the case that EVs are the future.</p><p>But more than being just an electric car, the Model 3 is in many ways a super computer on wheels, developed from day one with software in mind. Those capabilities allow Tesla to change the vehicle's functions after the car has rolled out of the factory and has led many to envision cars becoming like smartphones.</p><p>Under Mr. Farley, who became CEO a year ago, Ford aims to expand its ability to offer digital services for which customers are willing to pay extra, which he says should generate recurring revenue.</p><p>Ford now offers a software program that allows businesses to digitally monitor their vehicle fleets to see which might need an oil change. Mr. Farley has said he wants to roll out more such services to Ford's large base of commercial-fleet customers, especially as it introduces more electric models. Ford recently acquired a startup that can help businesses manage electric-vehicle charging.</p><p>Mr. Farley said Mr. Field had an understanding of both the tech world and automotive, where digital features and services are integrated into vehicles that must meet stringent safety and durability standards.</p><p>\"There are a lot of leaders in the technology field who know a lot about embedded systems, but a much shorter list of people who know about safety-critical systems and other realities that we face in moving people,\" Mr. Farley said in an interview.</p><p>Bringing in outside talent, however, isn't always easy for a top company with entrenched ways of doing things, especially Ford and its legacy of corporate knife fights. In 2017, Ford drew attention for luring Uber Technologies Inc. executive Sherif Marakby back to Ford to oversee new technologies. He departed last year for a senior role at auto supplier Magna International.</p><p>The company has invested heavily in autonomous-vehicle technology startup Argo AI, led by Bryan Salesky, a former engineer behind Alphabet Inc.'s original driverless car program.</p><p>Mr. Field began his engineering career at Ford in 1987 before detouring into a career that took him to the avant-garde of personal transportation. He was an executive at Segway, which developed a self-balancing electric scooter, before being recruited to Apple under the late Steve Jobs. At Apple, he oversaw the development of Macs before Elon Musk recruited him to Tesla in 2013 to work on product development.</p><p>At Tesla, he faced the challenge of finding ways to make the company's vehicles more affordable. Mr. Musk had seen success with the Model S luxury sedan but wanted the Model 3 to appeal to mainstream buyers with a price starting at $35,000. The Model S typically sold for around $100,000.</p><p>The Model 3 arrived in 2017, though was shy of achieving the $35,000 goal. Still, the success has helped ignite broader investor excitement about the electrification of the automobile, sending Tesla shares soaring and making it the world's most valuable car company even though it has fewer sales and less profit than other car makers.</p><p>Mr. Field said he was attracted to Ford in part because of his view that advances in technology like driverless cars and electric vehicles still require industrial expertise and scale.</p><p>\"It's awfully fashionable to start either autonomy companies or car companies,\" he said in an interview. \"Many of them won't have the staying power, the resources, the capabilities. Making vehicles is actually really hard.\"</p><p>He was also persuaded after meeting with leaders, such as Mr. Farley, that Ford had changed since he last worked there. \"There's a resolve there, there's a passion there and there's a humility and willingness to change that is really, really unusual,\" Mr. Field said. \"And I think that's ultimately what made this an interesting opportunity…if you can combine these breakthrough technologies, with the kind of capabilities Ford has in terms of their loyal customers and their scale. This would change everything in the industry.\"</p><p>Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com</p><p>Ford Hires Apple's Doug Field to Advance Technology Role</p>",
