  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Eating & Drinking -- On Wine:  Non-Alcoholic Wines  Fit for Holiday Fetes  ----  By Lettie Teague",
  "text": "<p>\n  As we celebrate the season with family and friends, it's likely that some who gather may not be able or willing to drink alcohol. But is there a wine that is non-alcoholic and still delicious -- even fun? </p><p>\n  The non-alcoholic wine category has grown exponentially in recent years. NielsenIQ reports that retail sales of wines in this category were almost 40% higher in the last year than they were in the previous 12 months. </p><p>\n  Confusingly, terminology and labeling laws vary from country to country. In the U.S., a wine labeled alcohol free was never a fully fermented wine, whereas wines labeled de-alcoholized or non-alcoholic did have at least some fermentation but then had the alcohol removed. In France and other countries, a wine that would be labeled de-alcoholized in the U.S. can be labeled alcohol-free, just as long as it contains less than one half of 1% alcohol. </p><p>\n  There are several ways of de-alcoholizing wine. In one of the most common, reverse osmosis, alcohol is separated from the flavor compounds of wine by means of a membrane; sometimes water is added back for balance. Other methods include vacuum distillation and a spinning cone column, by which alcohol is removed via centrifugal force. </p><p>\n  Unlike \"regular\" wines, the wines I purchased for this column included nutrition information on their back labels, such as calorie count and grams of fat, protein and carbohydrates. (The amount of alcohol, whether zero or \"less than one half of one percent,\" appeared on the front.) Those interested in the grape content of a no-/low-alcohol wine will often find that information elusive. Some bottles in my tasting cited specific grapes or, more vaguely, \"European grape varieties\"; others simply listed \"concentrated, rectified grape must\" or \"grape juice concentrate\" -- along with less-than-savory-sounding stuff such as sodium benzoate (a preservative). </p><p>\n  Every bottle I bought also bore a suggested serving size. Though the bottles were all the same size (750 mL), these ranged surprisingly widely -- from two servings per bottle to 7 1/2, which seemed like a social as well as a mathematical challenge to me. </p><p>\n  A smaller serving size enables producers to tout a lower calorie count. Perhaps they're presuming that a significant segment of their audience is teetotaling in the interest of slimming? The Perle Rose de Chavin alcohol free rose is only 30 calories a serving -- at 7.5 servings per bottle -- while a bottle of the 2020 Ariel Chardonnay Premium Dealcoholized Wine equals three servings of 45 calories each. In some cases the math got even stranger. The neck card on a bottle of Ravishing Rose Almost Zero De-Alcoholized Wine noted that a drinker would have to down 38 glasses of the nearly-alcohol-free wine to equal the alcohol level of one glass of regular (12.5%) wine, which struck me as an odd selling point. </p><p>\n  Created in 1985 and owned by J. Lohr Vineyards &amp; Wines of California, Ariel wines are some of the most visible and findable de-alcoholized wines. According to the claim on the back label, \"Ariel is the only de-alcoholized wine to win a gold medal against wines with alcohol.\" Never mind that the wine in question, Ariel Blanc, won that medal over three decades ago and is no longer in the Ariel line. </p><p>\n  Ariel wines can be found in grocery stores, wine shops and liquor stores as well as on Amazon, where I bought bottles of the 2020 Ariel Chardonnay Premium Dealcoholized Wine and 2020 Ariel Cabernet Sauvignon Premium Dealcoholized Wine, which came in a two-pack for $34.64. (Amazon is a boon for those seeking wines in this category, as it can be hard to find a good selection in local stores. It's also worth noting that prices can vary pretty widely from one retail source to another.) </p><p>\n  I tasted a few other no-/low-alcohol varietal wines, including the St. Regis Cabernet Sauvignon De-Alcoholized ($13) and the Fre Chardonnay Alcohol-Removed Wine ($7). Not one tasted like its named grape variety to me. While the aromas of the Chardonnays were vaguely Chardonnay-esque with notes of yellow apple and pear, the Ariel Cabernet smelled and tasted like planks of wood -- as if the producers were trying (and failing) to approximate oak. The St. Regis Cabernet tasted and smelled like some sort of cherry, not Cabernet grapes. The flavors of all the wines were flat, as if the fruit had been sucked out along with the alcohol. </p><p>\n  The sparkling wines were much more pleasurable all around. I found five I'd serve non-wine-drinking friends. The St. Regis Brut De-Alcoholized Sparkling Wine ($18), made from \"European\" Chardonnay grapes and bottled in Germany, has been around for decades and was purchased 10 years ago by Constellation Brands. It actually seemed like a very close approximation of a pleasant, slightly sweet sparkling wine. </p><p>\n  Two sparklers in my tasting came from Raventos Codorniu, a huge producer of regular Cava wines. The Codorniu Zero Brut Alcohol Free Sparkling Wine ($10) is a national brand, while the Rondel Zero Brut De-Alcoholized Sparkling Wine ($10) is only sold at Total Wine &amp; More stores and is made from \"less select\" grapes, according to a Codorniu spokesperson. The Rondel was the slightly drier of the two, but otherwise they were quite similar in flavor, with fizzy pear notes. Both were definitely fun to drink, even if they didn't taste anything like Cava to me. </p><p>\n  Two other bubblies that were just as much fun were also much more pricey. The Chateau de Fleur Champagnette ($25) from Weibel Family Winery in California was a big, juicy, semisweet drink. This \"non-alcoholic carbonated grape beverage\" is styled to look, if not actually taste, like Champagne -- though it does a fine turn as Champagnette (my new favorite word). The crisp and stylishly packaged alcohol-free Perle Rose de Chavin ($33), a pale pink wine from Pierre Chavin, came the closest of all to a wine in taste and appearance. (Both wines are completely alcohol-free.) </p><p>\n  The best of the no-/low-alcohol wines weren't trying to approximate wine at all but simply deliver the experience of a somewhat sweet, fizzy drink. And I'll give them this: Once opened, the unfinished bottles stayed fresh and fizzy in the refrigerator for days. (Was it the sodium benzoate?) For those who want to stay sober this season but still toast the holidays with some bubbly, the bottles listed below might be just the thing. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OENOFILE / NON-ALCOHOLIC (BUT FESTIVE) SPARKLING WINES FOR THE HOLIDAY TABLE </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  St. Regis Brut De-Alcoholized Sparkling Wine $18 </p><p>\n  Made from Chardonnay grapes identified only as \"European\" and bottled in Germany, St. Regis is widely available around the U.S. It's a bit sweet but very well balanced, with appealing aromas of apple and pear. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Perle Rose de Chavin Alcohol Free Sparkling Wine $33 </p><p>\n  Marked by aromas of pear and citrus, this lively, dry alcohol-free take on a sparkling French rose is as beautifully packaged as it is pricey. It also comes the closest of all these wines to delivering a \"real\" wine taste. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Chateau de Fleur Champagnette Non-Alcoholic Carbonated Grape Beverage $25 </p><p>\n  This fruity, rather sweet and decidedly full bodied California sparkler delivers the biggest fizz sensation of the five wines. \"Champagnette\" may not be the least bit subtle but it's definitely fun. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Rondel Zero Brut De-Alcoholized Sparkling Wine $10 </p><p>\n  This brand is sold only in Total Wine &amp; More stores. Made by Spanish Cava giant Raventos Codorniu from the Airen grape, it's a pleasantly fizzy no-alcohol drink -- a bit drier than its Codorniu Zero counterpart. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Codorniu Zero Brut Alcohol Free Sparkling Wine $10 </p><p>\n  Made from a slightly higher grade of Airen grapes than the aforementioned Rondel-label sparkler produced by Codorniu, this alcohol-free fizz from Spain is soft and juicy and not completely un-Cava-like. </p><p></p>",
