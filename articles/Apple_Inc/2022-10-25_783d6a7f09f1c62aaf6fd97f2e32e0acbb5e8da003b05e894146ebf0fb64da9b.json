  "title": "Spotify Boosts Subscribers and Revenue, Says 2023 Price Increases Likely; Audio streaming giant surpassed growth forecasts, increasing monthly active users by 20% to reach 456 million",
  "text": "<p>Apple Inc. on Monday increased the subscription price in the U.S. for its music service by $1 a month, the first of any major company to break from the long-held $9.99 a month for individual users. The company cited an increase in licensing costs.</p><p>\"We have the same pricing power in the U.S.,\" said Mr. Ek, adding that Spotify will aim to reach an agreement with label partners that is advantageous from both sides.</p><p>For its third quarter, Spotify reported 456 million monthly active users, up 20% from a year earlier, and above the company's guidance. Paying subscribers, Spotify's most lucrative type of customer, climbed 13% to 195 million, also exceeding the company's expectations, thanks to promotions and household plans.</p><p>Spotify shares fell nearly 6% in aftermarket trading Tuesday.</p><p>During the quarter, Spotify introduced its expansion into audiobooks, the latest move in the company's evolution from a pure-play music service to a more diversified audio business. Users can now purchase and listen to a catalog of more than 300,000 titles from independent authors and major publishers on a pay per download basis.</p><p>Mr. Ek said Apple's App Store policies have hampered the rollout of its audiobook offerings, rejecting Spotify's prompts to direct users to make purchases through a web browser instead of inside the app. The move means Apple won't be taking up to a 30% commission for downloads. Spotify has been fighting Apple over its in-app purchase policies for years.</p><p>\"This was an issue we anticipated but what we didn't anticipate was how stringent Apple would be in rejecting it,\" said Mr. Ek. \"It highlights the absurdity of the current App Store regime we're seeing at the moment.\"</p><p>An Apple spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Spotify said its results were affected by recent acquisitions including the audiobook company Findaway and the Wordle-inspired listening game Heardle.</p><p>Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com</p><p>Spotify Boosts Subscribers and Revenue, Says 2023 Price Increases Likely</p>",
