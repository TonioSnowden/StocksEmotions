  "title": "Musk's Twitter Barbs Carry  New Weight, Raise Concerns  ----  By Tim Higgins and Alexa Corse",
  "text": "<p>   For years, Elon Musk has used Twitter to provoke, pontificate and go on the offensive against criticism and perceived threats from rivals, regulators and regular folks. </p><p>   His flame-throwing has a new magnitude -- and the perception of impunity -- now that Mr. Musk owns the social-media platform where he has been a so-called super user for years. </p><p>   The world's second-richest man, who didn't respond to a request for comment, has more than 120 million Twitter followers. </p><p>   In the weeks since he purchased Twitter Inc. in October, Mr. Musk has made it clear that those who trigger his ire should be prepared for him to use it to target them. In recent days, for example, he has attacked Yoel Roth, who until about a month ago was a high-ranking Twitter executive, with unsubstantiated insinuations that he was an advocate of sexualizing children. He also called for the prosecution of Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser and the government's top infectious-disease official, based on his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   And Mr. Musk has threatened to set his rhetorical crosshairs on Twitter's advertisers, many of whom have cut or halted spending because of their concerns about his management of the company and his behavior on the platform since taking over. </p><p>   In the wake of what he called \"a massive drop in revenue\" in early November, Mr. Musk responded to a supporter's tweet suggesting he name advertisers who cut spending by vowing: \"A thermonuclear name &amp; shame is exactly what will happen if this continues.\" </p><p>   Some advertisers have been vocal about their concerns, while others have refrained from changing their spending on Twitter or discussing their worries publicly because they fear that Mr. Musk will target them for criticism, unleashing a backlash from his followers, according to ad buyers. </p><p>   \"Some marketers are afraid of drawing unwelcomed attention from Elon,\" Lou Paskalis, a marketing executive, said. Companies are also \"very concerned about what Elon's acolytes might do to their brands if they publicly distanced themselves from the platform.\" </p><p>   Mr. Musk recently confronted Apple Inc., claiming it curbed ad spending on Twitter and asked, \"Do they hate free speech in America?\" -- before tweeting two days later that he and the iPhone maker had resolved their issues. Apple hasn't commented. </p><p>   Mr. Musk has said he wants to ensure that Twitter remains open to competing ideas -- even ones that offend -- and has suggested that he welcomes criticism on the platform. </p><p>   \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,\" he tweeted earlier this year, the day Twitter accepted his offer. </p><p>   Twitter's harassment policy currently posted on its site, says it aims to facilitate healthy dialogue. \"We prohibit behavior that harasses or intimidates, or is otherwise intended to shame or degrade others,\" it says, adding that abusive behavior can threaten people's safety and lead to physical and emotional hardship. </p><p>   \"There are clear questions that if the terms of service are violated, who's going to rein him in, who's gonna put the brakes on that?\" said Brianna Wu, a former Democratic congressional candidate and software engineer who received threats during the GamerGate incident almost a decade ago when women coders faced intense harassment online. </p><p>   As soon as Mr. Musk tweeted on Saturday in a way that misrepresented the academic writing of Mr. Roth, Twitter's former head of trust and safety -- suggesting he was in favor of children having access to adult internet services -- people raised concerns for Mr. Roth's safety. </p><p>   In the wake of harassment following Mr. Musk's tweets, Mr. Roth has moved out of his house temporarily because of threats, according to a person familiar with the situation. </p><p>   The sharp turn that Mr. Musk took on Mr. Roth contrasts with how he defended him and praised him in October, when he wrote in a tweet: \"My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.\" </p><p>   But Mr. Musk's tone changed after Mr. Roth left the company and went public with concerns about content moderation under the new regime. </p><p>   At Twitter, Mr. Musk has overseen the release of internal company documents that have included names and emails of workers, subjecting them to the harsh light of public scrutiny. Some observers have suggested the release of the private details violated Twitter's terms of service for  doxing. Mr. Musk has said releasing the unredacted details was a mistake. </p><p>   On Wednesday, the account that used public data to track Mr. Musk's private plane was suspended. Jack Sweeney, a student at the University of Central Florida who ran the account, said he wasn't given a reason for the move. </p><p>   Mr. Musk suggested the account violated Twitter's terms of service. \"Real-time posting of someone else's location violates doxing policy,\" he wrote, adding later that tracking of his location endangered his family. </p><p>   On Thursday, Twitter suspended the accounts of several journalists, some of which had referenced a version of Mr. Sweeney's flight-tracking feature that remained active on some other platforms. </p><p>   The accounts belonged to journalists from publications including CNN, the Washington Post, the New York Times and Mashable. </p><p>   A spokesman for the Times said neither it nor its reporter had received any explanation about why his account was suspended. A spokesperson for CNN said it asked Twitter for an explanation and will re-evaluate its relationship with the platform based on its response. The Post didn't respond to a request for comment. Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, declined in an email to comment on specific user accounts. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Suzanne Vranica, Jeff Horwitz and Elisa Cho contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
