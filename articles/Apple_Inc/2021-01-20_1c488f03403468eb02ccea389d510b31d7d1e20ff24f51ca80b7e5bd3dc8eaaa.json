  "text": "<p>January, four o'clock — darkness was already creeping over the bloodshot sky. I was broke, depressed and anxious about impending adulthood and final-year exams. After Christmas an uneasy fog of quiet had set in, interrupted only by the clank and hiss of the unreliable boiler. I went into the kitchen — the cupboards were bare. Reluctantly, I pulled on my coat and headed out to the supermarket. </p> <p>Cheerless commuters trudging home filled the streets. I was pacing, waiting for the Tube, peering into the dark tunnel looking for the lights, when I caught sight of her — a girl walking perilously close to the edge of the platform. Before I could react, a woman carrying a toddler had bolted over to her. The girl's face was anguished. Are you OK?” the woman with the child asked. “Do you need help?” </p> <p>“I'm fine,” the distraught girl said, then began to weep, her face a crumpled photo of grief. The train pulled in and the mother ushered the girl on to a carriage. She comforted her, speaking to her in a God-infused tone of compassion. </p> <p>I wanted to help but what could I have offered her when I knew nothing of life or love? The mother reached into her shopper and pulled out an orange — a Sicilian blood orange wrapped in purple tissue paper. She unwrapped it and handed it to the girl — the perfume of its rind filled the stale air. </p> <p>The girl held it in her slender palm — a joyful orb that promised a brighter world in its segmented interior. “It's going to be all right, I promise,” I heard the woman coo. </p> <p>I walked out of the Underground into immense beauty. This feeling wouldn't last, my anxiety would return; but right in that moment I loved the downpour gurgling in the drains, the macabre branches of the trees, even the whiff of a spliff in the wind. </p> <p>The world is full of sorrow and disappointments but there are always citrus fruits in the winter — radiant planets in the fruit bowl that offer hope, that illuminate and bring consolation to the human spirit with their transformative scent and taste.</p> <h2>Pan-fried mackerel with Asian citrus salad</h2> <p>Serves 4 </p> <p><strong>For the salad</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Dry the mackerel well and place it on a chopping board, skin-side up. Using a sharp knife, score the skin at 1cm intervals. </p></li>  <li><p>Whisk the palm sugar with the lime juice and fish sauce until dissolved and stir in the chilli and garlic. Taste and balance with more sugar, lime juice or fish sauce if required.</p></li>  <li><p>Toast the coconut in a small dry saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, being careful not to burn it.</p></li>  <li><p>Place the citrus fruits in a large bowl, add the sliced shallot and half of the dressing, and toss to coat.</p></li>  <li><p>Season the mackerel with sea salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the mackerel, skin-side down, and cook for three minutes or until the skin is crisp and golden. Turn the fish over, then remove the pan from the stove and let the fish cook through in the residual heat for one minute.</p></li>  <li><p>Finally, add the herbs, coconut and nuts to the salad and toss again. Divide among plates and top with mackerel and fried shallots. Serve with the remaining dressing on the side or drizzled over the plates.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Ravinder Bhogal is chef-patron of Jikoni in London;&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.jikonilondon.com/\"><em>jikonilondon.com</em></a><em>.
