  "text": "<p>With U.S. Sanctions</p><p>The U.S. and its trans-Atlantic allies imposed financial sanctions on senior Belarus officials and police units the Biden administration said are responsible for escalating political repression, including the forced diversion in May of a commercial airline carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his subsequent arrest.</p><p>The sanctions mark a significant expansion of pressure by the Biden administration as it coordinates joint action with the European Union and other Western governments against the political crackdown by Alexander Lukashenko, the former Soviet state's leader. \"We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime's continuing attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law,\" the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and Canada said in a joint statement accompanying the sanctions on Monday.</p><p>The Belarus Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request to comment. Mr. Lukashenko and his officials have rejected the criticism and called the collective actions a campaign of hybrid warfare against his administration.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department sanctions are against 16 individuals, including senior Lukashenko administration officials, the head of the country's National Assembly and observers who certified presidential elections last year that most Western nations have deemed fraudulent. The move follows State Department actions barring dozens of Belarusian officials from entering the U.S.</p><p>-- Ian Talley</p><p>---</p><p>JORDAN</p><p>Trial Concerning</p><p>A Royal Spat Begins</p><p>A public rift between Jordan's King Abdullah II and his younger half brother entered a new stage, as two of the prince's alleged co-conspirators appeared in court for the first time to face charges of sedition concerning their involvement in a purported plot to replace the monarch.</p><p>In a remarkable scene on Monday at the state security court in Amman that was closed to the public, former royal court chief Bassem Awadallah and minor royal Sharif Hassan bin Zaid appeared handcuffed and wearing blue prison uniforms, according to their lawyers. Authorities say both were working on behalf of Prince Hamzah bin Hussein.</p><p>Mr. Awadallah, who developed ties to Saudi Arabia after leaving the Jordanian government over a decade ago, and Sharif Hassan face charges of sedition and incitement to oppose the political system, according to the indictment that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. They could face 20 years in prison if convicted.</p><p>Both entered not guilty pleas, their lawyers said.</p><p>Prince Hamzah, whom King Abdullah removed as crown prince in 2004, has denied wrongdoing and isn't on trial.</p><p>-- Stephen Kalin</p><p>---</p><p>HONG KONG</p><p>Dissident Newspaper</p><p>Considers Closing</p><p>The publisher of the popular pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper said it might cease publishing after authorities froze its assets and charged senior executives including its top editor under the national security law.</p><p>Its closure would herald the biggest blow to press freedom in the city since Beijing imposed a national security law in June 2020 to crush dissent in the Chinese territory. Apple Daily and its jailed founder, Jimmy Lai, have been frequent targets for the city's authorities.</p><p>Board members of Next Digital Ltd., the newspaper's publisher, met Monday and set a Friday deadline to decide whether to close, Apple Daily reported. The board voted to request that the government release portions of its assets so it could pay employees.</p><p>Apple Daily, which marked its 26th anniversary Sunday, has faced a precarious future since police in May froze Mr. Lai's assets, including his majority stake in Next Digital. On Thursday, the city's security chief warned people to distance themselves from the arrested Apple Daily executives, saying they used news as a tool to challenge China's national security.</p><p>-- Elaine Yu</p><p>---</p><p>SPAIN</p><p>Nine Separatists</p><p>To Receive Pardons</p><p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the Spanish cabinet would approve pardons Tuesday for nine separatist Catalan politicians and activists imprisoned for their roles in the 2017 push to break away from Spain.</p><p>Twelve separatist leaders were convicted of sedition and other crimes, and nine of them were given long prison terms after they held a banned secession referendum and declared independence based on its results. Most unionists boycotted the vote, which took place amid a police crackdown.</p><p>Oriol Junqueras, the former regional vice president and the highest-ranking imprisoned separatist, said over the weekend that the pardons \"show the weakness of the state's apparatus,\" and suggested that their timing was because the government fears that higher European courts will overturn the separatists' convictions in Spain.</p><p>Thousands opposed to the move have called for Mr. Sanchez's resignation.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>---</p><p>ARMENIA</p><p>Leader's Party Wins</p><p>Parliamentary Vote</p><p>Results released Monday showed that the party of Armenia's acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan won snap parliamentary elections that he called to ease anger over a peace deal he signed with Azerbaijan.</p><p>With all precincts counted, Mr. Pashinyan's Civil Contract party won 53.9% of the vote. A bloc led by former President Robert Kocharyan was second with about 21%, the election commission said.</p><p>Mr. Pashinyan called the early election after months of protests demanding his resignation because of the peace pact he signed to end six weeks of fighting with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
