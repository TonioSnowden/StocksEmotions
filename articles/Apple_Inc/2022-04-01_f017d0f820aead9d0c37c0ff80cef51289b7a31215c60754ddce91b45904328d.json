  "text": "<p>“How will you be coming?” asks Dervla Murphy when I ring to arrange our lunch. I joke that I really ought to say “on my bike” — after all, it was Murphy's solo cycle ride to India in 1963 that launched the Irish travel writer's career as a chronicler of far-off lands. But the truth is that I will be driving to her home in the picturesque town of Lismore, south-east Ireland, where, at the age of 90, Murphy is proposing to cook me soup. I am instructed by her publisher to bring along some “really good cheddar”. And beer — Murphy specifies Old Speckled Hen.</p> <p>The journey down from Dublin is rain-soaked, and fog blurs the views as I cross the hills coming into a town dominated by an imposing castle. I spot the metal gates to Murphy's home, a former 17th-century cattle market, just down from an old-fashioned store that has antique bottles on display and looks as if it might not have changed since Murphy was a girl. The padlock on a thick chain is not locked. I navigate the warren of stone buildings and cobbled yards calling out “hello” until finally a voice answers from a doorway behind me.</p> <p>Tall, with no-nonsense short grey hair, the top of her back painfully humped from rheumatoid arthritis, a tooth missing and wearing a darned jumper, Murphy invites me into her study. She shuts the door, steps out of her navy plastic clogs and, as if she had been waiting thirstily for my arrival, points to three cans laid out on a table: Guinness, Weissbier and cider. Her voice deep and strong, she briskly dismisses my reply that I have to drive with, “Well, you can have one then”, takes the beer after I pick the cider then settles back into a comfortable armchair, nursing her drink and smiling.</p> <p>Murphy's travels took her to Nepal, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Gaza, Israel, Peru and Cuba, among other places, by bicycle, on foot or occasionally on a mule. “This dependence on motor transport I find very disquieting when adventure and enjoyment are the objects of the exercise and time-saving is not a consideration,” she wrote in <em>Wheels Within Wheels </em>(1979), her memoir of her youth before her travels. </p> <p>But the world for her has now shrunk to the confines of this, her book-filled but otherwise spartan home of the past 40 years. “I'm lucky to still be enjoying being alive . . . looking at the sky and seeing leaves moving in the wind,” she says, with no trace of bitterness at finding her once active life now so seriously restricted.</p> <p>That is no doubt helped by what she calls “my addiction to solitude” — a phrase that sounds like it should come from a social misfit, not a curious observer, astute questioner and sympathetic listener who has spent large chunks of her life seeking out and exploring other places, as documented in 26 books. The wood stove gives a warm glow but with the standard lamp behind her chair unlit, her study is in almost total darkness even though it is only approaching 1pm, as if to reinforce an image of a place cut off from the modern world and Murphy herself a relic of a bygone age.</p> <p>For her part, Murphy claims to have no time to dwell on the past because she finds so much in current events to worry about, following the news on the BBC World Service radio and Al Jazeera on her computer because she has no desire for — indeed, has never owned — a television. She revels in her trenchant views and, while she admits she has become more politicised as she has grown older, she says she was always radical. “Oh, I was born that way,” she laughs.</p> <p>We are meeting before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which she thought was a bluff that would not actually come to pass. A month into the war, I call and speak to her again: she is horrified by the conflict, but also scathing about western countries that talk about democracy while being involved in the arms trade. “There are fortunes to be made on this war by the weapons industries and its allies,” she says.</p> <p>But her wider beef with the modern world is its “gross, gross materialism . . . capitalism has taken over”. She laments: “Socialism now is regarded as a dirty word. Even to say socialism seems to identify in a lot of minds as a sort of Stalinist attitude . . . when it is, in fact, the only answer for the majority of human beings — to spread the earth's resources and talents fairly.”</p>  <p><strong>Ireland has changed beyond recognition</strong>, both socially and economically, from the poor, rural, Church-dominated state of Murphy's childhood, when she recalls some of her classmates going to school barefoot. But she hated the Celtic Tiger era, starting in the mid-1990s, which transformed modern Ireland's skyline and fortunes. “Yuck,” she spits. “Horrible little creature.”</p> <p>In the end, the boom turned to bust in just over a decade and Ireland, despite strong economic growth again, is now beset by a severe housing crisis. Murphy, predictably, is at one remove. “I've never been able to worry about money — not that I ever had any, but I couldn't ever feel it as a source of worry,” she says. “As long as you had just enough to survive, that's all anybody needs.”</p> <p>My stomach is by now rather in need of some food but Murphy appears so settled in her armchair that I wonder if I will be having any lunch at all. It turns out that we are waiting for one of her three granddaughters to arrive, although in the end, after several telephone calls, Murphy learns that a fierce storm will delay her for hours. So we head over to another stone building, into a tiny old-fashioned kitchen with no mod cons that leads into a sunny dining room with shelves of books — Murphy inherited her love of reading from her father, a librarian — lining the original stone wall. Her ageing dog trots in; two cats slide in and out.</p> <p>I set down the selection of cheeses I have brought, some sourdough bread and the Old Speckled Hen. She stirs a saucepan of soup and puts out a loaf. Though she laments that she can no longer swim, cycle or even walk very far, and is currently suffering crippling insomnia, she bustles about, sending me to sit down at a table laid for two. Her hospitality and decency seem to mirror that of all those who have looked after Murphy on her many travels. She carries in a single steaming bowl of soup and settles on a couch. She never eats lunch, she explains, though soon goes to fetch another beer.</p> <p>She is welcoming but not motherly, still less grandmotherly. As I tuck into the homemade lentil, carrot and potato soup — not fancy, but delicious — she turns the conversation to what she calls the “gender culture war”. “Why can it not be accepted that in the sort of arc of the sexes, as it were, there are people like me? . . . I mean I was always mistaken for a man, because of my voice and I suppose the way I behaved,” she says. “I'm male-ish . . . there are variations on male and female.”</p> <p>Aged 20, she was briefly abducted in Paris — an experience that made her aware of her reluctance ever to call out for help. But Murphy is exuberantly dauntless; she has often observed that there is no need for courage if you don't feel afraid — a sentiment that served her well in Northern Ireland, which she visited in one of the worst years of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a54c3f33-7924-4ad9-b82a-2d91f6584948\">Troubles</a>. Her travels were born of curiosity, and sometimes a sense of duty — for example, a stint volunteering at a Tibetan refugee camp in the Himalayas and a trip to Israel in 2008, after years of being “lazy and hazy . . . about the Palestinian problem”.</p>  <p><strong>Born in 1931, less than a decade</strong> after the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922 and with the 1919-21 Irish war of independence and the 1922-23 civil war still a vivid memory, she recalls lingering “postcolonial attitudes” as she was growing up in a country that was “backwards in so many ways”. </p> <p>Her dreams of travelling were sparked when she was given a bicycle and an atlas for her 10th birthday, but they were frustrated while she nursed her invalid mother; she did not set out for India until she was 31 — a trip she documented in <em>Full Tilt</em> (1965). By then, she was free of commitments — both parents were dead, leaving her a home she could rent out. Fitting in — still less conforming with other people's values or a powerful Church with which she had been disillusioned since her late teens — did not cross her mind. “I just did my own thing.”</p> <p>That didn't only mean travelling across four continents and describing honestly what she saw. It also included being a single mother in 1968, at a time when unmarried women were still being institutionalised in Ireland's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/633e0221-3644-45e1-b872-4ca19b56d618\">infamous mother and baby homes</a>. But Murphy laughs at the notion that she was judged, recalling instead how neighbours brought “all sorts of knitted items” for her newborn daughter, Rachel. Her baby's father was married to someone else, but what really scandalised the locals, she says, was the fact that she took her baby out naked in her pram to get some sunlight.</p> <p>After staying at home for a few years, Murphy took Rachel to Coorg (also known as Kodagu) in India — a four-month trip during which her daughter celebrated her fifth birthday — and later on other travels, revelling in how “wonderfully adaptable” her little travelling companion proved to be. When I tell her I quit my job and moved from Peru to Argentina with no employment to go to, as a single mother of a three-year-old son, she exclaims: “Oh lovely! That's the way to do it!”</p> <p>Her own career unfolded with no planned path. Despite her passion for discovery and current affairs, she would have hated to be tied down as a foreign correspondent or yoked to a publisher, she says. Each book — painstakingly written out in longhand by the window in her study before being typed up — financed the next journey. </p> <p>Her desk remains strewn with papers, the bookshelf next to it lined with references for a book about Jordan, begun after a trip there in her early eighties. She has written only a third of it and is resigned to never finishing it because of her rheumatoid arthritis. Coorg is one of the places she would return to if she could “because I'm told it's less affected than other parts of India by modernisation”. But she has little time for regret, allowing only that she wished now she had tried to get into Tibet instead of just working with refugees.</p> <p>Incredibly, for a woman who journeyed thousands of miles to see and experience things for herself, she claims that “I'm not a very visual person. I'm more a print person, and a picture person.” Perhaps that is why she hates the idea of returning to some of her best-loved destinations. “It's extraordinary to look back and to think of Afghanistan, in particular, which I do so often,” she says. “[But] even if I could, I wouldn't want to revisit it now. I have such wonderful memories . . . </p> <p>“What really infuriates me is the way people keep on describing it as one of the poorest countries in the world. Utterly untrue! I mean, when I was there, admittedly 60 years ago almost, it was the reverse. I was really shocked when I crossed the Khyber Pass and came down into real poverty in Pakistan and India. I mean, it was undeveloped and this is a great confusion. Now, I think, people imagine undeveloped means poor. If it had been left alone to do its own thing . . . ” she laments, her voice trailing off. In any case, her style of travelling is no longer possible. “Politically, the world has changed too much,” she says.</p>  <p><strong>A second bowl of soup</strong> is insisted upon; I gladly accept. Apples stewed into a sweet caramelised purée follow. Now we are on to leaders and politicians. She calls Brexit “such a calamity”. Of Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, she says: “I don't think anyone could do or say the stupid things he does unless there was something seriously wrong between the ears.” US president Joe Biden “like myself, is losing it” and she fears “a Trump clone” may follow. </p> <p>But for the British monarch, just a few years her senior, there is sympathy from this “ordinary Irish republican” who wants to see a united Ireland eventually but just hopes the politicians don't rush it and mess it up. “The poor old Queen, I feel sorry for her,” Murphy says — both because of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37a818c-92ac-43c1-9fe7-ecef1e198aa9\">current tribulations</a> and because of a life characterised by “never any choice — the exact opposite of what I regard of as the good life”. The royal family is “a barbaric system”, she says. “I think it probably won't last that much longer.”</p> <p>The experiences of her own life may have been extraordinary, but she is convinced that she herself is not. “I've never done anything that any ordinary person couldn't do. I've done nothing extreme, you might say . . . I never did anything very daring.” She has admitted to using a gun to shoot at wolves and claims to have paid a bribe only once, but now she battles with what she calls “good days and bad days”. </p> <p>She is sanguine about reaching the end of a long life, professing no fear of dying. She chuckles frequently and exudes contentment even as her adventures these days are the rants she enjoys with friends and the intellectual journeys she goes on from the comfort of her armchair. “There are so many books to be read. The problem is, at 90, there isn't enough time to read them all,” she laughs.</p> <p>I am conscious that she is exhausted and prepare to leave. She settles back into her armchair, wondering if her lunchtime beers will help her nap, and urges me to visit again. Fittingly, for such a self-sufficient woman whose world expanded for decades but now fits entirely inside her own walls, she asks me to lock the gate on the way out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/jude-webber\"><em>Jude Webber</em></a><em> is the FT's Ireland correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Jude Webber 2022 'Travel writer Dervla Murphy: ‘I just did my own thing'' FT.com 1 April.
