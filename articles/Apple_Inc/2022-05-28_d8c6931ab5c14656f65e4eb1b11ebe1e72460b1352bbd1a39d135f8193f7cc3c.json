  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: China Smartphone Sales Drop",
  "text": "<p>In April, Apple warned that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China threatens to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion this quarter. This month, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. said its January-March smartphone revenue declined 11% from the year-earlier period and partly blamed closed stores and component shortages that stemmed from the country's rigid Covid-control policies.</p><p>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's biggest contract semiconductor maker and a producer of smartphone chips, said this month that it now expects global smartphone makers to produce at least 200 million fewer units of smartphones in 2022 compared with industry forecasts. Most of those cuts come from Chinese phone makers, said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-chief executive.</p><p>\"There is no end in sight to the downtrends,\" Mr. Zhao said in an earnings call.</p><p>The decline in smartphone demand is among the factors driving the deceleration in the world's second-biggest economy and inflicting pain on global electronics makers.</p><p>The impact of Covid-19 restrictions -- including lockdowns at industrial hubs -- has rippled through the economy, disrupting supply chains as well as damping consumption.</p>",
