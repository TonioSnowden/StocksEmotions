  "text": "<p>As with every love story, you remember the beginning. Ours started more than 10 years ago, in a dimly lit diner near Marunouchi station in Tokyo. We had wandered in, not sure what was on offer. There was no menu in English but with the pictures and some tableside pantomime we managed to order something. </p> <p>First came beer, a promising start, then our food — lacquered trays with twirls of glistening noodles and cups of broth, one portion with BBQ duck and one with eel. </p> <p>The waiter showed us what to do — mix grated daikon into the broth, add wasabi and chopped spring onion to taste, dip in a few strands of noodles and inhale. Miming, he explained that we were meant to slurp noisily, splashing the sauce around as we sucked the noodles down — he pointed to the sauce-splattered wall nearby to exhibit the desired result. </p> <p>We'd had soba (buckwheat) noodles before but not like this, nothing remotely as fun, exciting and delicious. By the end, we were head over heels in love. Our waiter returned with a pot of hot water — the same water the noodles had been cooked in — which somehow promised health and happiness. He filled our cups, encouraged us to swirl and drink — and we knew this would be more than just a fling. </p> <p>After that, we had soba everywhere and in any way we could — in fancy hotels, roadside canteens, in the back streets of Kyoto and the mountains of Takayama. We went back to London with a suitcase full of noodles and a new passion. </p> <p>Our steamy affair has since morphed into a more comfortable, loving, domestic relationship. We know that when we get home at the end of a busy day there will always be a pack of noodles waiting for us, ready in minutes for a quick one on the sofa (we buy bottled sauce). But every so often we take our soba out for a fancy dinner — best plates and candles, expensive sake, pink duck breasts in a sweet-salty marinade, citrus and silky ribbons of cucumber — to celebrate an old flame that still burns brightly.</p> <h2>Duck with winter citrus and soba noodles</h2> <p><strong>For the duck marinade</strong></p> <p><strong>For the salad</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Start by marinating the duck. Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the breast in a criss-cross pattern, without cutting the flesh. Mix the marinade ingredients together and place the scored duck into the mixture for a couple of hours, flipping it every 30 minutes.</p></li>  <li><p>While you wait for the duck, segment the fruit over a bowl, retaining all the juice. Halve the chilli, remove the seeds and slice thinly. Create ribbons of cucumber with a peeler and chop the chives.</p></li>  <li><p>Drain any juice from the citrus into a small bowl and add the rice wine vinegar.</p></li>  <li><p>Cook the soba according to the instructions on the packet. Chill under running water, transfer to a bowl and dress with the sesame oil. Mix to coat and keep at room temperature.</p></li>  <li><p>To cook the duck, set a heavy-based frying pan on a medium heat. Lift the duck out of the marinade, shaking as much as possible back into the bowl. Lay the duck breast on a sheet of kitchen paper and pat dry. Put it in the frying pan, skin-side down. Add the citrus juices and vinegar mix to the remaining marinade. Let the fat on the duck render slowly into the pan for three or four minutes — it should go a dark golden brown. Flip the breast so that the skin is facing up and fry for a further two minutes. Add all the marinade ingredients to the pan around the breast. Bring to a boil, cook for four minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside for another four minutes. Remove the breast from the liquid on to a chopping board. Add all the cooking liquid to the soba noodles and mix to coat. </p></li>  <li><p>Add the cucumber ribbons, chives, chilli and citrus segments, toss together and divide into four plates.</p></li>  <li><p>Thinly slice the duck breasts and serve.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Email Sarit and Itamar at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=honeyandco@ft.com\"><em>honeyandco@ft.com</em></a><em>&#xa0;and follow them on Instagram&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/honeyandco/?hl=en\"><em>@Honeyandco</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
