  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Fired Executive Says Apple Overreacted to His Quip",
  "text": "<p>The video, posted online in early September, showed Mr. Blevins getting out of his Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren at a car show and being asked what he does for a living. He responded: \"I race cars, play golf and fondle big-breasted women. But I take weekends and major holidays off.\"</p><p>The comment, Mr. Blevins said, was a reference to the 1981 comedy \"Arthur,\" in which a bawdy Dudley Moore makes a similar remark in response to a question about what he does for a living. Mr. Blevins, whose negotiating skills as a top Apple executive helped the tech giant build and maintain its formidable supply chain, was with his wife, who was laughing in the TikTok video as the two arrived at the car show together.</p><p>In the early-morning phone call, an Apple executive told him that he had to get the video removed immediately.</p><p>\"'This is really bad, some people have complained,'\" Mr. Blevins said he remembered the Apple executive saying.</p><p>Apple declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Blevins, 55 years old, said he stayed up all night trying to contact the TikToker, who goes by the online name Daniel Mac and questions people driving luxury cars about what they do for a living. Mr. Blevins said he made several pleas to the social-media influencer but received no response.</p><p>Mr. Blevins said he was asked to resign and he declined. Days after the video surfaced Sept. 5, he was fired.</p><p>\"It was 22 years dissolved in about 25 seconds,\" said Mr. Blevins. He added: \"It utterly shocked me. My whole life has been Apple. I tried to be the most loyal person.\"</p><p>His departure, details of which haven't been previously reported, leaves Apple with a big hole to fill during a critical time for the company. Apple is dealing with disruptions in its supply chain, which are overwhelmingly concentrated in China. Mr. Blevins, who was a vice president of procurement, and his team of employees were responsible for negotiating with the web of suppliers that make components for Apple's products and assemble them. His negotiating abilities earned him the nickname \"the Blevinator.\"</p><p>Following his firing, Mr. Blevins wasn't replaced, and instead his group was reorganized throughout Apple's operations unit, Mr. Blevins said.</p><p>The firing has left him in disbelief that something he intended as a joke, uttered to a non-Apple employee while he wasn't working, could erase a lifetime of dedication for a company he loved and believed in, Mr. Blevins said. He said he is sorry to those he offended with the comment, but he sees his firing as a blunder by Apple and a capitulation to broader cultural pressure.</p><p>Some of his former employees support him and say that while he sometimes would use humor to deflate tense situations, they hadn't witnessed any other sexist comments or unprofessional behavior.</p><p>Others who worked for Apple say they think his firing was necessary because the company shouldn't tolerate sexist comments or behavior among managers.</p><p>Mr. Blevins, who grew up in the rural South, was always a somewhat unusual fit in the Cupertino, Calif., corridors of America's most valuable company, but he was embraced by Apple's leadership because of his prowess as a negotiator, according to Mr. Blevins and former Apple employees. Starting in 2014, he was allowed to work out of his West Palm Beach, Fla., house.</p><p>In his two decades at the company, Mr. Blevins had emerged as one of an essential cadre of executives who helped build Apple into a colossus through deals with suppliers of chips, displays and other parts that were mostly assembled in Asia. With brazen tactics -- such as once putting two companies competing for the same deal in neighboring rooms in a hotel while he went back and forth between them -- Mr. Blevins helped Apple keep costs down and the supply of its iPhones and other gadgets secure.</p><p>After his firing, company executives were still planning a going-away party for him with invitations extended to more than 100 people, but the party was canceled when communication began breaking down between Mr. Blevins and Apple, said Mr. Blevins. He also said he didn't like the idea of Apple throwing him a party after having just fired him, calling it a \"hypocritical\" action. He said he didn't receive severance.</p><p>Under Chief Executive Tim Cook, Apple has promoted its efforts to create an inclusive workplace where employees are respected, and it has said it doesn't tolerate discriminatory or demeaning behavior.</p><p>There is a broad continuum in which a wide range of behavior including crude jokes can now be firable offenses for any corporate executives and public figures, said Davia Temin, chief executive of Temin &amp; Co., a crisis-management and marketing firm.</p><p>The abruptness with which he was fired has left Mr. Blevins angry, he said. \"They humiliated me and damaged my reputation.\"</p>",
