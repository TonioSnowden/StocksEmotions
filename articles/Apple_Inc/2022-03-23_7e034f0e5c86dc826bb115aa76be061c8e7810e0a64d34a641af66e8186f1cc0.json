  "text": "<p>(Netflix)</p><p>The new season of Netflix's \"Bridgerton\" brings more fun for young, high-society singles in 19th century Regency-era England. Meanwhile, their parents and handlers fixate on the pairings and what merging with another family can do for their own.</p><p>Once again, the anonymous scribe known as Lady Whistledown is back to make the secret gossip public, much to the pleasure and pain of those involved. The end of last season revealed (to viewers) that Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan), who is close to the titular Bridgerton family, is the pen behind the gossip. This season, viewers get to witness how she reports and creates her newsletter. But Penelope isn't taking over as the voice of Lady Whistledown. Julie Andrews, who provided the voice of the then-unknown narrator through the first season, returns for more.</p><p>\"You don't just get rid of Julie Andrews,\" creator Chris Van Dusen says. \"In her head, [Penelope] hears Julie Andrews's voice, just like the audience hears Julie Andrews's voice.\"</p><p>The first season of the Shonda Rhimes-produced show based on a series of romance novelsby Julia Quinn was a massive hit for Netflix. The streamer said that in its first four weeks, 82 million households caught at least a couple of minutes of what Mr. Van Dusen calls a \"marriage of fantasy and history\" that reimagines the British upper crust as racially dynamic and overseen by a woman of color, Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel). Then there were those steamy bedroom (and ladder) scenes, which Mr. Van Dusen says also served his goal of merging fantasy and history.</p><p>\"I wanted the experience of watching the show to not be so different from the experience of reading one of those romance novels in terms of it feeling like a wild ride at times,\" he says. \"And in terms of leaving people a little hot and bothered and breathless.\"</p><p>Season Two of \"Bridgerton\" begins streaming Friday on Netflix.</p><p>'Pachinko'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Pachinko,\" an intimate, eight-episode epic, travels from Japanese-occupied Korea in 1915 to New York, Tokyo and Osaka in 1989 to tell the story of four generations of a Korean family. The show's central character, Sunja, is seen growing up as a young girl at her family's boardinghouse in Korea, as an expecting teenage mother and a grandmother and longtime resident of Japan, during which she is depicted by Yuh-Jung Youn, best known in the U.S. for her Oscar-winning work in \"Minari.\"</p><p>\"Pachinko,\" told in Korean, Japanese and English, was adapted by creator Soo Hugh from Min Jin Lee's novel of the same name. Rather than unfold strictly chronologically, the different periods of Sunja's life are interwoven with those of her family members—including a son in Osaka who runs a Pachinko parlor (a kind of gambling hall) and a grandson in New York who works in finance and hopes his family history helps close a deal in Tokyo. Executive producer Michael Ellenberg says this approach helped realize a key part of Ms. Hugh's vision for the series: to collapse the distance between past and present and create a dialogue between the generations.</p><p>\"The past isn't the past in this,\" he says, \"it's the present.\"</p><p>Theresa Kang-Lowe, another executive producer on the series, says that is one of the universal themes she saw when she was introduced to the story.</p><p>\"If you look back,\" she says, \"whether it's your mother or your grandmother or your aunt, there's a woman in everybody's family history that has had to make certain choices that then impacted the rest of her lineage.\"</p><p>\"Pachinko\" begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>'Our Flag Means Death'</p><p>(HBO Max)</p><p>\"Our Flag Means Death\" is a comedy starring Rhys Darby as Stede Bonnet, a \"gentleman pirate\" in the 1700s who left his life of leisure for a life of infinite high-jinks on the high seas. Taika Waititi co-stars as Blackbeard.</p><p>Things get weird quickly on this show. In the course of just a few minutes in the second episode, Bonnet undergoes a psychotherapy session from a member of a tribe holding him and his crew hostage; the ghost of a British naval officer waltzes around with a sword through his eye; and Bonnet struggles with the memory of the bullying he endured in his youth at the hands of this now-impaled ghost.</p><p>Though the series—very loosely based on the life of a pirate of the same name—is full of physical and absurdist comedy, it is also got a serious streak. It is, after all, the story of a man who left his old life—and those in it—to pursue a new one.</p><p>\"I don't necessarily always wanna watch 'Breaking Bad' or 'Ozark'—which I love. Both of those shows are great,\" creator David Jenkins says. \"But sometimes I want to feel things and watch something that's a half-hour and funny and still go to that place where you're, like: oh, he destroyed his family.\"</p><p>The final two episodes of the first season of \"Our Flag Means Death\" begin streaming Thursday on HBO Max.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>—Funny Serious: Mr. Jenkins says that the comedy that is also a drama—more or less the inverse of the dramedy—is having a moment. Two great examples, he says, are \"Only Murders In the Building\" (Hulu), about a trio of podcasting sleuths (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, Martin Short); and \"Hacks\" (HBO Max) starring Jean Smart as a Las Vegas comedian at a transition point in her life and career. \"I get bored when I see a comedy and it's: joke, joke, joke, joke, and then it resets every episode,\" he says. \"I want to see things build up and stick on the character.\"</p><p>—\"Yellowstone\" Rides Free: \"Yellowstone,\" the Paramount Network series that is one of the biggest things on cable and has inspired the Paramount+ spinoff, \"1883,\" has long been available to stream on-demand on Peacock. Pluto TV, a free, ad-supported streaming service, is showing each of the first three seasons in their entirety this weekend on its More TV Drama channel. Season One begins streaming at 3 p.m. ET on Friday, Season Two streams at 3 p.m. Saturday and Season Three streams at noon on Sunday.</p><p>What to Watch: 'Bridgerton' Season 2 on Netflix and Five More Shows to Stream This Week</p>",
