  "title": "Twitter, Starbucks, Walmart: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose shares moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Twitter Inc.</p><p>Elon Musk is ruffling feathers at Twitter. The CEO of Tesla Inc. will join the social-media platform's board after Mr. Musk revealed his 9.2% stake in the company on Monday. Twitter also said on Wednesday it is working on adding an edit button—a function long-requested by many users—after Mr. Musk polled his Twitter followers on the feature. Twitter shares gained 27% Monday.</p><p>Starbucks Corp.</p><p>Howard Schultz created buzz on his first day back at Starbucks. On Monday, the interim CEO suspended billions of dollars in share repurchases and said his immediate focus would be on the coffee chain's cafes, customers and employees, rather than the stock market. Starbucks recently struggled with staffing some locations and faces the most serious unionization push among its U.S. baristas in the chain's history. Mr. Schultz said Starbucks must grow faster and redesign its store experience to be more relevant to consumers, even if that means sacrificing quarterly earnings and shareholder returns in the short term. Starbucks shares fell 3.7% Monday.</p><p>JetBlue Airways Corp.</p><p>Another discount airline is swooping down on Spirit Airlines Inc. JetBlue offered to buy the ultralow-cost carrier for roughly $3.6 billion, Spirit said Tuesday, challenging rival Frontier Group Holdings Inc. Spirit already struck a $2.9 billion cash-and-stock merger agreement with Frontier that was announced in February, a deal that would transform the two discounters into the fifth-largest U.S. airline. Spirit said late Thursday that it would entertain its new suitor's unsolicited bid but that its agreement with Frontier remains in place and its board continues to recommend it. Spirit shares soared 22% Tuesday.</p><p>Shell PLC</p><p>Shell expects a stain from its Russia exit. The London-based oil giant on Thursday said it anticipates accounting charges from $4 billion to $5 billion in its first quarter related to its decision to exit its Russia operations amid the country's war on Ukraine. The disclosure gives investors more clues about the effects Western companies face as they divorce themselves from Russia. Beyond the impact of the Russia exit, Shell said it expects to report strong first-quarter earnings in its large liquefied-natural-gas business, as well as from oil-and-gas trading. Shell shares added 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>Conagra Brands Inc.</p><p>Inflation is still eating up the maker of Slim Jims. Rising costs of ingredients and trucking are leading Conagra to raise its products' prices again, as the food industry confronts higher supply-chain costs driven by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The food manufacturer now expects inflation in the current quarter to be \"an unprecedented 26%\" higher than two years earlier, Chief Executive Sean Connolly said. Conagra's profit took a hit in the quarter that ended Feb. 27, as its costs soared more than expected, and it lowered its adjusted earnings expectations for the fiscal year ending in May. But Mr. Connolly said shoppers are still undeterred as demand remains strong. Conagra shares rose 0.3% Thursday.</p><p>HP Inc.</p><p>Warren Buffett, once wary of technology companies, is doubling down on computer hardware. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in securities filings Wednesday that it has built a stake of more than 11% in computer-and-printer maker HP. The holding—worth more than $4.2 billion, based on HP's Wednesday closing price—marks another foray into computing by the billionaire investor, who has also taken big positions in International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Inc. in recent years. The Omaha, Neb., conglomerate also agreed this year to buy the insurer Alleghany Corp. for about $11.6 billion and boosted its position in Occidental Petroleum Corp. to nearly 15%. HP shares surged 15% Thursday.</p><p>Walmart Inc.</p><p>Walmart is paying up to keep on trucking. The retail giant is offering truck drivers up-to-$110,000 starting salaries and expanding a training program that enables its employees to enter the field to grow its in-house fleet. The push comes as the trucking industry faces challenges in recruitment even as wages rose steadily throughout the pandemic. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target Corp. are taking on more responsibilities within their supply chains and, in some cases, taking over tasks once handled by third parties. Walmart shares gained 0.6% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter, Starbucks, Walmart: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
