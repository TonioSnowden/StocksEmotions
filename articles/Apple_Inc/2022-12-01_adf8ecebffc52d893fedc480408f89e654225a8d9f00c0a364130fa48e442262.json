That bear market will last a total of 18 months, not far off the 17-month bear market seen in the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>But don't rev up the shopping carts just yet. \"Based on current valuation levels for the stock market that are near the 2000 Tech Bubble and 1929 peaks, the S&amp;P 500 is likely to be at least 25% lower in 10 to 12 years,\" he predicts.</p><p>His advice? Sell \"risk on\" assets like stocks, commodities (including energy stocks, which will drop along with oil as a recession kicks in) and cryptocurrencies — highly correlated with tech stocks. Treasury bonds will be riskier than normal during a recession owing to high inflation, he adds.</p><p>\"For those who are risk-averse and want to wait this bear market out until the next bull market starts, you can buy safe and relatively high yielding Treasury bills and floating rate notes,\" said Wolfenbarger, who suggests ETFs, such as the SPDR Bloomberg 3-12 Month T-bill ETF BILS and the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund ETF USFR.</p><p>For aggressive investors looking to profit more significantly from a bear market, he suggests inverse ETFs that rise when stocks fall, such as ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF SH and ProShares Short QQQ PSQ. Those who want to be even more aggressive, can buy double inverse ETFs such as ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P 500 SDS and ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF QID.</p><p>An investor looking to profit from falling oil prices could buy double inverse oil ETF ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil SCO.</p><p>\"After the Fed starts cutting rates and the recession becomes well-entrenched, we will look for stocks to become very oversold (we focus on key technical indicators for this such as Weekly &amp; Monthly RSI and Bollinger Bands) to take profits from this bear market and then position for the next bull market with individual stocks and long and levered-long ETFs,\" he says.</p><p>Read: One of Wall Street's biggest bulls now sees stocks falling early next year as Fed 'overtightens'</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stocks DJIA SPX COMP are flat to slightly lower post data.
