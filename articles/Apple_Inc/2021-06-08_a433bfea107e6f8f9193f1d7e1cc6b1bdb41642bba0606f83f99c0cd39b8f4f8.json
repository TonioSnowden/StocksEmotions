Now he is trying again. Ackman's special purpose acquisition company, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, which raised $4bn last year, was not just the largest blank-cheque vehicle ever launched. It did away with some of the perks for founders, such as free shares, which have given the Spac phenomenon a bad name in some quarters.</p> <p><strong>How clean energy is driving a commodities supercycle </strong>As governments launch huge stimulus programmes focused on job creation and environmental stability, the coming together of such demand and potential supply shortages has many on Wall Street and in the City of London hailing the arrival of a commodities supercycle, and asking: <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/40907aa6-354e-42f8-8d51-8cc01f0e9687\">is copper set to become the new oil</a>? </p> <p><strong>Brexit: can Northern Ireland sticking points be resolved? </strong>Britain and the EU have become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/465e2fc5-4a4e-4be4-bbb7-5e5b4dad5442\">locked in a row</a> over trade rules ahead of crunch talks this week and Joe Biden's arrival in the UK for the G7 summit.
