  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA slumped 158 points, or 0.5%, to 32,022</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was off 25 points, or 0.6%, at 3,997.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped 133 points, or 1.1%, to 11,899.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 436 points, or 1.37%, to 32198, the S&amp;P 500 increased 103 points, or 2.62%, to 4024, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 470 points, or 4.06%, to 12032. For the Nasdaq, it was the best one-day percentage gain since April 6, 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks traded lower after data on second-quarter GDP showed the U.S. economy contracted by 0.9% between the beginning of April and end of June, following a 1.6% contraction during the first quarter.</p><p>See: U.S. economy shrinks in the second quarter, GDP shows, and invites talk of recession</p><p>After initially rallying on the news, stocks eventually slumped after the open. Some economists and market strategists argued that the data wasn't bad enough to pressure the Federal Reserve to rethink its rate-hike plans.</p><p>U.S. economists at Capital Economics argued that the GDP number actually wasn't as bad as it seemed on the surface, as the contraction was driven once again by high inventories, as American companies continue to struggle with large stockpiles of goods acquired during the period when the economy was still struggling with the aftereffects of the COVID lockdown.</p><p>\"The 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn't mean the economy is in recession. The decline was partly due to a huge drag from inventories, while most other coincident indicators, particularly employment, show continued expansion,\" wrote Andrew Hunter, the senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>It's also possible that investors could be reconsidering their initial interpretation of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments from Wednesday's press conference.</p><p>\"Yesterday was an overreaction and a misreading of what Jerome Powell was trying to communicate. The lack of forward guidance doesn't mean we're nearing a pivot, it just means that there is more uncertainty ahead,\" said Mohannad Aama, a portfolio manager at Beam Capital</p><p>Wednesday's surge in stock prices was fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that interest rates are now in the range of neutral territory and that the pace of hikes may slow, though he left another 75 basis point hike in September as a possibility.</p><p>See: Was Fed's Powell dovish or not? 4 key takeaways from Wednesday's press conference</p><p>When it comes to corporate earnings, Meta Platforms META, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, late Wednesday reported worse than forecast profit and sales and guided to revenue below estimates in the current quarter.</p><p>See: Facebook revenue declines for first time, and Meta's downfall is expected to get worse</p><p>Earnings are due from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Mastercard MA after Thursday's market close.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Ford Motor Company F shares were up 6% in premarket trading after the carmaker reported a more than 50% increase in total sales during the second quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. SWKslid 15% ahead of the open on Thursday after the tool maker's second-quarter earnings fell far short of estimates.</p><p>* Pfizer Inc. PFE shares gained 0.3% in premarket trading Thursday after the pharmaceutical giant reported big second-quarter profit and revenue beats driven primarily by sales of its COVID drugs.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery CL.1 CLU22 rose $1.74, or 1.8%, to $99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>* Gold GC00 GCQ22for October delivery gained $17.80, or 1%, to trade at $1,736.90 per ounce.</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.4% as the Japanese yen weakened following the latest Bank of Japan meeting.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSDand ethereum prices ETHUSDsurged Thursday, with bitcoin trading north of $23,000 and ethereum above $1,600.</p><p>U.S. stocks turn lower, erasing part of spectacular post-Fed rally</p>",
