  "text": "<p>The dream of making automobiles appears to matter more to Wall Street than the actual manufacture of them. While electric self-driving start-up valuations soar, Ford's share price has travelled sideways over the past five years. </p> <p>Yet the Detroit stalwart may have some fuel left in its tank. Late on Tuesday, Ford announced it had lured <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45dc9e63-733a-430b-9e3f-926294f93901\">Doug Field away from Apple</a>. Field was the latest luminary to lead the $2tn Silicon Valley titan's secretive effort to create its own vehicle. But the auto ambitions of leader Tim Cook now appear doubtful. Apple's interest in autonomous driving seems more focused on software than vehicle production. Ford's own autonomous vehicle business has aggressive launch date targets — though these were pushed back by the pandemic. </p> <p>Until now, however, Ford has failed to convince investors of its ambitions on electrification and self-driving technology. A costly $11bn restructuring in 2018 allowed General Motors to pass it by. While old economy companies must prove that they can think progressively and stop fighting yesterday's war, their operational expertise appears under-appreciated by the markets.</p> <p>Even before the latest mania around electric and autonomous vehicle start-ups, Wall Street never got behind Ford and GM. Both were forced to carry tens of billions in excess liquidity after the financial crisis. The two stocks typically traded at less than seven times forward earnings before the pandemic. Even achieving a 10 per cent operating margin would be considered heroic for Ford.</p> <p>Both had difficulty balancing selling enough internal combustion vehicles today with making the costly investments in electric vehicle production for tomorrow. Ford's smaller scale relative to GM — the former producing about half as many vehicles — gave it the look of a runner-up.</p> <p>But Ford has stepped on the accelerator. Before the semiconductor shortage, sales of trucks and SUVs were solid. Ford's hyped F-150 electric truck has secured 120,000 orders and its Mustang Mach-E is the second-best selling electric SUV in America. Ford's shares have rebounded by nearly half in 2021, which gives it a market value of roughly $52bn.</p> <p>This still trails Tesla and even Rivian. The latter Amazon and Ford-backed EV truck start-up is seeking a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b45dce6-0cbd-4400-b93d-4c76edc81262\">$70bn initial public offering</a>, offering a pricier rival to Ford's own models. Ford will hope hiring Field away from Apple can add some air to its own valuation. </p> <p><em>Lex recommends the FT's Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.
