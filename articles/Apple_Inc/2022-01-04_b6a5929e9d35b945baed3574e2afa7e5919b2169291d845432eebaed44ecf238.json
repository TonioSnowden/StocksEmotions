  "text": "<p>The great pandemic baby boom may be a bust but there is one group who are showing considerably more interest in having children. With normality still on hold, the number of women choosing to undergo fertility preservation treatments is rising. According to New York-based fertility clinic Kindbody, egg-freezing procedures have doubled this year.</p> <p>Oocyte cryopreservation, or egg freezing, is one of the fastest growing treatments in fertility services. An entire start-up sector has evolved to encourage women to see it as a relatively low-stakes way to take control of their fertility. <a href=\"https://kindbody.com/\">Kindbody</a> is known for its pop-up clinics in distinctive yellow and white vans offering free fertility checks. Egg freezing, it says, is a way to “own your future”. Extend Fertility's adverts compared&#xa0;the cost to buying a frozen berry acai bowl every day, making it look more like a cosy lifestyle option than a surgical procedure. </p> <p>What the glossy adverts do not tend to mention is how likely the procedure is to work. One cycle can cost £8,000 in the UK and $15,000 in the US. Yet birth rates are less than one in five. &#xa0;</p> <p>Perhaps because Silicon Valley companies were the first to offer egg freezing as a corporate perk, there is a tech sheen to treatments that associates them with success. Facebook started the trend in 2014, with chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg a key advocate. Apple and Google followed soon after. Many companies work with third parties to provide employee fertility services. Uber offers benefits via Progyny, which went public in late 2019 and has a $4.5bn equity value.</p> <p>The UK is slowly moving in the same direction, encouraged by its own tech sector. In late 2020, Eileen Burbidge, the UK Treasury's special envoy for fintech, declared that more British companies should follow Silicon Valley's lead. “I'd love for us to get to a point where it's possible for all 20/30-somethings to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eileentso/status/1320043391095275520\">freeze their eggs</a>,” she tweeted. In the past year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f5d078a-662f-4943-a380-3881ce6f1114\">NatWest and Clifford Chance</a> have both expanded their benefits to include the treatment.</p> <p>Arguments against egg freezing as an employee perk see a dystopian corporate culture obsessed with squeezing more from workers at any cost. Women who freeze their eggs are assumed by many to be too busy girlbossing their way up the career ladder to have a family.</p> <p>Research suggests otherwise. Women are constantly hammered over the head with data on their declining fertility. Burbidge says employees, not companies, are the ones driving demand. A 2018 study by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30037349/\">Yale University</a> also found that most people who opted to freeze their eggs did so not because they prioritised their career but because they had yet to find a stable partner. &#xa0;</p> <p>But the emphasis on fertility treatments as insurance policy can be deceptively comforting. I have friends who underwent treatment and were not presented with any statistics on the likelihood of success. Finding data is not easy.</p> <p>This is partly because it is new. Until 2012, the US considered egg freezing an experimental procedure. Many women who have signed up for the process have not yet tried to use their eggs. &#xa0;</p> <p>For those who do come back in the hopes of becoming pregnant, the numbers are dispiriting. Data from the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority shows that in 2016, fewer than 200 women had fertility treatment in the country using their own thawed eggs. The birth rate was just 18 per cent. &#xa0;</p> <p>This is not the story told by Instagram ads. Nor do they focus on the fact that treatment is time-consuming and invasive, requiring days of self-administered hormone injections, regular scans and egg retrieval under sedation. Young women in their 20s have the best success rates but doctors can be wary of recommending a surgical treatment they may not need.</p> <p>Lord Robert Winston, emeritus professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, has called egg freezing a “very unsuccessful technology”. Even proponents admit the odds are poor. Success rates tend to be compared with IVF treatments, but the problem is that the birth rate for IVF itself is just <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/fertility-treatment-2019-trends-and-figures/\">24 per cent </a>per embryo transferred, according to the HFEA. Even for young women, every stage of freezing and thawing eggs, from collection to fertilisation and embryo development, carries with it a high risk of failure.</p> <p>Fertility, or lack of it, can be painful and upsetting. More options are welcome. But egg freezing is expensive, invasive and comes with low odds. A growing industry that encourages women to see its services as an insurance policy without clarifying the chance of success is offering little more than false hope. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:elaine.moore@ft.com\"><em>elaine.moore@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56082e47-2335-4534-b362-74e8ca959b17\"><em>Egg freezing is not perfect, but then neither is the alternative</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56082e47-2335-4534-b362-74e8ca959b17\"><em>From Professor Talya Miron-Shatz and Dr Avi Tsafrir</em></a></p><p>Source: Elaine Moore 2022 'The fertility industry may be offering women false hope' FT.com 4 January.
