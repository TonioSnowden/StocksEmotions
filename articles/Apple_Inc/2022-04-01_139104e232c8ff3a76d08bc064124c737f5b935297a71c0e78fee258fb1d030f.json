  "title": "State Department Warns of Continued Erosion of Freedoms in Hong Kong; For third year in a row, annual report finds Hong Kong doesn't deserve special treatment from U.S.",
  "text": "<p>The report comes a day afterthe resignation of two top U.K. judges from Hong Kong's highest court, citing dwindling political freedoms in the city, a move that highlighted lower international confidence in Hong Kong's reputation for upholding the rule of law and an independent judiciary.</p><p>The Hong Kong government in a statement said it remains committed to the rule of law, adding that Hong Kong's governance fell under the sovereignty of mainland China and demanded that other countries not interfere in China's affairs.</p><p>Following its handover from British rule in 1997, Hong Kong was guaranteed a greater degree of freedom than the mainland under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement. But the city's standing among international institutions has deteriorated sharply since Beijing's 2020 imposition of a national security law, which has been used to crack down on opposition activists, media outlets and civil society organizations.</p><p>The crackdown has continued over the past year, the State Department report said, pointing to developments including a legislative election overhaulthat left voters with fewer choices and the shutdown of two of the city's largest independent media outlets, Apple Daily and Stand News.</p><p>Authorities in China and Hong Kong \"targeted groups, associations, media companies, and labor unions affiliated with the region's pro-democracy movement with raids, arrests, prosecutions, and asset freezes, creating a chilling effect and forcing them and other organizations to cease operations,\" the report said.</p><p>Hong Kong's greater degree of openness compared with the mainland has long been a draw for foreign businesses. That community has begun to raise concerns about the rule of law and difficulties attracting talent to Hong Kong. Some American businesses have opted to relocate parts of their Hong Kong-based operations elsewhere, a senior U.S. official said.</p><p>The State Department is required to present a report each year on the status of Hong Kong's autonomy from the mainland under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The law states that the U.S. should encourage Hong Kong's prosperity and its status as an international financial center.</p><p>In 2020, the State Department report determined for the first time that Hong Kong's autonomy had diminished such that it was no longer deserving of special status.</p><p>The findings of each year's report don't directly trigger any U.S. action, but Washington has applied an array of sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials who are believed to have played a role in the city.</p><p>Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com</p><p>State Department Warns of Continued Erosion of Freedoms in Hong Kong</p>",
