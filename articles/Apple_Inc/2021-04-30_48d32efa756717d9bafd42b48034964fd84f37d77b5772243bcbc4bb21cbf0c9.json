  "text": "<p>   \"I don't come from wealth. I grew up in a 900-square-foot two-bedroom house in a town called Absecon, N.J., so for me every time I step into a property like that, it's surreal,\" he said. \"I was essentially broke when I started my YouTube channel and I was filming it on an iPhone editing with iMovie.\" </p><p>   His situation has changed dramatically. He recently allowed his viewers in on his personal search for a home, scoping out apartments in Soho and Tribeca priced at as much as $10,000 a month. </p><p>   Mr. Conover said he doesn't think it would be possible for newcomers to replicate his success now that the business has matured, unless they had a unique idea. </p><p>   \"You need high-quality cameras and proper editing,\" he said. </p><p>   YouTubers also have to tread carefully when it comes to biting the hand that feeds them luxury homes to film. Mr. Conover was having so much success with his channel over the past year that he was approached by a New York real-estate firm Nest Seekers International, which wanted him to get his real-estate license and become an agent. At the time, Mr. Serhant, the \"Million Dollar Listing New York\" star, had moved on from Nest Seekers to start his own company and the brokerage sought an agent who could replicate his YouTube following. </p><p>   \"We wanted to remain active in that space,\" said Eddie Shapiro, the chief executive of Nest Seekers, who said he wants his firm to be on top of the online trends. \"It's all about being progressive. It's like, are people buying $100 million homes on TikTok? I don't know that yet but I don't want to miss that boat if it comes.\" </p><p>   Now that he is an agent on the side, Mr. Conover said a small number of New York agents don't want him to film their listings -- they view him as competition. He said he doesn't mind so much since he thinks there are plenty of exciting properties for him to feature elsewhere. For those agents he is working with in New York, he assures them that he's a YouTuber first and an agent second. </p><p>   Mr. Yilmazer recently gave up his license because he felt it was limiting the access he could get to the biggest listings. He said he believes the ceiling on his YouTube career is higher. \"If you have a listing on the best sites like Redfin, Zillow at best maybe you get 30,000 or 40,000 clicks,\" he said. </p><p>   \"We're getting two to three million people to click on our videos and I believe we can scale that to 10 times bigger than what it is right now. That is, to me, that's incredible.\" </p><p></p>",
