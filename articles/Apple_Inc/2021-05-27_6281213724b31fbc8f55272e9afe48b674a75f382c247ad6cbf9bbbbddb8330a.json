The company said it would “carefully consider” the result.</p> <p>Campaigners hailed the day as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9e8e721-6d1c-4513-9034-3f6d99d983b8\">a breakthrough moment</a> as the urgency of the climate crisis arrived at the door of some of the world's biggest fossil fuel producers.</p> <p><em>Sign-up to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/859eba2b-705d-4f03-910b-e51bc417019f\"><em>Energy Source</em></a><em> for regular updates on the energy industry.</em></p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Joe Biden has asked <strong>US</strong> intelligence agencies to “redouble” their efforts to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57174621-3863-42b0-a39a-a36801fd7481\">investigate the origins</a> of Covid-19, amid renewed questions over the role a laboratory in China might have played.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> has called on members <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66a4b785-183a-48c6-9557-8621496d7c08\">to engage</a> with vaccine manufacturers to encourage IP sharing and tech transfers.</p></li>  <li><p>Scientists in<strong> Germany</strong> claim to have cracked the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76eb802-ec05-4461-9956-b250115d0577\">cause of the rare blood clots</a> linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>EU</strong> is set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd191c42-3509-42c6-8fd2-e617f16935ec\">demand billions of euros</a> from AstraZeneca if the company fails to increase deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine by next month. </p></li>  <li><p>Dominic Cummings,&#xa0;Boris Johnson's former chief adviser,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-003891fd-bb85-4fef-86d8-967b9401c3aa/mMNUpQ9emoTpc7Dl3KFcQw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRikUvXP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMDAzODkxZmQtYmI4NS00ZmVmLTg2ZDgtOTY3Yjk0MDFjM2FhP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBhZWM0OGE0YWI4NDAwMDA0MGU4MDgyJnNlZ21lbnRJZD02MGExMjZlOC1kZjNjLWI1MjQtYzk3OS1mOTBiZGU4YTY3Y2RXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpgru3GrmB8NrG-UhNnb3Jkb24uc21pdGhAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\">launched a stinging attack</a>&#xa0;on the <strong>UK</strong> prime minister over his handling of the Covid crisis.
