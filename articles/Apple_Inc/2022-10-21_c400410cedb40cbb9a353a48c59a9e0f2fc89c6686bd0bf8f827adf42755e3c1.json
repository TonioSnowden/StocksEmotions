  "text": "<p>It isn't as simple as using the \"official name,\" or the name that the United Nations recognizes. The bottom line: What name is most recognizable, while also trying to be on the right side of history?</p><p>Which brings us to ​Bengaluru, the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. We are now using that spelling rather than the name that is a legacy of British colonial rule, Bangalore. In 2005 we switched to Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata for what had been Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The proposal for the Bengaluru change wasn't official until 2014, and the topic didn't get revisited by us.</p><p>Tripti Lahiri, the Journal's New Delhi bureau chief, says that as the name ​Bengaluru ​has now been in use for years, we ​will now be consistent with the other official changes for India's largest cities​. \"It's understandable that we go a bit slowly with these​ changes,\" she says, \"There are always fresh name change proposals and though they all stem from some form of cultural or linguistic reassessment, in some cases the debates and name-change efforts can be more problematic than others.​\"​</p><p>For example, in 2019, we changed our spelling of Ukraine's capital to Kyiv, rather than Kiev. The country made the point that it was unfair to spell its capital in the Russian way, as it is Ukrainian. On the other hand, while some readers say we should switch to Odesa from the familiar spelling Odessa, we haven't made that change; our reporters say that Ukrainians aren't so focused on the double-s, since it is actually a Greek name anyway.</p><p>What's G-7?</p><p>We have updated our stylebook entry for the post-Cold War club, the Group of Seven, which was a bit archaic in its reference to \"leading nations,\" especially since the sizable economies of India and China are on the outside looking in.</p><p>The entry now says: The Group of Seven is a club of large advanced democracies that comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. We should avoid calling it a group of \"leading nations.\"</p><p>And yes, we and the Associated Press use a hyphen in the abbreviated form, G-7, though many official bodies don't (G7).</p><p>A private note</p><p>​We have sometimes written that people (unnamed, but usually part of a specific group) are saying something ​privately.</p><p>​Deputy Editor in Chief Neal Lipschutz notes that it looks odd to include a fact with this labeling in an article. \"Someone has said it to us, knowing it is for publication, so it really is no longer private,\" says Neal. \"It also is vague.\" Instead, we should be more precise. Is this something people in a certain group are discussing among themselves? Something they have said (to us) not for attribution? Something they have said (to us) anonymously?</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* To forego means to go before, as in foregone conclusion. But note that the spelling is forgone in a phrase such as justice forgone, because to forgo means to abstain from.</p><p>* ​Our plural of headscarf is headscarves (not headscarfs).</p><p>* It's hurricane season. Let's use words to describe hurricane activity other than \"lashes.\"</p><p>* And it's about to be Christmas season. As we plead every year, let's avoid 'Tis the Season headlines or leads unless you really come up with a clever twist.</p><p>* Compared with/compared to: In some articles on economic indicators or other data, we have incorrectly used compared to. As the stylebook says, use compared with when comparing such similar data. (Use compared to when the purpose is to liken dissimilar things, often fancifully: He compared the stock market to a hockey game.)</p><p>* A reminder that we don't use honorifics with historical figures. Unless it is soon after a death, such as in an obituary, a Mr. or Ms. rings odd. It's just Washington, Brahms, Bowie, Ginsburg.</p><p>* Pharmacists increasingly hold doctorates; some use the Dr. title and some don't. In general we use Dr. for individuals who are called doctor in their professions and desire the title, including holders of Ph.D.s.</p><p>* Don't use hyphens after -ly adverbs. An overly aggressive executive. The Journal tends to be warm to hyphens, but as the stylebook says, no hyphen is required with very and with -ly adverbs because readers can expect them to modify the word that follows.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Why Does the Web Still Mangle Names? Ask Mr. Stüvel,\" by Matthew Rose.</p><p>* \"The Two Words That Terrify Junior Employees,\" by Vivyan Tran.</p><p>* \"Historic Bridge Eats Vehicles by the Dozen. 'I haven't seen a bridge win yet,' \" by Carrie Dolan and Jennifer Levitz.</p><p>Heads that make you go 'hmmm'</p><p>* \"​Prices Investors Get for Trades Varies Widely.\" Prices, a plural, takes the verb Vary.</p><p>* \"Peloton to Cut Another 500 Jobs in Last Bid for Turnaround.\" Better to say: 500 More Jobs. (Another, which implies the same number as before, isn't a synonym for an additional.)</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* The new tax brackets for 2023 were just announced—and there are big changes because of inflation. Here's what to know.</p><p>* A pair of jeans from the 1880s sold for $76,000. The pocket had a troubling message.</p><p>* How a diabetes drug became the talk of Hollywood and the Hamptons. \"Everybody I know is on it.\"</p><p>* There's a new menace stalking suburbia. Meet the McBasement.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* A homeowner sometimes has the option of buying a solar system they've been leasing.</p><p>* From 1939, it became a maximum-security prison for…POWs considered likely to try and escape.</p><p>* Minh K Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad, thinks Reliance and Adani are in a somewhat unique position globally.</p><p>* He said the [American Airlines/JetBlue] alliance incentivized growth rather than profit-sharing.</p><p>* Ms. Anderson also recommends that a homeowner who knows their warranty is coming to an end initiate a service call.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* A solar system he or she has been leasing. The stylebook says the \"singular they\" still isn't good grammar but is acceptable in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns. Another solution is to go plural: Homeowners sometimes have the option of buying solar systems that they have been leasing.</p><p>* Those likely to try to escape. The \"try and\" phrase is how many people speak, but it isn't good grammar.</p><p>* Unique means one of a kind. So it shouldn't be qualified. As the stylebook says, other phrases to avoid are rather unique or most unique.</p><p>* Incentivize is hackneyed, best left to business jargon. Better choice: encouraged.</p><p>* His or her warranty, or go plural.
