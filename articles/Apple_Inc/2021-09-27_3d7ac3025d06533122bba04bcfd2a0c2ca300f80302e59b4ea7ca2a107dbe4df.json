  "text": "<p>Exor is the holding company controlled by Italy's Agnelli family that also holds stakes in Stellantis—of which Chrysler and Fiat are part of—and the Italian soccer team Juventus F.C.</p><p>Ferrari declined to reveal the specifics of the collaboration, but said it sees potential in working with LoveFrom across the whole range of its business. Alongside its legacy production of its engine-powered cars, the company sells clothes, watches and other apparel.</p><p>Ferrari said in April that its first battery-powered vehicle would hit showrooms in 2025.</p><p>LoveFrom is set to work with Exor on other projects outside of the Ferrari brand. John Elkann, chairman and chief executive of Exor, and chairman of Ferrari, said the holding company had started talks with LoveFrom's founders soon after they formed the design firm.</p><p>\"Ferrari represents a first, exciting chance to do great things together as we build our future,\" Mr. Elkann said.</p><p>Luxury car makers and auto giants are expected to drive more than a dozen electric models into U.S. showrooms this year, competing for drivers alongside stand-alone EV startups such as Lucid Motors Inc. and Rivian Automotive LLC, as well as electric flag-bearer Tesla Inc.</p><p>Meanwhile Apple, Mr. Ive's former employer, is said to also be exploring a move into automotive as the industry and its customers embrace electrification. Ford Motor Co. earlier this month hired Apple vice president Doug Field, who was reported to play a critical role in the tech company's automotive ventures.</p><p>Mr. Ive assumed leadership of Apple's design team in 1996. He spearheaded the 2015 launch of the Apple Watch, and worked on the company's new headquarters which opened in 2017.</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>Ferrari Hires Former Apple Designer Jony Ive Ahead of Electric Push</p>",
