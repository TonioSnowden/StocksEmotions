The S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell 0.5% to 4,326 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP slid 1.4% to finish at 13,352.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>A potential rebound for tech stocks, driven by Apple AAPL, comes as the Nasdaq faces its longest weekly losing streak since Nov. 2012 — it was down 3% as of Thursday. For the month, the Nasdaq has lost around 14%, putting it on pace for the worst monthly performance since Oct. 2008, the depths of the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>Apple shares rose 5% in premarket trade after the iPhone maker sailed past Wall Street's earnings expectations for the holiday quarter, and executives forecast continued revenue growth in the current quarter.
