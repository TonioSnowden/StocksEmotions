  "text": "<p>“I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there.”</p> <p>With those words Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aad74276-bafd-4090-ab2a-6000ed4a1187\">plunged a knife</a> into Joe Biden's economic agenda.</p> <p>The declaration on <em>Fox News Sunday </em>ends weeks of negotiation between the White House and Manchin over Biden's signature $1.75tn social spending bill. </p> <p>Manchin went on to explain his reasoning for his opposition to the bill, which includes new social investments in areas such as childcare and the fight against climate change, <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act\">in a statement</a> released after his television interview: “My concerns have only increased as the pandemic surges on, inflation rises and geopolitical uncertainty increases around the world.”</p> <p>The senator's statement raises the risk the Build Back Better bill will never pass Congress and led to an angry response from moderates in the president's Democratic party. </p> <p>“That is unacceptable,” said Abigail Spanberger, a Democratic Representative from Virginia. </p> <p>Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, directed some of her harshest comments yet at Manchin. She said his words represented “a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the president and the senator's colleagues in the House and Senate”.</p> <p>The setback comes as the president's approval ratings have reached their highest level in months. According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html\">Realclearpolitics.com</a> on average, 44.1 per cent of Americans approve of the job he's doing, while 50.3 per cent disapprove. That six-point gap is an improvement compared with the 12-point gap one month ago.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper</strong> The expansion of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f4f23ca-304f-4738-807f-17a24ca6e82c\">the Child Tax Credit</a> was one of the sticking points for Manchin. The cheques were the US's first&#xa0;experiment&#xa0;with the type of child allowances that are commonly paid to parents in other developed nations.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you support Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill or are you glad it is in peril?
