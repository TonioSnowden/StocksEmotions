  "title": "Will Smith Faces Disciplinary Action From Academy for Slapping Chris Rock at Oscars; Best actor winner was asked to leave the ceremony and refused; suspension, expulsion, other sanctions are possible",
  "text": "<p>In a statement, the academy also said that it asked Mr. Smith to leave the Dolby Theatre after the incident.</p><p>\"Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,\" the academy said. \"While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith slapped Chris Rock on the Oscars stage after Mr. Rock made a joke about Mr. Smith's wife's hair. Jada Pinkett Smith has said on social media that she has alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss.</p><p>Shortly after the confrontation, Mr. Smith accepted the award for best actor for his work in \"King Richard.\" Some people in the crowd gave the actor a standing ovation for his tearful speech.</p><p>Though Mr. Smith apologized to the academy in his acceptance speech, he didn't express regrets to Mr. Rock. That came a day later, when Mr. Smith released a statement on his Instagram directly addressing the comedian.</p><p>\"I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,\" he wrote. \"I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith framed Mr. Rock's joke as an intentional jab at his wife's illness. \"Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally,\" he wrote.</p><p>The academy, which oversees the Oscars, initially condemned Mr. Smith's actions in a statement on Monday and initiated a formal review of the incident, vowing to \"explore further action and consequences\" in accordance with its own rules and state law.</p><p>On Wednesday, the academy apologized to Mr. Rock directly.</p><p>\"Mr. Rock, we apologize to you for what you experienced on our stage and thank you for your resilience in that moment,\" the academy said.</p><p>Mr. Rock has been quiet about the Oscars incident so far. He briefly alluded to it Wednesday at a comedy performance in Boston on the first night of a scheduled tour.</p><p>\"I'm still kind of processing what happened,\" he said, before moving to other subjects in his planned routine.</p><p>For Mr. Smith, potential repercussions for the slap could include revoking his academy membership, according to the organization's guidelines. The academy even has the authority to take back its Oscar, a highly unpopular move according to a poll taken the day after the Oscars. Seven in 10 Americans said they believed Mr. Smith should be allowed to keep his award, according to a poll of 1,319 people taken on March 28 by the research company YouGov.</p><p>Mr. Smith is awaiting the release of \"Emancipation,\" a film from his production company in which he plays a runaway slave. Before the controversy, Hollywood executives had been talking about the film, and Mr. Smith's performance in it, as possible Oscar contenders for this time next year. The movie purchased by Apple TV+, the streaming platform owned by Apple Inc. behind this year's best picture winner \"CODA,\" has been slated to be released in late 2022, the height of Oscars season.</p><p>John Jurgensen contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com</p><p>Will Smith Faces Disciplinary Action From Academy for Slapping Chris Rock at Oscars</p>",
