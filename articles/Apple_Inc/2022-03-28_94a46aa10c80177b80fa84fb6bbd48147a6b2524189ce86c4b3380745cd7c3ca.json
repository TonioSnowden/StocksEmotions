AMZN,&#xa0;Alphabet&#xa0;Inc.'s GOOGL&#xa0;GOOG Google,&#xa0;Apple&#xa0;Inc.&#xa0; AAPLand others&#xa0;oppose the proposed legislation, saying it would make it harder to offer popular services. The bills' opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations' popularity.</p><p>The department's letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms' dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms' conduct&#xa0;would carry significant benefits.</p><p>“Discriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,” the letter says.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Will Smith apologizes to Chris Rock, faces Academy investigation for slap.</p><p>How Russia's central bank engineered the ruble's rebound.</p>",
