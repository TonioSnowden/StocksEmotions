  "text": "<p>One short year ago, Airbnb was staring at oblivion: demand had fallen off a cliff, and no one knew what long-term impact the pandemic would have on travel.<br><br>Given those circumstances, you suspect Nate Blecharczyk, one of the site's three co-founders, is relieved to be facing today's problem: there may not be enough Airbnbs to go round as travellers gain confidence and get moving.&#xa0;</p> <p>The number of active hosts on the platform — around 4m — has been mostly flat for the past six months.</p> <p>Today, the company <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/\">announced new features</a> to tackle that problem. First, it has added options for flexible searches, for people who, now less tethered by work, are relaxed about exactly when or exactly where they travel.<br><br>“They aren't looking just for Memorial day weekend,” said Blecharczyk, speaking to #techFT. “They have a lot more latitude in terms of when they travel, to take advantage of the availability and price.”<br><br>Second, the company has streamlined the process for new hosts looking to sign up. New features include allowing hosts to use public records data to autofill their listings with relevant information and gauge appropriate pricing for the area. It is also introducing AI tools such as image recognition to automatically arrange pictures in ways most likely to appeal to potential guests.<br><br>You can <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/2021\">read all 103</a> of the changes here, though some of the “upgrades” are something of a stretch. Number 57, for instance, is a “new listing welcome”: a picture of Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky, and his dog Sandy, will be displayed alongside a thank you for signing up.<br><br>Other upgrades are designed to set Airbnb up for what CEO Brian Chesky has described as “the biggest [travel] rebound in a century”, one it doesn't want to let slip to its rivals. One aspect the company is particularly confident in is a new age of business travel.<br><br>“I think for the one-day business trip, the two-day business trip, that use case . . . I don't expect that to come back,” said Blecharczyk. “I expect there to be more week-long trips, especially if people are working remotely and coming to HQ or whatnot.”<br><br>He added: “I think that segment is really interesting for Airbnb. If you're going to be on a business trip for a week or more, you'd like to have your own space. Maybe you're bringing your significant other. A home makes a ton of sense. So I think that's pretty permanent.”<br><br>But that can only happen if there are enough hosts, and so these latest initiatives come as no surprise to analysts.<br><br>“I think it's clear why [Airbnb] are focusing on host acquisition,” said Steven Jankowski from short-term rental analysts AllTheRooms. “Even before Covid-19 hit, their host growth was slowing, and it still looks pretty flat as the virus recedes and we reopen.”<br><br>Richard Clarke, a travel analyst at Bernstein, said that Airbnb also faced greater competition from both online travel agencies such as Expedia and Booking.com and regional players and hotel companies that had invested in self-catered lets during the coronavirus emergency.<br><br>He also noted that early in the pandemic, Airbnb had forced hosts to refund guests affected by travel bans, resulting in “an element of disquiet” among property owners. “People fear that they risk cancellation more than at other platforms because [Airbnb] does have very flexible terms,” Clarke said.<br><br>Since the start of the pandemic, many of Airbnb's bookings have migrated to destinations outside dense urban areas, previously the bedrock of its business. For instance, the company said that so far in 2021, there had been more searches on Airbnb for places to stay in Cornwall than in London.</p> <p>That shift, Airbnb has said, is the key driver behind higher prices.&#xa0;The average daily rate for an Airbnb stay in the first quarter of this year rose to $160, up 35 per cent on the same period in 2020, according to company filings.</p> <h1>The Internet of (Five) Things</h1> <p><strong>1. Jack Ma to step down from academy</strong><br>Alibaba founder Jack Ma will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/296d2cce-92ca-438e-aa56-f1c3fc4174f3\">step down as president</a> of the elite business academy he founded six years ago, people familiar with the matter told the FT, as Beijing cracks down on the billionaire's influence across Chinese society. Hupan University, an executive training programme that is reputedly as hard to get into as Harvard University, will also restructure its educational programme and has changed its name.

The trend to straight-to-streaming</strong><br>Early at-home movie rentals were a necessary experiment during the pandemic. But as the US reopens after a year of empty cinemas, executives across the entertainment industry are questioning whether the industry has changed forever. Smaller-budget films, which don't need to earn hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket sales to break even, may increasingly become an at-home experience, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad4cd925-9517-4859-83fc-10d8acb46208\">reports Anna Nicolaou</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.
