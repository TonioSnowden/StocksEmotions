In basic description, it is a slightly larger version of the standard Bolt EV, with the same electric powertrain, but all its body panels are new.</p><p>We've always liked the Chevrolet's Bolt EV, but we had one gripe: Its back seat was a little too cramped for adults. Now, though, with the debut of the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV (Electric Utility Vehicle), that has changed. Thanks to a wheelbase that has been stretched by 3 inches and an overall length up by about 6 inches, the new Bolt EUV is a still relatively compact 5-door hatchback, but it's one that treats back seat passengers to an extra 3 inches of legroom.</p><p>ChevroletThe 2022 Bolt EUV is based on the same platform as the Bolt EV, and it even has the exact same 65-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and 200-horsepower electric motor. But because it's about 90 pounds heavier than a standard Bolt EV, its range has dropped from that car's 259 miles to 247.</p><p>Also notable: The new Bolt EUV is the first Chevrolet available with&#xa0;Super Cruise,&#xa0;the hands-free autonomous driving system typically associated with Cadillac.</p><p>While we struggle a bit with calling a compact front-drive hatchback a utility vehicle, we're pleased to report that Chevrolet has priced the new 2022 Bolt EUV at $33,000, some $4,500 less than the 2021 Bolt EV.</p><p>The new Bolt EUV is built in the same Michigan plant as the standard Bolt EV. Competitors include the Hyundai Kona EV, Kia Niro EV, and the Nissan Leaf.</p><p>2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV pricing</p><p>The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV goes on sale this summer. The base model, the Bolt EUV LT, has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $33,000, plus a $995 destination charge. The better-equipped Bolt EUV Premiere, with available Super Cruise, starts at $37,500.</p><p>There's also a special Launch Edition of the 2022 Bolt EUV. Equipped with Super Cruise, a panoramic sunroof, unique wheels, and an illuminated charge port, the Launch Edition Bolt EUV starts at $42,500. Online orders are being taken now.</p><p>While there are no federal incentives with the Bolt EUV, some state, local, or utility incentives may apply.</p><p>Read: Here's a guide to electric vehicle tax credits </p><p>Which model is right for me?</p><p>2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV LT</p><p>200-horsepower AC synchronous electric motor65-kWh lithium-ion battery packDual-level charge cord</p><p>2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Premiere</p><p>200-horsepower AC synchronous electric motor65-kWh lithium-ion battery packAvailable Super Cruise</p><p>2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Launch Edition</p><p>200-horsepower AC synchronous electric motor65-kWh lithium-ion battery packSuper CruisePanoramic sunroofUnique alloy wheelsIlluminated charge port</p><p>Driving the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV</p><p>The Bolt EUV's powertrain is essentially the same as the outgoing model. And that's no bad thing because acceleration is very strong. Press the Sport mode button and the little SUV will squeal its front tires when you floor the throttle. That's certainly fun but most buyers will be more interested to know that the Bolt EUV has made big strides in comfort.</p><p>The remodeled interior is better in every way. The new push-button shifter is easy to use and frees up some cabin space. Gone are those thin, odd, and springy seats of the old Bolt. The new ones are not only more comfortable but on our top Premier model, power-operated too. Rear seat passengers will appreciate the EUV's stretched wheelbase because there's plenty of legroom for a 6-footer. Downside? Adults still need to duck their heads slightly to slide back there. Once inside, headroom in the rear seat is sufficient, even with the panoramic sunroof.</p><p>Chevy retuned the suspension of the EUV, and that really improves the ride. It soaks up bumps with smoothness and composure the old model never had. The EUV's trim proportions make it easy to maneuver in the city. And engaging one pedal drive mode provides enough drag that you never have to touch the brake pedal.</p><p>The Bolt EUV is quiet too. Chevy bolstered the Bolt EUV's serenity at freeway speeds by including acoustic windshield glass. Speaking of freeway driving, our Bolt was equipped with GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving tech. It works well at maintaining speed, lane discipline, and slowing down smoothly when traffic flow drops abruptly. But sometimes the system makes frequent small steering corrections, which can get irritating. Still. this is great tech to have on an EV in this class.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Like the standard Chevy Bolt EV, the new Bolt EUV has generous front headroom but a significantly more spacious back seat with 3 extra inches of legroom. Behind that folding rear seat is 16.3 cubic feet of cargo room, a bit less than the 16.6 you'll find in the standard Bolt EV. The Bolt EUV has 56.9 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seat folded, basically the same as the 57.0 found in the standard Bolt EV. Where, we must ask, is the added utility of this EUV Bolt?</p><p>You might like:2 hybrids compared: The 2021 Kia Niro and the 2021 Hyundai Ioniq</p><p>On a positive note, the whole Bolt interior comes redesigned for 2022. Chevrolet says that Bolt customers, a loyal lot, wanted more comfort, better seats, extra rear-seat room, and added infotainment options in the new model. To that end, the Bolt's whole dash has been redesigned with an 8.0-inch color gauge cluster and a 10.2-inch touchscreen with a more intuitive interface. What's more, in addition to generally higher quality materials, there are better seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel (with a “Regen on Demand” paddle), and a new electronic gear shifter with toggles and buttons.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV looks similar to its slightly smaller Bolt EV sibling, but these two electric Chevrolets don't share a single body part.</p><p>From the front, the upright fascia and sculpted grille of the Bolt EUV shout “electric car” to us, while the slanted character lines on the body sides add a handsome flair while giving the vehicle a sense of motion, even when it's parked. The Bolt EUV is a compact vehicle, but it has a planted and muscular look, thanks to short front and rear overhangs and wheels pushed out wide to the corners.</p><p>LED lighting is used front and rear, and the thin high-mounted headlight strips double as sequential turn signals. Standard roof rails enhance the quasi-SUV aura of this newest Bolt.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Dual-Level Charge CordThis handy charging cord, standard on the new Bolt EUV, allows this compact electric Chevrolet to be plugged into a standard 3-prong 120-volt outlet for Level 1 charging, or a 240-volt outlet for Level 2 charging at up to 7.2 kilowatts.</p><p>Super CruiseThis feature, standard on the Bolt EUV Launch Edition, allows hands-free autonomous driving on roughly 200,000 miles of highways in the U.S. and Canada. If the Bolt EUV driver doesn't stay focused on the road, visible and audible alerts will notify the driver to take control of the vehicle.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Standard features on the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV start with a 65-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and 200-horsepower electric motor, both coming straight from the standard Bolt EV.</p><p>Other standard Bolt EUV hardware includes LED front and rear lighting, cruise control, and a dual-level charging cord that facilitates charging at home. Chevrolet covers the standard installation costs of a Level 2 charger at eligible Bolt buyers' homes.</p><p>In addition to an efficiency-enhancing one-pedal driving mode, the 2022 Bolt EUV is available with Chevy Safety Assist, a standard safety suite that includes automatic emergency braking (with pedestrian detection), lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>Options on the 2022 Bolt EUV include a panoramic sunroof, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto, and Super Cruise, which is optional on the Bolt EUV Premiere. Also available are other driver-assist features such as rear cross-traffic alert and a 360-degree surround-view camera, plus wireless smartphone charging and a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot. Apps like Alexa and Spotify SPOT also can be ordered on the Bolt EUV.</p><p>Battery power, charge times, and range</p><p>The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV is powered by a 150-kilowatt permanent magnet electric motor fed electricity from a liquid-cooled 65-kWh lithium-ion battery mounted low in the chassis.</p><p>Using a 240-volt Level 2 charger, the Bolt EUV can be fully recharged in roughly 7 hours. With 120-volt home charging, it takes considerably longer. Chevy says you can get 4 miles of range with a 1-hour charge using a 120-volt charger.</p><p>Much better is a 240-volt DC Fast Charger, which will get you 100 miles of range in approximately 30 minutes. We could see this helping to make long trips in an EV much easier, perhaps even possible.</p><p>Learn more:How to choose the right charger for your electric car</p><p>The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV is rated by the EPA at 125 MPGe in the city and 104 MPGe on the highway. Because the Bolt EUV is about 90 pounds heavier than a standard Bolt EV, its max range drops from 259 miles to 247.</p><p>See:How much range is enough in an EV?</p><p>AC synchronous electric motor65-kWh lithium-ion battery pack200 horsepower266 lb-ft of torqueEPA city/highway fuel economy: 125/104 MPGeEPA range: 247 miles</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.</p>",
