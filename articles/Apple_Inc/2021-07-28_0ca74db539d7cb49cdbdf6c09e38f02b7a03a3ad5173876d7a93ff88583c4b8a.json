  "text": "<p>Big Tech profits have surged to unexpected heights even as the global economy starts to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic that gave a boost to the biggest technology companies last year.</p> <p>Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18cfeb9a-8596-4d23-badd-df9a62d510ab\">reported revenues and earnings</a> above already optimistic expectations, making tech groups among the biggest beneficiaries of this year's gradual recovery, just as they proved to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8251e5f-10a7-4f7a-9047-b438e4d7f83a\">most resilient sectors</a> during the Covid-19 downturn.</p> <p>The three US tech groups brought in combined after-tax profits of almost $5bn a week during the latest quarter. At $56.8bn, the total was almost double the year before and 30 per cent more than Wall Street had predicted.</p> <p>Jim Tierney, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, described the results as “absolutely stunning”. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“I think the takeaway is, all the digital habits that we picked up over the past 12 months, they're going to stick with us when we come out of this.”</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Keep up with the latest technology industry news by </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/56703b20cb56e617eb2c4084/subscribe/success\"><em>signing up</em></a><em> to our daily </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/techft\"><em>#techft newsletter</em></a><em>. </em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

In an emotional day of testimony, Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Illinois, held back tears as he called his party's approach to the hearings “toxic”.</p> <p><strong>2. Horizon Kinetics bets on property and cypto </strong>The $7bn contrarian investment firm, one of the year's best-performing US fund managers, is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/a0fb31c3-e2af-4a9a-b374-a657e030ab9d\">betting on property</a> and cryptocurrencies to protect its investors against rising inflation. “There is no turning back after the pandemic and globally there is a debt problem and it means either default or currency debasement,” co-founder Peter Doyle tells the Financial Times.</p> <p><strong>3. Chinese tech sell-off slows </strong>A sharp sell-off in Chinese stocks slowed today as investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/097879d6-a845-4c11-89fc-69f50f9021df\">caught their breath</a> after Beijing's crackdown on education and technology companies prompted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f958def-6657-4283-8998-2954909a3465\">an epic rout</a> this week.
