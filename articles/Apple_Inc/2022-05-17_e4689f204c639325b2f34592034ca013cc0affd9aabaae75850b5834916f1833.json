  "title": "The 2022 Honda CR-V hybrid vs. the Toyota RAV4 hybrid—which is better? It's not an easy choice: you'll get impressive fuel efficiency, safety features, comfort and design from both. It could come down to price.",
  "text": "<p>2022 Honda CR-V Hybrid</p><p>The Honda HMC CR-V Hybrid, which starts at a price of $32,010, is motivated by a gas-electric hybrid powertrain producing 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. That gives it more power than the standard, non-hybrid CR-V while returning better fuel economy and giving you the benefit of standard all-wheel drive. Additionally, the EPA rates this SUV at 40 city/35 highway/38 combined mpg.</p><p>Honda CR-V Hybrid highlights</p><p>Roomy back seats: Both of these SUVs are pretty spacious, but the CR-V has more than two additional inches of rear-seat legroom compared to the RAV4. This is part of what makes the CR-V Hybrid a great SUV for families. Kids and adults alike will be plenty comfortable in the back of the CR-V, plus there's plenty of cargo space, too.</p><p>Honda Sensing: The Honda Sensing suite of driver assistance tech features comes standard on every CR-V Hybrid. This system bundles a collision mitigation braking system, a road departure mitigation system, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, and lane-keeping assist system. Blind-spot monitoring also comes standard in the CR-V Hybrid. These features make driving safer and easier, especially on the highway.</p><p>Rich interior: We find the CR-V's passenger cabin more appealing than the RAV4's. The materials and design convey a warmer, more premium feel, which includes leather-trimmed seats and ambient lighting that's available in the upper trims.</p><p>2022 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid</p><p>The Toyota TM RAV4 Hybrid has a similar powertrain as the CR-V Hybrid. It's a 2.5-liter hybrid inline-4 that makes 219 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. This is the more fuel-efficient option, returning 41 city/38 highway/40 combined mpg. This SUV also comes standard with AWD and has a starting price of $29,575.</p><p>Toyota RAV4 Hybrid highlights</p><p>Better fuel economy: Both of these SUVs are fuel-efficient, but the RAV4 Hybrid is the more economical of the two. With a combined fuel economy rating of 40 mpg, the RAV4 Hybrid has super-low fuel costs of only $1,550 per year, according to the EPA. It also comes standard with AWD like the CR-V Hybrid, which is great for drivers in snowy climates.</p><p>Check out: 7 off-the-radar places worth stopping on a California road trip</p><p>Lower starting price: The RAV4 Hybrid has a lower starting price than the CR-V Hybrid by over $2,400. It's also packed with value. Even the base LE trim includes features like AWD, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa, and many safety tech features. In the loaded top trims of these two SUVs, pricing is very similar.</p><p>Toyota Safety Sense 2.0: The standard Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 comes with a few extra features over the Honda Sensing system. Safety tech features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, automatic high beams, lane-departure alert with steering assist, lane tracing assist, and road sign assist.</p><p>Read: Death to the car dealership — the Tesla sales model is poised to take over America</p><p>Similarities</p><p>* Standard all-wheel drive</p><p>* Excellent fuel economy</p><p>* Many standard safety features</p><p>* Standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay</p><p>* Similar sizing</p><p>Also see: 8 simple rules to maximize wealth—at any age</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The CR-V and RAV4 are two of the best-selling vehicles in the country, available with two of the best hybrid powertrains.
