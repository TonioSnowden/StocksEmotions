  "title": "U.S. News: Raimondo Says Auto Makers Can't Cut Line for Chips",
  "text": "<p>\"They are really struggling,\" Ms. Raimondo said of auto makers. But she cited other chip users dealing with the crunch, including electronics and medical-device makers. Ms. Raimondo said while she is making the case for the auto industry, she is not calling for it to get special treatment. \"I would not favor that approach; I have not been doing that,\" she said.</p><p>A global shortage of chips is hitting everything from appliances to laptops. Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. are among an array of tech companies that have seen sales slump because of the crunch, which intensified after people rushed to buy electronics of all kinds during the pandemic.</p><p>The automotive industry was among the first to suffer significant production setbacks from the shortage late last year, and it has lobbied the Biden administration to help it secure chips.</p><p>\"When you can't assemble a vehicle in the U.S. because you're missing a handful of semiconductors, that is an entirely different impact on the economy than the ability to put together a consumer electronic product in Asia,\" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford, GM and Stellantis NV, maker of Jeep and Chrysler.</p><p>\"We certainly support the goal of ensuring that all industries have all the semiconductors they need to meet consumer demand, but until that's the case we think it makes sense to give priority to the auto sector,\" Mr. Blunt said.</p><p>Leading trade groups for the semiconductor industry and consumer electronics say they oppose any preferential treatment for autos.</p><p>\"The chip shortage is affecting consumer tech companies across the board, from PCs and mobile devices to automotive audio manufacturers and auto makers,\" said Gary Shapiro, who heads the Consumer Technology Association.</p><p>Ms. Raimondo has held discussions with suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker. TSMC has said it is working closely with automotive customers and that providing supply is a top priority.</p><p>The chip shortage reflects a broader problem that will persist with the growth of electric vehicles, 5G and other technologies, Ms. Raimondo said, making a pitch for President Biden's plan for tens of billions in investments to spur domestic chip production and research and development. In the short term, she said, more transparency in the supply chain could help: \"A lot of this will come down to better forecasting and information sharing.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $50 billion for the American semiconductor industry.</p><p>The global chip shortage has forced auto makers to put some of their production on hold, costing the industry an estimated $110 billion of lost revenue this year, according to the New York-based consulting firm AlixPartners.</p><p>Auto makers canceled chip orders early in the coronavirus pandemic. When demand spiked late last year, factories were already committed to making chips for laptops and other hardware.</p>",
