  "text": "<p>Barclays' profits rebounded in the second quarter as an improving economic outlook allowed the UK bank to cut the amount set aside to cover coronavirus-related loan losses.</p> <p>The lender reported net income of £2.1bn, up from £90m in the same period last year and easily beating analysts' expectations for £1.4bn. Revenues for the period rose 1 per cent to £5.4bn, slightly more than the £5.3bn estimate.</p> <p>The outperformance was mainly down to a larger than forecast release of provisions built up last year to cover potential loan losses. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said the move demonstrated an “improved macroeconomic outlook and benign credit environment”. </p> <p>Staley also announced a £500m share buyback programme after a ban on payouts was lifted by the Bank of England earlier this month. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>ITV</strong> pledged to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed91c795-d698-414d-af46-bfb4d9996955\">reinstate its dividend</a> after advertising revenues rebounded. Reporting a 27 per cent recovery in first-half revenues from the year ago period to £1.6bn, ITV said it would not pay an interim dividend but planned to make a final payout for the year “assuming the economy continues to recover”. Interim pre-tax profit jumped to £133m compared with £15m in the first half of 2020 as ad revenue improved 29 per cent.</p> <p><strong>British American Tobacco</strong> reported better than expected first-half sales and left full-year guidance unchanged. The Lucky Strike maker said total revenue was £12.2bn in the six months ended June with resilient demand for cigarettes helping deliver 8.1 per cent organic sales growth, its best performance since 2015. Profit from continuing operations was down 3.7 per cent to £4.9bn. On next-generation products, BAT said the division was on a pathway to reach profitability by 2025 after US sales volumes of its Vuse e-cigarette nearly doubled.</p> <p><strong>Man Group</strong>, the hedge fund manager, pledged to spend another $100m on share buybacks after reporting $1.2bn of net inflows in the first half. Its interim results showed pre-tax profit rising to $280m from $55m a year ago.</p> <p><strong>Rathbone Brothers</strong> said funds under management and administration grew 8.2 per cent to £59.2bn in the first half. The fund manager said it was entering the second half “in a robust position” after posting an interim underlying pre-tax profit of £62.9m, versus £46m a year ago.</p> <p>Wealth manager <strong>St James's Place</strong> reported net inflows of £5.5bn in the first half, which grew funds under management to £143.8bn.</p> <p><strong>Aston Martin</strong> said trading has been in line with expectations after posting a £90.7m pre-tax loss for the first half. Revenue jumped 242 per cent to £498.8m as the car maker's rollout of its DBX model meant sales through wholesale channels more than trebled. </p> <p>Pub group <strong>Marston</strong>'s said sales since mid May have been better than expected, driven by investment in food and outdoor space as well as warmer weather and the Euro 2020 football tournament. Management called recent trading “encouraging” but cautioned that it was too early to extrapolate any meaningful trend. </p> <p><strong>Wizz Air</strong> targeted operating between 90 and 100 per cent of its 2019 capacity over July and August. The no-frills airline reported a €118.7m underlying net loss for the first quarter ended June after flying just 33 per cent of its available capacity. </p> <p><strong>Metro Bank</strong> posted a £138.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June, narrowing from a £240.6m loss the year before. An increase in commercial deposits meant total deposits grew by £500m to £16.6bn over the half, while the loan book grew 2 per cent to £12.3bn, it reported.</p> <p><strong>Sanne</strong>, the services outsourcer for hedge funds and alternative asset managers, said it remains in talks with private equity group Cinven over a potential takeover. Trading at the half-year point has been in line with expectations, Sanne added.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating whether <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-a63f4753-8bfa-4b01-81f7-dd83fd06b3ee/2FqACzpSyJqpfpkYfAeoLA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRi42ldP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvYTYzZjQ3NTMtOGJmYS00YjAxLTgxZjctZGQ4M2ZkMDZiM2VlP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjEwMGUwODgyMjE3YTEwMDA0ZTdmM2ZmJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpg_onkAGHloDBJUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">breached listing rules</a>&#xa0;in disclosures about the value of Oyu Tolgoi, a $6.75bn underground copper project in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, people familiar with the situation told the FT.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Booming demand for used cars in the US and houses in the UK helped drive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2372ebaa-d37f-4292-a207-9299e1ba1aa9\">a sharp increase</a> in second-quarter profits at <strong>Banco Santander</strong>, while <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> said it would ditch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09a57a07-ef2a-4adb-994f-5064dd808148\">a cost-cutting target</a> after delivering better than expected second-quarter results.</p> <p>A sharp sell-off in <strong>Chinese stocks</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/097879d6-a845-4c11-89fc-69f50f9021df\">slowed overnight</a> as investors caught their breath after Beijing's crackdown on education and technology companies prompted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f958def-6657-4283-8998-2954909a3465\">an epic rout</a> this week.

The three US tech groups brought in combined after-tax profits of almost $5bn a week during the latest quarter.
