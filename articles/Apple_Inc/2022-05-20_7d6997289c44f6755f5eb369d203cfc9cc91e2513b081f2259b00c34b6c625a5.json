  "title": "TSMC Eyes Building Singapore Plant --- Chip maker studies new project as a way to secure supply chain amid recent shortage",
  "text": "<p>A shortage of semiconductors has roiled many industries including car manufacturing since the beginning of last year, and several governments including the U.S. and Japan have sought to attract chip-production sites. Reducing the concentration of production in Taiwan and keeping leading-edge technology out of China's hands are also priorities for the U.S. and its allies.</p><p>\"Securing supply chains for essential components is a key issue for the Singapore government, and it is following in the footsteps of the U.S. and Japan,\" said one of the people familiar with the project.</p><p>A TSMC spokeswoman said: \"TSMC doesn't rule out any possibility but does not have any concrete plan at this time.\"</p><p>For the Singapore project, TSMC is studying the feasibility of production lines that would make seven- to 28-nanometer chips, another person familiar with the plans said. These chips are based on older production technologies and are widely used in cars, smartphones and other devices.</p><p>TSMC is ramping up investment in these chips, which have caused some of the worst supply-chain bottlenecks, including for Apple Inc. Having production sites in more countries brings the company closer to its customers in major markets and is a hedge against pandemic-era travel restrictions and other disruptions, TSMC executives have said.</p><p>TSMC has set a capital expenditure budget of $40 billion to $44 billion this year.</p><p>The company is building a $12 billion chip factory in Arizona and expects to receive support from a $50 billion chip-manufacturing incentive plan that Congress is weighing. TSMC is also building a new plant in Japan with financial help from the Japanese government and investment by Sony Group Corp.</p><p>Singapore is home to many major chip manufacturers and has been favored by semiconductor companies for its pool of skilled talent and well-established ecosystem of suppliers. Major chip makers like GlobalFoundries Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. of the U.S. as well as Germany's Infineon Technologies AG have a large presence in the Southeast Asian city-state.</p><p>Last year, GlobalFoundries said it would build a $4 billion chip plant in Singapore slated to open in 2023. In February, Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp., the world's fourth-largest contract chip maker, disclosed plans to spend $5 billion to expand its production in Singapore.</p><p>Singapore accounts for about 5% of global wafer fabrication capacity, trade and industry minister Alvin Tan said in January. Semiconductors are \"the fastest-growing segment of the electronics industry,\" he said.</p>",
