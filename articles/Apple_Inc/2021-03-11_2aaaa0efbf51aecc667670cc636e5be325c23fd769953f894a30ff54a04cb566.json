  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Cherry\" stars Tom Holland as an Iraq war veteran whose opioid addiction spirals into a series of bank robberies and unravels at the tempo of a caper.</p><p>Mr. Holland's unnamed character enlists in the Army during a temporary breakup with his girlfriend, Emily. When he gets home, he struggles with PTSD, is prescribed OxyContin, which both he and Emily embrace en route to heroin addiction. The movie begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+</p><p>Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel written in prison by Nico Walker. Jessica Goldberg, who co-wrote the script, says that when she read Mr. Walker's book, she was drawn by the personal and global aspect of the story. \"We still haven't figured out how to take care of our service members,\" she says. \"None of these issues have gone away. They just were eclipsed by all these other crazy things that happened in our world.\"</p><p>'Genera+ion'</p><p>(HBO Max)</p><p>When Zelda Barnz was 16, she started thinking about bits of prose and entries in her journal as the basis for a novel that she could spin into a TV show. She brought the idea to her father, Daniel Barnz, a screenwriter, who said, if the end goal is a TV show why don't you just write a TV show?</p><p>\"I really did not think this TV show was going to get made,\" Mr. Barnz says. \"Not because I didn't think the idea was great, but because the chances of any show getting made are very slim.\"</p><p>The experience yielded \"Genera+ion,\" a no-holds-barred look at the intimate, sometimes graphic, lives of a group of teens. It also transformed the relationship between the father and daughter. \"I definitely think that I feel more comfortable talking to him about more sensitive subjects than I did before: drugs, intimacy, all of that,\" says Ms. Barnz, now 19. \"He's very good at separating seeing me as his daughter and seeing me as his collaborator, which is important.\"</p><p>'Yes Day'</p><p>(Netflix )</p><p>In \"Yes Day,\" out Friday, Edgar Ramirez plays the father of three opposite Jennifer Garner. When the couple's kids proclaim their mom to be a suburban dictator ruling with an iron \"no,\" the parents propose a day in which they'll only (with a just a few rules) say yes. As the day progresses, it turns into a kind of family relationship reset.</p><p>Mr. Ramirez, seen recently in HBO's \"The Undoing,\" isn't a father in real life, but he is a champion of the yes day concept, calling it \"a great tool for the restoration of balance within any relationship.\"</p>",
