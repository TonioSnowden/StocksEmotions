This intensification of work doesn't seem to be making us richer, but it does appear to be making us sicker, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/e9835846-d88c-4947-a5ee-33a378ff9f65\">writes Sarah O'Connor</a>.</p> <p><strong>Taiwan: preparing for a potential Chinese invasion </strong>President Xi Jinping's ambitions and the modernisation of China's military are raising fears of an attempt to annex the island.

Liquidity across US markets is now at its worst level since the early days of the pandemic and the fraught conditions have collided with a big shift in the global economy that has caught many portfolio managers off-guard.</p> <p><strong>‘Buy now, pay later' must be regulated </strong>The business model has boomed during Covid-19 as people diverted spending to retail and shopped more online.
