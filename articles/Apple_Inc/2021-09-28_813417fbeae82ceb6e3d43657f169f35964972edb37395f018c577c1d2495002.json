  "text": "<p>   Government efforts to curb energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions, along with surging coal prices, are leading to power outages across many of China's manufacturing hubs, threatening to further disrupt strained global supply chains for semiconductors and other vital goods. </p><p>   Over the past week, local officials have forced factories in China's Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces to curtail operation hours or shut down temporarily as officials try to rein in energy use, according to company filings and interviews with company officials by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   In other areas, factories are cutting production because coal has become too expensive, a problem exacerbated by a Chinese ban on imports of the commodity from Australia since last year after a diplomatic brawl over Canberra's call for an independent global inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. </p><p>   In one of the most affected areas, Kunshan, a city in China's eastern Jiangsu province near Shanghai, more than 10 Taiwan-based semiconductor-related companies filed announcements with the Taiwan Stock Exchange this week saying they are temporarily closing local facilities until the end of September. </p><p>   Several Apple Inc. suppliers are affected, such as mechanical-parts maker Eson Precision Engineering Co. and Unimicron Technology Corp., a printed-circuit-board maker. </p><p>   An Apple spokeswoman didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. </p><p>   Another affected company, Chang Wah Technology Co., supplies chip-packaging material to automotive chip makers such as NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG. Although chip testing and assembly is usually less technologically complex than wafer fabrication, any interruption to the final stage of semiconductor production could add problems in a supply chain that has been tested this year by natural disasters and surging demand. </p><p>   \"If they stop for any amount of time there could be delays in products getting out,\" said Stewart Randall, head of electronics at the Intralink consulting firm in Shanghai. </p><p>   Other affected manufacturing companies include Taiwan-based Tung Thih Electronic Co., an electrical-equipment supplier to auto companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, which have struggled to keep up vehicle production amid a shortage of components. </p><p>   People familiar with the matter said many of the industrial plants in the area were affected by the mandated power cuts and it is still too early to estimate the loss. Calls to the Kunshan government office went unanswered late Monday. </p><p>   For companies operating in Kunshan and other similar areas, the problems have stemmed largely from China's efforts to curb energy consumption as the country tries to burnish its climate credentials ahead of a climate summit in Glasgow this November. </p><p>   The country's powerful economic-planning agency has set a target to cut energy intensity per unit of gross domestic product by about 3% from last year, as part of a bid by Beijing to reach peak emissions before 2030. </p><p>   The policy means, in effect, that electricity use has to grow at a lower rate than GDP. In the first half of 2021, however, electricity use rose 16.2%, while GDP increased 12.7%, with GDP expected to slow further in the second half of the year. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sha Hua contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
