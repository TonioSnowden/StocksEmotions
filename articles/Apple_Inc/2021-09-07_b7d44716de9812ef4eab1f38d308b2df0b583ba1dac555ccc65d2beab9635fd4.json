  "title": "Intel's Salvation Lies in Europe—but Not With Fabs; Chip giant needs prime access to cutting-edge tools from ASML to close its manufacturing gap with TSMC",
  "text": "<p>The move fits in with Intel's latest strategy of aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint—with the help of government subsidies—to meet demand for its own designs and to start producing chips designed by others. The latter option, known as a foundry business model, is a new one for Intel and puts the company into even more direct competition with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The chip-making giant also known as TSMC has pulled ahead of Intel in manufacturing technology and has helped rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia to challenge Intel in key markets. TSMC has also enabled tech giants including Apple Inc., Amazon.com and Google to design their own processors—which also take slots once occupied by Intel's chips.</p><p>Closing the gap with TSMC will require more than just additional fabs. The catch-up plan Intel outlined in July depends greatly on securing access to the next generation of chip-manufacturing equipment from ASML. The Dutch company effectively owns the market for extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV, tools that are required for the most advanced chip-making processes. During an investor presentation in late July, Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger touted the long working relationship between the two companies and added that Intel will adopt the latest EUV tools as soon as they become available.</p><p>That will effectively require Intel to jump to the front of a long line; EUV tools also are a priority for TSMC, Samsung, Micron Technology and pretty much anyone else working to stay on the leading edge of chip production. Intel's strategy to get there seems to involve throwing in vocal support early for the next generation of EUV, called high-Na. Intel said in July it plans to be the first in the industry to implement the still-unproven tools in production processes starting in 2025. Robert Maire of Semiconductor Advisors wrote in a note Tuesday that if Intel's gambit to get preferential access to those tools succeeds, \"that could be the difference to get Intel back in the Moore's Law game ahead of TSMC.\"</p><p>It won't be cheap. ASML is working to boost its own production output of EUV tools; current plans call for 55 tools next year and more than 60 in 2023. The company is expected to shed further light on its expansion plans at an analyst meeting at the end of this month. ASML's annual capital expenditure bill has risen sharply to a projected $1.2 billion this year compared with $657 million in 2018. Intel could easily augment that with the near $20 billion the chip maker is expected to spend annually on capex over the next three years, according to FactSet. But TSMC is now expected to spend more than $30 billion annually in that same time, though with its dominant position it may have less reason to take a risk on the still-developing technology.</p><p>Getting back in the lead when you are well behind requires bold moves. For Intel, Europe may hold the key in more ways than one.</p><p>Intel's Salvation Lies in Europe—but Not With Fabs</p>",
