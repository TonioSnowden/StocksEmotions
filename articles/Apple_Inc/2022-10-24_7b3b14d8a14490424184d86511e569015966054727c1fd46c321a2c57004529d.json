  "text": "<p>A few days before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/079edb28-17bc-4ab6-b107-6a54c696ac62\">Kanye West's “White Lives Matter” shirt</a> went off like a bomb at Paris Fashion Week, Cher was photographed at dinner with Rick Owens wearing a vintage Stephen Sprouse blazer emblazoned with “God Save N.Y.C.” — a reminder that a slogan on fabric can be a creative, sophisticated form of communication decades after it was first conceived.</p> <p>Sprouse, who died in 2004, created Cher's blazer as part of his punk-inspired relaunch in 1987. Monochrome photographs of the singer wearing it the first time around are regularly cited as one of the most significant fashion moments of her career. Sprouse was obsessed with the legacy and aesthetic of punk, but also in love with his city. He was also fascinated by the links between religion and rock — a year later he created prints bearing a crucified Iggy Pop. Sprouse used text on clothing with nuance.</p> <p>Decades before MAGA was plastered over red baseball hats, slogan T-shirts were conceived as powerful walking billboards. They got a message across directly and the detail of the typeface could add beauty and extra levels of meaning. They were content before the concept of “content” and their message is only amplified by social media.</p> <p>Slogans on clothing predate memes by decades and are wholly distinct from branding. Many of the most classic examples of the slogan T-shirt come from agitprop movements. ‘Silence = Death' became part of the iconography of the fight against AIDS. Similarly, photographs of the artist David Wojnarowicz wearing a leather jacket in 1988 with the legend “IF I DIE OF AIDS — FORGET BURIAL — JUST DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF THE F.D.A.” have passed from being fury-fuelled direct action into poignant social history.</p> <p>The technique that Wojnarowicz used as a one-off, as part of the harsh reality he was living and indeed dying through, was turned into a phenomenon by Katharine Hamnett in the same era. She created a series of slogan tees — including motifs about safe sex — with a supersized typeface that would read clearly when reproduced in newspapers and on TV. When she unfastened her coat to meet Margaret Thatcher at Downing Street in 1984, to reveal a “58% DON'T WANT PERSHING” slogan to protest the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it was intended to make headlines. And did. </p> <p>When she relaunched her label in 2017, it included her “CANCEL BREXIT” shirt. “It was a cry from the heart,” says Hamnett. “Three- or four-letter sentences work so well on a garment. They are perfect propaganda tools. You can't not read them. Anything you see written, it's inside your brain. You have no filter that defends you.” Hamnett decamped to Majorca when Brexit wasn't cancelled, and a subsequent design feels melancholy: “WHY BREXIT, MY FRIEND?”</p> <p>The medium of the slogan in high fashion has its roots in Chelsea in London. Mr Freedom, run by Tommy Roberts and Trevor Myles on the King's Road in the late 1960s, was one of the first labels to produce slogan tees and tops, with kitsch pop art mantras such as “GOD BLESS Woolworth's”. A few years later, Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood entered the space, and would use text in more radical ways. Their 1976 T-shirt “You're Gonna Wake Up One Morning” includes a long list of what the pair liked and did not like (Simone de Beauvoir and Joe Orton appear on the former list, The Archers and Mars bars make it on to the second).</p> <p>“The interplay of text, imagery, and the materiality of the garment that it's printed on, which resemble relics from a lost civilisation, transformed the everyday slogan T-shirt into something more subversive and poetic,” says professor Andrew Groves, director of the University of Westminster's Menswear Archive. “Unlike Hamnett's T-shirt, the use of tiny typewriter text makes it a much more intimate garment, requiring you to get closer to the person wearing it in order to read it, thus drawing you in on a much more physical, intimate level.”</p> <p>Done skilfully, writing on clothes can become an integral part of a designer's aesthetic, aligning it with their values. Take Raf Simons paying homage to Peter Saville's album covers, or the text-based artwork of Philippe Vandenberg that he incorporated in his recent London show, including a piece reading “Let's drink the sea and dance”, with a naive scrawl that makes the words unsettling. Look too at the penmanship of Yohji Yamamoto in his spring 2023 menswear collection: “What are you made of?” and “I'm so bored with rules”. Yamamoto — who has always created work that goes against the grain of the mainstream, and who has said “As long as I live, I will never wear a tie. Not even for my Emperor,” means every word.</p> <p>The use of text in fashion doesn't have to be political to have value. It can be lyrical or witty. “It's my birthday and all I got was this overpriced T-shirt from Vetements” is, to me, satirical and amusing.</p> <p>When Viktor &amp; Rolf created voluminous tulle gowns in January 2019, they went viral because of the slogans applied to the front: “SORRY I'M LATE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME” and “I'M NOT SHY I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU” are both wearable memes. Then there's Bella Freud's “Godard is Dog” sweater, which takes its cue from the 1970s “Clapton is God” T-shirt and is a modern classic. “The messages on people's clothes can be poignant and courageous, or just adoring,” says Freud. “You don't need to know who Ginsberg is to love the idea of him. ‘Ginsberg is God'. Why not?” The back of that now classic cashmere sweater has a second slogan: “Godard is dog”, which she says, “shows how artistic pronouncements can also mean nothing.”</p> <p>One of the most interesting young designers working with slogans today is Willie Norris, of Willie Norris Workshop in New York. Norris creates dynamic androgynous modern fashion and has created T-shirts that read “PROMOTE HOMOSEXUALITY” and “PROMOTE TRANSEXUALITY”. In an increasingly right-tilting landscape these are provocative and earnest statements.</p> <p>Sloganeering is alive and kicking. If anything, with social media, its agency has increased. “I see a slogan as an insurance plan,” says Norris. “It is thinking for the long haul. The world changes around a slogan and each change adds new value to the words. A slogan morphs from catchy to resonant to vital to spent to reminder to nostalgic to reborn. It's a friend to have along the way.”</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/170d5bce-29ef-42d4-8494-462fc4165c11\"><em>I feel another T-shirt slogan coming on</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/170d5bce-29ef-42d4-8494-462fc4165c11\"><em>From Mebs Loghdey, London W10, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Mark C O’Flaherty 2022 'A case for the slogan tee' FT.com 24 October.
