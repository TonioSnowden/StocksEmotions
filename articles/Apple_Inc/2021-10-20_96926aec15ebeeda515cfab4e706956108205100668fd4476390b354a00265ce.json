Range isn't great, and what it gains in looks it loses in space to the non-Sportback e-tron.</p><p>Also see:Lucid's second trick, the Gravity, is a full-size luxury crossover EV</p><p>2022 Tesla Model Y</p><p>2022 Tesla Model Y&#xa0;starting price:&#xa0;$53,990&#xa0;</p><p>TeslaAbove average:&#xa0;Good range; exciting performance; room for cargo; standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Ride is a bit stiff; no Android Auto/Apple AAPL CarPlay; optional third-row seats are tight; no traditional dealer network.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;A midsize electric crossover, the 2022 Tesla Model Y offers impressive range, good space, and the availability of a longer-range model with an optional third row, or a quicker 5-passenger model. Bear in mind, though, that third row is pretty tight.</p><p>Audi e-tron Sportback vs. Tesla Model Y: luxury or range?</p><p>Audi e-tron Sportback</p><p>Among Audi's increasing stable of EVs, the 2022 e-tron Sportback is the slicker, sloped-roof variant of the e-tron SUV. Its guts are the same as the regular model, although its more sporty exterior translates into a little less rear headroom and a little less cargo space than its more squared-off sibling.</p><p>Don't miss: How does this car seem to run on almost nothing? It's really quite something</p><p>Power for the e-tron comes via motors at the front and the back, and if there's one thing Audi knows, it's all-wheel drive. Even better, the e-tron has an adjustable air suspension that can be tightened for a bit more sport or softened for a comfy and smooth ride. There's an Allroad mode for winter driving, and an Off-road mode that can raise the suspension a bit for added clearance when the pavement ends.</p><p>Despite its sporty looks, the 2022 Audi e-tron Sportback doesn't fly down the road like some EVs, although its 355 horsepower and 414 pound-feet of torque (more via Boost mode) make it quick enough for most drivers.</p><p>The Sportback's range of 218 miles (4 less than the regular e-tron) is also bested by some competitors, but certainly fine for day-to-day driving. A fast charger can bring the battery back to 80% in about a half-hour.</p><p>Standard features are plentiful, with 4-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, LED lights, and Audi's Virtual Cockpit, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster that can be configured to show different information, including a map. Safety features include forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot monitoring, and lane-departure warning.</p><p>Moving up trims, the Sportback gets a Bang &amp; Olufsen BGOUF premium audio system, a top-view camera system, full leather upholstery, and massaging front seats, among other amenities. With the towing package, the 2022 e-tron Sportback can pull up to 4,000 pounds.</p><p>Tesla Model Y</p><p>The newest member of the all-electric Tesla fleet and now entering its third year, the 2022 Tesla Model Y is the baby brother to the larger Model X crossover. It offers 5- or 7-passenger seating, depending on how it's configured, and a choice of electric powertrains.</p><p>There are two big options for the Model Y, depending on what you want. The standard is the Long Range, with 447 horsepower, an optional third row of seats for 7 passengers, and 326 miles of range. The Performance model has 580 horsepower, although the range is reduced to a still-impressive 303 miles and there is no optional third row.</p><p>With plenty of power in both trims, the Model Y is quick, the dual motors delivering instant torque to all four wheels. The Performance model also adds upgraded brakes and a lowered suspension, although in either model the ride is pretty firm.</p><p>Inside, the Model Y is minimalist, with vegan simulated leather for seat upholstery and a strip of wood across the dashboard. The center of the dash is a 15-inch tablet-like infotainment screen that controls nearly everything. It can be a bit challenging to learn, and one demerit is that the Model Y does not include Apple CarPlay or Android Auto integration. In the 2-row models, the maximum cargo capacity is 68 cubic feet with all seats folded.</p><p>Standard features include a panoramic glass roof, heated front and rear seats, and automatic climate control. The center touchscreen includes navigation, and there are also a 14-speaker audio system, four USB ports, and two wireless charging pads.</p><p>Tesla's semiautonomous driver assistance system includes adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, automatic steering, and blind-spot monitoring, but still requires the driver to be attentive and ready to take control. All Tesla sales happen online, and prices are non-negotiable.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>All-wheel drive; warranty; spacious backseat.</p><p>2022 Audi e-tron Sportback advantages</p><p>Light off-road ability; federal tax credit eligibility; smoother ride; more luxurious interior.</p><p>2022 Tesla Model Y advantages</p><p>Considerably less expensive; range; MPGe; maximum cargo space; optional 7-passenger seating.</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>While it is quite a bit more expensive than its rival, the 2022 Audi e-tron Sportback is luxurious, comfortable, spacious, and can even tackle some dirt roads.</p><p>With a lower price, the 2022 Tesla Model Y goes farther on a charge, but the feel is not quite luxe. It has a stiffer ride and some quality issues, but good cargo space.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2022 Audi e-tron Sportback              2022 Tesla Model Y  Popular Powertrains  Electric Motor         141 and 172 kW AC 3-Phase               AC induction  Horsepower             355 hp                                  447 hp  Torque                 414 lb-ft                               376 lb-ft  EPA Driving Range      218 miles                               326 miles  EPA Fuel Economy       78 combined/78 city/77 hwy MPGe (est.)  125 combined/131 city/117 hwy MPGe (est.)
