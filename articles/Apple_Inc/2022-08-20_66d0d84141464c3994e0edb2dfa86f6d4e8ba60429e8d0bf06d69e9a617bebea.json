  "text": "<p>On Apple in particular, Credit Suisse raised their rating on the stock to outperform from neutral, and Cross' $201 price target assumes the shares can rise 16% from recent levels. They were changing hands north of $173 in Wednesday morning trading.</p><p>Cross finds plenty of things to like in Apple's story, including an installed base of 1.8 billion devices and a software strategy that helps give the company \"significant competitive advantages.\"</p><p>\"Management focuses on high customer satisfaction by improving ease of use, product quality, and continuity between devices â€“ resulting in high product value and repeat customer engagement,\" Cross wrote. \"By designing and building Apple software and services for Apple's custom hardware, the company produces a differentiated product portfolio with leading feature functionality.\"</p><p>She also cheered the nearly $200 billion in cash that Apple has on its balance sheet. That stash gives Apple \"ample dry powder for organic investments, shareholder return,' and continued M&amp;A,\" Cross wrote. Even though she doubts that Apple will conduct a major acquisition, she thinks that the company has been putting \"significant cash\" toward bolstering its Apple TV+ content base.</p><p>Additionally, Cross sees strong margin potential at Apple, noting that the company's higher-margin services business should continue to grow its relative size within the overall company, especially as Apple dives deeper into areas like advertising and payments.</p><p>Shares of Apple are near flat in Wednesday morning trading, though they've gained 16% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has risen about 4%.</p><p>Why Apple is among this analyst's 'top picks'</p>",
