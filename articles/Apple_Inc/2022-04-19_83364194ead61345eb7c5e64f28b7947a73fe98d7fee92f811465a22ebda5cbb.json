  "title": "China's  Lockdowns  Jeopardize  Economy  ----  By Stella Yifan Xie",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- China's severe Covid-19 restrictions, which for two years aided the country's pandemic rebound by keeping the virus outside its borders, are now emerging as the largest threat to its growth. </p><p>   Signs are growing that the economy has been cooling rapidly in recent weeks as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads across dozens of Chinese cities and prompts the harshest lockdowns since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020. </p><p>   More than two years after those initial lockdowns, \"the pandemic has to be the biggest source of risk for China's growth this year,\" said Zhennan Li, chief China economist at AllianceBernstein. </p><p>   The world's second-largest economy reported Monday that gross domestic product in the first three months of the year increased 4.8% from a year earlier, better than the previous quarter and above economists' lowered expectations. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, however, GDP growth slowed to 1.3% from the 1.6% of the previous quarter. </p><p>   The data, however, didn't fully capture the economic toll inflicted on the country by the lockdowns and other restrictions. The impact has been most severe in Shanghai, where 25 million people have been confined to their homes since late March, straining domestic logistics networks and dealing a blow to manufacturing, construction and service-sector activity. </p><p>   Across the country, more than half of China's people have been affected by Covid-19 restrictions as of mid-April, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. </p><p>   Though the GDP figures painted a relatively rosy picture for the first three months of the year, the numbers \"didn't capture the full impact from Covid restrictions,\" Mr. Li of AllianceBernstein said. </p><p>   That is partly because the data largely predated the worst of the lockdowns, which began in Shanghai days before the end of the first quarter. </p><p>   Now, as the crisis in Shanghai prompts more cities to adhere ever more stringently to Beijing's call for a zero-tolerance approach to Omicron, the resulting supply-chain disruptions risk weighing further on China's robust export machine. </p><p>   Widespread curbs on people's mobility mean that any new stimulus measures, whether it be more liquidity in the financial system or more infrastructure spending, would be less effective in the near term. </p><p>   \"Beijing now appears to prioritize controlling the pandemic above all,\" said Tommy Wu, lead China economist at Oxford Economics. \"That means local governments will likely focus on limiting infections and put aside concerns about the economy for now.\" </p><p>   China's strict curbs to stamp out Covid-19 cases through mass testing and lockdowns, now on display to varying degrees in Shanghai, Guangzhou and other major industrial hubs, are only just starting to ripple through the economy and could potentially lead to an economic contraction on a quarterly basis in the second quarter, Mr. Wu said. </p><p>   Economists from Nomura Holdings also see a rising risk of an economic pullback in the current April-to-June period compared with a year earlier. </p><p>   Sporadic lockdowns across China over the past two years have already inflicted plenty of pain on the country's small businesses, in particular those in human contact-reliant industries such as the restaurant and tourism businesses. </p><p>   Signs of stress are also rising in China's labor market. The country's headline measure of joblessness, the so-called surveyed urban unemployment rate, climbed 0.3 percentage point to a nearly two-year high of 5.8% in March, breaching the government's targeted cap of 5.5% and nearing the 5.9% level last seen in May 2020, when China was just emerging from the initial outbreak in Wuhan. </p><p>   Consumer spending, smothered since the start of the pandemic, is expected to worsen as employers cut salaries and lay off workers. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, contracted more sharply in March than economists had feared, Monday's data showed. </p><p>   Car sales will likely be significantly weaker in April than in March, with no growth expected for the full year, Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said Monday, a result of both weak consumer demand and disruptions to the auto-supply chain. </p><p>   Another potential casualty of widespread lockdowns is the export sector, a pillar of the Chinese economy. </p><p>   Coming into the year, economists had already predicted export growth to slow after two years of outperformance. </p><p>   Now, deepening supply-chain woes that prevent raw materials, inputs and labor from reaching factories and that keep finished products from reaching customers could mean that exports see no growth at all this month for the first time in nearly two years, Nomura economists have said. Chinese exports rose 15% in March compared with a year earlier. </p><p>   Manufacturers including Tesla Inc. and Pegatron Corp., a supplier to Apple Inc., have halted production due to a shortage of components -- though Tesla is among those companies aiming to resume production this week. </p><p>   Global shipping giant AP Moeller-Maersk A/S last week halted booking of refrigerated containers into Shanghai amid worsening bottlenecks caused by Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>   Rigid pandemic testing rules and lengthy quarantines imposed on truckers have sharply reduced road freight capacity. </p><p>   French bank Natixis SA has warned that supply-chain disruptions might deepen if more cities in the Yangtze River Delta, the industrial hub in and around Shanghai that accounts for 37% of China's total exports, impose similar restrictions to contain the pandemic. </p><p>   As the economic picture worsens, Chinese officials have been tepid in their efforts to respond with stimulus. </p><p>   China's central bank on Friday took the relatively modest step of reducing the amount of reserves banks must keep on hand in a bid to spur lending, though it disappointed expectations by keeping benchmark lending rates unchanged. </p><p>   After Monday's data release, investment bank ING said it would likely further reduce its full-year GDP growth forecast from the current level of 4.6% -- already well below the government's official target of about 5.5% -- as more cities enter lockdown and China's central bank remains on the sidelines. </p><p></p>",
