  "text": "<p>A majority of Apple investors on Friday voted for a civil-rights audit to examine the impact of the tech giant's policies and practices on the civil rights of employees, customers and society, as well as a proposal to investigate the company's use of concealment clauses.</p><p>Three shareholder groups&#xa0;teamed up on the civil-rights audit proposal, which representatives of the groups said was necessary because of recent internal controversies including allegations that Apple shut down an employee-run survey about pay. They also said Apple's diversity initiatives have not resulted in any significant change to the demographics of its leadership.</p><p>“This is a great victory for shareholders who clearly stated that Apple needs to be more forthcoming,” said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of SOC Investment Group, one of the shareholder groups that submitted the resolution. The others were the Service Employees International Union and Trillium Asset Management.</p><p>Apple has released information about the diversity of its workforce for years, but the proposal noted that the company has no Hispanics and only one Black person on its executive team. Waizenegger said Friday that he hopes the civil-rights audit can “conduct a real assessment on how they can increase diversity” at Apple. “A company shouldn't just say what it's doing, it needs to show it.”</p><p>According to Apple's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 53% of the votes cast approved the proposal for the civil-rights audit.</p><p>Don't miss:&#xa0;Companies declared ‘Black lives matter,' and now they're being asked to prove it</p><p>The civil-rights audit was thought to be the only shareholder proposal to pass at the meeting, but in a bit of a dramatic twist, an Apple filing Friday afternoon showed that a shareholder resolution that was announced to have failed at the morning shareholder meeting actually succeeded. The proposal, which asked for a report on the company's use of concealment clauses, passed with 50.4% of the vote after some high-profile controversy about the issue.</p><p>Cher Scarlett, the former Apple software engineer who left the company last year after saying she was harassed because she started an employee wage survey, said Friday that “this is a big sign that shareholders really want Apple to be accountable for the image it portrays and the philanthropy it does externally.”</p><p>Scarlett had contended that Apple had asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, thus limiting what she could say about her departure, but the company had told the SEC it does not use concealment clauses.</p><p>Nia Impact Capital submitted the proposal on concealment clauses. Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact, said Friday afternoon: “This is such a David and Goliath moment because [Apple] completely dismissed us and lied to us, and to the SEC… What is clear is that investors do care about these issues.”</p><p>If Apple takes action on the passage of the proposal on concealment clauses, Scarlett said it would “give shareholders and the public insight into how NDAs have been used in employee departures and whether or not they have been systemically avoiding fixing internal issues around unlawful conduct by burying any bad publicity.”</p><p>Apple did not return requests for comment Friday, but its opposition to the civil-rights audit proposal, as stated in the company's proxy, said it “already fulfills the objectives of the proposal in several ways.”</p><p>On the proposal about the concealment clauses, the company said in its proxy: “Most employees leave Apple without a separation agreement, but for situations where an agreement is appropriate, Apple has committed to incorporate substantially the following language in all U.S. separation agreements going forward: ‘Nothing in this agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.' “</p><p>Besides those two proposals, Apple shareholders submitted four other proposals asking for more transparency from the company, focusing on app removals in response to government requests; forced labor at its factories; and a report on median pay in its workforce by gender and race. There was also a proposal urging the company to become a public-benefit corporation.</p><p>Influential proxy-advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had both recommended that investors vote for the proposals on a civil-rights audit and a report on the company's use of concealment clauses. ISS also supported all the other shareholder proposals except the one about Apple becoming a public-benefit corporation, and urged voters to vote against the company proposal to ratify executive compensation, which passed.</p><p>Civil-rights audits at other giant companies, such as Starbucks Corp. SBUX, Airbnb ABNB Inc. and Facebook FB, have sparked some changes at those companies in recent years. Starbucks had faced some high-profile instances of discrimination against Black people and has since had three civil-rights audits. Airbnb hosts had been accused of bias and an audit led to changes in the company's policies. And several instances of civil-rights controversies at Facebook had prompted its third-party audit, which was highly critical of the social networking giant's practices.</p><p>See: Citi reverses course on racial-equity audit, will look at $1 billion pledge made after death of George Floyd</p><p>Last year, a couple of big banks agreed to racial-equity audits after pressure from shareholders: Citigroup Inc. C and BlackRock Inc. BLK</p><p>This proxy season, the New York State Common Retirement Fund has submitted proposals for civil-rights audits at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, where it is the shareholder group's second attempt at passing the resolution, plus Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, Match Group Inc. MTCH, Dollar General Corp. DG and Dollar Tree Inc.
