  "text": "<p>A few years ago, a clever intern told me he fancied a career in finance. I recommended he watched <em>The Big Short</em>, the Oscar-winning film. I might as well have told him to put his tongue in a Nutribullet. “There's some pretty good stuff on YouTube,” he shrugged. That's when I had doubts about the future of cinema. </p> <p>Ridley Scott has flipped to full-on despair. The director of <em>Gladiator</em> this week blamed the failure of his film <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e03ca48-9d27-443b-ad0e-aeeff6c5375b\"><em>The Last Duel</em></a> on young people's apathy about the big screen. “The audiences who are brought up on these fucking cell phones — the millennian (sic) — do not want to ever be taught anything, unless you're told it on the cell phone,” said the 83-year-old. He then blamed Facebook for giving young people “the wrong kind of confidence”.</p> <p>It's nice that Hollywood royalty are criticising people half their age, rather than dating them. But it's also hard to keep up. The charge sheet against millennials is longer than the latest Bond film. One minute millennials are blamed for frittering money on avocado toast, the next they're blamed for not frittering it on popcorn. Are the young too relaxed about coronavirus, <em>and</em> spending too little time in windowless rooms?</p> <p>Scott, who thinks the youth hang out on Facebook, is possibly not an expert. Millennials are now aged up to 40. They have children and aching knees. They — we — have our faults. But in the Sixties, Joan Didion found parents who had given a five-year-old LSD. We're not that bad. We're also not killing cinema. </p> <p>We're consuming it differently, sure. Since Scott made <em>Gladiator</em>, the average size of an LCD TV has doubled, to around 50 inches. We want films to come to us. Would you rather see a film on the train on your iPad while everyone's talking about it, or wait a month till you have a free evening for the cinema? Convenience can trump experience. Even Christopher Nolan, the <em>Dunkirk</em> director who insists the big screen is paramount, sees the possibilities of streaming. </p> <p>Cinema is just another area where the old tend to lose perspective. UK cinema attendances fell nearly 90 per cent between 1950 and 1970, and rose by a quarter between 2000 and 2019. Any chance that older generations could look at themselves before blaming us? </p> <p>Cinema remains for those special nights — and special films. “Unless people stop dating, there will always be a need for a cinema,” says Paul Lee, a partner at Deloitte. UK revenues at the Cineworld chain have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22453f49-7594-4882-ba65-625edbe70b1e\">bounced back</a> this year, thanks partly to the Bond outing <em>No Time To Die</em>. </p> <p><em>No Time To Die</em>'s makers have <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/11/no-time-to-die-losing-millions-studio-not-true-1234681095/\">denied</a> that it will lose money, due to its high costs. It would be ironic if Bond were killed by the smartphone, given the franchise's devotion to product placement. But it won't happen soon. My phone nudges me go to the cinema: I want somewhere to escape from it.</p> <p>Many films still work. Scott's <em>The Last Duel</em> just wasn't one of them. I found the only cinema in London showing it on Wednesday. (The cinema was slated for conversion into housing, but now looks to have been reprieved — sorry, flat-hunting millennials.) I paid just £7.99: Adam Driver's Latin recital and Matt Damon's mullet were worth every penny. It's a medieval #MeToo story, based on real events in 1380s France. It has long rape scenes. Who are millennials meant to take to see it? Their partners? Their parents? </p> <p>No matter, Scott has another film out: <em>House of Gucci</em>, which the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8acb4f6-5e98-44ac-b659-4fe7851b6404\">review</a> calls “not only a bad film, but a bad advert for cinema”. The irascible director will probably blame phones again. “I've never had one regret on any movie that I've ever made,” he has said. Hmm. Are millennials the ones with false confidence? Or is the customer generally right, even if they're aged under 40?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mance@ft.com\"><em>henry.mance@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Henry Mance 2021 'Stop blaming millennials for all your failures' FT.com 26 November.
