  "title": "Hong Kong Court Halts Jimmy Lai's Trial Until September 2023; An uncertain wait on a ruling from Beijing has forced a nine-month delay in the pro-democracy media tycoon's national security trial",
  "text": "<p>Beijing has accused him of helping orchestrate widespread antigovernment protests in Hong Kong in 2019, and the local authorities have pursued an aggressive legal campaign against him. On Saturday he was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for a fraud conviction over a sublease at the former headquarters of Next Media, his publishing company. He previously served 20 months in prison for participating in unauthorized protests.</p><p>He has been charged with colluding with foreign countries and the international community to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, which is banned until the national security law Beijing imposed on the city in 2020. He faces up to life in prison under the security law charges.</p><p>Mr. Lai also faces sedition charges for articles published by Apple Daily in 2019 and 2020. The newspaper closed last year after local authorities froze its assets, raided its headquarters and arrested several editors.</p><p>Mr. Lai's security law trial was set to begin on Dec. 1, but the start was delayed after the Hong Kong government sought Beijing's intervention to block a British lawyer from representing him. Hong Kong courts had ruled that British lawyer Timothy Owen could represent Mr. Lai, as part of a longstanding arrangement in the former British colony to allow lawyers with extensive common law experience to work in the city.</p><p>John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, asked for an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the highest legislative body in China, saying the city couldn't enforce secrecy requirements on overseas lawyers in security law cases, and they could be vulnerable to foreign pressure.</p><p>Beijing hasn't directly indicated whether it will take up the request and make an interpretation during the next meeting of the congress standing committee at the end of December.</p><p>Anthony Chau, a government prosecutor, asked for the trial to be rescheduled for January, citing the need for a speedy prosecution. He also raised the fate of six other defendants in the case who have pleaded guilty but won't be sentenced until Mr. Lai's trial has concluded.</p><p>Robert Pang, a lawyer for Mr. Lai, asked the Hong Kong court to postpone his trial until October, citing uncertainty over when Beijing might rule on the Hong Kong government's request to block foreign lawyers.</p><p>He also raised a series of scheduling conflicts, including the national security trial of dozens of pro-democracy politicians and activists expected to begin in February, which will involve some of the lawyers in Mr. Lai's trial. Mr. Owen is also scheduled to participate in another trial in Hong Kong beginning in May and lasting at least 100 days, Mr. Pang said.</p><p>More than 200 people have been arrested under the security law since it came into effect at the end of June 2020, and more than half of those have been prosecuted. The law carries strict limits on bail, and most of those charged remain in custody. Legal observers have said the vague provisions of the law have helped the government silence the city's once vocal political opposition, leaving many to endure long waits before they face trial.</p><p>Write to Austin Ramzy at austin.ramzy@wsj.com</p><p>Hong Kong Court Halts Jimmy Lai's Trial Until September 2023</p>",
