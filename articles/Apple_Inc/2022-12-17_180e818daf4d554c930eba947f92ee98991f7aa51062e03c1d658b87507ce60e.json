  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: Befriend A Turtle --- Iffy about turtlenecks? Five reasons to embrace 2023's most noteworthy knit.",
  "text": "<p>Putting French politics aside, we've decided to assume the role of the turtleneck's publicist. Because the thing is, this sweater makes sense right now. In the more-relaxed, post-lockdown office -- and countless other settings -- a casual but tidy turtleneck solves style problems, said Nick Paget, senior menswear strategist at trend-forecasting agency WGSN. And turtlenecks have poked their heads into every fashion category this winter, from luxe (the Row) to sporty (Uniqlo Heattech). Here, five compelling reasons to raise your neckline.</p><p>1. Turtlenecks are actually flattering</p><p>No, you don't need an elegant, giraffe-like neck to pull one off. In fact, shrouding the throat region in fabric can go a long way toward hiding sagging skin or pesky jowls. No matter your age, a high-neck style neatly frames the face, said John Wattiker, 36, a New York advertising executive and turtleneck fan. If you have a decent jawline, \"covering up the neck gives . . . [it a] prominent chisel,\" he said. \"It's slimming and really makes your face pop the way no other garment can.\"</p><p>2. They needn't be constricting</p><p>All turtlenecks are not created clingy. You'll find a sliding scale of snugness; it's up to you to decide how much room your neck needs. \"Nobody wants it to feel like they're getting an MRI or are trapped in something,\" said Ariel Foxman, 48, a turtleneck enthusiast and the general manager of WS Development's Boston Seaport project. A good tip: Start with a looser style before tightening up. Mr. Foxman suggests newbies opt for a heavyweight sweater with a neck that \"can fall open and lay off your skin.\" Variations such as funnel necks or mock necks give your Adam's apple more room to bob. If you're wary of textbook, Steve Jobs-like turtlenecks, build up your tolerance for neck-huggers before you try snugger fits in softer fibers like fine-gauge merino wool.</p><p>3. They're a fail-safe choice for the new office</p><p>With many workplaces ditching official dress codes post-lockdown, incorrectly gauging how formal or casual to go can risk embarrassment. Unsure how many shirt buttons to undo or whether to ditch that tie? In most professional settings, a turtleneck offers an easy out. \"Turtlenecks are a 'set it and forget it' kind of thing,\" said Pavit Randhawa, 42, president of Dallas startup PhoneDaddy.com, who cycles through several muted versions from Zara. \"You can wear them for Zoom calls and look professional,\" he said, or \"toss a blazer over to dress it up for in-person meetings or work dinners.\"</p><p>4. They're flexible enough to work outside the office, too</p><p>High-neck sweaters were created in the Middle Ages to protect knights' necks from chain-mail chafing. Now sporty versions are more likely to save napes from icy wind. When he ran cross-country in high school, Matt Taylor relied on turtlenecks for chilly morning sessions. Today the founder of Boston running brand Tracksmith, 45, wears his brand's waffle-knit style for cold-weather runs. And Mr. Wattiker, a committed equestrian, swears by turtlenecks for winter trots. \"They keep you just the right amount of warm.\"</p><p>Yet necky knits possess enough savoir faire for formal occasions, too. When Dan Mazzarini, a New York interior designer, attended a recent black-tie 'do, he slipped a black, larynx-grazing merino design under his tux. \"A turtleneck . . . is not strict 'black tie,'\" said Mr. Mazzarini, 42, but if you're in a creative crowd, nobody will complain. \"People appreciate that you [put] your own spin on it.\"</p><p>5. Just think of the gravitas -- and Emmanuel Macron</p><p>Los Angeles stylist Taylor Orear, who dresses a number of on-air personalities, argues that turtlenecks telegraph a confidence \"that makes someone look important,\" without appearing pompous. A high neck, he believes, makes you look like you know what you're talking about. When Mr. Orear, 35, is styling folks who need to look powerful but also appear trustworthy, he doesn't want to overdress or underdress them, he said, noting that turtlenecks achieve the right amount of formality.</p><p>For further ammunition consider French President Mr. Macron, who likes to slip dark versions under trim suits. A famously natty dresser, Mr. Macron seems well aware of the panache a high-neck knit can bring to a look. Notwithstanding his finance minister's Twitter-provoking remarks on the virtues of the style, France's leading man might well be the turtleneck's best modern ambassador.</p>",
