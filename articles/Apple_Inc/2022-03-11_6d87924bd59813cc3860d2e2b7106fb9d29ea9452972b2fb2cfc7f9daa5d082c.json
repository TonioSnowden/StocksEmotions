  "title": "Amazon Wins Few  Friends in Biden Era  ---  The tech-and-retail giant faces  a multifront battle in Washington  ----  By Dana Mattioli",
  "text": "<p>   Joe Biden's election as president seemed to herald better days in Washington for Amazon.com Inc. and for Jay Carney, its top official in the capital. </p><p>   Mr. Carney, a senior aide to Mr. Biden when he was vice president in Barack Obama's White House before joining Amazon, tweeted that \"I am so proud of my former boss\" after Mr. Biden's inauguration speech -- among dozens of laudatory posts on a Twitter account with a background photo showing Mr. Biden with his arm around Mr. Carney. </p><p>   In the months since, Amazon's relationship with the White House has been less than chummy. Mr. Biden nominated a prominent critic of the company to head the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Amazon's competitive practices. Mr. Carney has sent a series of frustrated messages to White House chief of staff Ron Klain about perceived slights against Amazon, said people familiar with the messages. </p><p>   Amazon is left facing a multifront battle with the U.S. government -- with few allies. Democratic and Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland recommending the Justice Department investigate Amazon and some of its executives for what they said was possible criminal obstruction of Congress. </p><p>   Amazon is the only one of four tech giants the committee investigated that lawmakers have accused of such behavior. \"Amazon repeatedly endeavored to thwart the Committee's efforts to uncover the truth about Amazon's business practices,\" the committee's letter said. \"For this, it must be held accountable.\" </p><p>   An Amazon spokeswoman said about the letter: \"There's no factual basis for this, as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we've provided over several years of good-faith cooperation with this investigation.\" </p><p>   Regarding Amazon's multifront battle in Washington, she said: \"We engage with policymakers to ensure they understand Amazon's contributions to the economy, including providing good jobs and benefits to our employees across the country. We also respond quickly and publicly to correct the record when false or misleading information about Amazon appears in the press or is put out by policymakers.\" </p><p>   Mr. Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, said: \"I worked for then-Vice President Biden and of course I supported him in the 2020 election. And I support him just as much today.\" </p><p>   Amazon built itself into a colossus with a bravado that it has wielded effectively against business rivals and partners. It has taken a similar approach in Washington, engendering a backlash with officials, regulators and lawmakers across both major parties. The combative strategy has also alienated many of Amazon's executives in Washington, causing departures at its D.C. offices, according to current and former Amazon public-policy employees. </p><p>   Lawmakers are proposing legislation that could reshape Amazon -- proposals the company says are misguided and would hurt consumers and sellers on its platform. The FTC is considering whether to challenge Amazon's proposed $6.5 billion acquisition of the MGM movie and television studio while continuing its broader antitrust investigation into the tech giant. </p><p>   The tenor of Amazon's approach to Washington starts with Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos. Mr. Bezos isn't outwardly political. People in his inner circle describe the billionaire as a libertarian and say he has eschewed political meet-and-greets. The Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Bezos has supported both libertarian and progressive causes. </p><p>   Amazon in 2015 hired Mr. Carney, who had joined the Obama administration on the vice president's staff before becoming White House press secretary. Amazon realized it was late to government relations, and its ever-growing empire was coming under pressure from regulators at the time of his hiring, said a person familiar with the hiring process. </p><p>   Donald Trump's 2016 election put an Amazon foe in the White House. As a candidate, Mr. Trump said Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem.\" As president, he frequently criticized Mr. Bezos and Amazon because of the then-CEO's ownership of the Washington Post. </p><p>   Amazon wasn't faring much better with its handling of relations with Congress. In June 2019, the House Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee began a bipartisan investigation into Amazon, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook (now Meta Platforms Inc.) to assess whether they had monopoly power. Over 16 months, each company produced documents and emails, made executives available to testify and answered questions about their businesses. The subcommittee asked their CEOs to testify, and the chiefs of Apple, Alphabet and Facebook agreed. </p><p>   Amazon held out, said people at Amazon and involved with the subcommittee's investigation. Amazon executives held hours of meetings on how to prevent Mr. Bezos from having to appear, said one of the people. In the end, Seattle told its Washington team to \"politely decline,\" said the person, adding that colleagues in the capital argued that was a mistake. </p><p>   In April 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that staffers on Amazon's private-label team used internal seller data to develop product ideas for its own product line, in violation of the company's stated policies. Congress sent a letter to Amazon accusing one of its lawyers of having lied to Congress in previous testimony when asked about such practices. Amazon continued to resist having Mr. Bezos testify, further aggravating the committee, said some of the people involved in the subcommittee's investigation. Amazon has maintained it didn't mislead Congress. </p><p>   When Amazon relented in June, a hearing was set for all four tech CEOs for July 27. Ten days before the planned hearing, Democratic Rep. John Lewis died. With the civil-rights leader lying in state at the Capitol rotunda, the committee asked if it could reschedule. Mr. Bezos was the only CEO to initially refuse, saying he could only meet at a different time that day instead, said some of the people involved with the investigation. Committee members viewed the resistance as arrogant, said one of the people. The hearing was later rescheduled. </p><p>   The Amazon spokeswoman said the company agreed to move the hearing, and Mr. Bezos attended virtually as did the other CEOs. </p><p>   The congressional investigation was frustrating to all the tech giants. Federal regulators have sued Google and Facebook over their competitive practices, and the suits are pending. Google and Facebook parent Meta have said that they compete fairly with other companies and that the antitrust claims against them are flawed. </p><p>   But Amazon's peers were more accommodating toward the House lawmakers, said the people involved in the investigation. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at one point met in person with subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, and at other times Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google chief Sundar Pichai each held phone calls with the Rhode Island Democrat, said some of the people. </p><p>   Mr. Bezos, who has rarely attended meetings on Capitol Hill in recent years, never personally spoke with Mr. Cicilline, the people said. Instead, Mr. Carney acted as a go-between. </p><p>   \"Amazon had the biggest middle-finger-to-Congress approach that I've ever seen with any company I've ever dealt with,\" said Garrett Ventry, former chief of staff to Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a ranking Republican member on the Antitrust Subcommittee. </p><p>   Since hiring Mr. Carney, Amazon has expanded its lobbying operations. It spent $19.3 million on lobbying firms last year -- more than any other corporation besides Facebook, which spent $20.1 million, according to data compiled by Amazon and the Center for Responsive Politics. </p><p>   Amazon also has built a sizable policy team of employees who once worked at agencies such as the FTC and Congress, many of whom have deep experience navigating the nuances of Washington relationships. But headquarters often marginalized that team's work, said several current and former employees on Amazon's public-policy team. And despite Mr. Carney's title, they said, his role in antitrust matters and government affairs was often confusing. </p><p>   Mr. Carney said he is responsible for Amazon's strategy and tone on the Hill. </p><p>   The public-policy team has a strategy called \"watering the flowers,\" said the current and former employees. An internal database tracks employee interactions with policy makers, keeping notes on meetings and talking points, to ensure that everyone important for Amazon's agenda is getting sufficient attention. </p><p>   While the D.C. team was metaphorically watering flowers, they complained of Amazon executives in Seattle \"stomping them out,\" one of the people said. Last March, for example, Amazon's public-relations account on Twitter posted a series of aggressive tweets directed at the politicians Amazon's D.C. team meets with. </p><p>   One tweet accused Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) of wanting to break Amazon up so that it would stop criticizing her. Another responded to a tweet from Rep. Mark Pocan (D., Wis.), who had criticized Amazon's treatment of employees and referred to reports that its delivery drivers sometimes urinated in bottles because they couldn't take time for breaks. The Amazon tweet dismissed his criticism: \"You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?\" Amazon later apologized for this tweet, saying it was incorrect and calling it an \"own-goal.\" </p><p>   Ms. Warren reiterated that she favors breaking up Amazon. Mr. Pocan's office didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Unlike most tweets from Amazon's news account, these tweets were crafted by executives including Mr. Bezos and Mr. Carney, said people at Amazon. Mr. Carney declined to comment on the tone of the tweets. Vox previously reported Mr. Bezos' involvement in the tweets. </p><p></p>",
