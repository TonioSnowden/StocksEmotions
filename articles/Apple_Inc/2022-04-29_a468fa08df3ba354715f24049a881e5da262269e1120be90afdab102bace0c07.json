  "title": "Tech Rout Gives Nasdaq Its Worst Month Since 2008; The tech-heavy index slid more than 4% Friday, bringing its losses for the month to 13%",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq dropped 4.2% Friday, bringing its losses for the month to more than 13%, its worst showing since October 2008. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen for four consecutive weeks to shed 8.8% in April, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen around 4.9% this month. Both logged their worst months since March 2020.</p><p>The broad stock-market gauge is off to its worst start to a year since 1939, while the Nasdaq has had its poorest showing to kick off a year on record.</p><p>The punishing declines in tech and growth stocks mark a dramatic shift from recent years. Throughout the month, investors ditched shares of some of the biggest tech companies, which had been stock-market darlings for much of the past decade and led the market higher from its March 2020 lows. Within just a few months, some of the most reliable winners of the past few years have morphed into losers.</p><p>Worries about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, soaring inflation and the path of the economy have brought stocks sharply lower from the records they kicked off the year with. Many pandemic-era winners have also come falling back to earth as consumer tastes have evolved since 2020. And recently, earnings season has been dotted with some high-profile disappointments from the group, delivering head-spinning moves after the reports.</p><p>\"We're going into a higher volatility regime, when fundamentals matter again,\" said Aashish Vyas, investment director at Resonanz Capital. \"It does seem like we are at a systemic shift.\"</p><p>The FAANG stocks, consisting of the popular quintet of Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, have collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market value this month, the most since Facebook started trading in May 2012.</p><p>Some individual tech stocks, such as Netflix and Nvidia, were recently headed toward their worst month in at least a decade.</p><p>Investors say they will be tracking the next batch of earnings results in coming days for signs of slowing growth from other companies. So far, corporate profits are on track to rise 7% for the quarter, according to FactSet, the lowest year-over-year earnings growth rate since the last quarter of 2020.</p><p>There have been some high-profile disappointments.</p><p>Amazon shares fell 14%, the biggest one-day drop since at least 2014 and bringing its losses for the year to 26%. The company posted its first quarterly loss in seven yearsâ€”a result that reflected broad economic trends related to a slump in online shopping, higher costs from inflation and supply-chain woes, and market jitters over electric-vehicle startups.</p><p>Apple cautioned Thursday that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China threatens to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion in the current quarter. Shares were down 3.7% and have lost 11% for the year. Last week, Netflix shares recently tumbled more than 30% after the earnings report showed the company lost subscribers. Moves in large technology companies can have outsize impacts on major stock indexes due to their higher weighting relative to other stocks.</p><p>Also driving the volatility? Yields on traditionally safe government debt have rapidly darted higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.885% to end April, notching its biggest monthly gain since December 2009. These higher yields have dented the allure of tech and growth stocks, making shares of firms whose profits may lie further out in time less attractive.</p><p>For much of the month, many traders and market watchers have remained fixated on another matter: The drama surrounding Twitter, as Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk took a stake in the company and then reached a deal to buy it. The tweets and negotiations throughout the process spurred intense volatility in shares of both companies. Twitter shares jumped 27% this month, while Tesla shares have shed 19%.</p><p>Many investors have grown more concerned about a recession, driving swings across global markets. The war in Ukraine has driven commodity prices higher when inflation has already been at a 40-year high. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a path to raise interest rates, but it faces an especially tricky path to tame inflation while not substantially raising unemployment.</p><p>\"There's this massive escalation of recession fears,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. But, he said \"I think there's a lot more fear there than is probably necessary.\"</p><p>The latest gross domestic product data showed that the economy recently contracted for the first time since early in the pandemic. Meanwhile, inflation accelerated in March to its fastest pace since 1982, measured by the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge.</p><p>Still, despite higher prices, U.S. consumer spending for March increased 1.1% from the prior month, showing that American households are absorbing high inflation.</p><p>Some investors said that shares of some tech companies looked attractive after the recent selloff, and they would consider stepping in to buy shares after the steep drop. The Nasdaq is now down 23% from its high and trading at levels not seen since 2020. More than a year of gains have been wiped off the index.</p><p>On Friday, losses in major indexes accelerated into the closing bell, which some traders attributed to technical factors such as hedging activity and trading by leveraged exchange-traded products.</p><p>The Dow sank 939.18 points, or 2.8%, to 32977.21. The S&amp;P declined 3.6% to 4131.93.</p><p>The giant swings haven't been contained to just tech stocks. Investors around the globe have been alarmed by the dramatic moves in assets from currencies to bonds.</p><p>In currency markets, the dollar has been soaring while the yen has been crashing. The yen, a typical safehaven for investors around the globe, has been tumbling to a 20-year-low against the dollar, upending the typical dynamics across global markets and stirring unease among investors.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index has strengthened this year in anticipation of Fed rate increases, which are expected to happen faster and more aggressively than in the eurozone and Japan.</p><p>Investors were more eager to buy shares of tech companies in Asia.Shares of Alibaba Group and other Chinese technology companies jumped by double-digit percentages, leading a broader market rally. Investors piled into the sector on hopes that the government would support the sector and economy.</p><p>The Hang Seng Tech Index surged 10%, with shares in Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, JD.com and Meituan all rising.</p><p>The surge helped Chinese shares recoup some of their recent losses.</p><p>Write to Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com.</p><p>Tech Rout Gives Nasdaq Its Worst Month Since 2008</p>",
