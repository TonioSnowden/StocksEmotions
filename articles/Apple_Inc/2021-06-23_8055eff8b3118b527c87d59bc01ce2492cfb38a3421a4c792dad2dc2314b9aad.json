He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab87a2b7-c007-479c-9be2-4d470e424bea\">describes a “relational” universe</a> in which there are no absolutes and everything depends on interactions between objects. You won't understand quantum mechanics after reading this — or any other book — but you'll have fun trying.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1398502316?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1398502316\"><strong>The Code Breaker</strong></a><strong>: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race</strong><br>by Walter Isaacson, <em>Simon &amp; Schuster £30</em></p> <p>Isaacson follows up his well received biographies of Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98658737-b70d-466a-8920-78b9243ccf07\">contemporary story of Crispr and gene editing</a> — the most significant biomedical advance of the past decade. The heroine of this well-told tale is Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, though other scientists who played key roles in the development of Crispr get a look-in too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241512476?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0241512476\"><strong>The Premonition</strong></a><strong>: A Pandemic Story</strong><br>by Michael Lewis, <em>Allen Lane £25/WW Norton &amp; Company $30</em></p> <p>Lewis, author of <em>Liar's Poker</em> and <em>The Big Short</em>, has another deserved bestseller with <em>The Premonition</em>. This book is only partly about the current pandemic — Covid-19 does not appear till halfway through — but tells the story of a loose-knit band of individuals fighting to overcome appalling failings in the US public health system and improve its response to infectious disease.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1982165332/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1982165332&amp;linkId=4a51ecfabf39ae3f9382b632e5f706de\"><strong>The Plague Cycle</strong></a><strong>: The Unending War Between Humanity and Infectious Disease</strong><br>by Charles Kenny, <em>Simon &amp; Schuster £20</em></p> <p>Kenny's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7162efc2-750b-4b88-abfd-143be3e218fd\">sweeping history of human infections</a> shows that there is nothing new about people trying to protect themselves against transmissible diseases through masks, quarantines and social distancing — or in demonising groups believed responsible for spreading illness. The book stands out for its vivid examples and lively writing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/024138186X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=024138186X\"><strong>Connections</strong></a><strong>: A Story of Human Feeling</strong><br>by Karl Deisseroth, <em>Viking £20</em></p> <p>Psychiatry professor Deisseroth examines mental illness by interweaving cutting-edge neuroscience with the often moving stories of patients and his personal responses to them. He could not be better qualified for the task, as both a developer of new technology to discover what is happening in the brain and a physician treating people with severe psychological disorders.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Clive Cookson 2021 'Summer books of 2021: Science' FT.com 23 June.
