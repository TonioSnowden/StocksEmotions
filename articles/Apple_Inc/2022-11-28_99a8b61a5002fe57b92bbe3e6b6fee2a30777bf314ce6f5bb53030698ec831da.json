  "title": "Elon Musk Claims Apple Is Threatening to Remove Twitter From App Store; Twitter boss attacks iPhone maker and CEO Tim Cook over advertising and censorship",
  "text": "<p>\"Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why,\" Mr. Musk said Monday. In</p><p>another tweet, he asked: \"Who else has Apple censored?\"</p><p>Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Twitter has been facing a wave of departures by advertisers since Mr. Musk bought the company last month. After initially pausing spending on the platform, many have begun shifting their digital ad spending to other corners of the internet, such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Mr. Musk recently said he wasn't sure how much financial runway Twitter still had and that bankruptcy wasn't out of the question.</p><p>Apple is one of the biggest advertisers on Twitter, spending an estimated $39 million to advertise on Twitter during the first 10 months of this year, which is mostly before Mr. Musk's takeover, according to the latest data available from ad-tracking company MediaRadar Inc.</p><p>Tensions between Mr. Musk, who runs Tesla Inc. and other companies in addition to Twitter, and Apple, the world's largest corporation by market value, have existed for years and have escalated since the billionaire took over the social-media company.</p><p>Last week Apple executive Phil Schiller, who oversees the company's App Store, deactivated his Twitter account, which he had used to promote Apple products. Also last week Mr. Musk said he would make his own smartphone if Apple and Google were to boot Twitter from their app stores.</p><p>\"I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,\" he tweeted.</p><p>Apple has strict policies regarding user-generated content on apps in the App Store. The company last year removed social-media apps Parler and Wimkin in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Apple told Parler it received complaints regarding objectionable content on the service and accusations the app was used to plan, coordinate and facilitate illegal activities, according to a notice provided to the Journal at the time by Parler's then-chief executive. Parler has since returned to the App Store after changing some of its content-moderation practices.</p><p>Google also temporarily removed Parler and Wimkin from its app store in response to the kind of content their users posted around when the riot took place. Both apps have since been restored on Google's store.</p><p>Mr. Musk's relationship with Apple was fraught even before he took over Twitter.</p><p>Mr. Musk turned to Mr. Cook around 2018 in a Hail Mary effort to find funding to keep Tesla afloat as it struggled with its Model 3 production.</p><p>Mr. Cook has said he has never spoken to Mr. Musk.</p><p>Tesla had become a recruiting ground for Apple as the tech giant explored its own car ambitions. Mr. Musk complained in a 2015 Bloomberg Businessweek article about Apple's attempts to poach his engineers. And he has lambasted the bigger company, saying in the German newspaper Handelsblatt that Apple hired those who couldn't handle working at Tesla. \"We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard,'\" he was quoted saying in 2015.</p><p>His barbs seemed to become sharper in 2021 as Apple faced a legal battle with \"Fortnite\" developer Epic Games Inc. over the control the iPhone maker maintains with its devices and its more than one billion users.</p><p>Epic has accused Apple of holding an improper monopoly over the distribution of third-party apps onto the iPhone and forcing those software companies to use its in-app payment system. Epic has called Apple's 30% take unfair.</p><p>Apple has defended its business, saying the fees are in line with the industry norm and fair for the technology it provides. It mostly won a lawsuit by Epic though the two are continuing to fight in an appeals court.</p><p>Mr. Musk waded into the matter last year, before his interest to own Twitter was clear. He called Apple's fees \"a 30% tax on the internet\" in a tweet in May. \"Literally 10 times higher than it should be.\" In July, he said the fees \"are a de facto global tax on the Internet.\"</p><p>This month, Apple and Epic took the battle before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department also weighed in on the case, contending earlier this year that the district court ruling erred in its interpretation of U.S. antitrust law and warned that the ruling set a precedent for anticompetitive agreements.</p><p>A number of other software developers, including Spotify Technology SA, have sharply criticized how Apple manages its App Store and have pushed for governments around the world to force the company to loosen its controls on software distribution. New legislation in the European Union could force Apple to allow users to access app stores operated by third parties and permit them to download apps outside of its app store. The legislation is set to take effect next year.</p><p>Mr. Musk reiterated his criticism of Apple's software fees on Monday, tweeting \"Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?\"</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
