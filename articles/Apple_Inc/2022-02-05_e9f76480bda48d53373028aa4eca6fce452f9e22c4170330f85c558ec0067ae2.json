  "text": "<p>\n  SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY SA </p><p>\n  SPOT -17% </p><p>\n  The static at Spotify is getting louder. The music streaming giant on Wednesday said it gained users in the recent quarter but declined to issue annual guidance amid controversy sparked by musician Neil Young, who pulled his music in protest of what he said was vaccine misinformation spread by podcaster Joe Rogan. Mr. Rogan spoke against vaccine mandates for indoor events and suggested young, healthy people shouldn't be vaccinated. Chief Executive Daniel Ek said it was too early to tell if the controversy had an impact on subscribers. Spotify shares sank 17% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  EXXON MOBIL CORP. </p><p>\n  XOM +6.4% </p><p>\n  High oil and gas prices fueled a rebound for Exxon. The oil giant on Tuesday reported $23 billion in profit for 2021, its highest total since 2014, including $8.9 billion in profit in the fourth quarter. Large Western energy companies are luring back investors as they predict a multiyear upswing for the oil and gas industry. The firms benefit from rapidly rising commodity prices, as demand for some fuels tops pre-pandemic levels. Many of the companies say they will stick to pledges to moderate their growth and return more cash to shareholders. Exxon shares gained 6.4% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  META PLATFORMS INC. </p><p>\n  FB -26% </p><p>\n  Shares in several big technology companies struggled Thursday as doubts mounted about a tech boom that powered the U.S. stock market during the pandemic and bolstered the economy. Facebook parent Meta Platforms reported a sharp decline in profit and said it lost about a million daily users globally. Its shares plummeted 26% Thursday. But Amazon.com Inc. shares surged after its profit nearly doubled in the holiday period. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC. </p><p>\n  UPS +14% </p><p>\n  UPS shipped fewer parcels, but delivered better results. The company on Tuesday boosted its quarterly dividend by 49% as fourth-quarter profit and revenue surged. While UPS transported fewer packages on its trucks and planes than it did a year ago, the firm is making more money per piece. This reflects Chief Executive Carol Tome's stated strategy of \"better, not bigger\" -- focusing on shipping more packages for its more profitable customers, and jettisoning some shipping volume where it wasn't making as much money. UPS shares closed up 14% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS INC. </p><p>\n  AMC +5% </p><p>\n  Spider-Man helped save the day in AMC's latest quarter. The movie-theater chain posted preliminary results Tuesday that showed better-than-expected revenue in the most recent period. While the Omicron variant likely kept some moviegoers at home, AMC benefitted from splashy releases of new movies such as \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" which topped $1 billion at the box office in the two weeks following its Dec. 17 release. Chief Executive Adam Aron said the quarterly results will be the company's strongest since before the Covid-19 pandemic. AMC shares added 5% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  STARBUCKS CORP. </p><p>\n  SBUX -1% </p><p>\n  Holiday demand wasn't enough of a jolt for Starbucks sales. The coffee chain on Tuesday said that while holiday sales helped boost its business in its most recent quarter, sales weakened in the latter part of the period during the Omicron surge. Some locations have moved to takeout only or shortened operating hours as the variant spread. Starbucks also said rising costs of supplies and wages will continue to weigh on profits. The company spent more on Covid-19 isolation pay for workers and on training as it hired more employees. Starbucks shares fell 1% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  SNAP INC. </p><p>\n  SNAP +59% </p><p>\n  Snap snapped back. Its shares fell Thursday amid a broader pullback of social-media companies but recovered after Snap posted its first quarterly profit and a 20% year-over-year increase in daily active users for the Snapchat app popular with teens and young adults. Snap also signaled it is adjusting to Apple Inc. privacy policy changes that disrupted the digital advertising market; its finance chief said elements of the company's ad business \"began to recover\" from those changes \"quicker than we anticipated.\" Snap shares surged 59% Friday. </p><p></p>",
