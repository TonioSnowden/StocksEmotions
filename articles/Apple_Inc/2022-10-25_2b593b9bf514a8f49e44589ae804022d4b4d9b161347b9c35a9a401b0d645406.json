  "text": "<p>\n   \"Should I get an iPad or a Mac?\" People often ask me this question and, with the latest iPad software update, the answer is a bit complicated. </p><p>\n   Apple has added more laptop-like productivity features to the iPad over the past several years, such as mouse support and a file manager. There's even more in iPadOS 16, which became available Monday. The most visible change is a multitasking system called Stage Manager, which lets you resize app windows and simultaneously view more windows on screen. </p><p>\n  There's a catch, though. There are limitations to how you can display and resize the windows. And the new iPad software is compatible with some older models, but many of the best features are reserved for newer, pricier iPads. </p><p>\n  With iPadOS 16, it's clear that Apple now has two classes of tablets: The Pros and the M1 Air get more advanced features, while Minis and basic iPads -- even the newest ones -- are stuck with a traditional iPad experience. </p><p>\n  I've been using the public beta version of the software for a few weeks. As a longtime iPad worker, I had high expectations for iPadOS 16. Stage Manager won't convince Mac die-hards that an iPad can replace their laptop. But for people who already work on iPads, the new system is an improvement. And better support for external monitors, which Apple has unveiled but isn't yet rolling out, could unlock even more productivity. </p><p>\n  These models can download the update: All iPad Pro models, iPad Air (3rd generation or later), iPad Mini (5th generation or later) and iPad (5th generation or later). If you're unsure of your model, check Settings &gt; General &gt; About. You can look for the update in Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. </p><p>\n  No, there's still no Calculator app like the iPhone's, but there is finally a fancy new Weather app. The new iPadOS also brings a handwriting straightener to fix droopy penmanship and the ability to hand off a FaceTime call from the iPad to an iPhone. </p><p>\n  Many iOS 16 updates are on the iPad -- hallelujah, editable messages! -- but lock-screen widgets, the best new feature, are only on iPhones. And you still can't get multiple user profiles, which would help if you share your iPad with your kids, for instance. </p><p>\n  If you've got a high-end iPad, there's a lot more to get used to with this upgrade. Here are a couple of the highlights: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Open multiple, resizable windows. Before iPadOS 16, you could view only two apps side by side -- with a third floating on top. Now, Stage Manager allows you to view four apps simultaneously. </p><p>\n  It's only available for the newest iPad Air and for the iPad Pro models with Face ID and the newer no-home-button design. </p><p>\n  Enable Stage Manager in Settings &gt; Home Screen &amp; Multitasking. Eligible iPads also have a Stage Manager icon in the Control Center. (Swipe down from the top right corner.) </p><p>\n  Now you can start adding windows to your workspace. If you have a docked or Bluetooth keyboard, use the search keyboard shortcut (Command + Space) to find the app you want. Once its icon appears, drag it to your screen and the app will open as a window. </p><p>\n  Also, some apps let you open more than one window. You can view multiple Safari websites side by side, for example, but only one Google Docs page at a time. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Use the side dock to store different workspaces. When Stage Manager is enabled, there's a new side dock. On the left side of the screen, swipe right or move your cursor to that side to expand the dock. This is where you can store different groups of windows. You can also add windows to your current workspace by dragging them from your side dock. </p><p></p>",
