  "title": "EU to Open San Francisco Office Focused on Tech Regulation; New office will work with companies regulated by European Union rules",
  "text": "<p>The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, which was created last year to work out differences over trade and technology policy, took on new significance after Russia invaded Ukraine in February and spurred U.S. and European officials to look for ways to counter the influence of authoritarian countries, according to officials involved. Authorities announced a plan for joint EU-U.S. development funding of cybersecurity infrastructure in developing countries as part of the council discussions.</p><p>\"There's a mutual interest in cooperating very closely,\" said Gerard de Graaf, who will head the new office. Mr. de Graaf, a senior European Commission official who oversaw landmark tech legislation on illegal social-media content and tech platforms' anticompetitive behavior that was passed this month, said the U.S. and EU are working on similar rules for other tech areas, such as the semiconductor industry.</p><p>The Digital Services Act, approved this month, requires social-media companies to adopt measures to deal with illegal content and sets out procedures for applying terms fairly to do so without spelling out what content must be taken down. Separately, the Digital Markets Act, which was approved at the same time as the social-media rules, deals with anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>Beyond the work with tech companies, Mr. de Graaf said he would build relationships with state lawmakers, academics and venture-capital firms in the area. Lobbyists in Brussels for large American tech firms have criticized what they see as protectionist restrictions in EU regulations. U.S. cloud companies could be excluded from hosting certain sensitive data under coming European guidelines, for example.</p><p>\"There's this emphasis in Europe on tech regulation. That's where Europe wants to stand out and be a leader,\" said Christian Borggreen, vice president and head of the Brussels office for the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, whose members include Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. \"The U.S. is a leader in tech innovation. Both have things to learn,\" he said.</p><p>The European Commission is preparing new legislation on cybersecurity that is expected to establish common rules to secure digital products.</p><p>A central part of Mr. de Graaf's work in San Francisco will be meeting with companies that must comply with EU tech rules because they do business in the 27-nation bloc. Big tech companies often bring more than a dozen lawyers to meetings, and Mr. de Graaf said he could help ensure companies adopt a more strategic approach to EU laws and not one that is driven by lawyers alone. Still, he expects companies to file lawsuits against coming tech legislation. \"A relationship between the regulator and the regulated is always a bit complicated. A regulator is always like a bit of a policeman,\" he said.</p><p>Soon after starting work in San Francisco, Mr. de Graaf said he would visit Sacramento to meet with lawmakers in the state capital to explain EU tech policies and understand state rules. \"California has often been a trailblazer in the U.S. It's difficult to get anything passed in Washington, D.C.,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Catherine Stupp at Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com</p>",
