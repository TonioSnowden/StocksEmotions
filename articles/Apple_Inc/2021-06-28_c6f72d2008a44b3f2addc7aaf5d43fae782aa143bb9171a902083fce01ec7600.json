  "text": "<p>All the UK's music festivals have faced challenges from the pandemic, the Grange Festival in Hampshire more than most. Its plan to change its dates to take advantage of the expected opening-up of the economy on June 21 came unstuck when the date was postponed, and it must be a huge relief that the festival has qualified for the government's events research programme, with 100 per cent attendance allowed from July 1.</p> <p>That was not all. The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra felt unable to play in the theatre's less-than-socially-distanced small pit. Time to give up? The UK's summer opera festivals have shown their fighting spirit and the Grange is no exception. When the curtain rose on opening night for Britten's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, appropriately on midsummer's night, it must have felt as if they had slain a cohort of dragons.</p> <p>The biggest surprise is the Grange's answer to the missing orchestra. Cutting-edge technology was chosen to “play the full orchestral score digitally live”, and anybody who was unaware there was no orchestra sitting in the pit would be hard pushed to guess. Conductor Anthony Kraus keeps co-ordination skilfully on track.</p> <p>The production is more of a problem. It looks good, set among the ruins of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, but director Paul Curran has pepped up the action with an exhausting cornucopia of high jinks, and the comedy is laid on with a trowel.</p> <p>A very decent cast of singers could have achieved more with less. Alexander Chance and Samantha Clarke glitter as supernatural Oberon and Tytania. Eleanor Dennis's Helena and Angela Simkin's Hermia squabble with rollicking bitchiness. Henry Waddington sings a sonorous Bottom and Chris Darmanin hurtles round the stage as an athletic Puck. This is a show with too much life rather than too little. Rossini's <em>La&#xa0;Cenerentola</em> and Puccini's <em>Manon Lescaut</em> are the season's other operas.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Boston Lyric Opera's eight-part operatic mini-series <em>desert in</em> has reached its long-anticipated climax. Even online, where some unusual projects have been spawned in the past year, a supernatural mystery video series is a first for opera.</p> <p>The plot centres on a mysterious hotel in the desert, where guests check in to make contact with former loves. These encounters toy with dividing lines, like past and present, dead and alive, male and female (couplings of every kind in tribute to LGBT+ Pride month).&#xa0;</p> <p>The opera has gained in focus and direction as it has gone along. Having eight different composers was a risk, but Ellen Reid, one of the project's masterminds, has drawn consistently atmospheric scores from her collaborators, including Vijay Iyer and Nico Muhly, and the filming holds to an arty style of its own.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are mysteries aplenty. Why do memories surface after a swim in the pool? Will Ion be able to free the guests? No spoilers here. There is still time to check in to the desert inn. The eight films, each lasting about 15 minutes, are on Boston Lyric Opera's streaming site, operabox.tv, and via platforms including Apple and Google throughout the year. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>To July 2, </em><a href=\"https://thegrangefestival.co.uk/\"><em>thegrangefestival.co.uk</em></a><em><br>‘desert in' now streaming on </em><a href=\"https://www.operabox.tv/\"><em>operabox.tv</em></a></p><p>Source: Richard Fairman 2021 'Grange Festival keeps Dream alive with fighting spirit' FT.com 28 June.
