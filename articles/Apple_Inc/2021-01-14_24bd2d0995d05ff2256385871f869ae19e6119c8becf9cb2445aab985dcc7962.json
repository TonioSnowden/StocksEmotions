  "text": "<p>The incoming chair of the BBC said the broadcaster risks becoming a mouse that will be crushed by the “elephants” of the global media industry unless it shrewdly marshals its resources for a digital age.</p> <p>The warning from Richard Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs partner, about the challenge of global competition to public broadcasting came in a relatively measured and diplomatic hearing before MPs vetting his appointment on Thursday.&#xa0;</p> <p>“If you stood back and realised the power of Tencent, Baidu, Apple and Amazon and looked at the BBC on its own, you would say it is severely challenged and threatened,” Mr Sharp told parliament's digital, culture, media and sport committee.</p> <p>“There is a saying that when the elephants start dancing the mice should get off the floor. Well, we have to ensure that the BBC is in a position to take on the elephants.”</p> <p>Mr Sharp's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab426971-e904-49b8-acc4-dd75dba50305\">appointment </a>has been greeted with a sense of relief within the top ranks of the BBC, who last year feared Boris Johnson's government was on the brink of appointing an arch critic to overhaul the broadcaster.</p> <p>Expressing concerns that he might bring a politicised or free-market agenda to the BBC, several MPs pressed Mr Sharp on his ties to the chancellor Rishi Sunak, who he once managed at Goldman and advised at the Treasury, and his £400,000 in donations to the Conservative party.&#xa0;</p> <p>But on some of the most contentious issues regarding the BBC's future and editorial balance, Mr Sharp barely diverged from the public broadcaster's longstanding house view and the priorities of its new director-general Tim Davie.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mr Sharp notably backed the licence fee as the “least worst” option for collecting the BBC's £3.7bn in annual public funding, opposed decriminalisation of non-payment of the £157.50 charge and rejected suggestions of BBC bias during the Brexit referendum.</p> <p>“Meet the new boss, same as the old boss,” said Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the committee. </p> <p>Although the DCMS committee will vote on Mr Sharp's standing as a candidate to replace the outgoing chair David Clementi, its advice is non-binding. During the hearing, MPs from a range of parties said they assumed he would be appointed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Like Mr Davie, Mr Sharp stressed the importance of protecting and reinforcing the BBC's impartiality in news coverage, saying it could not be defensive and needed to rigorously hold itself to account.&#xa0;</p> <p>While holding back on making specific pledges, he said he would make a priority of pushing to improve internal processes at the corporation, tackling unwieldy management structures that hamper editorial oversight and allowed a big <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/105573b3-dec4-4318-9dc0-7f8f60a76f5d\">gender pay gap</a> to emerge.</p> <p>While he acknowledged the weaknesses of the licence fee, Mr Sharp noted for “a regressive tax” it still commanded remarkable support with the public. “At 43p a day the BBC poses terrific value,” he said. </p> <p>Echoing the views of BBC executives, he expressed openness to exploring other funding models when the licence fee is next reviewed in 2027, mentioning the household tax in Germany.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some of his most outspoken remarks addressed the competition posed by social media and tech platforms, and the need for BBC to position itself for streaming wars —&#xa0;a momentous “battle for wallets and for time” that was still in its early stages.&#xa0;</p> <p>He noted the BBC's low profile on platforms such as TikTok, while expressing reservations about the corporation using YouTube to drive commercial revenue from advertising.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The concentration of BBC content in the iPlayer is of paramount importance,” he said. “To commercially atomise itself — I suspect that is doubtful.”</p><p>Source: Alex Barker in London 2021 'New BBC chair ready for fight with streaming rivals' FT.com 14 January.
