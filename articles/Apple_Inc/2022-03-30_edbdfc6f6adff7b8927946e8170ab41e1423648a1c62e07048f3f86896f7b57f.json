  "text": "<p>The German government has taken <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0706d6f4-6668-4f67-ab1c-d535d847caf7\">the first formal step towards gas rationing</a> as it braces itself for a potential halt in deliveries from Russia due to a dispute over payments.</p> <p>Germany is one of the biggest purchases in Europe of Russian pipeline gas but is trying to drastically reduce the imports. Last week, the government in Berlin vowed to all but wean itself off Russia's gas by mid-2024 and become “virtually independent” of its oil by the end of this year. </p> <p>The US president Joe Biden vowed to help Europe cut its dependence on Russian energy after a summit in Brussels last week by redirecting at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de704c90-dc68-4747-86ef-551f1ffbcb04\">least 15bn cubic metres</a> of additional liquefied natural gas to the EU. </p> <p>The decision by Germany to prepare for gas rationing is the latest in a growing dispute that has raised the prospect of Russian gas supplies to Europe halting. Russian officials said yesterday they were not prepared to “supply gas for free” to Europe, a day after G7 countries unanimously rejected President Vladimir Putin's directive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75fe861a-65bc-4248-9da5-9b5a88897a50\">requiring rouble payments</a>.</p> <p>Volker Wieland, a professor of economics at Frankfurt University and a member of the German council of economic advisers, warned that a halt in Russian energy supplies would create a “substantial” risk of a recession and bring Europe's largest economy “close to double-digit rates of inflation”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Europe's wholesale gas price rose 8 per cent to €114.45 a megawatt hour today in early trading.</p> <h1>More on the war in Ukraine:</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Peace talks:</strong> Russia's announcement that it would scale back its military activities near Kyiv <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04870911-7a4d-454d-abdc-083059c1cc72\">were met with scepticism</a> by Volodymyr Zelensky and western leaders. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Military: </strong>For almost three decades Russia's military has supplied China with missiles, helicopters and advanced fighter jets.
