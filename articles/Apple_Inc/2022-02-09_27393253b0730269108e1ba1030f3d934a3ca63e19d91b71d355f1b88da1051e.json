  "title": "It Isn't 'Downton Abbey,' but It Is the Perfect Home for Them; The actress who played Lavinia Swire on the hit British TV series and her cinematographer husband embarked on a project to merge two apartments just as the pandemic hit",
  "text": "<p>\"Our plan was to be boots on the ground by March 2020 and be finished by Christmas,\" said Mr. Spence, 40.</p><p>The couple chose the house because, although it had shortcomings, it also had great potential. The couple married in summer 2019 and they wanted to swap the warehouse apartment they were renting for a more permanent home. Mr. Spence had two particular priorities for their new place: He wanted to live in the east London borough of Hackney, where he was raised, and he wanted a spacious house. \"We wanted something open plan, but with the flavor of an old London house,\" he said.</p><p>For her part, Ms. Boyle, 37, who played Lavinia Swire on the TV series \"Downton Abbey\" and Trinity Ashby on \"Sons of Anarchy,\" was happy to take on a project house rather than pay a premium for a home renovated to someone else's tastes. \"I grew up with my parents always renovating houses, and although it could be a bit chaotic, it was something I was used to,\" she said.</p><p>Their house, when they found it, had actually been split into two properties. One was a gloomy, dark and damp one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment on the basement level. The other was a four-bedroom, one-bathroom house on the three upper floors. Altogether, the property measured around 2,100 square feet, which ticked one of Mr. Spence's boxes. \"And the upper floors had classic Victorian proportions with high ceilings and big windows and some original features,\" he added. \"We could see the potential.\"</p><p>Eager to get started, the couple hired Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects to help them draw up plans to reunite the house and apartment. They secured building permits and found a contractor.</p><p>Then came the pandemic.</p><p>Britain went into its first national lockdown at the end of March 2020, and the couple were forced to put their plans on pause. \"It was a difficult time for everybody, we were paying rent and mortgage, and at the time it felt like the world was ending,\" said Mr. Spence.</p><p>The couple spent that initial lockdown fine-tuning their plans for the house but it wasn't until August 2020 that they were finally able to start the work. Initially, they planned to spend around $680,000 on consolidating and upgrading the two properties but, with the economic uncertainties wrought by the pandemic on their minds, they decided to drop plans to convert the attic into an en-suite bedroom. This, they hoped, would cut their total bill back to $584,000.</p><p>Extra costs kept cropping up. They ended up spending about $653,000. Unforeseen expenses included treating damp in the basement, tackling an outbreak of black mold in the attic, and repairs required to the roof. \"Even things we thought would be easy turned out to be really expensive,\" said Ms. Boyle. \"The worst was that we had two gas meters, one for the flat and one for the house, and we had to have one removed and one moved.</p><p>\"We thought it wouldn't be very difficult, but it ended up costing £8,000 [$10,860], and we are still dealing with the administration because it turned out they took out the wrong meter,\" she said.</p><p>Unifying the house with the basement extension meant installing a new timber staircase. They also created a large, open-plan kitchen and living room with sliding glass doors leading out to the backyard. A new skylight throws more light into the room, while its exposed timber joists and timber floors add natural texture.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think of this renovation and its mixture of historic architecture and bright colors?</p><p>The house needed a lot of basic maintenance including full rewiring, and the replacement of its aged sash windows with double-glazed versions. The small kitchen, which had serviced the main house, was repurposed as a guest bathroom.</p><p>They also redecorated the whole house, including a large living room on the first floor, the principal bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the second floor, and an office, guest bedroom, and a third bedroom now used as a gym on the third floor.</p><p>Agreeing on a color scheme was a particular challenge for this couple, since Mr. Spence likes clean, white lines and plenty of light, and Ms. Boyle is a fan of rich, deep, and unexpected colors. The solution, suggested by their architects, was to use blocks of color against a white backdrop. The white kitchen has cabinets painted an intense plum and the interiors of the enclosed staircase linking the basement to the upper house is sky blue. \"They are all heritage colors which are based in nature, so it doesn't feel too clown-like or carnivally,\" said Ms. Boyle. </p><p>Zoe Boyle and Benedict Spence in their colorful kitchen.

Ms. Boyle's love of color is given free rein in the primary bedroom, with its anthracite walls and ceiling, rich orange carpet, and blue velvet bed. The en-suite bathroom, meanwhile, is apple green.</p><p>Three months behind on their schedule, in March 2021, the couple were finally able to move into their house. \"Being here during the lockdowns, and having so much space, was great,\" said Ms. Boyle. \"Even though it is quite a big house, more than half of it is living space rather than sleeping space and we really do use every single room.\"</p><p>BALANCE SHEET</p><p>· Demolition and structural work: $108,600</p><p>· External finishes: $27,000</p><p>· Windows, doors, roof light: $84,200</p><p>· Decorating, floors: $88,200</p><p>· Joinery: $47,500</p><p>· New stairs: $17,650</p><p>· Plumbing and electrics: $54,300</p><p>· Gas meter relocation: $10,860</p><p>· Professional fees: $84,200</p><p>· VAT @ 20% (tax payable to U.K. government): $130,330</p><p>TOTAL: About $653,000</p><p>It Isn't 'Downton Abbey,' but It Is the Perfect Home for Them</p>",
