  "text": "<p>Chevron is providing new energy to its green spending. The oil giant pledged to spend $10 billion through 2028 on biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies, up from a prior commitment of around $3 billion. The investment comes as investors increasingly ask oil companies to diversify beyond fossil fuels and explain how they will navigate tightening global oil and gas regulations. The planned low-carbon spending still represents a fraction of what Chevron is spending on oil and gas projects. Chevron shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.</p><p>KROGER CO.</p><p>KR -2.5%</p><p>Kroger is stepping into a crowded market, partnering with Instacart Inc. to deliver food and household staples in as little as 30 minutes. The partnership is one of many new attempts across the grocery industry to grab a bigger slice of consumer spending. Consistent profitability in delivery is hard to reach because of high labor and transportation costs. Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said the grocer tested 30-minute delivery about two years ago and found it difficult to expand the service quickly using its own staff. Kroger shares fell 2.5% Tuesday.</p><p>WYNN RESORTS LTD.</p><p>WYNN -11%</p><p>Luck may be running out for casinos operating in Macau. On Tuesday, officials who govern the Chinese territory set expectations for increased regulatory scrutiny of the gambling industry. Six casino licenses for Wynn Resorts and other Las Vegas operators are set to expire in June 2022. In the year before the pandemic started, Macau supplied about 70% of revenue for Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands Corp. Wynn Resorts shares declined 11% Tuesday.</p><p>ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.</p><p>HOOD +4.6%</p><p>Robinhood has a new target: college students. The go-to trading app for young investors is now recruiting new customers on campus tours, giving students who sign up using their school email address $15 to trade and entering them in a $20,000 giveaway. The campaign includes stops at community colleges and historically Black colleges and universities this fall. Millions of users downloaded the company's app earlier this year, but Robinhood has forecast that new account openings would decelerate in the third quarter. Robinhood shares rose 4.6% Wednesday.</p><p>MATCH GROUP INC.</p><p>MTCH +0.7%</p><p>The company behind Tinder and OkCupid wants to break up with Apple and Google -- or their app stores, at least. The online-dating company is working to sidestep payments systems run by the tech giants following moves by U.S. and South Korean authorities. A federal judge in California recently ruled that Apple can't block app developers from sending their users outside its app store to pay, while South Korea lawmakers last month passed legislation requiring Apple and Google to open their app stores to alternative payment methods. Match shares added 0.7% Thursday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -0.2%</p><p>It's back-to-school season, but retailers are already preparing for the holidays. Amazon said on Tuesday it plans to add 125,000 employees in the U.S. as it continues to rapidly expand its vast warehouse operations in a tight labor market. Amazon has opened more than 250 facilities to store, sort and ship packages this year and plans to open 100 more across the country in September. The company also lifted pay for workers in such facilities to an average of $18.32 an hour as it seeks to fill the new jobs and replace workers who leave existing positions. Amazon shares lost 0.2% Tuesday.</p><p>INVESCO LTD.</p><p>IVZ +5.5%</p><p>Two money managers may decide their best investment is in each other. Invesco is in talks to merge with State Street Corp.'s asset-management business, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. A potential deal would likely be one of the industry's biggest in recent memory. The State Street unit manages nearly $4 trillion in assets, while Invesco oversees $1.5 trillion. Many asset managers are considering unions to lower expenses and cut fees as investor appetite for low-cost funds thins their profit margins. Invesco shares gained 5.5% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
