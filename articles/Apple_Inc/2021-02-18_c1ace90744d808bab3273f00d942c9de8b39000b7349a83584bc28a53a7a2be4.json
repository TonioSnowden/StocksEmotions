  "text": "<p>It has not been an easy time for American fashion. While the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3dd2ba8-6df0-4dcb-bd55-25ec246bdbc0\">luxury goods sector has proved remarkably resilient during the pandemic</a>, it is the big, conglomerate-backed European brands that have fared best.</p> <p>Yet a cautious optimism pervaded the mostly digital New York Fashion Week, detectable from my kitchen table 3,000 miles away. There was a feeling of hope — both for the end of the pandemic and of lockdowns, which were further eased in New York City last week, and for the new Biden administration, whose members <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/649ce178-f790-489f-ae77-3a955fdcd702\">American fashion designers are already eager to dress</a>.</p> <p>Many major names were absent, including Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, The Row, Coach and Carolina Herrera. Missing too was Council of Fashion Designers of America chairman Tom Ford, who postponed his show hours before its scheduled debut. Some of the designers will show in a few weeks, when their collections are ready; others, such as The Row, showed in January to take advantage of the pre-collection buying period.</p> <p>Whereas missing fashion week was once seen as a sign of business trouble, designers say the pandemic has freed them from the necessity of hosting shows. “We no longer feel the pressure we used to,” says Prabal Gurung, the Nepalese-American who outfitted Kamala Harris in a garnet wool crêpe dress and matching coat on day two of last month's inauguration ceremonies. “If a collection requires a digital video and a lookbook and that's enough, that's it. Before this, we all thought about [skipping shows], we were so exhausted, but no one had the courage to say no.”</p> <p>This season, Gurung designed a gender-fluid collection he described as a “sonnet to the city”. Splashed in polka dots and florals or dyed in pink and red — colours that suggest “auspicious beginnings” in his native Nepal, he said — it was high on glamour without sacrificing the comfort and casual fabrics that customers have learnt to value more in lockdown.</p> <p>Some American brands have had a banner year despite Covid-19. Gabriela Hearst and Khaite are two labels that excel at discreet luxury, and have cultivated a following that extends beyond American shores.</p> <p>In 2019, Hearst opened her first store in London and was last year appointed creative director at Richemont-owned Chloé — making her the first US-based designer since Alexander Wang to helm a major French luxury label. </p> <p>Her '70s-inflected clothes are deeply luxurious, and each season she conjures up new twists on her hero pieces — double-breasted wool trenchcoats, flared trouser suits, midi skirts in leather and wool — that are just novel enough to keep customers buying. Handbags, too, are a speciality (which she keeps exclusive by selling them only through her own stores).</p> <p>She and her two-person design team achieve all this while reducing the label's environmental impact: all knitwear is made of recycled yarn, and this year half of all products will be made of deadstock or repurposed fabrics. By 2022, she has pledged to bring that number up to 80 per cent.</p> <p>Among the highlights from this season's collection are a black leather dress and coat woven into a herringbone pattern up the front and back, and a dainty slip dress with a ribbed knit bodice and floral lace centre reportedly adapted from a drawing by Hearst's daughter Mia. A substantial top-handle bag comes with a woven carrier and a base that swivels open to reveal a secret compartment. </p> <p>“I have always believed building a luxury brand takes time,” says LVMH-backed Hearst, who attributes much of her success to her instinctive approach to design. “We don't have a merchandiser [telling us what to design]. So we design things we ourselves want.”</p> <p>A strong design instinct is also what drives five-year-old Khaite, where sales climbed 70 per cent last year and are expected to grow another 120 per cent in 2021, thanks to a sharp increase in wholesale interest from Europe and continuing demand for the label's lush, structured knits. Founder and designer Catherine Holstein is planning to open four “shop-in-shops” (shops within department stores) next year, three of which will be in Europe, and is “tentatively” looking for her first full store space.</p> <p>I ask whether she has any advice for younger designers. “Don't be afraid to be commercial or mainstream,” she says. “Do not shy away from identifying the items people actually want to buy. What I find most troubling about fashion education is that knits are usually an elective. But everywhere I've worked, knits were 60 to 70 per cent of the business. Fashion students are set up to fail.”</p> <p>She is not releasing her autumn/winter 2021 collection until next week, which she says is heavy on jersey dresses and bodysuits (of the 1980s/1990s Donna Karan, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy variety) starting at $500 for a bodysuit and $1,580 for a dress. She is also introducing more puffers in patent leather and cashmere with faux fur collars.</p> <p>“I don't think this comfort factor is going to be dropped,” Holstein says of what we'll be wearing post-pandemic. “People want to be free. Silhouettes will become straighter. It's reminiscent of the '20s, coming off of the Spanish flu.”</p> <p>With the wholesale market in flux, it is by no means an easy time to be a young designer. Long gone are the days when a career was launched with an exclusive at New York department store Barneys and a profile in Vogue. Yet some up-and-coming talents are making their own way, with fun, colourful, body-conscious clothes that appeal to their own peer group.</p> <p>That includes the label Collina Strada, which looked to the 1990s paperback series <em>Animorphs</em> for its trippy collection (and lookbook). And Kanye West-backed Maisie Wilen, whose perforated knits and 1990s-inspired party dresses have garnered endorsements from celebrities and stockists such as Selfridges. Her autumn/winter collection, with its uplifting, saccharine palette, stretchy fabrics and digital prints (which she designed herself) looked both fun and freeing — just the thing to wear in or out of lockdown.</p> <p>Creating a collection during a pandemic has not been without its challenges. “It has been really challenging for everybody,” says Anna Sui, who has shown at New York Fashion Week for three decades. “We've been staggering hours and coming in in shifts. A lot of our textiles are from Italy or China, and at various stages we have been unable to get fabrics.” Some local manufacturers she works with have gone out of business.</p> <p>The psychedelic collection Sui showed via digital video this week was smaller in size but nevertheless packed a punch. “I had been thinking about this 1968 film <em>Wonderwall</em>, with George Harrison, which starts out with this professor who has a very traditional, very boring life. One night he comes in and peeks through a hole in the wall, and realises next door is a swinging '60s fashion model, he sees this colourful life she's leading, with these great psychedelic clothes”. And so her collection begins in black and white, and then becomes wildly colourful — magenta, amber, turquoise.</p> <p>“We are in that limbo right now — waiting for life to start up again, waiting for that black and white moment to burst into full colour. Everyone is feeling that same way, all this pent-up creativity and energy. It's going to be like the roaring '20s.”</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
