  "title": "Heard on the Street:  A $2 Trillion Value Would Up Ante for Microsoft  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  As Microsoft is learning early, $2 trillion comes with a price. </p><p>\n  The software giant has been flirting with that market value all month -- coming closest on Tuesday ahead of its fiscal third quarter results. The stock ended the day within about 1% of that milestone, where it would have joined Apple Inc. in the rarefied air of $2 trillion enterprises. </p><p>\n  Alas, it wasn't quite to be. Microsoft's results were solid enough; the company reported its best revenue growth since 2017. But that beat Wall Street's consensus forecast by less than 2% compared with the 7% beat delivered by Google parent Alphabet Inc. on the same afternoon. </p><p>\n  Microsoft's operating income gain of 31% year-over-year paled next to the internet advertising titan's 106% bottom line boost. The two had been the best-performing stocks of the big technology bunch for the year to date ahead of their respective reports on Tuesday. </p><p>\n  In a frothy market, though, only blowout results seem to count. Microsoft's share price fell nearly 3% on Wednesday. </p><p>\n  But based on the results and accompanying forecast, $2 trillion will be a reality sooner than later. Microsoft seems to be firing on all cylinders, with revenue growth accelerating and trailing 12-month operating margins now at 40% compared with 30% four years ago. </p><p>\n  A sharp focus on the cloud has remade the company once reliant on the Windows operating system. Intelligent cloud is now Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing business segment. </p><p>\n  Analyst Brad Reback of Stifel estimates that the Azure cloud computing service became the company's largest single source of revenue in the March quarter, growing 50% year over year to $7.8 billion. He estimates it will also be Microsoft's largest gross profit contributor within the next two years. </p><p>\n  Still, a $2 trillion market value does raise the stakes a bit. </p><p>\n  The software giant is now worth more than both Alphabet and Amazon.com, both of which generate more revenue and higher growth rates -- and in the case of Amazon an even stronger position in the cloud. The two companies sport market values of around $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively. </p><p>\n  It also could bring a brighter spotlight to a company that has so far avoided the intense government scrutiny currently focused on its big tech competitors. </p><p>\n  Microsoft, once a target of regulators at home and abroad, has been enjoying its lack of notoriety lately, publicly calling for more regulations on its peers while also chasing big deals that the others would be hard pressed to make right now. Operational excellence got Microsoft where it is today, but $2 trillion attracts a lot of eyeballs. </p><p></p>",
