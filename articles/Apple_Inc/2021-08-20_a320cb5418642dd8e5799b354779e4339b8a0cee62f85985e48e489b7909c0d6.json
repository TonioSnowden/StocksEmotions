  "text": "<p>In June, Chief Executive Tim Cook told Apple office workers they would be expected to return to their workplaces three days a week beginning in September.</p><p>A surge in Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant has caused many companies to rethink their plans to bring employees back to the office. Other large technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. have delayed their office return until January.</p><p>Apple last year was among the first U.S. companies to have workers stay at home when the pandemic started. The company has on several occasions closed its retail stores amid virus outbreaks in certain areas. Apple began to gradually reopen its stores and had all U.S. retail locations back open in March.</p><p>Apple has strongly encouraged all of its employees to wear masks and has required them to do so in about 45% of stores.</p><p>Write to Sebastian Herrera at Sebastian.Herrera@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Postpones Return to Office Until January</p>",
