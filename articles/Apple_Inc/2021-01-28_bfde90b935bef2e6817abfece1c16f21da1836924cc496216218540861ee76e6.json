  "text": "<p>Facebook posted record quarterly revenues as the company's push into ecommerce during coronavirus lockdowns bore fruit, although chief executive Mark Zuckerberg warned of a growing competitive threat from Apple. </p> <p>Fourth-quarter revenues at the social media group rose 33 per cent to $28.1bn, surpassing analyst expectations of an increase to $26.4bn. Net income jumped 53 per cent to $11.2bn, or $3.88 a share. </p> <p>In a statement, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7e37c19e-8fa3-439f-a870-b33f0520bcc0\">Facebook</a>'s chief financial officer David Wehner said the business had been boosted by “the ongoing shift towards online commerce” and “the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the company also outlined a range of challenges causing uncertainty in the year ahead. </p> <p>Among them, Mr Zuckerberg took repeated swipes at Apple, citing its forthcoming privacy changes to the iOS 14 operating system, which requires applications on iPhones to obtain users' permission to harvest advertisement targeting and tracking data. </p> <p>Facebook has previously warned Apple's restrictions, due to come into force later this year, will hurt its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a72d3d7-f2ec-4bb1-9f61-d65afba41821\">ad business</a> as well as that of its small business clients.</p> <p>“Apple may say that they're doing this to help people. But the moves clearly track their competitive interest,” Mr Zuckerberg said on Wednesday on a call with analysts. </p> <p>“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our app and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” he said, adding the company was increasingly becoming “one of our biggest competitors”. </p> <p>In another barb, Mr Zuckerberg said his group's WhatsApp messaging platform was “clearly superior” to Apple's iMessage in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54c54efb-7c80-4468-bf8f-c646e2bbe07f\">privacy protections</a> it afforded users. </p> <p>Jessica Liu, senior analyst at Forrester, said: “The hyper-targeting that makes Facebook's properties so attractive for advertisers won't disappear overnight but will grow increasingly more difficult — forcing Facebook, Inc to rethink its ad model.”</p> <p>Monthly active users grew 12 per cent year-on-year to 2.8bn, Facebook said. </p> <p>The company bet big on “social commerce” across all its apps last year as people retreated indoors under shelter-in-place restrictions. It launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/690ee286-99b6-4fa8-b02d-cfd50448a53d\">Facebook Shops</a>, which allows businesses to set up digital storefronts, as well as payments tools in several markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, the company's efforts to merge the messaging functions of its trio of apps — Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram — for the purposes of facilitating more shopping have not been seamless. WhatsApp this month was compelled to delay the rollout of an updated policy allowing it to share more transaction data with Facebook after the changes sparked privacy concerns and sent users flocking to lesser-known rival apps.</p> <p>Facebook is also facing significant legal and regulatory challenges. The US Federal Trade Commission and 46 US states last month filed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c03ac0f-7122-4c31-97a5-ecab3928a038\">antitrust lawsuits</a> against the company, accusing it of wielding its dominance to crush competition. </p> <p>Its content moderation policies and processes have come under scrutiny after the Capitol riots earlier this month, and it has also attracted criticism over its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74b6cc94-cfc4-46cf-b404-e3078b752bc8\">decision to suspend</a> former US president Donald Trump's account “indefinitely”.</p> <p>Mr Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Facebook was exploring ways “to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation”, particularly in users' news feeds. </p> <p>As part of this, the company would stop recommending political and civic groups to users, he said. In October Facebook had temporarily switched off making such recommendations to US users specifically ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-presidential-election-2020\">election</a>; that move is now permanent and affects users globally. </p><p>Source: Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 2021 'Facebook revenue lifted by ecommerce push during pandemic' FT.com 28 January.
