  "text": "<p>Ski resorts in France are warning they are facing a “life or death” struggle if they are unable to open next month. Operators had been hoping to start their lifts for the first time on January 8 but instead prime minister Jean Castex announced the closure would continue until at least February, with a review to be announced on January 20. “It's clear that if we do not open in February, the season is finished, and the resorts will have real problems of survival,”&#xa0;said Dominique Marcel, chief executive of the Compagnie des Alpes, the country's biggest resort operator, speaking on the French television channel BFM Business. “It's a matter of life or death for certain parties — that's not an exaggeration.”</p> <p>February, which includes the two-week French school holidays, is the most important period for the country's resorts, representing 35 per cent of the winter's income, according to the National Association of Mayors of Mountain Resorts (ANMSM). Ordinarily the ski season would directly support 120,000 jobs, it says, warning of the potential for lasting damage to mountain communities. “The consequence of not opening is the risk of the definitive and irreversible destruction of our economic model,” it said in a statement. “70 years of economic development in the mountains must not be destroyed in the space of a few months!”</p> <p>Jean-Luc Boch, mayor of La Plagne and president of the ANMSM, said official arguments for continued closure were no longer valid, because the lack of visitors over Christmas meant there was no hospital overcrowding, while the introduction of testing centres and other measures meant safety could be guaranteed. Others fear any further delay to a decision would leave potential customers with no time to plan a holiday. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The government needs to let us know by January 20 if ski lifts can open or not,” says Eric Bouchet, director of the tourist office at Les 2 Alpes. “We can't just snap our fingers and open, it takes some planning. At some point it will just be too late and not worth opening at all.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Even when lifts do open, international guests may be unable to come. In normal years more than 42 per cent of Val d'Isère's guests, for example, come from the UK, where the latest lockdown means foreign travel is currently impossible. Already some British tour operators have thrown in the towel for the season. Le Ski, which runs chalet holidays in Courchevel, Val d'Isère and La Tania, announced last week that it would be running no trips this winter, for the first time in 38 years. Family specialist Esprit Ski has already cancelled its winter season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Italy is due to announce on January 18 if its resorts can reopen. Some resorts in Austria are open but only to locals, and a decision on whether they can welcome tourists is expected on January 24. Ski areas in some parts of Switzerland remain open, but this weekend's Lauberhorn downhill, a highlight of the World Cup season, has been called off.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first </em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
