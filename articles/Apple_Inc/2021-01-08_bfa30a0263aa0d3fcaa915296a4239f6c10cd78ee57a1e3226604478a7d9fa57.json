  "title": "U.S. News:  Amazon to Invest in  Affordable Housing  ----  By Nicole Friedman",
  "text": "<p>    Amazon.com Inc. said it would commit more than $2 billion to create and preserve affordable housing in three of its employment hubs, the latest tech giant to make a large investment in easing the U.S. housing shortage. </p><p>   Amazon said it intends to invest in affordable housing during the next five years in three regions where it is a major employer: Seattle, Arlington, Va., and Nashville, Tenn. </p><p>   The online giant has more than 75,000 workers in the Seattle area, its main headquarters. Amazon has more than 1,000 employees each in Arlington, across the Potomac from Washington, D.C., where it is establishing a second headquarters, and in Nashville, where the company is building an operations center. It plans to have at least 5,000 employees in each region within five years. </p><p>   The bulk of its investment will be through low-cost loans to preserve or build affordable housing, Amazon said. The company also will offer grants to public agencies and minority-led housing organizations. </p><p>   \"We don't have control over how the [housing] markets respond to a large employer coming into the market or expanding in the market, but we can play a role in how Amazon's growth is impacting our local communities,\" said Catherine Buell, head of community development for one of Amazon's philanthropic arms. </p><p>   Many large tech companies in 2019 committed to investing in affordable housing. Job growth has outpaced new housing supply in many large cities, especially on the West Coast. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has committed $1 billion toward Bay Area housing, and Apple Inc. pledged $2.5 billion for housing throughout California. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp. has committed $750 million toward affordable housing in the Seattle area. </p><p>   For some of the world's largest tech companies, these phased-in housing commitments aren't expected to have a big impact on their bottom lines. Amazon doesn't expect to make money from these housing investments and there is no special tax treatment for them, according to a person familiar with the program. </p><p>   Many housing advocates have welcomed these contributions, saying large employers such as tech companies have played a role in driving up home prices by attracting well-paid workers who can pay more for housing than longtime residents. </p><p>   Advocates also say these investments aren't expected to solve the housing shortages for lower- and even middle-income earners in these expensive metro areas. </p><p></p>",
