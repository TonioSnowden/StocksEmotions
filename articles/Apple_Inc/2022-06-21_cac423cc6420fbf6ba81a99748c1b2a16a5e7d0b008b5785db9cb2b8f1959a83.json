  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Family & Tech:  Dads Are Often the IT Guys  When Couples Divide Chores  ----  By Julie Jargon",
  "text": "<p>   Faheem Noor Ali cares for his toddler and manages the household when his wife, an obstetrician, is on call. </p><p>   He also plays the role of live-in IT guy. He's now managing the transfer of cable and internet services to a new house they're moving into, setting up the Wi-Fi and installing new security cameras and smart-home devices. </p><p>   Sometimes, he says, it can get overwhelming. </p><p>   To keep track of all the to-dos and his wife's unpredictable schedule, the Washington, D.C.-area government worker and his wife share calendars, iPhone notes and a Dropbox account. They also jot things down on a physical calendar posted to their fridge. </p><p>   Mr. Noor Ali's outlet from the stress of work and life is playing basketball with friends, something he's been doing each week since before he got married. He said his wife, Aliya Ladha, has always been supportive of him having time to himself, but he knows dads who struggle to do so. </p><p>   \"I think what you'll find with most men is that it's difficult to ask for space to take care of themselves because they just feel guilty,\" he said. </p><p>   A recent column of mine focused on a common imbalance in household workloads that couples can face. Often, women handle the majority of household and child-care chores, even when they're as occupied by work as men. But men and women aren't that different when it comes to feeling overwhelmed by these demands. For many dads such as Mr. Noor Ali, part of the invisible task of managing a household often includes home tech support. </p><p>   What's different is how men and women typically cope with burnout: Women tend to talk about it, while men often keep it to themselves, according to psychologists and others who study gender equality. These experts say same-sex couples can face burnout, too, but noted that workload imbalances are more usual among heterosexual couples because of age-old gender-role stereotypes. </p><p>   There are some efforts to build new online communities to make it easier for men to find real-life support. The pandemic strained all types of relationships. Some broke apart under that stress, while others learned how to communicate better about their needs, according to many couples I interviewed. </p><p>   Dr. Ladha said she and her husband had trouble communicating with each other after their daughter was born during the pandemic and benefited from couples therapy. \"We try to support each other and tell each other to be vocal,\" she said. </p><p>   Now that Dr. Ladha is expecting another baby, Mr. Noor Ali said he skips trips to the gym more often. And while shooting hoops with his buddies, he said, talk rarely turns to feelings of being overwhelmed. \"I don't know if that's necessarily healthy. You just want to talk about sports, not your feelings.\" </p><p>   Building communities </p><p>   Paul Sullivan last year ended his lengthy newspaper career, most recently as a New York Times wealth columnist, to build the Company of Dads. It's an online community and weekly podcast to support dads who take on the role of default parent. He said he wants to help men feel comfortable speaking up about their parental responsibilities -- including at work, and not just when they first become fathers. </p><p>   \"The penalty for saying you want to spend more time with your kids is you'll be seen as less committed to work,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"We talk about paid parental leave, and that's a good place to start, but what happens when your child is 11 or 17 and they need you because they're having a crisis?\" </p><p>   He said he has always been the lead parent, coordinating the schedules of his three kids -- who range from 5 years old to 13 -- and communicating with their schools. (His wife runs an asset-management recruiting firm and has less flexibility in her schedule, he said.) </p><p>   Mr. Sullivan said it can be hard for men to cope with feeling overwhelmed because they rarely talk about it. \"To admit something as unmasculine as being burned out is really challenging for a man to do,\" he said. </p><p>   Let's whiteboard it </p><p>   Conversations around gender equality in the home reached a crescendo during the pandemic when, even in households where both spouses were working from home, women took on more of the child care and housework, according to researchers at the University of Georgia and Rice University. </p><p>   It's not that men don't know how to do the things moms do -- it's that they don't always bring the team-building skills they develop at work into the home, said Brian Anderson, co-founder and executive director of Fathering Together, a nonprofit network of groups for dads. </p><p>   Many women don't ask their male partners to help manage the invisible labor of school communication, child-care arrangements and the like for reasons ranging from fear of confrontation to the feeling that caregiving is part of their identity, according to some mom-led groups that advocate for gender equality in the home and workplace. Many women became exhausted during the pandemic and put their careers on hold or exited the workforce altogether to care for their kids and oversee remote school. </p><p>   Following my mom-burnout column, many men told me they contribute equally to their homes. I contacted dozens of fathers to ask what types of work they do that's invisible to their partners and whether they use any technology to help manage the load. </p><p>   None said they use labor-sharing apps, which developers have been touting as means to greater domestic equality. Many dads share online calendars and notes with their partners to manage grocery lists and other tasks. And almost all of them said they rely on whiteboards (yes, physical whiteboards!) to divide and track duties. </p><p>   When it comes to invisible labor, many men said they handle online orders for groceries and household supplies and manage finances online. The majority of men told me they shoulder all of their home's tech responsibilities, which can get overwhelming. They set up their home's electronics and Wi-Fi, manage parental controls on their kids' devices, handle subscriptions to streaming services and troubleshoot the home's tech troubles. </p><p>   \"I leave all of that up to him,\" said Dr. Ladha, Mr. Noor Ali's wife. \"He knows the IT stuff so I might as well let him own it.\" </p><p>   David Baratka, a Chicago-area father who manages payroll and HR applications for a law firm, handles the IT duties in his home, too. He has two sons from a previous marriage, and his wife has a daughter. Whenever he became overwhelmed with work and managing his blended home, he struggled to ask for help. Recently, however, he and his wife started communicating more about their needs. </p><p>   He said he and his wife have noticed the same gender dynamics playing out among their kids. \"My boys don't ask for help as much,\" he said. \"We're trying to teach them the benefits of asking for help -- that it's not a weakness.\" </p><p></p>",
