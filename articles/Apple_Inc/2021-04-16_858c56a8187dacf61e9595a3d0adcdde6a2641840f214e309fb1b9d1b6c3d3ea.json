  "title": "AppLovin Falls 19% From Its IPO Price in Market Debut  ----  By Matt Grossman",
  "text": "<p>   Shares of AppLovin Corp. ended their first day of trading down 19%, after the mobile-apps company raised $1.8 billion in its initial public offering. </p><p>   The company's stock closed at $65.20, compared with its IPO price of $80 a share. The Silicon Valley-based company is valued at more than $25 billion, based on its closing price Thursday. </p><p>   AppLovin makes tools for developers of smartphone apps to improve marketing and revenue. It also runs more than 200 of its own mobile-game apps. </p><p>   The two sides of the business are complementary, Chief Executive Adam Foroughi said, because the data that AppLovin gleans from how users play its games yields insights that its enterprise customers can use to market their apps. </p><p>   That capability gives AppLovin an advantage amid rising concerns about how apps share data with third parties, Mr. Foroughi said in an interview. Because it can study data from its own apps, AppLovin has less of a need to access data from its enterprise customers' apps, he said. </p><p>   He added that he thinks AppLovin will be well positioned amid a move by Apple Inc. to give users more control over how apps can share data with third parties. </p><p>   The company's acquisitions of apps have been a significant revenue driver. </p><p>   Eric Handler, an analyst at MKM Partners, said the trading decline Thursday may stem from how investors are thinking about the two sides of AppLovin's business. </p><p>   AppLovin \"was trying to get a multiple more in line with an ad-tech platform play,\" Mr. Handler said. \"In reality, much of their revenue comes from their own first-party games.\" </p><p>   Last year, AppLovin logged revenue of $1.45 billion, up 46% from $994.1 million in 2019. Revenue from consumers within its own apps grew by 86% to $739.9 million last year, surpassing revenue from businesses. </p><p>   The volume of in-app purchases for the company's apps rose 41% year over year, and the average price of such purchases climbed by nearly a third. </p><p>   In 2020, AppLovin notched a loss of $125.2 million, or 58 cents a share. It posted a profit of $76.6 million, or 36 cents a share, the prior year. </p><p>   \"Our business is quite profitable from a cash perspective,\" Mr. Foroughi said, noting that the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization topped $300 million in each of the last two years. </p><p>   Recent share offerings have granted multibillion-dollar valuations to other companies focused on videogames played online. The direct listing in March of Roblox Corp., which operates a videogame platform used mostly by children, set a valuation of roughly $45 billion on its first trading day. </p><p>   Also last month, ironSource Ltd. -- which, like AppLovin, provides advertising services for app-based games -- agreed to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that values ironSource at $11.1 billion. </p><p>   Some investors have raised concerns that growth will slow for companies, such as Roblox, that reaped an outsize benefit during the pandemic as children who were taking classes from home had more time for videogames. </p><p>   Mr. Foroughi said trends like that one are less of an issue for AppLovin because more of its customers are adults who tend to play mobile games during commutes and other downtime. </p><p></p>",
