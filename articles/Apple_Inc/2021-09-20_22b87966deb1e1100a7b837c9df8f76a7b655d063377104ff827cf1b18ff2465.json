The 440ml cans will be produced using primary metal from Rusal's Krasnoyarsk plant in Siberia with hydropower and are due to go on sale in the UK this year.</p> <p>“The is the first commercial rollout of a near-zero carbon — or 0.01 per cent — aluminium,” said Greg Barker, executive chair of En+ Group, the parent company of Rusal. “It is the first time it has been done at scale.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4a0f8f6-5252-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294\">Rusal is in competition</a> with a consortium comprising Rio Tinto,&#xa0;Alcoa and&#xa0;Apple to develop a carbon-free version of aluminium and tap growing consumer demand for responsibly sourced commodities and raw materials.</p> <p>It comes as the EU <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de7d12e2-0d04-43d4-b38c-cf795854a4a2\">prepares to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax</a> on an array of products including imported steel, aluminium, fertiliser and cement.</p> <p>The existing low-carbon aluminium brands already available, such as Rusal's ALLOW, are mainly produced using smelters powered by hydroelectric dams. The emphasis is now on developing a greener way of processing alumina, the key ingredient used to make the metal.<br><br>In the traditional smelting process, a carbon anode is placed in a bath that contains alumina and other materials. A strong electrical current is then passed through the bath to produce aluminium.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rusal and its rivals have been working on advanced conductive material that releases oxygen rather than carbon. This is called an inert anode and has been used to make the aluminium for Budweiser Brewing Group, the UK division of Anheuser-Busch InBev.</p> <p>Barker said the goal of mass-producing completely carbon-free aluminium was still some way off because Rusal was still trying to “perfect the technology”. </p> <p>The 5m cans — which will be filled in breweries in South Wales and Lancashire powered by renewable electricity — account for just a fraction of the beer Budweiser produces in the UK. The group brews more than 20m cans and bottles of Budweiser each week. </p> <p>“The challenge for the next decade is to . . . bring down the price of large scale production runs,” said Barker, a former UK energy and climate change minister. </p> <p>Inert anode technology is a big part of plans outlined this week by En+ to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. </p> <p>Rusal, the largest producer of aluminium outside China, is 57 per cent owned by En+, which was previously controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska before he was hit by US sanctions.</p> <p>In May, Rusal announced plans to demerge its high-carbon smelters and refineries into a new company that will be listed in Moscow so that it can focus on the market for “green” aluminium. </p> <p>Under the break-up plan, Rusal will change its name to AL+ and keep its 12 most modern smelters and refineries as well as important mining assets. En+ will remain its majority shareholder.</p> <p>Barker said Rusal's bauxite assets in Guinea had not been significantly affected by this month's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2f4f6a7-b8f6-42a8-a065-061d372282f8\">military coup</a>. Bauxite is the raw material needed to produce alumina. </p> <p>“The ports are open,” said Barker. “There were three days when staff were not coming into work and were advised to shelter until the situation became clear. But there certainly doesn't seem to have been a breakdown in law and order, which was our first concern,” he added.</p><p>Source: Neil Hume, Natural Resources Editor 2021 'Rusal strikes deal to supply Budweiser with ultra-low carbon cans ' FT.com 20 September.
