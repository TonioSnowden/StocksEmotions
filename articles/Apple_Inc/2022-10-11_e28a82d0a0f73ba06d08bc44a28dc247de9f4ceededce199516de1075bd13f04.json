He had been serving a life sentence at the Patuxent Institution, a state prison in Jessup, Md., according to state records.</p><p>A Baltimore Circuit judge vacated Mr. Syed's murder conviction in September after prosecutors said new evidence suggested there were two suspects who may have been involved in Ms. Lee's death, including one who had told someone he would make her disappear.
