  "text": "<p>\n  DICK'S SPORTING GOODS INC. </p><p>\n  DKS -6.3% </p><p>\n  The late stages of the pandemic will test the stamina of Dick's Sporting Goods. The retailer said Tuesday that it expects sales to ease this year after last year's growth, fueled by strong demand for at-home fitness equipment. Like other retailers, Dick's strengthened its e-commerce operation last year to reach shoppers adjusting to new work and lifestyle patterns. Now, the company faces the challenge of maintaining momentum and building on last year's gains. Other retail chains like Walmart Inc. have also said they believe growth will slow. Dick's shares lost 6.3% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GAMESTOP CORP. </p><p>\n  GME +41% </p><p>\n  Online trading mobs drove up GameStop's value. Now the retailer faces pressure to turn itself around. GameStop said Monday that its board formed a committee dedicated to transforming the videogame company led by Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen. Last year, Mr. Cohen bought a large stake in GameStop and started pushing the company to revamp its business model. The company has struggled in recent years, facing competition from Amazon.com Inc. and other large online retailers as well as changing gaming habits. GameStop shares soared 41% Monday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. </p><p>\n  GE -5.4% </p><p>\n  The lights are going out at GE Capital. General Electric on Wednesday agreed to combine GE Capital Aviation Services, the jet-leasing unit of the once-sprawling lender, with rival AerCap Holdings AER in a deal worth more than $30 billion. Chief Executive Larry Culp, who said the deal simplifies the industrial giant, will use the proceeds to shed debts that have hung over GE since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The remainder of GE Capital, a legacy insurance business and a small equipment-leasing operation, will be folded into the company's corporate operations. GE shares fell 5.4% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  STITCH FIX INC. </p><p>\n  SFIX -28% </p><p>\n  Stitch Fix is all tangled up because of problems at the post office. The online fashion retailer on Monday reported underwhelming results for the holiday quarter that the company largely attributed to shipping delays. Stitch Fix ships clothes to customers who can keep what they want and return the rest, and the U.S. Postal Service is its main carrier. The USPS struggled to manage surging package volumes during the pandemic as consumers turned to online shopping while FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. limited packages they accepted. Stitch Fix shares fell 28% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS INC. </p><p>\n  AMC +4.4% </p><p>\n  The curtain is rising again at U.S. movie theaters. AMC, the world's largest cinema chain, has reopened many of its theaters in recent weeks after a winter surge of Covid-19 cases prompted closures at the end of 2020. Roughly 527 out of 589 domestic theaters were open as of March 5, and expects new films and vaccine distribution to bring better results this year. AMC on Wednesday reported an annual loss of $4.59 billion for 2020; the company has been able to avoid bankruptcy thanks to new money from investors. AMC shares rose 4.4% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AMAZON.COM INC. </p><p>\n  AMZN -0.8% </p><p>\n  Amazon won't sell books framing LGBTQ+ identities as mental illnesses. The company stated its policy on Thursday in a letter to several Republican senators who wrote to Amazon asking why a three-year-old book about transgender issues by a conservative scholar was no longer available for purchase. In the letter Amazon also said it provides customers \"with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable\" but reserves the right not to sell certain content. Amazon shares fell 0.8% Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  VIACOMCBS INC. </p><p>\n  VIAC +13% </p><p>\n  A new British invasion is generating a princely sum for some American companies. Some 17.1 million viewers tuned in on March 7 to Oprah Winfrey's interview with Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle on the ViacomCBS-owned CBS network, which paid at least $7 million to air it. Ms. Winfrey and Prince Harry are also creating a mental-health special for Apple TV+. ViacomCBS shares rose 13% Monday. </p><p></p>",
