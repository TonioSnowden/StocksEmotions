  "text": "<p>Playing the most insouciant action hero since Sean Connery last ordered a martini, Ryan Gosling marks the end of a four-year disappearing act with \"The Gray Man,\" his first feature since the underappreciated \"First Man\" of 2018. Goslingites are eager; fans of the Russo brothers (\"Avengers: Endgame\" and other Marvel excesses) are agog; Netflix is on eggshells waiting to see whether spending an alleged $200 million to destroy Prague (and several other architectural treasures) will lift it out of the doldrums. There's a lot happening here.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Last Movie Stars (HBO Max)</p><p>Among the many inspired, even wondrous choices made by Ethan Hawke in \"The Last Movie Stars\" is opening with a clip from \"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.\" Adapted from two novels by Evan S. Connell, the 1990 Merchant-Ivory production starred Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in one of the 16 films the couple made together, and sets them up the same way Mr. Hawke's documentary series frames them over its six episodes: Newman, even at age 65, seizes the screen, as he had for most of his career. But Ms. Woodward is the subtler artist, delivering a performance of such delicacy that Oscar watchers were probably shocked that she received a Best Actress nomination at all. (And then lost, predictably, to Kathy Bates for \"Misery,\" thus setting the universe back on its axis.)</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Colosseum (The History Channel)</p><p>The bread-and-circuses approach to public policy has never been more ambitiously or outrageously memorialized than by the eternal centerpiece of the Eternal City—the subject of \"Colosseum,\" the History Channel's eight-parter about the Roman Empire, as framed by its signature architectural achievement. \"The Colosseum is the Roman Empire distilled to its most basic essence,\" says one of the series' myriad academics and historians—meaning power, domination and cruelty. \"That's entertainment!\" one might add. It certainly was in A.D. 80.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Last Looks (AMC+)</p><p>A stainless-steel elephant plays a significant role in \"Last Looks,\" but the elephant in the room is most certainly Mel Gibson, about whom everyone has an opinion. One ought to be that the actor has always had tremendous comic timing, something he gets to put on full display in director Tim Kirkby's revisionist film noir, in a role that seems to find its inspirations in Foghorn Leghorn, Winston Churchill and William Shatner.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Fire of Love</p><p>In the documentary \"Fire of Love,\" we have barely gotten to know a pair of impossibly daring French volcanologists when the narrator delivers these grim words: \"1991. June second. Tomorrow will be their last day.\" The film about their astounding lives has an impact few blockbusters can hope to match. Picture \"Twister\" with volcano eruptions substituting for cyclones, except it's a true story with a shattering final act.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Dickie V (ESPN+)</p><p>\"I once didn't speak to Dick Vitale for six months,\" Bob Costas is said to have said. \"I didn't think it was right to interrupt him.\" It's not an original line, and Mr. Costas doesn't even deliver it himself during \"Dickie V,\" ESPN's very affectionate profile of its celebrated sports announcer. But it says a lot about Mr. Vitale, aka the verbal firehose of college basketball, and the good-natured regard with which his colleagues hold both him and his signature eccentricities.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>My Donkey, My Lover &amp; I</p><p>Normally, a movie featuring a jealous lover twitching behind the shrubbery while anxiously pursuing the beloved is a tale of a pathetic middle-aged man. So let's hear it for equal-opportunity humiliation. The French charmer \"My Donkey, My Lover &amp; I\" centers on a lovestruck woman who embarrasses herself as much as any fool played by Peter Sellers or Dudley Moore ever did. The film is a genial, summery excursion that makes the most of its star Laure Calamy, as a Parisian schoolteacher who pursues her married lover and his family on a multiday hike in the Cévennes mountains in southern France.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Facing Eviction (PBS)</p><p>While news is always in a hurry and topical documentaries are news in slow motion, the long-running current-events program \"Frontline\" has always tried to chart a middle ground, going for the head and the heart—and occasionally the throat—with urgency and alacrity. It's easier to be current, too, when the crisis in question is still going on.</p><p>\"Facing Eviction\" examines the very immediate ramifications of the housing calamity caused by Covid-19 for seemingly secure people who lost their jobs and then their homes, despite a federal ban on evictions. But in a larger sense, the show, narrated by longtime \"Frontline\" voice Will Lyman, tells a story of a nation divided by a legal system and support network far too vulnerable to bureaucratic obfuscation, and political and moral caprice.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>She Will</p><p>Low-budget horror is an excellent jumping-off point for young directors eager to make a splash, with Jordan Peele (\"Get Out,\" 2017) and Robert Eggers (\"The Witch,\" 2015) among the recent filmmakers who launched their careers with the macabre. \"She Will,\" from another first-timer, the Franco-British artist Charlotte Colbert, doesn't quite reach the same level as those films, but it's stylish and chilling, with a lively feminist undercurrent.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Ultimate Space Telescope (PBS)</p><p>With a title that suggests a '50s sci-fi movie or a '70s punk band, \"Ultimate Space Telescope\" tells the story of the James Webb Space Telescope, the most advanced, expensive, delicate and thus-far-successful instrument of cosmic exploration ever designed—or built, or sent a million miles into the stars. It's a breathless account of a long-delayed and wildly ambitious project.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Vengeance</p><p>It sometimes seems as though we are determined to drive ourselves crazy: Short attention spans, hookup culture, obsession with electronic devices and endless bickering about political differences are poisoning our humanity. B.J. Novak, the actor and writer from \"The Office,\" has made an impressive effort to shape all of these concerns, as well as other scourges such as opioid abuse, into a murder mystery in \"Vengeance,\" his spiky first film.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Blackbird (Apple TV+)</p><p>'I like you,\" says Jimmy Keene's sultry, dark-haired bar mate, leaning into him across a pair of cocktails. \"But not as much as you like yourself.\" Jimmy offers no rebuttal, which is hardly a surprise at this point in \"Black Bird\"; Jimmy (Taron Egerton) is one of those guys who can strut while sitting down. The flashback just confirms what we know about him already. The young woman—one of many anonymous brunette breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout the series—confirms what we suspect, which is that sometimes a true-crime adaptation actually deserves six parts to tell its story.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Maggie (Hulu)</p><p>One of the nicest compliments that could have been paid to \"Maggie,\" the new \"psychic comedy\" created by Maggie Mull and Justin Adler, is that it was moved to Hulu from ABC. Where would the mother network have placed a show this smartly written? Between \"Press Your Luck\" and \"Generation Gap\"? You wouldn't have had to be clairvoyant to predict a programming disaster, but Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) would have been all over it.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Wuhan Wuhan (PBS)</p><p>Watching \"Wuhan Wuhan\" while actually having Covid-19 was a novel viewing experience. I don't recommend it. The film is another matter: Shooting during the initial lockdown in the Chinese city where the virus was first detected, the gifted Canadian documentarian Yung Chang captures a general state of confusion and fear through very intimate angles, bedside perspectives and rancorous old men driving their nurses to distraction. It will all seem very familiar to those who have lived through the pandemic on this side of the world. Which is quite obviously the point.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Surface (Apple TV+)</p><p>The magnetic Gugu Mbatha-Raw (\"The Morning Show\") is the main attraction of \"Surface,\" but among her fellow executive producers is actress Reese Witherspoon, who deserves credit for embarking on what seems to be a mission, maybe even a movement: She's put her considerable clout behind a number of high-end, expansive dramatic series (\"Truth Be Told,\" \"Big Little Lies,\" \"Little Fires Everywhere\") featuring prominent actresses in female-centric stories. If they've become a bit predictable, that probably comes with the territory: In \"Surface,\" for instance, when a seemingly loving, supportive husband tells his wife what to wear to a party, he may as well have \"serial killer\" tattooed on his forehead.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Honor Society (Paramount+)</p><p>The getting-into-college sweepstakes are terrifying enough for student and parent alike that the very idea of Honor Rose (Angourie Rice) makes \"Honor Society\" something close to a horror thriller: An overachiever is one thing. One who actively undermines the competition is malignant. One who delights in her own scheming may be evil personified.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Uncoupled (Netflix)</p><p>Inciting a riot of gay clichés, \"Uncoupled\" begins with an ending—of a 17-year partnership between two men and the catapulting of one into a condom-free world of antivirals and hedonism. That the creators are Darren Star (\"Sex and the City\") and Jeffrey Richman (\"Modern Family,\" \"Desperate Housewives\") might compel the more flippant among us to dub the new show \"Gay Sex in the Gay City\" or even \"Modern Gay Family.\" But a more accurate handle would be \"Desperate Gay Sex in the Gen X City,\" considering that the delicate subject of gay men and age is the joke. And the lament.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>We Met in Virtual Reality (HBO Max)</p><p>While certainly a curiosity, \"We Met in Virtual Reality\"—a pandemic-inspired documentary filmed entirely within a social platform called VRChat—is also revelatory, if not entirely ennobling of the human condition. The \"authenticity\" of reality TV was long ago deflated, but what viewers will find in this HBO documentary, along with fantastical avatars, online romance and pandemic refugees looking for connection, is honesty: Even while embodying their \"idealized\" selves, the participants are concerned with the same interpersonal, eccentric and often banal matters that preoccupy the IRL (in-real-life) inhabitants of \"unscripted\" television. In a world made purposely unreal, there lies something genuine.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>What to Watch: The 18 Best New Movies and TV Shows From July</p>",
