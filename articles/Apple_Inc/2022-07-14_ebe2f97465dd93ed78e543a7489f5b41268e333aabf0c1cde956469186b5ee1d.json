  "title": "From Morgan Wallen to Ryan Adams, Some of Music's Disgraced Stars Stage Their Comeback; Musicians with tarnished reputations are back in the spotlight—and in some cases, are bigger than ever",
  "text": "<p>\"Ryan has had his problems, but I believe he was canceled unfairly,\" says Richard Jones, Mr. Adams's new manager, whose clients also include the Pixies. People should get a second chance to improve themselves, Mr. Jones says. \"And I genuinely believe that Ryan wants to do that, and is doing that.\"</p><p>Mr. Adams joins a growing number of disgraced music stars who are back in the spotlight. Country superstar Morgan Wallen, who wascaught last year uttering a racial slur, halting his live appearances and new recordings, apologized and is now on tour. Rapper DaBaby, criticized for homophobic comments made at last year'sRolling Loud festival, was dropped from several events and apologized; he performs at Rolling Loud again this month. Hit-making super-producer Dr. Luke was accused of rape by the pop star Kesha—an allegation he denies—prompting him to curtail production work under his own name. Now he's back in the top 10 of Billboard's singles chart with a song called \"Big Energy\" by the rapper Latto—and without the pseudonyms he has been using since the allegations.</p><p>These artists' return from cancellation is giving the music business a real-time lesson about the changing dynamics of scandals in the social-media age.</p><p>The sheer number of artist scandals nowadays dilutes their impact, says Ryan Schinman, co-founder of Mayflower Entertainment, an entertainment-marketing consulting agency. \"It's a hot topic, for a hot second, and then it's on to the next scandal,\" he says.</p><p>How easily an artist can come back is complicated and depends on their stature and the nature of the allegations against them, music executives say.</p><p>Consider Mr. Wallen, one of country music's hottest stars. After he was caught on video using the N-word in early 2021, U.S. radio stations temporarily stopped playing his music and streaming services Spotify and Apple Music removed him from several major playlists. Mr. Wallen's monthly Spotify listeners slumped that spring and summer, eventually dropping to 8.3 million from 12 million. But most fans didn't abandon him. By December, his number of monthly Spotify listeners began surging, according to music-analytics firm Chartmetric; it's now at 13.5 million. His latest album, \"Dangerous,\" finished 2021 as the most popular album in the U.S. across all genres, according to data provider Luminate. It is currently No. 4 on the Billboard album chart.</p><p>\"The people who don't like you aren't in a position to cancel you,\" says music critic Steven Hyden. \"It's the people who are fans who can really hurt you if they decide that they don't want to buy your records or go to your show anymore.\"</p><p>In interviews, several music-industry professionals privately expressed sympathy for Mr. Wallen's situation. Executives say because Mr. Wallen didn't attack someone physically, the scandal's impact was limited.</p><p>Throughout his crisis, Mr. Wallen remained on the roster of his Nashville label, Big Loud Records,though his recording contract had been temporarily suspended. Similarly, rapper DaBaby stayed with his label, Interscope.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Wallen declined to comment. A representative for DaBaby couldn't be reached.</p><p>Dr. Luke's return to the spotlight, by contrast, has occurred over many years, in part because he wasn't a huge celebrity outside of music-industry circles when his scandal erupted, music executives say.</p><p>In 2014, Kesha, who had worked with Dr. Luke on her biggest hits, including \"Tik Tok\" (2009) and \"Die Young\" (2012),sued Dr. Luke, accusing him of drugging and raping her.</p><p>The same day, he countersued for defamation and alleged breach of contract, denying the allegations and claiming she was manufacturing a scandal to get out of a contract. She has denied this. As the feud progressed, fellow musicians rallied to Kesha's side, including pop superstar Taylor Swift, who donated $250,000 to help pay Kesha's legal bills. Dr. Luke's production work stalled.</p><p>Over time, he has won more of the skirmishes in their long-running legal battle. Yet, for many music fans, his reputation hasn't recovered, executives say.</p><p>Dr. Luke has become active again as a producer and songwriter, working on big hits for artists like Doja Cat under pseudonyms such as Tyson Trax and Made in China. More recently, he returned to working as Dr. Luke. Yet some artists continue to distance themselves from him in media interviews, despite associating with him or his businesses.</p><p>A representative for Dr. Luke couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Mr. Adams, a seven-time Grammy nominee, broke out nationally in the early 2000s. For years, he was considered an alt-country bad boy, one whose unpredictable concerts could be either riveting or drunken, shambolic affairs. While he retains a loyal, sizable fan base today, he is a relatively niche artist with modest streaming numbers.</p><p>In February 2019, seven women accused Mr. Adams of various forms of sexual misconduct and emotional abuse, including the musician Phoebe Bridgers and singer and actress Mandy Moore. (Ms. Moore is Mr. Adams's ex-wife.) The allegations ranged from verbal abuse and controlling behavior to dangling professional support to female artists and in some cases retaliating when his sexual advances were spurned. The most serious allegation was that Mr. Adams engaged in sexually explicit online communications with an underage girl, which triggered an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Mr. Adams denied the allegations, while apologizing to \"anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.\" He said the picture painted of him was \"upsettingly inaccurate;\" later, he said he had \"mistreated people.\"</p><p>In the fall of 2019, the FBI closed its inquiry, having \"found no evidence of a crime,\" says Andrew Brettler, Mr. Adams's lawyer. \"Ryan was never questioned—nor did they ask to question Ryan.\" Mr. Adams and the woman reached an agreement on the issue, and she provided him with a statement that she had lied about her age, according to Corey Grimm, her lawyer. \"I continue to believe Ryan is a good human being,\" her statement said. FBI spokeswoman Amy Thoreson declined to comment. Mr. Adams declined to comment.</p><p>In the aftermath of the accusations, Mr. Adams's career imploded. He lost the support of the label that distributed his music. According to Chartmetric, between February and May 2019, his monthly Spotify listeners dropped to 1.3 million from 2 million. (They've since recovered somewhat, to 1.6 million.)</p><p>Representatives for Ms. Bridgers and Ms. Moore couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>In recent months, Mr. Adams and his team have been testing the waters and watching for signs of backlash.</p><p>This spring, the prolific singer-songwriter released two albums. In May, he played five East Coast shows, including two sold-out concerts in New York—his first public performances since the scandal broke—with total revenues of $619,000, according to Mr. Jones. That month, Mr. Adams said on Instagram that he had been sober for nine months—key for maintaining the support of Messrs. Jones and Bragman.</p><p>\"I don't want to work with Ryan if he's not sober,\" Mr. Bragman says. Mr. Adams was a real jerk when he wasn't sober, he says.</p><p>The return of canceled artists like Mr. Adams may be discouraging for some listeners, including younger ones who often hold stars to higher ethical standards than past generations did, according to Eileen Favorite, an adjunct professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>\"I hope they learned something,\" Ms. Favorite says of the artists who are making their comebacks. For 20 years, she has taught a course titled \"Love the Art, Hate the Artist.\" Over that time, her students have asked more of artists, she says. \"It's not that they want to 'cancel,'\" Ms. Favorite says. \"They want accountability.\"</p><p>In the end, the decision of whether to re-embrace such artists may be more pragmatic than moral, industry watchers say.</p><p>Major stars who are widely considered historically significant are hard to cancel because they're one-of-a-kind and have shaped the evolution of music. A young musician in pop music today \"can't not learn from Michael Jackson,\" Ms. Favorite says.</p><p>For many other musicians, however, it's the undying question: Does their music bring to mind the artist's talent—or their scandal?</p><p>\"A lot of people, they listened to Ryan Adams, and it reminded them of getting married, of falling in love—a happy time in their life,\" says Mr. Hyden, the music critic. \"Now, it makes them think about indiscretions in his personal life, and it's not enjoyable for them anymore. So maybe they don't want to listen. Whereas someone else might say, 'I don't care—I like his record so much that I just want to listen to him.' And I think both responses are valid.\"</p><p>From Morgan Wallen to Ryan Adams, Some of Music's Disgraced Stars Stage Their Comeback</p>",
