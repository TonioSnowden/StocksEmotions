  "text": "<p>Porsche SE, the family holding company that controls Volkswagen, is investing in Munich-based rocket start-up Isar Aerospace in an attempt to ensure access to new space-based technologies. </p> <p>The company is joining HV Capital and banking group Lombard Odier as new investors by injecting $75m, bringing total second-stage funding to $165m and valuing the group at an estimated $550m. </p> <p>Isar is one of several European start-ups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/096f0ae2-b487-4ddd-9338-44b088d43ce1\">attempting to rival</a> Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin with low-cost satellite launch services to low-earth orbit.</p> <p>“We are convinced that cost-effective and flexible access to space will be a key enabler for innovations in traditional industries as well as for new and disruptive technologies and business models,” said&#xa0;Lutz Meschke, the Porsche SE executive responsible for investment management.</p> <p>Existing investors include Airbus Ventures, Earlybird Venture Capital and Lakestar. In total, the group has raised $180m since its foundation in 2018.</p> <p>Isar is also set to make life more challenging for Europe's launch company, Arianespace, which has been struggling with delays to its next-generation rocket, Ariane 6. While substantially cheaper than previous generations of Ariane rockets, the latest launch version will still be more expensive than SpaceX's reusable vehicle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24cca993-b249-45a5-8c42-b39c0ec30c5b\">Arianespace</a>, jointly owned by French aerospace companies Airbus and Safran, has traditionally been the preferred service provider to European space agencies. </p> <p>But in May, Isar became the first private European company to win a contract from a national European space agency when it was awarded the mission to launch two satellites into orbit for the German government. </p> <p>Airbus, an investor in Isar since 2019, has also contracted with Isar to launch an earth observation satellite.</p> <p>Isar is targeting a launch price of $10,000 a kilogramme, still substantially higher than SpaceX. However, Daniel Metzler, one of three co-founders and Isar chief executive, said this compared with average European launch costs of more than $40,000 a kilogramme for small satellites.</p> <p>Isar is also aiming to bring down prices over time as manufacturing matures and more contracts are awarded.</p> <p>The rocket would have a payload capability of up to one tonne, capable of carrying several satellites, he said. </p> <p>Yet Isar has not sent a single satellite to space. The company began production of its Spectrum rocket this year and will soon begin engine testing in Sweden. The maiden flight is due in summer 2022 from launch operations in Norway.</p> <p>Metzler said the latest funding round would allow Isar to scale up production of the Spectrum rocket, which relies heavily on automation and 3D printing to cut production costs. The group also intended to use funds to begin development of a reusable launch vehicle.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We want to take a leadership role for reuseability in Europe,” Metzler said.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Porsche SE's investment signalled a growing realisation that space would transform traditional industries such as the automotive sector, he added. </p> <p>“A car today is more like a gadget and iPhone. They are becoming more software-centric so the question is what applications can you run on your car. </p> <p>“A satellite constellation could tell you if there is a parking spot, for example. The possibilities of space are very, very big drivers for the automotive industry.”</p><p>Source: Peggy Hollinger, International Business Editor 2021 'Porsche SE invests in European rocket launch start-up' FT.com 28 July.
