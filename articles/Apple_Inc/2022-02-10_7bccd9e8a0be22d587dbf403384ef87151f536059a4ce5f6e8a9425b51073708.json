  "title": "Sting Sells Songwriting Catalog of Solo Work and Hits by the Police; Deal with Universal Music Publishing Group fetches around $300 million",
  "text": "<p>Sting's deal is in league with other major catalog- and music-rights sales from the past couple of years. Universal, a division of Universal Music Group NV, bought Bob Dylan's publishing catalog at the end of 2020 for $300 million to $400 million, according to people familiar with the deal. It encompassed more than 600 copyrights spanning 60 years.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen sold his music rights, both his song catalog and his recorded music, to Sony Group Corp.'s Sony Music Group for between $500 million and $600 million in the largest transaction for the life's work of an individual artist, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The deal highlights how hot the market for music rights remains as a steady stream of artists has sold their catalogs in recent years. A combination of listeners' preference for older music, tax advantages for artists on their catalog sales and high valuations driven by the idea that music is a recession-proof and high-growth asset have driven the frenzy, music industry executives and lawyers say.</p><p>Sting's world-wide agreement includes global hits \"Roxanne,\" \"Every Breath You Take,\" \"Fields of Gold,\" \"Message in a Bottle,\" \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" as well as the 70-year-old's 2021 solo album \"The Bridge.\"</p><p>The deal with Universal Music Publishing Group puts Sting's publishing under the same roof as his recorded-music catalog, which has been with Universal his entire career with labels A&amp;M Records, Interscope Records and Cherrytree Records.</p><p>Having both Sting's recordings and publishing rights will allow the world's largest music company to place his work in a variety of media including biopics and other films, television shows, and commercials.</p><p>PHOTOS: From Bruce Springsteen to Tina Turner: Why Are Artists Selling Their Music Catalogs?</p><p>Revenue from streaming music has grown with the popularity of services from Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The income from streaming has been especially pronounced for classic tunes like those found in Sting's catalog, with hits finding new listeners decades after their initial release.</p><p>Music older than 18 months makes up some 70% of listeners' consumption on music streaming services, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music. Older hits are commanding higher prices than before the pandemic because they are generally perceived as safe bets based on proven longevity, and they have seen an even bigger surge in streaming during lockdowns as fans have leaned into familiar nostalgia listening.</p><p>Sting said the deal would help his body of work \"not only to connect with longtime fans in new ways, but also to introduce my songs to new audiences, musicians and generations.\"</p><p>The British-born singer-songwriter, whose legal name is Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, has sold more than 100 million albums over his career as the frontman and bassist of the Police and as a solo artist.</p><p>The new-wave rock band, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, released five studio albums between 1978 and 1983. Altogether, Sting has released 15 studio albums and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. He got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000.</p><p>Sting's older work has also re-entered pop culture, with samples by high-profile artists such as Diddy in \"I'll Be Missing You\" and JuiceWRLD in \"Lucid Dreams,\" as well as Nas, the Roots, Tupac Shakur and French Montana.</p><p>A prolific performer, Sting is slated to resume his world tour next month, followed by a Las Vegas residency at Caesars Palace in June.</p><p>Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com</p><p>Sting Sells Songwriting Catalog of Solo Work and Hits by the Police</p>",
