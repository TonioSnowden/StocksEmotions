  "text": "<p>   If California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants a \"price gouging penalty\" on oil companies' \"excess profits,\" he might want to check with his constituents in Silicon Valley first (\"Gavin Newsom's Latest Tax Increase,\" Review &amp; Outlook, Dec. 12). While Exxon Mobil's profit for the third quarter was a record-breaking $19.66 billion, it didn't match Apple's profit for its third quarter, $20.7 billion. </p><p>   I think there were many fewer people buying Apple's products than consuming products made by Exxon Mobil during the quarter. Using Mr. Newsom's logic, this would only highlight the price gouging by Apple, which is praised by so many. </p><p>   Todd Brown </p><p>    Plymouth, Mass. </p><p></p>",
