  "title": "Technology:  Apple's  App Store  Scrutinized  In U.K.  ----  By Sam Schechner",
  "text": "<p>   The U.K. is investigating Apple Inc.'s treatment of app developers that offer their wares on the company's App Store. </p><p>   The Competition and Markets Authority, the U.K.'s antitrust regulator, said Thursday that it opened an investigation into whether Apple imposes unfair or anticompetitive conditions on app developers, including requirements that some types of apps use Apple's in-app payment system, from which Apple can take commissions of up to 30%. </p><p>   The authority said it opened the investigation following complaints from developers about some of Apple's terms, such as the requirement that all apps on iPhones and iPads must be distributed through Apple's store. </p><p>   Andrea Coscelli, the regulator's chief executive, said special scrutiny is warranted for \"complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice -- potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps.\" </p><p>   Apple said it would work with the CMA and defended the requirements it places on app developers, saying they are \"applied fairly and equally to all developers\" and are necessary \"to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent.\" </p><p>   The U.K.'s investigation covers similar ground to probes the European Union opened into Apple's App Store policies in June 2020, while the U.K. was transitioning out of the bloc. The EU case could involve some of Apple's conduct in the U.K. through the end of 2020. </p><p>   Apple has said the complaints in the EU cases are baseless. </p><p></p>",
