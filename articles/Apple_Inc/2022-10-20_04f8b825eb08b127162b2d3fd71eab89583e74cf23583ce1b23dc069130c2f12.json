  "text": "<p>   TOKYO -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering expanding its production capacity in Japan, people familiar with the matter said, in what would be a move by the world's largest contract chip maker to reduce geopolitical risk. </p><p>   The Japanese government has signaled that it would like TSMC to expand in the country beyond a factory already under construction, but no decision has been made and TSMC is studying the feasibility, these people said. </p><p>   The Taiwanese company, which makes chips for a host of major electronics products, including those of Apple Inc., is building its first chip-manufacturing plant in Japan, located on the southern island of Kyushu. The multibillion-dollar plant is subsidized by the Japanese government. </p><p>   The semiconductor industry has been in upheaval since last year when widespread chip shortages snarled auto making and other industries. At the same time, the U.S. and allies such as Japan have grown concerned about the rise of the Chinese semiconductor industry and the concentration of chip making in Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. </p><p>   TSMC's factory under construction in Japan is part of the response to these issues. The plant is set to focus on less-advanced chips commonly used in autos and components like sensors, and it is scheduled to ship products in late 2024. A company called Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, majority-owned by TSMC, is building the plant. </p><p>   If it expands beyond the current plan, TSMC would look at building more-advanced chips in Kyushu, the people familiar with the matter said. A TSMC spokeswoman said the construction for the project in Japan is on track and declined to comment on possible expansion. </p><p>   An official at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry who oversees the semiconductor industry declined to comment. </p><p>   Once a world leader in semiconductor manufacturing, Japan has fallen behind Taiwan and the U.S. Tokyo officials have called that a national-security concern and sought to locate more chip making in the country to support other manufacturers such as car makers that need chips. </p><p>   Last December, Japanese lawmakers approved 774 billion yen, equivalent to $5.2 billion, in funding to rebuild the domestic semiconductor industry, part of Tokyo's goal to increase domestic chip revenue to the equivalent of nearly $100 billion by 2030, roughly triple the 2020 figure. </p><p>   The budget includes billions of dollars in subsidies for domestic cutting-edge chip manufacturing. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has said it will cover up to half of the construction cost of the TSMC factory, with the maximum commitment equivalent to $3.2 billion. </p><p>   People involved in the TSMC project said the government subsidies helped overcome drawbacks to building in Japan such as tight power supply and the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
