  "title": "PepsiCo Explores Options for Russian Business as Ukraine Crisis Deepens; Snacks and drinks giant owns a large Russian dairy business and employs 20,000 people in the country",
  "text": "<p>Revenue from PepsiCo's Russian unit was $3.4 billion in 2021, making it the third-largest market for the company after the U.S. and Mexico. The impact of writing off the Russian unit would be minimal because it contributes little to PepsiCo's earnings, some of the people said.</p><p>A growing number of Western companies have said they plan to pull out of Russia or make changes to their businesses there. Those moves came after Western governments imposed sanctions on the country in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, and financial firms took steps that could close off Russia from global markets.</p><p>On Tuesday, McDonald's Corp. said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in the country. Apple Inc. has stopped selling iPhones and other products there. Boeing Co Co. has suspended parts and maintenance support for Russian airlines. British energy giant BP PLC said it would exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian government-controlled oil producer Rosneft.</p><p>New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees one of the largest public pension funds in the U.S., wrote last week to PepsiCo, McDonald's and other companies, asking them to consider pausing or ending their operations in Russia.</p><p>PepsiCo has 20,000 employees in Russia. The company's 24 plants and three R&amp;D centers there make soft drinks, potato chips, milk, yogurt, cheese, baby food and baby formula. The bulk of its Russian business is Wimm-Bill-Dann, a dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo bought in 2011 for about $5 billion.</p><p>Officials at PepsiCo's highest levels have discussed the geopolitical crisis in the region nearly every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, some of the people familiar with the matter said. For weeks they have evaluated different scenarios of how the business may be affected by supply-chain and other financial challenges stemming from the conflict and what steps PepsiCo may need to take, one of the people said.</p><p>PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations in 2015, some of the people said. The Venezuelan unit is still operating—and PepsiCo still owns it—but it doesn't contribute to the soda-and-snack giant's earnings.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com and Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com</p><p>PepsiCo Explores Options for Russian Business as Ukraine Crisis Deepens</p>",
