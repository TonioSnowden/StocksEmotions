  "text": "<p>\"We knew within a week that we really, really liked it,\" said Ms. Becker, a Pilates instructor and personal trainer. They decided to sell their respective apartments and pool their resources to buy a Cotswolds dream house. \"It was pretty tough, because we wanted a really quintessential village, and places were just getting snapped up,\" said Ms. Becker.</p><p>At the end of 2019, just a few months before the start of the pandemic, they finally moved into a $1.04 million, four-bedroom, converted blacksmith's workshop, which they share with their red fox Labrador puppy, Bungle, in the sought-after village of Chadlington. </p><p>Cyclists take to the road in the countryside close to the village of Chadlington.

PHOTO: Vanessa Berberian for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The Cotswolds' brand of pastoral high style has been developing over the past two decades. But Covid-19 has raised its popularity to new heights, particularly the villages and towns in the north Cotswolds, which are an easy commute to London. Property prices are booming, while estate agents report dozens of would-be buyers fighting over properties and paying up to $1.36 million above list price to secure the right house. </p><p>PHOTO: JASON LEE</p><p>The rush to get out of cities is naturally one reason for these kinds of scenes. Another is the television presenter Jeremy Clarkson. Eight years ago, he bought the 1,000-acre Curdle Hill Farm, just outside Chadlington, which had been listed for $5.79 million.</p><p>Mr. Clarkson renamed the property Diddly Squat Farm, a reference to how much he knew about farming, and initially it was managed by a local farmer. In 2020, however, Mr. Clarkson took the reins and last summer, a popular Amazon Prime reality series chronicling his efforts began streaming. A second season of \"Clarkson's Farm\" has already been commissioned.</p><p>Coinciding with the TV show, Mr. Clarkson and his girlfriend, Lisa Hogan, opened a farm shop. It has attracted crowds to the rural area, leading to long traffic jams of visitors eager to purchase produce ranging from bottles of rapeseed oil ($15), to jars of preserves ($7.90), and gin infused with juniper, beetroot, apple and dill ($56). Mr. Clarkson and Ms. Hogan did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Damian Gray, regional partner at Knight Frank, credits \"Clarkson's Farm\" with strong new demand for the surrounding area. The number of new buyers registering with the firm's Oxford office, which covers the north Cotswolds, was up 65% in the three months up to August 2021 compared with the five-year average. Between June and August 2021, homes took an average of 65 days to sell, compared with 141 days in the same period in 2019.</p><p>According to Savills, the average price of Cotswolds country homes listed at $2.72 million and up increased by 23.4% during 2021, making them the \"standout\" performers of last year. The average price of homes listed at $2.72 million and up in the \"home counties\" that encircle London increased by 12.9% in the same period.</p><p>\" 'Clarkson's Farm' is referenced by almost everyone we meet in the area,\" said Mr. Gray, head of Knight Frank's central region. \"It has put the village and surrounds in the spotlight.\"</p><p>Chadlington Parish Council has raised concerns about the impact Mr. Clarkson's endeavors are having on the environment, particularly the high traffic levels. But many locals welcome the jobs and opportunity he is creating. Jewelry designer Sarah Pulvertaft, 56, has lived in the north Cotswolds hamlet of Taston for 12 years. She drives past Diddly Squat Farm on her way to her studio, which is near Charlbury, another of the north Cotswolds' popular towns.</p><p>\"There are unbelievable queues for the farm shop,\" she said. Still, she says she likes the commerce he is bringing to the area. \"He is selling locally produced produce, which I also like.\"</p><p>According to research from real-estate agents Hamptons, the average sale price of a property in the OX7 postal code, which covers the area, stood at $530,000 in 2016. By 2020, this had increased to $648,800, an uptick of 22.4%. By comparison, sale prices in Prime Central London grew 3.4% between 2016 and 2020 before falling by 0.85% between 2020 and 2021.</p><p>\"We probably would not have got our house if we were looking now,\" said Ms. Becker.</p><p>The Cotswolds were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the 1960s but the north Cotswolds came to particular national attention in 2010 when David Cameron, who represented the local Witney parliamentary constituency, was elected prime minister. Mr. Cameron, his wife, Samantha, and their well-connected neighbors became known as the \"Chipping Norton set\" in honor of one of the largest local towns.</p><p>Other high-profile local residents include Alex James. The former bass player for the band Blur and his wife, Juliet Harbutt, bought a 200-acre farm outside the nearby village of Kingham where they make cheese and, since 2011, have hosted an annual music festival.</p><p>Anthony Bamford, also known as Lord Bamford, chairman of agricultural machinery manufacturing firm JCB, and his wife, Carole, Lady Bamford, own an organic farm in the village of Daylesford. In 2001, Lady Bamford opened a small farm shop and café. The award-winning Daylesford Organic now has branches in four affluent central London neighborhoods, plus a spa beside the original shop in Daylesford, and a gastropub in Kingham, which is 2 miles up the road.</p><p>Buying agent Harry Gladwin, a partner at The Buying Solution, has been buying and selling property in the north Cotswolds for about 20 years. Back when he started, he said it was popular among academics from Oxford University, 18 miles southeast, who were looking for a country home. It also appealed to London hedge-fund millionaires with large bonuses to spend on a weekend bolt-hole. Mr. Gladwin believes that it was the 2015 opening of Soho Farmhouse, an offshoot of the private members club with a hotel, spa and private club, that really moved the area into a different gear.</p><p>\"It has created a bit of a bubble of amenities and by 2016 and 2017, it had become ultra-popular,\" he said. \"Moving to this area is not like moving to the back of beyond. You have got your creature comforts on the doorstep.\"</p><p>Buying agent Johannes Hodson said businesses such as Soho Farmhouse and Daylesford Organics have changed the profile of local buyers. \"It used to be popular with the hunting, shooting and polo set, the green Welly brigade,\" he said. \"More recently, they have been supplanted by a more trendy, fashionable buyer. There is a fun crowd here at weekends, and people who are doing well like the idea that they are joining into something which is perceived as glamorous.\"</p><p>Mr. Gladwin agrees. \"You are more likely to see a pair of funky trainers in Chipping Norton nowadays than a pair of brogues,\" he said. \"You are also more likely to hear American and overseas accents. Ten years ago, those people didn't come to this part of the world because there was nothing here for them.\"</p><p>Arrivals in the post-Soho Farmhouse era include Victoria and David Beckham, who bought a historic $8.38 million property—three historic barns converted into a single house—in the village of Great Tew, around a mile from the Soho Farmhouse, in 2016.</p><p>The uncertainties of Brexit then slowed the market in 2018 and 2019, said Mr. Gladwin, but the pandemic, and the drive to move out of cities into larger homes with more outside space, ignited the market once more.</p><p>\"We came out of the first national lockdown last May wondering what was going to happen, and we were hit with a wall of buyers coming out of London,\" he said. \"It has been totally bonkers, and actually very difficult to keep up with.\"</p><p>Competition between buyers has been \"ferocious,\" said Mr. Gladwin. When a home is listed, an average of 20 buyers will show an interest, he said, and offers of 10% above the guide price are commonplace. \"And some of the guide prices are pretty inflated in the first place,\" he said. \"There have been a number of cases where the price achieved has been £1 million above the guide price.\"</p><p>Key addresses for those currently moving to the north Cotswolds are Great Tew and its neighbor, Little Tew, said Mr. Gray. Prices for a three- or four-bedroom cottage can go up to $1.362 million. A little farther away, but still within easy reach of Soho Farmhouse, picture-postcard towns and villages such as Burford, Chadlington, and Charlbury are also seeing keen interest, said Mr. Gray. He estimated that a modest three-bedroom cottage would cost around $1.02 million while a buyer would need to budget at least $1.7 million to $2.04 million for a four- or five-bedroom house, and more for a property with land.</p><p>Strutt &amp; Parker estate agents is currently listing a five-bedroom, 2,700-square-foot farmhouse, near another popular village, Churchill. It comes with 6 acres, stables and a 750-square-foot, two-bedroom cottage, with a guide price of $3.815 million.</p><p>In Burford, estate agent Tayler &amp; Fletcher is currently listing a 2,500-square-foot house, with five bedrooms and roses around the door, with a guide price of $1.5 million.</p><p>Mr. Gray says the market for properties up to about $2.04 million is incredibly strong. \"We are seeing probably up to 30 viewings per house, and three, four, or five people making offers. As a buyer it can be terribly demoralizing,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Gray suspects that the market may start to \"cool slightly\" now that London's offices have reopened and government buying taxes, which were cut between July 2020 and September 2021 in an effort to prop up the housing market, are back in force.</p><p>Listings</p><p>Guide price: $3.06 million</p><p>This four-bedroom, three-bathroom farmhouse, with original features including beamed ceilings and an inglenook fireplace, is in the village of Milton-under-Wychwood. It measures 4,104 square feet and has a half-acre backyard. The stone-built property comes with two self-contained cottages, adding an additional 1,754 square feet of space and five more bedrooms. Agent: Strutt &amp; Parker</p><p>Guide price: $885,690</p><p>This Victorian former tweed mill in Chipping Norton has been converted into apartments. Currently listed is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home measuring 1,704 square feet. Residents share 6 acres of grounds plus amenities including a swimming pool and tennis courts.
