  "title": "The 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV review: The electric hatch is a top-rated EV under $30K; This higher and slightly longer Bolt is sufficiently zippy with a comfortable ride and 247 miles of range",
  "text": "<p>* Range and price</p><p>Cons</p><p>* All-wheel drive not available</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* Lower prices</p><p>* Redline Edition cosmetics package</p><p>The Chevy Bolt EUV is our highest-rated electric vehicle under $35,000 and a Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award winner. Pricing starts at $27,200.</p><p>The Chevrolet Bolt EUV offers 247 miles of range for a sticker price of under $30,000, plus a roomier backseat than the standard Bolt. Those are three big reasons we named it our Best Electric Car Under $35,000 this year.</p><p>All-new last year, the Chevy Bolt EUV joined the Bolt EV in the Chevrolet electric-car stable, with the U signifying utility. Rear passengers climbing out of the EV and into the EUV will appreciate the expanded legroom, however. And that's the main reason for choosing the EUV over its sibling, since they have the same drivetrain and almost the same equipment. Another difference is that the top Premier trim of this Bolt EUV is eligible for the Super Cruise hands-free driving feature.</p><p>The smaller 2023 Chevy Bolt EV is reviewed separately.</p><p>See: These cars, trucks, SUVs, minivans and EVs are best buys for 2023</p><p>2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV pricing</p><p>The 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV starts at $27,200. The Premier version starts at $31,700. The Bolt EUV isn't currently eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, but rules and requirements are set to change in 2023.</p><p>There might be some state incentives. For example, the 2022 Bolt EUV qualified for $2,000 from the California Clean Vehicle Rebate program.</p><p>For comparison, the Nissan Leaf starts at $27,400. While it does qualify for the federal tax credit, at that price the Leaf offers just 149 miles of range. You can buy a Leaf with 212 miles of range, but even after applying the full tax credit, the net cost is higher than for the Bolt EUV and its 247 miles. The Hyundai HYMTF Kona Electric is closer to $31K, and the Kia Niro EV comes in at around $40K.</p><p>Be sure to read: New electric car buying incentives kick in Jan. 1, and a lot has changed. Here's an explainer.</p><p>Before buying a new Bolt EUV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. Resale values should be sturdy.</p><p>Driving the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV</p><p>Although it's no sports car, the 2023 Bolt EUV is sufficiently zippy and great in the dart-and-brake context of city driving. Another attribute that's ideal for the in-town grind is one-pedal driving. Unless a quick stop is required, the driver doesn't have to touch the brakes quite so much. Just lift off the accelerator or press back down to get going again.</p><p>This is made possible by the Bolt EUV's Regen on Demand, with different intensities of brake energy regeneration. Clicking the shift paddle beneath the steering wheel and selecting the highest level of regeneration accesses this one-pedal trick.</p><p>During longer trips on quieter roads (and short trips on busy roads, too), the Bolt EUV rides comfortably, and the cabin is pleasantly peaceful.</p><p>Also see: 2.1 million EVs and plug-in hybrids on U.S. roads, and here's how much gas they've saved</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Being a slightly longer version of the Chevy Bolt EV (by about 6 inches) and touted as having an element of utility, the 2023 Bolt EUV doesn't exactly have impressive cargo-carrying abilities. With 16.3 cubic feet of luggage space behind the 60/40 rear seats and a maximum of 56.9 cubic feet with the seats folded, these volumes are virtually the same as the Bolt EV.</p><p>Chevy decided to make the extra space count in terms of rear legroom. This EUV has 39.2 inches of it, comparable to a typical midsize sedan, and 3 inches more than the Bolt EV.</p><p>Up front, the 2023 Bolt EUV has a tech-rich aura, thanks to an 8-inch driver information display and a 10.2-inch infotainment touchscreen. The materials are of decent quality, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel makes it easy for drivers to slide their knees under.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Chevy calls this an EUV — electric utility vehicle — because it's more elegant than saying \"compact hatchback with a raised ride height making room for a floor-mounted battery pack.\" But that's what it is.</p><p>Which is not a criticism. This approach is similar to the Nissan Leaf and Kia KR:000270 Niro EV. The Hyundai Kona Electric leans a little more toward typical SUV styling.</p><p>The Bolt EUV maximizes its small footprint with short overhangs and wheels placed as far into the corners as possible. It also adds a little utility with standard roof rails.</p><p>A Redline Edition cosmetics package is new for 2023, available with either trim level. It changes the chrome exterior elements to gloss black, while adding an exclusive design of alloy wheels — finished in black and with a red accent.</p><p>Radiant Red Tintcoat joins the list of paint choices this year.</p><p>Also read: What California's ban on gas cars could mean for you—even if you don't live there</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Dual-level charge cord This standard feature works with both 120-volt and 240-volt sources.</p><p>Super Cruise This hands-free driving system works on certain highways, adding up to more than 200,000 miles in the United States and Canada. It's easy to use and learn to trust. However, it still requires that the driver's attention be directed toward the road. Super Cruise is optional with Premier trim.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The LT trim is the most affordable new Bolt EUV. It comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, LED exterior lighting, keyless entry/start, remote start, single-zone automatic climate control, cloth upholstery, and a programmable Teen Driver key.</p><p>The infotainment system includes wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, Wi-Fi, wireless phone charging, satellite radio, USB-A port, USB-C port, and six speakers.</p><p>Driver aids are forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assistance/lane-departure warning, following distance indicator, and automatic high beams.</p><p>The Premier trim adds perforated leather seating surfaces, heated/ventilated front seats, a 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control, and rear parking sensors.</p><p>Don't miss: This couple retired 2 years ago on about $27,000 a year. Here's how that's going</p><p>Factory options</p><p>A Driver Confidence package for the LT brings blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors. This lower trim level also offers a Comfort package with a heated/leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated front seats, and an 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat. There's also a Convenience package adding leather seating surfaces, heated/ventilated front seats, and a self-dimming rearview mirror.</p><p>Options for Premier trim include the Super Cruise hands-free driving system and a Sun and Sound package consisting of a dual-pane panoramic sunroof, a 7-speaker Bose audio system, and navigation.</p><p>Read: 5 reasons you should hold off on buying an EV</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>Both versions of the 2023 Bolt EUV have an electric motor taking energy from a lithium-ion battery. It develops 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, which goes solely to the front wheels.</p><p>Maximum range is 247 miles.
