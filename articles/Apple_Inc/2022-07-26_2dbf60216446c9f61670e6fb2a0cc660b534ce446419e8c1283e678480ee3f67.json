  "title": "Stocks Take Pause Ahead of Fed --- Indexes move in tight range as investors await news on rate increase and earnings",
  "text": "<p>The Fed on Wednesday is expected to deliver another 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase as it attempts to cool soaring inflation. Markets have come under pressure this year as investors worry that the central bank's aggressive tightening will lead the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, said recent earnings reports have shown recession concerns on the rise among American companies -- though that hasn't necessarily led to big stock selloffs.</p><p>So far investors have largely brushed off disappointing earnings. Shares of S&amp;P 500 companies that missed Wall Street's forecasts have fallen 0.2% on average in the two days before their report through the two days after, according to FactSet. That compares with the five-year average of a 2.4% decline.</p><p>\"What markets want at the moment is recessionary fears to cause the Federal Reserve to back off,\" Mr. Park said. \"The idea that lots of companies are talking about recessionary fears . . . in some ways plays to that narrative, so that's why markets have been shrugging off some of the poorer earnings guidance.\"</p><p>After markets closed Monday, Walmart warned that higher prices are causing consumers to pull back, hurting the retail giant's profits for the current quarter and fiscal year. The stock fell 8.8% after hours; Target shares slumped as well.</p><p>Investors are betting the Fed will begin cutting rates next year as the economy slows.</p><p>Recession fears are being reflected in the inversion of the U.S. yield curve, which happens when shorter-dated yields such as for the two-year Treasury note are higher than for longer-dated debt such as the 10-year. That is seen by investors as a recession predictor.</p><p>Some investors have been wading into the stock market despite these recession fears, helping send the S&amp;P 500 toward its best monthly gain since October.</p><p>\"For us it's been a phenomenal time to buy companies,\" said Dev Kantesaria, founder of Valley Forge Capital. \"It's one of the top three entry points in our 15-year history.\"</p><p>The two-year Treasury yield rose to 3.035% Monday from 2.989% on Friday, while the 10-year climbed to 2.819% from 2.781%. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Earnings reports are expected this week from major technology firms including Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon.com. The results could determine whether a recent rebound in beaten-down tech shares will continue.</p><p>Some investors said they were being cautious about the recent market rebound.</p><p>\"I would not lean on a rally like the one we've seen so far as a sign that the coast is clear,\" said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management.</p><p>Tech shares were mostly lower. Alphabet slipped 39 cents, or 0.4% to $107.51. Apple fell $1.14, or 0.7%, to $152.95. Tesla shares dropped $11.43, or 1.4% to $805.30.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude prices -- the global benchmark -- rose 1.9% to $105.15 a barrel. Prices are down more than 8% this month as investors worry an economic slowdown will hit demand for crude.</p><p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1%. At midday Tuesday in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.8%, Japan's Nikkei 225 index had lost 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite had gained 0.5%.</p>",
