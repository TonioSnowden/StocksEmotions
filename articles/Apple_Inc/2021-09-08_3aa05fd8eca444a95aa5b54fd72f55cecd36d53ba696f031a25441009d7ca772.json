  "title": "Technology:  Ford Hires Away  Software Expert  For Electric Autos  ----  By Tim Higgins and Mike Colias",
  "text": "<p>   Ford Motor Co. wooed Doug Field away from Apple Inc. to bolster its own efforts to better integrate software in the automobile. </p><p>   The departure, announced by Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley, is the latest disruption to Apple's ambitions for putting a vehicle on the road and the newest example of how Tesla Inc. continues to influence a generation of car development. </p><p>   \"This is just a monumental moment in time -- a moment in time that I think we have now to really remake a 118-year-old company,\" Mr. Farley said,. </p><p>   Mr. Field joins the company as chief advanced technology and embedded-systems officer, reporting directly to the CEO. </p><p>   Apple's car project has been an object of curiosity and concern throughout the auto industry since The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 about the secret effort code-named Project Titan. </p><p>   Initially, it was believed the company was aiming to come out with an electric vehicle as soon as 2020, but Apple's ambitions were questioned as timelines slipped, the project's leadership turned over and its focus seemed to narrow to developing technology around driverless cars. </p><p>   Apple's rehiring of Mr. Field in 2018 sparked renewed excitement among some observers. By the end of last year, Apple was talking with suppliers about a car, again targeting production within a few years. Yet Apple has remained quiet about its plans. </p><p>   \"We're grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter,\" Apple said. </p><p>   Mr. Field's biggest contribution to the business of car making came at Tesla, where as engineering chief he worked to develop the Model 3 compact electric car that has fueled the Palo Alto, Calif., auto maker's profit and helped make the case that EVs are the future. </p><p>   But more than being just an electric car, the Model 3 is in many ways a super computer on wheels, developed from day one with software in mind. Those capabilities allow Tesla to change the vehicle's functions after the car has rolled out of the factory and has led many to envision cars becoming like smartphones. </p><p>   Under Mr. Farley, who became CEO a year ago, Ford aims to expand its ability to offer digital services for which customers are willing to pay extra, which he says should generate recurring revenue. </p><p></p>",
