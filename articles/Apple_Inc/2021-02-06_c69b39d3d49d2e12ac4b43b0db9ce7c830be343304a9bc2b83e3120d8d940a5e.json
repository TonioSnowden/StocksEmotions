  "title": "Gavin Francis: ‘Every action has consequences, ripple effects that change the world'",
  "text": "<p><strong>Gavin Francis, 45, graduated in medicine from Edinburgh in 1999, then spent 10 years travelling. His book </strong><em><strong>Empire Antarctica: Ice, Silence &amp; Emperor Penguins</strong></em><strong> was shortlisted for the Costa and Ondaatje prizes; </strong><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/intensive-care-gavin-francis-review\"><em><strong>Intensive Care</strong></em></a><strong>, published in January, is his account of working as a GP during the pandemic. He practises as a doctor in Edinburgh.</strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition?</strong><br>To get a trade, and see the world.</p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work?</strong><br>State school — thank goodness. Then straight into work while at university studying medicine, first as a cinema usher, then a nursing auxiliary, then an anatomy demonstrator, then a barman — the best training in learning how to be a listening doctor, and appreciating just how much plurality there is in the ways of living your life.</p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor?</strong><br>I've never had one. But role models? I could suggest roomfuls, and more appear every day.</p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you?</strong><br>Moderately, in that I bike a hundred miles a week between home and the clinic, but my resting pulse is over 60 far more often than I'd like.</p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success?</strong><br>Confidence, enthusiasm, connections and luck seem more important than either in most areas of human endeavour.</p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you?</strong><br>To one party, not at all. To the idea that politics can transform human lives for the better, very much.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess?</strong><br>A machine that sucks carbon out of the atmosphere so fast that atmospheric CO2 will promptly return to pre-industrial levels. From its twin exhausts will drip an elixir that propagates human happiness and the serum for a Covid-19 vaccine. I promise to make the plans freely available.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance?</strong><br>Owning my own home.</p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest?</strong><br>If not home, then the Isle of May, an island in the Firth of Forth, home to a handful of ornithologists, a colony of seals and hundreds of thousands of seabirds. Isolation can be very therapeutic, but I also love the city for its connections and&#xa0;possibilities. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have?</strong><br>To see a think-piece for the FT in print. And to work out my own salvation with diligence.</p> <p><strong>What drives you on?</strong><br>Curiosity, enthusiasm, awareness of my mortality, love of my kids.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far?</strong><br>My marriage.</p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>Bellicosity, arrogance, faux humility, using the last of the milk. I'm aware I'm not immune to these traits myself.</p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would he think?</strong><br>He might pause, shake his head, then say: “Well, at least you've still got your hair.” But I could tell him a thing or two. The juicy stuff that I really need to know is what my 70-year-old self will wish he could have said to my 45-year-old self. </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had?</strong><br>I lost a very fine hiking fleece on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee4d9972-b6f5-11e1-8a95-00144feabdc0\">Faroese mountainside</a>, towards the end of a long and difficult trek. I've never found one that fitted or kept me warm quite so well, and suffered a few cold nights before I got back to Tórshavn. Also, the motorbike my wife and I drove from Orkney to New Zealand was stolen and torched not long after we got back home — I&#xa0;wouldn't mind still having that, for sentimental reasons.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of&#xa0;our time?</strong><br>To find a way of creating wealth and using resources sustainably, without poisoning all of our literal and metaphorical wells.</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife?</strong><br>Absolutely — in that every action has consequences, ripple effects that change the world and the lives of others, in ever-expanding circles of influence, and will go on doing so long after we're gone. In my clinical work, I see daily proof of this — it's a great consolation.</p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score?</strong><br>I'll give myself a point for every decade I've lived so far to the full: four out of 10.</p> <p><em>“</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786898187/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1786898187&amp;linkId=494215d82ffc1099a004b90ea8f8fd50\"><em>Island Dreams: Mapping an Obsession</em></a><em>” by Gavin Francis is published by Canongate</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
