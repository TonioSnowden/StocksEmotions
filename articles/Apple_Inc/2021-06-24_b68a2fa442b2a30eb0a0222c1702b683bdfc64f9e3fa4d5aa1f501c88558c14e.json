  "text": "<p>When people talk about the work-from-home revolution, they usually discuss companies: Apple is doing this, HSBC that, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc461e5b-37c5-44f4-aaad-0406b82230f2\">EY</a> the other. But the biggest impact on society will be wrought by the biggest employer in every country, the only one whose work touches every inhabitant: the state. Once governments start working from home, countries change.</p> <p>“Reinventing government”, Bill Clinton's old mantra, has suddenly actually happened. Here's how the current White House described the future of bureaucracy in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/M-21-25.pdf\">recent report</a>: “Many [US federal] employees — more than prior to the pandemic — will engage in a mix of telework and onsite work.” It says that employees who have been teleworking can generally keep doing so. This global trend could become one of the pandemic's best legacies: cheaper capitals, happier citizens and the long-delayed arrival of digital government.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, some governments had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9116ea91-302e-4bff-b943-26a53daef51e\">extracting civil servants from overheated capitals</a>. The UK had begun sending people out of London to a set of “<a href=\"https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/02/smarter-working-in-government-hubs/\">regional hubs</a>”. South Korea moved two-thirds of its government agencies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18670195\">out of Seoul</a>. Norway put its peace-corps agency in Forde, a small town in the middle of nowhere, even by Norwegian standards. Portugal had set a target to foster teleworking for 25 per cent of its central-government employees by 2023; when the pandemic struck, it almost immediately hit 90 per cent. (I learnt this and much else chairing a <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/gov/pem/webinar-the-future-of-remote-work-in-the-public-service.htm\">webinar</a> on the topic for the OECD.)</p> <p>Bureaucracy is generally well suited to being administered from home. Once Portuguese civil servants entered their new digital co-working spaces, for example, organisational frontiers blurred and they began collaborating more. At the US Social Security Administration, the backlog of pending cases fell 11 per cent in the first six weeks of last spring's lockdown, presumably because workers weren't wasting time commuting or being distracted by colleagues and managers in the office. The French even managed to digitise arguably the core function of their state: negotiating with civil servants' trade unions. And in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9f6a3-civil-service-employee-engagement-survey-covid-19-remote-working-report-august-2020/\">2020 survey</a> of more than 20,000 Irish civil servants, 88 per cent said they felt as effective working remotely as they had in the office.</p> <p>They also liked it: 85 per cent wanted to continue teleworking “very often” or “always”. The UK's tax authority, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, expects remote work to become part of its offer to staff. That could be particularly appealing to the world's female bureaucrats, who previously often found that their careers mysteriously plateaued after they requested teleworking.</p> <p>There'll be transition costs. Governments will have to update IT systems, and staff in bucolic villages will need broadband. But once governing from home becomes permanent, the pressure on house prices, office space and commutes in many capitals will deflate. That's just what's needed in an overheated economy such as Washington DC, whose catchment area now includes six of the US's 10 richest counties. And when civil servants can live anywhere, governments can recruit nationwide and will no longer have to pay workers premiums to live in the overpriced capital. The shift would help bureaucrats who are struggling to hang on in these cities, especially as state-sector salaries in many countries have been frozen since the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Some countries can expect large psychic benefits too. Many of the provincial Britons who voted for Brexit five years ago this week resented their exclusion from unaffordable, high-skilled London. Everywhere, the dispersion of government could defang the populist line about “out-of-touch elites” in the capital.</p> <p>“Federal employees would interact — in everyday settings, whether in churches, fairs, soccer fields or community meetings — with their constituents, rather than as often happens in Washington, only with themselves,” wrote former deputy assistant secretary of defence Steven Price in 2016, when the notion of the government leaving Washington was a pipe dream.</p> <p>Migrating feds would also bring other workers with them. Research suggests that when one hundred government jobs come to an area, that helps create about 55 private-sector jobs.</p> <p>Then there's the digital government. The role model for governments should be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e84f97bc-2d79-442c-a86c-97474351253a\">Estonia</a>, a country where almost every bureaucratic task can be done online, and where a citizen never has to input the same fact twice. As the New Yorker magazine <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/estonia-the-digital-republic\">explained</a> in 2017: “Instead of having to ‘prepare' a loan application, applicants have their data — income, debt, savings — pulled from elsewhere in the system.” The same goes for medical records and so on. Contrast this with the pre-pandemic US, where, as one senior federal official admits, even getting an electronic signature on a bureaucratic document was “quite challenging”.</p> <p>One reason so many people moan about government is that every time they encounter it, they feel as if they have stepped back into 1977. It's bizarre, with hindsight, that it took a pandemic to update bureaucracy. But then, the same is true of most of the supposedly thrusting private sector.</p> <p><em>Follow Simon on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KuperSimon\"><em>@KuperSimon</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email him at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=simon.kuper@ft.com\"><em>simon.kuper@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Simon Kuper 2021 'Good things happen when governments work from home' FT.com 24 June.
