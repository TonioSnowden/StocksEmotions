  "title": "Auto File: Tesla's Split, Aptiv's Warning",
  "text": "<p>Welcome to the first Friday in August. If you are reading this, thank you! And, also: Why aren't you on vacation yet? Probably because the world is not taking a vacation, and certainly not the auto industry.</p><p>There is plenty to review today before you slide out for the weekend: Elon Musk promised a bright future as Tesla shareholders approved another stock split. Aptiv rattled investors with a gloomy outlook for the European auto sector. And the Manchin-Schumer Democratic budget plan's electric vehicles (EV) incentives keep getting smaller the more you look at them.</p><p>One quick request: We want to hear from you about what you like about the Auto File, and what could improve. Please take a minute or two to respond to this short survey here  Many thanks.</p><p>Have a great weekend! Here we go -</p><p>* Elon Musk: The Steve Jobs of Cars Elon Musk has made the Tesla annual shareholders meeting a work of performance art for years, and 2022 was no exception. Dressed entirely in black, Musk bounced on a stage set up at Tesla's Austin Gigafactory roughly 59 minutes and 55 seconds into the proceedings here and talked for more than an hour. His stand-up act has improved since his Saturday Night Live appearance. His ability to wow Tesla shareholders and make all obstacles seem to disappear here as powerful as ever. To substance: Tesla shareholders approved a 3-for-1 stock split, which of course is a matter of optics that will take the company's current $921 share price down to a seemingly more affordable $300 or so. But such splits are often treated as bullish indicators. (Speaking of bullish, the landing page for the annual meeting webcast featured an image of a Model Y with longhorns stuck to the front.)</p><p>Musk brimmed with optimism for Tesla's business, forecasting the company will build 1.5 million vehicles this year, and exit 2022 building cars at an annualized rate of 2 million vehicles a year. The object in BMW's rear view mirror is much closer than it appears.</p><p>There was more: here  Promises that “Full Self Driving” software will roll out to all North American customers, a prediction that robots and automated driving will make Tesla the most valuable company in the world (watch your back, Apple.), and a warning that the Cybertruck, when it finally appears in production form, may not have the same features, nor be as cheap, as once promised. here .), and a warning that the Cybertruck, when it finally appears in production form, may not have the same features, nor be as cheap, as once promised.</p><p>There could be another Tesla factory announced for somewhere by the end of the year, Musk said. Where? Well, he observed that he is half Canadian.</p><p>Tesla shareholders backed management on most of the proposals on the proxy - rejecting proposals to require the company to open the door to unions and deliver reports on sexual harrassment and discrimination. But a proposal to allow shareholders to nominate directors passed.</p><p>* Tesla's not-so-secret profit margin advantage \"We have the highest margins in the industry,\" Musk said to applause from shareholders Thursday.</p><p>Indeed. The company many executives in the established auto industry once expected to go bust is now a benchmark. A new report by consulting firm Accenture here  !!GFN0sa3rsbfR8OLyAw!dKkDF0GAMT6loYhHhNUlvEL4FUHHssXuXQLZkk2Yww1 kP1ul8AQx_lM52pfEI-3Vmilh4y4ILMgNix8hpEldz2CxgaIWyPl3tmo$explain s one of the reasons why: Tesla, with its direct-to-customer sales system spends about 1,200 euros ($1,226) less on sales and distribution than legacy automakers, Accenture reckons. And that advantage layers on top of higher average transaction prices, and higher volumes of sales per showroom.</p><p>This is a fat target for legacy industry executives scrambling to cut costs, and they are zeroing in. Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said last week he wants to take $2,000 a vehicle out of Ford's distribution costs – a monster number in a business where unions and managers argue over pennies of cost per vehicle. Except this discussion will be with dealers, who in the United States have powerful protections under state law. Pass the popcorn?</p><p>* Automakers dig deep for batteries and chips Once upon a time, big automakers would take weeks to pay suppliers, and would cancel orders on short notice if sales didn't hit expectations. Those days are gone.</p><p>Now, automakers are paying up front to secure semiconductors, EV battery raw materials and production capacity, agreeing to stick to orders and getting directly involved in designing chips, instead of leaving that work to suppliers.</p><p>Chip industry executives welcome the changes in behavior, not least because the pre-pandemic lack of understanding among automakers about semiconductor manufacturing made them difficult customers.</p><p>Automakers are also paying up-front to secure supplies of lithium and other battery materials. GM agreed to pay lithium producer Livent $198 million in advance for supplies. Lithium producer Albemarle boasted to investors that it has been able to renegotiate contracts at higher prices, boosting profits.</p><p>* The Inflation and EV Subsidy Reduction Act The more auto industry executives and analysts look at the complex clean vehicle subsidy machine outlined in the Senate Democrats'“Inflation Reduction Act” here  proposal, the more it looks like a detailed industrial policy that could result in a sharp reduction in the number of EVs eligible for federal purchase subsidies.</p><p>The proposals for overhauling “clean vehicle” tax credits “are designed to spur additional deployment of clean vehicles, in new and used form, to increase U.S. manufacturing…(and) address a criticism that EVs are only for the wealthy,” said Levi McAllister, a partner with the Washington, D.C. law firm Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius. McAllister points out that the proposal does not limit subsidies and other policy support to electric vehicles, but includes hybrids (good for Toyota) and hydrogen vehicles (good for fuel cell and electric truck maker Nikola as well as Daimler Trucks and other commercial vehicle makers going big on hydrogen.)</p><p>A major part of the industrial policy impact of the proposal is contained in requirements that before 2024 at least 40% of the minerals used in an EV's battery come from North America or a country with which the United States has a trade agreement, and at least 50% of the manufacturing be done in North America. The percentages rise from there. By December 2028, only batteries assembled in North America with minerals 80% sourced from North America or friendly nations would qualify for the full $7,500 credit.</p><p>A Congressional Budget Office estimate suggests that only about 11,000 vehicles would qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit in 2023. In 2031, the CBO estimates the government will shell out just $1.43 billion for clean vehicle credits - good for just under 191,000 vehicles at the full rate. That would be a small fraction of the projected total number of EVs sold in the United States if the Biden administration's goal of having half the new vehicle market go electric by 2030 is achieved.</p><p>Warren Browne of RFQ Insights, who forecasts North American production, said he expects no manufacturer's vehicles will qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit next year. At best, he said, some may clear the domestic content requirements for battery manufacturing and allow customers to get a $3,750 tax credit – if they earn less than $300,000 per household, or $150,000 for an individual (another new criteria in the Democratic plan.)</p><p>Nonetheless, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Thursday joined the president to endorse passage of the proposal. Elon Musk tweeted: “Thank goodness for Senator Manchin.” here  tweeted: “Thank goodness for Senator Manchin.”</p><p>GM and Tesla get nothing under the current EV subsidy scheme - and both have invested heavily in domestic battery production. They could be winners if the proposal becomes law - and they both would welcome anything that trips up non-U.S. EV manufacturers or rivals dependent on foreign batteries.</p><p>And when it comes to federal budget policy, tomorrow is always another day.</p><p>* You might get to keep your catalytic converter: Palladium prices are falling. Sky-high prices for platinum and palladium used in exhaust scrubbing catalytic converters have encouraged thieves to hack-saw the devices out of cars. Good news: Now commodities analysts are predicting prices for these metals will fall as the global economy slows.</p><p>* Shenzhen slices the AV liability knot In Shenzhen, a city of 18 million adjacent to Hong Kong, automated vehicle deployment is expanding in part because officials have come up with a framework for sorting out liability in accidents where a robot-driven vehicle is involved.</p><p>If the AV has a human driver behind the wheel when an accident happens, the driver is responsible. If only the robot is driving, the vehicle owner is liable. If a defect causes an accident, the owner can seek compensation from the manufacturer. Americans and Europeans worried about China taking a lead in AV development should be.</p><p>* China Rising: Part Two On the subject of China, Breakingviews cautions that Western automakers, such as Stellantis, worried about the Chinese government meddling in their affairs should really be concerned that Chinese domestic automakers now own more than half of the world's largest market.</p><p>“Foreign automakers last year saw their collective share of the Chinese car market shrink by 5.5 percentage points here  to 45.6%,” write Pete Sweeney and Neil Unmack.</p><p>* SUVs power Mahindra Indian automaker Mahindra said demand for new SUVs and other vehicles is outrunning its ability to build them. The company reported strong profits, and said it was expanding capacity.</p><p>* The Bad Results Roundup: Aptiv This week produced some rough financial results. One of the most significant underperformers was automotive technology supplier Aptiv, which cut its full-year outlook and warned that vehicle production in Europe is going to drop by 5% for the full year, not rise 10% as once forecast.</p><p>“The reality is there are OEMs who have raised significant concerns as it relates to their outlook on the European macro situation and the impact on vehicle production,” Aptiv CEO Kevin Clark told analysts Thursday.</p><p>* The Bad Results Roundup: Toyota Toyota said profits for the April-June quarter fell by 42% as supply chain snafus forced a series of production cuts. The tumble was far worse than analysts had expected. “Extremely bad,” is how one analyst put it. Toyota put on a brave face, saying it still expects to build 9.7 million vehicles for the full fiscal year, and achieve its operating profit goals. Click your heels together and say, “Second half recovery, second half recovery, second half recovery.”</p><p>* The Bad Results Roundup: Lucid Next in the Bad Earnings Surprise parade comes electric luxury vehicle startup Lucid, which slashed its production forecast for the year by half, to just 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles.</p><p>Chief Executive Peter Rawlinson said Lucid has 37,000 orders for its vehicles, and $4.6 billion in the bank. Still, Lucid shares buckled, dropping about 10%. Elon Musk, for whom Rawlinson once worked, did not resist the temptation to give his rival a kick. “I had more kids in Q2 than they made cars!” Musk tweeted. here , for whom Rawlinson once worked, did not resist the temptation to give his rival a kick. “I had more kids in Q2 than they made cars!” Musk tweeted.</p><p>* Carvana gets a bounce Online used car retailer Carvana's shares bounced up here  after it reported a 16% increase in Q2 revenue compared to a year earlier. The company lost $439 million and remains a “long way” from its $3,000/vehicle goal for overhead costs. CEO Ernie Garcia has already outlined plans to cut SG&amp;A (selling, general and administrative) costs. Still, Carvana shares are down nearly 86% for the year, making it one of the big losers in the washout of pandemic-darling stocks. * Essential Reading</p><p>Could banks give Elon Musk an escape from Twitter?</p><p>The cars and trucks Americans steal most. here </p><p>AV trucking startup TuSimple and the fallout from one accident. here  and the fallout from one accident.</p><p>Auto File is published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
