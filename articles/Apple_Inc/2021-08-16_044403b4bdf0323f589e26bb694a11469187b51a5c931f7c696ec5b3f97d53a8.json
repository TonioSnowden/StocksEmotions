It's only just starting to bite. Imagine if oil went up from $20 per barrel to $200 per barrel, then that would be tantamount to what's happening now.”</p> <p>The anguish of one UK freight company highlights the pain felt by exporters and importers as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1263950-1173-4832-a011-ada04df1e93c\">soaring shipping costs</a> throw global supply chains into turmoil. As we report today, the price of moving a 40ft container from China to the US west coast has jumped to almost $16,000 — a tenfold increase on pre-pandemic levels and up by half on last month.</p> <p>The rise in costs and bottlenecks at ports — made worse by Covid-based closures of key Chinese facilities — have added to existing problems such as the global <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8b010053-6a9c-4c39-be1e-28856e47b874\">semiconductor shortage</a> and rising prices of raw materials.</p> <p>Supply chain pressures are already starting to show up in macroeconomic statistics. In Europe they were noticeable in weak industrial production figures over the summer, while in China, new data this morning showed export growth, a big driver of the country's recovery over the past year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a2c4ac6-7e01-46d6-93d4-0e83ee2f1d0e\">slowed to 9 per cent year on year</a>, compared with 32 per cent in June.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ports meanwhile are facing their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10e71eff-e59c-46fb-a9aa-a480bc86c093\">biggest crisis</a> since the start of container shipping 65 years ago, with hundreds of vessels lined up outside terminals waiting to dock. Operators are already under pressure to upgrade their facilities with bigger cranes and deeper docks to cater for the new generation of super ships as well as adapting for changes in consumer behaviour such as the demand for next-day deliveries.</p> <p>It can be difficult to assess how much of the surge in shipping costs is due to demand-led factors and how much to the supply side, wrote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb91e0e4-7021-4246-b0a1-160c52a8cca4\">Claire Jones</a> in a recent FT Alphaville column, while remedies such as building more ships will take years to have any effect. The result, she says, “is that it's hard to see costs falling back to pre-pandemic levels until Chinese new year 2022 at the earliest — the next period when you'd expect cyclical demand to ebb — and, more likely, not for years beyond that”.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p><strong>Japan</strong>, the world's fourth-largest economy, has been slower to bounce back from pandemic lows than its peers. It's now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a43557d-4c78-45cc-9fc8-4febed331b97\">edged back to growth</a> in the second quarter as output expanded 0.3 per cent after a 0.9 per cent drop in the first. However, economists warned that a rise in Covid cases could lead to a contraction in the third quarter. </p> <p>The number of permanent <strong>vacancies in the UK</strong> in July rose by 43 per cent, and for contract jobs by 53 per cent, according to a new survey, pointing to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/532cdbc2-b86f-4944-9fac-ec8d99654446\">tightening in the labour market</a>. Worker shortages in England should ease from today as employees will no longer have to self-isolate if “pinged” by the NHS Test and Trace app, a change described by the Federation of Small Businesses as “a huge relief to small businesses which have lost badly needed trade through forced closures or restricted operations”.</p> <p>Political repercussions from governments' handling of the pandemic continue. <strong>Malaysia's </strong>prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin quit today after less than 18 months in post as coronavirus cases per day passed 20,000 — the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/918df262-1627-4457-923a-44e0d3c0058b#post-21b39441-057d-4caf-918f-b164e7d06ea5\">highest since the pandemic began</a>. <strong>Canada</strong> by contrast will hold a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97fc8689-e868-4cc9-bf67-b878a88db3cc\">snap general election</a> on September 20 as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tries to capitalise on a successful vaccination programme. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>The row between the pharma industry and health officials over <strong>vaccine patents</strong> is intensifying as poor countries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf12e1ba-ee25-4a0a-870d-53f5b66b0996\">struggle to get the shots they need</a>. Pfizer boss Albert Bourla told the FT that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97c597dc-03b1-4ece-a302-f9793698ded6\">shortage of ingredients</a>, not patents, was the main drag on global supplies. Here's our short film on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0BuCt2vtVjc\">vaccine economics</a>. </p> <p>US hotel group Hyatt has agreed to buy resorts operator <strong>Apple Leisure Group</strong> for $2.7bn, increasing its share in the luxury sector which has proved relatively <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c74d112-8cb5-4732-b45b-90cf0015cf25\">resilient during the pandemic</a>. In the UK, <strong>holiday vouchers</strong> are among the incentives on offer from companies to persuade more young people <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93dc042a-f43c-447b-a2e9-6171dc23d8d9\">to get vaccinated</a>. </p> <p>As earnings season comes to a close, it is clear that <strong>banks</strong> in the US and Europe are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c10e680-0cb0-4b78-9baa-ec3807f5780b\">close to “business as normal”</a>. Investment banking revenues have surged while many provisions for loan losses have not been needed. Stress tests in Europe have also shown that large lenders have sufficient reserve capital to ward off pandemic after-effects.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>The accelerating US recovery is driving huge demand for <strong>fossil fuels</strong> as drivers return to the roads, and industry turns away from expensive natural gas for power generation and back to coal. But what does this mean for the government's goal of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65a310a6-54f6-40d5-aaa8-661106aa0f93\">halving emissions</a> (from 2005 levels) by the end of the decade?</p> <p>China's expansion of coal-powered <strong>steel mills</strong> accelerated in the first half of 2021, according to a new report, jeopardising its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4c79efb-9a4e-4f22-a75a-6b3ea3161bf1\">carbon emissions</a> goals. The surge in prices of <strong>iron ore</strong> for steelmaking has given a huge boost to mining towns such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/118ee8d5-12aa-47ce-b055-d3c59c124ac2\">Itabirito in Brazil</a>. </p> <p>Despite a few missteps, the <strong>hedge fund industry</strong> did well out of last year's market turmoil and enjoyed its best returns since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, as our Big Read explains. Some investors however believe that factors such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c87d52b2-d54e-4dae-9b50-98ca1e6c1d4c\">unjustifiably high fees</a> could mean the revival is shortlived.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Cesira </em>comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef6c975b-91f4-4328-8466-70b686f7309d?commentID=465a5c3f-509d-46ba-840b-6e997c339bbf\">Unpaid rent: the £6.4bn dispute that will shape the UK high street</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>There are many implications for tax receipts, a subject altogether ignored. I was struck by the oddity of offshored (tax-avoiding) landlords arguing with offshored (tax avoiding) businesses in central London expecting the government to whom they pay no tax to provide them with services. Quite frankly, such situations make me think it would be best to withdraw all public services (fire, police, etc) from entities who are structured to avoid paying for them.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>“It's like retreating into your own private world, one with its own cadence and rhythm, always unforgettable, more so in the middle of a pandemic.” Former FT editor Lionel Barber extols the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35e7d9f3-fb5c-4adb-a653-e486dca7d81b\">joy of cycling</a> in the latest part of our FT Globetrotter series.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Surging shipping prices and bottlenecks threaten global recovery' FT.com 16 August.
