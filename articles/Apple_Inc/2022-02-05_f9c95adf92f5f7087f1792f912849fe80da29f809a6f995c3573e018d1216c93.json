  "text": "<p>The post-earnings price drop may well be overdone, setting up an extraordinary buying opportunity for long-term investors who think CEO Mark Zuckerberg is taking the company in the right direction.</p><p>Below is a comparison of financial performance for Meta Platforms Inc. FB — Facebook's holding company — and three other companies in the S&amp;P 500 SPX. It is a special group, and Meta's stock is, by far, the cheapest of the bunch.</p><p>Shares of Meta Platforms were down 26% on Feb. 3 after the company reported a decline in fourth-quarter profit from a year earlier. Sales rose 20%.</p><p>Meta also disappointed investors by predicting its first-quarter sales would range from $27 billion to $29 billion, when analysts had been predicting $30.2 billion. The company's advertising business is in transition, in part, because of changes in privacy settings for users of Apple Inc.'s AAPL iPhones.</p><p>Read:Facebook stands to shed more than $200 billion in market value after rough earnings report</p><p>We're not even halfway through the first quarter, so let's focus for a moment on what Meta reported for the fourth quarter. Sales came in at $33.67 billion and were up 19.9% from $28.07 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. That's impressive revenue growth. But how does it measure up?</p><p>It turns out that if we look back 10 years — 40 quarters — Meta's (or Facebook's) minimum year-over-year increase in quarterly sales has been 10.7%.</p><p>That is remarkably consistent performance. Among the S&amp;P 500 SPX, only three other companies have achieved double-digit year-over-year sales growth every reported quarter over the past 10 years. Here they are, sorted by minimum sales growth for that period:</p><p> Company                      Ticker  Minimum increase in quarterly sales  Maximum increase in quarterly sales  Mean increase in quarterly sales  Median increase in quarterly sales  Date of most recent financial report available  Salesforce.com, Inc.         &#xa0;CRM&#xa0;   19.9%                                38.3%                                28.5%                             26.6%                               10/31/2021  Amazon.com Inc.              &#xa0;AMZN&#xa0;  14.6%                                43.9%                                27.2%                             23.8%                               09/30/2021  Fortinet Inc.                &#xa0;FTNT&#xa0;  13.5%                                37.0%                                23.1%                             21.9%                               09/30/2021  Meta Platforms Inc.

The mean is what most people call the “average,” or the sum of the numbers divided by the number of periods. The median is the quarterly sales increase in the middle of the group of 40.</p><p>Before digging into profit margins, check out the forward price-to-earnings ratios for the four companies as of the close on Feb. 2 — before Meta's shares took a dive:</p><p> Company                      Ticker  Forward P/E  Closing price – Feb. 2  Consensus EPS estimate – next 12 months  Meta Platforms Inc.

And it compares to a forward P/E of 20.4 for the S&amp;P 500, which is expected to increase sales by only 7.7% this year, based on weighted aggregate estimates among analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Profit margins</p><p>Investors were obviously upset that Meta's net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was down 8% from a year earlier. (Earnings per share were down 5%.) But a look at three profit margins sheds a bit more light on what has been going on:</p><p>Net income margin</p><p>Meta's net income margin (net income divided by sales) for the fourth quarter was 30.55%. That was down from 39.97% a year earlier. But it compared more favorably to 31.69% in the third quarter of 2021. The net income margin has been significantly lower before — during the first two quarters of 2020, which was understandable for the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, but also during all four quarters of 2015. That said, earnings and net interest margins may be relatively low at Meta for a long period, as the company's expenses have risen across the board.</p><p>Fourth-quarter expenses (excluding taxes) were up 38% from a year earlier. Meta CFO David Wehner said during the earnings call on Feb. 2 that higher expenses were “driven primarily by Reality Labs hardware costs, core infrastructure investments and payments to partners.” Reality Labs is Meta's virtual reality unit, which includes Oculus VR equipment and is a critical component of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's long-term “metaverse” strategy.</p><p>Read: Meta CFO cries ‘wolf' again with bleak Facebook outlook — but he may be right this time</p><p>Taxes were up considerably, with an income-tax rate of 19%. Wehner said the income tax rate for all of 2022 was expected to be “similar” to the 17% in 2021, which was up from 12% in 2020. That's painful. Then again, the fourth-quarter income-tax provision of $2.42 billion was 7.2% of sales, up from 6.5% a year earlier. The higher tax rate might turn out to be a relatively small item, when compared with Meta's increased “metaverse” development spending.</p><p>This table shows the past five reported quarters' net income margins. The columns are marked “Q” for the most recent quarter, then “Q-1” for the previous one and so on, because the most recent quarter-end for Meta was Dec. 31, while the most recent quarter ends were Sept. 30 for Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Fortinet Inc. FTNT, and Oct. 31 for Salesforce.com Inc. CRM.</p><p> Company                       Ticker  Net income margin – Q  Net income margin – Q-1  Net income margin – Q-2  Net income margin – Q-3  Net income margin – Q-4  Meta Platforms Inc.

It reflects a company's pricing power and its direct production costs, including labor and materials.

This may be worthwhile depending on the competitive environment, but it cannot go on forever.
