  "text": "<p>Bruno Le Maire is both right and wrong (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dde19dbd-80fe-4bda-95a8-55cf38ebfa82\">Report</a>, July 8) when expressing that EU debt rules for member states are obsolete and a “new economic model” has emerged. He is wrong in advocating the “new economic model” emerged from the pandemic. It is a compromise after decades of failed allocation of debt-financed spending that have so far not generated gross domestic product growth equal or in excess of the debt level.</p> <p>He is wrong in making a flawed reference to the Dutch and Germans who spend just as much on protecting their citizens, as one must also look at the ability to repay excess debt-financed government spending. In fact, it is flawed and wrong to advocate for protecting your citizens if the government debt level becomes unsustainable. It is inflationary in itself and limits the ability to protect the country's sovereignty.</p> <p>He is wrong in advocating for the need to increase debt to finance green investments, as there are alternatives to the state to make these investments, assuming the prospects are attractive.</p> <p>He is wrong that the debt rules in the Growth and the Stability Pact have been suspended during the pandemic and until 2023. The rules have never been invoked, at least not to the degree the competition rules have for companies like Google, Amazon and Apple. Therefore, it has been possible for debt levels in southern Europe to balloon to levels that seem unsustainable. He is right because a democracy is for the majority and the majority is presumably not willing to waive benefits gained over the years.</p> <p>There are measures that could postpone the obvious outcome. One is the “new economic model” or common EU debt, with reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, I would assume a slogan to northern Europe that it will only cost you a cup of coffee a day for France to retire at 60. That will not resonate well even with the least sophisticated voter.</p> <p>No painless options exist. The euro and thus the EU are caught in a death spiral. The time when everything was possible is running out and future action must be anchored to reality.</p> <p><strong>Glenn Nielsen</strong> <br><em>Copenhagen, Denmark</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Le Maire is misguided over the EU's debt rules' FT.com 15 July.
