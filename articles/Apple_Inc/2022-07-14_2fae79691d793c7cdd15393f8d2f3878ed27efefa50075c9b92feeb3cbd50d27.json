  "title": "Suspended Over a Vermont Stream, a House That Resembles a Bridge Asks $17.5 Million; The roughly 140-feet-long by 20-feet-wide Stowe home sits above a stream that is fed by a small waterfall",
  "text": "<p>PHOTO: Jason Lee</p><p>Their architect, Jim Strasman of Strasman Architects, said he had another idea once he saw a stream running through the site: Build a house that bridged the creek so the Connachers could enjoy the views and sound of running water.</p><p>The resulting house, located in Stowe and completed in 1994, is about 140-feet long by about 20-feet wide with vaulted ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. Suspended over a stream fed by a small waterfall, the roughly 4,800-square-foot structure resembles the covered wooden bridges that are prevalent throughout parts of New England. \"This is a covered bridge in its own way,\" said Mr. Connacher, 85, a retired investment banker in Toronto.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you like best about this bridge-like home? Join the conversation below.</p><p>For years, the Connachers and their four sons used the Stowe house as a vacation spot, but it is now hitting the market for $17.5 million, said listing agent Wade Weathers of LandVest, who is marketing the property with colleague Meg Kauffman. Mr. Connacher said he is reluctant to part with the property, but Mrs. Connacher, 84, has health problems that have limited her travel.</p><p>Mr. Connacher said the family began visiting Vermont to ski when their children were young, driving eight hours from Toronto in a Volkswagen van. \"We took out the middle seat and we put a card table in,\" Mr. Connacher recalled. \"The kids sat around the card table and played games and we just prayed to God we didn't get killed.\"</p><p>Starting in the 1970s, they pieced together approximately 240 acres in Stowe for under $400,000, records show. At first, they built a wood-frame house with four bedrooms that was their summer home for nearly two decades, Mr. Connacher said. After the bridge house was complete, the Connachers stayed there during vacations. For the past few years, one of the Connachers' sons and his wife have lived in the original frame house full time.</p><p>Mr. Strasman, the architect, was hired to design the bridge house after working on the Connachers' modern Toronto home, which the couple sold a few years ago. He said the Vermont site influenced his design. \"It isn't that you design bridge houses; you're trying to solve a problem that the site presents,\" he said.</p><p>When local builders balked at suspending the house over the water, Mr. Strasman said the Connachers had the trusses and deck—what became the floor that is suspended over the stream—fabricated in Quebec and trucked to Vermont. Local workers completed the rest.</p><p>The entrance to the home, consisting of glass walls and a slate floor, features a spiral staircase that leads to the bridge level. Upstairs, the kitchen and living room is one linear space, anchored by a large slate fireplace. Behind it, there is an enclosed sunroom. On each side of the house, glass windows and doors open to wooden decks and trusses that span the length of the home. Additional trusses inside the house support a pitched roof and 18½-foot-high ceilings. The lower level houses two bedrooms and an office.</p><p>Mr. Connacher said before building the house, he and his wife spent about two years traveling around Vermont, talking to builders and commissioning custom furniture, which is included in the sale. They also sourced local building materials, including slate from quarries in Southern Vermont. As part of the project, Mr. Connacher said he significantly expanded the stream under the house, lining it with boulders from one such quarry.</p><p>Mr. Connacher said construction took about a year and cost approximately $1 million.</p><p>In addition to the frame house and bridge house, the property has several outbuildings, including a workshop with a one-bedroom apartment upstairs and a four-bay equipment shed. Mr. Connacher said they have a snowmobile and two John Deere Gators, off-road vehicles, to get around the property. There is also a tennis court and five ponds, including one for swimming that has a dock, cookout area and gazebo.</p><p>Mr. Connacher said that from his house he can see an apple orchard on the property that has about 35 trees. The family often made apple cider with rum, he said. Over the years, he said his son and daughter-in-law have also created bike trails that crisscross the property. Native wildlife include beaver, duck and, recently, blue heron.</p><p>Stowe, a popular ski destination, is located in northern Vermont, about 40 miles from Burlington and a two-hour drive from Montreal, Canada.</p><p>The median sale price in Stowe is $1.4 million, said Ms. Kauffman of LandVest, and there are fewer than 30 homes currently for sale. Last year, a property on approximately 185 acres sold for about $33.7 million, according to the multiple listing service.</p><p>Mr. Weathers said Stowe has been gaining popularity in recent years, spurred by Vail Resorts' purchase of Stowe Mountain Resort. Like other places, Stowe experienced a surge in home buying during the pandemic. The town is a roughly 50-50 mix of full-time residents and second-home owners, said Ms. Kauffman.</p><p>Write to E.B.
