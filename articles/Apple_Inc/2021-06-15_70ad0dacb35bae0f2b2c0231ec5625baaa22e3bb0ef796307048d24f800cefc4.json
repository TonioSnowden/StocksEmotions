  "title": "S&P, Nasdaq Rise to Records, but Dow Loses Ground",
  "text": "<p>Shares of Tesla, Facebook, Amazon.com and Netflix all gained more than 1%, while Apple added more than 2%, helping the Nasdaq notch its sixth advance out of the last seven trading sessions and its first record since April 26.</p><p>\"Stock markets are by and large around all-time highs. We think there is still more upside there,\" said Salman Baig, multiasset investment manager at Unigestion.</p><p>Other risk-on assets also rallied, including meme-stock AMC Entertainment Holdings. Crypto assets also got a boost after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk reopened the possibility of the electric car maker accepting bitcoin for purchases.</p><p>The gains came at the expense of reopening stocks, the primary beneficiaries of a booming economic rebound that has been under way since the U.S. began rolling out Covid-19 vaccines last fall.</p><p>Despite the latest market moves, the debate between growth and cyclical stocks continues. Some investors say the market's path forward hinges on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's latest two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday.</p><p>Although most investors expect the central bank to keep rates where they are, attention will center on the Fed's view of inflation and whether it sees any need to accelerate its timetable of future interest-rate increases.</p><p>Such a move would likely inject a fresh round of volatility into markets, especially growth stocks, which are sensitive to rates.</p><p>\"The Fed's messaging this year will be critical,\" Glenmede strategists said in a note. \"The Fed needs to convey its intention to wind down ultra-accommodative policy, but at the same time, convey that it has no intention of abruptly tightening policy, a fine line that could easily be miscommunicated.\"</p><p>Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management added that the pullback in bond yields is likely temporary, cautioning investors from rushing back into tech and other growth stocks. Already on Monday, bond yields climbed, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury nearing 1.5% again.</p><p>The move up in yields didn't seem to faze investors. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 added 7.71 points, or 0.2%, to 4255.15, notching its 29th record of the year. The Nasdaq rose 104.72 points, or 0.7%, to 14174.14, its highest closing level ever.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, slid 85.85 points, or 0.2%, to 34393.75, as the benchmark suffered from its more cyclical bent.</p><p>Financial and material stocks in the S&amp;P 500 both fell at least 1%. Shares of manufacturers fared little better, declining 0.5%. Stocks popular with the reopening trade were among the hardest hit, with Carnival shedding $1.18, or 3.9%, to $28.75, while Caesars Entertainment fell $3.69, or 3.3%, to $106.62.</p><p>That was more than offset by stocks like Apple, which added $3.13, or 2.5%, to $130.48, and Tesla, up $7.80, or 1.3%, to $617.69.</p><p>Among meme stocks, AMC rallied $7.60, or 15%, to $57. And Bitcoin prices briefly rose above $40,000 for the first time in two weeks following Mr. Musk's comments. The cryptocurrency ended the day at $39,809.27, up $979.19 or 2.5% from Sunday.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.2%, hitting a record. Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.1% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.8%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.1%.</p>",
