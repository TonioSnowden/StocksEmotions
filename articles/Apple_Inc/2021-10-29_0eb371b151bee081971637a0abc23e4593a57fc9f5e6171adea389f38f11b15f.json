The 4,560 level in the S&amp;P 500 futures is a critical pivot point for today's trading which will determine which way we go,” Jakobsen said.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Apple and Amazon are struggling, so investors may want to look to these tech stocks instead</p><p>Rising bond yields were also a focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up 3 basis points to 1.610%. That follows the biggest one-day yield rise since Oct. 19 on Thursday, which snapped a four-day slide.</p><p>Traders have been factoring in expectations for tighter Federal Reserve monetary policy as debt yield curves flatten across the globe. Many expect the Fed will announce a plan next week for tapering its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.</p><p>Markets largely brushed aside European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's attempt on Thursday to push back against rising market expectations for policy interest rate increases by the end of next year.</p><p>In U.S. economic data, a report on personal incomes and spending showed that personal income slumped 1% in September after a 0.2% gain in the prior month, while consumer spending rose 0.6%. Economists were looking for a 0.4% decline in personal income and spending came in line with expectations.</p><p>In other data, the University of Michigan October consumer-sentiment index will be released at 10 a.m.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Chevron Inc. CVX rose after the energy giant reported third-quarter profit and revenue that soundly beat forecasts, on surging crude oil and natural gas prices nearly quadrupled</p><p>Shares of Western Digital Corp.WDCwere in focusafter disappointing profit guidance from the disk-drive and flash memory chip group.</p><p>Stock in Starbucks Corp.SBUX was headed lower after the coffee giant's fourth-quarter sales growth slowed, falling short of the company and Wall Street's expectations.</p><p>Shares of Meta Materials Inc.&#xa0;MMAT,&#xa0;a Nova Scotia-based material-science company, rose 5% on the heels of a 5% gain during the regular session following Facebook Inc.'sFB announcement that it was changing its name to Meta.</p><p>Zendesk Inc. shares ZEN slid 21% after the customer-service platform said it would buy Momentive Global Inc.MNTV, the parent company of online questionnaire platform SurveyMonkey in a $4.13 billion stock deal.
