  "text": "<p>   Peggy Noonan makes cogent observations in \"A Week in the Life of a Worried Land\" (Declarations, Oct. 22). But her contention that the \"mainstream media\" leaned leftward as a reaction to Donald Trump has it backward. Mr. Trump became a serious player with conservative, middle-class America as a reaction to the leftward bias of the U.S. media and culture, not the other way around. </p><p>   Talk radio and Fox News were reactions, too. None of them, including Mr. Trump, would have become the phenomena they are if those \"in charge\" had played things straight down the middle, and continued to differentiate news from opinion. </p><p>   Patrick G. Brown </p><p>   Orlando, Fla. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   When major media outlets discovered that coverage of Mr. Trump gave them more viewers, readers, listeners and clicks, they poured it on during the months and years ahead of the 2016 election, fueling his campaign. </p><p>   Then, when he won, many outlets regretted that they had helped elect a public menace and felt an obligation to fully report when he undercut public-health authorities, bent the law and sowed electoral mistrust. Ms. Noonan is right about the erosion of media credibility, but facts are still facts. </p><p>   Steve Vogel </p><p>   Bloomington, Ill. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Noonan ponders in her column why so many Republicans were (and are) open to former President Trump's claim that the 2020 election was stolen. She offers a list of contributing factors, among them \"orneriness\" and \"conspiracism.\" But something more concrete is missing, which directly preceded the civics fiasco of 2020. </p><p>   As late as 2019, Hillary Clinton said on prime-time television that Mr. Trump was \"an illegitimate president\" and that the 2016 election \"wasn't on the level\" due to such \"tactics\" as \"suppression\" and \"hacking.\" At an \"Evening with the Clintons\" event that same year, Mrs. Clinton said, \"You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.\" That same year, former President Jimmy Carter said Mr. Trump \"lost the [2016] election\" and was \"put into office\" by Russian interference. </p><p>   This was singular, toxic talk from eminences of the Democratic Party, and it rippled outward to iPhones and flatscreens across America. How could it not have contributed to what we witnessed the very next year -- distrust in our electoral system and an instinct to deny defeat rather than accept a result for the greater good? </p><p>   David S. Clancy </p><p>   Concord, Mass. </p><p></p>",
