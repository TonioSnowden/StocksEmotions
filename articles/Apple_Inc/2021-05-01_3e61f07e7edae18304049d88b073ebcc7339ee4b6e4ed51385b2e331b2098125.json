  "title": "Apple Is Hit With Antitrust Charges In EU --- Case alleges company squeezed rival music apps by forcing use of its payments system",
  "text": "<p>In addition, EU regulators say Apple \"distorted competition\" by limiting how app developers can inform users about cheaper ways to subscribe outside the app. Apple's in-app payment system imposes a 30% commission on purchases inside many of the most popular apps.</p><p>\"This case is about the central role of app stores in the digital economy,\" Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition enforcement at the European Commission, said Friday. \"An app store can become a gatekeeper, in particular if there is only one app store available in a mobile ecosystem.\"</p><p>In response, Apple took aim at Spotify, saying the company has been successful, even after it removed paid subscriptions from its iOS app in order to avoid Apple's fees. \"At the core of this case is Spotify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows,\" an Apple spokesman said. \"The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition.\"</p><p>In the past, Apple has defended its practice of taking a cut of some sales through the App Store and said it wants competing apps to thrive.</p><p>App developers have become outspoken against Apple over its App Store fees. Next week, a federal court in the U.S. will hear a lawsuit from Epic Games Inc., which alleged Apple abused its dominance by kicking \"Fortnite\" out of the App Store for skirting Apple's payment system.</p><p>In February, Epic Games also lodged an antitrust complaint against Apple with the European Commission on similar grounds. Apple has countersued Epic in the U.S. and rejected its claims in the EU.</p><p>Apple will have a chance to argue its case in the music-streaming fight. If found guilty, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of annual revenue and be forced to adjust its business practices, though it can appeal any decision.</p><p>Friday, Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify's head of global affairs, described the EU charges as \"a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.\"</p><p>The number of cases against large tech companies is growing on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and many states have filed antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>And Apple came under fire at a U.S. Senate antitrust hearing last week for its handling of its app store and smartphone ecosystem.</p><p>\"The charges brought in Europe only reaffirm that app store policies and conduct deserve both careful scrutiny and action in our own country,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) said Friday.</p><p>At the core of the EU case is a question increasingly being asked globally: What responsibilities should be placed on companies that serve millions of businesses and billions of consumers with services that in the eyes of many have become essential?</p><p>Under particular scrutiny are companies that operate platforms used by thousands of other businesses. In November, the EU issued charges against Amazon.com Inc. for allegedly unfairly competing against merchants that sell goods via its retail site. Amazon disputed the allegations and said it would ensure that the commission \"has an accurate understanding of the facts.\"</p><p>The EU is also probing Apple over its treatment of payment providers and app developers in its Apple Pay system, as well as its imposition of its in-app payments system for competing providers of electronic books. Apple has said it required all developers to follow strict guidelines and is committed to a \"fair and level playing field for all developers.\"</p>",
