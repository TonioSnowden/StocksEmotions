  "text": "<p>\"Birria comes from a word that literally means mess, and it really has a cult following within Mexico,\" said the Mexican chef Pati Jinich. She includes variations in her forthcoming book, \"Treasures of the Mexican Table\" (Nov. 2, Mariner Books), and the new season of her PBS show, \"Pati's Mexican Kitchen\" (premiering Sept. 18). \"Traditionally, you would use the whole animal,\" Ms. Jinich said. Not ready to commit to nose-to-tail cooking on a Thursday night? No worries: A delicious version can be had using just the goat shoulder or leg (or similar cuts of lamb or beef), a simple sauce of dried chiles and spices, and the accelerated alchemy of a pressure cooker.</p><p>When it's done, shred the meat, drizzle it with some of the broth it cooked in and tuck it into warm corn tortillas along with fresh cilantro and diced onions. If you really want to be authentic, serve cups of broth on the side for dipping and slurping. Then, turn on the tube and pull up a tray table: TV dinner -- inspired by a great TV moment -- has never looked so good.</p><p>---</p><p>Pressure Cooker Birria</p><p>You can ask your butcher to trim the meat into large chunks for you, making an easy dish even easier. A pressure cooker cuts down the cooking time here, but this recipe works well with a slow cooker, too.</p><p>Active Time: 30 minutes</p><p>Total Time: 3 1/2 hours</p><p>Serves: 6-8</p><p>For the birria:</p><p>4 pounds bone-in goat or lamb shoulder, trimmed into large chunks</p><p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>5 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded</p><p>5 dried morita chiles, stemmed and seeded</p><p>2 dried chiles de arbol</p><p>6 garlic cloves, peeled</p><p>3 cups water</p><p>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</p><p>1 tablespoon Mexican oregano</p><p>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p><p>1 teaspoon grated nutmeg</p><p>4 whole cloves, stemmed</p><p>To serve:</p><p>Warm corn tortillas</p><p>White onion, peeled and finely chopped</p><p>Crumbled cotija cheese</p><p>Fresh cilantro, finely chopped</p><p>Limes, cut into wedges</p><p>1. Season meat generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Carefully remove stems and seeds from dried chiles.</p><p>2. Set an electric pressure cooker to saute. Once hot, add dried chiles, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and water. Bring to a boil and simmer until chiles are soft, about 10 minutes. Add vinegar, oregano, cumin seeds, nutmeg, cloves and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Carefully use a blender to blend mixture until smooth. Let cool to room temperature.</p><p>3. Add meat to sauce and toss until fully coated. Transfer pot to refrigerator and let marinate at least 2 hours or up to 48.</p><p>4. Return pot to pressure cooker. Seal lid and set to cook at high pressure for 45 minutes. When finished, let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release. (If you would like to use a slow cooker instead, set machine to low and cook 6-8 hours.)</p><p>5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a large platter. Using two forks, shred meat into bite-size pieces. Discard bones. Cover with foil to keep warm while finishing sauce.</p><p>6. Return pressure cooker to saute setting and bring remaining sauce to a boil. Simmer until reduced by one third, 5-8 minutes. Pour sauce into a small serving bowl, using a sieve to strain off any large pieces of fat or bone left behind. Drizzle a few large spoonfuls of sauce over platter of meat.</p><p>7. To serve, spoon meat into warm corn tortillas. Top with diced onions, cotija and cilantro. Serve with additional sauce and lime wedges on the side.</p><p>-- Adapted from Pati Jinich</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
