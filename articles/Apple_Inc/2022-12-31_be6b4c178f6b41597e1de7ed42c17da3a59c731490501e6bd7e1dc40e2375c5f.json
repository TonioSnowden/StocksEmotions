  "text": "<p>In spite of success stories like Mr. Hough's, some seasoned globe-trotters maintain there is not much you can do to solve your jet lag. Bob Robotti, 69, an investment adviser in New York City, has been traveling regularly for business since 2004 and surpassed a million in-flight miles a decade ago. On one trip to London, Mr. Robotti recalled, he fell asleep three different times in a one-on-one meeting that lasted all of an hour. \"You know it's going to be hard,\" he said of dealing with sleep issues while traveling internationally. \"But it's just a matter of buckling down. I power through.\"</p><p>Powering through is certainly admirable, but is it necessary? These days, there are plenty of tools available to alleviate the suffering. Some are apps, but there are also painstakingly formulated circadian-supplement powder packs and glasses that blast you with blue light to help keep you awake. For a trans-Atlantic flight to Germany, the management of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers even went as far as to offer its players Firefly Portable Recovery Devices, knee straps said to increase full-body blood flow, as part of a comprehensive plan to lessen the effects of jet lag. These kinds of products are under new scrutiny as the appetite for travel begins to return to prepandemic levels. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint numbers show that the number of travelers making their way through airports this December is pretty close to the number who did so the same month in 2019.</p><p>Experts caution that many would-be jet-lag remedies don't deliver entirely on their promises. \"Many products, including some supplements and recovery gadgets, may help reduce the fatigue associated with travel, but they are less likely to address the underlying cause of the jet lag,\" said Jay Olson, who recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>In clinical parlance, \"jet lag\" is the specific, temporary condition that occurs when you travel across several time zones in a brief time span. Our individual circadian rhythm -- the mental, physical and behavioral changes we go through within a 24-hour cycle -- usually aligns with the light-and-dark cycle of our environment. In new locales, we confront a \"mismatch between what time your body thinks it is and the time that it actually is,\" said Mr. Olson. Because our exposure to light plays such a central role in establishing our circadian rhythms, it's key to bridging that gap.</p><p>\"The best thing to do for jet lag is to rapidly synchronize your clock through proper light exposure,\" said Jamie M. Zeitzer, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University and co-director of the school's Center for Sleep and Circadian Sciences.</p><p>\"Travel fatigue,\" by contrast, is a more general term researchers use for the exhaustion that can accompany any travel, even if you never change time zones, said Wendy Troxel, a sleep expert and adjunct faculty in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. Travel fatigue and jet lag are related, even experienced together, but they are distinct.</p><p>Some products don't address the causes of jet lag itself, but might reduce travel fatigue symptoms. For example, it's hard to move around in a plane, which can limit your circulation. A pair of massaging recovery boots from Therabody or Normatec can help get blood flowing again. If flagging circulation is making you feel sluggish, these boots can rouse you. But you might still be jet lagged. \"Until [your] internal clock is synchronized to [that of] the outside world, you will suffer the consequences,\" said Prof. Zeitzer.</p><p>For this reason, a product like a sunrise alarm clock -- which can mimic both a sunset to help tell your brain it is time to sleep and a sunrise to help you wake up -- has some value. But most commercially available models, including the popular Philips SmartSleep Wake-up Light and the new Loftie Lamp, don't produce light bright enough to \"strongly shift your body clock in order to reduce jet lag,\" said Mr. Olson. (A representative from Loftie confirmed its lamp doesn't output light that Mr. Olson would say is bright enough to affect one's circadian rhythm. But Matt Hasset, the company's founder, said its lamp offers \"gentle cues so we make better choices, including when we're getting back to our old time zone after a trip.\" Philips could not be reached for comment.)</p><p>Luckily, our experts say a number of tools and strategies can help your body adapt. Ahead, what you need to do in advance of your flight, while you're on the plane and once you've arrived at your final destination.</p><p>Before takeoff</p><p>When you do nothing at all, your body adjusts slowly, about one time zone each day, to a new location. If you'll be traveling across two or more time zones, said Prof. Troxel, make small adjustments to your sleep schedule in advance. Before traveling east, back up your bedtime and wake-up time by 15 to 30 minutes per night in the two to three days leading up to your departure and seek the brightest light possible in the morning. If you're heading west, delay your bedtime and wake-up by 15-30 minutes. \"Circadian rhythms respond best to these small incremental changes to sleep-wake schedules, which can ease the transition to the new local time zone,\" said Prof. Troxel.</p><p>Making these calculations (and remembering to honor them) isn't easy, but scientists and frequent fliers say apps like Timeshifter, Arcascope and Entrain can help. After you input your flight information and sleep preferences into Timeshifter, it provides a personalized schedule for light exposure and avoidance, sleep, caffeine intake and more. Based on nearly 100,000 surveys, the company claims that when people follow its directives, 96.4% didn't struggle with severe or very severe jet lag.</p><p>Mr. Hough, the asset manager, said you'll get the best results if you really commit to the app's recommendations, even when they seem extreme. \"Wearing dark sunglasses indoors or sleeping at slightly different hours is not always convenient,\" he said. \"But I follow the app slavishly. I am so devoted that my wife jokes that if the app told me to streak at a Yankees game, I would.\"</p><p>In the air</p><p>When flying, it is important to avoid and expose yourself to light at the right times. If you're taking a direct trip to a new locale, aim to experience, as closely as possible, the same levels of light and darkness you would at your destination, said Prof. Zeitzer. Some airlines will assist you by using the cabin lighting to mimic sunrise and sunset at your destination. But if you're flying from say, Japan to California, and then on to Sweden, you must take matters into your own hands. That is especially true if your seatmate is streaming \"Hocus Pocus 2\" on an iPad while you're trying to sleep.</p><p>During the part of your flight when it's dark at your destination, experts recommend you don an eye mask that tightly fits your face, ensuring no light leaks in. If you want to wind down by reading with the overhead light, sport a pair of light-filtering glasses, which limit your exposure.</p><p>Travelers who tend to struggle with sleep should consider taking a small dose of melatonin (from between .5 to 3 mg) several hours before bedtime, said Prof. Troxel. The supplement will help shift your circadian system, said Prof. Zeitzer, if not as effectively as proper light exposure.</p><p>When its daytime at your destination, light-therapy wearables like Ayo -- which sit on your face conspicuously like a pair of glasses (or on top of prescription specs) -- might prove helpful. They use gentle but bright light to replicate the experience of being out in the sun. Two recently completed studies -- one on a group of active-duty U.S. Navy submariners and another, yet unpublished, on a group of Reykjavik University undergraduates -- have shown promise in their ability to regulate circadian rhythms, and perhaps, by extension, jet lag. But even assuming the glasses work perfectly, Prof. Zeitzer sees one caveat. \"It just comes down to: Are you willing to wear this and look kind of weird?\" he said.</p><p>Upon arrival</p><p>When you land, circadian scientists say you should get into the light as quickly as possible to synchronize your clock. The easiest way to do this during the day is just to go outside. \"That will give you more light than you could ever possibly get indoors,\" said Prof. Zeiter.</p><p>If you happen to land on a gray day, getting that light isn't as simple. As an alternative, Mr. Olson suggests traveling with a portable light box. These tablet-shaped lamps, which bathe you in a battery-powered glow, can be held or set up on a nightstand. When purchasing a light box, Mr. Olson said you should make sure it produces light that is 10,000 lux, a measure of brightness.</p><p>When it's nighttime, do what you must to get sleep. All the tools you employed on the plane, be they melatonin or eye masks, could help. Then, get ready to do it all over again.</p><p>---</p><p>Low-Tech Jet Lag Solutions From Everyday Travelers</p><p>Strategies, some rather curious, that road warriors have come to trust</p><p>Go upside down. \"Whether it's a headstand or a handstand, my body and mind are revitalized and ready to go! I stay inverted for a minimum of two minutes. When I'm done being inverted, I feel like I have just run a marathon as I am completely energized from the inside out, I don't even need caffeine.\"</p><p>-- Michelle Thielen, 46, speaker, author and founder of YogaFaith, Seattle</p><p>Change your watch. \"I set my watch to my destination's time as soon as I step through airport security into the terminal. This prepares my brain for the upcoming time shift, so I don't feel as confused or tired once I'm off the flight. This helps me not feel the need to go and sleep as soon as I'm off the flight. Instead, I go find some food.</p><p>-- Jon Callahan, 45, founder and CEO of Boat Biscuit, North Vancouver, British Columbia</p><p>Run with the morning sun. \"It gives you an excuse to get your run in first thing while soaking up natural light.\"</p><p>-- Kyle MacDonald, 40, director of operations of Force by Mojio, San Jose, Calif.</p><p>Stretch au naturel. \"When I arrive at the hotel, I immediately do what rugby players do: Drink lots of water and do a seriously exhaustive nude stretch and yoga session. And yes, that thing from 'Die Hard' where you walk around barefoot in the hotel and scrunch the carpet with your toes kinda works.\"</p><p>-- Baron Christopher Hanson, 52, realtor at Coldwell Banker Realty, Stuart, Fla.</p><p>Get a guided tour when you land. \"My favorite jet lag solution is to take a guided hop-on, hop-off bus tour of my destination. I'm usually tired, so I typically only leave the bus briefly, if at all. It helps me relax and appreciate where I am, and it gives me a better idea of local places that I might want to visit.\"</p><p>-- Barry Maher, 63, author, speaker and consultant, Santa Barbara, Calif.</p><p>Try a cold shower. \"I don't normally take cold showers but if I want to force myself to sleep, it helps. Then, I spray a bit of lavender mist on my pillow, which makes me feel calm. I close my eyes and can usually easily doze off.\"</p><p>-- Jasmine Cheng, 22, travel blogger at TheWanderingGirl.com, Los Angeles</p><p>---</p><p>STEP INTO</p><p>THE LIGHT</p><p>(OR DARKNESS)</p><p>5 products to fight jet lag</p><p>From immune-boosting powders to mushroom coffee, a dizzying array of products claims to combat jet lag.
