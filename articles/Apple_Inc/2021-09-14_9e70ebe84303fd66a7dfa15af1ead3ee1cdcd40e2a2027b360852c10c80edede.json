  "title": "Apple Watch Series 7 and New iPad Mini: Big Changes for Small Screens; Company announces Apple Watch Series 7 with a larger display and an iPad Mini with an all-new design",
  "text": "<p>To keep the mini love going, even the new iPhone 13 Mini got some significant updates: a bigger battery and a new image stabilizer for improved lowlight photos, first announced with last year's gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p><p>It's mostly good news for the small-screen niche. But the bad news is that people who want mini will still have to pay max pricing. Prices didn't come down from previous generations—in fact, the cost of the new iPad Mini is higher.</p><p>Apple Watch Series 7</p><p>You might have to squint to notice the screen difference between the Apple Watch Series 7 and last year's Series 6, but there is one.</p><p>The edges are even more rounded and the borders around the screen are narrower to make way for a larger screen. Apple says this new design means 20% more screen area, 50% more on-screen text and a new full-size keyboard for tapping or swipe-typing messages. You could send a whole email from your watch if you wanted to! Buttons are bigger, too, in apps such as Stopwatch, Activity and Alarm.</p><p>The case size of the watches increased slightly as well. The case size of the smaller model is now 41 millimeters, up from 40 mm, and the larger is 45 mm, up from 44mm. Previous Apple Watch bands will work with the Series 7. Apple hasn't released details, such as weight, for the watch models, but the bulkier hardware could be a turnoff for some small-wristed folks. We'll have to find out when we review the devices ourselves.</p><p>Another refinement: The Series 7 is slightly more durable. Apple says the new watch's thicker display is \"crack-resistant\" and has a new IP6X certification, so it isn't fazed by dust. The watch's water resistance (rated for up to 50 meters in depth) hasn't changed.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new model has the same battery life—18 hours—as previous Apple Watches, so you'll still need to remember to charge it everyday. It can charge faster, however. Eight minutes on the new USB-C charger can power up the watch for eight hours, enough for sleep tracking. In 45 minutes, the Series 7 watch can go from 0% to 80% battery.</p><p>There are no additional health sensors in this model. My colleague reported that Apple is planning a blood-pressure sensor and a wrist-based thermometer for its wearable that will likely be announced in future generations. All in all, this year's update is an incremental refinement rather than a significant upgrade.</p><p>Apple didn't announce a release date for the Series 7, saying it will be available sometime in the fall. The new watch starts at $399 and will replace the Series 6. Apple will continue to sell the $279 Apple Watch SE, which has a smaller screen and similar battery life, but lacks an ECG heart monitor and blood oxygen sensor. And the older Series 3 will stay in circulation for $199.</p><p>New iPad Mini</p><p>In some ways, the day's biggest news was the iPad Mini's redesign. Apple finally gave it the same look and feel as Apple's iPad Pro and Air tablets, and an even more powerful processor. The iPad Mini had featured the same design for years, with only minor performance improvements.</p><p>Now the portable tablet has a flat-edge design, a USB-C port, optional 5G connectivity and support for the Apple Pencil 2 (sold separately), which can magnetically attach to its side. The screen size increased to 8.3 inches, up from 7.9 inches. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor has moved to the power button, as in last year's iPad Air redesign. The new Mini runs the new A15 Bionic chip, making it up to 80% faster than its predecessor, according to Apple.</p><p>The cameras have improved too. There's a 12-megapixel rear camera, up from 8 megapixels, and True Tone flash. More important to our work-via-Zoom reality, the front-facing camera has been updated to a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with Center Stage, which automatically zooms and pans to keep you in frame.</p><p>But the starting price, at $499, is $100 more than the last Mini's base price. And it only includes 64GB of internal storage; people who want to step up will have to pay $649 for 256GB of storage.</p><p>Share Your Thoughts</p><p>What new features would you like in your Apple wear? Join the conversation below.</p><p>If you do want to keep on the cheap, the basic 10.2-inch iPad got a respectable but less dramatic update Tuesday. It now has the A13 Bionic processor and a new 12-megapixel ultrawide front camera with Center Stage. And its starting price remained at $329 for a 64GB model.</p><p>If you're wondering, will 64 gigabytes be enough? I'm with you. You can now preorder the new iPads, set to arrive Sept. 24, but if you want more details first, look out for my review of the new devices.</p><p>For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.</p><p>Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Watch Series 7 and New iPad Mini: Big Changes for Small Screens</p>",
