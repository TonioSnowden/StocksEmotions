  "title": "Future of Everything: CEO Says OnlyFans Not Being an App Hasn't Hurt It",
  "text": "<p>Distributing OnlyFans through Apple Inc.'s App Store and Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play store would require paying those companies the 30% cut they take from digital subscriptions. That would mean creators wouldn't be able to keep as much of the money they earn, Mr. Stokely said.</p><p>\"It's really important to us to be able to pay creators the highest commission possible,\" said Mr. Stokely, whose company is based in London.</p><p>Mr. Stokely founded Fenix International Ltd.'s OnlyFans in 2016 as a paid social-media site for adults with more liberal content policies than the traditional social platforms like Facebook and Instagram. To recruit creators, he said he emailed influencers, making pitches that if they had two million followers, and 1% of those followers paid $10 a month for exclusive content, then they could earn $200,000 a month on OnlyFans.</p><p>There are now more than 300 creators on OnlyFans who have earned more than $1 million, Mr. Stokely said. He said the site had paid out more than $3 billion to creators.</p><p>Apple bans apps that serve adult content from its App Store, but OnlyFans developed a free streaming app where creators can post their content if they comply with the rules for Apple's and Google's app stores and other platforms.</p><p>OnlyFans is better known for its porn stars than its fitness buffs, but the site's growth is due in part to the company's efforts to diversify its creators. The site now has more than 120 million registered users, Mr. Stokely said.</p><p>The pandemic supercharged the growth of social-media and entertainment platforms as people stuck at home turned to their screens to fill their days. Mr. Stokely said OnlyFans was adding users before the pandemic. He said he didn't think being a website during the era of apps had held his company back because OnlyFans has the look and feel of traditional social-media platforms.</p>",
