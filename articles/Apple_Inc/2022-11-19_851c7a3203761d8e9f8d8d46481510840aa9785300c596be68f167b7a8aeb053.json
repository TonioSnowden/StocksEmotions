  "title": "Nurdle Hunters Patrol for Plastic Pellets That Can Kill Wildlife; Federal regulators don't track the spillage of nurdles, used to manufacture everything from water bottles to iPhone cases. So citizens have taken up the cause.",
  "text": "<p>BEAVER, Pa.â€”Standing on the muddy edge of the Ohio River, James Cato held up a single nurdle, a plastic pellet the size of a lentil.</p><p>Mr. Cato set a timer for 10 minutes, and within seconds about a dozen people, including a teacher, a social worker and a college professor, began finding the pellets as they combed the shoreline.</p><p>\"Once you know what they look like, you see them everywhere,\" said Mr. Cato, a community organizer with Mountain Watershed Association, who was training residents to look for the pellets, known as \"nurdles.\" The group wanted to determine how many pellets were already in the river days before a nearby Shell PLC petrochemical plant began producing large quantities of them.</p><p>Billions of pounds of nurdles are manufactured each year in the U.S. They are the basic component in a vast range of plastic products, melted down to make everything from water bottles to iPhone cases to artificial Christmas trees. The pellets also often escape into the environment from railcars, ships and plastics manufacturers, and can kill fish and birds if ingested.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency doesn't track nurdles in the environment, a spokesman said. And while it is generally illegal to release the pellets into waterways under federal and state water permits, nurdles aren't considered a hazardous material, which has made their cleanup less urgent than other types of pollution, say some regulators.</p><p>Citizen groups around the country have moved in to fill the regulatory gap. They survey them on beaches and riverbanks, document spills, lobby for legislation and file lawsuits against manufacturers and companies that transport the pellets.</p><p>Volunteers with about 220 groups, from Charleston Waterkeeper in South Carolina to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, survey nurdles at least once a month through a partnership with Nurdle Patrol, a citizen-science project based out of the University of Texas. Groups in Texas and South Carolina have won court settlements requiring companies to clean up nurdles from beaches, creeks and bays.</p><p>Mark Benfield, an oceanographer at Louisiana State University who studies microplastics, said he expects nurdles to be more tightly regulated in the future and that data being gathered by citizen groups will help determine whether regulations are effective.</p><p>\"I do think it's very valuable, both for getting the message out to the general public and providing a baseline for evaluating whether environmental controls work,\" he said. Nurdles were first reported in U.S. coastal waters in the early 1970s, according to an EPA report in 1992. At the time, 60 billion pounds of plastic resin, mostly in the form of nurdles, were manufactured annually in the U.S., according to the agency. </p><p>A vial containing nurdles found along waterways in Western Pennsylvania.

The trade group said thousands of facilities that produce or transport nurdles participate in a program launched 25 years ago to minimize pellet loss.</p><p>Petrochemical plants turn ethane produced by natural gas drilling into nurdles and then pump them into railcars. Other facilities unload the pellets, bag them and put them into shipping containers. The industry safety program includes installing screens in storm drains and placing catch trays under valves to contain the pellets.</p><p>Joshua Baca, vice president of plastics at the chemistry council, said the trade group has also supported legislation that would require the EPA to set a federal standard to prevent pellet loss.</p><p>Like other plastics, nurdles can be mistaken for food by marine wildlife. Mr. Benfield, the oceanographer, said it has been well-documented that nurdles absorb more toxins the longer they are in the environment and that they can build up in the digestive systems of seabirds and other animals.</p><p>Groups that are tracking nurdles have found them from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, up the Atlantic coast and in cities from San Francisco to Philadelphia. The crowdsourced Nurdle Patrol program has gathered more than 15,000 surveys from 6,800 volunteers since 2018 to document how widespread they are.</p><p>Jace Tunnell, reserve director of the University of Texas Marine Science Institute who started Nurdle Patrol, said it isn't uncommon to find 100 to 200 nurdles in that time on many beaches in Texas. There are roughly 20,000 nurdles per pound, and it takes about 600 to make a toothbrush, he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What steps should federal and state regulators be taking to prevent plastic parts from infiltrating the environment? Join the conversation below.</p><p>After a ship on the Mississippi River broke loose in heavy winds in 2020, hundreds of millions of nurdles spilled from a shipping container. The U.S. Coast Guard said it didn't have jurisdiction over the spill because nurdles aren't considered hazardous materials.</p><p>A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said the shipping company cleaned up as many nurdles as possible. The agency hasn't issued any fines.</p><p>In 2019, Formosa Plastics Corp. agreed to pay $50 million as part of a settlement, after Texas residents alleged in a lawsuit that the company's petrochemical plant in Port Comfort, Texas, had released plastic powder and nurdles into Lavaca Bay and other waterways.</p><p>Fred Neske, a Formosa spokesman, said the company is taking a number of steps to prevent nurdles from escaping. Diane Wilson, a retired shrimper and environmental activist who led the plaintiffs group, said a cleanup of a creek near the plant that began last month is expected to take two years.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, a Norfolk Southern train derailment north of Pittsburgh released 120,000 pounds of nurdles in May, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. The agency said 99% of the nurdles were recovered.</p><p>On the Ohio River, the Shell petrochemical plant built to take advantage of the region's supply of natural gas from shale drilling began operations on Tuesday. The company has said the plant will produce roughly 3.5 billion pounds of plastic pellets a year.</p><p>Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, said the company has put multiple barriers in place to monitor and retain everything from powder to pellets in pipes, silos and transport vessels.</p><p>But a few days before the plant began operating, people finding nurdles in the river said they worry more could eventually escape from the plant.</p><p>Dianne Peterson, who lives in O'Hara Township, Pa., where she owns a toy and eco-goods store, said she found 12 nurdles in 10 minutes. \"It's already a huge global problem,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at Kris.Maher@wsj.com</p><p>Nurdle Hunters Patrol for Plastic Pellets That Can Kill Wildlife</p>",
