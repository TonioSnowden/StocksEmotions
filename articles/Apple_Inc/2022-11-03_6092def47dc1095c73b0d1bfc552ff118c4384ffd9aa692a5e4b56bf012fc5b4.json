  "title": "Meta Executive Nick Clegg's Message to New Twitter Owner Elon Musk: 'Welcome to the Club'; Facebook parent's business struggles are overblown, executive argues",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said he was pleased to see that Mr. Musk said he plans to create a moderation council with diverse viewpoints to help Twitter make content decisions.</p><p>\"I think it is a good start in making sure that not all the power lies with these West Coast tech companies,\" Mr. Clegg said, adding that Facebook launched something similar several years ago with its Oversight Board. \"If he does the same thing, I think that would be a very good thing, actually.\"</p><p>Mr. Clegg was speaking at the Fortune CEO Initiative. During the conversation, he also took shots at rivals TikTok and Apple Inc., and defended his company's pivot to the metaverse.</p><p>Mr. Clegg said reports describing Meta's business as failing are \"lazy headline caricature,\" and he emphasized that the company has more daily users than ever and is yet to monetize most of its features.</p><p>\"The core business of the existing apps is actually incredibly healthy,\" Mr. Clegg said.</p><p>Meta shares are down more than 70% this year, in part because of investor concerns about the company continuing to spend tens of billions of dollars on the metaverse, a strategic pivot that won't pay dividends for years at best.</p><p>\"It does take time, it does take patience, it does take investment,\" Mr. Clegg said. \"And at the same time, I think we're going to be pretty robust in explaining that our core business is doing very well indeed.\"</p><p>On Apple, which last year instituted changes to its ad-tracking policies that badly hurt Meta's business, Mr. Clegg said he believes regulators are rightfully paying more attention to whether those moves are anticompetitive.</p><p>\"I don't think Apple will get away with this scot-free,\" Mr. Clegg said, adding that the Silicon Valley rival often couches its moves as being in service of privacy. Just as often, he added, the result is \"Apple doing a fair amount of damage to some of their competitors when it comes to online advertising and then building up their own advertising.\"</p><p>Mr. Clegg said that every company that does well and grows fast should be subject to regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>\"I think it is fair to suggest that particular companies create these very closed, these very closed walled gardens, if you like, at such vast scale, such lucrative scale, and that should be scrutinized,\" Mr. Clegg said. \"I think it is, and I think it will be.\"</p><p>In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said: \"A user's data belongs to them and they should get to decide whether to share their data and with whom.\" The spokesperson added that the company has \"received strong support from regulators and privacy advocates for this new feature.\"</p><p>Asked about upstart social-media rival TikTok Inc., Mr. Clegg said Chinese tech companies are able to operate in the U.S. while still being able to tap into China's vast consumer market, whereas U.S. companies such as Meta can't do both.</p><p>\"There is a real problem that there just isn't a level playing field between some of the big sort of mega Chinese companies and the big American tech companies,\" he said. \"TikTok is a good example. It has this vast domestic market in China. It competes directly with companies such as us in the United States, yet we're not able to compete with its home market.\"</p><p>Mr. Clegg also addressed concerns that Washington lawmakers and regulators have expressed regarding where TikTok stores its American user data, saying that the location of the data shouldn't be the biggest issue.</p><p>\"TikTok is basically just a pure algorithmic flywheel. You watch a video and the algorithm proposes the next one for you to watch, and so on. That algorithm is of course designed in China,\" he said. \"The issue is a fundamental design about what you see and in which order. That's the really key question.\"</p><p>TikTok executives have said they are working with the U.S. government on an agreement that would satisfy all national-security concerns.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com</p><p>Meta Executive Nick Clegg's Message to New Twitter Owner Elon Musk: 'Welcome to the Club'</p>",
