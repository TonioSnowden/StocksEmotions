He also would not be drawn on whether the Fed would consider raising rates from their current near-zero level by half a percentage point at some point this year, as opposed to the quarter point increases that have become the norm. It is more than two decades since the central bank last raised rates by more than 0.25 per cent.</p> <p>He highlighted the current strength of the economy in comments to journalists after the FOMC meeting, compared with previous rate tightening cycles. </p> <p>“If you look back to . . . 2015, 16, 17, 18, when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 per cent, even below,” he said.</p> <p>Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein, characterised Powell's comments as “very hawkish”.</p> <p>Investors agreed. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent, reversing earlier gains of as much as 3.4 per cent, the biggest downward turn for the index since September 2020.</p> <p>The Nasdaq Composite index also ended the day unchanged, having been up more than 3 per cent before the Powell press conference. Equity markets in Europe and Asia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/324fdeeb-cbd9-4c5c-87fc-1c9ba06899e7\">were lower today</a> and US futures trading suggested further losses for equity markets when Wall Street opens later.</p> <p>In the debt markets, the biggest moves were in the rate sensitive two-year Treasury bond market. The yield on the two-year Treasury note climbed to 1.16 per cent — its highest level since February 2020. The yield on the 10-year note rose 0.09 percentage points to 1.87 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>By abandoning a systemic framework for monetary policy, the central bank has spawned an all-asset speculative bubble, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ece92145-443d-4e94-bfa9-7fe06cb9c00a\">writes John Hussman</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Has the Fed made a policy error?

Bill Ackman buys Netflix stake worth $1.1bn</strong> Pershing Square, Bill Ackman's investment group, has bought 3.1m shares of Netflix in recent days as the hedge fund billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba5ab83c-3a84-4544-8b7f-3158b358ef69\">seeks to capitalise</a> on a sharp sell-off that has almost halved the streaming company's market value in the past few months.</p> <p><strong>3.
