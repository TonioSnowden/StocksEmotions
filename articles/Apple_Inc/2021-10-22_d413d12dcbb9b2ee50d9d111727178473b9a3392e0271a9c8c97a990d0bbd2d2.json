  "title": "Shares of  Snap Sink  On Apple  Warning  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Snap Inc. said Thursday it expects growth to slow in the current quarter due to recent changes to Apple Inc.'s App Store privacy rules, sending its stock tumbling by 22% in after-hours trading and highlighting the impact of the iPhone maker's new policy on digital advertising. </p><p>   The social-media company said revenue rose 57% for the period ended Sept. 30, slightly below analysts' expectations and its own guidance, but it expects expansion to slow. Daily users rose 23% to 306 million. </p><p>   Apple's new rules have made it difficult for advertisers to test and measure their campaigns, according to Snap. Its share price fell to around $58.62 after closing at $75.11. Other tech companies, including Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc., also fell in after-hours trading. </p><p>   \"This shows the Achilles' heel in Snap's model,\" said Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali. \"That is effectively a lack of massive first-party data, which is what you need to be successful in this business.\" </p><p>   Snap, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said Thursday that it projects revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31 to range between $1.17 billion and $1.21 billion, which would be up from $911 million a year ago but below the $1.36 billion that analysts polled by FactSet expected. </p><p>   \"While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our ad partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS,\" Snap said. </p><p>   Apple's new policy has roiled the digital-advertising business since it was announced last year. The policy, implemented in April, requires apps to ask users if they want to be tracked, which has made it harder for advertisers to target their ads at the right audience and get information on how well their ads performed. </p><p>   U.S. users opt into tracking only about 16% of the times they encounter the Apple privacy prompt, according to mobile app analytics provider Flurry. </p><p>   The move has prompted complaints from companies that use such tracking technology to sell ads and led to a running, public fight between the iPhone maker and Facebook. Facebook said last month that the changes were impeding tools that the social-media company uses to help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. </p><p>   \"Investors have been underestimating what the impact of Apple's rule change would be for digital advertisers,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Ygal Arounian. \"That's something that's likely to get worse before it gets better.\" </p><p>   To cope with the problem, Snap said it is developing additional first-party tools to help its ad partners achieve their goals. </p><p></p>",
