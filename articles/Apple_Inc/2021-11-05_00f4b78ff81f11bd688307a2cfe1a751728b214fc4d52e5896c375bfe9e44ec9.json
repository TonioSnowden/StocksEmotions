  "text": "<p>Face masks for customers — whether they're vaccinated or not — will no longer be required at more than 100 of the 270 Apple Stores in the U.S. starting Friday, with more stores being added in the coming days.</p><p>Apple employees will still be required to wear masks, and customers must still wear masks in areas with local mask mandates, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p><p>Last month, a security guard at an Apple Store in Manhattan was stabbed in a dispute over mask-wearing.</p><p>Apple Stores dropped their mask rules in June, but reinstated them in July as the delta variant led to a surge in coronavirus infections.</p><p>Most Apple office workers are still working remotely; in August, the company delayed the reopening of its offices until January, after which workers are expected to be in the office at least three days a week.</p>",
