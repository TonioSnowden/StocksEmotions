  "text": "<p>I wasn't expecting to relish bread slathered in pork fat and topped with onions and paprika, but the <em>Grammelschmalzbrot</em> at Heuriger Hamböck was surprisingly good. The onions gave it crunch, the lard gave it body and the paprika gave it spice but, as often with these things, it was the location that lent the extra magic.</p> <p>It was the benches of the winemaker's tavern, gathered under the vines on a late summer's evening. It was the view across the rooftops towards the Danube's south bank, where the abbey of Göttweig straddled the hilltop like a baroque fortress. And it was the glass of Grüner Veltliner by my right hand, so fruity and refreshing, and costing only €1.60.</p> <p><em>Heurigen</em> are cheerful, informal taverns that pop up in the courtyards, terraces and gardens of Austria's winemakers in summer and early autumn. The name is short for “heuriger Wein” (“this year's wine”) though, for much of the summer, the young wines they serve will necessarily be from the previous year's harvest, albeit fresh from the barrel. But from the middle of September, they also offer <em>Sturm</em>, the first fermentation of the new season: cloudy, fizzy, fruity, fresh and of unpredictable strength.</p> <p>Heurigen serve only their own wine, as well as simple food, and at bargain prices. That is the case even here in the Wachau, despite it being traditionally seen as the country's most prestigious wine region. About an hour's drive west of Vienna, it stretches for 22 miles alongside the Danube, a bucolic valley strung like a harp with the vines of some 250 family-run winemakers, and quilted with apricot and apple orchards. Its bluffs are sprinkled with castles and abbeys, its slopes adorned with small villages, each marked by a church spire and a cluster of pastel-coloured houses.</p> <p>Down on the river bank, processions of cyclists pick their way along the <a href=\"https://www.danube-cycle-path.com/\">Danube cycle path</a>, one of the most popular routes in Europe. Some stop at the abbey of Melk, at the western entrance to the Wachau. This giant seven-courtyard, 497-room property was built to accommodate visits of the Habsburg emperor and his retinue, with frescoed ceilings and a library of more than 100,000 books.</p> <p>Others stop at Dürnstein, the prettiest of the riverside villages, its monastery bell tower a delicate porcelain blue. Looming over Dürnstein are the ruins of a castle where England's King Richard I, aka the Lionheart, was briefly incarcerated in 1192, on his way back from the crusades, after offending Leopold V, Duke of Austria. </p> <p>For my explorations I'd come to Krems, the hub town at the Wachau's eastern end. This is where I discovered the Heuriger Hamböck, just upriver. Wherever I ventured in the Wachau thereafter, by boat, bus or bike, I made sure to stop off at a heuriger. First, though, you need to know what to look for: that cluster of fir or conifer branches above a doorway, sometimes, but not always, accompanied by a hand-painted sign.</p> <p>I particularly liked Heuriger Glück, by the hamlet of Mitterarnsdorf on the river's south bank opposite Spitz, reached by an engineless foot ferry that uses a combination of overhead cable and the river current to slide across. Here farmer Glück's courtyard was filled with merry cyclists, but fortunately there were more seats in the garden beyond.</p> <p>I also liked Heuriger Enzlmüller, in the quiet streets of the village of Stein, a convivial gathering of mostly locals at tables on the street corner and inside a wood-panelled front room, covered in family photos.</p> <p>In all these places I always asked for Sturm. That first taste of the summer wine (called <em>Federweisser</em> in Germany) is an inevitable stage in any winemaking process, but many countries don't permit it to be served to the public because of its uncertain alcoholic content. Happily, heurigen can do their own thing and now, as the Wachau colours up in scarlets and golds, is the time to see them in action.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Andrew Eames 2022 'Postcard from Austria: first of the summer wine' FT.com 24 September.
