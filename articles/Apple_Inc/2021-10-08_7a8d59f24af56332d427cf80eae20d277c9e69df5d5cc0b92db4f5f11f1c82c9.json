But the short-term reality is that China and many others have little choice but to increase coal consumption to meet power demand.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>Read more</h1> <p><strong>Robert Armstrong</strong> The absolutely bonkers rise in UK natural gas prices and liquid natural gas in Asia overshadow the merely staggering doubling of Chinese coal and US natural gas prices.

Senate votes to raise US debt limit until December </strong>Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df1908d6-5b26-43c1-8e6e-3e95133e78e9\">reached an agreement</a> to extend the debt ceiling to December 3, providing short-term relief to investors and executives who had fretted about a possible government default this month.</p> <p><strong>2. Ireland signs up to global corporate tax deal</strong> Ireland is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a2f69aa-f61a-4f4e-934f-293665019229\">abandon its cherished low corporate tax rate</a> and replace it with a higher, internationally agreed charge. In the past Ireland has lured international companies, including tech giants Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook, to its shores with promises of lower corporation taxes. The change is expected to cost the country €2bn a year in lost revenues. </p> <p><strong>3. Musk says Tesla will move HQ to Texas</strong> Tesla is moving its headquarters from California to Texas, chief executive Elon Musk said in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272b678a-ff4d-4ecf-90a0-4eee9d32f844\">off-the-cuff comments</a> after the electric car company's annual shareholder meeting in Austin. The billionaire caused controversy last year when during the depths of coronavirus he called California's shelter-in-place orders “fascist”.</p> <p><strong>4. US special forces secretly train Taiwan's military</strong> The Pentagon has been sending special operations forces to Taiwan for several years to help the country prepare for a possible Chinese attack, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46794116-7355-4669-b947-ce32bc5aff1a\">according to people familiar with the deployments</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Journalists win Nobel Peace Prize</strong> Philippines journalist Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov&#xa0;from Russia have been awarded this year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f422b4d3-0a4f-4e3b-988e-b4a4bad74262#post-0b48820a-6096-40dd-9bf9-71dde1821cfe\">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. The Nobel Committee said the award was given to the two for their “courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and in Russia”.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>A record number of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b05db94d-c70f-491e-859f-a72ccaea7467#post-20b3b055-8942-4f39-a6f0-0e3c27d881db\">small <strong>US</strong> businesses</a> say they cannot find enough qualified workers, adding to signs that labour shortages are holding back the recovery.</p></li>  <li><p>After more than 18 months of relentless virus elimination regimes, governments across <strong>Asia-Pacific</strong> are to&#xa0;beginning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd857fcc-0032-45ab-be36-02e6e67e277c\">to ease restrictions</a>&#xa0;on domestic movement and social distancing as well as border controls.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>UK</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b05db94d-c70f-491e-859f-a72ccaea7467#post-69a7f341-1b81-4216-9bd9-056ea62a1d2e\">slashed its travel “red list”</a> from 54 to seven destinations from which returning travellers must go into hotel quarantine. </p></li>  <li><p>When future historians look back, how will the knock-on, indirect and half-hidden <strong>costs of Covid-19</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/258e9307-b58d-4c55-bdd3-2da47193456c\">compare</a> with the direct effects of the disease?</p></li> </ul> <h1>The days ahead</h1> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>The pace of US jobs growth rebounded sharply in September, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57ed92ab-994b-4fed-b422-518a0562c698\">new data today</a> is expected to show. The alarming spread of the Delta coronavirus variant deterred hiring in August.</p> <p><strong>US-Mexico security meeting</strong> A group of top US officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/571b17e2-31b0-465c-b669-cef32de04b8c\">will travel to Mexico City today</a> to try to revitalise the two countries' bilateral security relationship. </p> <p><strong>IMF meeting</strong> The 24 board members of the IMF <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bda40695-35f7-48ec-bc78-35a8aef982ec\">meet today</a> to decide whether the fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, should retain their backing. Georgieva has been accused of unethical behaviour in her previous job at the World Bank.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Post-pandemic recovery may prove more complicated than it looks</strong> A bad news pile-up makes it hard to understand precisely where we are, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb8ea1ed-ddb1-4265-a1e7-ef01bb8faf52\">writes John Plender</a>. Volatility and insecurity have cast a dismal spell over global markets since the S&amp;P 500 index peaked on September 2, he adds.</p> <p><strong>The US right's love affair with Hungary's leader </strong>US conservatives used to admire Viktor Orban from a distance. Now they want to emulate him close up, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eb06f95-944f-4593-aa44-594467d3329e\">writes Edward Luce</a>. The reasons for Orban's ascent in the eyes of Republicans offer a road map on how the party plans to return to power.</p> <p><strong>Return of the renters </strong>Tenants in world cities such as London and New York are finding the deluge of discounted properties that hit the market during the first coronavirus lockdowns is fast drying up — and the <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8c147c09-5eeb-4f9a-a4ab-e219895d6426\">scramble</a> for rental homes is back.</p> <p><strong>The hidden costs of cost-benefit analysis </strong>Every economist has their own list of pros and cons, although the hope is to be a little more systematic. Tim Harford <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8cd6413b-b67f-4883-87a2-b514457763b9\">asks</a>, what is the point if all the costs and benefits being analysed are flights of fantasy?</p> <p><strong>Catching billionaire lottery fever </strong>National lotteries have been around for so long that someone scooping a lot of money against high odds is no longer a novelty. Whether it makes any greater financial sense to buy a ticket is dubious. But record-breaking payouts have been engineered by reducing the chances to near zero. <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/6917370d-088c-4d58-ad58-6f03124a9905\">This has not put people off</a>.</p> <h1>Music</h1> <p>Can the music industry clean up its act? For decades, a culture of sexual abuse has been ignored. Helen Brown asks whether the conviction of R Kelly, who was found guilty of using his superstar status to sexually abuse women and children, is a <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/22d0909f-83e7-43db-884c-54a93c044f12\">turning point</a>.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Leart Vuciterna 2021 'FirstFT: China orders more coal production' FT.com 8 October.
