  "title": "PayPal expands BNPL offerings with monthly-payment option; Pay Monthly feature will let users split purchases into chunks that they pay back over the course of six to 24 months",
  "text": "<p>Those approved for the Pay Monthly installment program will be able to choose from up to three options of various lengths, according to a release. The plans will carry \"risk-based APR ranging from 0%-29.99%\" and span six to 24 months.</p><p>A PayPal spokesperson noted that while there won't be 0% APR offers by default through Pay Monthly, merchants will be able to introduce 0% APR promotions upon the full launch of the feature this summer.</p><p>Read: PayPal will let users send crypto to friends, transfer assets to other wallets</p><p>\"How consumers look to pay for larger purchases is evolving and there is a growing demand for flexible payment options,\" Greg Lisiewski, PayPal's vice president of global pay-later products said in the press release, while noting that 22 million PayPal PYPL users have opted for a pay-later offering in the past year. Pay Monthly aims to \"ensure checkout matches their needs and budgeting preferences.\"</p><p>PayPal introduced a Pay In 4 installment offering in 2020, letting consumers make interest-free payments in chunks over the span of six weeks. Additionally, the company has long offered a more traditional lending product that gives people a line of credit, asks for minimum monthly payments, and doesn't charge interest if a consumer pays back the cost in full within six months. PayPal will continue to offer both services in addition to Pay Monthly.</p><p>The introduction of Pay Monthly comes as the world of installment payments continues to evolve. Apple Inc. AAPL said earlier this month that it would debut an interest-free pay-later feature, for which the company will handle its own lending decisions. Meanwhile, shares of BNPL pure-play Affirm Holdings Inc. AFRM have tumbled more than 80% so far this year, in part due to concerns about how the market for BNPL services will hold up in more stressful economic conditions.</p><p>See more: Apple's buy-now pay-later launch is 'an obvious' but probably 'modest' risk to incumbents, says analyst</p><p>PayPal has seen its own shares come under pressure as well, resulting in a roughly 60% year-to-date decline. While once-hot financial-technology stocks more generally have struggled in recent months, PayPal also is dealing with some self-inflicted wounds after resetting aggressive growth expectationsand admitting that it needs to \"do better\" to satisfy investors.</p><p>PayPal expands BNPL offerings with monthly-payment option</p>",
