Hitchcock will come to mind. That he does is a testament to the strong whiff of menace that can arise in this eight-episode Israeli series -- even from a fresh-faced young woman's clear delight at recognizing her longtime idol, movie director Alice Ginor. </p><p>\n  She's played by a steadfastly enthralling Ayelet Zurer: The show is all hers. The young woman, who introduces herself as Sophie Marciano (Lihi Kornowski), elaborates on all that Alice's films have meant to her. All of which Alice is pleased enough to hear, though she also looks quite recognizably like someone who would be happy to end the conversation and return to reading her cellphone. The authenticity of this opening scene holds a bright promise. Gradually, Sophie, still nattering on about her devotion, becomes a touch less endearing. \"I wondered where you disappeared to,\" she tells Alice, who requires no reminders that her film directing efforts are now sparse. She teaches, edits scripts and commercials, Alice explains, and she has a family. </p><p>\n  And she is now about to become busy, she learns, dealing with Sophie, who has just dropped the news that she herself has written a film script and would love nothing more than for Alice's husband, David (Gal Toren), a prominent actor, to star in it. Alice learns this on the train while holding an unlockable bathroom door closed for Sophie, who has dragooned her idol into the performance of this duty without hesitation -- a reminder of her youth: She's 24 years old. It's the end of any suspicion this relationship might echo the one in \"All About Eve.\" Though this is just the beginning of Sophie's entry into Alice's life and career. </p><p>\n  There is good reason, as the story unfolds, for an inclination to find the familiar, some pattern to relate to. For as it turns out, there is, in \"Losing Alice\" -- which bills itself as a psychological thriller -- a steady infusion of illusory events and other elements intended to deepen the mystery of this tale, many of which instead simply flatten the story into little points of confusion as flashy ventures of this kind tend to do. </p><p>\n  Between those little points, fortunately, a rich drama emerges of ambition and the passion for achievement, not only in Alice but the world of filmmakers in which she travels. (The series is the creation of Sigal Avin.) The tone is undergirded by humor at its best, and not surprisingly, in the most erotic scenes. The ones that require Alice -- who has been made director of Sophie's film -- to direct her husband making intimate love to a beautiful young woman. One of these leads to a moment of undeniable revelation when Alice, a cool, sophisticated professional, snaps out \"Cut!\" Why cut, her ever patient and honest husband wants to know -- what's wrong with the scene? Do it over, he's told. The actors embrace again and again, the director snaps \"Cut!\" By this time David is livid, and shouting; the director can't tell him what's wrong with the take. Everyone else will have guessed -- it's unbearable to her. </p><p>\n  In its dry, frequently raucous way, the series undertakes a vivid look at a small company of filmmakers, but it is, at heart, pure melodrama whose subjects include a mysterious disappearance, murder, much loved neighbors having trouble conceiving a child, and family relationships generally. Among them the one David has with his ever-present and loving mother (Chelli Goldenberg), who comes jauntily into the bathroom to his obvious dismay, where he's bathing in the tub. She has fresh warm towels for him, she announces. Why doesn't she go to bed now, David asks her. But his mother is worried about family problems -- \"such an unhealthy situation.\" </p><p>\n  The film's satirical eye is keen. Influenced by Sophie, Alice attempts, briefly, to throw herself into all the latest in cultural rages. She tries new dance and exercise-class techniques that promise improvement to mind and spirit -- all solemn absurdities to which she listens patiently and all of which she's too smart to tolerate. </p><p>\n  An immensely compelling drama, if an overlong one, and a heroine who is, title notwithstanding, anything but lost. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Money may be scarce and the future questionable for some new inhabitants of Reunion Island -- an overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean -- but in the dark of our winter, with turbulence in the air and the American military needed to guard the nation's government buildings, a visit to Reunion feels like a tonic in six episodes. </p><p>\n  In \"Reunions\" (Monday, AcornTV) the TV series, the new arrivals consist of two half brothers, one Black and one white, who are meeting for the first time, along with their families. They are here because the brothers, Jeremy (Loup-Denis Elion) and Antoine (Nicolas Bridet), have each inherited half of a hotel on the island from their recently deceased father -- a place in dire financial straits. The brothers and their families decide to join forces to try to save the place. How they will succeed in doing this is a question since most of the arriving family members have no money, and at least one is being pursued by a bill collector. </p><p>\n  Still, the atmosphere is festive, the conversation lively, including those between feuding relatives. There is, above all, the look of those trees, those skies and everything else in this faraway place. </p><p></p>",
