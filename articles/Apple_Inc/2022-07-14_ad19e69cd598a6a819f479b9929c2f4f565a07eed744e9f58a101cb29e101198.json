  "title": "TSMC Raises Revenue Guidance Despite Chip-Boom Slowdown; Strong demand for chips used in products including high-performance computers likely to keep plants fully occupied, executives say",
  "text": "<p>\"Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continues to exceed our ability to supply,\" said C.C. Wei, TSMC's chief executive, referring to the recent order cuts flagged by some chip makers. TSMC's production capacity will remain tight throughout this year, Mr. Wei said in a quarterly earnings call.</p><p>TSMC's confidence highlights the strengths of its business, even as elsewhere in the semiconductor industry signs of weakness emerge following a chip boom during the pandemic.</p><p>Chip maker Micron Technology Inc. has recently issued a subdued revenue outlook for the current quarter, spooking some investors. The average contract price for a major type of memory chips has dropped for the first time in two years during the April-to-June quarter versus the prior year.</p><p>Signs of the industry's slowdown follow a period of soaring demand for semiconductors during the pandemic, which created extra demand for personal computers, gadgets and data servers that help power online activity. Recently, PC sales have slumped and cryptocurrency markets have crashed.</p><p>But TSMC is still facing robust demand and sticking with its plan to invest about $40 billion this year to beef up chip production, said Chairman Mark Liu.</p><p>For the April-to-June quarter, its net profit surged by 76% to a record 237 billion New Taiwan dollars, equivalent to $7.95 billion.</p><p>Quarterly revenue from the high-performance computing sector, which processes data and calculations at high speeds, increased 13% from the previous quarter and was greater than the revenue from smartphones, which rose 3%. The two sectors accounted for more than half of TSMC's second quarter revenue.</p><p>Hsinchu-based TSMC counts iPhone maker Apple Inc. and graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp. among its customers. In the high-performance computing sector, TSMC-made chips are used in central-processing and graphics units, as well as in autonomous driving vehicles. Company executives said this sector is going to be its main driver of growth in the next couple of years.</p><p>PHOTOS: There Aren't Enough Chips - Why Are They So Hard to Make? </p><p>https://www.wsj.com/story/there-arent-enough-chips-why-are-they-so-hard-to-make-3e29c7e0</p><p>PHOTOS: There Aren't Enough Chips - Why Are They So Hard to Make?. PHOTO: Caitlin Ochs for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>TSMC faces competition from its rival Samsung Electronics Co. in making the world's most advanced chips. Samsung announced initial production of its most advanced 3-nanometer chips last month, which came ahead of TSMC's slated mass production of a similar-level technology product later this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, TSMC plans to continue investing in less-advanced chips, such as the ones used in cars, Mr. Wei said. The less-advanced chips were traditionally products that TSMC didn't emphasize as much as its cutting-edge chips, but their importance for the industry is growing as demand for such chips expands.</p><p>TSMC's biggest markets, including the U.S. and China, have been facing economic troubles. U.S. inflation reached a four-decades-high of 9.1% in June, elevating the risk of a recession, while China is expected to record its weakest spell of growth in more than two years when it releases April-June gross domestic product data on Friday.</p><p>North American customers accounted for about 64% of TSMC's second-quarter revenue, while revenue from China represented 13% of the total, up from 11% in the previous quarter.</p><p>Asked about the Arizona plant that TSMC is currently building, Mr. Liu said the company was aware of the higher-than-expected costs, such as labor. It is still working on reducing costs and obtaining government subsidies, he said, without elaborating on those points. TSMC has no plan to form joint ventures with U.S. partners, he said.</p><p>Kosaku Narioka contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</p><p>TSMC Raises Revenue Guidance Despite Chip-Boom Slowdown</p>",
