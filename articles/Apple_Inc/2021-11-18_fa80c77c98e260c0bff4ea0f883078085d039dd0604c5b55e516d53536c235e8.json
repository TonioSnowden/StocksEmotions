  "title": "Encrypted-Phone Company Demands U.S. Return Its Web Domains; In new complaint, Canadian company Sky Global said it was providing a legal product when it was forced to shut down by U.S. authorities in March",
  "text": "<p>The submission is accompanied by internal corporate documents detailing the operations of the company, which was essentially forced to shut down its security business earlier this year after its founder was charged with facilitating the distribution of drugs by selling a high-end encrypted secure phone that could be remotely wiped. Such phones are popular among criminals because their communications can't be intercepted in transit and their contents can be deleted if the device is seized by authorities.</p><p>The company relied in many cases on third-party resellers to distribute its devices. In the filing, Sky Global's lawyers provided emails and other corporate documents showing the company refusing to work with or suspending resellers who sold or said they planned to sell the devices to criminals. The company also denied user and distributor requests to wipe data from phones that had been seized by law enforcement, the documents show.</p><p>The company's lawyers also say Sky Global aims to reach a market including law enforcement, lawyers, celebrities and others with a heightened need for secure communications. Its terms of service explicitly barred users from engaging in criminal activity and forbade third-party resellers and distributors from providing phones in furtherance of illegal activity. In one case, the documents show Sky Global provided Canadian law-enforcement officials with its devices in the hopes of winning a contract with their agency.</p><p>In a indictment earlier this year, the government alleges that the company intentionally marketed its products to drug dealers and actively assisted in the obstruction of justice by deleting data from devices that had been seized by law enforcement.</p><p>\"The indictment alleges that Sky Global generated hundreds of millions of dollars providing a service that allowed criminal networks around the world to hide their international drug trafficking activity from law enforcement,\" Randy Grossman, the top federal prosecutor in San Diego, said at the time. \"Companies who do this are perpetuating the deadliest drug epidemic in our nation's history.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego declined to comment.</p><p>In its legal filing Tuesday, Sky Global said: \"Providing encrypted messaging solutions and protecting consumers' privacy rights is not illegal,\" adding, \"What has happened here is the equivalent of the government seizing Apple.com because drug dealers use iPhone encryption features to communicate with each other.\"</p><p>U.S. law-enforcement agencies say encrypted cellphone services are used by criminals to evade law enforcement and that all such products should contain backdoors for law enforcement to access data. Security researchers and privacy advocates say any such backdoors can be exploited by hackers and undermine the purpose of encryption, which is to protect data and privacy. Law-enforcement officials have said widespread consumer encryption—what some call \"going dark\"—is impeding the monitoring of potentially criminal communications.</p><p>Ordinary web services such as WhatsApp, Signal and most of Apple's consumer services are end-to-end encrypted—meaning that not even the companies can access user data. Companies like Sky Global offer additional security measures by modifying commercially available phones to remove cameras, microphones and GPS tracking.</p><p>The U.S. government has cracked down on the high-end encrypted phone companies, bringing cases in recent years to disrupt and infiltrate the companies that make and sell them. Prosecutors dismantled another Canadian technology company, Phantom Secure, in 2018, indicting executives for allegedly providing phones to criminal organizations. The company's CEO was sentenced to nine years in federal prison and the company's operations were dismantled.</p><p>After the Phantom Secure case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation secretly infiltrated Anom, another similar service in its infancy, winning the cooperation of its creator and building a backdoor into its services that let law enforcement world-wide monitor all communication of the system's users. The indictment the government filed in March against Mr. Eap, Sky Global's CEO, was nearly the same as the one used in the Phantom Secure case. Mr. Eap has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>After Sky's operations were disrupted, the FBI reported that several thousand of its users appear to have migrated to Anom, which was then being secretly run by the FBI. The bureau sprung its trap on the service's users in June, arresting hundreds of suspects who relied on the messaging service in a worldwide takedown.</p><p>Sky reported 120,000 active users before it was dismantled in March—while the FBI measured an influx of approximately 6,000 users to Anom after the company was dismantled. The company says that it was providing a legal service to a mostly law-abiding customer base.</p><p>\"Anyone concerned about privacy should be deeply troubled by how the government almost shut down a legitimate, law-abiding company that was attempting to address critical issues around data protection and privacy,\" said Ashwin Ram, an attorney for the company.</p><p>The case against Mr. Eap has remained in a state of limbo since it was filed in March. The U.S. government has made no attempt to extradite Mr. Eap, who is still in Canada. Mr. Eap offered to surrender to the U.S. government and come to the U.S. to resolve the charges but that offer wasn't accepted, according to a person familiar with the case. He remains free in Canada.</p><p>Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com</p><p>Encrypted-Phone Company Demands U.S. Return Its Web Domains</p>",
