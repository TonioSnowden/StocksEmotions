  "title": "An Atheist Director Walks Into a Marvel Movie Full of Gods…; 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is teeming with religious subtext. But director Taika Waititi has mixed feelings about faith.",
  "text": "<p>The movie involves a polytheistic who's who, with deities from Zeus to a God of Dumplings. Thor, of course, is the God of Thunder, who grapples with the duty of these higher powers as he battles a villain known as Gorr the God Butcher—a bereft father who felt ignored by the god he once prayed to.</p><p>It's a long way from the adventures of a rich guy in an armored suit.</p><p>Beginning with \"Iron Man\" in 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe took shape around familiar heroes saving Earth with powers from technology, science and alien worlds. In 2012's \"The Avengers,\" Captain America (made in a lab) took issue with a teammate describing Thor and his brother Loki as gods: \"There's only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that.\"</p><p>A decade later, gods are everywhere as the MCU expands into the wild pantheon created by comic book writers over decades. Conflicts now routinely play out on a celestial scale, with immortals serving a supreme space being (last year's \"The Eternals\") and mythological figures from ancient Egypt (the recent TV series \"Moon Knight\").</p><p>\"When you're working with concepts of cosmic deities, the themes of the shows and films tend to become about deciphering your purpose. The philosophy gets existential, and that is new territory for us\" in the MCU, says Brad Winderbaum, Marvel Studios head of streaming, television and animation, and a producer of \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\"</p><p>In Marvel's latest blockbuster, which grossed $143 million in North America over opening weekend, Christian Bale plays a character from a decimated planet whose people have perished, including his daughter. When he encounters the god his people worshiped, he bows down. \"Our faith in you never wavered,\" he says, \"and now we await the promise of the eternal reward.\" The deity laughs him off. That divine indifference (plus a cursed sword) triggers Gorr's vendetta.</p><p>In a movie that makes tonal leaps from comedy to sentimentality, Gorr is an intergalactic villain motivated by a relatable crisis of faith.</p><p>\"You understand the anger behind the drive,\" Mr. Waititi says.</p><p>In one satirical set piece, Thor and his comrades try to recruit help from the gods of lavish Omnipotent City. A condescending Zeus, played by Russell Crowe, presides with his lightning bolt.</p><p>Mr. Waititi says he initially wanted to add a cutaway shot of Jesus in the crowd of elite deities. Instead, the filmmakers went with an indirect namecheck when Tessa Thompson's character, Valkyrie, points out the \"God of Carpentry.\"</p><p>\"We're working with a world of fiction,\" Mr. Winderbaum says. \"We knew that would be distracting and probably take us off topic if we included deities that people actually pray to in everyday life.\"</p><p>Mr. Waititi, who wrote \"Love and Thunder\" with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, says a passing sight gag wasn't worth the questions it could have raised: \"Far better things to do than to defend me putting Jesus into a Marvel movie.\"</p><p>It gets confusing to ponder where Christian, Jewish or Muslim belief systems fit into the fantasy hierarchies. Still, religious leaders and scholars have found much symbolism to dig into, says Greg Stevenson, a professor of biblical studies at Rochester University, and editor of the book \"Theology and the Marvel Universe.\" Chapters include \"Gods Upon Gods: Hierarchies of Divinity in the Marvel Universe\" and his \"Spider-Man and the Theology of Weakness.\"</p><p>Superhero stories \"almost all deal with themes like redemption, sacrifice, good versus evil,\" he says, noting that the movies have seldom been as overt in their religious allusions as the new \"Thor\" is.</p><p>Gorr the God Butcher was created by comics writer Jason Aaron, who introduced the character in a run of Thor books starting in 2012. Mr. Aaron is an atheist who had been raised in the Southern Baptist church in Alabama, and has said Gorr grew out of his pessimism about religion.</p><p>In \"Love and Thunder,\" Gorr's beef with the gods boils down to their self-interest in glory and their indifference to the mortals who pray to them. \"I put my faith in a higher power hoping it would save her, and she died,\" he says of his daughter.</p><p>\"This has been a theological challenge for people of faith for centuries: How to deal with unanswered prayer. Does God care?\" says Mr. Stevenson, the bible scholar.</p><p>Like the comics writer behind the source material for \"Love and Thunder,\" Mr. Waititi is an atheist. \"I don't believe in man-made religions. I don't believe in man-made gods,\" the director says.</p><p>Wearing a black bucket hat with a yellow smiley face pin on it, he adds, \"I don't like to make people uncomfortable about faith. If it helps you spiritually, and to understand your place in the world, absolutely, by all means. And as an atheist, I still sometimes go, 'Am I doing the right thing?' Just in case it's all true.\"</p><p>\"Love and Thunder\" is his second Thor film after his comedic 2017 hit \"Thor: Ragnorak\" reinvigorated the franchise. He won an Oscar for the screenplay to his 2019 film \"Jojo Rabbit,\" in which he played Adolf Hitler as a boy's imaginary friend.</p><p>The New Zealand filmmaker is Jewish on his mother's side, though neither she nor her parents were religious believers, he says. He has Maori ancestry on his father's side, and says he puts more stock in indigenous beliefs, which include gods representing natural elements.</p><p>\"Our gods are more like the Greek gods. There are stories behind them and they mess with mortals,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Waititi is on the same page with scholars who say contemporary superheroes serve a similar purpose as figures of ancient myth, from Hercules to the Polynesian hero Maui. \"There were lessons in how to live within those stories, and how to be a better person. Some were cautionary tales, some to be just fun,\" the filmmaker says.</p><p>As for his latest Marvel saga, it's not a complete spoiler to say that the resolution for Gorr and Thor involves the first word in the subtitle \"Love and Thunder.\"</p><p>\"I think that's enough. That's good,\" Mr. Waititi says. \"To get any deeper just pisses people off, and becomes a boring movie.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at John.Jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>MORE TO WATCH</p><p>* Can Elvis Survive Gen Z?</p><p>* 'Top Gun: Maverick' Is an Ode to the Glorious Jerks of the 1980s</p><p>* Finally, Some Compassion for the Cranky Old Neighbor</p><p>* The Retro Cringe of Apple TV+'s 'Physical' and the '80s Workout Microgenre</p><p>* In 'Dark Winds,' Gritty '70s Crime in a Navajo Setting</p><p>An Atheist Director Walks Into a Marvel Movie Full of Gods…</p>",
