  "text": "<p>Despite the ICA's shoestring budget, tastemakers will be studying the museum's progress because the art world has long struggled to figure out what kind of art makes Silicon Valley tick. Art dealers and auctioneers routinely transform newly wealthy people into blue-chip collectors, but an expected surge in tech-millionaire spending on art hasn't happened in recent years. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has had some success in wrangling tech donors, but no major U.S. museum has yet fully harnessed the tech world's singular support.</p><p>\"The art world sees us as a bunch of bank accounts,\" said Yoz Labs co-founder Ethan Beard, who once worked for Facebook and Google, and is on the board of the new museum. \"A lot of what we build is code, so we're not building objects or trying to amass things. We just have a different view of status symbols.\"</p><p>For him, the chance to mentor a small museum from the ground up hewed closer to his skill set—and that's precisely what Ms. Gass offered him a year ago when she set out to open the ICA. The director previously ran the ICA San Jose and Chicago's Smart Museum of Art but said she's spent the past year seeking advice and support from those in tech—not the museum establishment—as she embarked on her new museum this time around.</p><p>\"I was still passionate about art, but I was worn out trying to turn the Titanic,\" she said of the traditional museum mind-set. \"It's time to set new patterns.\"</p><p>Rather than hire a starchitect and launch a multiyear fundraising campaign to get the ICA under way, she started with $1 million in seed money donated by venture capitalist Andy Rappaport and a 15-year building lease in the industrial neighborhood of Dogpatch. Since then, Ms. Gass said she has raised another $4 million mainly from the city's tech whales.</p><p>Nearly all her museum's board members or early donors claim tech credentials. These include Slack co-founder Cal Henderson and his wife, Rebecca Reeve Henderson; Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger and his wife, Kaitlyn Krieger; and former Apple engineer Jeff Dauber.</p><p>Ms. Gass said early chats with potential tech supporters taught her that accessibility and efficiency, not exclusivity, rank high with this set—and she's oriented her museum to suit.</p><p>In practice, this means that the ICA won't collect art but will instead commission and show pieces by emerging and overlooked artists, sidestepping acquisition and storage fees. This so-called kunsthalle model, favored in Germany and by a handful of non-collecting U.S. museums, also allows curators to organize exhibitions at a faster-than-typical clip. That's because they're working with living artists rather than basing shows on archival or curatorial research that can span years.</p><p>The museum's architecture is also intended to signal a \"not-too-precious\" atmosphere, Ms. Gass said. The 11,000-square-foot converted children's gymnasium has been reconfigured subtly by architect E.B. Min so that visitors don't feel like they're suddenly in a sleek showroom, she said. Some construction sawhorses have been converted into benches.</p><p>Artist Jeffrey Gibson was allowed to jackhammer a pair of 45-foot-long trenches into the museum's concrete floor for his inaugural show, \"This Burning World,\" a multimedia exploration of nature and the damage society has done to it. Elements will include a close-up look at that earth beneath the museum as well as a suspended, dying tree. Wall-spanning videos will also show the passing seasons interspersed with clips of indigenous singer Joan Henry.</p><p>Mr. Gibson, who is Choctaw and Cherokee, said the solo show pushed him beyond the beaded punching bags that have become his signature. \"It's the most ambitious project I've ever done,\" he said. \"When I'd ask if I could try something, Ali just kept saying yes.\"</p><p>David Hornik, a venture capitalist, said Ms. Gass also understands the nuanced way Silicon Valley prefers to extend its philanthropic largess. Millionaires in San Francisco don't uniformly drive fancy cars or necessarily want to flash matching rosters of trendy art stars, he said.</p><p>Mr. Hornik is a collector, and he has given art to more than a dozen museums—but he signed up to help fund the ICA because he thinks its carefree approach could make edgy art more inviting to the public. That potential impact is what he's looking for, he said.</p><p>\"Nothing about our industry is permanent, so if you're creating permanence, we're seeing trade-offs,\" Mr. Hornik said. \"Ali is saying she wants flexibility and experimentation, and to the community supporting this museum, that's music to our ears.\"</p><p>Ms. Gass said she's still learning what her tech backers expect from a museum, though. After Mr. Hornik and his wife, Pamela, agreed to fund the salary of one of her curators, Ms. Gass offered to name the endowed position after them. Naming rights are typically plum rewards for bigwig donors. The couple asked her not to.</p><p>\"The idea that another individual's position needs to be saddled to my name smacked of colonialism,\" he said. \"It made me feel terrible.\"</p><p>Ms. Gass said others have similarly shied from the chance to exercise naming rights over elements of the museum. Such exchanges are challenging her to cast about for other time-honored traditions within museum operations that she can rethink. The museum will offer free admission, for example, but people can also make donations in cryptocurrency.</p><p>\"I finally feel like I can take a meeting in a hoodie,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com</p><p>More in Art &amp; Auctions</p><p>* $70 Million in Art at MoMA to Be Sold to Extend Museum's Digital Reach</p><p>* Seoul—Not Hong Kong—Is the Newest Art Capital of the World</p><p>* Paul Allen's $1 Billion Art Collection Heads to Auction</p><p>* A Cherry-Red 1955 Ferrari Sells for $22 Million</p><p>* Ken Griffin on Why He Spent $43 Million to Buy the U.S. Constitution</p><p>Tech Titans Are Backing a Museum with a Taco Party, Not a Gala</p>",
