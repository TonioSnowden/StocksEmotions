  "text": "<p>In the first, baffling days of the pandemic, when we were all grasping at straws, a friend told me gargling with salt and water would be a defence. At least it's an idea with some pedigree. Salt has been associated with health from earliest times: the Chinese used it to cleanse wounds, Hippocrates healed ailments with it and the Romans called their goddess of health, Salus, after it.</p> <p>As nations of crisp lovers can attest, salt is also tasty. But its role in food preservation is what turned this humble condiment into a cornerstone of civilisation. The Egyptians were first to discover salt could mask the taste of rotting food and lengthen its shelf life. That eased the reliance on seasonal produce and meant food could be transported across long distances.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because it was scarce — salt deposits were often as deep as 350 metres below ground — salt was valuable; the ancient Greeks equated it to gold and some societies used it as a form of currency. It became a global commodity, leading to taxes, trade wars and salt empires from Venice to Salzburg, China to Cheshire. It was regarded as a symbol of purity and immortality.</p> <p>Such a prize needed something grand to sit in. In the Elizabethan era, every respectable table had its salt cellar. This one, made of silver with gilded bands, would have been owned by someone of “the middling sort” but they could be more elaborate: in his diary of 1625, King Charles admired a gold one studded with sapphires, rubies, pearls and emeralds.&#xa0;</p> <p>In medieval times, before spoons were common, French nobles reportedly grew a fingernail to scoop the salt out of the cellar. By the 16th century, salt and social class were firmly entwined: prestigious banquet guests would be seated between the salt cellar and the host, while the less exalted were placed further away from it — “below the salt”.&#xa0;</p> <p>This cellar was part of a silver collection belonging to Ernest Cassel, a German Jew who arrived in Liverpool in 1869 with a violin and bag of clothes. He went on to become a financier and adviser to Edward VII. When his granddaughter married a Mountbatten, this became the family silver.</p> <p>Industrial mining democratised salt, and the glory days of the salt cellar were numbered. In 1858, the American tinsmith John Mason invented the salt shaker, heralding a strange new phenomenon — the novelty salt and pepper set, in renditions ranging from penguins and toadstools to basset hounds and Buddhas. The dining table would never be the same.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.museumofthehome.org.uk/\"><em>museumofthehome.org.uk</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
