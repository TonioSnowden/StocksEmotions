  "text": "<p>Cook added that Apple AAPL executives \"believe strongly in investing for the long term\" and that they \"don't believe you can save your way to prosperity.\"</p><p>His comments come on the heels of Meta Platforms Inc.'s META announcement last Wednesday that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees as it strives to \"become a leaner and more efficient company.\" Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the Facebook parent company, added in that announcement that Meta would be extending a hiring freeze through the first quarter of next year.</p><p>Other tech companies including Snap Inc. SNAP, Shopify Inc. SHOP and Peloton Interactive Inc. PTON have also announced layoffs in recent months. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN announced in early November that it would put a \"pause on new incremental hires in our corporate workforce\" that is expected to last a few months.</p><p>Cook also described Apple's philosophy on employees returning to the office, commenting that the nature of the company means that people \"have to hold [the] product\" and \"collaborate with one another.\" With that in mind, he said he sees value in the serendipity of in-person interactions, although he noted that Apple employees aren't in the office five days a week and that on Fridays, the company's offices resemble a \"ghost town.\"</p><p>Shares of Apple are down 1% in Monday morning trading. They've lost 17% so far this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has fallen 7%.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook says company is still hiring but being 'very deliberate'</p>",
