  "title": "Hillary Clinton spotlights remarkable women in Gutsy — TV review",
  "text": "<p>Any political soothsayers predicting that Hillary Clinton might make a third run for office in 2024 will almost certainly be disabused of that notion on watching the first episode of her new Apple TV Plus docu-series<em>.</em> Attending a clowning workshop in Paris, the former US secretary of state gamely dons a red nose and a novelty hat — the kind of optics that a presidential hopeful, you'd think, would seek to avoid.</p> <p>Why is Hillary Clinton attending a clowning workshop in Paris? A reasonable question, and not one for which there is a particularly compelling answer. This surreal scene can be found in <em>Gutsy</em>, an eight-part show developed and fronted by Clinton and her daughter Chelsea, in which they speak to inspiring, formidable and courageous women from all walks of life. Some of these meetings — such as one with a woman who was shot 10 times only to survive and open a self-defence class for teen girls — are moving and illuminating testimonies to the resilience of everyday women. Other encounters, like one at the all-female clowning academy at the Moulin Rouge, would perhaps have been more at home in an anodyne travelogue show.</p> <p>For all its worthiness, <em>Gutsy</em> is repeatedly undermined by its inability to decide on what it wants to be. While it's true that the series intends to showcase women in all their infinite variety — there are meetings with comedians, celebrities, athletes, firefighters, writers, rights campaigners, counsellors, mothers and beyond — this doesn't sufficiently account for how unfocused each episode feels as it jumps from one segment or one theme to the next, creating jarring tonal shifts.</p> <p>For instance, in the third instalment a serious discussion about the overly punitive Reagan-era policing of drug addicts is diluted by a following “bit” in which Hillary takes on Kim Kardashian in a quiz about law terms. By contrast, a conversation with the pioneering feminist activist Gloria Steinem feels squandered on topics such as Hollywood's leading ladies.</p> <p>If there's a messy, scattershot quality to the show's execution, then there's too much polish in the Clintons' interactions. They engage in some semi-scripted walk-and-talk banter, responding eagerly and earnestly to both banalities and original insight alike, but remain largely guarded whenever chats turn to their own personal experiences. That said, <em>the scandal </em>is indeed discussed — with a woman of the cloth no less. </p> <p>Still, even if <em>Gutsy</em> doesn't suggest that Clinton's future lies in television, her enthusiasm for giving a platform to many unheralded, remarkable women and their social causes seems pretty unimpeachable.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Episodes 1-2 on Apple TV Plus now; new episodes released on Fridays</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Hillary Clinton spotlights remarkable women in Gutsy — TV review' FT.com 14 September.
