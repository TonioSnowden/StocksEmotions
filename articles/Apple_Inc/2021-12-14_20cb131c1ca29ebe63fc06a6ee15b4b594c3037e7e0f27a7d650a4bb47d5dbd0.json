The issue had been escalated to Twitter Inc., and the tweet should be ignored, the office said. </p><p>\n  Twitter said its systems weren't breached in the hack. A Twitter investigation showed no other accounts appeared to be affected, a spokeswoman said. </p><p>\n  Twitter recommends that to protect their accounts people take steps such as activating two-factor authentication, requiring not just a password but also a second form of identification to log in, such as a code sent via an app. A spokeswoman declined to provide specifics on the degree to which Mr. Modi's account was protected. </p><p>\n  An Indian government official said rigorous security measures were taken to protect the account. </p><p>\n  The hack came after the Indian government last month said it would consider a bill to prohibit private cryptocurrencies in India, with some exceptions, and create an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India, according to a parliamentary bulletin. </p><p>\n  -- Newley Purnell </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  HONG KONG </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tycoon Sentenced </p><p>\n  For Tiananmen Vigil </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A Hong Kong court on Monday sentenced activist and business tycoon Jimmy Lai to 13 months in jail for urging participation in last year's banned Tiananmen vigil, amid a crackdown by Chinese authorities that has rolled back the semiautonomous city's civil liberties. The District Court convicted seven others on similar charges and handed out sentences of up to 14 months. </p><p>\n  Hong Kong's government has banned the vigil for the past two years on pandemic control grounds, although it is believed the ban is intended to be permanent as authorities look to squelch the city's pro-democracy movement. </p><p>\n  Mr. Lai is the founder of the now-closed pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  INDONESIA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Wave Alert Follows </p><p>\n  7.3 Undersea Quake </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A magnitude-7.3 undersea earthquake struck off Indonesias Flores Island early on Tuesday, and the country's meteorological agency warned that tsunami waves are possible. </p><p>\n  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake hit at a depth of 11.5 miles under the sea, and was located 74 miles north of the town of Maumere, the second-largest on the island in East Nusa Tenggara province with a population of 85,000. </p><p>\n  There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii later lifted a regional tsunami alert. </p><p>\n  TV footage from the area showed people running from buildings that shook from the impact. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
