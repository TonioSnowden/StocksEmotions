  "text": "<p>Apple's changes, which went into effect last year, have already upended the digital-ad industry and contributed to a wipeout of more than $300 billion from Meta's market value.</p><p>Google said Wednesday that it plans to develop more privacy-focused replacements for the alphanumeric identifiers associated with individual smartphones that some apps use to gather and share information about users.</p><p>The Alphabet Inc. unit said it plans to keep supporting current smartphone identifiers for at least the next two years and to give the industry substantial notice before any changes. It said it plans to work with the industry to develop the replacements.</p><p>Google declined to give many details about its plans for how its new systems would work. What they might look like for users or advertisers remained unclear.</p><p>The open-ended approach could help Google reduce anxiety from marketers and scrutiny from regulators, from whom it received substantial blowback when it said in 2020 that it aimed to phase out support for web-browser identifiers called third-party cookies within two years. Google was later forced to delay that timeline.</p><p>\"We don't think there should be a forced choice between privacy and developers building their business,\" said Anthony Chavez, vice president, product management for Android security and privacy.</p><p>The changes come as the practice of tracking users for digital advertising faces increased scrutiny in Europe from regulators who are examining the legality of certain kinds of targeted advertising.</p><p>Smartphone apps, which range from news and videogames to women's ovulation trackers, share a string of letters and numbers connected to an individual device that allows ad-tech companies to infer users' interests from their online behaviors, powering an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year.</p><p>Last year Apple moved to curtail those practices across iPhones by prompting users to allow or prevent an app from tracking them. U.S. users opted out of tracking more than 80% of the time, according to the mobile-app analytics provider Flurry, causing mobile ad prices on iPhones to plunge and Android ad prices to rise.</p><p>Google's decision to make changes in the wake of Apple's actions last year has the potential of turning the challenge to the marketing and app-development business into more of a global predicament. The iPhone maker has about a 50% share of the smartphone market in the U.S., while Google's Android operating system is used by 85% of smartphone owners world-wide, including customers of Samsung Electronics Co.</p><p>Meta's Facebook, which has been critical of Apple's privacy change, saying it will cost the company $10 billion this year in lost sales, struck a different tone on Google's proposal. \"Encouraging to see this long-term, collaborative approach to privacy-protective personalized advertising from Google,\" tweeted Dennis Buchheim, Meta's vice president of advertising ecosystem, speaking on behalf of the company. \"We look forward to continued work with them and the ecosystem on privacy-enhancing tech through industry groups.\"</p><p>Two key reasons that Meta is less concerned about Google's proposal than Apple's privacy change is that the search giant has provided a longer timeline to implement its proposal and is taking a collaborative approach, according to a person familiar with Meta's thinking on the matter. Facebook has defended its targeting practices, saying that users appreciate seeing ads relevant to them and that its technology enables marketers to reach precise slices of potential customers.</p><p>Some ad tech executives said that Google's long time frame for making changes to device identifiers could give the mobile ad industry cause for relief -- given the impact of Apple's changes and the expectation that Google would eventually follow suit.</p><p>\"Two years is an eternity in tech and effectively Google is saying you don't have to worry about it for two years,\" said Ari Paparo, an ad tech executive who sold his company to Comcast Corp.</p><p>In a blog post, Google criticized Apple's approach to improving privacy, calling it ineffective and pointing to a security app's blog post saying it failed to limit tracking across apps. The search company said its goal is to create \"privacy enhancing advertising solutions, where users know their information is protected, and developers and businesses have the tools to succeed on mobile.\"</p><p>Mr. Chavez said Google will collect feedback on future proposals from developers, privacy advocates, regulators and other interested parties in the coming months and begin beta-testing proposed changes by year-end. It will scale up its testing in 2023, he said.</p><p>Google said the app-tracking replacements it plans to develop for phones will work similarly to those it is proposing for web browsers, where it plans to replace tracking technology called third-party cookies.In one proposed replacement, users' Android devices will track app usage and analyze it on the devices, rather than sending raw usage information to outside companies. The phones will then tell third parties the user's interests so they can be targeted with ads without the advertisers knowing that user's phone identifier.</p><p>Google's changes will be watched closely by rivals and regulators because of its power over the digital-ad economy. Google has promised to give the U.K.'s competition regulator oversight of its removal of support for third-party cookies.</p>",
