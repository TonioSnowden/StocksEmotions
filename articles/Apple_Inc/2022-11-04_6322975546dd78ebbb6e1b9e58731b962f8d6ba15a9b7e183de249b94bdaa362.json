  "title": "Meta's Clegg Backs Pivot to Metaverse",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said he was pleased to see that Mr. Musk said he plans to create a moderation council with diverse viewpoints to help Twitter make content decisions.</p><p>Mr. Clegg was speaking at the Fortune CEO Initiative. During the conversation, he also took shots at rivals TikTok and Apple Inc., and defended his company's pivot to the metaverse.</p><p>Mr. Clegg said articles describing Meta's business as failing are \"lazy headline caricature,\" and he emphasized that the company has more daily users than ever and is yet to monetize most of its features.</p><p>\"The core business of the existing apps is actually incredibly healthy,\" Mr. Clegg said.</p><p>Meta shares are down more than 70% this year, in part because of investor concerns about the company continuing to spend tens of billions of dollars on the metaverse, a strategic pivot that won't pay dividends for years at best.</p><p>\"It does take time, it does take patience, it does take investment,\" Mr. Clegg said.</p><p>On Apple, which last year instituted changes to its ad-tracking policies that badly hurt Meta's business, Mr. Clegg said he believes regulators are rightfully paying more attention to whether those moves are anticompetitive.</p><p>\"I don't think Apple will get away with this scot-free,\" Mr. Clegg said, adding that the Silicon Valley rival often couches its moves as being in service of privacy.</p><p>Just as often, he added, the result is \"Apple doing a fair amount of damage to some of their competitors when it comes to online advertising and then building up their own advertising.\"</p><p>In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said: \"A user's data belongs to them and they should get to decide whether to share their data and with whom.\" The spokesperson added that the company has \"received strong support from regulators and privacy advocates for this new feature.\"</p><p>Asked about upstart social-media rival TikTok Inc., Mr. Clegg said Chinese tech companies are able to operate in the U.S. while still being able to tap into China's vast consumer market, whereas U.S. companies such as Meta can't do both.</p><p>TikTok executives have said they are working with the U.S. government on an agreement that would satisfy all national-security concerns.</p>",
