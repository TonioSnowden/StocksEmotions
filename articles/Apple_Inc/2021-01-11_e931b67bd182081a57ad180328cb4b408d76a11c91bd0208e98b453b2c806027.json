  "text": "<p>   GWYNN'S ISLAND, Va. -- On Doug Sweet's first trip to the U.S. Capitol, as a 13-year-old in 1975, he tilted his head back, gazed up at the glistening white dome and thought it was the most awesome thing he had ever seen. </p><p>   On his second trip to the Capitol, he joined a mob of Trump supporters who smashed their way into the seat of the U.S. Congress, and finished his visit handcuffed facedown on the floor. </p><p>   The 45-year journey between those two visits was marked by bright idealism and belief in dark conspiracies, by a solitary existence and a newfound fraternity with those convinced there is no way Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. </p><p>   It didn't matter that no evidence of widespread election fraud emerged, or that more than 50 legal claims filed by the Trump campaign have been dismissed  by courts. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet put his faith in Mr. Trump and his allies, who for weeks had implored followers to rise up against the outcome of a national election they said was rigged. </p><p>   \"He said, 'Hey, I need my digital soldiers to show up on January 6,'\" Mr. Sweet says of the president. \"And we all did.\" </p><p>   The mob that stormed the Capitol last Wednesday was a combustible stew of QAnon conspiracy theorists, armed rampagers and extremist personalities, as well as more ordinary Trump loyalists determined to fulfill the president's desire to persuade -- or intimidate -- lawmakers into undoing his election loss. </p><p>   Among those who have been arrested are a leader of the far-right Proud Boys for his alleged role in the siege, and an online provocateur and white nationalist who live-streamed from inside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. A Capitol Police officer was killed and four others died. </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal interviewed Mr. Sweet at his home after police included him on a list of those arrested. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet is a man who dipped his toe in the pool of wild and false conspiracies during the Barack Obama administration and is now up to his neck in it, wallowing in resentment and anger that others can't see how the elites are scheming to destroy America the way he can. He has become intractably fixated on beliefs so extreme -- but widespread -- that he is estranged from his elder daughter. </p><p>   He came to Washington ready to act on them. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet and a friend first visited the Ellipse, where President Donald Trump told his supporters that the election had been stolen and that he planned to walk with them along Pennsylvania Avenue to take their anger to the Capitol. </p><p>   \"We fight like hell,\" the president said. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet says he took his marching orders from the president and walked east. The Capitol was a battlefield when he arrived in early afternoon. </p><p>   People waving Trump flags and wearing MAGA hats were swarming the bleachers erected for Mr. Biden's inauguration. They were scrambling up the walls. Rioters had overrun Capitol Police and forced their way into the building. Mr. Sweet could hear the thuds and see the smoke from flash-bang grenades going off inside. </p><p>   He says he walked up stairs on the Mall side of the Capitol, where he found the doors open. He says he hesitated. He says he felt the need to go inside to share his views with Congress but wanted to consult God first. He prayed aloud: \"Lord, is this the right thing to do? Is this what I need to do?\" He says he felt God's hand on his back, pushing him forward. </p><p>   \"I checked with the Lord,\" he says. \"I never heard a 'No.'\" </p><p>   He walked in and, he says, found himself in a whirlwind of broken glass and debris. He says he was shocked; the event on the Ellipse had been all picnic blankets and puppies. This was an orgy of destruction. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet, 58, lives alone in a wood-heated house on a lot crowded with tractors and old boats on Gwynn's Island, a short walk from the Chesapeake Bay. </p><p>   He's usually up at 5 a.m. and in bed by 9 p.m. A lot of days his only conversation during the hours in between is with Jenkins, his aging Labrador. </p><p>   For 40 years he has pieced together a living, a far cry from the path taken by his father, an aeronautical engineer who developed satellites for NASA during the Cold War space race and died when Mr. Sweet was in high school. </p><p>   After graduating from Mathews High School in 1980, he operated a crane and forklift for a decade in the Newport News shipyards. He tried his hand at landscaping and did a stint on a tugboat and another fishing for oysters on the Rappahannock River. </p><p>   A divorce left him with custody of his two daughters, so in 1996 he took up odd jobs welding and doing carpentry to remain on dry land. A garage-building business collapsed in the crash of 2008. </p><p>   These days he earns a thin living mowing grass in the summer and selling oak firewood in the winter, filling his larder with deer he shoots and striped bass he catches. He is on Medicaid, but says he doesn't use it. </p><p>   There were a couple of run-ins with the law along the way -- a fistfight with his brother, who dropped the charges, and a six-month suspended sentence after he hit his older daughter, Robyn Sweet, then 14. It was an act he describes as a spanking and that she prefers not to discuss. \"I think he did his best, but it was very dysfunctional,\" Ms. Sweet says of her childhood. </p><p>   A Richard Nixon fan, Bill Clinton's presidency deepened Mr. Sweet's dislike of Democrats. Friends from Arkansas told him Mr. Clinton was \"one of the biggest cocaine smugglers in the U.S,\" a partner in crime with Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar. Mr. Sweet found the false allegations plausible. </p><p>   In 2008 he voted for GOP candidate John McCain, the senator from Arizona. He preferred the Republican vice presidential pick, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whose beliefs and attitude reflected his own self-image as a \"Tea Party Patriot.\" </p><p>   Nonetheless, he says he was \"kind of excited\" that the country got its first Black president, Barack Obama. He soon concluded, however, that Mr. Obama was actively \"trying to destroy the country,\" citing infrastructure spending and the cash-for-clunkers program. </p><p>   Donald Trump caught his eye. Here was a businessman who told it like it was, he thought, not a politician. \"He's not a perfect man, but we haven't seen a perfect man since Christ,\" Mr. Sweet says. </p><p>   One thing he liked was Mr. Trump's defense of Confederate war memorials. </p><p>   In 2017, Mr. Sweet went to Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally, a protest against the removal of a statue of rebel Gen. Robert E. Lee. The event devolved into violence, with neo-Nazis shouting anti-Semitic slogans and a white nationalist plowing his car through a crowd and killing a counter-protester, Heather Heyer. Mr. Sweet thinks Democrats staged the clashes to make anyone \"pro-Confederate\" seem like a Ku Klux Klan racist. No evidence has backed up that theory. </p><p>   Afterwards, Mr. Trump defended the statue. That resonated with Mr. Sweet, who felt Mr. Trump was trying to \"preserve America.\" </p><p>   Two years ago, Mr. Sweet helped found an activist group called the East Coast Hiwaymen. He saw the organization's mission as defending Confederate war memorials, while also undertaking charity drives. </p><p>   Initially the East Coast Hiwaymen had some 30 members, he says. During the summer of 2019, they spent many weekends forming a protective shield around the 27-foot statue of a Confederate soldier in front of the courthouse in Pittsboro, N.C. </p><p>   Members grew demoralized after spending gas and meals only to see the statue come down. </p><p>   \"Some people can't accept losing,\" Mr. Sweet says. </p><p>   Mr. Sweet professes a series of beliefs about the powerful manipulating the world in ways visible only to those able to see through the deception. \"There are so many people walking around half asleep,\" he says. In Mr. Sweet's world of false conspiracies, financier George Soros is both a Nazi and a Communist who pays leftist activists to burn and loot American cities. QAnon, a conspiracy-theory group that believes Mr. Trump is under assault by devil worshipers, speaks the truth. A Washington pizza parlor serves pies made of children's blood to Satanists who know to order off-menu. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Pelosi drink children's blood in a quest for eternal youth. </p><p>   \"I'm not going to go open a court case saying [Ms. Clinton] eats children,\" Mr. Sweet says. \"But I can believe that she might eat children.\" </p><p>   Robyn Sweet says she has been saddened and puzzled to see her father's views grow more extreme. She says she loves him and still sees his good qualities, calling him \"charismatic, lovable and funny outside of all this.\" Yet she says he has become someone she doesn't quite recognize. </p><p>   \"I don't know this person anymore,\" she says.  She says their relationship has become increasingly strained \"because it just seems so crazy some of the stuff he would talk about.\" </p><p>   Ms. Sweet marched in support of Black Lives Matter in June after the killing of George Floyd in police custody, and started a Facebook page to highlight bigotry. She says her father supported her exercise of her constitutional right to free speech, but some people \"in his camp\" began accusing her of \"being antifa,\" a loose collection of sometimes-violent left-wing activists. </p><p>   \"She's caught up in the idea that BLM goes into cities and helps Black children,\" Mr. Sweet says. \"We're polar opposites. But I love her.\" </p><p>   This summer, Mr. Sweet became more active at Gwynn's Island Baptist Church, where, due to pandemic concerns, congregants listened to services from their cars and honked their horns to say amen. </p><p>   In July, Mr. Sweet demonstrated his growing faith with a baptismal dip in the Chesapeake Bay. </p><p>   \"His priorities changed, and he got very committed to church,\" says Pastor Ed Jordan. He describes Mr. Sweet as a passionate \"patriot\" who talked about being \"concerned for our country.\" </p><p>   Mr. Sweet's distrust of those in power colors the way he sees the 2020 election results. \"We always knew there was something funny going on with elections,\" he says. </p><p></p>",
