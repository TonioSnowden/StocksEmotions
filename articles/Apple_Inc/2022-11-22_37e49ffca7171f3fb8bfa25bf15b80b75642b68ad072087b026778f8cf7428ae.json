  "title": "Sequoia Capital Apologizes to Its Fund Investors for FTX Loss; Venture-capital firm tells fund investors that it will improve due diligence on future investments after $150 million loss on crypto exchange",
  "text": "<p>Sequoia Capital, an early backer of Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and Airbnb Inc., has long been seen as the gold standard in the venture industry for its high investment bar. The firm earlier this month wrote off its entire investment in FTX—one of the largest written by a venture firm in the company—after the crypto exchange struggled to meet a wave of withdrawals. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11.</p><p>In the call, a Sequoia partner said that the firm in the future will be in a position to have even early-stage startups' financial statements audited by one of the Big Four accounting firms, the people said.</p><p>Sequoia was one of scores of venture investors who piled roughly $2 billion into FTX amid last year's boom in crypto investment. Eager to get into the hot startup, they shirked traditional corporate controls such as external board oversight that are typical for such large investments.</p><p>In the call, Sequoia partners said the firm conducted due diligence on FTX but believed it was misled by the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, on the exchange's connections with Alameda Research based on recent bankruptcy filings, the people said.</p><p>FTX, based in the Bahamas, and its U.S. arm used a pair of smaller auditing firms to sign off on their 2021 financial statements earlier this year, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal, and the executive hired to shepherd FTX through bankruptcy has expressed \"substantial concerns\" about the quality of FTX's audited statements.</p><p>The ties between FTX and Alameda were central to FTX's implosion. Mr. Bankman-Fried has told investors and employees that FTX loaned customer funds to Alameda, which lost billions of dollars after crypto prices fell earlier this year. He told investors FTX faced a funding gap of up to $8 billion.</p><p>Sequoia invested the bulk of its cash in a Series B funding round for FTX in July 2021, when investor fervor for cryptocurrency startups hit an all-time high, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Attracted to a founder they saw as visionary, investors put aside customary oversight safeguards when backing FTX, which earlier this year was valued at $32 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups in the world.</p><p>When Sequoia and other shareholders asked for a seat on the company's board of directors, Mr. Bankman-Fried repeatedly pushed back, telling them their ownership in the company was too small to warrant it, people familiar with the matter said. Boards typically have to approve transactions with so-called related parties like Alameda.</p><p>John J. Ray, the restructuring specialist who replaced Mr. Bankman-Fried as CEO of FTX and helped oversee some of the biggest bankruptcies ever, including Enron's, said in a filing that he had never seen \"such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information\" as FTX.</p><p>Sequoia's conference call Tuesday was an extraordinary event for the 50-year-old firm, according to the people familiar with the matter. Sequoia rarely addresses its broader group of investors outside of routine update calls and in-person conferences, the people said.</p><p>The swift decline of FTX has amplified a rare moment of discontent from Sequoia's fund investors over some of its recent decisions, the people familiar said.</p><p>During the recent tech bull market, Sequoia and other Silicon Valley firms broadened beyond the traditional venture-capital model of buying up large stakes in young startups in exchange for board seats and detailed financial information. Instead, they raised larger funds to be able to get in on deals at higher valuations and make more daring bets.</p><p>Last fall, Sequoia announced a new structure designed to allow the firm to hold its shares in top-performing companies long after they go public, a move that came shortly before a broader selloff in technology stocks that hurt the value of Sequoia's technology holdings.</p><p>As a part of the structure, Sequoia asked fund investors to reinvest shares into a new fund that included public stock positions if they wanted to keep their existing allocations in Sequoia's venture funds, the people familiar said. Investors who opted in to the change ended up taking large losses amid the tech stock rout.</p><p>Sequoia Capital has said its investors agreed to roll over 95% of eligible balances into the new fund that includes public stocks, indicating enthusiasm for the approach, and that it was taking a long-term view.</p><p>In a note sent to fund investors on Nov. 9, Sequoia said that the fund that backed FTX had $7.5 billion worth of real and paper gains and that the FTX investment accounted for less than 3% of the committed capital for the fund.</p><p>Until earlier this month, FTX had a prominent place on Sequoia's website. An article showed the firm's partners' reactions to meeting Mr. Bankman-Fried, including an internal message from an unnamed Sequoia partner who wrote, \"I LOVE THIS FOUNDER.\" The article also mentioned that Mr. Bankman-Fried was playing a videogame when pitching Sequoia.</p><p>When FTX declared bankruptcy earlier this month, Sequoia also edited another post for a crypto investment called LayerZero. An earlier version said the Sequoia partnership approved the investment just 48 hours after an investment memo was completed. The newer version removed references to the fast decision-making.</p><p>—Eliot Brown and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com</p><p>Sequoia Capital Apologizes to Its Fund Investors for FTX Loss</p>",
