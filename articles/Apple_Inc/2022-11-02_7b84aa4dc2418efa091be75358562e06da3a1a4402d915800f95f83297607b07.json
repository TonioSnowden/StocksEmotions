  "title": "Amazon Adds More Ad-Free Music and Podcasts to Prime",
  "text": "<p>Starting Tuesday, Prime members, who have so far been able to listen to about 2 million songs for free, have access to 100 million songs -- the same full catalog offered on paid streaming audio services.</p><p>The tech giant is essentially offering its Prime members the full functionality of Spotify's free tier but without ads. While paid tiers allow users to select any specific song on demand, free tiers are more limited in that users can only listen by shuffling albums, playlists and artists' catalogs. Amazon also offers Prime users a few all-access playlists to which they can listen to on demand.</p><p>Amazon Music has long benefited from its placement under its Prime membership umbrella. The third-largest music service by subscriptions, behind Spotify and Apple Music, Amazon has drawn a diverse and older listening base across the U.S. -- many of them first-time streamers -- in large part through its Prime subscription service and voice-activated Echo speakers, analysts and executives say. Listeners can also access music and podcasts through the Amazon Music app.</p><p>The new music and podcasts for Prime members mark another challenge to music streaming competitors such as Apple Inc.'s Apple Music, which raised its monthly subscription fee by a dollar last week, and Spotify Technology SA, whose Chief Executive Daniel Ek said last week that it would likely raise prices in 2023.</p><p>By offering the music to Prime members without ads, Amazon will have to shoulder a potentially higher cost of payments to record labels depending on how much more users stream.</p><p>Amazon also is rolling out free access for members to a selection of podcasts, ad-free, including most of its Wondery catalog of premium shows as well as top shows from the New York Times, Barstool Sports, NPR, Slate, ESPN and other major publishers.</p><p>---</p><p>Sebastian Herrera contributed to this article.</p>",
