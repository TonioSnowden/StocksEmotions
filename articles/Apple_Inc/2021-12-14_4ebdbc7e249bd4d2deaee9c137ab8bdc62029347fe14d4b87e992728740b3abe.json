Top Stories Today is an audio news digest that gets you up to speed on the day's headlines.</em></p> <p>The Omicron coronavirus variant has been discovered for the first time on mainland China, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0457f43-0e8b-4ce8-8fda-f32fc77e8905\">according to health authorities</a>, piling pressure on officials already contending with an outbreak in one of the country's most important manufacturing hubs.</p> <p>Officials and state media said the Omicron case was “imported” by an arrival in the port city of Tianjin, south-east of Beijing, where travellers are quarantined before they are allowed to continue on to the Chinese capital.</p> <p>President Xi Jinping's administration is pursuing a “zero Covid” policy across the world's most populous nation, in part because of concerns about the relatively low efficacy of China's homemade vaccines and the potential death toll if Covid-19 spread freely among the country's 1.4bn people.</p> <p>China has reported only about 100,000 confirmed Covid cases since the virus emerged in Wuhan almost two years ago — less than the number of daily cases in the US and UK. </p> <p>The discovery of Omicron in Tianjin came as tens of thousands of people in China have been subjected to new lockdowns owing to Covid-19 outbreaks. Authorities are rushing to contain dozens of cases in the Yangtze river delta, a vital manufacturing centre. </p> <p>The cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo — all in Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai — have reported almost 200 new cases this week, prompting authorities to impose restrictions on movement until March 2022.</p> <p>The first report of an Omicron case in China comes as the highly transmissible variant, first discovered in southern Africa, begins to take hold in Europe. </p> <p>New infections in the UK are running at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a93e2e3-d414-4e3e-9bc7-16b3f9a2da8c\">200,000 a day</a>, according to an estimate from the UK Health Security Agency, and is expected to become the dominant variant in London in the coming days. The UK reported its first death from the Omicron variant yesterday. </p> <p>Denmark is also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c27c135-fdbc-4db7-8c7c-6e1f6c386235\">seeing a surge</a> in Omicron cases and its health authority said it expected the variant to become dominant this week.</p> <p>Epidemiologists say the UK and Denmark, which both have sophisticated&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4597ede8-f698-483a-81a2-1a9610be9784\">genetic sequencing</a>&#xa0;operations, offer an early warning of how infections and hospital admission rates could spike across Europe this winter and show the need for effective booster programmes to be in place.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
