  "title": "Biden to Say in Prime-Time Address Democracy Is at Stake in Midterm Elections; President plans to use Philadelphia speech to frame stakes for November; Republicans say he epitomizes divisiveness",
  "text": "<p>Democrats hold narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, and Mr. Biden is seeking to turn the elections into a choice for voters between his party and that of Republicans, who have criticized his leadership and have said Democrats are trying to distract from the more central issues of inflation and economic unrest.</p><p>\"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards. Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love,\" Mr. Biden planned to say, according to excerpts of the speech released in advance by the White House.</p><p>The Republican National Committee said in a statement that Mr. Biden was \"the divider-in-chief and epitomizes the current state of the Democrat Party: one of divisiveness, disgust, and hostility towards half the country.\"</p><p>The speech is one of three visits Mr. Biden is making to Pennsylvania, a top battleground state with closely watched races for governor and the Senate, in the course of a week. Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in the state for GOP candidates Saturday.</p><p>Mr. Biden and White House officials have been more direct in recent weeks in criticizing what they have called \"ultra-MAGA\" Republicans, referring to Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan, and the spreading of false claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.</p><p>During a Maryland fundraiser last week, Mr. Biden described Mr. Trump and his allies' approach to governing as \"like semi-fascism\" and said they threatened American democracy. He has sought to draw a distinction between Republicans allied with Mr. Trump and others in the Republican party he says he can work with.</p><p>A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found identical shares of Republicans and Democrats—69% apiece—said they believed \"the nation's democracy is in danger of collapse,\" though likely for very different reasons.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think are the most important issues facing the U.S. right now? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Other surveys have shown declining faith among Republicans in the electoral system, with many echoing Mr. Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Democrats say Republicans are just rejecting election results they don't like, most notably in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol by Trump supporters.</p><p>Republicans have accused Mr. Biden of seeking to divide the nation and dismiss millions of Americans who supported Mr. Trump while attempting to play down high rates of inflation and crime ahead of the midterms.</p><p>Ahead of the president's address, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Thursday in West Pittston, Pa., near Mr. Biden's boyhood hometown of Scranton, that the president's tenure has been \"a time of trial for Americans everywhere\" and accused Mr. Biden of launching an assault on the soul of America.</p><p>\"I, along with every Republican running for Congress this year, share your unwavering conviction that we must change direction in Washington before it is too late,\" Mr. McCarthy said.</p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Mr. Biden thinks \"there is an extremist threat to our democracy\" and that the president felt obligated to speak out against such a threat.</p><p>The senior White House official said the speech wouldn't be about \"a particular politician or even about a particular political party,\" but rather the threats to democracy and the opportunities for the nation if it moves forward with its democratic principles.</p><p>Mr. Biden spoke about restoring the \"soul of the nation\" during his 2020 campaign and has expressed concerns about democracy and voting rights throughout his presidency. His language targeting Republicans has grown sharper as the midterms approach.</p><p>At a Tuesday speech in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., focused on public safety, he criticized Republicans for defending the rioters that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.</p><p>\"Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you won't condemn what happened on the 6th,\" Mr. Biden said. \"You can't be pro law enforcement and pro insurrection.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump told a conservative radio host on Thursday that if he were to run for president again in 2024 and win, he would issue pardons to the rioters.</p><p>\"We'll be looking very, very seriously at full pardons,\" Mr. Trump told host Wendy Bell. \"And I mean full pardons with an apology—to many, an apology. They've been so badly treated.\"</p><p>Separately, Republicans have criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation's search of Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, calling it an unnecessary escalation and weaponization of law enforcement against the Biden administration's opponents.</p><p>Mr. Biden has avoided the Mar-a-Lago search, and has declined to weigh in on the investigation into how the former president handled classified documents.</p><p>Alex Leary contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com</p><p>Biden to Say in Prime-Time Address Democracy Is at Stake in Midterm Elections</p>",
