  "text": "<p>   The Democratic House majority this week put on a bold demonstration of its newest governing strategy -- one it continues to perfect. Call it the \"Just Asking\" tactic. </p><p>   The exhibit took place at Wednesday's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on \"disinformation and extremism in the media.\" While lawmakers have spent years fretting over \"disinformation\" on social media, this was the first time they used a hearing to accuse news outlets of deliberately fomenting it. </p><p>   The precursor to the hearing was a revealing letter sent Monday by two California Democrats, Reps. Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney. The duo demanded the CEOs of a dozen cable, satellite and broadband providers explain what \"response\" they intended to take to the \"right-wing media ecosystem\" that is spreading \"lies\" and \"disinformation\" that enable \"insurrection\" and provokes \"non-compliance with public health guidelines.\" Specifically they asked each CEO: \"Are you planning to continue carrying Fox News, Newsmax and OANN . . . ? If so, why?\" </p><p>   Just asking. </p><p>   When Republican members of the committee and outside groups shouted censorship, Ms. Eshoo shrugged. \"The First Amendment, my friends, starts with four words: Congress shall make no laws,\" and she, Anna Eshoo, had no intention of enacting a law to shut down conservatives. She was merely asking \"strong, important questions\" -- i.e., whether private regulated companies understand that (if they know what's good for them) they'll do the dirty work for her, thereby saving her the hassle of complying with the Constitution. She was just asking. </p><p>   And why wouldn't she? It's been working so well for Democrats in other areas. Left-wing activists and politicians spent four years \"just asking\" social media companies what they intended to do about \"disinformation\" -- today's code word for conservative ideas. An emboldened left-leaning Silicon Valley is now happily doing Democrats' bidding, censoring like mad. Twitter, Facebook and others are banning prominent conservatives from their platforms. Twitter locked the account of a newspaper (the New York Post) for the sin of accurately reporting unflattering news about the Democratic presidential nominee's son. Google and Apple dropped Parler from their app stores. Amazon this week jumped into the virtual book-burning business, purging \"When Harry Became Sally\" by Ryan T. Anderson, a three-year-old book that addresses tough questions about gender identity. </p><p>   \"Right now, the greatest threat to free speech in this country is not any law passed by the government -- the First Amendment stands as a bulwark,\" says Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr. \"The threat comes in the form of legislating by letterhead. Politicians have realized that they can silence the speech of those with different political viewpoints by public bullying.\" </p><p>   What was new this week was Democrats' brazenness: their shocking and open targeting of news organizations. The left has long worked to shut down speech with which it disagrees, but officials in the past did it with more subterfuge. It came via legislation for \"campaign finance reform,\" or via their successful effort to push the IRS to target conservative nonprofits; or via Sen. Dick Durbin's campaign to pressure companies out of funding free-market nonprofits. Liberal activists have honed intimidation campaigns, threatening boycotts and other actions against companies that advertise on disfavored platforms or donate to right-leaning groups. </p><p>   Congress's engagement this week is an acknowledgment of the limits of that activist effort. As Angelo Carusone, president of the left-wing outfit Media Matters keeps noting, activists have discovered that their campaign against Fox's advertisers isn't enough, since Fox gets much of its revenue from subscription fees. So the only way to kill it off is to bully cable companies into dropping the network. Activists began a grassroots effort to do that last year but haven't made headway. Enter Ms. Eshoo and Mr. McNerney. (Disclosure: Fox's and the Journal's parent companies share common ownership, and I am a Fox News contributor.) </p><p>   Democrats may have a harder time bending these providers to their demands than they did Big Tech. Carriage decisions are governed by contract law; disappearing a cable channel isn't as easy as disappearing a Twitter account. And customers would likely revolt, with financial implications for providers. </p><p>   There's also growing political risk from the other side. The GOP finally understands what is happening and is beginning to counter it. Gov. Rick DeSantis's vow to protect Florida's citizens from Big Tech overreach is a shot across the censors' bows. There's also this week's letter to cable providers from West Virginia's Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey urging them to think \"very carefully\" about how they respond to Democratic pressure, given any wide deplatforming of conservative channels could very easily raise questions of \"collusive, coordinated and anticompetitive behavior.\" </p><p>   But don't doubt that Democrats will escalate their overt demands that companies act as their political enforcers, outsourcing the censorship the Constitution forbids. And don't buy the excuse that this is \"oversight.\" As law professor Jonathan Turley told Ms. Eshoo at the hearing: \"Making a statement and putting a question mark at the end of it doesn't change the import of the statement.\" This isn't just asking. It's an order. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Write to kim@wsj.com </p><p></p>",
