  "text": "<p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 rose127 points, or 0.4%, to 34,881.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 0.4%, or 16.85 points, to 4,476.25.</p><p>Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00 rose 53.25 points, or 0.3%, to 15,483.25.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow DJIA jumped 262 points, or 0.8%, to end at 34869, ending a five-session losing run. The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 10 points, or 0.2%, to 4468, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP slipped 10 points, or 0.1%, to 15105.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3% in August, while the core reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up just 0.1%.</p><p>The CPI increased 5.3% in the August year, compared to expectations for a 5.4% increase, and a rise of 5.5% for the year last month. The year-over-year change in core CPI fell back to 4% from 4.3% in July.</p><p>While the reading remains elevated, signs of peak inflation could make it less urgent for the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back its bond purchases, though investors have largely scaled back expectations for the central bank to lay out a timetable to begin tapering at its meeting next week.</p><p>Earlier, the National Federation of Independent Business said its small-business optimism index rose 0.4 point in August to 100.1. Small-business owners were somewhat more optimistic about the economy, but said record shortages of labor and supplies were cutting into sales and profits.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Apple Inc.AAPL will be in the spotlight as the megacap tech star launches its latest iPhones at an event due to start at 1 p.m. Eastern.
