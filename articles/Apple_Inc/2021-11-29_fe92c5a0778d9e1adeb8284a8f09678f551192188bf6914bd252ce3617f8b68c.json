  "title": "Stocks Close Higher as Investors Shrug Off Omicron Worries; Oil stabilizes, Moderna jumps as vaccine maker says it is working on booster for new variant",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.9% on Monday, boosted by investor appetite for technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 236 points, or 0.7%.</p><p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, rose 1% to settle at $73.44 a barrel. They tumbled more than 10% Friday, in their largest one-day percentage decline since April 2020.</p><p>\"Friday was a panic selloff,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. \"Traders have had time to sit back and breathe a bit,\" she added, noting that trading volumes were lower over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, likely exacerbating declines.</p><p>Investors are awaiting more clarity on the transmissibility and severity of the Omicron variant and data on how well it can be contained by existing vaccines. Renewed travel bans and coronavirus restrictions could threaten the global recovery. In some of the tougher moves so far, Israel has banned foreigners from entry and Japan has said it would close its borders to foreign visitors until more information about the new variant is available.</p><p>President Biden said Monday that Omicron was \"not a cause for panic.\" The administration is working with drug companies to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters in case they are needed to fight the new variant, he said. Some analysts expect the economic impact of Omicron to be limited as vaccine manufacturers update their shots to combat it.</p><p>\"There's less likelihood we see sustained downside from something like a variant because our ability to adapt to it is higher than it was,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"The ability to tailor vaccines makes a huge difference.\"</p><p>Moderna shares shot up 11.8%. The biotech company's stock surged more than 20% Friday after Moderna said it was working to rapidly advance an Omicron-specific booster candidate. U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech, which produces a Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer, added 4.2% Monday.</p><p>Some travel and leisure stocks rebounded after steep losses on Friday. Royal Caribbean Group added 2.8%, while rival cruise operator Carnival rose 0.8%. But Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group both fell around 1.2%, after swinging between gains and losses.</p><p>Technology was the best-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500. Microsoft rose 2.1%, while Apple added 2.2%.</p><p>Shares of Twitter fell 2.7% after the social-media company said Jack Dorsey was stepping down as CEO, effective immediately, and being replaced by Parag Agrawal, who was previously Twitter's chief technology officer.</p><p>Bitcoin rebounded after the largest cryptocurrency was pummeled by Friday's selloff. The dollar value of bitcoin rose 3% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to about $58,000. Its gains boosted cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, whose shares rose 5.3%.</p><p>Investors sold U.S. government bonds, which are viewed as safe assets to hold, pushing up yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.521% from 1.484% Friday.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%.</p><p>Major stock indexes in Asia fell. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.6% to its lowest closing level in a month and a half. The benchmark declined 2.5% Friday.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and South Korea's Kospi each fell around 1%, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 0.5% after the country tightened border controls over the weekend.</p><p>â€”Rebecca Feng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Frances Yoon at frances.yoon@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Higher as Investors Shrug Off Omicron Worries</p>",
