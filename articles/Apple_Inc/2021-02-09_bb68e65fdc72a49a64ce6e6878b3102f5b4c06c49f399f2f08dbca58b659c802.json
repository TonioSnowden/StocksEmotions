  "text": "<p>Tom Braithwaite's astute article (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efbe2bc3-bafb-4291-b045-e797c31fb3bc\">The Top Line</a>, FT Weekend, February 6) poses the conundrum of why so many successful public boards ignore the need for independent chairs. Having served on many private boards (three as chairperson), these work well because they are composed of parties who are fully invested in the long-term success of the company — founders, management, angel investors and venture capitalists. </p> <p>The members of private boards understand (mostly) the concomitant business risks and rewards and think long-term, in years not quarters. They also appreciate the need to be agile. </p> <p>When companies go public, accountability becomes diffused — independent board members and chairs with little stake in the company become proxies for others. </p> <p>Public boards become more worried about regulatory risk than business risk. It's not so surprising that the vast majority of leading public companies are innovators (Apple, Facebook and Google etc) and have dispensed with the need for independent chairs. </p> <p><strong>Aron Miodownik <br></strong><em>Cambrian Consulting, New York, NY, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Independent chairs work well in private companies' FT.com 9 February.
