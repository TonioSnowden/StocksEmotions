  "title": "Elon Musk Contends Censorship, Not Abuse, Is Twitter's Problem; Billionaire says he doesn't care about making money from the business but cares about freedom",
  "text": "<p>In offering to buy Twitter for $43 billion, the world's richest man says he is intent on transforming the company into a bastion for free speech. By taking it private, he says, he would remove the persistent pressure on the company from advertisers and shareholders about content that is potentially offensive to some users or could be deemed abusive.</p><p>\"Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,\" Mr. Musk said in a federal filing Thursday.</p><p>The moderation-light philosophy flies in the face of the company's growth strategy in recent years, which dates back to 2016—when big suitors last circled in a public fashion.</p><p>At that time, both Salesforce.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co. seriously considered offers and their executives later told reporters the trolling and abuse that was prevalent on the platform turned them off. Women and minorities have often been subjected to abuse and harassment, in particular, analysts and Twitter executives have said.</p><p>\"The nastiness is extraordinary\" on Twitter, former Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger told the New York Times in 2019. \"Like a lot of these platforms, they have the ability to do a lot of good in our world. They also have an ability to do a lot of bad. I didn't want to take that on.\"</p><p>Photos: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter</p><p>The Tesla CEO was a millionaire in his 20s and has parlayed each business success into new endeavors</p><p>Mr. Musk does want to take that on. Over the past two weeks, he has argued in a blizzard of tweets and again Thursday in his securities filing that censorship—not abuse—is the company's core problem.</p><p>Mr. Musk, who has been accused of harassment himself for the way he attacks his critics on Twitter, said efforts to minimize harm often undermine the expression of unpopular ideas.</p><p>\"If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,\" Mr. Musk said Thursday during an interview at a TED conference in Vancouver. \"If it's a gray area, I would say let the tweet exist.\"</p><p>Executives including Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg have repeatedly said their position is the same—to err on the side of leaving content alone. The challenge is defining both the gray areas and the red lines that can't be crossed.</p><p>Among his ideas for how to improve Twitter, Mr. Musk said, is that the social network's algorithm should be open-sourced, meaning that its code could be available for study by outsiders. He also said any efforts to amplify or limit the reach of users' tweets should be publicly documented.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What would Twitter look like under Elon Musk's ownership? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"That action should be made apparent so anyone can see that action has been taken so there's no sort of behind the scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually,\" Mr. Musk said.</p><p>And Mr. Musk made clear he doesn't think anything goes is the best approach either: He said he would like to crack down on scams and spam posts that populate his Twitter feed.</p><p>A Twitter spokesman declined to comment. The company on Thursday released a statement saying it was considering Mr. Musk's offer.</p><p>Mr. Musk's views drew support from many who believe tech companies have become too heavy-handed with their content moderation, a view commonly articulated by conservatives and free-speech advocates.</p><p>Startup founder and cryptocurrency investor Cameron Winklevoss tweeted that any attempt by Twitter to thwart Mr. Musk's offer \"shows you how deeply committed they are to Orwellian control of the narratives and global discourse.\" Mr. Winklevoss's twin brother, Tyler, tweeted there is no \"rational or moral argument against\" Twitter being the platform for free speech around the globe.</p><p>Clamping down on what the company classified as harassment and hate speech was a major part of the its efforts throughout former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's tenure, as those problems were seen to be driving away users. Mr. Musk's call to expand free speech on the service threatens to undo that work, said Scott Kessler, vice president and global lead for technology at Third Bridge, a research firm.</p><p>\"Sometimes when people are idealistic or aspirational, they don't think about the other side of those considerations,\" Mr. Kessler said. Reducing harassment is \"something that the company's spent a lot of time and money on over the last couple of years, and I think by many accounts, they've done a pretty good job.\"</p><p>External researchers who study online harms said a potential Musk takeover of Twitter could mean less investment in building tools that allow users to report and block content they see as harmful.</p><p>Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard Kennedy's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, said reducing the harm caused by online campaigns targeting minorities and other vulnerable groups needs \"to be a priority in the C-suite. Musk does not seem to be concerned with that.\"</p><p>Twitter relies on advertising for nearly 90% of its total revenue and Mr. Musk seems OK with losing some business if that is the impact of the company changing its policies. He said he doesn't care about making money from Twitter.</p><p>\"Clearly he's trying to drive a platform that has less moderation to it, and a platform like that maybe intrigues advertisers a lot less,\" said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.</p><p>In interviews, some Twitter employees expressed concerns that Mr. Musk's approach would distract and destabilize teams focused on fighting toxic content. Some employees said they were dismayed by what they consider Mr. Musk's primitive grasp of the complexities of content moderation.</p><p>Mr. Musk isn't the first entrepreneur to call for more freedom of speech on social media. In the recent past, upstart social networks including Parler and Gab have promised to offer users fewer limits on speech than what they can find on Twitter, Meta's Facebook and more established social networks. Those newer services have run into a number of problems.</p><p>Gab was knocked offline when the company's service providers refused to continue supporting the social network after it was discovered that it had been used by the alleged 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooter. Gab was unable to restore its service until it pledged to proactively police its service for threats of violence.</p><p>Similarly, Parler was forced into digital exile by its service providers in 2021 following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol following reports that the social network was hosting inappropriate content. Parler wasn't allowed back into Apple Inc.'s App Store until it committed to improved moderation policies.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com and Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com</p><p>Elon Musk Contends Censorship, Not Abuse, Is Twitter's Problem</p>",
