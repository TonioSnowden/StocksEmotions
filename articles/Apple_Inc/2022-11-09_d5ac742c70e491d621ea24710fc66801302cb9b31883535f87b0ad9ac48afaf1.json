  "text": "<p>Volatility in Apple supplier stocks is soaring. First it was Taiwanese iPhone maker Foxconn. Now it is Chinese AirPods maker Goertek. Shares in the Chinese component maker&#xa0;fell by their daily limit of 10 per cent after the company said it had suspended production of an audio product from a “major overseas” client. </p> <p>The hit to sales would be less than a tenth of last year's total. The severe market reaction highlights the fragility of a business model heavily dependent on a handful of large customers. Geopolitics and China's zero-Covid policy are adding to that risk.</p> <p>Goertek, which is one of the largest acoustic components companies in China, did not name the client or the product involved. It warned that the suspension could cost as much as Rmb3.3bn ($456mn) of revenue this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the same day, shares of local rival AAC Technologies rose 15 per cent in Hong Kong, bringing gains to 40 per cent in the past month. The stock of another rival Luxshare Precision Industry is up 15 per cent, sparking speculation that Apple may have switched AirPod orders to these two large Apple suppliers.</p> <p>The broader picture for Apple and its suppliers is bleak. Global demand for smartphones and electronics is weakening this year. Lockdowns of the main iPhone production facility in China have caused damaging disruption. Operating costs are rising. </p> <p>That shakes the foundation of the business model of Chinese assembly and contract manufacturers which are run on razor-thin margins.</p> <p>Goertek's contract with Apple four years ago made it the second-largest maker of AirPods in the world. Despite the sales boost, operating margins have continued their steep slide over the past decade from over 16 per cent to just 4.6 per cent in the year to September. Those have followed nearly an identical trajectory to peer Luxshare which also runs on margins of 4.6 per cent. </p> <p>Gambling on Apple supplier stocks has paid off handsomely in the past decade, gains on Luxshare of more than 2000 per cent have shown. Risks are now weighted on the downside.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Goertek/Apple: single-client risk amplifies AirPod contract doubts' FT.com 9 November.
