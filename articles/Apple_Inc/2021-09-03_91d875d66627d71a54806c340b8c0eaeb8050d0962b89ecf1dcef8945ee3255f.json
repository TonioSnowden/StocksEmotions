  "text": "<p>Zoom Video Communications Inc.</p><p>Will Zoom meetings survive the end of the pandemic? The company on Monday surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, but demand for its videoconferencing services is showing signs of slowing. Zoom said that small businesses and consumers were starting to spend less as opportunities for in-person meetings and gatherings expand, and some metrics supercharged by the pandemic had begun to normalize. As offices start to reopen, analysts are raising questions about Zoom's ability to retain paying customers and sustain the growth rate it enjoyed during the pandemic's work-from-home boom. Zoom shares fell 17% Tuesday.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</p><p>Americans are buying up toilet paper again. Procter &amp; Gamble, the biggest U.S. manufacturer of toilet paper and paper towels, said it is increasing production as demand rises. The maker of Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels is speeding up production lines, running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week and investing to boost shipping volumes. While the situation isn't as dire as it was in early 2020 when panicked shoppers cleared shelves of paper towels and toilet paper, for many months sales had returned to pre-pandemic levels as Americans worked through their stockpiles. P&amp;G shares fell 0.4% Tuesday.</p><p>Alphabet Inc.</p><p>Google is hitting refresh on its return-to-work schedule. The Alphabet unit said on Tuesday that it is pushing back its voluntary return plans for corporate staff, extending work-from-home policies until Jan. 10 amid rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations. Google will also give staff holidays on Oct. 22 and Dec. 17 this year to \"reset and recharge.\" The delay comes a month after Google pushed its return to offices to October from September because of the highly infectious Delta variant. Earlier this month, its Silicon Valley peer, Apple Inc., delayed its back-to-work plans for staff until at least January. Alphabet shares ended 0.1% lower Tuesday.</p><p>Mondelez International Inc.</p><p>Grocers are having a snack attack. Stores worried about a run on Ritz crackers and Oreos are boosting their orders in case the maker of these snacks, Mondelez, curbs production due to a labor strike that is now in its fourth week. Mondelez workers are opposing changes to work schedules, overtime and healthcare that the company has sought in contract negotiations. Unionized workers kicked off the strike on Aug. 10 at a Mondelez bakery in Portland, Ore., and the action has since spread to two other bakeries and three distribution facilities in Colorado, Illinois, Georgia and Virginia. Mondelez shares declined 0.7% Thursday.</p><p>Moderna Inc.</p><p>How low should a dose of Covid-19 booster shot go? That is the question before the Food and Drug Administration as it weighs a Moderna request to authorize a booster at 50 micrograms, half the dosage given in the first two shots. But The Wall Street Journal reported that some in the government favor a higher booster dose on hopes that it would assure stronger protection against Covid-19 variants. People who have seen the data told the Journal both doses produce strong immune responses. One possible benefit of a lower dose is fewer side effects. Moderna shares rose 2% Thursday.</p><p>Ford Motor Co.</p><p>The auto industry is hitting the brakes on Labor Day weekend car sales due to a computer-chip shortage. Dealership lots were stripped of inventory ahead of one of the biggest selling weekends of the year. The availability of new and used vehicles is down following a semiconductor shortfall that hampered auto production in the spring and summer. Both Ford and General Motors Co. said recently that they are extending production cuts at several North American factories into September because of a lack of chips, used in everything from air bags and engines to media displays. Ford shares closed down 0.9% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>United Airlines, Procter &amp; Gamble, Moderna: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
