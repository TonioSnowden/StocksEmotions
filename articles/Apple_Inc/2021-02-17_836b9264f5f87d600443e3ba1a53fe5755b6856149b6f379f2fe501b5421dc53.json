  "text": "<p>The Dow industrials rose 64.35 points, or 0.2%, to 31522.75, an eighth record close of 2021. The S&amp;P 500 edged down 2.24 points, or 0.1%, to 3932.59. The Nasdaq Composite fell 47.97 points, or 0.3%, to 14047.50, weighed down by losses in shares of heavily weighted Apple and Microsoft .</p><p>The economically sensitive energy and financial groups led the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, rising 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively.</p><p>Investors in recent days have been heartened by expectations that a fresh round of stimulus spending and continued support from the Federal Reserve will support economic recovery. House Democrats are preparing to stitch together a legislative version of President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal.</p><p>Sentiment also has been buoyed by the rollout of vaccines and a drop in Covid-19 infection rates in many countries.</p><p>\"The fiscal stimulus package is looking like it will be on the larger side,\" said Seema Shah , chief strategist at Principal Global Advisors. \"The backdrop, if anything, has really improved. It has just firmed up what everyone was expecting.\"</p><p>A better-than-expected corporate earnings season also has supported the rally. With about three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported, roughly 80% have beaten profit estimates, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"All the earnings being reported are generally a lot higher than most estimates,\" said Charles Hepworth, an investment director at GAM Investments.</p><p>Strong earnings and the start of the vaccine rollout have led investors to become more optimistic on the hardest-hit sectors of the pandemic, he said. \"We're still stuck in this K-shaped recovery, where you have certain areas of the market doing well and others getting hammered, and now the market is starting to think everything is going to come back,\" Mr. Hepworth said.</p><p>Still, investors note risks to the outlook, including the possibility of problems with vaccine rollout and relatively pricey valuations for stocks. The S&amp;P 500 traded Friday at 22.52 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, above a five-year average of 17.96.</p><p>\"You look at prices and you are seeing those valuations reflective of the prevailing optimism,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"So if you do see some negative developments, I think the market could be susceptible to a bit of a pullback and a bit more volatility.\"</p><p>Among individual stocks, shares of Palantir Technologies fell $4.07, or 13%, to $27.84 after the data-mining company reported a surprise loss for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Frigid temperatures across swaths of the U.S. have injected new momentum into the rally in energy markets. Natural-gas prices rose 7.5% to their highest level since early November. Since natural gas is burned to generate electricity and heat, its price tends to rise during cold snaps. Analysts said production is also likely to be curtailed by the conditions.</p><p>\"This Arctic breeze is clearly increasing the demand for oil and heating in general. That clearly is something to watch,\" said Carsten Brzeski , ING Groep 's global head of macro research.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.298% from 1.199% Friday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Bitcoin topped $50,000 for the first time Tuesday, doubling in value in less than two months.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked down 0.1%. In Asia, exchanges in mainland China were closed Tuesday for the Lunar New Year holiday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.9% on the first day of trading after the holiday period, with energy and banking stocks leading gains.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.3% by the close of trading. Shares of Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group surged 4.1% to 10,420 yen, equivalent to more than $98.</p><p>Early Wednesday, the Nikkei was down 0.9%, the Hang Seng was up 0.2% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.2%. U.S. stock futures were flat.</p><p>---</p><p>Chong Koh Ping contributed to this article.</p>",
