The final 57-43 vote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eba8bca-b0a0-4f0b-971a-ca100336d26d\">revealed a crisis</a> within the Republican party over how to respond to their recent election losses. </p> <p>After voting to acquit Trump, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell hinted that the former president's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/225e04cb-851f-4594-8d85-8968282d48ec\">legal woes were far from over</a>. He echoed suggestions that Trump could face charges in criminal or civil courts relating to the January 6 siege.</p> <p>“We have a criminal justice system in this country,” said the Senate minority leader on Saturday night. “We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”</p> <p>The US has not purged Trump from its public life, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab63151c-62bf-45f2-9122-8a48f86a4357\">writes our editorial board</a>.
