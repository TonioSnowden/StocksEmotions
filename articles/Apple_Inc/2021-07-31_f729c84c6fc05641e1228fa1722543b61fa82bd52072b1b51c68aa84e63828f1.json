The company has said it spends money to ensure that the store provides a safe, secure way for users to download apps.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is expected to make a ruling on the dispute in the coming months.</p><p>Mr. Musk routinely takes aim at rivals and critics on Twitter.</p>",
