  "text": "<p>Foldable phones are so last year. Soon you will be able to roll your handset up. The rollable display is the next step in the evolution of screens for devices ranging from phones to televisions. An exciting year for display makers lies ahead.</p> <p>Folding phones were seen as a marketing gimmick with little chance at adding to the bottom line not so long ago. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfdff536-fae7-40f0-8bbc-ca01420a59bd\">Samsung has proved</a> them wrong, selling about 3m foldable phones — priced at more than $2,000 — in 2020. That is six times more than its own and analysts' estimates. Folding phones have boosted average sales prices for Samsung phones and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6da69954-5eac-4ecb-b056-73d131fe0cb4\">group margins</a>.</p> <p>Rollables will accelerate growth in the flexible displays market, predicted to reach $32bn in five years. LG Electronics has unveiled a rollable phone expected to hit markets in March. When extended, the phone turns into a tablet. Samsung's rollable phone can be pulled out at both sides, increasing the size of the screen. When it is stretched, it is an eight-inch tablet, the size of an iPad Mini.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9bcacc8-130d-11e9-a581-4ff78404524e\">Rollables</a> have more than just first adopter chic to recommend them. Unlike foldable displays, which were mostly limited to phones, they can be used for PCs, TVs and more. Fat margins on flexible display phones soothe concerns that they may cannibalise Samsung tablet sales, which nearly doubled to 9m in the third quarter.</p> <p>Even without the added boost of these high-margin devices, display makers have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic. Remote working and learning have boosted demand for displays and high-end TVs. Even LCD displays, a sector once seen to be in terminal decline, have recorded a consistent increase in panel prices. </p> <p>Shares of LG Display have more than doubled from a March low, as shipments increased by a quarter in the third quarter. Those of Samsung, which has its own display unit, are up 90 per cent.</p> <p>Tech fans tempted to buy the first rollable phones may want to wait a few months. Many will recall the problems associated with Samsung's first-generation foldable phones. Getting rollables right may take time too. But buyers interested in shares of display makers should act early.</p> <p><em>This is one of four Lex notes highlighting New Year investment possibilities.</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Display tech: the rolling phones' FT.com 1 January.
