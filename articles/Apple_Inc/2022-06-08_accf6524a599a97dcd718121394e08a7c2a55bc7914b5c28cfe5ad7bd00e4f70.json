  "text": "<p>While the U.S., a core market for TSMC, has been grappling with inflation trending at above 8% in recent months, TSMC's chairman downplayed its impact on the sector. For TSMC, strong demand for electric vehicle-related products and high-performance computers is likely to keep its plants fully occupied through this year, even as appetite weakens for consumer electronics like smartphones and personal computers, Chairman Mark Liu said.</p><p>TSMC counts iPhone maker Apple Inc. and sensor producer Sony Group Corp. among its customers. In the high-performance computing sector, which processes data and calculations at high speeds, TSMC-made chips are used in central processing units, graphics units and autonomous driving vehicles.</p><p>Shipments for the global smartphone market fell 7% from a year earlier in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint, a research firm. The recent decline in China was particularly steepâ€”shipments fell 34% in April from a year earlier, according to state-backed data. The Covid-19 pandemic's resurgence in the country in recent months has dented consumer spending and strained its supply chain.</p><p>Chips using advanced or specialized technologies are the major drivers of TSMC's growth, Chief Executive C.C. Wei said.</p><p>Hsinchu-based TSMC also said it would continue to spend big on building new plants and developing advanced chips, capitalizing on the global chip shortage. It plans for more than $40 billion in capital expenditures next year, executives said, compared with the $40 billion to $44 billion it expects to spend this year. TSMC is currently building new chip plants in Arizona and in Kumamoto, Japan.</p><p>The cost of building the $12 billion plant in Arizona is greater than TSMC estimated earlier, Mr. Liu said, citing a time-consuming process for the Congressional approval of a $52 billion chip-funding bill, parts of which are supposed to back the Arizona project. The company can still afford the cost, Mr. Liu said, without elaborating.</p><p>Beyond Arizona and Japan, TSMC is looking to expand in various regions, Mr. Liu said, adding that the company has no detailed plans to disclose at the moment. TSMC is considering building a multibillion-dollar chip plant in Singapore, The Wall Street Journal reported previously.</p><p>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</p><p>TSMC Sticks to Sales Growth Outlook Despite Economic Woes, Inflation</p>",
