  "text": "<p>\n  The Drake Passage -- the stretch of ocean between Cape Horn and Antarctica -- is sometimes glassy and calm. But more often, it's a choppy ride with at least 20-foot waves that will rock even the most stable of ships -- and turn the strongest of stomachs. To skip all that, try Silversea's Antarctica Bridge trip, which ranges from five to nine days. The fare includes round-trip flights from your hometown to Santiago, Chile; round-trip charter flights from Santiago to Punta Arenas, on the country's southern tip; and round-trip charter flights to Antarctica's King George Island where you'll meet a luxury boat. Audley Travel's Matt Nilsson said Silversea is the most popular option for their high-end clients. From $16,600 a person </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  FOR SUPER LUXURY SEEKERS </p><p>\n  The Scenic Eclipse is about as luxe as you can get while cruising around Antarctica. \"That's definitely a five-star vessel,\" said Mr. Palmer of the ship, which can carry 288 guests but has a cap of 200 in polar regions. The ship offers eight restaurants, a spa and spacious staterooms (the smallest is 345 square feet), and the company's all-inclusive 16-day Beyond the Antarctic Circle itinerary is among the only Antarctic cruises that hit that extreme southern latitude. But don't expect to laze on board all day getting pampered. Available excursions include submarine rides, helicopter tours, paddleboarding, shore landings and, starting next season, heli-skiing. From $19,525 a person </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  FOR NATURE NERDS </p><p>\n  Most cruises have experts to guide you, but thanks to its partnership with National Geographic, Lindblad's cruises host scientists doing their own research in Antarctica, as well as Nat Geo photographers who will give you pointers whether you're shooting with a pro camera or an iPhone. Guests can attend experts' lectures, accompany them on landings and, when Covid restrictions lift, join them for meals. \"Lindblad has always done a great job with . . . naturalists and lecturers. They're probably the leader in that area,\" said Mr. Palmer. The 14-day Journey to Antarctica itinerary offers a polar plunge, kayaking and hiking.

Some companies even offer items like waterproof pants and gloves for rent onboard. But, being a fashion editor, I tend to gravitate toward clothes with a little something extra. While the standard-issue suggestions are all fine and functional -- which should be your top concern -- they're not exactly chic. So I made a few adjustments: I opted for my favorite cat-eye sunglasses over ski goggles; shapely waterproof salopettes instead of unflattering nylon pants; and a mohawk-topped hat in lieu of a standard beanie. One thing I don't advise tweaking? The boots. Your ship should have pairs to borrow or rent, which will be cleaned with biocide daily to kill living organisms so you don't trek anything foreign onto shore during your various landings. Plus, they need to be warm and waterproof, so don't try anything fancy.
