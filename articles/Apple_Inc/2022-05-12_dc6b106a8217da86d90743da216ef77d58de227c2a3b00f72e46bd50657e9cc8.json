  "text": "<p>Taiwan's Foxconn, also known as Hon Tai Technology Group TW:2354, and Lordstown Motors Corp. RIDE late Wednesday announced that the sale of Lordstown Motors's plant to the electronics contract maker had closed.</p><p>The companies also signed a contract manufacturing agreement and announced an EV joint venture. Foxconn is better known as the maker of Apple Inc.'s AAPL iPhone, in addition of several other marquee-name electronics, and its deal with Lordstown Motors gives it an entry into the EV market.</p><p>Shares of Lordstown Motors rallied more than 30% after the announcements, and are up another 35% on Thursday. The company had been dogged by concerns it could have run out of money if the sale had fallen through.</p><p>Fisker, whose business model is to bring in house design and consumer-facing components but leave the manufacturing to contractors, has inked deals with Foxconn as well as Magna International Inc. CA:MG to build its EVs.</p><p>The Irvine, Calif., company described the Pear as \"a revolutionary electric vehicle that won't fit into any existing segment.\"</p><p>It plans on using new lighting technology and \"a wraparound front windscreen inspired by a glider plane glass canopy, enhancing frontal vision,\" Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker said in a statement. Fisker said he will visit the Lordstown factory with a team of engineers on Friday.</p><p>Fisker, which became public in 2020 through a merger with a blank-check company, hopes to start production of the Fisker Ocean, the luxury SUV that would be its first EV, in Austria in November.</p><p>Fisker said in March that reservations for the Ocean continued \"at an elevated pace\" and had totaled more than 45,000 preorders, including 1,600 fleet reservations.</p><p>Fisker, Foxconn confirm build of compact EV in Lordstown plant</p>",
