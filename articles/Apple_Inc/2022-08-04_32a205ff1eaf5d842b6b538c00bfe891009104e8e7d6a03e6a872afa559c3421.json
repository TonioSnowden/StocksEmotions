  "text": "<p>Little wonder there was sufficient bi-partisan support in Washington last month to pass the Chips and Science Act, designed to boost U.S semiconductor production.</p><p>And even setting geopolitical problems aside, the sector faces headwinds reckons Wells Fargo analyst Amit Chanda.</p><p>\"As the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raises interest rates to combat inflation, eventually leading to decelerating economic growth, we believe risks have increased for demand weakness to spread from low-end consumer personal computers and low-end smartphones to other semiconductor end markets within the technology economy at some point later this year or early next year,\" says Chanda in a note.</p><p>Granted demand currently is fairly robust in pockets, notably within the cloud computing and data centre sectors. But Chanda believes relatively high levels of inventory, combined with slower semiconductor sales growth as economic activity weakens, increase the risk of an \"inventory-led correction for the semiconductor industry\".</p><p>Evidence of this came recently, he notes, when the largest semiconductor foundry in Taiwan forecast that an inventory correction cycle would occur from the second half of 2022 through the first half of 2023.</p><p>The market has clearly anticipated some of these issues. The PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX was trading at 26 times its next twelve months (NTM) earnings forecasts at the start of the year. Having fallen 22.6 % so far in 2022, the multiple is now down to about 16 NTM earnings.</p><p>But Chanda warns that until the downturn is properly reflected in profit forecasts investors will remain wary.</p><p>\"Despite the contraction in multiples, most institutional investors continue to expect sell-side analysts to reduce consensus earnings-per-share estimates in the 15%-20% range before they feel comfortable revisiting semiconductor equities\"</p><p>Markets</p><p>A cautious tone for markets sees S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 up just 0.1% to 4,159 and Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 adding 0.1% to 13,278.
