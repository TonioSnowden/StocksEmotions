  "text": "<p>Who bears responsibility for Kanye West, aka Ye? Well, West of course: it is his decision to rebrand himself as the world's most prominent anti-Semite and Hitler apologist. But there are other dynamics too. One is his bipolar disorder. Another is the US's tilt towards the far right. A third is the race hatred etched with acid into its society. And so on; the blame spills outwards. Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for Ye.</p> <p>In this volatile collision of forces, the role played by arts criticism might seem trivial. But it must face up to its failings as well. The extravagant acclaim that has been heaped on West is a contributory factor in his embrace of violent extremism. It has fostered a dangerous idea of exceptionalism in him, the belief that he is a brilliant avant-garde figure unbound by convention. “Is Kanye West hip-hop's greatest cubist?” asked The Guardian newspaper in 2016 when he released his scrappy, Picasso-referencing album <em>The Life of Pablo</em>. That was when he described himself as the world's “greatest living artist”. As much puffery as self-puffery has gone into inflating his self-regard.</p> <p>A crucial term here is “genius”. West has claimed this loaded word for himself on multiple occasions. “I'm totally weird and I'm totally honest and I'm totally inappropriate sometimes, and the thing is, for me to say I wasn't a genius, I would just be lying to you and myself,” he told US television chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2013. This year's Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f21c8b1d-3f3f-4f92-be67-4af448b6270e\"><em>Jeen-Yuhs</em></a> showed him adopting it as early as 2002, two years before the release of his debut album. “Who are you to call yourself a genius?” his fellow Chicago rapper Rhymefest asks him in footage from this early point in his career. West smiles at the camera and says nothing in response. </p> <p>“Genius” has a particular significance in African-American music. <em>Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius</em> was the name of a 1963 live album by Motown's prodigy, Stevie Wonder. Four years earlier, <em>The Genius of Ray Charles</em> was released by another blind maestro. The term belongs among the many honorifics in black American pop, from Bessie Smith's “Empress of the Blues” to the superlative boasts of hip-hop culture. All that is partly showbiz glitz, yes — but it is also an assertion of high status in a nation built on the degradations of racism.</p> <p>In that context, who can cavil with such exceptionally resourceful and imaginative black musicians as Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder being called geniuses? An anti-racist resonance is clear in West's own use of the word, too. Asked why he called himself a genius in 2015, he replied: “All of my aspirations are things that currently only 60-year-old white people do.” In “Power”, a key song from his best album, 2010's <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, he encapsulated a mixed process of individual black giftedness and collective black ennoblement when he rapped: “In this white man world, we the ones chosen.”</p> <p>But West does not just lay claim to the symbolic use of “genius”. He means it literally about himself. Commentators have responded by taking it literally too, as when The Atlantic magazine lauded him in 2012 as “the first true genius of the iPhone era, the Mozart of contemporary American music”. The term was still being deployed when <em>Jeen-Yuhs</em> arrived in January. By now, following West's immersion in Trumpian politics, it was qualified with notions of tragic downfall.</p> <p>West's uniqueness is held to reside in a kind of futurism or technological disruptiveness, hearing new sounds before anyone else. His 2008 album <em>808s and Heartbreak</em> did indeed break ground in hip-hop with its emotive melodies and computerised singing. But treating such innovations as acts of far-sighted genius has helped to pave a path to the present shocking juncture — that in which one of the biggest names in US popular culture has publicly announced “I like Hitler” and “I love Nazis”.</p> <p>The turning point was 2013's <em>Yeezus</em>, a discordant, messy album that was feverishly overpraised for its discordance and messiness. “Every mad genius has to make a record like this at least once in his career,” Rolling Stone magazine raved, in a turn of phrase that predated West's revelation of his bipolar diagnosis in 2018. It was no more tasteless than his own remarks about mental health and talent. “Name one genius who ain't crazy,” he rapped on <em>The Life of Pablo</em>.</p> <p>Psychological turmoil must have a bearing on his present dire situation. But it is an insufficient explanation for it. West's hateful pronouncements are also the awful culmination of his glorification as an out-there thinker.</p> <p>When he praised Adolf Hitler, he described the dictator as having “invented the very microphone that I use as a musician”. The claim was wrong — but not completely wrong. In 1928, the audio inventor Georg Neumann created the first commercially produced condenser microphone, more powerful than rival devices. Tall and bulbous, its use at Nazi rallies led to its being dubbed the “Hitlerflasche”, or Hitler bottle. It became the template for studio microphones used up to the present day.</p> <p>The twinning of technology and authoritarianism is the dark flipside to tech-utopian dreams of progress in liberal democracies. It is based on omnipotent fantasies of the vanguardist <em>Übermensch</em>, a higher being bending the world to his will. It is grotesque to find one of America's biggest stars casting himself in this mould, with its white-supremacist associations. But here is the poisonous sump where all the talk of Kanye West's genius has led.</p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2022 'Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Kanye — it tolls for Ye' FT.com 13 December.
