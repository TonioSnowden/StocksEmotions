  "title": "U.S. News:  Indiana Sues TikTok, Saying  It Aims Adult Content at Teens  ----  By Stu Woo, Erin Mulvaney and Ben Kesling",
  "text": "<p>   Indiana filed a pair of lawsuits against TikTok on Wednesday, alleging the platform is deceiving consumers about its content and data security, the latest in a growing series of moves by state officials to push back against the platform's influence on children and its connections to China. </p><p>   The state said its lawsuits were the first of their kind against the popular app and its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. In one of the complaints, Indiana alleges TikTok's algorithm is designed to addict young users and promotes harmful content that isn't appropriate for them. The suit cites studies and reports linking heavy use of the platform to mental disorders among teenagers, including eating disorders and depression. </p><p>   \"TikTok is actively exposing our children to drug use, alcohol abuse, profanity and sexually explicit material at a young age,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican. \"TikTok is deceiving Indiana parents.\" </p><p>   The second suit alleges China has the ability to use TikTok's data to spy on, blackmail and coerce users to serve the country's national security and economic interests. Both lawsuits seek changes to TikTok's practices, as well civil penalties for each alleged violation. </p><p>   Also Wednesday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned the use of TikTok on government-issued devices, citing concerns that the platform could assist China in the surveillance of Americans and other intelligence work. Other states have begun to make similar moves in recent weeks. </p><p>   TikTok declined to comment on the litigation but said \"the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority. We build youth well-being into our policies, limit features by age, empower parents with tools and resources, and continue to invest in new ways to enjoy content based on age-appropriateness or family comfort. We are also confident that we're on a path in our negotiations with the U.S. Government to fully satisfy all reasonable U.S. national security concerns.\" </p><p>   In regard to state bans, it said, \"we believe the concerns driving these decisions are largely fueled by misinformation about our company.\" </p><p>   Both Indiana lawsuits alleged TikTok is violating the state's consumer-protection laws by deceiving the public about its operations. In the complaint focused on children, the state alleged the app is misrepresenting that it is appropriate for users ages 12 and older. For example, to have a 12-plus rating on Apple's App Store, TikTok must represent that references to mature themes, alcohol, drugs and sexual content are \"infrequent/mild,\" according to the lawsuit. </p><p>   In fact, such material is abundantly available, from videos about hallucinogenic drugs and how to make alcohol taste like candy, to clips about strippers and sexual kinks, including bondage and rape fantasies, the state alleges. </p><p>   Last week, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, issued an executive order banning TikTok from state agencies over national security concerns. The state tourism department has since deleted its TikTok account, which had 60,000 followers. South Dakota's public broadcaster did the same. The state's six public universities are evaluating next steps later this week. </p><p>   South Dakota was the second state to take such action. Nebraska did so in 2020. </p><p>   On Monday, South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said he requested that the state's department of administration remove TikTok from government devices and block the site. The same day, lawmakers in Arkansas filed legislation for the coming 2023 session that would ban access to TikTok from state-owned or state-leased devices. </p><p>   Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, also a Republican, issued Tuesday what he called an emergency cybersecurity directive to prohibit the use of certain Chinese -- and Russian -- developed technology, including TikTok, in the state's executive branch. </p><p>   In South Dakota, the ban has sown confusion and some consternation. Some state employees say it is unclear if they can run state-affiliated TikTok accounts from personal devices. </p><p>   The order bans the use of TikTok on \"state-owned or state-leased equipment,\" specifically prohibiting the app from being downloaded on such devices. It is less clear if the ban includes being able to access TikTok on personal phones through internet providers used in public spaces such as state-funded universities. </p><p></p>",
