  "title": "Inside View: Maskless Among the Lemmings",
  "text": "<p>I counted 50 shoppers, 49 masked. Did these people not get the unmasking memo? I was the only one not wearing a mask, and I was loving it. California is operating on an honor system, and though I'm fully vaxxed, I wish I weren't. That very same day, Mr. Newsom was at Disneyland doling out $1.5 million prizes (taxpayer money) to 10 winners of a California vaccine lottery. That beats President Biden's \"Get a shot and have a beer.\" Lesson Learned: Next pandemic, I wait to get paid.</p><p>Maybe those 49 maskers haven't yet been vaccinated? The adage is: To find the next measles outbreak, find towns with Whole Foods supermarkets. Those places usually have high concentrations of antivaxers. That adage could probably apply to Trader Joe's, too.</p><p>But this vaccine is different. Statistics suggest red-staters are the ones declining the Covid-19 vaccines, not the usual dissidents inspired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I'd bet good money all 49 of my fellow shoppers are topped up with vaccine-induced antibodies. So who exactly are they protecting? Me? Thanks but no thanks.</p><p>As I made my way past the wild arugula and baby spinach -- the rabbit-food section -- I noticed many shoppers giving me the stink eye. But c'mon, it's not like I had 11 items in the express line. I don't think anyone was smiling at me under a mask, though I was beaming ear to ear. Freedom feels good.</p><p>What bizarro world had I entered? Mask mandates were over, and yet here I was in some weird anxiety zone for the masked who continue to feel they are in perpetual danger. It was as if I were sullying some sacred pure-living temple by breathing freely. Were these 49 shoppers simply Linuses unwilling to let go of their security blankets? Or were they more like robotic Stepford wives, preprogrammed and obedient? I will admit to mumbling \"sheep\" and \"lemmings\" and other things under my breath.</p><p>At checkout, my iPhone's Apple Pay worked for once, recognizing my maskless mug -- some needed normalcy. Since Trader Joe's Joe-Joe's, their fake Oreos, taste like old socks, I was off to Safeway for the real Double Stuf. Sure enough, I was the only unmasked person there, too. Buying Oreos takes me a while because I am always fascinated by the different flavors: Golden, Birthday Cake, Carrot Cake (really?). I've even heard of limited-edition \"cheerful vegan flavor\" Lady Gaga-inspired Oreos. More like gag-gag. I stare at the choices but always get mint, especially this year, since those enterprising Girl Scouts didn't come around with my Thin Mints, despite their 15-million-box surplus.</p><p>Returning to normal is going to take a while. Maybe the Trader Joe's shoppers are actually saving the planet, and I should be grateful. Or maybe, like Japan, masks are here to stay as a sign that we care about others. That's OK. Do what you want. Just stop giving stink eye to the rest of us.</p><p>---</p><p>Write to kessler@wsj.com</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Kessler Isn't Excluded From California's Vaccine Lottery\" -- WSJ June 24, 2021)</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: The Great Masking Dilemma in Trader Joe's\" -- WSJ June 28, 2021)</p>",
