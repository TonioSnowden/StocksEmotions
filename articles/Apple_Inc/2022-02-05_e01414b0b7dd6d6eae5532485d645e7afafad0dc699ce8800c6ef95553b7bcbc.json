  "text": "<p>Meta attributed its reduced outlook for advertising sales in part to Apple Inc.'s change in privacy policies for users of iPhones and other devices. But Meta also said in its earnings release that it had been “hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets.”</p><p>In his Revolution Investing column, Cody Willard (a long-term Meta/Facebook shareholder) wrote that the above comment from Meta was a warning of a possible slowing of economic growth, because of the scale of the company's advertising business — roughly $115 billion in 2021 — and the fact that it serves customers of all sizes. Still, he expects Meta to be a long-term winner as it builds out its “metaverse.”</p><p>More coverage of Facebook's results, stock plunge and reaction:</p><p>Facebook owner Meta loses record $232 billion in market value after ‘saying the quiet part out loud'</p><p>Meta CFO cries ‘wolf' again with bleak Facebook outlook — but he may be right this time</p><p>Facebook wasn't Thursday's only big loser — these 16 other Nasdaq-100 stocks dropped at least 5%</p><p>Facebook parent's over 25% stock plunge spotlights peril for ETF investors of big single-stock exposures</p><p>Facebook is one of only four companies in the S&amp;P 500 to make this remarkable achievement over the past 10 years — and its stock is already cheap</p><p>Amazon's holiday-quarter earnings euphoria is worth a second look</p><p>The market's reaction to Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN quarterly earnings report was completely different from what happened with Meta/Facebook. Amazon's stock was up as much as 12% in morning trading on Feb. 4 on the heels of a fourth-quarter profit of $14.3 billion, or $27.75 a share, that blew past the consensus estimate among analysts polled by FactSet of $3.61. But Amazon said it booked $11.8 billion in pretax unrealized gains on its investment in Rivian Automotive Inc. RIVN, which went public in November.</p><p>Accounting rules put in place in 2018 force companies to reflect unrealized gains or losses on stock investments in their net income. Amazon said its operating income for the fourth quarter declined to $3.5 billion from $6.9 billion a year earlier.</p><p>To be sure, Amazon has traditionally focused on plowing its cash flow back into the company to increase sales and expand into new areas, rather than showing high profits.</p><p>Its Amazon Web Services unit increased its operating income to $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter from $3.6 billion a year earlier. So AWS provided operating earnings exceeding that for all of Amazon, even though its fourth-quarter sales of $17.8 billion was 13% of Amazon's total sales. Sales at AWS for the fourth quarter were up 40% from a year earlier, while Amazon's total sales were up 9%.</p><p>More coverage of Amazon:</p><p>Amazon repurchased stock in January, for the first time in a decade</p><p>Amazon increases Prime subscription price in U.S. as membership tops 200 million</p><p>Here's how much Amazon Prime's price has gone up over the years</p><p>Prime Prices Will Go Up and People May Unsubscribe.

The idea is that many investors will shy away from a stock with a very high price, but might jump in after a split, even though the split itself makes no fundamental change to a company or its stock's fundamentals.</p><p>In the age of computerized trading and with decades having passed since investors were required to buy shares in “round lots” of 100, many thriving companies have resisted slitting their shares, even when prices rise into the thousands. But Alphabet Inc. GOOGGOOGL plans a 20-for-one split on July 15, for shareholders of record as of July 1, subject to a shareholder approval vote.</p><p>This raises the question of whether or not investors should incorporate stock splits into their decision-making.
