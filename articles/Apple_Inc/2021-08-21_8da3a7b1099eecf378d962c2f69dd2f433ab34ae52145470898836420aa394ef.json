  "text": "<p>I stopped collecting baseball cards when I was about 13, but I saved Mickey Mantle's 1958 Topps baseball card because it was the first one I remember getting out of a pack when I was 6 years old. In 1986, Sports Illustrated wrote a short piece about how I always keep it on me, so ever since people regularly come up to me and ask, \"Do you really have that Mantle card on you?\" And I don't want to disappoint them. For more than 50 years, I've been carrying it around in my wallet or jacket, but it is no longer the original card. I've gotten about two dozen of them in the mail from strangers, from fans, who know how much I love my Mantle card.</p><p>I know a lot of people swear by the Kindle, but I like to hold a book in my hands. The last great baseball book I read was 'The Wax Pack.' This guy took a random pack of baseball cards from 1986, and whoever was in that pack, he tried to track them down.</p><p>I don't know how we ever lived before cellphones. If I don't take my phone with me and I'm gone for an hour, that's certainly when all hell will break loose. But I'm one of the great technophobes. I have an iPhone now but until about three years ago I was defiant about it. I even had a flip phone, a Pantech Breeze 3, and I still keep its corpse in my desk. Opening it is like prying off the lid of Tutankhamun's tomb.</p><p>In California, I have a man-cave where I've got three TVs, a bigger one and two smaller ones above it on the wall. That way I can watch three Sunday morning news shows at the same time, or multiple sports events with two of them muted and the volume up on one.</p><p>-- Edited from an interview by Matthew Kitchen</p>",
