  "text": "<p>In February 2021, Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer took a road trip from New York to an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama, where they hoped to learn how the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had initiated a union election there.</p> <p>Smalls, who had recently been fired from an Amazon facility on Staten Island in New York for organising a walkout over its Covid-19 protocols, thought that the professional organisers from RWDSU did not take him and Palmer seriously, as he later recounted in media interviews. </p> <p>The RWDSU's campaign lost that election by nearly a two-to-one margin, and the outcome of second election ordered by labour regulators is still too close to call. Smalls, however, managed to steer his upstart Amazon Labor Union to a decisive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c9fe555-6ac7-47ff-bff2-877a43b0b871\">win</a> on Staten Island, making the warehouse the ecommerce giant's first unionised facility.</p> <p>The Staten Island workers' victory stunned not just Amazon but also labour leaders, many of whom had begun to believe that organising a union at such a large and influential company was impossible. </p> <p>RWDSU, which represents over 60,000 retail and food processing workers in the US, had tried to organise workers at the same Staten Island facility in 2018 without success. Another prominent US union, the Teamsters — which has more than 100 years of organising experience and 1.3mn members — had been working to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2021/11/11/teamster-union-mobilizing-members-against-amazon/?sh=39ec04c551a2\">unionise</a> Amazon drivers for years. </p> <p>That Smalls and his friends were able to do what better-resourced unions could not with only the proceeds of a GoFundMe campaign and the help of a pro bono lawyer has raised questions over whether the labour movement has become too out of touch with young people and workers of colour.</p> <p>“The workers in that warehouse and the next warehouse that's going to vote have pushed the boundaries of what's possible and have changed the conversation around where, how and who the demands for a union are coming from in this country,” said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). “I just think that is a phenomenal step forward for the entire labour movement.”</p> <p>Professional labour activists will be watching closely as the Amazon Labour Union faces its second test on Monday, as workers at a smaller facility across the street begin casting ballots in their own union election. It is unclear if the grassroots strategies that succeeded the first time — such as connecting over home-cooked meals and bus stop bonfires — will produce the same results at other facilities. </p> <p>Some union leaders are hoping that a second win could build momentum for other organising drives and push the broader labour movement to continue to invest in younger workers of colour.</p> <p>Employers have frequently painted national unions as greedy organisations seeking to add members to fill their coffers with dues payments, in an effort to stem organising in their own workplaces. That line and other fear-based tactics have been especially effective at keeping workers from organising, and contributing to an erosion of public trust in unions themselves.</p> <p>Americans' opinions of the unions have been steadily improving — a higher share of Americans approve of labour unions today than at any point since 1965, according to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/354455/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx\">Gallup</a> — even as membership has been largely stagnant. US labour data shows that <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm\">10.3 per cent</a> of US workers were union members in 2021, slightly down from 10.8 per cent in 2020.</p> <p>But a tight labour market has shifted the power towards employees, and fresh memories of declining working conditions during the start of the Covid crisis have made many more willing to challenge their employer by organising, according to Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labour education research at Cornell University.</p> <p>“It was a wake-up call for those who were pooh-poohing the ability of that campaign and had been sitting back and saying, ‘we can't organise anything big',” said Bronfenbrenner. “That had been their excuse. Many, many unions had said that we have to wait for labour law reform. They can't make that excuse any more.”</p> <p>“I think in many cases, workers are ahead of the unions,” said D Taylor, the president of the hospitality industry union Unite Here. “I think the union movement often thinks about where the workforce was 10 or 15 years ago, not where it is today. I think we all realise workers are there, very frustrated, very angry, and they're looking for a solution. And we should be that solution.”</p> <p>Some unions have reached out to younger workers and workers of colour by carving out smaller, worker-led groups within the national unions. The groups of Starbucks baristas that have formed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33d605b8-2025-48cf-9f2e-60f8f97cfd3b\">unions</a> at 20 stores across the country have branded themselves as Starbucks Workers United, although they are affiliated with a larger union, SEIU. </p> <p>Employees at an Apple Store in Atlanta's Cumberland Mall structured their union similarly, forming the Apple Workers Union with the backing of Communications Workers of America.</p> <p>If successful, these union drives could give organised labour its first footholds in two largely non-union industries: food services and tech. Starbucks and Apple are among the most prominent consumer-facing brands in the US, employing 349,000 and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/job-creation/\">80,000</a> people respectively.</p> <p>“This is about where the economy goes,” said Taylor. “We'll either take advantage of [the moment] or the question will become whether we will continue to exist.”</p><p>Source: Taylor Nicole Rogers in New York 2022 'How Amazon's unlikely union reflects the changing face of US labour movement' FT.com 24 April.
