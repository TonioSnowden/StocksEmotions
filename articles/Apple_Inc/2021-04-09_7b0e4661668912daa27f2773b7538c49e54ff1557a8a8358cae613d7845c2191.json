  "text": "<p>We looked out for each other. We had to. My parents were alcoholics. They weren't mean drunks. They just weren't present.</p><p>Our farmhouse and barn were built by my mother's father after he purchased 600 acres in the 1940s. We lived 4 1/2 miles from the main road and 2 miles from the nearest neighbor.</p><p>The property straddled Vermont and Massachusetts, with the state line running through our small guesthouse. We had chickens, a 2-acre vegetable garden, and a stream and beaver pond. My chores included mucking out the chicken coop and weeding.</p><p>In the summer, my stepbrother and I sold zucchini and tomatoes on the dirt road at the end of our quarter-mile driveway. Hours went by before a car appeared and stopped out of pity.</p><p>My mother, Jo, and stepfather, Bob, were completely ill-equipped to live in the country. I think we moved there so no one could see them drink. He had eight children but seven were older and out of the house. I was alone most of the time, except for my stepbrother, and my imagination grew. I invented entire scenarios in the woods and fields.</p><p>I learned later that my mother had started drinking heavily after my real father left. He worked at Playboy in the early '60s and bought into the bachelor culture.</p><p>As a child, I didn't see my real father much after he left. The bitterness remained with my mother for the rest of her life.</p><p>When I was 12, someone in school told me about the Arena Civic Theatre in nearby Greenfield, Mass. I auditioned for \"Hansel and Gretel\" and was cast as Hansel. From then on, acting was for me.</p><p>In school, I was troubled, probably because I wasn't well liked. I was a loner whose dreams intimidated other kids. I'd tell them, \"One day I'm going to be a famous actress.\" They'd call me weird or that I needed my head examined.</p><p>My sisters were book smart and attended Northfield Mount Hermon, an elite boarding school, about a half-hour from our house. It wasn't difficult for me to get in. But I didn't want to go. My mother said if I refused, I should stick a pin in a map and we'd move there.</p><p>I decided to attend Mount Hermon. At the start of my senior year, I was kicked out for two offenses: I stole English muffins from the dining hall. And my friends and I made a phony phone call to the school infirmary.</p><p>By then, my mother's marriage had dissolved and she was living in North Carolina. But she wouldn't let me stay with her. My fallback was sleeping on my stepdad's sofa in Chicago.</p><p>I finished high school there and studied acting at the Goodman School of Drama, a conservatory. My acting teacher, Bella Itkin, was a huge inspiration. So was my classmate, Ann Dowd, an exceptional actress.</p><p>After college, I worked in Chicago for a couple of years. In 1982, I moved to New York with $500 and stayed with my sister, who was in finance.</p><p>After spotting an audition notice for the national tour of \"Brighton Beach Memoirs,\" I landed the Nora Morton part and wound up in that role on Broadway in 1984.</p><p>Later in life, my mother became sober, went back to school, got her degree and became a social worker specializing in alcohol rehabilitation. She was one of my best friends. She died in 2016.</p><p>Today, I live with my husband, cinematographer Julio Macat, north of Los Angeles. We moved in 17 years ago. I love the house because of its fast access to the 405 Freeway.</p><p>A house is home, and home is about my husband, four kids and our dogs. Memories were always more important to me than things. Now I wish I owned our family farmhouse and land. Four years ago, I returned and tried to buy it. The owner wouldn't sell. I'm hoping one day he will.</p><p>-- As told to Marc Myers</p><p>---</p><p>Elizabeth Perkins, 60, is a stage, TV and film actress who has starred in \"Big,\" \"Weeds\" (Showtime) and \"Truth Be Told\" (Apple TV+). She co-stars in Fox's comedy series \"The Moodys.\"</p><p>---</p><p>ELIZABETHAN DRAMAS</p><p>What's \"The Moodys\" about? It's a comedy about a snippy married couple and their three eccentric kids.</p><p>Your role? Ann Moody, the mom.</p><p>Breakthrough film? \"Big\" (1988), as Tom Hanks's girlfriend.</p><p>Ever see your real dad again? Yes, we semi-resolved things later in life, thanks to my stepmother, Judy.</p>",
