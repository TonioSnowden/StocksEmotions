  "title": "Made in Manhattan: the best New York films",
  "text": "<p>Hollywood is the factory but New York is the stage. To a film lover, the city is less a location than a genre unto itself. A New York movie is a New York movie before anything else, for all that you might call it a romance or a thriller. Like a singer delivering an old jazz standard, great films set in the city each take the same essential melody — yellow cabs and brownstones, the skyline and the mayhem below&#xa0; — and make it their own. </p> <p>Watching films in New York itself is a hall-of-mirrors business. At least once I've stepped out of a Manhattan cinema into the same street where the movie I just watched had its final scene. (You remind yourself the credits have rolled and get coffee.) But here are a dozen films to transport you to New York wherever you really are. It could run to a hundred, I know. We'll get to the others in the sequels.</p> <h2>After Hours</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: available to stream on </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/After-Hours-Cheech-Marin/dp/B00ET1H0CW\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/after-hours/id284949745\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=after+hours+film\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>The temptation is to fill this piece with nothing but films by Little Italy's own Martin Scorsese. But I'm choosing one, with due respect to <em>Taxi Driver</em> and the rest. Wildly underrated, <em>After Hours</em> (1985) — a screwball black comedy set over a single night — is also an express ticket to the Downtown Manhattan of the 1980s. The movie finds a hapless office worker (Griffin Dunne) on a date that spirals into a life-or-death odyssey. But an odyssey in one place — a SoHo still stuffed with artists' lofts and dive bars.</p> <h2>Midnight Cowboy&#xa0;</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Midnight-Cowboy-Bob/dp/B00FYPAZB0\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/midnight-cowboy/id416960943\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrMYd4t65U\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>Possibly not the favourite film of city tourism authorities when it came out in 1969, director John Schlesinger's plaintive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd4b35a6-d4a2-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77\">buddy movie</a> took place in multiple New Yorks. Deluxe Park Avenue, a hip Andy Warhol-ish underground and, most bittersweet of all, a sad strata of doomed hustlers — they all shared the screen. Watch it once and you'll never be able to hear John Barry's wistful theme tune again without seeing Dustin Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo, asserting himself on a crosswalk: “I'm walkin' here!” There spoke a New Yorker. </p> <h2>Do the Right Thing</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Right-Thing-Ossie-Davis/dp/B01BIBU0YU\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/do-the-right-thing/id282538466\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=do+the+right+thing\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>A journey out of Manhattan across the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7454d1c8-ad18-4fcd-b642-c26cd1e0bd9f\">Brooklyn</a> Bridge brings you to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bedford-Stuyvesant,+Brooklyn,+NY,+USA/@40.6885842,-73.9511402,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25c75b6a8b821:0xf3bc87276691ebdc!8m2!3d40.6872176!4d-73.9417735\">Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>, scene of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1035109-b441-4cb2-bef3-240505875f4b\">Spike Lee</a>'s early career masterpiece. Like Scorsese, Lee grew up in New York and has often returned to the city for subject matter, and here he made the definitive study of a heatwave both literal and otherwise — an electric vision of culture clash and community, youth, old age, music, politics, love, hate and everything in between that is still as vital as the day it was released in 1989. </p> <h2>Man on Wire</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Wire-Ardis-Campbell/dp/B00ESZYCVG\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/man-on-wire/id295525878\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=man+on+wire\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>Beyond breathtaking — if also touched by melancholy — the documentary <em>Man on Wire</em> is made by one outsider to the city, British director James Marsh, about another, Philippe Petit. The latter arrived in New York in 1974 as a French high-wire artist with an unbelievable plan — to illicitly sling a tightrope between the Twin Towers and walk the result. You would expect the film to be a shot of adrenaline — it is — but the surprise is how strangely tranquil it can be too.</p> <h2>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Taking-Pelham-One-Two-Three/dp/B000IZ8SB0\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/the-taking-of-pelham-one-two-three/id279300076\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-kingrIwYQ\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>Made the same year Petit walked his high wire, this glorious crime thriller went underground instead. You could hardly hope to visit New York through movies without taking the subway, and here you will find the expertly clammy story of a hijacked 6 train, come to rest under 28th Street. The thin blue line of the transit police is played by Walter Matthau, his very accent a local wonder, made in the Lower East Side.</p> <h2>Breakfast at Tiffany's</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Breakfast-At-Tiffanys-George-Peppard/dp/B00FYNYBJY\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/breakfast-at-tiffanys/id208560505\"><em>iTunes</em></a></p> <p>As so often with great New York movies, the interiors of <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em> (1961) were a Hollywood creation, shot on soundstages on the Paramount lot. But interiors are overrated. Was it that the real locations — first among them the <a href=\"https://www.tiffany.co.uk/jewelry-stores/new-york-5th-avenue/\">Fifth Avenue flagship Tiffany &amp; Co</a> — were timeless? Or did the movie make them so? As Audrey Hepburn gazed into the jeweller's window in the opening scene, she was accompanied off camera by hundreds of curious New Yorkers — watching as a storefront&#xa0;was made a cinema landmark.</p> <h2>Uncut Gems</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80990663\"><em>Netflix</em></a></p> <p>Just a few blocks south of Tiffany's is a different New York to the high society of Holly Golightly. Another kind of movie too. The <a href=\"http://diamonddistrict.org/\">Diamond District</a> of West 47th Street is a place of rough-hewn buying and selling, a singular spot that became the backdrop for the frantic <em>Uncut Gems</em> (2019). The nonstop story of a jewel dealer with a gambling habit, it isn't just the Midtown locations that take you to New York. It's the pitch the movie plays at too — a crazed, cacophonous, irresistible rush hour of a film.</p> <h2>Saturday Night Fever&#xa0;</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Saturday-Night-Fever-John-Travolta/dp/B00FZJBSQ6\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/saturday-night-fever/id286096847\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZTP586-Y9E\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>Another Brooklyn story, the 1977 movie that made a star of John Travolta is sometimes thought of as a fun glitterball of a film. The white suit, the dance-floor strut — all are in place. But it's not quite what that reputation suggests. A gritty story of Catholic guilt and dead-end frustration, it also gives us a version of the city that rarely makes it on screen — an outer borough tour of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bay+Ridge,+Brooklyn,+NY,+USA/@40.6222025,-74.0855514,13.05z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2455f3f1cab0d:0xa5a45198ea4d73d6!8m2!3d40.6263732!4d-74.0298767\">Bay Ridge</a> and the <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/bridges-and-tunnels/about/verrazzano-narrows-bridge\">Verrazzano—Narrows Bridge</a>.</p> <h2>Frances Ha</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Frances-Ha-Greta-Gerwig/dp/B00I9LQQL4\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/frances-ha/id1539719881\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdxCnCvCngk\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <p>As generations of New Yorkers have found, staying in the city through hard times can be a Herculean task. In fact, the financially stretched heroine of Noah Baumbach's spry comedy <em>Frances Ha</em> (2012) — played by co-writer Greta Gerwig — briefly bounces out altogether (as far as Paris). And yet she returns, still smitten. The movie makes hay with the eternal stuff of being young and late with the rent in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9660ebe-fdbb-4bf7-a554-e88902538768\">Prospect Heights</a> and Chinatown.</p> <h2>Desperately Seeking Susan</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Desperately-Seeking-Susan-Seidelman/dp/B01A8ZV08M\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/desperately-seeking-susan/id825871352\"><em>iTunes</em></a></p> <p>So many films and not one set in a New York movie theatre. Let's correct the oversight with <em>Desperately Seeking Susan</em>, a charming '80s indie romcom made on the overlap of the city's post-punk and clubland scenes, with key moments shot in the now defunct Bleecker Street Cinema. The film was a surprise hit through the sudden fame of its co-star, Madonna. She is good in it, I swear. The conjuring of Greenwich Village and <a href=\"https://www.thebattery.org/\">Battery Park</a> are even better.</p> <h2>Killer's Kiss</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Killers-Kiss-Stanley-Kubrick/dp/B01FYLEGGI\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/killers-kiss/id298343418\"><em>iTunes</em></a></p> <p>Not every great director who came of age in New York made endless movies there. Like Spike Lee and Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick spent his youth in the city. Unlike them, he only made New York films at either end of his career. The looming <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> was his last — among his first was <em>Killer's Kiss </em>(1955), a quick and dirty boxing-noir that doubles as a vivid snapshot of Kubrick's home town. Filming guerrilla-style without permits, the young maestro takes in a frantic Times Square, the Beaux Arts grandeur of the original Pennsylvania Station (demolished in 1963) and the warehouse hinterlands of <a href=\"https://www.bkmag.com/2016/10/11/reel-brooklyn-killers-kiss-dumbo/\">Dumbo</a>, ghostly under the Manhattan Bridge.</p> <h2>Summer of Soul</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb\"><em>Disney+</em></a></p> <p>And to end, the most recent film on the list but one that actually dates back to 1969. That was the year of the first and only Harlem Cultural Festival, a rolling inner-city celebration of black music. The film shot to capture the event then sat dusty and forgotten until a belated release in 2021. The performances are spellbinding — I defy anyone to sit unmoving through Sly and the Family Stone's soaring <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7lL2lMWNtzOcf5HnEudNgn?si=eb5a9551ec514182\">“Everyday People”</a> — but the headline act is Harlem itself. One Sunday as the music played, man walked on the moon. No mean feat but a small wonder compared to Harlem. </p> <p><em>Danny Leigh is the FT's film critic</em></p> <p><em>Are you a globetrotter?
