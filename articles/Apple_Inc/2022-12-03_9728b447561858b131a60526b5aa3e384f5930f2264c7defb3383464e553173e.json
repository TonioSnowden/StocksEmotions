  "text": "<p>\n  James Gillray: A Revolution in Satire </p><p>\n  By Tim Clayton </p><p>\n  Yale, 400 pages, $65 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In 1779, Napoleon Bonaparte, having seized power in France, appealed to George III for an end to the eight years of war that had followed the French Revolution. Britain's foreign secretary, Lord Grenville, replied that France, if it really wanted peace, should restore its legitimate monarchy. Samuel Whitbread, an opposition MP, argued for talks with Napoleon, saying that power, however attained, must be respected. </p><p>\n  The episode sparked an especially caustic illustration -- what we would call a political cartoon -- from the British satirist James Gillray (1756-1815). It showed Napoleon in a peculiar landscape setting. He seems to have rolled down from a dunghill mushroomed with French notables (Voltaire among them) and into a stream where \"royal pippins\" -- a kind of apple here signifying real legitimacy -- float alongside him. \"We apples,\" Napoleon says, though we can see that he doesn't belong in their number. He is a foul intruder. </p><p>\n  Napoleon was the butt of other Gillray drawings. As Tim Clayton shows us in \"James Gillray: A Revolution in Satire,\" the French emperor -- and menace to peace -- was depicted as a tinpot tyrant. In a Gillray illustration playing off \"Gulliver's Travels,\" a puzzled George III peers through a telescope at a tiny Napoleon standing in an angry pose on the king's outstretched hand. The French generally come in for rough Gillray treatment. In another drawing, Parisian revolutionaries appear as cannibals. </p><p>\n  These works capture Gillray's style, juxtaposing vulgarity with literary allusion and extravagant caricature with sharp draftsmanship. Mr. Clayton's well-researched and lavishly illustrated study makes a strong case for Gillray as the creator of a genre of graphic art -- and as a forceful commentator. The artist's caricatures shaped how the public saw politicians and royal figures, not to mention socialites and literary celebrities. Today's political cartoonists quite properly credit Gillray as a major forerunner. </p><p>\n  Even people unfamiliar with Gillray himself will recognize his work, so often is it reproduced: The drawings have a kind of caption-commentary running along the bottom edge, presented in handwritten script. Dialogue bubbles float out from the mouths of his figures, matching words to their expressive features. Mr. Clayton aptly likens the images to a frozen moment in a stage drama or broader narrative. \"Like poems conceived as a sequence,\" he writes, \"Gillray's prints reinforce each other.\" </p><p>\n  Avoiding grotesque invention, Gillray went beyond simple reality with (in the words of the 20th-century cartoonist David Low) \"a discriminating exaggeration of truth.\" Thus, in \"The Lover's Dream,\" we see the Prince of Wales (in the 1790s) sweetly sleeping on a luxurious royal bed and dreaming of the queen swooping down, like an angel in a Renaissance painting, to pay his enormous debts. Mr. Clayton's selection takes readers on a journey through Georgian politics and society with a guide who spared no one. </p><p>\n  The decades from 1770 to 1800 were turbulent ones, to say the least: George III struggled with the American Revolution and its aftermath and with factionalism in Parliament; the effort to reform the East India Co., with its fantastic wealth, sparked further discord. Abroad, France collapsed into disorder and revolution before spreading war across the Continent. Economic strains in Britain increased social tensions. The fashions and manners of the times tended toward the extravagant and self-indulgent, modes of living at odds with George III's moral code and the emerging Methodist piety. </p><p>\n  Amid such tumult and change, political prints, often displayed in shop windows, became a barometer of popular sentiment. Their ridicule targeted all kinds of vice and folly in a version of social commentary that ordinary viewers grasped more quickly than pamphlets and verse (such as Alexander Pope's \"Dunciad\"). Visual caricature joined what one victim called \"the artillery of slander.\" </p><p>\n  Little documentation of Gillray's life survives beyond his art, but Mr. Clayton manages to pull together an effective biographical narrative. Born in 1754 to a soldier, Gillray attended a school run by the Moravian Brethren, a strict Protestant sect with a bleak view of human nature. He may well have toured with a theater company, widening his range of literary reference. As a young man he apprenticed to an engraver, learning the basic techniques of etching and calligraphy. His time at the Royal Academy Schools, in London, exposed him to history paintings and portraits. He would later use Sir Joshua Reynolds's portrait of Banastre Tarleton -- a rake and gambler who rose to prominence as an officer in the American Revolution -- as the template for a cartoon in which Tarleton is merely a bullying braggart. </p><p>\n  Early in his career, Gillray engraved popular new paintings and older works for sale as reproductions, but his prickly temper cost him commissions for fine prints. He turned increasingly to caricature, a form he had pursued before only as a sideline. Here he was to discover his genius. One of his earliest efforts, from 1779, was titled \"The Liberty of the Subject.\" It shows a poor tailor being press-ganged into naval service -- a form of conscription that Gillray thought well beyond the lawful practice of forcing merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. Another early drawing is called \"Politeness\": A paunchy, scowling Englishman sits on a chair with beer in hand and roast beef nearby while a disdainful, aristocratic Frenchman pinches his snuff. Each makes a sneering comment to the other. </p><p>\n  Many Gillray caricatures were commissioned, the topics pitched by others. Mr. Clayton emphasizes that Gillray was an equal-opportunity satirist, lampooning members of the establishment as well as their critics. His early patrons included the siblings William and Hannah Humphrey, London print sellers, as well as Elizabeth d'Archery, a publisher who brokered commissions and pushed him toward satire. William Holland, another patron, suggested Samuel Johnson as a target. In a famous drawing, Gillray shows the Doctor wearing a kind of dunce cap and being pursued by Apollo and the Muses, who seem eager to thrash him for his critical judgments. </p><p>\n  The heated political atmosphere during the American Revolution fed the demand for caricature, as did parliamentary politics. Gillray often showed Charles James Fox, the Whig leader, as a heavy-set, scruffy hedonist and Edmund Burke as a purse-lipped, Jesuit-like figure. Literary parody became one of Gillray's favorite modes. As the uncompromising leader of the opposition, Fox inspired comparison with Satan in \"Paradise Lost\" -- pridefully reigning in hell rather than serving in heaven. </p><p>\n  Gillray was the first caricaturist to satirize the royal family, including George III, shown in one drawing with a notably plump face as he toasts a muffin. (The king had a horror of getting fat.) The king's sons -- with their notorious debauchery -- offered richer targets. Pitt the Younger, as prime minister, fared badly too. A pension Gillray later received from the government didn't blunt his critical tone. Mr. Clayton suggests that Gillray's willingness to caricature radicals helped him avoid prosecution. The multiple levels of satire in a single work also allowed him to mock both sides of a question. </p><p>\n  Gillray's close relationship with Hannah Humphrey dominated his later years. He and Hannah almost married, but he backed out on the way to church, feeling that their partnership would work better if they remained as friends. Failing eyesight and depression, exacerbated by hard drinking, took its toll. In 1811, Gillray threw himself from a window, suffering serious injury. Humphrey cared for him until he died in 1815, at age 58. </p><p>\n  Within a decade, public taste began to change as Georgian exuberance yielded to the staid mores of the Victorians. Caricature lost its edge. Mr. Clayton, while highlighting the skill it takes \"to invest a single print, inspired by some passing episode, with such depth and resonance\" -- a skill Gillray possessed in abundance -- concedes that it is difficult for us now to understand the humor of an earlier age. But his thoughtful survey of Gillray's work admirably overcomes that challenge -- and reminds us just how potent satire can be. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Hay is the author of \"Lord Liverpool: A Political Life.\" </p><p></p>",
