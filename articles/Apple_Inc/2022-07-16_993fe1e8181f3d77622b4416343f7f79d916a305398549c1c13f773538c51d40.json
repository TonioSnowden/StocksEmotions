  "text": "<p>To see for yourself, head to one (or all) of these five new spots that Paris-bound food-lovers shouldn't skip this summer. Just be warned: Since tourism in the city has notably recovered, you'll want to book tables as far in advance as possible.</p><p>L'Auberge Nicolas Flamel</p><p>Allegedly one of the oldest restaurants in the city, L'Auberge Nicolas Flamel has become a destination again under a new Michelin-starred chef, Gregory Garimbay. Tucked in an ancient stone house in the upper Marais, the Scandi-style rooms and bare oak tables feel as modern as the young chef's ever-changing menu. Mr. Garimbay's haute cuisine background shows through in the precision of dishes like white asparagus garnished with quinoa, lemon and black garlic; sea bass with zucchini, green strawberries and green anise seeds; and chocolate ganache flavored with malt and beer. 51 Rue de Montmorency, 3rd Arrondissement, Paris, Tel. +33-01-42-71-77-78, Auberge.Nicolas-Flamel.fr</p><p>La Halle aux Grains</p><p>Situated atop a new art museum in Paris's old Bourse de Commerce, La Halle aux Grains' airy dining room offers superb views over Les Halles, the storied district (nicknamed the \"belly of Paris\") that once held the city's main food market. Celebrated father-and-son chefs Michel and Sebastien Bras -- the elder of whom won three Michelin stars for his restaurant in Auvergne in the late-90s -- prove gastronomic talent runs in the blood with an intriguing menu of rustic but urbane dishes like lamb sweetbreads sauteed with buckwheat butter, wilted lettuce and lemon-infused olive oil; roast mutton with pureed celeriac; and an apple and fennel tart with milk mousse. After you stroll the museum, indulge ideally in lunch. 2 Rue de Viarmes, 1st Arrondissement, Paris, Tel. +33-01-82-71-71-60, HalleAuxGrains.bras.fr</p><p>Orgueil</p><p>Hidden away in a residential neighborhood in the 11th Arrondissement, chef Eloi Spinnler's restaurant Orgueil (which means \"pride\" in French) has been making good on its name since opening earlier this year. It wows with beautifully prepared small plates that belie their practical roots in zero-waste philosophy. The project originates in Mr. Spinnler's training in haute-cuisine kitchens, where routinely as much as 30% of the produce delivered ends up discarded. \"We aim to run [things] as ecologically as possible,\" said the chef, who also hews to the philosophy, popularized by late chef Bernard Loiseau, that any dish with more than three ingredients is too complicated. Duck croquettes with sesame and cream cheese and an exquisitely-made savory pie stuffed with pigeon and foie gras are just two delectable examples of his cosmopolitan and conscientious cooking. 6 Rue Popincourt, 11th Arrondissement, Paris, Tel. +33-01-83-97-34-80, HubrisGroupe.com</p><p>Tekes</p><p>With the arrival of Tekes, Paris finally has a vegetarian destination so good even carnivores are clamoring for reservations. The restaurant takes its name from the Hebrew word for ceremony -- and that celebratory spirit shines through chefs Assaf Granit, Cecile Levy and Dan Yosha's modernized Levantine menu. Come for dishes like mushroom and pine nut \"chicken liver\" and rotisseried celeriac lacquered with pomegranate molasses -- and stay for the outstanding wine list, too. 4 bis Rue Saint-Sauveur, 2nd Arrondissement, Paris, Tel. +33-07-81-42-54-74, TekesRestaurant.com</p><p>Parcelles</p><p>Of all the recent debuts, none has received such unanimous critical praise as Parcelles, restaurateur Sarah Michielsen's cozy bistrot a vins. Chef Julien Chevallier cooks exactly the kind of chic Gallic comfort food that Parisians want to eat right now -- like clams steamed in dashi broth, veal sweetbreads with fried sage leaves and what just may be the best creme caramel in town -- and sommelier Bastien Fidelin has assembled one of the most interesting and refreshingly affordable wine lists going. Bonus: With its copper-topped bar, factory chandeliers and a vintage cracked-tile floor, the dining room is heavy on Parisian charm. 13 Rue Chapon, 3rd Arrondissement, Paris, Tel. +33-01-43-37-91-64, Parcelles-Paris.fr</p>",
