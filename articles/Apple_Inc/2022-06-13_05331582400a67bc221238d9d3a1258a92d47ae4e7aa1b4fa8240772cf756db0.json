  "text": "<p>(St. Martin's, 278 pages, $28.99)</p><p>Interviewing job candidates is often likened to a first date. You hope what you're looking for is out there, but in the interest of time you might ignore some red flags and settle for someone who looks good on paper. Add to that a scarcity of viable candidates and you may feel pressure to make an even hastier-than-usual decision to commit.</p><p>If you're setting your sights on The One, however -- at least at your company or organization -- consider taking a rigorous approach. In \"Talent: How to Identify Energizers, Creatives, and Winners Around the World,\" Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross offer some methods for evaluating whether a person really is colleague material.</p><p>The authors have some talent-spotting credentials: Mr. Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, has been involved in academic hiring and graduate admissions; Mr. Gross, through a venture-capital firm called Pioneer, looks to fund promising startups. Together, they want to upend the typical hiring process with the aim of finding acceptable candidates \"capable of commanding consensus by being decent but most of all sufficiently unobjectionable.\"</p><p>They recommend focusing on hiring people whose potential might be overlooked because of their unusual backgrounds. \"Both of us,\" they say, \"think of ourselves as examples of initially hidden talent, and that is part of the reason we wish to help you find other outsiders for your ventures.\" By \"outsiders\" they seem to mean people who didn't follow a traditional career trajectory. Mr. Gross was a gamer who didn't attend college (instead, he started a company that was later bought by Apple); Mr. Cowen began his career as a blogger.</p><p>So how do you identify the underrated outliers? By focusing on the qualities that best suit the role, rather than on resume line items. The personality you'd want for a startup founder (a disagreeable visionary open to experimenting with new ideas) isn't the same as you'd like for a CFO (a highly conscientious worker with an aversion to excessive risk). For the authors, the ideal employees, regardless of what's on their C.V., have the mental stamina of a medical resident and the drive for self-improvement of a concert pianist.</p><p>Once you've figured out the must-have criteria, the authors suggest asking interview questions designed to get candidates to let down their guard. Questions like \"What did you do this morning?\" or \"What are the open tabs on your browser right now?\" build rapport, potentially leading to some surprising answers. Once you segue into a tougher question like \"What have you achieved that is unusual for your peer group?\" Messrs. Cowen and Gross recommend asking it repeatedly to extract unrehearsed responses. During the ensuing awkwardness, the authors coach, \"don't look away, break the tension with a chuckle, or give the candidate a chance to divert attention.\" At this point, prospective employees might suspect they're being pranked and start looking for hidden cameras.</p><p>Another tactic the authors suggest: taking the interview offsite. In a cafe, for example, you can see how candidates interact with servers, stand in line (next to or behind you) or react to noise. Some of the authors' other ideas for nonwork outings might raise HR eyebrows: An interview at a basketball game may be fun for some but highly discomfiting to others, many women included.</p><p>But women (and minorities, for that matter) aren't the intended audience of this book; it's primarily for white men trying to navigate the new workplace in the wake of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. On the one hand, the authors recognize the double-edged sword that women face in the office: Often less confident than men, women are frequently passed over for promotions, yet when they're assertive, they're labeled as bossy. The authors encourage picking the rare confident woman who is undervalued in the market (read: a bargain), thus gaining, they write, \"from the world's statistical discrimination and in the process rectify[ing] an injustice.\" On the other hand, the authors seem to think of women as sexual minefields. When men interview women, Messrs. Cowen and Gross point out, direct eye contact could trigger a memory of harassment. Another liability: \"In an environment of #MeToo, many men are reluctant to mentor younger women in a close or intense manner.\"</p><p>Ambitious women aren't seen as likable because, the authors posit, they can't engage in locker-room banter or hang out with men after work hours. \"A woman who fully engages in off-work socializing runs the risk of being propositioned, and in extreme cases she can be assaulted,\" they write. \"There is also the risk of coming under suspicion from the spouses of coworkers.\" This is not an enlightened view of an inclusive office culture in the 21st century.</p><p>When it comes to race, Messrs. Cowen and Gross are similarly both well-meaning and tone deaf. In their experience, African-Americans tend to be more polite in interviews, making them harder to read. To better understand (and help address your bias against) people who are different from you, the authors recommend broadening your cultural perspective: Read famous black writers, listen to some of the radical takes on race, and maybe visit a black church, where \"you will be welcomed heartily.\"</p><p>In drawing attention to biases in the hiring process, the authors betray their own. Messrs. Cowen and Gross bemoan hiring by committee, but they might be better served by redesigning the bureaucracy to include more people who aren't like them. At Intel, diversity among new hires increased to 45% from 31% after the company required that interview panels include at least two women or employees from underrepresented groups. Software can also allow hiring managers to focus solely on talent by stripping age, gender, education and other information out of resumes.</p><p>Finding talent is only half the hiring equation. Convincing them to come work for you is the other half. In a recent Gallup poll, 42% of more than 13,000 employees surveyed said they wanted their next job to be in a diverse workplace. Candidates looking for progressive employers might very well swipe left on Messrs. Cowen and Gross.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Lanks is a New York-based editor and writer.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
