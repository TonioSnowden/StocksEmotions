  "title": "Former Apple Executive Says Company Blundered by Firing Him After TikTok Video; Tech giant, grappling with supply delays in China, has lost top negotiator Tony Blevins, who says he was quoting a movie when he made a joke at a car show",
  "text": "<p>The video, which was posted online in early September, showed Mr. Blevins getting out of his Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren at a car show and being asked what he does for a living. He responded: \"I race cars, play golf and fondle big-breasted women. But I take weekends and major holidays off.\"</p><p>The comment, Mr. Blevins said, was a reference to the 1981 comedy \"Arthur,\" in which a bawdy Dudley Moore makes a similar remark in response to a question about what he does for a living. Mr. Blevins, whose negotiating skills as a top Apple executive helped the tech giant build and maintain its formidable supply chain, was with his wife, who was laughing in the TikTok video as the two arrived at the car show.</p><p>In the early morning phone call, an Apple executive told him that he had to get the video removed immediately.</p><p>\"'This is really bad, some people have complained,'\" Mr. Blevins said he remembered the Apple executive saying.</p><p>An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Blevins, 55 years old, said he stayed up all night trying to contact the TikToker, who goes by the online name Daniel Mac and questions people driving luxury cars about what they do for a living. Mr. Blevins said he made several pleas to the social-media influencer but received no response.</p><p>Mr. Blevins said he was asked to resign and he declined. Days after the video surfaced Sept. 5, he was fired.</p><p>\"It was 22 years dissolved in about 25 seconds,\" said Mr. Blevins. He added: \"It utterly shocked me. My whole life has been Apple. I tried to be the most loyal person.\"</p><p>His departure, details of which haven't been previously reported, leaves Apple with a big hole to fill during a critical time for the company. Apple is dealing with disruptions in its supply chain, which are overwhelmingly concentrated in China. Mr. Blevins, who was a vice president of procurement, and his team of employees were responsible for negotiating with the web of suppliers that make components for Apple's products and assemble them. His negotiating abilities at the company earned him the nickname \"the Blevinator.\"</p><p>Following his firing, Mr. Blevins wasn't replaced, and instead his group was reorganized throughout Apple's operations unit, Mr. Blevins said.</p><p>The firing has left him in disbelief that something he intended as a joke, uttered to a non-Apple employee while he wasn't working, could erase a lifetime of dedication for a company he loved and believed in, Mr. Blevins said. He said he is sorry to those he offended with the comment, but he sees his firing as a blunder by Apple and a capitulation to broader cultural pressure. </p><p>'My whole life has been Apple,' says Tony Blevins. 'I tried to be the most loyal person.' PHOTO: James Jackman for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Some of his former employees support him and say that while he sometimes would use humor to deflate tense situations, they hadn't witnessed any other sexist comments or unprofessional behavior.</p><p>Others who worked for Apple say they think his firing was necessary because the company shouldn't tolerate sexist comments or behavior among managers.</p><p>Chris Deaver, a former senior human-resources official at Apple who left in 2019, said Apple takes company values on inclusion seriously, especially when it comes to potential leaders and executives. Firing Mr. Blevins was the right call, he said.</p><p>\"Leaders need to embody Apple's principles,\" Mr. Deaver said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Blevins, who grew up in the rural South, was always a somewhat unusual fit in the Cupertino, Calif., corridors of America's most valuable company, but he was embraced by Apple's leadership because of his extraordinary prowess as a negotiator, according to Mr. Blevins and former Apple employees. Starting in 2014, he was allowed to work out of his West Palm Beach, Fla., house.</p><p>In his two decades at the company, Mr. Blevins had emerged as one of an essential cadre of executives who helped build Apple into a colossus through deals with suppliers of chips, displays and other parts that were mostly assembled in Asia. With brazen tactics—such as once putting two companies competing for the same deal in neighboring rooms in a hotel while he went back and forth between them—Mr. Blevins helped Apple keep costs down and the supply of its iPhones and other gadgets secure.</p><p>After his firing, company executives were still planning a going-away party for him with invitations extended to more than 100 people, but the party was canceled when communication began breaking down between Mr. Blevins and Apple, said Mr. Blevins. He also said he didn't like the idea of Apple throwing him a party after having just fired him, calling it a \"hypocritical\" action. He said he didn't receive severance upon his departure.</p><p>Under Chief Executive Tim Cook, Apple has actively promoted its efforts to create an inclusive workplace where employees are respected, and it has said it doesn't tolerate discriminatory or demeaning behavior.</p><p>A group of employees calling themselves AppleTogether have questioned senior management about a variety of issues, petitioned for more flexible work environments and protested when Apple in 2021 hired a former Facebook executive named Antonio García Martínez. After he was hired, workers surfaced sexist passages from Mr. García Martínez's 2016 book \"Chaos Monkeys.\" He was fired a week later, with Apple at the time saying that it strived to create an inclusive workplace and that it wouldn't tolerate \"behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are.\"</p><p>Mr. García Martínez told The Wall Street Journal that Apple was aware of his book before hiring him and asked his references about it. The book doesn't represent who he is and was more a literary persona he tried to create, he said at the time.</p><p>There is a broad continuum in which a wide range of behavior including crude jokes can now be firable offenses for any corporate executives and public figures, said Davia Temin, chief executive of Temin and Company Inc., a crisis-management and marketing firm.</p><p>In some instances, companies have found opportunities for employees like Mr. Blevins or others to avoid being fired by making a quick and genuine apology, she said.</p><p>\"There could have been an opportunity from Apple and Tony to recant,\" Ms. Temin said.</p><p>The abruptness with which he was fired has left Mr. Blevins angry, he said. \"They humiliated me and damaged my reputation.\"</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Former Apple Executive Says Company Blundered by Firing Him After TikTok Video</p>",
