Here's her advice for parents on a similar timeline for college expenses.</p><p>Now may be the time to move money into bonds</p><p>Investors and advisers often discuss the ideal mix of growth- and income-style securities. During a long bull market for stocks, bonds may be unattractive, especially when interest rates are as low as they were a year ago. But now, yields on two-year U.S. Treasury bills BX:TMUBMUSD02Y have increased to 4.60% from 0.46% a year ago, and yields on 10-year Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y are at 4.23% — lower than the two-year but way above their 1.70% level at this time last year.</p><p>Even though the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will continue to increase its target range for the federal funds rate (currently 3% to 3.25%), it may be a good idea to move money into bonds sooner rather than later, as Joy Wiltermuth explains.</p><p>Has the bear market in stocks ended?</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 3.8% during the first two trading sessions this week and then pulled back 1.6% over the following two days.

Millions of people who locked in fixed rates over the past several years through early 2022 might feel good about their decisions, as long as they are not forced to move.</p><p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan in the U.S. rose to 6.94% as of Oct. 20 from 3.09% a year ago, according to Freddie Mac. Applications for adjustable-rate loans, which at least offer hope of lower payments when interest rates eventually fall, have hit their highest level since 2008.</p><p>More on housing:</p><p>* Home builders sentiment index falls for record tenth month in a row in October.
