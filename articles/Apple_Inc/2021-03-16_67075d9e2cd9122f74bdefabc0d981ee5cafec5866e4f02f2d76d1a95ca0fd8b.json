  "text": "<p>Foxconn is considering making electric vehicles in its plant in Wisconsin as soon as 2023, as the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer seeks to reduce its dependence on Apple.</p> <p>The company, which is pushing into the electric vehicle market as its profits from smartphones decline, will decide before July whether to base its EV manufacturing in Wisconsin or Mexico, said Young Liu, Foxconn chairman, to reporters in Taipei on Tuesday. </p> <p>The plant would be Foxconn's first to manufacture electric vehicles, as the company increases a push that began late last year with its creation of an open platform for the design of electric vehicles.</p> <p>If the Taiwanese group chooses Wisconsin, its push into EVs could help revive the local economy — hopes that were dashed when Foxconn failed to live up to a promise, made by its founder Terry Gou to then President Donald Trump in 2017, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e1ef9c4-7224-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c\">invest $10bn in an LCD flat panel plant</a> there.</p> <p>Gou's high-profile commitment was touted by the White House back then as proof that Trump was bringing manufacturing back to the US. But public sentiment in the US soon soured when Foxconn ditched its LCD production plans and failed to hire more than 10,000 people as promised.</p> <p>Now, the company is producing servers at the facility and has identified electric vehicles as another product suitable for the location, Liu said.</p> <p>Most contract manufacturers have moved server production from factories in China to plants in Taiwan, Mexico and the US in response to security <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40ebd786-a576-4dc2-ad38-b97f796b72a0\">concerns </a>from their customers. Two people familiar with the situation said Foxconn was making servers for Google in Wisconsin.</p> <p>But electric vehicles are Foxconn's main <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/149bc9a2-64de-4820-b002-4ded8f2d6ae4\">bet </a>in its attempt to become less dependent on Apple, which accounts for about half of its revenues, and less dependent on the large-volume, low-margin assembly of smartphones.</p> <p>Foxconn aims to capture 10 per cent of global EV production between 2025 and 2027. Last month, it announced a deal under which it is to manufacture electric vehicles designed by US start-up Fisker. Wisconsin or Mexico would be the location for that production. In January, it announced it would make electric vehicles with Chinese start-up Byton, and it is also negotiating a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler — a deal that has been delayed by the European carmaker's tie-up with PSA.</p> <p>Liu said that China, Europe and the US would all be important EV markets. He said that electric vehicles would be a good fit for the Wisconsin plant because it is close to the end market and close to a region with a history in car production.</p> <p>“We are not actually waiting to have a better deal,” Liu said, commenting on subsidies the Wisconsin state government is expected to hand out to the company. “We have to make sure that the product fits there and the customer likes there.” </p> <p>In the end, the availability and affordability of skilled labour and engineering talent would be the key factors in deciding between Wisconsin and Mexico, where Foxconn also has an existing plant, he added.</p> <p>Liu said the global car chip shortage was an opportunity for Foxconn to break into the car production supply chain. Carmakers' reaction to the wild swings in demand during the pandemic “was not fast enough due to [the] structure of the supply chain management”, with various tiers of suppliers, he said. </p> <p>“That gives us an advantage. When we deal with the supply chains, we do vertical integration. In the past they say, no, the tier 1 will handle it for us. Now, maybe they will reconsider. We would like to bring this change to the auto industry.”</p><p>Source: Kathrin Hille in Taipei 2021 'Foxconn weighs up making electric vehicles in Wisconsin from 2023' FT.com 16 March.
