  "text": "<p>(Hulu)</p><p>Growing up in a Native-American community in small-town Oklahoma, Sterlin Harjo spent a lot of time in the kitchen listening to his family tell stories over cups of coffee. The stories were simple and blended the minutiae of daily life with myths of the region. He drank it up.</p><p>\"In all of my work, I've tried to emulate how they spoke and how they told stories,\" he says. \"They could tell a story about going to the store and make it interesting. It was about the way they tell that story and the meaning that they inject into it that is really beautiful.\"</p><p>\"Reservation Dogs,\" which Mr. Harjo created with \"Jojo Rabbit\" director Taika Waititi, tells the story of everyday life among a group of Native-American friends growing up in a small town in rural Oklahoma, who are itching to get out and get to California. The dramedy is infused with the types of stories Mr. Harjo heard as a kid -- like a myth about a Deer Lady. The series premiered this week on Hulu (as part of its FX on Hulu programming).</p><p>\"Hollywood has always told the sad stories about us, 'cause they don't know how to tell anything else,\" he says. \"Nothing really reflected the humor we grew up in. I think that our humor is part of how we survived as a people.\"</p><p>New Release: 'CODA'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>Emilia Jones says it isn't uncommon to learn a new skill for an acting job. For \"CODA\" there were three: She had to learn how to sing, she had to learn to fish, and she had to learn American Sign Language.</p><p>\"I'd never learned sign language before. I'd never stepped on a fishing boat before. I sing all the time around the house, but I'd never had a singing lesson,\" she says. \"When I read the script, I thought, okay, if I was to do this film, it would be the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And that really excited me.\"</p><p>\"CODA\" -- an acronym for child of deaf adults -- had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where it sold to Apple for a reported record-breaking price of $25 million. It is in theaters and begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>New Release: 'Untold'</p><p>(Netflix)</p><p>This new five-part, sports documentary anthology was created by Chapman and Maclain Way, creators of Netflix's wildly popular documentary \"Wild Wild Country,\" about the Rajneeshpuram community in Oregon.</p><p>The anthology's first installment, \"Malice at the Palace,\" released this week, is about the brawl between players and fans at the Detroit Pistons-Indiana Pacers basketball game in 2004. It's followed by \"Deal with the Devil\" (Aug. 17), about the turbulent life of boxer Christy Martin. \"Caitlyn Jenner\" (Aug. 24) tracks the athlete's gold medal win in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics and its effect on her life in later years. \"Crime &amp; Penalties\" (Aug. 31) is about a mob-connected family that buys a minor league hockey team. \"Breaking Point\" (Sept. 7) examines tennis player Mardy Fish's struggles with anxiety.</p><p>Chapman Way says their next project evolved into a sports anthology -- with different directors brought in for several installments -- because they'd always wanted to unpack the story of Mr. Fish, whose struggles forced him to stop playing on tour.</p><p>\"It was a story that I had always felt makes for such a powerful sports documentary,\" Mr. Way says.</p>",
