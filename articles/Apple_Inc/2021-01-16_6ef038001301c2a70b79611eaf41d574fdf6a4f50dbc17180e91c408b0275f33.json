  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Amazon Sued Over E-Books  ----  By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg and Dana Mattioli",
  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc., which originally came up with the idea of charging bargain-basement prices for electronic books, is now being accused of forcing customers on other book sites to pay too much for them. </p><p>   A lawsuit filed Thursday in a federal district court in New York alleges that a deal between Amazon and five major book publishers has led to higher e-book prices for all consumers, because it prevents rival retailers from selling any of these publishers' e-books at a lower price than on Amazon. </p><p>   The suit, which was filed by the law firm Hagens Berman and is seeking class-action status, said Amazon charges high commissions and other costs to publishers, \"which in turn significantly increases the retail price of the e-books they sell on Amazon.com.\" As a result of the deal with the five big publishers, the price they charge on Amazon also has to be the price they charge everywhere else. </p><p>   Calling it a \"conspiracy to fix the retail price of e-books,\" the suit alleges that the deal between Amazon and the five publishers -- which it said account for 80% of all books sold in the U.S. -- violates antitrust law. </p><p>   \"If you are Barnes &amp; Noble and your stores are in trouble and your Nook device didn't go as far as you'd have liked, you would have liked to be able to say that your digital books are 10% cheaper than on Amazon,\" said Gregory Arenson, an antitrust lawyer and partner at Kaplan Fox &amp; Kilsheimer LLP. </p><p>   The five publishers cited in the lawsuit are HarperCollins Publishers, which like The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp; Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group; Penguin Random House, a unit of closely held German media company Bertelsmann SE; Simon &amp; Schuster, the book publishing arm of ViacomCBS Inc., and Macmillan. Penguin Random House has agreed to acquire Simon &amp; Schuster, pending regulatory approval. </p><p>   Amazon and all five publishers declined to comment. Barnes &amp; Noble didn't have an immediate comment. </p><p>   Under current U.S. antitrust law, a company typically isn't viewed as being anticompetitive if customers aren't harmed by the company's actions. One of the major ways customer harm is determined is if a company agrees with others to increase prices above the level at which they otherwise would have been. </p><p>   Amazon is the dominant U.S. e-book retailer, accounting for 76% of digital books sold in the U.S. in September, according to Codex Group LLC, a book-audience research firm. Rival sellers of digital books include Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Barnes &amp; Noble, which is owned by hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. </p><p>   The suit challenges the notion that Amazon has been a force for lower e-book prices. Amazon kick-started the business when it introduced its Kindle e-reader in November 2007, a launch that promoted digital bestsellers for $9.99. </p><p></p>",
