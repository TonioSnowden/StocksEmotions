  "text": "<p>I agree with most of Yuan Yang's comment piece (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fd310a3-cc3f-422a-960c-6a2b63d144dd\">November 29</a>) on the protests in China. However, “urban elites” is too vague a concept to include in “the broad coalition” she says is taking part. I think Yang meant college-educated young workers in the service sector or students still in universities. They face stiff competition and have no real prospect of accumulating capital and thus feel they have nothing to lose. </p> <p>The real elites — the well-to-do people in their forties and fifties — will surely have more reservations. They are connected to the state one way or another: they are more likely working for the government or a state-owned enterprise, which is expanding at the expense of the private sector. They also have kids in schools, which, in all likelihood, are state-funded. </p> <p>The real danger is students combine with blue-collar workers in a replay of the Communist party's own revolution script. As we've seen in Zhengzhou where Apple factory workers have clashed with police, those with nothing to lose but their chains present government a particular challenge.</p> <p><strong>Zhao Xiaoou</strong> <br><em>Montmagny, France</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Danger for CCP is replay of its own revolution script' FT.com 30 November.
