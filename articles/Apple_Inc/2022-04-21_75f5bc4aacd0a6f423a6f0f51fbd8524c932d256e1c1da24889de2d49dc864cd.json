Join the conversation below.</p><p>Even nut eaters might make space in the pantry for some of these nut-free alternatives, to expand their options for anchoring a sandwich or enriching a smoothie. I tasted my way through the category and the four nut-free butters below stood out for their versatility in the kitchen as well as their spoon appeal, straight from the jar.</p><p>Real Smooth</p><p>Best nut-free spreads to buy now </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>For the Chef</p><p>Tahini can bring a rich flavor and consistency to so much more than hummus. It's a handy swap for peanut butter on a sandwich, for starters, and the three sisters who founded Soom Foods aim to make it your secret weapon in both sweet and savory recipes. With its creamy texture and high fat content, tahini can stand in for milk, eggs or butter in cooking and baking. Soom's high-quality version comes in four flavors: Original, Vanilla Bean, Chocolate and Dark Chocolate With Sea Salt. The last was my favorite: The sea salt lingers on the palate, throwing the sweetness into relief. It's now my go-to ice cream topping. $26 for a three pack, SoomFoods.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>For the Sweet Tooth</p><p>Chickpeas have become a popular option as a healthful base for cookie dough and other treats, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to find chickpeas as the starring ingredient in a sweet jarred spread. Thanks to powdered sugar in the mix, Banzo Butter, made in Columbus, Ohio, tastes the most dessert-like of the brands featured here, reminiscent of cupcake frosting but with a lot less added sugar (between less than 1 and 3 grams per serving). Flavors include Chocolate, Strawberry, Pumpkin Spice and Mint Chocolate Chip, sold in 3-ounce jars, though founder Amy Andes said she hopes, eventually, to sell them in larger ones. $16 for a 3-pack, BanzoButterBrand.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>For the Allergy-Aware</p><p>Oat Haus co-founder and CEO Ali Bonar cites her own issues digesting nuts and a commitment to \"have fun with food\" as the impetus for coming up with a nut-free granola butter. Billed on the label as \"the world's first oat-based spread,\" this allergy-conscious brand is made in a nut-free facility near Philadelphia, minus the top eight allergens, including soy, milk and eggs. The spread comes in six core flavors—the latest, Birthday Cake, just launched—plus seasonal additions such as Pumpkin Spice. A dash of cinnamon takes the Original in an oatmeal-cookie direction, and tangy-sweet Strawberry Shortcake packed the most flavor. $13 per jar or $56 for six, Oat.Haus </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>For the Fruit Lover</p><p>Former \"Shark Tank\" contestant Melissa Bartow started making date butter in her New York University dorm in 2018, simply to satisfy her own sugar cravings. Now she sells her Wanna Date? spreads in more than 100 stores nationwide, on Amazon and via her website. The Original flavor contains just three ingredients: dates, water and lactic acid, while the Vanilla, Chocolate, Cookie and Cinnamon varieties incorporate spices and other natural flavors. The slightly grainy consistency called to mind apple butter. I combined it with the other spreads here to make a grown-up PB&amp;J. $12 per 10.5-ounce jar, EatWannaDate.com</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
