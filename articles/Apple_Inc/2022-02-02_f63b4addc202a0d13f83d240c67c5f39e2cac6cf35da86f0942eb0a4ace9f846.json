  "title": "Neil Young, Joe Rogan Podcast and Spotify: What to Know; As the podcaster responds to controversy, here's what to know about tensions surrounding his show",
  "text": "<p>The controversy began when Mr. Young, a 76-year-old folk-rock star whose hits including \"Heart of Gold\" and \"Harvest Moon\" have gained hundreds of millions of plays on Spotify, demanded that Spotify remove his music over what he says is vaccine misinformation spread by Mr. Rogan on the streaming service.</p><p>Mr. Young published an open letter in which he cited a podcast episode that featured Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines but who is now critical of them. Among the claims made in the episode was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19.</p><p>Spotify responded to Mr. Young's wishes by removing his music, the company confirmed on Jan. 26, after Mr. Young's record label, Warner Music Group Corp.'s Warner Records, formally requested Spotify remove the music.</p><p>Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek in a blog post on Jan. 30 said there are opinions on both sides of any issue and that he personally disagrees with plenty of individuals and views on Spotify.</p><p>\"To our very core, we believe that listening is everything,\" he said.</p><p>Spotify said that it had signed Mr. Rogan to a deal in May 2020, which The Wall Street Journal reported was worth more than $100 million. There have been tensions around Spotify and the podcaster internally at the company. The Journal reported in October of that year that a thread in Spotify's employee #ethics-club Slack channel centered on Mr. Rogan's episode with Alex Jones, a radio host and the publisher of InfoWars, whose content has been removed from Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify. Employees circulated information on how to flag content for review by Spotify's trust-and-safety team, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. Ek, responding to the 2020 controversy, shared his desire to make Spotify the largest audio platform in the world and said that ambition involves embracing diverse voices and differing opinions as the company chases scale in podcasting.</p><p>Mr. Ek, at that time, said that applying the rules consistently is his priority.</p><p>Who is Joe Rogan?</p><p>Mr. Rogan is a comedian and former mixed-martial-arts commentator who has built up his hit podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" currently Spotify's most popular podcast .</p><p>What did Joe Rogan say in response to the latest controversy?</p><p>In a 10-minute Instagram video post late Sunday, Mr. Rogan said, \"If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,\" referring to the growing backlash against him and Spotify.</p><p>\"It's a strange responsibility to have this many viewers and listeners,\" Mr. Rogan said. \"It's nothing that I've prepared for. I'm going to do my best to balance things out.\"</p><p>Mr. Rogan said he would have more guests on the show that present different opinions from contrarian ones right after he hosts controversial guests. He thanked Spotify for supporting him and said he is a huge Neil Young fan.</p><p>Is anyone else pulling out of Spotify as a result?</p><p>Musicians David Crosby and Stephen Stills are joining their former bandmate Mr. Young in his protest against Spotify, saying they want to pull their music from the platform. \"We support Neil and we agree with him that there is dangerous disinformation being aired on Spotify's Joe Rogan podcast,\" Messrs. Crosby and Stills said in a statement on Feb. 2 that also was signed by Graham Nash, another former bandmate. Mr. Nash earlier announced plans to pull his music from Spotify. Musicians Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren and India Arie also have sought to remove their music in the past week. Mary Trump, the author and niece of former President Donald Trump, and writer Roxane Gay said they were removing their podcasts from the platform.</p><p>What has Neil Young said since Spotify removed his albums?</p><p>Mr. Young has directed his fans to use other streaming services including Amazon Music, Apple Music and Qobuz to stream his songs.</p><p>In a post on Twitter, Mr. Young provided a link where new subscribers signing up for Amazon.com Inc.'s streaming-music service can receive four months free and then pay $7.99 a month afterward.</p><p>How much is Joe Rogan making with Spotify?</p><p>Spotify struck a licensing deal with Mr. Rogan in 2020 worth more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>What action has Spotify taken to prevent misinformation on its platform?</p><p>As of Jan. 30, Spotify is beginning to tag Covid-19-related content with an advisory prompting users to check out the service's new \"hub for data-driven facts and up-to-date information\" from the health and scientific communities. \"We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,\" said Mr. Ek in a blog postthat day. \"It's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time.\"</p><p>Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Journal, has a content partnership with Gimlet Media, a unit of Spotify.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Neil Young, Joe Rogan Podcast and Spotify: What to Know</p>",
