  "title": "Tiffany Haddish Reveals Her Secret Calendar Productivity Hack; The actor and comedian also discusses her new children's book and writing a diary in the sauna",
  "text": "<p>For the most part, Haddish, 42, doesn't need a lot of sleep to do it. Recently, the actor and comedian, who sometimes journals into the wee hours, has only been getting three or four hours per night. Sometimes, it catches up to her: \"I went to a conference and I was dozing off in the dang conference,\" she says.</p><p>This month, Haddish also released her children's book, Layla the Last Black Unicorn, about a unicorn who wants to fit in at school, eventually realizing she shouldn't try to hide her own uniqueness. (Haddish's 2017 memoir was titled The Last Black Unicorn.) \"The sooner you learn how to accept who you are for what you are and be proud of your differences, the sooner you'll be able to function in society,\" says Haddish. \"I think the kids need to learn about that as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Haddish starred in this year's Apple TV+ series The Afterparty, which was recently renewed for a second season, as well as the Nicolas Cage comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Here, she speaks to WSJ. about journaling in her portable sauna and why she'd make an excellent detective.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>It depends on what time I went to bed on Sunday, but normally I wake up at about 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning, and I stretch—when I say stretch, I mean I reach my arms up—and I pick up my telephone. And I put it on Do Not Disturb, and then I turn on my little meditation music. I sit there for probably about five, 10 minutes. Go use the restroom, brush my teeth, wash my body off and find some food.</p><p>Do you have a go-to breakfast?</p><p>It depends on what I ate last night, because I might eat leftovers, I might make some eggs. I might just decide I'm going to drink a gallon of water and then I get to eat, which usually turns out being like one liter of water.</p><p>And this is on a day that I don't have to go to work, right? Because if I have to go to work, then I'm just going to send a text message to the AD [assistant director] with what I want to eat and that'll be there for me when I get to work.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>Yes, I definitely take vitamins. Vitamin C, Vitafusion multi gummy vitamins for women and Vitamin D. I like the chewies. [Editor's note: Haddish is a brand ambassador for Vitafusion.]</p><p>Are you a coffee or tea drinker?</p><p>No, I might drink some chamomile tea at night, but in the mornings, no. Unless I'm feeling a little congested, then I might make a lemon tea.</p><p>Is there a time of the day or week when you're most creative?</p><p>[Lowers voice] Everyday, darling. And anytime I'm awake, I'm creating something.</p><p>Sorry I got dramatic on you there, but that's true.</p><p>I'm jealous. What's your exercise routine like?</p><p>Well, I like to jog. I'll do that probably twice a week. And then dancing, a lot of dance, that's usually at night time. And then I'll do some stretching, like I said. That's really important. I probably work out three times a week. And I love, love, love to sit in my little portable sauna when I'm doing my little notes and stuff, when I journal.</p><p>When do you tend to journal?</p><p>I journal before I go to bed, which is sometimes the problem with me sleeping for so few hours, because I'll be writing so much. Sometimes it's what happened during the day, sometimes it's an idea I have, sometimes it's me plotting and planning, calendaring. Strategizing.</p><p>It's funny, I have a calendar that most of the people on my team can see, and then I have my calendar that only I can see. You know what? That's what makes me feel productive, when I see everything done on the calendar.</p><p>What's on your secret calendar?</p><p>You said the key word. It's a secret, darling, that's why it's a secret calendar.</p><p>What about your beauty routine, what's that like?</p><p>I wash my face in the morning. I use coconut oil on my skin and wash that off with some gentle soap, not necessarily a brand of any sort. Then I go ahead and put a little bit of moisturizer on my face and then I'm good to go, a little bit of sunscreen. I like using the Tatcha sunscreen with moisturizer. Then, that's it. I might glue on some lashes depending on what I've got going on for the work day. Most of the time somebody else is doing my makeup. And if I don't have to wear makeup, I won't. I'll play with filters.</p><p>Congratulations on Layla the Last Black Unicorn —how'd you come up with the character of Layla and bring her to life?</p><p>When I was a kid, people used to call me \"dark unicorn,\" and I love unicorns, so I was like, oh why not make her a Black unicorn? And Layla means \"dark and beautiful night,\" so I like that name. And I love her curly hair.</p><p>The Afterparty was recently renewed for a second season—do you think you'd be a good detective in real life?</p><p>I'd be an excellent detective, darling. I'm a woman.</p><p>Do you think there's anything comedians shouldn't joke about?</p><p>I think you can joke about anything, it just depends on where you're coming from and the circumstances. And know your audience. It's really important to know your audience and know where you are.</p><p>Do you have a dream character you'd like to play that you haven't yet?</p><p>Flojo.</p><p>What makes you feel the most productive?</p><p>When I check my bank account.</p><p>What have you been reading and watching lately?</p><p>I've been watching cartoons. And I've been reading about taxes and nationalism, what is that really, patriotism, all kinds of stuff like that, all of the -isms.</p><p>What do you for self-care and to relax?</p><p>I love painting and gardening and I like going on hikes. I don't really count that as working out, though. And then if I'm just in the bed and I'm having a hard time falling asleep, I'll turn on some cartoons. Cartoons usually do it for me.</p><p>What have you been painting lately?</p><p>I painted some piano keys on a canvas.</p><p>What's one piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>Do something every single day towards your goal, do at least one thing a day towards your big goal. And you'll accomplish it. And that has been my guiding light.</p><p>Can I ask what your big goal is right now that you're working towards?</p><p>No, that's on my secret calendar.</p><p>Got it, fair.</p><p>Okay, I'll tell you. My big goal is to open an amusement park.</p><p>That's amazing.</p><p>You're like, \"Yeah, sure, whatever.\" When I do it, you're going to be the first one to get a ticket to go, because you don't believe me.</p><p>No, I believe you!</p><p>If Dolly Parton can do it, Tiffany Haddish can do it. Every amusement park is attached to a major motion studio. Except for Dollywood, because she has her own studios. When you get enough intellectual property, you can make the rides based off that, i.e. 50 movies.</p><p>I'm excited to go someday.</p><p>Um-hum, you will.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Tiffany Haddish Reveals Her Secret Calendar Productivity Hack</p>",
