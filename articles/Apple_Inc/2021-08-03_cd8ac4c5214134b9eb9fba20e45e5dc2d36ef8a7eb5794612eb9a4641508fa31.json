  "title": "More Workers on Edge About Return to Office As Delta Variant Rises",
  "text": "<p>With scores of U.S. companies planning to return to offices in full force in a few weeks, workers are trying to make sense of changing face-mask guidelines and rising virus cases, along with new research about how easily the virus strain can be transmitted. The calculations and recalculations of risk are leaving many stressed, upset or simply in limbo.</p><p>New and at times confusing guidance from health officials and employers on wearing masks indoors, and questions about whether vaccines will be required or not, have workers grappling with what to expect at work, or even whether to come in.</p><p>Though many workers posting on social media seem divided on vaccine mandates, plenty agree that wearing a mask at the office all day can feel pointless. \"I'm in phone sales, you can't talk on the phone all day, eight hours a day with a mask on,\" Mr. Wingelaar said. \"I'm probably just going to be wearing the mask in the elevator.\"</p><p>Health and safety worries are clouding some workers' enthusiasm for getting back to workplace routines. In a Glassdoor survey of more than 1,000 working adults conducted by the Harris Poll in early July, 35% said they were concerned about contracting Covid-19 when returning to the office. About two-thirds said they were still eager to return, down from an April survey in which nearly three-quarters of people polled said they wanted to go back to an office at least part time.</p><p>As more public and private-sector companies and the federal government begin requiring vaccinations or weekly Covid-19 testing, some workers are expressing relief over their employers' mandates. Others are adamantly opposed, and unions split over the issue last week, with several speaking out against vaccine mandates.</p><p>Nearly as fraught is the issue of face masks at work. Some vaccinated employees say they are unhappy about having to wear masks at work as a result of the CDC's recent reversal on mask-wearing indoors.</p><p>A string of high-profile companies, particularly in technology, including Apple Inc. and Google, are postponing office-reopening dates or closing campuses again after briefly reopening them in recent weeks.</p><p>Max Andre was thrilled to be back at the office in June after working from home since April 2020. \"It felt good, the camaraderie of being with your peers, and there's nothing like giving one of your staff members a fist bump on a great job,\" said the 51-year-old, who is a team leader with a healthcare insurance company and lives in Coral Springs, Fla.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Andre went back to working from home because of concerns about the Delta variant.</p><p>\"I was really looking forward to being back in the building, having interaction with someone besides my wife and kids, and now I'm going back to the house again,\" he said. \"It's tiring.\"</p><p>Tera Martin-Roy, a 39-year-old staff member in the economics department at the University of Illinois, said she has no problem wearing masks at work to keep others safe. The university said last week it would require people to wear a mask in all its buildings regardless of their vaccination status; previously, vaccinated individuals could roam without one.</p><p>Still, the unending conversation about masks, both at work and from health officials, is exhausting, she said.</p><p>\"I'm emotionally drained,\" she said. \"There is so much talk about it every day at work.\"</p>",
