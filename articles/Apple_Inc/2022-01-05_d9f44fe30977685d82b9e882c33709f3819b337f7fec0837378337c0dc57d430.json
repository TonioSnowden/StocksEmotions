  "title": "Sony To Make And Sell Own EVs",
  "text": "<p>Sony first displayed an EV sedan at CES two years ago but said at the time it didn't necessarily plan to sell a Sony car. The initial prototype served to show off Sony's image sensors, which can be an important part of autonomous driving systems.</p><p>The new Las Vegas announcement suggested Sony does plan to sell vehicles under its own brand rather than merely supplying its technology to other car makers. The company said it would establish a company called Sony Mobility Inc. in the spring.</p><p>The EV market is getting more crowded with Tesla Inc. leading the pack of EV-only companies competing against traditional car makers, almost all of which have announced ambitious plans to expand their EV offerings.</p><p>In an interview in September 2020, Sony Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida expressed strong interest in getting into the vehicle market.</p><p>He said he had felt for years that the maker of PlayStation videogame consoles and other electronics should \"make something that moves.\"</p><p>Electric vehicles have fewer moving parts than those running on gasoline and rely more on software controls, making it easier for companies that specialize in electronics to get into the business.</p><p>Apple Inc. has explored entering the EV market for years, although it has never released details about its plans.</p><p>Sony is a major Apple supplier because of its image-sensing business, which makes parts used in iPhones and other smartphones.</p><p>Sony said 40 sensors were installed in its prototype. It said it eventually aimed to offer what is known as level four autonomous driving, in which the car can drive itself without human involvement under certain conditions.</p><p>Another Apple partner, contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, is also making a foray into EVs. Foxconn, known for assembling Apple's iPhones and other branded tech devices, introduced three electric-vehicle prototypes last October.</p><p>Foxconn Chairman Young Liu has said the company aims to supply three million electric vehicles annually by 2027, which he estimated would be about 10% of the global market then.</p><p>---</p><p>Yang Jie contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
