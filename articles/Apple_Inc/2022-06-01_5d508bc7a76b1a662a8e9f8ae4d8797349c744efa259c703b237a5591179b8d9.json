  "title": "China loosens Shanghai restrictions as economic woes mount",
  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Shanghai's shops welcomed city residents back today after a gruelling two-month lockdown that had confined 25mn people to their homes in one of the strictest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/808738dc-b8ea-4da5-b41f-9570c35c36a4\">anti-Covid lockdowns</a> in China since the pandemic began.</p> <p>Policymakers will be hoping that the (still partial) reopening of stores and public transport in China's biggest city and financial centre can help address the sharp <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/china-covid-economy/\">slowdown in growth</a> fuelled by the country's zero-Covid strategy of mass testing, harsh lockdowns, travel bans and forced quarantine.</p> <p>The damage has been widespread, from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41f80bad-0eca-445a-a7fb-922262611311\">retail sales</a>, which were down 11 per cent in April, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-854a4e0a-6789-4782-a2ac-ce22da70cec0\">manufacturing</a>, which shrank for the third month in a row in May, according to new survey data out this morning. Fresh restrictions announced today in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-4edd5662-2bbe-4c71-85d3-08d8724bc019\">Hong Kong</a> are a reminder that the virus is still far from done.</p> <p>During the pandemic peak periods of 2020 and 2021, Chinese manufacturing benefited from surging demand for computing and domestic tech. However, as economies reopened the emphasis shifted to services, denting demand for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10784d1b-9fad-4426-91c0-8a1f0868e46d\">Chinese exports</a>, which grew just 3.9 per cent in April, the slowest rate since July 2020. Rising inflation, fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, makes a repeat of the previous export-led recovery, supported by domestic consumption, even less likely. The country also remains mired in a property sector crisis.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10140356.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>As our colleagues at <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Apple-to-shift-iPad-capacity-to-Vietnam-amid-China-supply-chain-woes\">Nikkei Asia</a> report today, big name manufacturers such as Apple are starting to move some of their production out of China after the strict lockdowns in and around Shanghai dented supply chains.</p> <p>The country's leaders have acknowledged that it will struggle to record positive growth in the current quarter and potentially fall short of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14f6651f-b727-45e5-8370-7dfb245381a7\">annual target</a> of 5.5 per cent as it continues to battle coronavirus outbreaks. President Xi Jinping could even become the first Chinese leader in almost 50 years to see growth fall behind that of the US.</p> <p>The slowdown also has serious implications beyond China's borders. As our excellent <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/china-covid-economy/\">visual representation</a> of the country's woes explains, its economy had been expected to continue to drive about one-fifth of all global GDP growth until at least 2026.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f71be63a-54fc-447a-9033-a3d23333ca59\">FT editorial board</a> says the deteriorating outlook could provide an opportunity for Beijing to not only reconsider aspects of zero-Covid, but also its treatment of foreign direct investors, many of whom are planning to pivot away from the country.</p> <p>A focus on reducing red tape and ensuring equal treatment with local competitors could help alleviate some of the gloom, it adds. “What is good for them is good for China's own economy.”</p> <p><em>Disrupted Times will take a short holiday break on Friday and return on Monday June 6</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Delta expects <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-2053dc33-b315-4e4c-90f4-d7f43ee222b7\">second-quarter revenue</a> to hit pre-pandemic levels </p></li>  <li><p>Boris Johnson says it would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-9e8fa63a-a4a6-4318-ba19-5df0a9c1bfce\">“irresponsible” to quit</a> as UK prime minister</p></li>  <li><p>Versace and Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-19404dd0-1770-4086-b12c-89bebcd3743a\">pushes up profit forecast</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Eurozone unemployment</strong> remained at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83c57fca-e476-4486-9679-f4f9a09c0e44#post-fc50ba2b-2a83-4f26-b189-c0dfeb49d87c\">record low</a> of 6.8 per cent in April, official data showed today, with the relative strength of the labour market a key item on the European Central Bank's agenda when it meets to discuss monetary policy next week. The news follows record <strong>inflation</strong> figures published yesterday of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea6597bf-9bcd-414a-959c-6806f7c65fab\">8.1 per cent</a> in the year to May.

Unhedged writer Robert Armstrong contrasts Europe's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c83ec74-6748-41fb-8980-baa89dbcec1d\">cost-push inflation</a> with demand-pull in the US.</p> <p><strong>Crude oil</strong> prices yesterday breached the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/792171d7-ae3c-469c-bac6-295fd217bd57\">$120 mark</a> thanks to increased global demand and disruption of supplies from Russia. EU leaders agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/065d9946-b762-448b-9ab4-f1f213896d4a\">stop most imports</a>, while Russian oil cargoes were also hit by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10372dd3-be3c-42b9-982b-241a38efcc88\">insurance ban</a>. Here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e62a1ef1-22d9-4591-bda4-0a0d5e5f6c15\">explainer</a> on what the measures mean for global markets.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>Wall Street banks warned of the “grim outlook” for <strong>the pound </strong>as high inflation and an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a3327bd-b6dc-41e9-8a64-1ad82802d5da\">economic slowdown</a> lead to further declines for the UK currency.

Even the seemingly unstoppable rise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/096ae78e-618d-4443-b8d9-5dd5a56db389\">house prices</a> seems to be cooling a little.</p> <p>Disrupted times could well be the new slogan for <strong>UK airports. </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5185a802-824c-4c98-a691-8fae048a18b7\">Staff shortages</a> have led to travel chaos, just as the country's busiest week for flying since the start of the pandemic gets under way with the school half-term break and a two-day public holiday for the Queen's platinum jubilee.

Unemployment has remained steady and inflation has begun to slow.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>US Treasury secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> admitted she was “wrong” last year about the threat of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/437a4e4b-9b97-4cd0-bb4a-d5d333e65410\">rising inflation</a>. US president Joe Biden told Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell that he would respect the “independence” of the central bank as it begins to tighten monetary policy and ramp up interest rates.
