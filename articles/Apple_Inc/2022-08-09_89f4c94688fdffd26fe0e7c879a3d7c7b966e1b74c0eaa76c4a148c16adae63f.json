  "text": "<p>Mr. Miyake's fashion empire spanned the globe, and his work embraced both traditional design and cutting-edge technologies.</p><p>He started experimenting with his pleating technique in 1988 and introduced his Pleats Please line in 1993, according to Miyake Design Studio.</p><p>The clothes are made from a single piece of fabric with a heat treatment system to maintain their accordionlike structure. Made solely from polyester, the threads are manufactured in Shizuoka, Japan, and then woven into knit fabric in Toyama.</p><p>The material looked like meticulously folded paper and boasted the comfort of sweatpants. It marked a new, mechanized way of producing shirts and trousers. In the 2016 monograph \"Issey Miyake,\" designer Kazuko Koike, who worked with Mr. Miyake, recalled him describing his new pleats: \"You know a bread-baking oven? Just like that, a blouse is baked. Like a loaf of bread!\"</p><p>The line found a new audience during the pandemic with people seeking comfort in smart outfits.</p><p>In 1992, drawing inspiration from a single drop of water, he designed a perfume bottle and a scent based on the fragrance of clean water called L'Eau D'Issey, in collaboration with Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido Co.</p><p>Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Mr. Miyake was seven years old during the atomic bombing of his hometown. He survived the attack, but his mother died of radiation exposure three years later. In a 2009 New York Times opinion piece, Mr. Miyake recalled the explosion. \"When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience: a bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape. I remember it all.\"</p><p>Mr. Miyake began designing clothes in the early 1960s for Toyo Rayon, a Tokyo based corporation that was experimenting with neoteric synthetic fabrics—part of a progression in the fashion industry away from traditional cottons and wools. This helped spark a career-long interest in cutting-edge fabrics for Mr. Miyake.</p><p>At the time, he was studying graphic design at Tama Art University in Japan. \"[I] had not decided on what I wanted to do in the future, though I was vaguely interested in fashion,\" Mr. Miyake told Japanese magazine Geijutsu Shincho in 2000.</p><p>A stint studying in Paris and working under designers Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy solidified his interest in fashion. In 1970 he returned to Japan and launched his clothing label, the Issey Miyake Design Studio.</p><p>Mr. Miyake's designs were airy and arrived in optimistic primary colors. He often used dancers as models to highlight the clothing's pliability. In contrast to the precision of French haute couture, Mr. Miyake's creations were designed for everyday wear. His swinging skirts, roomy jackets with kimono sleeves and springy trousers were meant to move with the customer—not weigh them down.</p><p>One of his aims, he would say, was to create clothing for \"the many rather than for the few.\"</p><p>The approach won over a diverse array of fans from musician Miles Davis to comedian Robin Williams.</p><p>Other Obituaries</p><p>* CSX Railroad Chief Hays T. Watkins Promoted One-Stop Shipping</p><p>* Former Microsoft Executive Richard Tait Created Cranium Board Game</p><p>* Donald Jonas, Co-Founder of Lechters Housewares Chain, Funded Nursing Education</p><p>His most visible client was Steve Jobs, who in the early '80s cast aside preppy double-breasted blazers and ties in favor of Mr. Miyake's futuristic turtlenecks. Eventually, Mr. Jobs would own roughly 100 of the brand's spongy turtlenecks, according to Walter Isaacson's biography.</p><p>While Mr. Miyake stepped away from the brand he founded several years ago, his profile never faded. In 2016, the French government awarded him the prestigious Legion of Honor and today, his designs are in the collections at London's Victoria and Albert Museum and New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>He continued to work with avant-garde structures and introduced the playful Bao Bao bag in 2000, known for its geometric look made of triangular pieces.</p><p>Mr. Miyake's company said a funeral for the designer has been held and no memorial service is planned. It didn't disclose a list of survivors.</p><p>Write to Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com and Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Issey Miyake, Influential Japanese Fashion Designer, Dies at 84</p>",
