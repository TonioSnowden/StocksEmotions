  "text": "<p>Lizzo has been working on her new album, Special, which is set to be released on July 15, and features the new single \"About Damn Time.\" Six years ago, she thought of creating her own shapewear brand. In 2019, she started working with Fabletics on what would eventually become Yitty, a label created in partnership with the company, which debuted on April 12. The line offers underwear, leggings, bodysuits and other pieces in both bright colors and skin tones in a 6X–XS size range. Prices, which range from $20 to $90, are reduced significantly for those who purchase a monthly membership ($50).</p><p>\"I want to celebrate all of the different beautiful kinds of shaped bodies because it's not just hourglass, and that shouldn't be the only desired body type,\" says Lizzo. \"There's apple, there's triangle, upside down triangle, there's circle. There's slim girls with no booty. They're beautiful too, and they deserve to honor that shape and celebrate that shape and accentuate it if they want.\"</p><p>Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, was born and raised in Detroit before moving to Houston at age 10. She began her music career in Minneapolis, creating two studio albums before rising to fame with 2019's Cuz I Love You, which was nominated for eight Grammys and won three. She's a classically trained flutist who plays the instrument in many of her songs and is known for infusing hip-hop with other genres including soul, R&amp;B and funk-pop. Last month, Amazon Studios released Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls, a reality show about her search for backup dancers for her upcoming tour, on Prime Video.</p><p>Here, Lizzo discusses the beauty routine she \"forced\" on herself and the best advice Missy Elliott gave her.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays, and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>I'm not a late riser. Even if I'm hungover, I don't stay asleep past 8. Seven, 8, 9 a.m. is like my sweet spot. Mondays, let's say 8:30. The first thing I want to do is way different than the first thing I do. I just get up and have a little bit of gratitude: \"I'm very thankful for waking up.\" And then at my coolest, I would have crazy dreams or really intense or vivid dreams, and I'd write them down in my journal.</p><p>Are you one of those \"four hours a night is all I need\" people with sleep or do you need a minimum to recharge?</p><p>I can go off of fumes because of my rock background and just playing shows and staying up all night, going to the studio. Now that I'm trying to be a multi-empire mogul, I should get more rest. So I try to get like six hours.</p><p>Do you have a go-to breakfast?</p><p>Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I love a big, greasy, cheesy breakfast. But when I'm working, it doesn't happen that way. Lately I've just been getting berries in the morning, berries and yogurt and fruit.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>I do. I take vitamin D. I take a B, because vegans, we've got to get that B from somewhere. I take some woo-woo s— too, like colloidal silver.</p><p>What's your beauty routine like?</p><p>Well, I really wanted one, so I just started. I kind of forced one on myself, because I didn't have one. I was a \"put some soap on, wash your body\" type of person, but there's creams and oils and sprays and s— that people were giving to me and I was like, \"Oh, this is nice.\" I started using it. So I have a face wash and then I like to use a rosewater spray and then I'll do a vitamin C oil on my skin. And then on my best days, I gua sha [a Chinese medicine practice that involves facial massage with a jade stone]. I have wild sinus issues—I have a tiny nose and get a lot of congestion. So I'll gua sha and release a lot of that sinus pressure in my face. It really helps. And then I have Lucas' Papaw Ointment for my lips. For bed, it's just wash your makeup off and put a little oil on it. I'm pretty simple, though.</p><p>What do you do for exercise?</p><p>I work out. As you can see, I'm wearing my Fitbit right now. I try to get 10 to 12,000 steps a day. It's 3:35 p.m. and I'm at 6,323 and I have to go to a dance rehearsal after this, so I'm going to more than reach my goal. I work out three to four times a week with a personal trainer who's helping strengthen my back and my hips because I have a twerk injury that I'm trying to get over. Years of twerking have caught up to me. I've been doing it for a thousand years.</p><p>How do you want Yitty to change the conversation around people's bodies?</p><p>Back when I first was interested in doing shapewear about six years ago, I was concerned at how little options women specifically had for this kind of apparel. It's a unique kind of apparel because it's not quite underwear, it's not lingerie, it isn't an outfit. It's literally a piece of clothing you put somewhere in between. I thought it was bizarre that nobody has tapped into this category in fashion. Also, I hated this mentality of, \"You're not good enough.\" That's what shapewear kind of represented: \"I don't look good enough in this dress so now this girdle is going to change that and make me look good and make me good enough.\" I was like, \"Nah, we need to end that.\" We need to just create a product that is comfortable and doesn't breed shame, because there was a lot of shame with me wearing shapewear growing up.</p><p>Are you at all worried about going up against Skims?</p><p>Well, no, because I don't feel like I'm going up against anybody. I think that this market is wide open and there's room for everybody. It was a confirmation for me when Skims dropped because it was about a year after we started having shapewear conversations and I was like, \"I told you! I told you that this was a viable category in that somebody needs to come in and shake this industry up.\" I think that just put fire under people's asses. I was grateful for it because it validated what I was saying. I think there's room for both of us. What Skims does is different than what I do, and giving the power to the consumer is really what it's all about.</p><p>Did you learn anything new about yourself while you were writing the songs on your new album?</p><p>I never really know what my album's about until I look back on it and it's done. These songs are like lessons I'm going through. When I look back on the body of work, I'm going to be like, \"Ah, this is what that was about.\"</p><p>What have you been reading and watching lately?</p><p>I just finished this book called The Molecule of More [by Daniel Z. Lieberman and Michael E. Long]. I love books about psychology and why human beings are the way they are. It gave me insight on drive. It's all about dopamine and dopaminergic people. So now I'm reading a book called Sapiens [Yuval Noah Harari] that is about the beginning of human beings and where we're going to go as human beings.</p><p>I don't really watch too much TV or movies. I don't know why; I'm just not that girl. I have been watching this one show called Kotaro Lives Alone and it's about this little boy named Kotaro and he lives in this apartment complex by himself. He befriends all of his neighbors and they're like, \"How old are you?\" And he's like, \"I'm 4 years old.\" He's super mature for his age…. It's so cute and funny at first but then as the show goes on, these layers start to peel back and you find out why he lives alone and his life story. And it's actually very heartbreaking. I actually had to stop watching for a minute because I was like, \"This shit is sad now! Damn. I just wanted to watch something cute.\"</p><p>What's a piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>Missy Elliott gave me really great advice. A lot of really good advice, all the time, but namely when we were doing the \"Tempo\" music video. I just kept shrinking myself, literally, because she's 5'2\" and I'm 5'9\". She was like, \"Quit doing that. Don't ever shrink yourself on your set. This is your music video. You are the star. Whenever that shit is yours, don't ever make yourself smaller for other people.\" And I took that across the board. Don't shrink yourself in a literal way to make people comfortable, don't shrink yourself creatively. Don't limit yourself as a businesswoman. Don't shrink yourself when you're standing up for yourself in your personal life, in your relationships with people. And that was really helpful, because I'm such a socially conscious person. I'm always like, \"Is everybody OK?\" [Mock nervous laughter] Nah, I hope you're OK, but I want to make sure I'm OK too.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>How Lizzo Plans to Become a Mogul</p>",
