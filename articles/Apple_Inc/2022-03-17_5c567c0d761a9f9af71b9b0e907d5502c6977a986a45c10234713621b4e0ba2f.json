  "title": "Markets & Finance: Stock Pickers Watched S&P Pass Them by Again in 2021",
  "text": "<p>The failure of stock pickers to beat the benchmark is nothing new: 2021 was the 12th consecutive year in which the majority of actively managed funds of large-cap stocks watched the S&amp;P 500 pass them by.</p><p>But 2021's performance was particularly weak, with the smallest share of large-cap stock pickers beating the benchmark since 2014. During the market tumult of 2020, by comparison, 60% of U.S. large-cap funds lagged behind the benchmark index.</p><p>Stock pickers can try to beat their benchmarks by tilting their fund toward a part of the market that is outperforming, like shares of fast-growing companies and big tech stocks in 2020. That year, almost 64% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 was contributed by just five companies: Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp.</p><p>Last year, growth stocks recorded a smaller lead over value stocks than in 2020. The five highest-contributing companies accounted for about 31% of the index's 2021 return -- less than half that of the prior year. Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Nvidia repeated their stints on the top-five list and were joined by Tesla Inc.</p><p>The narrowing of performance gaps may be one reason that so many stock pickers failed to deliver stronger results than the broad market, said Craig Lazzara, managing director in core product management at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>\"The opportunity that you might have by moving to a more extreme growth posture or to a larger cap posture was much less in 2021 than it had been the prior year,\" he said.</p><p>The average return last year of large-cap U.S. funds, weighted by fund assets, was 23.3%, more than 5 percentage points lower than that of the S&amp;P 500, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
