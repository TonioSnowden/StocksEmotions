  "title": "NFL in Advanced Talks With Google's YouTube for 'Sunday Ticket' Rights Deal; Agreement on the subscription package for most Sunday afternoon football games could be reached as early as Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>Terms being discussed for the agreement couldn't immediately be learned. Satellite broadcaster DirecTV, which is co-owned by AT&amp;T Inc. and private-equity firm TPG Inc., currently pays $1.5 billion annually for Sunday Ticket rights, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Sunday Ticket allows subscribers to view all \"out of market\" Sunday afternoon games, meaning games that don't involve their local teams.</p><p>A potential move of Sunday Ticket to YouTube is further evidence of major sports migrating from traditional TV, which has been hit by cord-cutting, to streaming and tech companies that are willing to spend heavily on content. Amazon.com Inc. has its own NFL deal, while Apple Inc. streams some Major League Baseball games and has a new deal for Major League Soccer.</p><p>The addition of Sunday Ticket would provide a boost to YouTube's streaming efforts as the video platform attempts to broaden beyond advertising sales into subscription revenue.</p><p>Under the scenario being discussed, NFL games would be available to be streamed on two subscription services, YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels, next season. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc.</p><p>YouTube has recently grown into a popular destination for television watchers, overtaking Netflix Inc. as the most viewed streaming service on TV for the first time earlier this year, according to Nielsen data.</p><p>YouTube TV, a $64.99-per-month online bundle of cable channels, crossed more than 5 million subscriptions and trial accounts in June, according to the company. Primetime Channels, which launched in November, allows viewers to individually subscribe to more than 30 streaming services.</p><p>Sunday Ticket would be offered as an add-on to both services, the people familiar with the potential agreement said.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com and Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Updates to follow as news develops.</p><p>NFL in Advanced Talks With Google's YouTube for 'Sunday Ticket' Rights Deal</p>",
