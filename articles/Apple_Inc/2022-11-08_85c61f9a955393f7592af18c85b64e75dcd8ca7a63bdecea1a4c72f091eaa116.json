  "text": "<p>BRUSSELSâ€”The European Union's top court overturned a tax ruling against Fiat Chrysler from 2015, handing the bloc's regulators a fresh setback in a crackdown on multinational companies' efforts to financially shield their operations.</p><p>The setback follows similar reversals in tax cases involving Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Starbucks Corp.</p><p>Tuesday's ruling against the European Commission from the European Court of Justice, the bloc's highest court, overturns a 2019 ruling in the commission's favor from the EU's second-highest court, the General Court. That court had sided against the commission in the other three cases. The commission has appealed the Apple and Amazon rulings to the ECJ.</p><p>The ruling is a blow to Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, who is leading a campaign to curb alleged excesses by some of the world's largest tech companies. Ms. Vestager's tax cases were among her first big salvos against tech companies in her role running EU competition enforcement. She later fined Alphabet Inc.'s Google three times for alleged abuses of dominance. The company appealed those cases.</p><p>Ms. Vestager said the commission would study the judgment and its implications. \"The commission is committed to continue using all the tools at its disposal to ensure that fair competition is not distorted in the single market through the grant by member states of illegal tax breaks to multinational companies,\" she said.</p><p>Tax cases like those brought by the commission are one reason that almost 140 countries last year agreed to set a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. Implementation of that deal is bogged down in review and approval by the countries involved, including among the EU's 27 members.</p><p>The commission ruled in 2015 that Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis NV, had benefited from an illegal tax deal that was granted to the company in Luxembourg. The commission said at the time that the deal amounted to a state subsidy and ordered the Luxembourg government to recover the equivalent of about $30 million from the company.</p><p>The lower court's analysis of the case, \"and by extension, the existence of a selective advantage\" to Fiat Chrysler is erroneous, the Court of Justice said Tuesday.</p><p>EU Tax Ruling on Fiat-Chrysler Is Rejected by Court</p>",
