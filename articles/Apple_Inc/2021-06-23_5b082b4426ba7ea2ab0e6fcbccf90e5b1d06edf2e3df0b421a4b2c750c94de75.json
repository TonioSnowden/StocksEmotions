  "text": "<p>Frankly, the detective story suggested by the title of the documentary <em>Who Are You, Charlie Brown?</em> is shortlived. The answer — by this telling at least — is straightforward enough that the film should be renamed “Who Are You Charles M. Schulz?” The thesis of this bite-size tribute (directed by Michael Bonfiglio) — cartoonist as blueprint for his own character — is not complex but neither is it unfounded. The stuff of Schulz's youth — insecurity, shyness, iffy haircuts — all duly ended up as <em>Peanuts</em>. The sheer candour involved goes a long way to explaining how a lonely childhood in 1920s Minnesota became a global phenomenon still beloved by millions. There always were a lot of Charlie Browns.</p> <p>The melancholy is an odd match for the film, bright and sugar-frosted. A clue to the tone lies among the credits — the co-producer is the eerily chipper Ron Howard. But somehow the corporate gleam only accents how singular the Schulz worldview was, eternally fair-minded, embracing of misfittery. Despite the dolour, Charlie Brown was also a model of how to carve out stubbornly a place in the world. After all, Schulz once said, “If anyone should give up, he should” — a truth he knew better than anyone.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from June 25</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Who Are You, Charlie Brown? — the story of the man behind Peanuts' FT.com 23 June.
