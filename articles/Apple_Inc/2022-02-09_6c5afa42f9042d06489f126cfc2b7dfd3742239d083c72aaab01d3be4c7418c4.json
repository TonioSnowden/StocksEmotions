  "title": "Stock-Trading Ban Gains Traction in Congress; Pelosi says she expects consensus to emerge pretty soon on legislation",
  "text": "<p>\"It's complicated, but members will figure it out, and we'll go forward with what the consensus is,\" she said. \"I assume they'll have it pretty soon.\"</p><p>She said that she wanted any legislation to also require additional financial disclosures from federal judges. \"It has to be government wide,\" she said.</p><p>Republicans have also shown interest in new rules. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is considering backing new limits on lawmaker stock ownership, according to an aide, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who said he holds his investments in a mutual fund and advises colleagues to do the same, said he would need to examine the issue.</p><p>Lawmakers and their immediate families bought $267.4 million of assets and sold $363.5 million last year, according to Capitol Trades, with both figures down from the prior year. The value of trading in stock options roughly doubled in 2021, to $25.9 million from $12.8 million a year earlier.</p><p>The developments come amid greater scrutiny of trading by top government figures. Late last year, the Federal Reserve imposed restrictions on senior officials in a bid to address a stock-trading controversy that prompted the resignation of two reserve bank presidents. Also, a Wall Street Journal investigative series found more than 100 federal judges violated federal law by hearing lawsuits involving companies in which they reported owning stock.</p><p>Administration Committee Chairman Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.)—an ally of Mrs. Pelosi—has begun evaluating different bills to review the merits of different approaches, an aide said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said he has asked Democratic colleagues to unify around a single bill, calling it an important issue for Congress to address.</p><p>One bill, led by Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.) and Chip Roy (R., Texas), would require lawmakers, their spouses and dependent stocks to put stocks, futures and derivatives into blind trusts, which are managed by outside advisers. Another, led by Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D., Ill.), would ban lawmakers and senior staffers, but not spouses, from trading in stocks and other investments.</p><p>\"The American public thinks that members of Congress are self dealing, and the American public deserves to trust us more,\" Ms. Spanberger said. \"We don't need to talk about it for the next year.\"</p><p>Other issues to be ironed out include the treatment of capital gains if lawmakers were forced to sell investments.</p><p>As one gauge of the growing support, Ms. Spanberger's measure now has 46 sponsors, including more than a half-dozen Republicans. Mr. Krishnamoorthi's has 50 sponsors, including three Republicans. In the Senate, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.) has unveiled a companion bill to require lawmakers to put stock into blind trusts, while Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Steve Daines (R., Mont.) are advancing a measure to ban trades, including by spouses of senators and House lawmakers.</p><p>One of the issues involves how to regulate spouses who trade stocks. Several lawmakers, including Mrs. Pelosi, have spouses who regularly buy and sell investments. Mrs. Pelosi is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and for 2021 disclosed dozens of trades made by her husband in shares of Apple Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., among others.</p><p>\"If you were using classified information you had access to or privileged information and you yourself weren't trading but your spouse was going back and forth?\" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D., Mich.), who is a sponsor of both House bills. \"It just contributes to a perception that Congress can enrich themselves off these jobs.\"</p><p>Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D., Pa.), who sits on the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over the subject, said that she thinks it ultimately will be important to ensure that congressional spouses cannot directly trade in individual stocks.</p><p>\"I suspect it is because otherwise it's too easy to evade,\" said Ms. Scanlon, who is currently signed on as a co-sponsor of Mr. Krishnamoorthi's bill. \"But obviously, there's all the problems that you start running into, say, for example, if one spouse trades stocks for a living.\"</p><p>Backers of new rules for Congress say it could create a burden for some colleagues but that it is necessary for public trust. According to a recent poll by the Trafalgar Group and Convention of States Action, 76% of voters think members of Congress should be barred from trading stocks while in office.</p><p>The executive branch bars cabinet members and other government appointees from owning individual shares, but they are allowed to put off paying capital-gains taxes on sales as long as they reinvest their gains into other holdings such as mutual funds and Treasury bonds.</p><p>Eliza Collins and Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com</p><p>Stock-Trading Ban Gains Traction in Congress</p>",
