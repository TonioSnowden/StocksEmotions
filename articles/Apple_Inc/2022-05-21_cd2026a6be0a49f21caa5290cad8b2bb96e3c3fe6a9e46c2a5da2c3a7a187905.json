  "text": "<p>Five days later, Russian forces abruptly withdrew from Dymer as they buckled under Ukrainian resistance. They didn't take Mr. Kharchenko along. He barely survived when advancing Ukrainian units sprayed his car with bullets and is now in custody, facing trial on charges of collaboration with the enemy.</p><p>All around occupied parts of Ukraine, Russian forces have tried to find locals who would support their attempts to root out Ukrainian resistance and to install puppet administrations. In some parts of the country, particularly the south and the east where the occupation persists, they have had some success, recruiting current or former mayors, council members and other prominent locals, some of whom had never voiced pro-Russian views.</p><p>But, by and large, the Russians have had to make do with little-known figures like Mr. Kharchenko. They have installed a janitor as deputy mayor in the southern town of Berdyansk and an antivaccine blogger as deputy governor of the occupied Kherson region.</p><p>While Mr. Kharchenko couldn't be reached in detention and nor could a legal representative be found, his mother, Iryna, said he was simply trying to aid Dymer's residents when official Ukrainian authorities had disappeared. \"The same people who used to come here and say, please help us, have now turned against him,\" she said.</p><p>Ukraine has opened 914 criminal cases for treason, punishable by a life sentence in wartime, and 788 for collaboration with the enemy, punishable by 15 years in prison, since the invasion began, said the General Prosecutor's office. Suspected collaborators still working for the Russians in occupied areas face even greater risks because Ukrainian forces see them as legitimate military targets.</p><p>When the Ukrainian military withdrew from the town of Kreminna in the eastern Donbas region last month, they booby-trapped the city hall and the police headquarters. As Russian authorities gathered there to appoint a new mayor, the buildings exploded, killing many people, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister who provided footage of the blasts' aftermath.</p><p>The case of Mr. Kharchenko, the only Russian-appointed town mayor known to be in Ukrainian custody, highlights the complexity of the moral choices under occupation. In Dymer, some 20 residents were killed by the Russians and more than 40 are still missing, said town authorities. Yet, residents are divided about how much to blame Mr. Kharchenko for their suffering.</p><p>Zoya Koval said her husband, Vyacheslav Kolchuz, a veteran of the Ukrainian military who fought against Russian-backed statelets established in Donbas in 2014, was detained by Russian troops in Dymer on March 11. She said she sought information about her husband's fate from Mr. Kharchenko to no avail. She later learned her husband was in jail, where he likely remains today.</p><p>\"People hate him. I am surprised he's still alive,\" Ms. Koval said of Mr. Kharchenko. \"If I could, I would rip out his Adam's apple myself right now.\"</p><p>The Security Service of Ukraine, which is supervising Mr. Kharchenko's detention pending a trial, said he is suspected of providing the Russians with names of Donbas war veterans and members of the Territorial Defense, in addition to helping occupation forces in other ways. The agency said it wouldn't provide further information or make the suspect available for an interview. Ukrainian law enforcement didn't release Mr. Kharchenko's name, but his identity was confirmed to The Wall Street Journal by local authorities and residents.</p><p>Mr. Kharchenko's neighbor Andriy Liskov, a retired Ukrainian soldier who kept weapons in his home, says he and many other veterans weren't bothered by the Russians during the occupation. Once the Russians arrived, Mr. Liskov said he warned Mr. Kharchenko that he would be killed if he informed on his neighbors. \"He used to know many people, he knew how many weapons I had,\" Mr. Liskov said. \"But he didn't tell anyone.\"</p><p>One of the first Russian checkpoints was set up a short walk from Mr. Kharchenko's family home, where a red truck he used for his clothes- and shoes-trading business remains parked. \"I've been waiting for you for so long,\" Mr. Kharchenko told the Russian troops when they arrived, showing them his phone and boasting that he watched only Russian media, according to neighbors who say they witnessed the exchange.</p><p>By then, electricity and gas supplies had been severed by the fighting. Mobile-phone signal reached only a few spots. Food began to run out because the roads to Kyiv were cut after Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge south of Dymer to slow the Russian advance. The only way to evacuate people and to bring in food and medication was by making a risky crossing over the Kyiv Sea.</p><p>Mr. Kharchenko and a friend worked with the Russians to bring humanitarian aid to Dymer, said Mr. Kharchenko's mother, Iryna. \"Occupation was tough, and he was only trying to help out,\" she said.</p><p>Russian officials approached more prominent residents of Dymer with offers of collaboration, but were usually rebuffed. \"Let's work together, you will live well, have high pensions, cheap gas, cheap electricity,\" Svitlana Stankevych, a town council member, said a Russian officer told her.</p><p>She says she replied that she was too old for any public role. \"Tell me where the nationalists live,\" the officer persisted, she said. \"What do you mean by nationalist?\" Ms. Stankevych says she retorted. \"If I like my homeland like you also do, does it make me a nationalist?\"</p><p>Oleksandr Striletsky, a neighbor of Mr. Kharchenko, said he was detained alongside some 30 people.</p><p>On April 2, the Russians were gone from Dymer for good under pressure from Ukrainian troops. Mr. Kharchenko's friend escaped with them. Why Mr. Kharchenko stayed behind is a matter of debate. His mother, said she raced to the town hall to warn her son that the Russians were leaving. \"He told me in response, but why should I leave? I have not done anything bad, it's my home,\" she said.</p><p>Dymer's legitimately elected mayor, Volodymyr Pidkurhannyi says that Mr. Kharchenko was telling residents that the Russians would be back within days. \"He really believed that the Russians would be here forever.\"</p>",
