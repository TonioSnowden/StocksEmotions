  "text": "<p>That on the silent horizon, something<br>Not a sunrise rose, half itself and half <br>The horizon, dragging its bulk, its lights<br>And salts, from under shifting sheets of sea,<br>Leveling the sky into shallow moats<br>Of sounds, flecks of birds, beginning again<br>To believe all brief and sideways dreaming<br>To be, as previous was the complaint,<br>Lint on time's black coat, blanketing the west,<br>Becoming the unfathomable death mask<br>Freckled with stars, rendering itself<br>As its other, as though to mirror la,<br>But not mirroring it, and therefore now<br>Mirroring it, all sumptuous unscripted<br>La, la mirroring la like the pricked prong<br>Of a tuning fork that, for all its song,<br>Between sensation and sensation is<br>Still nothing but air, a titan's dying<br>Air, a titan's dying air now again<br>A titan's surging flame, an ancient flinch<br>In an ancient sun mirrored and made<br>Into la, the void in the voice, the voice<br>In the void, lala: aiai, song and pain,<br>Song and pain, song and pain, and there it is.</p> <p><em>From ‘Living Weapon', to be published in the UK by </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0571366279?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0571366279\"><em>Faber</em></a><em> on January 21 (£10.99) and in the US by </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0374539324?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0374539324\"><em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux</em></a><em> on February 18 ($24)</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a><em>.
