It's quite possible that while on a yachting trip in the Hamptons, sipping on some <strong>Ace of Spades</strong>, they came up with the idea that Square should buy Tidal. The reason? Because it can.&#xa0;</p> <p>Over the past year, Square's share price rose by almost 500 per cent. In 2020, revenue from sellers was $3.5bn, its “Cash App” segment, including a business that allows users to transfer money online, saw revenues of nearly $6bn. Oh, and it also made $4.6bn from bitcoin trading fees. So you can see why $300m is not much of a problem for Square.</p> <p>The deal is also a coup for Jay-Z and the group of musicians who bought Tidal in 2015 for $56m. Their lofty aim to “forever change the course of music history” never materialised and Tidal has barely kept up with much bigger streaming platforms such as <strong>Spotify</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's because most artists' music is owned by big record labels, so it's difficult to make their songs exclusively available to Tidal. Even Jay-Z, who owns the rights to much of his musical catalogues, ultimately caved to working with competitors as Tidal struggled to draw in enough listeners.&#xa0;</p> <p>But there is a clear shift happening in the music industry that Dorsey may have caught on to — several big-name artists are selling their music rights. <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d78e536b-6465-4518-b32b-e662a68c8484\">sold his entire catalogue</a> to <strong>Universal Music</strong> for $300m. That's one way to ensure exclusivity and a continuing income stream from artists.&#xa0;</p> <p>Regardless, Dorsey and Jay-Z will get to hang out much more now that the musician has been named to Square's board.</p> <h2>How an insurance decision triggered Greensill's unravelling</h2> <p>We've spent a lot of time on <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> lately — but the story is still moving fast.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest huge development is that <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>'s <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> has stopped making payments to the ailing finance group — a stunning schism because the links between the two have been so close that they've drawn the scrutiny of regulators.&#xa0;</p> <p>Catch up with the story by DD's Rob Smith and the FT's Michael Pooler and Sylvia Pfeifer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2be5828-a4d1-475f-96ba-de239ae968a7\">here</a>. And we've pulled together a collection of our reporting on the Greensill story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>One critical thing to understand in all of this is the role of insurance — the supposedly sober, even sleepy, side of finance — in triggering this week's chain of events, which the FT's Tom Braithwaite spells out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30069077-b966-4f41-a4df-f79aadcf0479\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>In short: the reason <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> suddenly announced on Monday that it was freezing $10bn in funds linked to the company came down to a lapse in the insurance covering the credit.&#xa0;</p> <p>The main original insurance policy was written by <strong>The Bond &amp; Credit Company</strong>, an Australian insurer that was acquired in 2019 by <strong>Tokio Marine</strong>. In July 2020, Tokio Marine said it would not extend or renew any Greensill policy — and that it had dismissed the underwriter in charge of the account.&#xa0;</p> <p>That insurance had allowed investors to treat the fund as almost risk-free. Without it, the Greensill machine was stuck.&#xa0;</p> <p>Greensill had spent months trying to find an alternative insurer, to no avail, court papers show. Whatever Tokio Marine's reason, its decision last summer spelt the end.</p> <h2>Petrobras: oil and politics</h2> <p>Who would want to be the chief executive of a state-controlled oil company? (Or an investor in one, for that matter.)</p> <p>The head of Brazil's <strong>Petrobras </strong>recently found out exactly what a thankless task it can be when the country's rightwing president,<strong> Jair Bolsonaro</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f0825c5-b6f1-4f2e-8305-f557364a3257\">moved to replace him</a> with an inexperienced army reserve general following a dispute over fuel price increases.</p> <p>For shareholders, the abrupt ouster of <strong>Roberto Castello Branco </strong>must have stirred unpleasant memories. It didn't go down well: Petrobras' São Paulo-listed shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68b0c6cf-7d78-4e0e-9025-bfaca7e098e2\">tumbled 20 per cent</a> after the decision.</p> <p>Petrobras gained international notoriety in the middle of the past decade for its role at the centre of a massive political corruption scheme. Uncovered by the <em>Lava Jato</em> (Car Wash) investigation, the scandal rocked the country and led to the arrest of former presidents.&#xa0;</p> <p>But arguably, just as harmful was the political meddling under former leftwing leader <strong>Dilma Rousseff</strong>, who forced the oil producer to slash fuel prices in a bid to tame inflation — interference that cost the group $40bn, according to Castello Branco.</p> <p>With the government controlling 50.5 per cent of Petrobras voting rights with just 36.8 per of the company's shares, a serious concern for minority shareholders is whether the oil group will stick to its policy of setting fuel prices in line with international rates.&#xa0;</p> <p>As Bolsonaro gears up for a re-election bid next year, he is under pressure from the powerful truckers' lobby amid rising living costs. The fear will be that this episode could be a harbinger of further populist interventionism in the economy.</p> <p>The former army captain's administration has nevertheless insisted it is pressing ahead with promised structural reforms to kickstart Latin America's largest economy. A key plank is the privatisation of large state-controlled entities, including power generator <strong>Eletrobras</strong>.</p> <p>Prospective investors please form an orderly queue . . . </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters </strong>has promoted capital markets partner <strong>Hwang Hwa Sim</strong> to global head of the practice.
