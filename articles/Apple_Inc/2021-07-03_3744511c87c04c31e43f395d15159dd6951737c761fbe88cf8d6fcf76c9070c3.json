  "title": "Summer's Sweetest Workout: Building Fudge Muscles --- Candy makers toil extra hard lifting, slicing, pouring; 'Superman would work here'",
  "text": "<p>Americans are flocking back to tourist towns and hankering for fudge, that dense, sugary vacation mainstay. At the same time, a national labor crunch means fewer fudge producers are toiling extra hard, nursing sore bodies and building fudge muscles.</p><p>\"Who needs the gym when you're doing this?\" says Angela Martel, a fudge maker at the Candy Corner in Hampton Beach, N.H.</p><p>The tight hiring market prompted Candy Corner to recruit for this season on Indeed.com for the first time in its 23 years, but even so, it has just one fudge maker -- Ms. Martel -- instead of the preferred two, says co-owner Kristen Statires.</p><p>\"Everyone is definitely working more and working harder,\" Ms. Statires says. \"The feet hurt a lot.\"</p><p>Ms. Martel, who is 24 and started in April, enjoys seeing the joy that a slice of mint swirl or peanut-butter fudge can bring. Seeing her biceps get more toned while working in a candy store was an unexpected perk. \"It's definitely more of an arm workout than I'm used to,\" she says.</p><p>Fudge took off as tourism grew after the Civil War, eventually becoming a summer standby alongside saltwater taffy and funnel cakes. Proprietors say fudge gets customers into the store because of its aroma and entertainment value; it's often made in the open so families can stop, watch and drool.</p><p>On Michigan's Mackinac Island, the Original Murdick's Fudge vents fudge fumes onto the sidewalk, where it offsets the smell of droppings left by the horses drawing buggies, says owner Bob Benser Jr. \"You smell horse manure but you also smell wonderful fudge,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Benser predicts a record season at his seven open stores, in Michigan and on Massachusetts' Martha's Vineyard. But he says filling jobs is his biggest challenge, despite offer sweeteners such as bonuses, free meals and housing.</p><p>Some in his fudge brigade are working six or seven days a week, getting extra pay as well as workouts. Virginia Backus, 19, glanced at her Apple Watch the other day and saw she had walked 7 miles during her shift as a \"fudge slinger\" behind Murdick's long counter. \"You're running back and forth. It's turtles at one end, maple walnut at the other,\" she says. \"It's literally like a Zumba class.\"</p><p>Making the confection is a labor-intensive process that can't be fudged. At Murdick's, sugar, butter and cream and often chocolate heat in a copper kettle to around 235 degrees. Fudge makers pour batches -- weighing 32 pounds each -- onto a marble slab for cooling. They use a 4-foot-long wooden spade to continuously mix and turn the fudge while walking around the table, and then deploy two sizes of hand tools, akin to putty knives, to shape loaves. Then comes the task of manually cutting the mass into 64 half-pound slices of fresh fudge so fast that \"it's almost like a Benihana in a way,\" says Mr. Benser, the owner.</p><p>\"That's a tough job, slicing,\" he says. \"Bending over those tables and slicing fudge, you can feel it in your core and your back. You've got to be in shape to slice.\"</p><p>Carnel Samuels, who is 44 and a veteran fudge maker at Murdick's, says he feels like he is busier than ever. He does sample fudge most days for quality control but doesn't need to buy a gym membership; he takes at least 15,000 steps a day, according to a phone app that measures his steps. \"I go home and go to sleep,\" he says.</p><p>Jason Dugan, an owner of Douglass Fudge in Wildwood, N.J., says his fudge maker is getting in great shape. \"He's jacked. He's cut up,\" he says.</p><p>Job ads make clear fudge work isn't just a sweet gig.</p><p>\"You must be able to lift 50+ pounds and be enthusiastic!\" says a post for jobs starting at $14 an hour at fudge shops in Frankenmuth, Mich., a tourist destination known as \"Little Bavaria.\"</p><p>The Fudgery, a company with stores nationwide, used to try to limit shifts to six hours because of the physical demands, but the current labor shortage means employees are doing 8- or 10-hour shifts and pay is up, says Jennifer Wilson, the chief financial officer. \"You're more active on the job and getting more hours,\" she says. A recruitment pitch on its website says, \"Superman would work here (if he was real).\"</p><p>Supervisors high up the dessert chain are jumping in. \"My boss has more fudge muscles than me,\" says April Purdie, the general manager at Turtle Town, a Black Hills, S.D., candy business that features homemade fudge.</p><p>Ms. Purdie says she has nine employees this summer, down from about 16 pre-pandemic. Turtle Town is trying to hire more. She has come up with workarounds to having too few cooks in the kitchen. For instance, it takes two people to pick up the kettle pot of liquid fudge -- \"it's about 65 pounds if it's full of fudge,\" she says -- and pour that on the slab. That means she may need to briefly call an employee away from a customer to help pour. To keep visitors from feeling stranded, she plies them with fresh, hot samples of fudge. \"It totally cures everything,\" she says. \"They're not so salty once they have sugar in their face,\" she says of customers.</p><p>Three Bears General Store in Pigeon Forge, a Tennessee mountain town, makes around 300 pounds of fudge a day. On a recent day, 56-year-old fudge maker Mark Parton planned to work into the night to keep up on making some of the 21 fudge varieties including peanut butter, peanut-butter pie and red velvet. \"It's a real-upper body workout,\" he says. \"You tell someone you make fudge and they say, 'Oh, OK.' They think about some little pan or something. They don't even have a clue.\"</p>",
