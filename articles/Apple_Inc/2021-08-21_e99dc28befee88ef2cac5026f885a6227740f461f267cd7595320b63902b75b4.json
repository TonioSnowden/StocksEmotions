  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  New Host of  'Jeopardy!'  Steps Down  Amid Flap  ----  By John Jurgensen",
  "text": "<p>   The long, fraught process of replacing Alex Trebek blew up Friday when the new host of \"Jeopardy!\" stepped down from the job nine days after landing it. </p><p>   Mike Richards, an executive producer of the game show, had already weathered controversy over his inside role in the hiring search and his involvement in past employment lawsuits when Sony Pictures Television named him as host last week. </p><p>   On Wednesday, however, the Ringer reported on crass remarks and jokes Mr. Richards had made on a podcast about eight years ago. That resulted in outcry, especially from \"Jeopardy!\" fans and former contestants who view the show as a bastion of egalitarian intelligence. The public response convinced Sony that it would be impossible for Mr. Richards to continue as host, and prompted his decision to exit that role, according to a person familiar with the situation. </p><p>   Now production has halted on \"Jeopardy!\", one of the most valuable properties in television, as Sony lines up one or more stand-ins, and plunges back into the process of hiring a permanent host. Meanwhile, Mr. Richards remains on the \"Jeopardy!\" staff as executive producer, raising questions about why he was allowed to keep that job, and how he would interact with the host who eventually replaces him. </p><p>   Sony defended the decision and drew a distinction between the role Mr. Richards would have played as the face of the show and his role behind the scenes. \"Mike has been with us for the last two years and has led the Jeopardy! team through the most challenging time the show has ever experienced,\" the company said. \"It is our hope that as EP he will continue to do so with professionalism and respect.\" Mr. Richards also serves as executive producer of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" </p><p>   Companies are increasingly contending with how to respond to pressure from fans, social media and staff when executives and talent come under fire for past comments. This year Conde Nast let go a recently named editor in chief for Teen Vogue over past racist and antigay social-media posts;   Apple Inc. parted ways with a prominent advertising-technology engineer over sexist passages in a memoir; and Walt Disney Co. dropped \"The Mandalorian\" actress Gina Carano for social-media posts that upset fans. </p><p>   \"Over the last several days it has become clear that moving forward as host would be too much of a distraction for our fans and not the right move for the show,\" Mr. Richards wrote in a memo to staff.  As such, I will be stepping down as host effective immediately.\" </p><p>   Mayim Bialik, the actress Sony hired at the same time as Mr. Richards to host the game show's prime-time specials and spinoffs, will remain in that role. A representative for Ms. Bialik didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   The five \"Jeopardy!\" episodes Mr. Richards taped Thursday -- his first and last day in the role of full-time host -- will air as scheduled in September, according to a person familiar with the situation. </p><p>   Mr. Richards's resignation as host marks the latest and biggest debacle for the sedate game show, which had operated smoothly for more than three decades under Mr. Trebek. Though its viewership has eroded since the death of Mr. Trebek last year, \"Jeopardy!\" remains one of the most popular shows in syndicated television. </p><p>   The Ringer article dissected a podcast Mr Richards co-hosted called \"The Randumb Show.\" On the podcast, he made disparaging remarks about women, used a Jewish stereotype and used derogatory terms for little people and mentally disabled people, according to the article. All episodes of the podcast were deleted from the free site that had hosted them. </p><p></p>",
