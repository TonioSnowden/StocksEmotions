  "text": "<p>   Here are a couple of things to know about \"Cherry,\" now streaming on Apple TV+. No one in it is likable, let alone endearing or lovable. And nothing is understated, ever ever ever. Economists may disagree on the threat of inflation, but it's the curse of this madly overwrought film, which attempts to inflate a gritty novel about the horrors of war and opioid addiction into the epic journey of a troubled soul from alienation through nihilism to salvation. The running time is inflated too -- 142 minutes that feel even longer because of slo-mo sequences meant to confer a holiness on moments of mundane behavior, and a randomized approach to storytelling that assigns equal emotional weight to young lovers pledging their fidelity and armored vehicles stuck in the mud during an ambush in Iraq. </p><p>   The source material was the semiautobiographical debut novel of the same name by Nico Walker, a former Army medic and heroin addict who wrote it on a typewriter while he was serving time in prison for bank robbery. The perpetrators of the screen version are two heavy hitters from the superhero genre, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo; they directed from a script by their sister, Angela Russo-Otstot, and Jessica Goldberg. The hero, a cherry in the military-slang sense of a soldier who hasn't yet been in combat, is played by Tom Holland, a fine and subtle actor in other circumstances. Ciara Bravo is Emily, the hero's girlfriend, then wife, then helpmate in addiction. </p><p>   Actors traditionally serve their director's vision. In this case one element of the co-directors' vision involves lifting extended prose passages from the book and giving them to Mr. Holland to intone, either in big gobs of voice-over -- \"They wanted to kill so bad there was a profligate confidence in our firepower\" -- or straight to the camera, a technique that's just as efficient in distracting from whatever drama may be playing out on the screen. Watching the hero talk to the camera while robbing a bank, I wished he would just shut up and live his life without commenting on it. (Cinematographers serve their directors too. The shooter was the superb Newton Thomas Sigel, whose images achieve a sententiousness that's in keeping with the production as a whole.) </p><p>   When I described the Russo brothers as heavy hitters from another genre I meant it only as a compliment. They've worked boldly and brilliantly on a huge scale as writers, directors or writer-directors of such monuments to the power of summer blockbusters as \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Captain America: Civil War,\" \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame.\" And, not incidentally, to the power of what I called emotional bandwidth in my review of the first of those four films -- making plenty of room, and devoting sufficient attention, to the lives the characters live vividly in between their tumultuous escapades. </p><p>   The problem in \"Cherry\" is a gross miscalibration of scale. The story, as written by Mr. Walker, is not an epic, but a minutely detailed account of how an indifferent college student is transformed, by horrific circumstances and his own failings, into what he himself calls a \"scumbag.\" It's a seemingly inexorable sequence of events -- dropping out of school, saving grievously wounded comrades in battle, then PTSD that leads to addiction and crime. They are familiar events, but brought to life in new ways by intimate, shockingly raw prose. </p><p>   In bringing the book to the screen, the filmmakers have gone for blockbuster effects at the expense of bandwidth. The love scenes aren't intimate, only clumsy, trite or maudlin, while the action sequences are absurdly out of scale, as if staged for audiences who have never seen drill sergeants yelling at recruits, the chaos of combat, a bank being robbed or junkies shooting up. Sometimes the style seems intentionally self-parodying, as if to say this is a collection of classic cinema tropes offered for the delectation of audiences who really have seen it all. For the most part, though, big moments are staged at full intensity, and heightened by grandiose camera swoops or unintentionally self-parodying opera arias. \"Cherry\" is a film for the age of information overload. It shows us more than we need to know, and leaves us feeling little or nothing about it. </p><p></p>",
