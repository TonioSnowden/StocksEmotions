The company is considered a bellwether for the tech world because it makes major electronics products, while also serving as a components supplier to competitors including Apple Inc.</p><p>Samsung and other chip giants have seen their pricing power increase, as a pandemic-fueled surge in demand for semiconductors has created widespread shortages. Global businesses had hoped the supply crunch might dissipate by year-end. But the shortages look likely to extend into 2022, if not longer.</p><p>The chip industry is on a major investment spree. Intel Corp. recently said it would build new chip-making facilities in Europe valued at as much as $95 billion, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has said it would spend a record $100 billion over the next three years to increase production capacity.</p><p>Samsung said it plans to boost investments by one-third to more than $205 billion over the next three years, in part to pursue leadership in chip manufacturing.</p>",
