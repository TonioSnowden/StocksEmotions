  "title": "Marriott Posts Quarterly Gain From Leisure Travel While Delta Softened Corporate Bookings; Hyatt Hotels bounces back from a string of losses during the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>\"In August, global demand softened a bit, primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies' return to the office,\" Mr. Capuano said on a conference call. \"However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October.\"</p><p>Special-corporate bookings for future stays were down slightly below 40% in October from the same month in 2019, Mr. Capuano said. He said the company estimates that the segment has been making up for roughly half of room nights from short business stays.</p><p>Marriott, whose portfolio encompasses roughly 7,900 properties world-wide, said its profit rose to $220 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 from $100 million in the same period last year. The company absorbed the effects of the Delta variant during the second half of the quarter, Mr. Capuano said.</p><p>Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $3.95 billion from $2.25 billion, beating expectations of analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The Bethesda, Md., company said comparable systemwide revenue per available room, a closely watched industry metric known as RevPAR, was $90.32, more than double what it was a year earlier but down nearly 26% from the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>Occupancy was 58.2%, up 23.4 percentage points from a year earlier, but down 16.8 percentage points from 2019's levels.</p><p>Hyatt Hotels Corp. on Wednesday also noted gains from leisure travel. The company turned a profit of $120 million for the third quarter, bouncing back from a string of losses during the pandemic.</p><p>\"Leisure demand continues to lead the recovery, and momentum for business and group travel is growing,\" President and Chief Executive Mark Hoplamazian said. \"The recovery is evident in more markets as travel restrictions ease and borders reopen.\"</p><p>Hyatt said it has closed its $2.7 billion purchase of all-inclusive-resort manager Apple Leisure Group from its private-equity owners, KKR &amp; Co. and travel-and-leisure specialist KSL Capital Partners LLC. Big hotel companies are adding more all-inclusive resorts, betting that the pandemic will boost a business model that encourages guests to stay in one place.</p><p>Hotels, like other businesses, are grappling with the effects of rising costs. Marriott expects many of the cost-reduction programs it has implemented to be maintained as occupancies rise, finance chief Kathleen Oberg said on a conference call. Those initiatives could help offset inflationary pressures in the labor market, she said.</p><p>\"Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled, but our cost-reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years,\" Ms. Oberg said.</p><p>The company has seen a slight uptick in job applicants going into the fall, Ms. Oberg said. Progress with vaccinations could have added more comfort around participation in the labor force, she said in an interview.</p><p>\"While we still have many open positions [that] need to be filled, we're comfortable that we've made and we are making solid progress in our hiring levels,\" Ms. Oberg said.</p><p>Many hotels, after suspending housekeeping at the start of the pandemic, now clean only when guests request it. The practice began over infection concerns, and some guests still prefer not to have staff in their rooms during stays. The cutbacks also reflect staffing shortages, lower occupancies and hotel owners' desire to reduce expenses, hotel analysts say.</p><p>Mr. Capuano said Marriott has held discussions with its hotel owners and franchisees in North America to \"move towards a more definitive and permanent position on housekeeping.\"</p><p>Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. in late October reported a quarterly profit and higher revenue as it saw leisure travel remaining its driver of recovery and business travel continuing to pick up in the third quarter.</p><p>Hospitality Industry</p><p>More articles on developments related to the pandemic, selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* The Kids Are Getting Their Covid-19 Vaccine, the Parents Are Buying Plane Tickets</p><p>* Housekeepers, Hotel Owners Square Off Over Daily Service</p><p>Write to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>Marriott Posts Quarterly Gain From Leisure Travel While Delta Softened Corporate Bookings</p>",
