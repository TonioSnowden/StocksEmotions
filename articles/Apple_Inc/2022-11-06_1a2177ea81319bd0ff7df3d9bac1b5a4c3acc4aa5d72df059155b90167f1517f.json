  "text": "<p>The dated technology confused her much the way smartphones can trip up older users. Why was it so dark in there, and where should she look? The quick succession of flashes surprised her. Then it took about three minutes for the machine to spit out a photo strip, which emerged wet with a sharp, chemical smell.</p><p>She didn't like how the first pictures turned out, so she tried another set. Ultimately, the pair pumped in more than $60 for 10 rounds of old-fashioned snapshots.</p><p>Worth it, they decided. \"Even though we now have an iPhone 14 with better lenses,\" Ms. Gultom said, \"it just doesn't beat the experience of doing something by yourself or with your friends and capturing it with an actual strip of film.\"</p><p>Dip-and-dunk photo booths are drawing a burst of interest from teenagers and 20-somethings who grew up with phones that snap and store high-quality digital pictures. The retro film strips satisfy a craving for authenticity among young people weary of hyper-edited social media feeds.</p><p>This past summer, social-media influencers began trekking to photographer Bryant Eslava's Los Angeles apartment to memorialize themselves in his film booth. Mr. Eslava developed the idea for his project-turned-viral-series after finding images of celebrities captured by the photo booth in the studio of MTV's \"Total Request Live,\" which aired for a decade beginning in 1998.</p><p>\"The photo booth pictures are so iconic,\" Mr. Eslava said. \"They feel so timeless.\"</p><p>Vintage photo booths peaked in popularity in the late 1990s before plummeting as affordable digital cameras and smartphones entered the market, said Jeff Grostern, the third-generation owner of Montreal-based Auto-Photo Canada. He said his 69-year-old company saw a 40% drop in sales in the five years after the iPhone emerged in 2007.</p><p>Visitors to Mr. Eslava's booth included Zach Jelks, a 22-year-old content creator with more than 6 million followers on TikTok. Primarily known for his comedic videos, Mr. Jelks brought glasses, a hat and other props.</p><p>He said it took him four strips to get the hang of the booth's timing.</p><p>\"The pictures came out really good,\" he said. \"It just made me happy.\" Unlike Instagram, where filters can drastically alter one's appearance, the photo booth \"just really captures people's beauty.\"</p><p>Inspired by such viral images, others are making expeditions to try out the old-school photo technology. Google searches for \"vintage photo booth\" in August hit the highest levels in 15 years and have remained elevated, Google Trends data show.</p><p>Interest in buying them also has increased, according to Photomatica, the California-based business that installed the booth in Mr. Eslava's apartment. The company fields a half-dozen inquiries a day, up from just a handful a week, co-owner Matt Dewalt said.</p><p>The costly and clunky 800-pound film booths aren't for everyone. Refurbished models can command $40,000, Mr. Dewalt said, and require constant upkeep.</p><p>Photomatica instructs clients on how to troubleshoot a paper jam, how to change the chemicals and how to tweak the camera settings. \"It's not an iPad,\" Mr. Dewalt said. \"It's an actual machine.\"</p><p>Birdy's, a dive bar in Brooklyn, has had a film photo booth in the back near the pinball machines since opening in 2015. Co-owner Andrés Simmons said he recently started noticing more \"really young people\" using it. This summer, the booth began running out of film and chemicals days before the weekly refill from a technician.</p><p>Newcomers often are perplexed by how long it takes the mini-darkroom to process pictures, and some customers become convinced the machine is broken. \"We've had people get mad when the photos don't come out right away,\" Mr. Simmons said.</p><p>The quirks appeal to many young users. First-timers say the loss of control makes for a special experience—so different from snapping endless shots on phones. Film cameras such as Polaroids also experienced a resurgence in recent years.</p><p>\"They're not going to be perfect, and you wait for your image to get printed and accept what it is,\" said Vivian Le, a 24-year-old graphic designer who posted a TikTok video highlighting various New York photo booths. \"It's like a little surprise, and I think that's why people also enjoy them.\"</p><p>Some influencers use editing software and filters to make digital photos look like they were taken in classic photo booths. Jayne Chen, 23, a community engagement specialist at Lyft and a freelance photographer, encountered the filters on social media, but she decided to try out the real photo booths. \"Everything's all about authenticity,\" she said.</p><p>Richie Cohen, 59, and Duane Tragis, 61, were nicknamed \"photo booth boys\" during college because of their daily snaps at a five-and-dime store near Rutgers University.</p><p>The couple has collected four shoe-box-sized containers of photo strips since the 1980s and has been posting them in popular TikTok videos. That young people are drawn to classic snapshots makes sense to them.</p><p>\"When we were using the photo booth in the 80s, we were very much into nostalgia,\" Mr. Cohen said. \"We were always looking back to the 50s and 60s, wishing we could have lived back then.\"</p><p>Vintage Photo Booths Are Back, and Baffling Newbies. 'It's Not an iPad.'</p>",
