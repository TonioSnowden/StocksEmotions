  "text": "<p>Philadelphia -- The images that line the walls of a 1,100-square-foot gallery of the Penn Museum are not readily recognizable. In one, strips of crystal marked by glowing red imperfections seem to glint with spectral light along a blue background. Another seems to display a gray postmodern sculpture of organic forms with ridges and swirls. A third -- one of the few that are geometrically regular -- shows intertwined layers of rope, its strands wrapped haphazardly with pitted blotched metal.</p><p>The photographs -- some two dozen of them -- are mysterious, alluring, even beautiful -- and all the more strange when you learn that the first portrays the minerals in a volcanic rock, basalt, that was mixed into clay and used to make stronger roof tiles in Turkey during the sixth century B.C.; a tile was magnified 200 times and then photographed with polarized light. The second is the result of an experiment in 2016, at the University of Pennsylvania, in which rice grains were burned after they had sprouted and fermented, so they could be compared with those discovered in archaeological digs. And the third is of silk fibers wrapped in silver or silver-covered gold that had been woven into a shimmering textile from 17th-century Iran.</p><p>The multiple surprises offered by \"Invisible Beauty: The Art of Archaeological Science\" come first from the images themselves and then from discovering what they are. But we are also offered unexpected glimpses of the living world that originally gave shape to these artifacts, some of which are on display. We are led into the objects (literally and figuratively) with the aid of magnification, infrared illumination, X-rays, magnetic field detectors -- turning the invisible visible. And then, the newly revealed evidence is interpreted to reveal an artifact's origins, just as forensic examinations of corpses might lead to an understanding of the final moments of life.</p><p>Exhibitions are usually focused on the seen rather than the unseen, on object rather than process. But as the curators -- Marie-Claude Boileau, director of the Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials at Penn and a professor of classical studies, and Sarah Linn, a research liaison at the museum -- explained in conversation, since they were kept from their usual archaeological explorations by the Covid-19 pandemic, they decided to unveil the work done in labs, behind the archaeological \"scenes.\" Many images come from classes that Ms. Boileau's center offers at the university, such as \"Plants and Society,\" \"Archaeology of Animals\" and \"Introduction to Digital Archaeology.\" And some of the artifacts analyzed come from the museum's stunning collection.</p><p>Thus we see a dagger dating from 2600 to 2450 B.C. that was discovered in Penn's excavations of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Ur. A 50-times-magnified photograph shows not the blade's metal, but earthen-colored woven threads: \"fossilized fabric.\" In the dagger owner's tomb, minerals replaced the organic fibers of the sheath but retained the cloth's form.</p><p>Another example from Penn's Ur collection is an image of \"impure gold\" pocked with mineral deposits and veined with microscopic impurities. It shows a gold bead from Queen Puabi's 4,500-year-old cloak, which can be viewed at the museum. The gold used was panned from a river and its elements have been identified; they suggest the gold didn't come from the ruler's domain, but was traded from northern regions, originating in what is present-day Afghanistan or Iran.</p><p>Less evident to the untrained eye is the lesson disclosed by an image, magnified 50 times, of a Neanderthal tooth dating from 38,000-37,220 B.C. and discovered in France. I can see how, in another example, the exhibition's magnified image of a pig's tooth dating back more than 6,000 years shows wear from chewing tough vegetation, but a model or animation might have helped to make the Neanderthal evidence more clear: Angles of scratches suggest which hand was regularly used to hold the food. We read: \"The direction and angle of the scratches\" on this tooth \"reveal that the young individual was left-handed. This is a rare find -- current research shows that only one in ten of our ancestors were lefties, just like today.\"</p><p>Left-handedness, trade routes, burial practices, dietary customs, soil conditions -- such are the characteristics of ancient and less ancient worlds, teased out of their remains. As for the aesthetics, the photographs along with a few display cases of artifacts and tools show objects that are not necessarily beautiful in themselves, but reflect other forms of beauty upon examination: the systematic order of weaving, the calculated order of manufacture, the accidental order of ingredients, the natural order of the material world.</p><p>The exhibition is calculatedly modest: It does not claim too much for itself. It tends more to miscellaneous impression than systematic vision. But given how stricken museums and their patrons have been in the past year, its charm and sense are welcome -- as is its informal touch. At the show's close there is a photograph that was taken using an iPhone 6 at zero magnification, as we are told in the label. It is dated \"2020 CE, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" It reveals a \"Very Crowded Desk\" on which Twyla, the \"feline assistant to co-curator,\" Ms. Boileau, lies contentedly sprawled across \"the interpretive plan for this exhibition,\" demonstrating some of \"the challenges of working from home and writing labels.\" Nearby is a thousand-times magnification of a cat's hair.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Rothstein is the Journal's Critic at Large.</p>",
