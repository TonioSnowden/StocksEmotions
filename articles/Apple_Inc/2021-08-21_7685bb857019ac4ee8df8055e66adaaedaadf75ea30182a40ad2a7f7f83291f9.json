  "title": "REVIEW --- Weekend Confidential: Malcolm Mitchell --- A Super Bowl champion on a mission to spread the power of literacy.",
  "text": "<p>It wasn't the first time that Mr. Mitchell's poor reading skills had gotten in the way. He often had to pause kung fu movies to stumble through the subtitles. At a grocery store near campus, he mistakenly bought apple sauce instead of apple slices because he read the label wrong. But at 19, it was his envy of the intellectual confidence of his peers that ultimately pushed him to hit the books. \"I was fearless on the football field,\" he explains. \"I didn't want to be afraid of the classroom.\"</p><p>Today Mr. Mitchell, 28, is a writer himself. His second children's book, \"My Very Favorite Book in the Whole Wide World,\" will be published next month in a bilingual edition with English and Spanish side by side. Retired from the NFL because of injuries, he devotes himself to traveling the country to promote literacy, particularly among students from disadvantaged backgrounds like his own. \"Children listen to me because I look like many of them,\" he says. His Share the Magic Foundation, now in its fifth year, has reached hundreds of thousands of students through in-person school events and free virtual programming, including a READcamp to keep kids reading over the summer. The organization has distributed nearly 60,000 free books to kids in underserved communities.</p><p>\"If I could have convinced all of my friends as a child to read, they would have made better choices,\" Mr. Mitchell says over Zoom from his home in Atlanta, which he shares with his partner, Jasmine Erves, and their 1-year-old son. Statistics from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a child-welfare charity, show that students who struggle to read by the end of third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school than proficient readers. \"I want children to understand the importance of reading so they can give themselves a shot at living their best life,\" he says.</p><p>As a young student, Mr. Mitchell never really saw the point of working hard in class. \"School itself is not motivating to children who grew up in the environment I did,\" he explains. \"Why get an A when you can get a 70 and still go on?\" His focus was on football, which he started playing in fourth grade after seeing how his family rallied behind his older brother when he was on the team. A couple of years later, when his mother moved the family from Tampa, Fla., to Valdosta, Ga., Mr. Mitchell wasn't getting much playing time at his new school and threatened to quit.</p><p>But his mother, who raised him and his two siblings largely on her own while working at a call-center and earning a degree in social work, taught him that while adversity is often inevitable, it can also be an opportunity. She told him a story about what happens to a carrot, an egg and coffee beans when they are dropped into boiling water. The heat makes the carrot limp and the egg hard, but the coffee beans don't succumb to the water; instead, they transform it. \"Be the coffee beans,\" his mother said.</p><p>Mr. Mitchell says that he kept playing football not because he thought it could be a career, but because the games were a rare time when he saw his mother smile. \"My mother is why I am who I am,\" he says. \"She's extraordinary.\"</p><p>As a star player on a top high-school team, Mr. Mitchell had his pick of college scholarships. But when he arrived at the University of Georgia, he realized that he was behind his peers academically. \"They were so articulate and accomplished,\" he recalls. \"I said to myself, 'I want that.'\" After hearing Curtis Jackson, the rapper known as 50 Cent, talk about Robert Greene's self-help book \"The 48 Laws of Power,\" Mr. Mitchell tried reading a copy. \"It was heartbreaking,\" he recalls. \"I had to look up every other word.\"</p><p>Demoralized but not discouraged, he saw that he needed to \"start from scratch.\" At 20 he was reading \"The Giving Tree\" and \"Exclamation Mark,\" paying close attention to punctuation and writing down new words. He then moved on to graphic novels, young-adult novels like the \"Harry Potter\" series and adult fiction before exploring essays and biographies. He discovered that he loved learning about people he would never otherwise meet and examining thorny ideas from unexpected points of view. \"The more you read, the more you open yourself up to different perspectives,\" he observes.</p><p>While recovering from knee surgeries in 2013-14, Mr. Mitchell was scanning the shelves at an Athens, Ga., Barnes &amp; Noble when he noticed an older woman holding several books. He struck up a conversation, hoping to get a book recommendation, and was excited to learn that she belonged to a book club. He earnestly asked if he could join and ended up spending two years discussing novels with a group of women older than his mother.</p><p>Eager to promote \"the magic of reading\" to youngsters, Mr. Mitchell was a college senior when he decided to write his own children's book. At the time, strict NCAA rules barred college athletes from making business deals, so he had to publish \"The Magician's Hat\" himself and sell it exclusively through the University of Georgia bookstore. The book became a local bestseller and earned him the Children's Author of the Year award from the Georgia Writers Association.</p><p>Mr. Mitchell's NFL career was brief but dramatic. The New England Patriots chose him in the fourth round of the 2016 draft, and the investment initially paid off. His six catches for 70 yards helped the Patriots beat the Falcons in the Super Bowl the following year. But after more knee surgeries and \"countless\" cortisone shots, Mr. Mitchell had to hang up his jersey in 2019 and figure out who he was without football. His life, he says, felt \"like playing Jenga and removing too many pieces from the bottom.\" It took time, therapy and a lot of books to build himself back up.</p><p>Today Mr. Mitchell devotes his time to Share the Magic, working on his third book for young readers, and raising a little bookworm at home. He and his partner make a point of reading to their son every night and always make sure he is surrounded by books. \"By the time I learned about books, people in school were saying they weren't cool,\" he says. \"I want to give him a chance to form an opinion before the world tells him what to think.\"</p>",
