At Tuesday's 11-month closing low of $628.16, the stock had plummeted 49.9% since closing at a record $1,229.91 on Nov. 4, 2021.</p><p>The electric vehicle maker's stock has been hurt by supply chain issues and COVID-19-related lockdowns in China, as well as concerns that Chief Executive Elon Musk may be distracted, and could selloff some of his holdings as a result of his buyout deal for Twitter Inc.
