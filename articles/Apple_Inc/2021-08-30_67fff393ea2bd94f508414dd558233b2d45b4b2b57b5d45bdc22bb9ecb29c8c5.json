  "text": "<p>South Korea's plan to become the first country to block Apple and Google from automatically charging high commissions for in-app purchases is being pored over by developers everywhere. A ban could supercharge app maker profits. In South Korea, local developers paid more than $1.7bn to app store operators last year, according to industry data. </p> <p>Lawmakers are considering whether or not the US tech duopoly should be prevented from demanding in-app payments are made exclusively through their mobile platforms. This would limit commissions charged on digital content purchases.</p> <p>For Google, whose Play Store accounts for more than 80 per cent of the Korean app market, a new law would mean losing out on growing demand for mobile content. Google is estimated to have made $1.3bn in South Korean app store commissions last year. If it lost half of that to local payment rivals it would equal about $650m. It might lose about $500m on fees from non-game content such as web comics, e-books and music. </p> <p>Spending on smartphone app stores has been growing every year. It got an extra boost from bored phone owners during the pandemic. Taking commissions on in-app payments is a lucrative business for Google and Apple, which dominate the app economy in many countries. </p> <p>Google's Play Store reported operating margins of more than 62 per cent in 2019, according to court filings in a US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03dd917c-15ba-4832-8214-591ac330c35a\">lawsuit</a>.&#xa0;Apple's App Store had operating margins of almost 78 per cent in the 2019 fiscal year, according to expert witness testimony in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc8fd505-2e75-4646-b2a7-34d32796f32a\">lawsuit</a> with Epic Games, maker of the Fortnite video game. </p> <p>Gaming companies would welcome any change to app store fees. Shares of Nexon, South Korea's biggest game-maker, are down more than 16 per cent in the past year amid weak sales and rising costs. Nexon receives a third of its revenues from mobile sales. Lower commissions on sales would boost net income. The same is true for peer SundayToz, which gets more than two-thirds of sales from in-app payments. </p> <p>For US tech giants, lost revenue from the Korean market is a relatively minor setback compared to the fear that a new law might set a precedent elsewhere. Pricing by local Korean payment rivals could redefine how their services are valued. The days of 30 per cent app store fees could be nearing an end. </p><p>Source:  2021 'South Korea/Google: potential app store commission change could set a global precedent' FT.com 30 August.
