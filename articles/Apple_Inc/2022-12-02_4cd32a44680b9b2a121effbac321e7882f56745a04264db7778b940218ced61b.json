  "text": "<p>Unsurprisingly, Peter proves to be nasty, brutish and improvident. \"By the Christmas after they were married, Eliza knew perfectly well that the wealth he had wooed her parents with was a mirage,\" writes Ms. Smiley, who, with just a couple of words—\"perfectly well\"—puts a nice little spin on a straightforward sentence. Fortunately for Eliza (and for the novel), Peter isn't around long. Soon after the couple marries and moves from Kalamazoo, Mich., to Monterey, Calif.—Peter thinks he's going to strike it rich there in the Gold Rush, but the action has long since moved to San Francisco—he's shot dead in a bar brawl.</p><p>Ms. Smiley, the author of many works of fiction set in the rural Midwest and the West—including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"A Thousand Acres,\" the farcical \"Moo\" and the trilogy \"The Last Hundred Years\"—is a Balzac of the wide open spaces; her canvases tend toward the broad and well-populated. Though more modest in scale and scope than some of Ms. Smiley's previous books (sometimes a bit too modest), \"A Dangerous Business\" still has plenty on its mind. It is, among other things, an affecting account of a young woman coming into her own.</p><p>With Peter gone, Eliza has to make her way in the world—and that world is going to be Monterey. Returning to Kalamazoo, and to the circumscribed life she had led with her staunchly Presbyterian parents, is possible but distinctly unpalatable. Admittedly, the options are few for women in the bustling coastal town: re-marriage, menial labor.</p><p>If Eliza's a little nonplussed when she's offered work in a brothel, she's game. Just another way of saying she's practical and she's a survivor. The apple, in this instance, has fallen far from the tree, as Ms. Smiley notes with characteristic slyness. Her parents had slept in separate rooms. Her father was to \"knock if he wanted to enter (because, if he came in suddenly, he would give Mother a headache).\"</p><p>A couple of years on, life in Monterey is good. The brothel's kindly madam, Mrs. Parks, is as protective of her charges as the headmistress of a finishing school and as interested in their intellectual—and perhaps moral—development. At one point she gives Eliza a copy of \"The Scarlet Letter.\" Make of that what you will.</p><p>With nearly $50 in the bank, Eliza is that rare thing for a woman of her era: financially independent. Her customers, many of them sailors, tell her of their grand adventures on the high seas, tip her generously and sometimes give her novels, a luxury she can't afford. \"David Copperfield\" is a current favorite. She has a close friend, Jean, a sometimes cross-dresser who's in the same line of work but at an establishment with a strictly female clientele (an ahistorical flourish on the part of the author). Perhaps best of all, the locals aren't the sort to ask probing questions. \"Perhaps,\" Ms. Smiley notes, \"the reason for that was that there were few churches.\"</p><p>But Monterey becomes far less appealing when a young prostitute turns up dead on the outskirts of town, then another and yet another. Disturbingly, the response from the local sheriff is indifference. Chilled by his inaction and by Grundy-ish public opinion (\"those girls know what they are getting themselves into\"), and all too aware that they could be the next victims, Eliza and Jean join forces to find the culprit, combing the town and environs on foot, in a horse-drawn cart and, when things get serious, on horseback. They take their inspiration and crime-solving cues from C. Auguste Dupin, the canny detective from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\"</p><p>Here, as in other Smiley novels, the physical world features prominently. She vividly describes a wild storm coming in off the bay and the topography of the land where Eliza and Jean go sleuthing: the curving pale beaches, the anfractuous terrain, the creaking tree limbs. And as in several of Ms. Smiley's previous adult and young-adult novels, including \"Perestroika in Paris\" and \"Riding Lessons,\" horses play a key role in \"A Dangerous Business.\" They signify self-determination; they spell freedom.</p><p>But for all of its offbeat charms and its welcome message of female empowerment 19th-century style, \"A Dangerous Business,\" at just over 200 pages, feels both too short and too long. The small-town milieu and period setting limit Eliza's activities. Thus there are many accounts of her daily constitutionals up or down Franklin Street, Jefferson Street and Pearl Street. And there are many accounts of her visits to a restaurant known to the citizenry as the Bear. The menu doesn't seem to change much, or perhaps Eliza is just partial to hotcakes. Things seem only slightly livelier at work, where Eliza's clients are prudishly described as \"doing their business\" or managing to \"finish their business.\" Wincingly, one of them tells Eliza, \"you are a kind hussy.\"</p><p>A side plot about ghosts goes nowhere, and while the murder strand of the story starts off intriguingly and the tension builds as Eliza and Jean consider and eliminate suspects, its resolution feels rushed and unsatisfying—too much reader investment for too puny a payoff. Still, and this is no small thing, we have Eliza and Jean. Their pluck, their grit, most of all their ineffable belief in the power of books, make \"A Dangerous Business\" matter.</p><p>Ms. Kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the Journal.</p><p>'A Dangerous Business' Review: Widow Out West</p>",
