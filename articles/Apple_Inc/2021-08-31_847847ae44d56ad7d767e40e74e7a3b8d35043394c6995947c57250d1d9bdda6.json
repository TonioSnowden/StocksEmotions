  "text": "<p>In an email to employees Tuesday, Alphabet GOOGLGOOG Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the company's voluntary return-to-office policy has been extended until Jan. 10, 2022.</p><p>“Beyond January 10, we will enable countries and locations to make determinations on when to end voluntary work-from-home based on local conditions, which vary greatly across our offices,” he wrote. “To make sure everyone has ample time to plan, you'll have a 30-day heads-up before you're expected back in the office.”</p><p>Google workers can still work from the office on a voluntary basis. The tech giant employs around 135,000 people.</p><p>Pichai also announced two more “reset days” — essentially bonus days off — to “rest and recharge,” Oct. 22 and Dec. 17.</p><p>“The road ahead may be a little longer and bumpier than we hoped, yet I remain optimistic that we will get through it together,” Pichai wrote.</p><p>Many tech companies had been targeting a September return to offices, but due to the upswing in COVID-19 cases, Apple Inc.AAPL, Facebook Inc.FB and Amazon.com Inc.AMZN have already announced that employees won't be required to be back at the office until January.</p>",
