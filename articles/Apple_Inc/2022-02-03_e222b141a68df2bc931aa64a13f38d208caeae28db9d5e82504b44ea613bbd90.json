  "text": "<p>“2021 was an exciting year for Snap and we made significant progress growing our business and serving our global community,” Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in a statement. “The strength of our core business has enabled us to accelerate our investments in augmented reality, transforming the way that the Snapchat community experiences the world through our camera.”</p><p>Snap was already feeling Meta Platform Inc.'s FB pain after the company formerly known as Facebook reported a meta-bust of a quarter on Wednesday. Snap's stock cratered 23% in Thursday trading to close at $24.51, a 52-week low, before rebounding in after-hours trading.</p><p>Snap&#xa0;posted a net income of $22.6 million, or a penny a share, compared with a loss of $113.1 million, or 8 cents a share a year ago and besting street predictions of a loss of 9 cents a share, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Snap's adjusted earnings were 22 cents a share.</p><p>Snap's sales improved 42% to $1.3 billion, which topped Street estimates of $1.2 billion. Company executives had earlier offered guidance of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion.</p><p>Snap said it expects the Apple privacy changes and global supply-chain disruptions to linger a few more quarters. Executives issued first-quarter revenue guidance of $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion, in line with the $1 billion projected on average by analysts polled on FactSet.</p><p>Thursday's precipitous drop in stock erased recent gains; Snap shares have nose-dived 48% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX&#xa0;has dropped 6% in 2022. Shares of Meta, by comparison, are down 29% this year, while Pinterest Inc. PINS&#xa0;is off 32% and Twitter Inc.&#xa0;TWTR&#xa0;is down 20%.</p><p>Snap reported 319 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, edging an average analyst forecast of 317 million, according to FactSet.</p>",
