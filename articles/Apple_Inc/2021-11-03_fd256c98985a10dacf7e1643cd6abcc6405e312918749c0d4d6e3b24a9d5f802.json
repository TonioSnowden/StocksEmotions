  "text": "<p>I WAS INTRIGUED when, in a recent interview, Grammy-winning musician Lorde revealed the simple trick she uses to resist the kaleidoscopic temptations of her smartphone: adjusting her settings to switch to a grayscale-only display. Could a bleaker screen curb my own digital dependency, a habit the pandemic has only exacerbated?</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What tricks help you to cut down on your phone usage? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Anything that makes your phone less of a shiny treasure helps,\" said Devorah Heitner, author of \"Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World,\" explaining that, for many, a more stagnant existence in the Covid era made it harder to resist the stimulation of devices.</p><p>\"Many don't realize how much deliberate color psychology goes into app design and development,\" said Carissa Lintao, an ethicist at the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology. \"Turning off all colors is one way to strip your app usage down to the basics, because grayscale doesn't engage us as well as color does.\"</p><p>To enable the mode on an iPhone, go to accessibility settings, then to display and text size, and flip the color filter toggle to \"on.\" Directions vary for Android models, but YouTube offers videos that will walk you through the steps.</p><p>Other chronic scrollers have found success adopting the black-and-white tactic. Aiva Strelca, a copywriter in Riga, Latvia, struggled to fall asleep in the pandemic's early months, and resorted to exploring Pinterest into the wee hours. \"It was a crazy [phone] addiction, I didn't really know what to do,\" said Ms. Streica, 25. Setting her Android to switch to grayscale mode 30 minutes before bedtime proved a cure. \"In grayscale my phone just wasn't that interesting anymore,\" she said. Candice Criscione, 41, a travel planner in Florence, Italy, whose phone habits were robbing her of time with her sons, concurs: \"It definitely isn't fun to look at Instagram if it's in black and white.\"</p><p>But would switching my own phone to grayscale for a week prove just as helpful?</p><p>First, the good news: My phone use dropped by 11% compared to the week prior, according to Screen Time, the iPhone function that tells you how much time you're spending on your device and what you're doing.</p><p>The bad: Even with that 11% reduction, I still clocked an average of 6½ hours a day. And, since I sort my apps by color, I struggled to find tools I actually needed. When driving, I found using Google Maps without color borderline dangerous—there just wasn't enough contrast. More frivolously, I didn't appreciate the unintentional artiness of the photos I took. (Switching my display back to full-color revealed their true hues.)</p><p>In the end, my own lack of self control undermined the experiment. Every night after a long day of grayness, I snuck into my settings and guiltily toggled my way back to the full spectrum. The call of \"SortPuz,\" a soothing color puzzle game, was just too strong.</p><p>Put Down Your Phone</p><p>Switching to a grayscale display isn't the only way to make your tech less diverting, distracting and demanding of your attention. Here, four other expert- and user-recommended strategies.</p><p>1. Silence Bings and Tings</p><p>Ms. Heitner recommends turning off all text alerts and any kind of app notification to cut down on distractions. \"Though it does annoy my husband when he's trying to reach me,\" she joked before adding that you can set your phone to allow designated people (like spouses, or her husband's 91-year-old mother) to get through those firewalls.</p><p>2. Take Fewer Photos</p><p>\"Without the content to post on social media, I don't end up scrolling through hours of posts after uploading a video or a photo,\" said Julia Bobak, content creator for coffee company Home Grounds</p><p>3. Set a Timer</p><p>\"Really try to schedule your time on distracting apps,\" said Ms. Heitner, who will often use an ending cue like an 8 p.m. family-movie-night commitment to make sure she's stopped scrolling and gotten all her work done by then. Otherwise, she added, \"we might all be on our own devices scrolling endlessly and then it's bedtime.\"</p><p>4. Hide Your Apps</p><p>Ms. Lintao likes to hide certain apps, or even to take particularly distracting apps off her phone altogether to make them harder for her to access. (To hide apps on an iPhone: First, drag the apps you want hidden to a new page on your home screen. Then, tap and hold on an empty part of your screen until the apps begin to jiggle and tap on the dots at the bottom of the screen. Uncheck the page where you put the apps you want hidden.)</p><p>Want to Cut Down Your Screen Time? We Put One Trendy Strategy to the Test</p>",
