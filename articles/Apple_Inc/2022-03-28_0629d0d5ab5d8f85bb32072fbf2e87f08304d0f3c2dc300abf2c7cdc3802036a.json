  "text": "<p>Corning Inc.'s new finance chief plans to focus on hiring and managing inflation as he builds on his predecessor's long-term strategy for growing the glass maker's business.</p><p>Ed Schlesinger last month succeeded Tony Tripeny, who retired after 36 years with the Corning, N.Y.-based company, including six as its chief financial officer. Mr. Schlesinger, who joined the manufacturer of displays for iPhones and iPads in 2013, previously served as senior vice president and corporate controller.</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Tripeny recently discussed inflation, chip shortages and how the company's financial strategy has evolved over the years. Edited excerpts follow.</p><p>WSJ: Tony, what was the hardest part of being CFO?</p><p>Mr. Tripeny: The challenges that came up during Covid, because none of us had ever been through a pandemic before. The biggest thing was how do you restructure the workforce when demand is rapidly declining. We put together a program that was really focused on doing things to reduce the near-term salary costs. Everybody at the professional level took a salary cut. We put equity in place in exchange for that, based on employees' pay level.</p><p>WSJ: What did you focus on during your six years as CFO?</p><p>Mr. Tripeny: One of the big things that we really focused on is our value-creation model and our approach to capital allocation and how we communicated that with investors. A lot of focus the last few years was on really strong financial stewardship, working our way through crises like Covid and the supply-chain crisis.</p><p>WSJ: The company reported higher sales and higher profit in 2021, with net sales—at $14.08 billion—up nearly 25% from 2020. Net income was $1.91 billion, up from $512 million in 2020. What's the company's exposure to inflation and supply-chain issues?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: Despite the pandemic and the supply-chain disruptions, we're actually performing really well. The only impacts we're seeing are from inflation, raw-material costs and logistics. And we've got plans underway to mitigate that through increased prices. We took a significant number of price actions in the back half of 2021. We expect that to take hold in 2022 and our profitability to improve.</p><p>We're seeing the chip shortage impact our automotive segment. In the back half of 2021 in particular, automotive production ramped down significantly. We still see that level of lower production. When eventually the chip supply and automotive production increase, we feel very well positioned to supply our customers in that respect.</p><p>WSJ: How else are you responding to higher costs?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: We're spreading the volume we have across multiple suppliers and looking for alternative freight and logistics sources. We're monitoring higher energy costs and determining how that will impact us in our various locations.</p><p>WSJ: Ed, what have you learned from Tony?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: We take a long-term view and Tony has taught me that on two fronts. From a capital-allocation perspective, we really invest in research and development. During difficult times and good times, we consistently allocate capital to organic-growth opportunities and we preserve our ability to invest. The second thing that he reminded me of all the time is, from a finance function perspective, you have to spend time on the long-term things that matter. Tony was really dedicated to talent, ensuring that we build a finance function that could grow with Corning.</p><p>WSJ: Have you raised salaries and offered more bonuses?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: We are certainly increasing compensation and looking to do that as labor wages increase. We added a significant number of employees in 2021, and as we continue to grow, we will look to add more workers. It'll be all over the world and will depend on where we have those opportunities. For example, we significantly increased our headcount in Mexico, which is one of our largest manufacturing facilities. [Note: The company said it employed 61,200 people as of Dec. 31, up 22% from a year earlier.]</p><p>WSJ: How are you planning to allocate capital?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: There's significant demand for optical communications, such as 5G, broadband and cloud computing. We will look to leverage infrastructure spending in the U.S. and also in other countries like Germany, the U.K. and Canada. We prioritize these investments over things like acquisitions. We look for a return on invested capital of 20% or more when we invest capital in new capacity. And then of course, continuing to return cash to shareholders. In 2021, we raised our dividend [by] 9%. In 2022, just most recently, we raised it another 12.5%. We'll continue to look for ways to buy back shares and reward shareholders with the excess cash.</p><p>WSJ: Do you plan to spend more on product development than before?</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger: As we grow, we will continue to spend more. The most important thing is that we generate a significant amount of cash. We use that cash to invest for organic growth. We do that in the form of research development and engineering. The allocation will probably remain about the same as a percentage of our sales. [Note: The company said its research, development and engineering expenses last year fell 13.8% to $995 million, compared to the previous year.]</p><p>WSJ: Tony, what are you going to do next?</p><p>Mr. Tripeny: My wife and I are going to move down to South Carolina. I'm at the beginning stages of talking to folks about either private-equity advisory opportunities or board opportunities.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at Mark.Maurer@wsj.com</p><p>Corning's New CFO and His Predecessor Discuss Hiring, Inflation and Moving On</p>",
