  "text": "<p>A UK-listed digital privacy company controlled by billionaire Teddy Sagi has agreed to pay almost $1bn to acquire one of the best known global virtual private network providers. </p> <p>Kape's deal to buy rival ExpressVPN from its founders for $936m in cash and shares is one of the biggest struck by a UK technology company in recent years. It is the latest in a series of acquisitions by Kape which has transformed from a small, Aim-listed advertising technology business into a consumer privacy and security company with an £800m market capitalisation. </p> <p>Virtual private networks, or VPNs, allow users to connect to the internet in a secure and private manner. </p> <p>ExpressVPN, which is based in the British Virgin Islands, is one of the better known providers of the technology and was the first company to launch servers that wipe all content when they are restarted. It has 3m paying subscribers, 40 per cent of which are in North America. Last year its revenue rose 37 per cent to $279m.</p> <p>In 2017, ExpressVPN <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e83e8034-7543-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\">accused Apple</a> of choosing to “side with censorship” after its app was one of a number of VPN services to be removed from the iPhone maker's Chinese online store. Apple said at the time it had been “required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet . . . new regulations”. </p> <p>ExpressVPN was co-founded by Peter Burchhardt, a former Microsoft executive, and Dan Pomerantz in 2009. The duo, alongside family members, will be paid $237m in Kape shares and a deferred cash consideration of $172.5m each. Both executives will stay with the company after the takeover. </p> <p>Kape will fund the acquisition by a placing of new shares to raise about $350m and a separate retail offer. Unikmind Holdings, Sagi's company, will provide financing for the deferred consideration payments and debt refinancing to complete the deal quickly.</p> <p>Kape will have 6m subscribers after the tie-up. The combination will provide more firepower for ExpressVPN to develop its Lightway software and its <a href=\"https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/privacy-analysis-opioid-addiction-treatment-recovery-apps/\">research arm</a>. </p> <p>Sagi, a Cypriot-Israeli who founded gambling software company PlayTech, first invested in Kape in 2012 when it was a small Israeli advertising technology business called Crossrider. It rebranded and moved its focus to consumer privacy products and has been on an acquisition spree, buying out rivals ZenMate, Intego, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b76be07e-09f6-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">LTMI </a>and Webselenese. </p> <p>Ido Erlichman, chief executive of Kape, said: “This transaction ideally positions Kape to continue to expand our global footprint and product portfolio at a time when digital security and privacy has never been more important.”</p> <p>ExpressVPN's Pomerantz said: “It was essential to us that anyone we teamed up with shared our strong fundamental commitment to user privacy, and Kape has demonstrated that in spades through its family of brands.”</p><p>Source: Nic Fildes in London 2021 'Teddy Sagi's Kape buys rival ExpressVPN for $936m' FT.com 13 September.
