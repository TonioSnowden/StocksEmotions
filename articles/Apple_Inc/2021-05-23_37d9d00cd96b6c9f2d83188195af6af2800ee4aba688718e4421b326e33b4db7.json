  "title": "PageGroup's Steve Ingham: ‘Get fit, get out, and get on with life again'",
  "text": "<p>It was the stock exchange notice that no company wants to publish: Steve Ingham, chief executive of London-listed international recruiter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/eebebb55-92e4-49a1-9447-ede62f3ae11a\">PageGroup</a>, would be away from work “for a number of weeks” after suffering a severe back injury in a skiing accident.</p> <p>The short statement in 2019 failed to capture the jeopardy that its CEO had faced. Ingham had been skiing in the Alps on his own — the weather had been bad enough to close the ski lifts — when he fell off a narrow bridge into a gully.</p> <p>“I thought: this is going to hurt. And it hurt a lot. I was lying in a stream and straight away I thought I was paralysed — I couldn't feel my legs which should have been very cold.”</p> <p>He was right. The fall had fractured his spine, and left the 59-year-old with no hope of ever walking again.</p> <p>Finding help was the first of the challenges after the fall. His phone did not work and where he was lying in a gully made it difficult for any passing skiers to notice him.&#xa0;</p> <p>“There was an overwhelming desire to sleep. I knew that would be game over; one-way trip. My voice was getting weaker so I started throwing things. My gloves. Ski poles. And it was those that were spotted.”</p> <p>Ingham recounts the accident in the short, matter of fact sentences of a tale often told — but still has to stop for a few seconds to compose himself when describing the worry imposed on his family through the period.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is the only time that Ingham shows the emotional toll alongside the physical injury that left him facing a battle simply to get out of bed. He returned to the UK after a helicopter rescue and a stay in a Swiss hospital. In a specialist hospital near Aylesbury, he had only one thought: “Get fit, get out, and get on with life again,” he says. “And that's basically what I did.”</p> <p>Ingham is a big man — 6ft 4in tall and a former rugby player — which helped with the physical battle to train his body to cope with wheelchair mobility and restricted access to many of the things that he once took for granted.</p> <p>There was a steep learning curve — “how do you get dressed, use a wheelchair, jump a curb, get back in the car, have a shower” — but Ingham had his incentives: his daughter's wedding and going to Japan for the Rugby World Cup final.&#xa0;</p> <p>He also felt a responsibility to return to Page as quickly as possible given his feeling that the company's succession plans were not in the right place for him to step aside. For many people, he says, “I am Page”.</p> <p>Ingham has been CEO since 2006, but with the company since 1987, helping grow it from a few hundred people to a FTSE 250 group that employs more than 6,500 people across 37 countries.</p> <p>He almost immediately went back to running the company from his UK hospital bed. When he was strong enough to put a shirt on, he used an iPad to record a video message explaining the situation. It was shared with all Page staff. “Then I got about 7,000 text messages and emails. Which was a nightmare to answer.”</p> <p>He also started hosting meetings with the board and senior executives — even leading the company's second quarter trading update from a boardroom in the hospital. “I realised I could influence the business, frankly from my bed if necessary.”</p> <p>But he also wanted to be out of that bed as soon as possible — taking a corporate approach in incentivising the physiotherapists by buying them coffee machines and even taking many of them out for an expensive dinner.</p> <p>“I incentivised them to get me out on time,” he says, adding that the support from family and colleagues was also powerful. “You don't want to let people down — particularly my daughters, of course. I wanted to show my kids I could get up and out quickly and overcome these things.”</p> <p>Ingham also has the advantage of a naturally positive attitude that he says some have seen as strange given his injuries.&#xa0;“I was having to give visitors my positivity and making them feel better,” he says.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has not all been smooth sailing: several months later, he broke the titanium [the spinal hardware] in his back and ribs through over-exercising. There is still pain: “Nothing I can't cope with”, he says, but of the sort that is “wearing . . . tiring”. He stays away from painkillers, loathe to become reliant on any medication.</p> <p>He also admits to having other advantages — enough personal wealth to convert his London flat to work with his disability, and an office likewise accessible.&#xa0;</p> <p>The accident occurred in March 2019. He was back in the office by June. Within months, he was facing some of the biggest questions in his career as the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24e2a58a-387c-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">forced a freeze </a>on hiring and a steep drop in profits.&#xa0;</p> <p>Page was forced to cut about 1,000 jobs, mostly trainees or less experienced staff. “It was with regret but we are a business and had to protect those that we wanted to keep.”</p> <p>Taking such big decisions helped reassure people that he was still up to the job, but he says that there were still battles with people's perceptions over disability. One former colleague even warned that he would not be taken seriously any more.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I totally knew there was no way my staff would see it that way. I may no longer be towering over people but I was confident in my abilities.”</p> <p>“Gone are the days where CEOs are meant to be all things powerful,” he says, before adding that some managers still seem to consider both physical disability and mental health issues to be a stigma. </p> <p>He is now seeking to champion changes in the UK workplace to help others with disabilities. Page has groups that look at how employees feel included at work, including parents, and individuals who are LGBT+, from an ethnic minority and those with disabilities. Managers are required to carry out diversity and inclusion training, which covers unconscious bias and how to recruit inclusively. </p> <p>“I'm shocked by the employment and pay difference between abled and disabled,” he says, <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7540/\">pointing to statistics</a> that show that 81 per cent of able-bodied people are in work against 52 per cent of those who are disabled.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It doesn't matter whether it's somebody in a wheelchair, or whether they're blind or deaf. The sorts of challenges that they overcome day to day, the resilience they demonstrate, the stamina, the energy, and everything else actually makes them as good if not sometimes better.”</p> <p>This has turned into a more formal campaign. Ingham supported a letter written by Lord Shinkwin, a Conservative life peer, urging the prime minister to make changes to improve employment opportunities for disabled people — including mandatory workplace reporting.</p> <p>“Talent is what the CEOs talk about all the time — if they could retain better people then they would perform better, they'd be more productive. And yet, here we've got 20 per cent of the population that are disabled, and only half of them working. That is just wrong.”</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas in London 2021 'PageGroup's Steve Ingham: ‘Get fit, get out, and get on with life again'' FT.com 23 May.
