  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Private equity firm Bain Capital is expected to be in a position to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a48f469-ea7d-46b5-aa2e-2d75e4d930c3\">submit a formal proposal</a> to Toshiba “relatively soon”, according to people close to the situation, and has received indications of support for a potential deal from within the company's top echelons.</p> <h2>Delayed audits weigh on Martin Sorrell's comeback tour</h2> <p><strong>Sir Martin Sorrell </strong>has been confronted with numerical discrepancies before.</p> <p>The advertising world's tyrannical sun king, who through relentless dealmaking built <strong>WPP </strong>into a sprawling empire in the era of <em>Mad Men </em>glamour, left the agency that he had reigned over for 33 years <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/617147b4-6cda-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa\">in a scandal</a> over his personal conduct and use of company funds.</p> <p>Now, the 77-year-old has run into another bookkeeping-related conundrum at his digital-focused marketing agency <strong>S4 Capital</strong> after the company had to delay publishing its annual results for the second time this month — wiping more than a third (nearly £1bn) from its market value in the past two days.</p> <p>The issue first arose on March 1, when the agency announced that <strong>PwC</strong>, its auditor, needed more time to sign off its results due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on “travel and resource allocation”. On Wednesday, S4 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6e9b957-8d40-461b-a1f1-4eb88a034bdd\">issued a second statement</a> saying that the Big Four firm hadn't been able to complete “the work necessary” for it to go ahead with the preliminary annual results expected to be published the following morning.</p> <p>The London-listed group's share price fell as much as 14 per cent on Thursday, reflecting concerns that the delay could be about more than just Covid.</p> <p>S4 had been “eerily and worryingly silent” after it declined to explain the delay on Thursday, an analyst who preferred not to be named <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c65dbc9f-4a85-4493-bfde-c4647bf61b46\">told the FT's</a> Patricia Nilsson and Michael O'Dwyer.</p> <p>A different analyst, who also declined to be named, said it was unusual for an auditor to let a company know it would not sign off its results the evening before a planned release. “It clearly sounds very suspicious, but it could be a minor thing — we just don't know,” the person said.</p> <p>(It's not the first time a company has put off an annual report. Petrol station group<strong> EG Group</strong>, who enlisted <strong>KPMG</strong> as its auditor after <strong>Deloitte</strong> resigned citing concerns about the group's governance, is seeking to delay its audit for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d9985ad-b3d8-4cd9-b5bf-efffe7019e67\">third-year running</a>.)</p> <p>The situation has also put a damper on Sorrel's dealmaking comeback tour.</p> <p>Sorrell has always been a master of M&amp;A first, and an ad man second. He made his fortune by plucking WPP, what began as a maker of wire shopping carts, out of obscurity and into the world's largest media group by making key acquisitions including <strong>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</strong>, <strong>GroupM</strong> and <strong>Grey</strong>.</p> <p>The quest for vengeance against WPP has only given him more fuel, going head-to-head for deals against his former protégé<strong> Mark Read</strong> — and winning — to position S4 as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b314cded-92c6-489e-af71-77622506a5ec\">disrupter in an industry run by dinosaurs.</a>&#xa0;</p> <p>S4 beat out WPP in a bid for the sought-after Dutch production studio <strong>MediaMonks</strong> in 2018, the agency's first acquisition, and has since picked up various ad-tech groups to extend its digital capabilities.</p> <p>With PwC remaining quiet on the audit hold-ups, it's still unclear whether this is all just one big misunderstanding or something more.</p> <p>“With Martin you have one very simple rule: speak good, speak bad, but please, please speak of Martin. And if it is bad coverage, he will love it at least as much — maybe even more — because he would have a reason to fight,” <strong>Maurice Lévy</strong>, Sorrell's career rival and chair of the <strong>Publicis</strong> advisory board <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55d02167-dc39-463d-9f64-21fab8e68c0d\">once told the FT</a>.</p> <p>DD wonders how he's feeling about the coverage right about now.</p> <h2>NSO: Private equity, spyware and Abu Dhabi</h2> <p>For Israel's government, <strong>NSO Group</strong>'s spyware has been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24f22b28-56d1-4d66-8f76-c9020b1b5cb1\">diplomatic calling card</a>, an important part of its attempt to pry open relations with regimes including the UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Since 2019, however, one regime — Abu Dhabi — has had closer ties with NSO than previously known.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Mubadala Capital</strong>, a unit of the emirate's $243bn state-owned investment company, is one of the largest investors in the private equity fund that bought NSO three years ago, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Mehul Srivastava <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/09a289f1-1670-4b18-9ee2-5d9081e1773d\">reveal</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That means the Emirati government's money was used to buy a significant Israeli cyberweapon manufacturer even before the two countries signed a peace accord in 2020.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's how it worked. In 2017, the Mubadala entity committed €50mn to a private equity fund set up by <strong>Novalpina Capital</strong>. Half of those funds came from the sovereign wealth fund which is run by <strong>Manchester City</strong> football club chair <strong>Khaldoon al-Mubarak</strong>, and the other half from outside investors whose money is managed by Mubadala Capital.</p> <p>Two years later, that fund was used to buy NSO. Mubadala was notified only after the NSO deal was agreed, a person close to the group said.&#xa0;</p> <p>By the end of 2021, NSO was in crisis, blacklisted by the US and facing lawsuits from <strong>WhatsApp </strong>and <strong>Apple</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Around that time, the government of Abu Dhabi held internal discussions about potentially buying the beleaguered company outright — a sign of how much the UAE wanted unfettered access to the spyware, though the talks didn't progress.&#xa0;</p> <p>Several other investors in the Novalpina fund including Oregon's public employee retirement system and Alaska's $81bn permanent fund have in the past received letters from<strong> Amnesty International</strong> accusing them of being “directly linked” to “human rights abuse” because of their investment.&#xa0;</p> <p>At least until recently, others like Mubadala and the <strong>British Gas</strong> parent company <strong>Centrica</strong> had been able to keep their role quieter and avoid the opprobrium.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Spacs face a stricter future</h2> <p>Critics of Spacs have long called for their rules to be rewritten. More than two years since the blank cheque frenzy overtook Wall Street, the US securities regulator has delivered.&#xa0;</p> <p>The <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> on Wednesday announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28d9d0c7-aab3-4d75-9aa2-22d8b9efdef8\">sweeping proposals</a> to reform blank cheque vehicles, ultimately aiming to bring investor protections on Spacs more in line with traditional IPOs.</p> <p>For Spac bankers, the proposals mean more work, more liability and probably more pay as a result. Underwriters of the merger will be potentially liable for any misstatements and the credibility of deals that they stamp their names on.</p> <p>For Spac sponsors, the heyday of inflated projections are over as the SEC reins in the practice, likely to the anguish of promoters who have reeled investors in with outsize forecasts.&#xa0;</p> <p>The first big deal to kick off the Spac frenzy was <strong>Richard Branson</strong>'s space tourism company <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong>. The venture went public in 2019 by merging with a vehicle sponsored by “Spac king” <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong>.</p> <p>While Branson rocketed to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf3130f4-5f62-4f9d-941a-d1db98dc0233\">edge of space</a> last year, Virgin's revenues plunged. The company missed its forecast by 98 per cent, taking in just $3.3mn. It's an example that the SEC doesn't want to repeat.</p> <p>For now, Spac sponsors and advisers have two months to parse through the regulator's <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11048.pdf\">372-page document</a> and submit their thoughts. Happy reading.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p><strong>Universal Music Group </strong>has proposed appointing four new non-executive directors at its annual general meeting in May:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bill Ackman</strong>, the billionaire founder of hedge fund <strong>Pershing Square Capital</strong></p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nicole Avant</strong>, former US ambassador to the Bahamas</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cyrille Bolloré</strong>, chief executive of French conglomerate <strong>Bolloré Group</strong> which is among Universal's largest investors</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sherry Lansing</strong>, former chair of<strong> Paramount Pictures </strong>and founder of non-profit<strong> The Sherry Lansing Foundation</strong></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has appointed senior<strong> UBS</strong> dealmaker<strong> Sebastiaan van Loon</strong> as a managing director and head of real estate, gaming, lodging and leisure investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p> <p><strong>Freshfields</strong> has promoted its chief data officer <strong>Chris Smith</strong> to chief information officer.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Fantasy dealmaking </strong>A Pearson buyout <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f394147-869f-4731-8934-bbf3dccf26c1\">is every private equity investor's dream</a> — a cheap, undervalued asset with potential to adapt to the digital age, the FT's Cat Rutter Pooley writes.
