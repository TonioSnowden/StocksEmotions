  "text": "<p>\n   VALUES-BASED INVESTING options for conservatives have lagged behind those available to investors concerned about climate change, diversity and animal rights. Now conservatives are taking a page from liberal investors when it comes to their escalating criticism of technology companies that have banned former President Donald Trump and others from their platforms. The American Conservative Values ETF has just $5 million under management, but its promoters say the potential for growth is significant. </p><p>\n  The fund \"boycotts\" Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and roughly 20 other companies that it views as overly progressive in their corporate politics. \"There is no product for politically conservative people,\" Bill Flaig, the founder and chief executive of the fund's suburban Washington management firm, Ridgeline Research, told The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick. \"There is plenty of slicing and dicing for the other side.\" </p><p>\n  It has a counterpart on the left -- Democratic Large Cap Core ETF, a fund that holds shares in companies with at least 75% of political contributions from senior executives and corporate PACs going to Democratic candidates and political-action committees. </p><p>\n  Environmental, social and governance-based disclosure standards were frowned upon by Trump appointees at the Securities and Exchange Commission. President Biden's nominee to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, is much more open to ESG disclosures that some investors want. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  FANNIE MAE AND Freddie Mac will continue to charge a fee on homeowners who refinance their mortgages through at least Dec. 1, according to officials at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the government-controlled mortgage companies. </p><p>\n  Fannie and Freddie began charging the fee late last year to help recoup the costs of their response to the pandemic, including billions of dollars they set aside against possible loan losses. The 0.5% surcharge on refinanced home loans adds an estimated $1,400 to the average mortgage guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. </p><p>\n  FHFA officials said they should have clearer data by early October on whether the fee, which is designed to raise approximately $5 billion, will achieve its goals and can be phased out in December. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  BIDEN CABINET MEMBERS mostly have typical Washington resumes. But several also had more colorful resume items, according to financial disclosures. Secretary of State Antony Blinken served on the global advisory board of \"Sesame Street,\" which he once appeared on to discuss refugee policies with Grover. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas served on the board of New York's Tenement Museum, which chronicles the immigrant communities of the Lower East Side. </p><p>\n  Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (now transportation secretary) served on the board of his city's symphony orchestra, and former Mayor Marty Walsh (now labor secretary) was an honorary board member at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A BANKING RULE THAT  makes it easier for banks to partner with tech companies that hold consumer funds is to go into effect April 1 after Trump appointees finished it weeks before President Biden took office. Progressives in Congress have criticized the rule for lumping risky assets in with safer ones and could ax it with the Congressional Review Act, which can rescind late-term rules by a majority vote by August. </p><p>\n  Trump appointees still control the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and they say the rule will open financial services to underbanked populations. As an independent agency, it didn't have to follow Biden's Jan. 20 order to pause pending rule-making, and without Biden appointees in place, the rule won't be stopped administratively. Biden's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nominee is expected to be confirmed soon, but an intraparty fight has delayed his nomination of Comptroller of the Currency. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  MINOR MEMOS: Sen. Mitch McConnell demurs when asked about his favorite bourbon: \"That would be like asking me which of my daughters I preferred. No Kentucky politician will ever pick one bourbon\" . . . A Capitol riot suspect is receiving extra attention on social media after the FBI released photos in which the accused resembles \"Spaceballs\" and \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" star Rick Moranis . . . Trump when asked by a Fox News host about why he's weighing in on politics: \"Well you called me, I didn't call you.\" </p><p></p>",
