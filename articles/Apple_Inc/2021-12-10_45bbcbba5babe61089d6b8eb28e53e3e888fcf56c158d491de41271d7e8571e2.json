  "text": "<p>Netflix's NFLX much-hyped live-action adaptation of the anime classic “Cowboy Bebop” has been canceled less than three weeks after the show premiered, which was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.&#xa0;</p><p>The space western&#xa0;based on Shinichirō Watanabe's cult 1998 anime series follows three bounty hunters — Spike Spiegel (played by John Cho), Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir) and Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda) — who hunt down the solar system's most dangerous criminals.&#xa0;</p><p>The teaser art got a mixed reaction from fans ahead of the premiere, however, and the 10-episode first season has had similar mixed reception. It's certified “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes, with only a 46% positive rating from critics, and a 55% average audience score.</p><p>And while the show drew almost 74 million viewing hours worldwide since it debuted, according to Netflix's Top 10 site, it dropped 59% for the week of Nov. 29 to Dec. 5.&#xa0;</p><p>Insiders told THR that the decision to cancel was made by balancing the show's viewership and cost.&#xa0;</p><p>The cast and crew shared their disappointment on Twitter TWTR on Thursday and Friday. Co-executive producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach wrote, “I truly loved working on this” in one tweet. In another, he mused, “Had so much cool s— spanned for [season 2.]”&#xa0;</p><p>https://twitter.com/OKBJGM/status/1469089225987395584?s=20Cast member Mason Alexander Park, who plays Gren, tweeted back to Grillo-Marxuach with “A joy to work on this with you.”&#xa0;</p><p>https://twitter.com/MasonAPark/status/1469092342393151496?s=20Lead actor Cho simply tweeted a GIF of Tom Selleck saying, “I'm okay.”&#xa0;</p><p>https://twitter.com/JohnTheCho/status/1469099377298132992?s=20“Seriously, one of my favorite shows ever. It hit all the right notes and was so much fun,” mourned one fan on Twitter, who tried pitching it to rival streamers. “Maybe you can take it elsewhere for a continuation? Hulu? Apple? I don't know.”</p>",
