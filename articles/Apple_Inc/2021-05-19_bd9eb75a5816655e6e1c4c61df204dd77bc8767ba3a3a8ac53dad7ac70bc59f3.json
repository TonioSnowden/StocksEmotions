  "text": "<p>Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair on Wednesday scored its first partial victories at the EU's second-highest court against rival airlines propped up by state aid during the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Luxembourg-based General Court ruled the European Commission argued insufficiently why Portugal's TAP airline and the Netherlands' KLM carrier should receive state aid totalling €4.6bn back in June 2020.</p> <p>However, the court said in both cases, given the “particularly damaging impact of the pandemic”, the airlines did not have to pay the money back pending new decisions by the commission.</p> <p>Still, it marks a victory for Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who has succeeded for the first time in getting state aid decisions favouring rivals annulled in an EU court after filing more than 20 complaints.&#xa0;</p> <p>He has been a fierce critic of state support given to national flag carriers, which he said would not be paid back to governments in what amounted to subsidies and a suppression of competition. </p> <p>One of his other complaints was dismissed by the court, also on Wednesday. This was a challenge against Spain's state aid scheme for strategic non-financial companies set up in July 2020 and worth €10bn.</p> <p>Ryanair welcomed the court's rulings on the Portuguese and Dutch cases, saying the funding of those carriers “went against the fundamental principles of EU law and reversed the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport by rewarding inefficiency and encouraging unfair competition”.&#xa0;</p> <p>O'Leary argued support made available to flag carriers only was discriminatory and undermined the EU's single market in air travel.</p> <p>He has labelled carriers including Air France and KLM as state-aid “junkies”, but others in the industry argue the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ba22be6-20b8-4ee9-8441-7bcbb2488702\">support was needed</a> to help carriers survive an unprecedented collapse in passenger numbers.</p> <p>The commission said in both cases it&#xa0;would “carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps”.</p> <p>New and better-argued decisions in both would probably be issued by the commission, but there was no immediate urgency given the recovery of the funds had been suspended, said an EU official familiar with the matter.</p> <p>KLM said it had taken note of the judgment&#xa0;and would review&#xa0;it. “The decision of the General Court does not have any consequences for KLM and the aid it has received at this moment. The General Court has decided that the consequences of the annulment will be suspended,” it added.</p> <p>TAP said the decision “will have no immediate impact” on the state-aid granted to it.&#xa0;</p> <p>The court losses come after several high-profile defeats on state aid for the commission, notably on Apple <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c38fdc1-c4b3-4835-919d-df51698f18c4\">last year</a> and Amazon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/217debd9-cecd-458a-9107-eda81c3c94ac\">earlier this month</a>. </p> <p>In those rulings, the court found that the commission had not sufficiently proven how the tech companies benefited from alleged illegal state aid in Ireland and Luxembourg in the form of sweetheart tax deals.</p><p>Source: Valentina Pop in Brussels and Philip Georgiadis in London 2021 'Ryanair scores first wins in EU court against state-propped flag carriers' FT.com 19 May.
