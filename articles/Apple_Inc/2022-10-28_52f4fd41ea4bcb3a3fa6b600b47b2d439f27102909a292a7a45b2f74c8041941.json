  "text": "<p>   Carol Burnett, the iconic female comedian and actress, is listing her longtime Los Angeles home for $4.2 million. </p><p>   The three-bedroom unit is located in Westwood's Wilshire condominium, said listing agent Graham J. Larson of Sotheby's International Realty Pacific Palisades Brokerage. </p><p>   Ms. Burnett, 89, said she first moved into the building in the 1990s, purchasing a unit on the 25th floor. A few years later she decided to relocate to Santa Barbara with her husband, musician Brian Miller, and bought a 13th-floor unit for $1.26 million in 2002 to use as a pied-a-terre. </p><p>   \"We cut our commute in half,\" joked Ms. Burnett, referring to the shortened elevator ride to the 13th floor after living on the 25th floor. </p><p>   The roughly 2,800-square-foot condo, which they renovated in 2011, has walnut floors and stone countertops. The primary bedroom suite has dual walk-in closets and dual bathrooms with lighted mirrors. Two balconies offer views of the Santa Monica mountains and UCLA, where Ms. Burnett attended college, she said. One bedroom is used as an office, and there is a private elevator, said Mr. Larson. </p><p>   Ms. Burnett, who was raised in L.A., said she moved to the Wilshire from a single-family home in Century City because she wanted to live somewhere with a concierge service, front desk and valet service. She said she liked the building's community spaces, which she sometimes reserved to tape interviews and host holiday parties, she said. </p><p>   \"We were there for a long, long time. It's a beautiful building,\" she said, adding that she will miss the staff and her friends in the area. </p><p>   The couple decided to relocate to Santa Barbara after spending a summer there. They are selling the Wilshire pied-a-terre, she said, because \"we're not in L.A. much anymore. If we have to come to L.A. for a meeting, we can always stay in a hotel for a day or two.\" </p><p>   Ms. Burnett is best known for hosting \"The Carol Burnett Show,\" a variety show that ran from 1967 to 1978. She also played \"Miss Hannigan\" in the 1982 film \"Annie.\" </p><p>   Ms. Burnett, who has won six Emmy Awards, has recently appeared in AMC's \"Better Call Saul\" and is scheduled to appear in upcoming Apple Studios miniseries \"Mrs. American Pie.\" </p><p>   Condo sales in the greater Los Angeles area fell about 12.2% in the third quarter from the same period of 2021. Median condo sales prices in the area rose 26.7% in the same period, according to Sotheby's International Realty. </p><p></p>",
