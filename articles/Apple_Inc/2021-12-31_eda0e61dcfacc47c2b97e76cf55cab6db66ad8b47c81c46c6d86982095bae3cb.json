  "title": "Should you get an SUV or a minivan? Here's a mom's advice.",
  "text": "<p>Start this convo at moms' night out, and it can get pretty polarizing. As a mom working in the automotive industry, I've had this conversation with fellow parents so many times, and for good reason. Parents need particular things when it comes to toting their families around.</p><p>And even if you know absolutely nothing about cars, it's pretty apparent that SUVs and minivans remain two of the most efficient types of vehicles for hauling people and cargo. (One look at an elementary school carpool line will give that away.)</p><p>However, when you start to dig a little deeper, you quickly realize that these two options differ in price, style, features, and capability. That's why it's essential to truly understand the differences before picking the best vehicle for your family.</p><p>Choosing between an SUV and a minivan really depends on your budget, demands, and lifestyle.</p><p>Be sure to read: This popular family car has earned top-notch safety ratings</p><p>Similarities between SUVs and minivans&#xa0;</p><p>At first glance, you may not think SUVs and minivans have much in common, but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p><p>Interior technology</p><p>To start, both have excellent interior technology: Most current models have all the latest must-haves, like rear-seat entertainment systems,&#xa0;Apple AAPL CarPlay,&#xa0;Android Auto, and surround-view cameras, which is my favorite mom car feature of all time (game-changer for parking in a tight preschool parking lot!). And in today's connected climate, most SUVs and minivans also come with more than one rear USB port, which means more access for mom (and surly teens) to recharge mobile devices.&#xa0;</p><p>Safety technology</p><p>Since car makers designed both SUVs and minivans to be family-friendly vehicles, they usually come equipped with the most up-to-date safety technology. Features like lane-departure warning,&#xa0;blind-spot monitoring, and collision avoidance systems help give parents the peace of mind they need when hauling around their most precious cargo.</p><p>Both types of vehicles also tend to have decent driving performance and handling, and they typically have similar fuel economy and other costs.</p><p>So, if SUVs and minivans are that similar, how on earth does a mom decide between them? Read on to understand the differences and nuances of each vehicle type.</p><p>Minivan</p><p>Ask any mom the difference between an SUV and a minivan, and I guarantee the first thing she'll say is something about looks. Let's just address the elephant in the room and get it out of the way: Minivans do not look sleek or sexy.</p><p>See: The 5 best minivans for your kids, pets, travel and gear</p><p>There's a major stigma that still exists around minivans, and I know this because I talk to moms weekly about it. It's not unusual for me to hear a mom say, “You couldn't pay me to drive a minivan,” which I think has to do with the cool factor (or lack thereof) that comes with driving a perceived mom-mobile. My response is always the same: “I totally get it, but trust me when I tell you that one day behind the wheel of a minivan will completely change your mind.”</p><p>Minivan pros</p><p>Cost. On average, minivans cost less than&#xa0;3-row SUVs&#xa0;(of course, this doesn't include higher-end models), which is a definite check in the minivan column.</p><p>Space — and more space. Minivans typically offer more space than the average three-row SUV, with about five additional inches of legroom on average in the third row. That's a big deal if you have a large family, older teens, and/or typically drive around with multiple generations (you don't want grandma cramped in the back).</p><p>Accessibility. Now, let's talk about the number one feature that makes a minivan so amazing: sliding rear doors. Any mom with little kids knows the struggle of an independent toddler insisting on getting into the car all by himself…and 10 minutes plus a few gray hairs later, most moms would do just about anything to make that process quicker and easier. Enter the sliding door with a lower step-in height than most SUVs, giving you (and your tiny dictator) easy access to enter and exit the vehicle. That's helpful for&#xa0;grandparents&#xa0;or other family members with mobility challenges, too. And tight parking spaces are a breeze with that sliding door. Honestly, it's a huge plus that often gets overlooked.</p><p>User-friendly tech. Another plus for minivans is that interior technology tends to be more family- and passenger-oriented. For example, the&#xa0;Toyota Sienna&#xa0;offers a whopping seven USB ports. And the Chrysler Pacifica provides dual rear-seat entertainment touchscreens with a Blu-ray player, wireless headphones, and tons of cool apps, and educational games (my 3-year-old learned how to play solitaire in the Pacifica — no judging, please), all of which make road trips a million times more palatable. Finally, minivans typically have more cargo space than SUVs, especially with the seats folded down.</p><p>ChryslerMinivan cons</p><p>Minivans are sounding pretty good right about now. So why wouldn't you get one? We'll tell you about the cons — read on.</p><p>Ground clearance. First of all, they don't offer a whole lot of ground clearance compared with SUVs. They're also not great in extreme weather or off-road conditions, so you need to consider your typical driving environment and terrain.</p><p>Towing capacity. Another factor to consider is that the highest maximum towing capacity of any minivan is 3,600 pounds. So, if your family vehicle is required to tow a boat or a trailer, an SUV might be a better bet for you.</p><p>Size. Minivans are big vehicles with a large external footprint. I remember getting behind the wheel of one for the first time and feeling like I was driving a boat (that feeling does not last, FYI).</p><p>Fuel efficiency (with an asterisk). Most minivans are not particularly fuel-efficient, though there are two different hybrid minivan options on the market today (the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid and the Toyota Sienna).</p><p>TIP: Almost every minivan on the market is going through changes over the next couple of years. When a new model comes out, that's a great time to look at the previous generation, as dealers are typically more willing to discount older models.</p><p>But be aware: Minivans are literally the&#xa0;hottest-selling vehicles in America at the moment, so finding available inventory could be a challenge. Have patience, and start looking long before you actually need that new car.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: Fauci says the best way to protect kids is to make sure adults around them are fully vaccinated</p><p>SUV</p><p>Despite minivans' moment in the spotlight, more SUVs get bought in this country than cars and trucks combined. Moms are responsible for a large portion of those SUV sales.</p><p>If you have a smaller family (maybe just one or two kiddos), you might not need all that extra minivan square footage. A compact or midsize SUV could be the perfect fit for those families.</p><p>See: Cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans: 18 best buys </p><p>Alternatively, if you haul a huge crew, several full-size SUV options could offer up even more space than a minivan. And if aesthetics are nonnegotiable for you, you'll likely gravitate toward the overall sportier, sleeker look of an SUV.</p><p>SUV pros</p><p>More options. There are so many more SUV options on the market than minivans, giving parents seemingly endless (albeit slightly overwhelming) options for all budgets and lifestyles.</p><p>Hybrid and electric options. SUVs offer tons of different hybrid and electric options if that's of importance to you.</p><p>Better visibility. SUVs also tend to offer a taller ride height and higher ground clearance than minivans and stellar visibility, which can help moms feel more confident at the wheel.</p><p>Elevated safety features. You'll find that SUVs typically offer slightly elevated safety features beyond the typical crash avoidance systems. For example, the&#xa0;Toyota Highlander&#xa0;offers a gauge cluster seat belt indicator telling you who buckled up and who did not. This feature comes in handy so you don't have to rely on your testy tweens to tell you whether they buckled or not. Necessary? No. But certainly nice to have.</p><p>Tech amenities. SUVs also tend to offer interior tech amenities that are more focused on the overall driving experience. Likely not a mom's number one priority, but a smooth, comfortable ride is definitely a plus.</p><p>Handling. Another pro for SUVs is that they are available with either all-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, which means they'll have much better handling when on rough terrain or in stormy weather.</p><p>Towing capacity. If towing is a must for your family, some large SUVs surpass the towing capacity of even the best compact pickup trucks and can tow over 9,000 pounds, which means you can pull a much larger trailer or a large boat with ease.</p><p>ToyotaSUV cons</p><p>Less space. If space is top on your list of priorities, minivans hold more than 15 extra inches of space than the average 3-row midsize SUV. There's typically less overall cargo space with the third-row in use compared with a minivan.</p><p>Fuel efficiency. And SUVs are not very fuel-efficient unless you go with an environmentally friendly EV or hybrid model.</p><p>Bigger environmental footprint. In addition, SUVs require more resources to manufacture than smaller vehicles. This means that SUV production contributes to climate change and environmental degradation on a larger scale than other vehicle choices (unless you go with an electric SUV option, of course).</p><p>No captain's seats. If you're buying used, you're less likely to find an SUV with captain's seats than a minivan equipped that way. This is a significant factor for parents with more than one child in a convertible car seat (rear and forward-facing). Captain's seats are a must in this situation for access to the third row.</p><p>TIP:&#xa0;My number one piece of car shopping advice to parents with two or more small children in car seats is to avoid the second-row bench at all costs. Wait until at least one child is in a booster seat to go for the bench.</p><p>Read: The 2022 Kia Sorento Hybrid is great for families and starts below $34,000</p><p>Overall, SUVs offer a much wider scope of changes than minivans over the next couple of years. That means there will be many more older models with better deals to choose from. And SUVs tend to see technological advancements sooner than minivans, so if having the latest and greatest tech is important to you, or if you have off-road or towing needs, a 3-row SUV is probably your best bet.</p><p>SUV vs. minivan: the results</p><p>The bottom line? As a parent, you really can't go wrong with either a minivan or an SUV. You'll have plenty of space for kids and cargo, not to mention endless cup holders for mommy's daily caffeine fix. It all comes down to budget, lifestyle, aesthetic preferences, and priorities. As you narrow down your choices, I highly recommend asking for an extended test drive to see how the car in question works for your daily life.</p><p>Check out: Toyota's new electric SUV: Everything you need to know about the 2023 bZ4X</p><p>Install your car seats, park it in your garage, let your kids jump in and out…see how it feels to live with the car for a few hours, and you'll quickly learn whether or not it's right for your family.&#xa0;</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
