  "text": "<p>Wade is a three-time NBA champion, an entrepreneur and the author of the recent photographic memoir DWYANE.</p><p>Siri Hustvedt</p><p>\"The standard definition of wisdom often includes the accumulation of personal experience and knowledge, which then creates an ability to make good judgments. Wisdom is more than that. Wisdom really never develops in isolation but only in relation to other people, parents, teachers, family members and, of course, in relation to the broader culture that has hierarchies and values of its own. It's fundamentally rooted in an openness to dialogue. Martin Buber called it the 'between,' the area between people where something new is created. In our neoliberal culture where the 'me' is supreme, thinking about wisdom as something formed between people is really important. Truly wise people are always walking on some form of moral ground that recognizes the other person. That means having humility, both intellectual and moral.\"</p><p>Hustvedt is a writer. Her most recent book is Mothers, Fathers and Others: Essays.</p><p>Chris Meledandri</p><p>\"I've only made one movie with a truly wise character at the center of it, The Lorax, adapted from the Dr. Seuss book. There are movies where the wise character is very clearly identified, whether it's Gandalf or Obi-Wan, and their role is very straightforward. Then there are stories where wisdom is perhaps found in the more unexpected place—Mary Poppins or Willy Wonka. As much as I crave wise input, there's something in me that begins to shut down when it's being obviously given to me. I prefer it when it sneaks up on me or provokes me into engaging in a set of ideas, even actions. In order to be wise, one has to have a strong set of values. Those values obviously change from person to person, and that interrupts this idea that truths are universal. They're individual.\"</p><p>Meledandri founded Illumination, which produced Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets and Sing 2, out December 22.</p><p>Frances F. Denny</p><p>\"I spent three years traveling around the country photographing self-identified witches, and I've come away with the belief that wisdom is actually more about intuition and a kind of sensitive, intentional consciousness. For wisdom, the word that witches use is magic. There's a book by a witch named Starhawk called The Spiral Dance. In the book, Starhawk defines magic as awakening deeper levels of consciousness beyond the rational. Magic is not supernatural. It's human. It's natural. For me, photography is also a magical practice. You're translating a flesh-and-blood, three-dimensional human being into a single static frame, and that requires a lot of intuitive wisdom. It's happening in my fingers. Maybe that's a kind of witchcraft; maybe that's a kind of wisdom.\"</p><p>Denny is a photographer. She's best known for her book Major Arcana: Portraits of Witches in America.</p><p>Anthony Horowitz</p><p>\"I can't think of a writer who you would call wise. Shakespeare is the greatest writer who ever lived. Charles Dickens is a writer who I absolutely adore. But wisdom isn't the reason I go to them. I go to them for enlightenment, and they give me greater perception of the world. I am looking for knowledge, for empathy, for understanding. If I get those in a book, I consider it a great book. I do not come away reading a book with the sense of, 'Oh, my goodness; this book has given me wisdom,' because wisdom is something I don't really need. In fact, I would go further and say that all the wisdoms of my life have been upsetting. Santa Claus isn't real. My father wasn't perfect. I'm going to get old. I'm going to die. These are all aspects of wisdom, but they are not ones that I particularly celebrate.\"</p><p>Horowitz is a novelist and a screenwriter. His latest book is A Line to Kill.</p><p>Meagan Good</p><p>\"Wisdom is being able to discern how people are presenting themselves to you, what they really mean and then knowing how to download all that information. As I grew up, I always paid attention to the small things and was like, There's a part of me that possibly is wise beyond my years; there's a part of me that maybe thinks that I'm wise beyond my years. There are certain things I know about human beings and about the world that no one's actually ever taught me. I can just feel it, and I know it in my spirit. When I was a teenager, my godfather—Jim Brown, the football player–activist—and I were watching TV, and we saw a commercial about condoms. I knew everything in this commercial was very specific in its intent, in trying to get my attention. I told Jim this, and he was like, 'Well, good for you; knowing that is what wisdom is.' \"</p><p>Good is an actor. She currently stars in the Prime Video TV series Harlem.</p><p>These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Dwyane Wade: Retirement Really 'Opened Up My Mind to Life'</p>",
