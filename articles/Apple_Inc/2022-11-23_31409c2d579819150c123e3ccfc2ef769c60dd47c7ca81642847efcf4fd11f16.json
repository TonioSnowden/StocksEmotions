  "title": "The market is too optimistic about corporate earnings for 2023. Here's why. Critical information for the U.S trading day.",
  "text": "<p>However, anyone hoping for earnings growth even managing to be flat for 2023 \"is very naïve\", according to Peter Ganry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.</p><p>Ganry notes that the 12-month forward earnings per share estimate on the S&amp;P 500 is currently at $235.34 which is 7% above the expected full-year 2022 EPS of $219.38. That's too high, he reckons.</p><p>\"There is nothing unusual in this divergence conflicting with reality as sell-side analysts have a natural long bias…and are slow to react and incorporate new information. The fact that the 12-month forward EPS estimate on S&amp;P 500 is only 4% from its recent peak despite the ongoing margin compression says it all.\"</p><p>And indeed it is over-optimism on corporate margins that may trip up investors. It's important. As the chart below shows looking over a short time period such as one year, the changes in earnings are strongly associated with changes in the operating margin.</p><p>\"If you take EPS of $220 next year and divide with the expected revenue per share of around $1,800 which fits pretty well with a 1-year lag in US nominal GDP growth, then you get a net profit margin of 12.2% which exactly where the 12-month trailing net profit margin stood at in September,\" Ganry says.</p><p>That implies that S&amp;P 500 companies can maintain their net profit margin next year. That's \"a completely detached assumption\" for several reasons.</p><p>First, companies have been constantly talking about margin pressures in their Q3 earnings reports, particularly regarding wage pressures and also commodities and energy costs. Indeed, the growth of wages – typically the biggest cost for many companies – in the U.S. and Europe is running at its fastest pace in many decades.</p><p>\"High wage growth is difficult to offset in an inflationary environment when recent price hikes by companies have now reached a point where they are destructive for volume growth (Home Depot being a recent example of this),\" Ganry notes.</p><p>Next: \"The operating and net profit margin are both coming off historically high levels and margins are a mean reverting process, so this alone indicates that margins will trend down from current levels,\"</p><p>Ganry adds: \"The fact that the Q3 net profit margin in S&amp;P 500 is 11.9% (below the 12-month trailing figure) and trending lower suggests that margins are coming down faster than expected\".</p><p>Another downside risk to earnings per share in 2023 is that revenue growth could be lower than current estimates as nominal GDP growth is coming down to 6.7% annualised in Q3, down from the average 12.2% annualised in 2021.</p><p>Finally, the move higher in interest rates as the Fed continues to fight inflation will force up corporate financing costs. \"Not by much because only 20% of the outstanding debt is getting refinanced over the next 12 months, but it will still subtract from operating income before we reach EPS impacting the net profit margin.\"</p><p>\"If we are right about our operating margin call for 2023 then the impact on S&amp;P 500 will vary depending on the equity risk premium (P/E ratio), revenue growth and the actual net profit margin,\" says Ganry. The S&amp;P 500 is sensitive to these variables.</p><p>Markets</p><p>Markets are going into the holiday break on a subdued note.

When momentum has been dragging the index lower year to date, though, rest-of-year performance has been less positive. Again looking at years in which the index has fallen at least 10% headed into Thanksgiving week as is the case this year, positive returns through the end of the year have been less common only happening half the time with an average decline of 0.1%,\" says Bespoke.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker  Security name  TSLA    Tesla  GME     GameStop  AMC     AMC Entertainment  NIO     NIO  AAPL    Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  AMZN    Amazon.com  COSM    Cosmos Holdings  MULN    Mullen Automotive  APE     AMC Entertainment preferred  TSM     Taiwan Semiconductor</p><p>Random reads</p><p>T.
