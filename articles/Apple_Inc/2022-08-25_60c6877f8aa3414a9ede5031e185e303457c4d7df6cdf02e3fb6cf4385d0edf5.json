  "title": "SEC Whistleblower Awards Program Might Have a Revolving-Door Problem, Study Says; A legal researcher argues that a disproportionate share of awards is going to a concentrated group of \"well-connected, repeat players\"",
  "text": "<p>A decade after a forensic accountant raised red flags about Bernard Madoff's multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme to regulators who didn't listen, an entire industry is surfacing tips from company insiders and expert analysts who scrutinize corporate filings and submit them to the SEC for monetary rewards.</p><p>The SEC said it has awarded more than $1.3 billion to 281 individualsthrough the whistleblower program since 2011. The program, established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, gives whistleblowers between 10% to 30% of amounts generated through monetary penalties if their tips result in successful enforcement action and fines exceed more than $1 million.</p><p>Even though the SEC whistleblower award program has been applauded for its success in detecting and investigating potential wrongdoings, the private, unregulated industry of whistleblower attorneys may be distorting the program's goal to encourage more whistleblowing, a recent research paper by Alexander Platt, associate professor of law at University of Kansas School of Law, said.</p><p>The paper argues that a disproportionate share of awards is going to a concentrated group of \"well-connected, repeat players\" who may be using their connections to help their clients' claims. That could ultimately deter potential whistleblowers from coming forward, according to the working paper.</p><p>Using SEC data from awards issued between 2012 and 2020 that was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the study shows that about 23% of awards in the database—or 30—went to law firms with at least one attorney who was a former SEC official, highlighting the potential benefits that this group's connections might have.</p><p>Two-thirds of the total awards went to whistleblowers represented by lawyers, the study found. Within that group, about a quarter of them, or 22 awards, went to lawyers who previously won awards from the SEC. About one-third of the recipients in the database didn't have legal representation, the data shows.</p><p>Jordan Thomas, an attorney who helped establish the SEC whistleblower program and now at law firm SEC Whistleblower Advocates PLLC, is \"a single dominant 'revolver,'\" according to the study. Mr. Thomas, during his time working for law firm Labaton Sucharow LLP, was responsible for 10 awards in the study's database, accounting for about 20% of all the dollars awarded in the study, at about $152.6 million, the study said.</p><p>\"The commission shows no special preference or treatment for claimants who are represented by counsel, including counsel who were former SEC attorneys,\" a SEC spokesman said in an email. Mr. Thomas didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\"Tipsters represented by lawyers significantly outperform unrepresented ones, repeat-player lawyers outperform first-timers, and lawyers who used to work at the SEC outperform just about everybody,\" wrote Mr. Platt.</p><p>The SEC doesn't publicly name whistleblowers or identify cases when they announce a whistleblower award, or say whether the whistleblower has legal representation. Some whistleblower attorneys might publicize that certain awards went to their clients, without disclosing the names, as part of marketing the success of their efforts.</p><p>The chance of winning an award is slim, at less than 0.54%, considering the SEC has received a total of more than 52,430 tips between August 2011 and September 2021, according to data analysis by The Wall Street Journal based on the agency's annual reports.</p><p>Whistleblowers, sometimes high-level insiders, have been key to the regulator's enforcement actions. For instance, three unnamed whistleblowers who helped the regulator reach a $415 million settlement with Bank of America Corp. received a total of about $83 million in 2018.</p><p>Mr. Platt said the opaqueness of the process, such as a lack of disclosure about whether an attorney represented the whistleblower and how much fees the attorney charges, has created an uneven playing field. He said attorneys tend to charge high fees—up to 40% of the award amount—and without regulation on the industry, those fees can stay high. \"There are some reasons to worry…[the attorneys] are exploiting some special connections and access that only they have because of their prior roles,\" he said.</p><p>Oliver Budde, a Wall Street whistleblower now representing other whistleblowers at the Law Office of Oliver Budde, said the study's findings track with what he has observed in the field. \"It's worth looking into further,\" he said.</p><p>Some whistleblower attorneys rebutted the study's findings and questioned the motives of the study, including its funding. Mr. Platt said the study was exclusively funded by the University of Kansas School of Law.</p><p>\"The idea that there is this small cohort of whistleblower attorneys and advocates [controlling the SEC] is preposterous,\" Siri Nelson, executive director of Washington-based nonprofit National Whistleblower Center, said. With the SEC whistleblower program staff being overwhelmed with the number of tips they receive, whistleblower attorneys help individuals vet their claims and report to various agencies, she said.</p><p>With more agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network setting up their own cash-for-tips program, \"we need attorneys to help them reach out to the agency—it's intimidating, sometimes the whistleblower attorneys are the only ones holding their hands,\" she said.</p><p>Rebecca Katz, who leads law firm Motley Rice LLC's SEC whistleblower litigation team and has worked at SEC's enforcement division, said the study doesn't portray the industry accurately. She said the field is competitive and lawyers who market get more clients. \"I think the rotation from the SEC to the defense bar is a much bigger problem,\" she added.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>SEC Whistleblower Awards Program Might Have a Revolving-Door Problem, Study Says</p>",
