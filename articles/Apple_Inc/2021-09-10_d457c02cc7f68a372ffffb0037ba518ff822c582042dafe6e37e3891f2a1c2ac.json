  "title": "DoorDash, AMC Entertainment, GameStop: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>DoorDash Inc.</p><p>Food delivery companies bit back at the Big Apple. DoorDash, Grubhub Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.'s Eats division sued New York City over its law permanently capping the amount of commissions the apps can charge restaurants for services. The companies contend that the fee cap is harmful and constitutes government overreach that cost them hundreds of millions of dollars combined through July. DoorDash shares rose 1.3% Friday.</p><p>AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.</p><p>Moviegoers delivered a smash hit for AMC on Labor Day weekend. More than two million people watched films at the company's U.S. theaters in the four days leading up to the holiday, AMC said, and roughly 800,000 in Europe and the Middle East. Walt Disney Co.'s Marvel superhero movie \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" had a record debut that helped; AMC said the weekend was the first one with higher attendance than the same weekend pre-pandemic. The results marked milestones for the company, which like others in the entertainment sector had been hit hard by restrictions to help curb the spread of Covid-19. AMC shares soared 8.7% higher Tuesday.</p><p>Intel Corp.</p><p>Intel is powering up its chip production. The semiconductor maker said Tuesday it will build new chip-making facilities in Europe valued at up to $95 billion, responding to a cross-border race to add manufacturing capacity at a time of a global shortage. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said the company is planning two chip factories at the new site and could potentially expand it further. The facilities would cater to meteoric demand for semiconductors as items like computers and cars have become reliant on computer chips. Rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. have said they plan to boost spending on chip manufacturing. Intel shares rose 0.3% Tuesday.</p><p>Boeing Co.</p><p>The relationship between Boeing and its biggest non-U.S. customer hit new turbulence. Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday it walked away from talks with the U.S. jet maker over a potential new order for the 737 MAX in a dispute over pricing. The Dublin-based discount airline was in talks with Boeing over the past 10 months for a fresh order of 737 MAX 10s. Industry players were watching that order as another bellwether for how quickly Boeing can recover its order backlog after the model's nearly two-year grounding. Ryanair is Europe's largest carrier by passengers and has been a big buyer of the 737 MAX, buying 75 of the aircraft last year. Boeing shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.</p><p>GameStop Corp.</p><p>GameStop scored following a reset. The videogame retailer and popular meme stock on Wednesday narrowed its losses and posted sales growth of roughly 26% in the latest quarter, after an overhaul of its leadership team. While the fiscal second quarter is typically slowest for its sales, GameStop reported growth across its hardware, software and collectibles categories. In June, the company named former Amazon.com Inc. executive Matt Furlong as its chief executive officer, alongside fellow Amazon veteran Mike Recupero as finance chief. Shareholders also voted Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen as chairman. GameStop shares added 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</p><p>Wells Fargo's stagecoach hit a new ditch. One of the bank's top regulators fined the San Francisco bank $250 million for lack of progress in addressing longstanding issues in its mortgage business. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the lender had failed to fix problems it first identified in a 2018 order, in which the bank was found to have harmed home-lending customers by failing to develop a program for customers to avoid losing their homes. The newest penalty is a setback for Wells Fargo, five years after the bank first became embroiled in scandal for creating perhaps millions of fake customer bank accounts. Wells Fargo shares lost 0.1% Friday.</p><p>Coinbase Global Inc.</p><p>The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. faces new scrutiny from Uncle Sam. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Coinbase over a lending program the company plans to market and has indicated it would sue the company over the offering, Coinbase said Tuesday. The platform would allow customers holding a stablecoin called USD Coin to earn interest by lending it to other traders. Stablecoins are crypto assets that are supposed to maintain a peg to national currencies, such as the dollar. The SEC indicated the activity would constitute a type of investment that needs to be registered with the government under investor-protection laws, while Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong disputed this. Coinbase shares fell 3.2% Wednesday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>DoorDash, AMC Entertainment, GameStop: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
