The three taikonauts, as astronauts are known in China, have been celebrated as the country's space achievements dovetail with an era of heightened nationalism. </p><p>\n  Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo spent three months on the module that will form the core of its Tiangong space station. </p><p>\n  Tiangong is seen as China's answer to the International Space Station. For the past decade, China has been excluded by U.S. law from working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and its astronauts are barred from the space station. </p><p>\n  -- Natasha Khan </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  RUSSIA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Apple, Google Delete </p><p>\n  Opposition Vote App </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Facing Kremlin pressure, Apple and Google on Friday removed an opposition-created smartphone app that tells voters which candidates are likely to defeat those backed by Russian authorities, as polls opened for three days of balloting in Russia's parliamentary election. </p><p>\n  Russian authorities have sought to suppress the use of Smart Voting, a strategy designed by imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, to curb the dominance of the Kremlin-backed United Russia party. </p><p>\n  Apple and Google didn't respond Friday to a request to comment. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  SOUTH AFRICA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  High Court Upholds </p><p>\n  Zuma's Sentence </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  South Africa's highest court denied an application by former President Jacob Zuma to rescind his sentence of 15 months in jail for contempt of court in a ruling viewed as a stern test of the country's resolve to hold powerful figures to account. </p><p>\n  The Constitutional Court judgment upheld its own ruling that Mr. Zuma should go to prison for refusing to testify at a commission of inquiry into widespread corruption in government and at state-owned companies while he was president of South Africa from 2009 to 2018. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  LEBANON </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Firm Will Resume </p><p>\n  Central-Bank Audit </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Lebanon's incoming finance minister signed a contract on Friday with a New York-based company to conduct a forensic audit of the country's central bank, a key demand of the international community to restore confidence in the crisis-struck Mideast nation. </p><p>\n  Alvarez &amp; Marsal had pulled out of an earlier deal late last year, complaining that after months of work, the company was unable to acquire the information it needed to conduct its audit. The withdrawal was a blow to calls for accountability in Lebanon. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
