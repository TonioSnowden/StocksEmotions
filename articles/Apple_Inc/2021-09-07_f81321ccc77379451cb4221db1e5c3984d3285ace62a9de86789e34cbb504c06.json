  "title": "Apple announces event expected to launch new iPhones, stock heads for another record",
  "text": "<p>The company said the event will launch at 1 p.m. Eastern time and can be viewed at apple.com or on the Apple TV app. Apple's vice president of marketing also sent out the following tweet, teasing the event.</p><p>https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840?s=20That video, and reportedly an experience included with the invite sent to special guests, employs imagery that evokes mixed reality. Apple has been working on augmented and mixed reality technology for more than five years, with Chief Executive Tim Cook describing augmented reality in 2016 as “extremely interesting” and “sort of a core technology,” a message that the CEO has continued to give while Apple has yet to put out a device that truly takes advantage of the tech.</p><p>Previous reporting suggests that Apple will focus on camera upgrades for the new iPhones, particularly around video features. A report that Apple planned to include a satellite connection that would offer the ability to perform certain functions was watered down a bit by later reporting that said the function would more likely be for emergencies only.</p><p>Read: Apple's satellite phone plans are questioned, and space stocks are falling</p><p>Additionally, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Apple is working to include more health-related features its next Apple Watch, such as a blood pressure monitor and a thermometer to help with fertility planning.</p><p>The company last unveiled its iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max with camera upgrades in October.</p><p>Apple stock is on track to close at a record high, rising about 2%, following a record close of $154.30 on Friday. Shares closed at record prices three times last week, and Apple stock has gained 18.3% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA— which counts Apple as a component — has increased 15.6%.</p>",
