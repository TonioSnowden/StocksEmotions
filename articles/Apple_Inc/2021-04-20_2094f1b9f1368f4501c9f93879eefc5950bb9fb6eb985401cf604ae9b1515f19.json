  "text": "<p>Audio will be a “first-class medium” claims Facebook boss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac063d78-d3c9-4323-bfbf-d344e00f8150\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Private investors in audio-only app Clubhouse agree, quadrupling the San Francisco start-up's valuation to $4bn. Yet downloads are already collapsing. Investors should listen closely. </p> <p>The drop in demand is ominous. Between February and March, Clubhouse downloads fell 72 per cent, according to data from app analytics company Sensor Tower. Since late January, the app has gone from 28th most popular among US iPhone users to 410th.&#xa0;</p> <p>A combination of competition and familiarity are to blame. Clubhouse's life cycle is an accelerated version of other social media sensations. A couple of months ago the app created such a frenzy that a tiny company with a similar name saw its share price jump 1,000 per cent. Rivals scrambled to compete. Twitter made a bid for Clubhouse while working on a rival product. This week, Facebook and Reddit announced Clubhouse-alike audio rooms.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far, Clubhouse has reported no revenue. Its $4bn valuation, led by vocal fan Andreessen Horowitz, is based on rapid user growth. Weekly active user numbers jumped from 2m to 10m between January and February.</p> <p>Clubhouse remains small compared with competing tech groups. Most social media companies provide daily or monthly active user metrics, meaning Clubhouse evades exact comparisons. But the weekly figure is 0.5 per cent of Facebook's daily user count. </p> <p>Limited user numbers means limited revenue potential. If a tenth of Clubhouse users paid $10 to a popular creator each month and Clubhouse took a 10 per cent cut — similar to newsletter platform Substack's model — it might rake in $12m per year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whether users will pay is uncertain. Early users were mostly Silicon Valley workers with similar interests. As membership expands and conversation topics broaden, new joiners are less likely to find anything that grips them. User numbers will grow once an Android version of the app appears and the invite-only model is removed. But the app's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b3879b-f3bb-4138-a688-e3ed4179d45b\">real </a>enemy is boredom. </p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button ‘Add to myFT', which appears at the top of this page above the headline</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Clubhouse: $4bn valuation ignores downloads in freefall' FT.com 20 April.
