  "text": "<p>A friend told me he'd met by chance a former ambassador, an elegant gent who had spent decades navigating the complex world of international relations with aplomb. What was he doing now? Living in a cabin in Finland, he said. And how did he pass his days? His answer: “In summer I split wood, in winter I burn it.”</p> <p>Life, of course, is not that simple. Nor is burning wood.</p> <p>Once a necessity for survival, for western households with central heating it is now a luxury, one to be weighed up against our health and that of our neighbours and the environment.</p> <p>But a real fire remains one of the great pleasures, in particular over Christmas when the hearth of the household comes to life. So how do you light a fire responsibly?</p> <p>What follows is a gentle guide to how and why, from a practised pyrophile in my life in the countryside.</p> <p>First, those living in densely populated areas should follow local regulations. In the UK, only smokeless fuel or a Defra-approved stove that inhibits smoke is allowed. And with good reason: smoke particles build up in the atmosphere. It is not quite like 1952 when coal-fired London developed a smog so thick visibility was reduced to 1 metre. But as the popularity of wood burners rises, so too should one's sense of civic duty. And while on the subject, getting your chimney swept at least once a year matters.</p> <p>Second, your selection of fuel: there are briquettes available — compressed wood sawdust and chip — but the purist burns logs. For these, they need to buy dry either through seasoning — the traditional method — or kiln-dried — more expensive and, I think, a bit of a waste of electricity. Firewood should contain 15 to 20 per cent moisture. Drier than that and the log will frizzle away at a strike of the match. Wetter than that and it will be hard to light and burn dirty as it struggles to rid itself of extra moisture.</p> <p>There are new “Ready to Burn” regulations for firewood suppliers in the UK and moisture can be checked with a meter that costs about £20 — or, for an approximation, by knocking together two logs: a nice hollow “clonk” sounds means dry, a muddier sound and they should be set aside.</p> <p>That's how to square yourselves with the regulations.</p> <p>The next question is what sort of wood. This year ash will be plentiful, as many of those trees have been cut down due to ash dieback. It is great firewood, burning hot and strong at about 45 minutes per log. For more bespoke requirements, I'm very keen on cherry or apple for its aroma. Oak is dense and burns long and slow, good for the end of the night.</p> <p>A garage forecourt will probably have a lot of soft woods — pine or larch — or birch, with its craggy zebra-striped bark. These logs will often be cheap and burn fast. It is worth checking where this wood has come from. In the UK, you'd be surprised how much is shipped in from Baltic states.</p> <p>The final issue is what you do with these logs once you've got them. While the Scouts started with the tinder, the “logs first” approach is popular now because, again, it reduces smoke. To do it, lay down a bed of medium-sized logs and then place the kindling and tinder on top. I build a Jenga-like structure of kindling on three sides, with a hollow in the middle and a little roof. And on the open facing side, put in the tinder, newspaper, uncoated cardboard, or save those wood coffee stirrers.</p> <p>Then you need the fire starter. Kerosene-infused soaked blocks from the local supermarket will do (I say with a sneer). Wood and wool fire starters are better — and also help out sheep farmers who've little call for their fleeces these days.</p> <p>Or there's DIY. Round my neck of the woods in Gloucestershire, our resident forager and eco-intellectual Rosemary Swan comes back with a haul of birch polypore brackets. She dries out the fungi, chops them up into grape-sized pieces and rolls them in melted wax from old candles. A handful of those in the fire and whoosh — we're off.</p> <p>The Greek myth goes that fire was stolen from the gods at great personal pain to Prometheus — chained to a rock, his liver attacked daily by Zeus as an eagle. Prometheus suffered and in return, humanity received a gift.</p> <p>Fire saved us not just from the savagery of winter. Its radiated heat is a memory of summer sun and contentment. A 2014 study by medical anthropologist Christopher Lynn found that relaxing around an open fire reduces your blood pressure. Being able to light a fire and, in the 21st century, burn it cleanly is the mastery of dangerous and destructive flame into a beneficent thing.</p> <p>Despite thickets of legislation, real fires will endure because they represent the opposite of that: the art of simple pleasures. It would be a shame to lose that privilege altogether. So you'll burn wood responsibly this winter? Good. Now just wait until you find out how much fun it is to split it.</p> <p><em>Follow Joy </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joy_lo_dico?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@joy_lo_dico</em></a></p> <p><em>Luke Edward Hall returns on January 8</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Joy Lo Dico 2021 'Come on, baby, light your fire — how to burn wood responsibly' FT.com 15 December.
