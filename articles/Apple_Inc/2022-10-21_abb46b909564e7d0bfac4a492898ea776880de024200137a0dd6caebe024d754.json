  "text": "<p>Despite the obstacles, some spectacular rebounds have followed dramatic falls. Hello, Martha Stewart!</p><p>Steve Jobs was famously fired from Apple only to return and rescue the company. (Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might be hoping to follow in his footsteps as he weighs his aspirations to the title he resigned in July.) Few thought Adam Neumann, the hard-partying WeWork chief executive, would ever resurface after he was ousted in 2019 so the company could go public. This past summer, Mr. Neumann, flush with $350 million in venture-capital investment, launched a new real-estate startup.</p><p>In politics, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, after a stint in prison, appear to have real shots at second electoral chances. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her post eight years after her first tenure had ended with Democrats getting trounced in the 2010 midterm elections. Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark lost a bid for the state senate in Massachusetts in 2004 but rallied to win a congressional seat nine years later.</p><p>A common thread among them all: massive confidence (or, at least, the ability to overcome self-doubt).</p><p>A year ago Jamie Grant, mourning the early end of his tenure as CEO of the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert, Calif., knew he needed an attitude adjustment. He'd moved halfway across the country for what seemed like a dream job, only to clash with the board over long-term strategy. He was let go after 13 months.</p><p>\"It was truly lousy,\" he says. \"I was mopey and trying to figure out what had gone wrong. What I discovered—and it took some time; I didn't discover it in five minutes—is that it wasn't a good fit. And I felt better.\"</p><p>Mr. Grant says a friend, a professional hockey coach who's been fired many times, helped him realize that being pushed out wasn't necessarily an indictment of his skill. He's started an independent consulting practice and says business is so good that he's turned down C-suite roles at other theaters.</p><p>More executives are having to recover from swift goodbyes. The average duration of CEOs' tenures was trending down in the years before the pandemic, and ultrashort stays have risen sharply in the Covid-19 era.</p><p>Roughly 2% of CEOs who left their roles in 2019 lasted less than a year, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, which tracks executive departures. The rate jumped to 5.6% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021, as the pandemic compounded management challenges.</p><p>Don't feel too sorry for the flameouts. CEOs who are dismissed without cause often collect millions of dollars in severance packages. A public servant such as Ms. Truss, 47, is eligible to receive as much as £115,000 (about $129,000) a year for the rest of her life, thanks to Britain's Public Duty Cost Allowance.</p><p>For overachievers, the steepest cost of failure is not financial.</p><p>\"Psychologically, it can be the kind of thing that is so devastating that it could rip your entire career apart,\" says Jeff Cohn, a corporate-leadership adviser who helps private-equity firms select executives for portfolio companies, which are themselves unsentimental about yanking leaders. \"It really does depend on how you deal with it.\"</p><p>Few careers go unblemished, and big mistakes aren't always terminal. A decadelong study of 2,600 business leaders, published by the Harvard Business Review in 2018, found that 45% had suffered major setbacks such as blowing a large deal or getting fired. Among those who faltered, more than three-quarters still went on to become CEOs.</p><p>Mr. Cohn says the firms he advises actively seek executives who have experienced and—this is the important part—learned from disappointments.</p><p>Men generally have an easier time coming back from big failure than women do, says Brooke Skinner Ricketts, co-founder of Beyond Barriers, a women's leadership academy.</p><p>Women tend to be picked for top roles when a company is in turmoil, a well-studied phenomenon known as the \"glass cliff.\" Researchers from Germany and the U.S. found 62% of participants in an experiment chose a man to head a company that was performing well, while 69% chose a female candidate when the company was in crisis. Ms. Skinner Ricketts, a former chief marketing officer at Cars.com, says the phenomenon could apply to Ms. Truss, who inherited an economy mired in stagflation.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your tips for bouncing back from a tough point in your career? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Whatever the reason for a bad ending, a leader hoping for another shot needs to show humility and growth, says Jim Citrin, who leads the CEO practice of executive-search firm Spencer Stuart.</p><p>Yet humility isn't always enough, he cautions. He says he recently recommended a short-lived former CEO to a client who immediately dismissed the candidate as \"damaged goods.\" To even have a chance, ex-executives better be ready to answer pointed questions, he says.</p><p>\"We always ask: What happened?\" says Mr. Citrin. \"What could you have done differently? The ability to take responsibility—that's the key to recovering.\"</p><p>Write to Callum Borchers at callum.borchers@wsj.com</p><p>You Can Flame Out and Make a Career Comeback (Good News, Liz Truss!)</p>",
