Just look at the success of short-form video platform TikTok, which has about 1 billion monthly active, largely Gen Z, users who view it almost an hour a day on average.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you watch TV on your phone? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>But it isn't just younger people who enjoy the convenience of mobile viewing: 51% of Americans regularly use their phones to watch streamed TV, according to a September poll of 22,000 respondents by market research company Branded Research. \"Often at home now I find myself just watching on the phone when the TV is right in front of me,\" said Jennifer Foster, 45, a media company CEO who lives in Detroit.

They didn't. The service lasted barely eight months in 2020, partially because of the pandemic and Quibi's lame content, but largely because watching anything on your phone for more than three minutes is a miserable viewing experience.</p><p>\"When you can, you should always watch something on the format it was created for,\" said Travis Weir, a Los Angeles film editor who creates special features. \"If you're paying the subscription fee to watch something that is made to feel big and epic and absorbing, don't rob yourself of the full experience.\" The biggest phone screens on the market max out around 6.9 inches—which at one-sixth the average span of a home TV isn't nearly large enough real estate to enjoy all the details visual storytellers put into their creations. \"iPhone viewing is the bane of every cinematographer and sound designer because it squeezes all of the nuance from their work,\" said Isaac Rentz, a Los Angeles film director.</p><p>Phones are better left as an accessory to a TV so you can look up an actor's name, research who they are dating, and check Hinge to see if you can find someone similar. —Matthew Kitchen</p><p>Is Watching TV on Your Phone Futile?
