  "title": "Want millions more in retirement? This small investment tweak can make a big difference. The most important investment lesson of 2022",
  "text": "<p>The best investment lesson of 2022 applies to virtually all investors: You should have at least some percentage of your portfolio in a fund that owns small-cap value stocks.</p><p>It doesn't have to be a lot. As we'll see, even a small percentage held in small-cap value can make a very significant difference if given enough time.</p><p>By itself, this lesson isn't new. I've probably written at least two dozen articles and I've co-authored an entire book aimed at pointing out the long-term benefits of small-cap value stocks.</p><p>What's new is a table of data to emphasize my point.</p><p>As you probably know, small-cap value stocks represent ownership of relatively small companies that, for a variety of reasons, have stock prices that make them relative bargains.</p><p>The \"small\" in small-cap value means you're buying companies with huge growth potential. If you own hundreds or even thousands of these companies through a fund, you're almost certain to be in \"on the ground floor\" of whatever might become the Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL or Amazon AMZN of the next decade.</p><p>The \"value\" in small-cap value means you're buying these stocks at a discount price, based on their profits and measured by the price-to-earnings ratio. That's a smart way to invest.</p><p>Over the past 10 years or so, I've become increasingly convinced that — at least for most people — simpler portfolios are likely to be more successful than complex ones.</p><p>And fortunately, it's easy to add small-cap value to just about any portfolio. Over time, the rewards of doing so can be substantial without adding much risk. In some cases, a dash of small-cap value comes with virtually no additional risk.</p><p>To illustrate this lesson, I've put together a simple table, which you'll find below, showing the long-term historical effects of adding various percentages of U.S. small-cap value to the S&amp;P 500 index SPX.</p><p>The numbers are based on calendar years 1970 through 2021, a relatively long period that included all sorts of ups and downs in the economy and the market.</p><p>For each combination, the table shows the annualized return and three measures of risk: standard deviation, the largest drawdown (the percentage decline from a peak value to a subsequent bottom) and the worst 12-month period. </p><p> Small-cap value percent  0%      10%     20%     50%     100%  Annualized return        11.0%   11.4%   11.8%   12.7%   14.0%  Standard deviation       16.9%   16.8%   17.0%   18.2%   22.7%  Worst 12 months          -43.3%  -43.9%  -44.5%  -46.3%  -49.3%  Worst drawdown           -51.0%  -51.6%  -52.4%  -55.8%  -61.2%  Source: Merriman Financial Education Foundation</p><p>As I discussed in a previous article, only 0.5 percentage points of extra return can add up to $1 million or more over a lifetime in retirement withdrawals and money you can leave to heirs.</p><p>Adding just 10% in small-cap value to an S&amp;P 500 portfolio nearly achieves that, boosting the return by 0.4 percentage points. And yet the risk is virtually the same. Boosting the S&amp;P 500 with 20% in small-cap value doubles the additional benefit, with so little extra risk that it probably would never be noticed by most investors.</p><p>I've used the S&amp;P 500 as the base portfolio, mostly because it's well-known and easy to understand — and I believe most investors' equity portfolios at least roughly replicate that index of large U.S. stocks.</p><p>But you can add small-cap value to any other investment mix. Doing so, based on everything I know about the past, is likely to increase your long-term returns without adding a lot of risk.</p><p>So far we have discussed the rewards of adding small-cap value only in terms of higher returns. Those higher returns mean more money to spend in retirement.</p><p>However, my friend and colleague Chris Pedersen, director of research for the Merriman Financial Education Foundation, has concluded that those higher expected returns can provide an additional benefit: They can let retirees safely withdraw a higher percentage of their portfolios.</p><p>That's a double benefit: The higher percentage is applied to the higher portfolio balance.</p><p>To see how this might work, consider the following hypothetical scenario.</p><p>You and a friend each invest $500 a month into a retirement account for 35 years. Your friend's money is 100% in the S&amp;P 500; your investments are allocated 80% into the S&amp;P 500 and 20% into small-cap value.</p><p>After 35 years you and your friend are ready to retire. Based on the historical annualized returns in Table 1, your friend's account is worth $2.46 million. Yours is worth $3.05 million.</p><p>At a withdrawal rate of 4%, your friend has $98,565 to spend in his first year of retirement; you have $121,904.</p><p>That's a very nice bonus, and you could stop there, knowing you'll always be able to pick up the check when the two of you go to dinner.</p><p>But there's more. Even if you (wisely) add some fixed-income funds after you retire, if you keep 20% of your equity stake invested in small-cap value, you'll continue to have higher expected returns in retirement.</p><p>If you determined that this higher return would let you safely increase your withdrawals to 4.5%, that would give you $137,142 — an increase of 51% over your friend's first-year payout.</p><p>To most investors, I think that huge extra reward would be well worth putting up with the relatively minor increase in risk.</p><p>For readers who want to dig deeper into this whole topic, I've recorded a podcast: 10 reasons small-cap value can make you richer.</p><p>Richard Buck contributed to this article.</p><p>Paul Merriman and Richard Buck are the authors of We're Talking Millions! 12 Simple Ways to Supercharge Your Retirement.
