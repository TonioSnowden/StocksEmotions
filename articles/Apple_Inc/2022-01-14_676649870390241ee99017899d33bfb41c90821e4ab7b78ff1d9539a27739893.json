  "title": "U.S. News: Oath Keepers Head Gets Sedition Charge",
  "text": "<p>The case marks the first time the Justice Department has filed charges of sedition related to the attack and comes days after Attorney General Merrick Garland promised that prosecutors would charge anyone responsible for the Capitol riot \"at any level,\" not just those who breached the building. Mr. Rhodes didn't enter the building that day, but prosecutors said he directed his followers there, setting in motion the violence.</p><p>His lawyer, Jonathon Moseley, said he was on the phone with Mr. Rhodes on Thursday afternoon when agents showed up at his client's home in Granbury, Texas.</p><p>Prosecutors described the 10 other people as affiliated with the Oath Keepers. Counting the latest indictment, more than three dozen members or affiliates of the Oath Keepers and another far-right group, the Proud Boys, have been arrested in connection with the attack on the Capitol. The Justice Department has charged more than 725 people to date in the attack, in which supporters of former President Donald Trump overwhelmed police officers and flooded the building.</p><p>The Oath Keepers, created by Mr. Rhodes in 2009, attracted many members with military or law-enforcement backgrounds as the group gained attention from its involvement in Western ranchers' and miners' confrontations with federal agencies over land use. The group's credo is that members' loyalty is to the U.S. Constitution, not any local or federal leader. Mr. Rhodes said in 2013 he wanted to see a \"restoration of the militia in this country.\"</p><p>The seditious-conspiracy charges against Mr. Rhodes and the 10 others are distinct from the conspiracy charges levied against dozens of other defendants in the Jan. 6 investigation. Seditious conspiracy is a rarely used statute with a much stiffer penalty directed against those who conspire to use force to overthrow the government, impede its laws or seize its property.</p><p>A conviction isn't contingent on the conspiracy being successful and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though defendants rarely receive that. Mr. Rhodes is also charged with numerous other counts related to obstruction of an official proceeding, which could factor into any sentencing decision if he is found guilty.</p><p>Prosecutors say Mr. Rhodes and other members of the Oath Keepers used encrypted communications apps to coordinate a series of actions leading up to their actions on Jan. 6, including organizing into teams and amassing weapons in the Washington area.</p><p>Once protesters had breached the Capitol perimeter, prosecutors say, members of the Oath Keepers marched into the Capitol as a team in \"stack formation,\" a single-file military tactic. The group then split up, with half of the Oath Keepers headed for the U.S. Senate chamber while the other half set out for the House of Representatives on the other end of the Capitol building, according to the indictment.</p><p>Prosecutors allege the group headed for the House was searching for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had been evacuated from the chamber by her security detail when the breach began. The Oath Keepers who tried to breach the Senate side were repelled by law enforcement, the indictment says.</p><p>A further group of Oath Keepers that prosecutors called \"Stack Two\" breached the Capitol roughly 45 minutes later, they said, and tangled with police trying to guard the Capitol Rotunda in the center of the building. Police used chemical spray to maintain order, prosecutors say.</p><p>The Oath Keepers allegedly also had an armed \"Quick Reaction Force\" stationed at a Comfort Inn in Arlington, Va., and other locations just outside the capital. They were prepared to ferry weapons into Washington in support of Oath Keepers operations, prosecutors say.</p><p>Mr. Rhodes had been under investigation for his role in the riot since at least late April, when FBI agents surrounded him in unmarked vehicles in Lubbock, Texas, seized his iPhone and served him a search warrant.</p><p>U.S. sedition laws, dating to the early days of the Civil War when President Lincoln and Congress sought to punish armed resistance to the Union, have been used sparingly and not always successfully over the past 160 years. In 2010, the Justice Department leveled the charge against members of a Michigan-based militia group accused of plotting to kill a local police officer as part of a plan to spark an uprising against federal law enforcement. A federal judge in 2012 dismissed the sedition charge, citing a lack of evidence.</p><p>The indictment doesn't charge Mr. Rhodes -- a graduate of Yale Law School who briefly practiced law in Montana -- with directly participating in the actions the Oath Keepers took in the Capitol. But it details how he created numerous forums on encrypted communications apps like Signal to coordinate plans with other members of the group almost immediately after the November 2020 election, purchased weapons and other supplies to bring to Washington, and helped plan and coordinate Oath Keeper activities on the day of the attack.</p><p>\"We aren't getting through this without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit,\" Mr. Rhodes wrote to fellow Oath Keepers on Nov. 5, 2020, according to the indictment.</p>",
