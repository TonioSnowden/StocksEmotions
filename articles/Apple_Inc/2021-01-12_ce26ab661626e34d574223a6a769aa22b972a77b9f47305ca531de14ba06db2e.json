  "title": "Popular Online Communities  Push Stocks to Record Gains  ----  By Caitlin McCabe, Gunjan Banerji and Mischa Frankl-Duval",
  "text": "<p>   A new army of social-media-enabled day traders is helping propel stocks to records and turning companies into market sensations. </p><p>   As trading by individual investors boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, so has the popularity of online communities where they gather. Platforms including TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook and messaging platform Discord have become the new Wall Street trading desks. Individual investors gather to talk about hot stocks like Tesla Inc., boast of gains and commiserate about losses. </p><p>   These investors do more than just talk, though. They piggyback on each others' ideas and trades, helping fuel the momentum that has propelled some companies to triple-digit or bigger gains in 2020. </p><p>   \"People fall in love with [some stocks] and they get in these echo chambers, where they are all shouting, like, 'We're going to buy Tesla forever!' \" said Blake Bassett, a 31-year-old delivery driver who began trading several years ago. \"People post all day like it's a football game.\" </p><p>   And while online discussions among investors aren't necessarily new -- in the late 1990s, internet chat rooms dedicated to stocks helped sustain the tech-stock bubble -- social media is more widespread than ever before. That, meanwhile, has coincided with an industrywide move to commission-free trading, while most brokerage firms have made it easier to dabble in risky instruments like options. </p><p>   Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO Inc. are an example. The stock has received some of the most enduring interest from individual investors, joining the ranks of dozens of others, including fuel-cell company Plug Power Inc. and Tesla. </p><p>   Though hardly a household name, NIO is among the most searched stocks on Google. Video snippets under the tag #nio have accumulated more than 35 million views on the social-media platform TikTok, with many young investors encouraging others to buy shares of the company or questioning if it is the next Tesla. And the buzz is alive on Twitter, where it was mentioned nearly 6,800 times on a single day in November, up from about 100 mentions a day at the start of 2020. </p><p>   The excitement online has coincided with a rush of trading activity. NIO has been the second-most-actively traded stock in the U.S. market over the past year, with about 111 million shares changing hands on average each day, according to Dow Jones Market Data as of Thursday. That trailed only trading in Apple Inc., which has a market valuation more than 20 times that of NIO. </p><p>   NIO has been a more popular trade than even the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, one of the biggest ETFs tracking the broad stock-market index. Options volume tied to NIO has surged, with more than 10% of all activity recently stemming from individual investors, according to Trade Alert data. </p><p>   Fetching under $4 at the start of 2020, NIO's U.S.-traded American depositary receipts closed at a record $62.70 apiece Monday. Its market value of about $98 billion is well above that of General Motors Co. </p><p>   The chatter has persisted into the new year. NIO was the second-most-traded stock on Monday on the retail-trading platform operated by Fidelity Investments Inc., trailing only Tesla. And the trend was mirrored on Webull Financial LLC's platform last week. Part of the excitement stemmed from Democrats' unexpected U.S. Senate wins in Georgia, which some investors believe will give President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, a greater shot at achieving his clean-energy initiatives. </p><p>   The company's annual \"NIO Day\" on Saturday, during which the electric-vehicle maker unveiled its fourth production model, had also prompted enthusiasm among individual investors leading up to the event. </p><p>   The online buzz has enticed traders to pile in. Gavin Mayo, a 19-year-old student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said he typically spends one to five hours a day scrolling TikTok, YouTube and other platforms for ideas on what to trade while churning out video snippets to more than 60,000 of his TikTok followers. </p><p>   \"If there's some really good stocks out there -- usually people are talking about it,\" Mr. Mayo said, adding that he recently sold 100 shares of NIO for about a $1,600 profit. Now, he is staying away from shares of electric-vehicle makers because he thinks they have run up too far. He recently sold his position in Tesla, too. That stock has surged 748% in the past 12 months, a rally that has intensified over the past week. </p><p>   Social media is what drew Mr. Mayo to stocks in the first place at around age 13, when he said he saw millionaire penny-stock trader Timothy Sykes's account while browsing Instagram. Mr. Sykes has boasted of making a full-time job out of trading stocks. </p><p>   Not everyone is swept up by the hype, even if they, too, are part of the social-media stock-market debate. </p><p>   Determining the degree to which online chatter drives share-price movement can be difficult to quantify. But some researchers have found individual investors typically make the biggest impact on smaller, more speculative stocks. </p><p>   Some industry veterans warn social-media posts can inadvertently send too rosy a message about beginner trading. That can draw other newbies in. </p><p>   \"Everybody only posts the wins,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, a brokerage that is popular with younger investors. \"Nobody sends a selfie on Instagram when they just woke up after a bender. It's when they're having their first cocktail for the night and they're all done up. It's the same for day traders\" posting their profit and losses. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
