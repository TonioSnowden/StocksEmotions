  "text": "<p>The bar for earnings was set high last year as the global economy reopened from its pandemic-induced state. \"Fast forward to this year, and earnings are facing tougher comparisons on a year-over-year basis. Add in the elevated risk of a recession, still hot inflation, and an aggressive Fed tightening cycle, and it is of little surprise that the sentiment surrounding the current 3Q22 earnings season is cautious,\" said Larry Adam, chief investment officer for the private client group at Raymond James, in a Friday note.</p><p>\"We have reason to believe the 3Q22 earnings season will be better than feared and could become a positive catalyst for equities just as the 2Q22 results were,\" he wrote.</p><p>Read: Stocks are attempting a bounce as earnings season begins. Here's what it will take for the gains to stick.</p><p>Better-than-feared earnings were credited with helping to fuel a stock-market rally from late June to early August, with equities bouncing back sharply from what were then 2020 lows before succumbing to fresh rounds of selling that, by the end of September, took the S&amp;P 500 to its lowest close since November 2020.</p><p>The past week saw the number of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises increase, noted John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, in a Friday note.</p><p>But the data doesn't give bulls that much to work with. Even with that improvement, earnings beats are still running below long-term averages.</p><p>Through Friday, 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 had reported third-quarter results. Of these companies, 72% reported actual earnings per share, or EPS, above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 77% and below the 10-year average of 73%, Butters said. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 2.3% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.7% and below the 10-year average of 6.5%.</p><p>Meanwhile, the blended-earnings growth rate, which combines actual results for companies that have reported with estimated results for companies that have yet to report, rose to 1.5% compared with 1.3% at the end of last week, but it was still below the estimated earnings growth rate at the end of the quarter at 2.8%, he said. And both the number and magnitude of positive earnings surprises are below their 5-year and 10-year averages. On a year-over-year basis, the S&amp;P 500 is reporting its lowest earnings growth since the third quarter of 2020, according to Butters.</p><p>The blended-revenue growth rate for the third quarter was 8.5%, compared with a revenue growth rate of 8.4% last week and a revenue growth rate of 8.7% at the end of the third quarter.</p><p>Next week's lineup accounts for over 30% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization, Adam said. And with the tech sector accounting for around 20% of the index's earnings, reports from Visa Inc. V, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Apple Inc. AAPL will be closely watched.</p><p>Earnings Watch: Big Tech has been an earnings refuge for years, but safety is no longer a sure thing</p><p>* Check out: Apple earnings: What do the iPhone production reports really mean?</p><p>* Amazon earnings: 'The good news is the consumer is still spending.

Ultimately, the broader based and better the forward guidance, the higher the confidence in our $215 S&amp;P 500 earnings target for 2023,\" Adam said.</p><p>The soaring U.S. dollar DXY, which remains not far off a two-decade high set at the end of last month, also remains a concern.</p><p>See: How the strong dollar can affect your financial health</p><p>\"While the degree of the impact depends on the blend of costs versus sales overseas and how much of the currency risk is hedged, a stronger dollar typically impairs earnings,\" Adam wrote.</p><p>Stock-market investors brace for busiest week of earnings season.
