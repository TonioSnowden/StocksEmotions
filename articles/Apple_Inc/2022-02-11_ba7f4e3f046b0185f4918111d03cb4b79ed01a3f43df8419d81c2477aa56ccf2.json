  "title": "Shareholder Voices Poised to Grow Louder With SEC's Help; The regulator scrapped some mechanisms companies use to shoot down shareholder proposals, giving nonexecutives a megaphone on social and other issues",
  "text": "<p>As environmental, social and governance issues gain more prominence, the SEC's move allows shareholders to shine an unwelcome spotlight on U.S. corporations as they head into the busy proxy season, the time between mid-April and mid-June when many public companies hold their annual meetings.</p><p>The SEC's guidance change \"was unexpected by the corporate bar,\" said Stephen Quinlivan, a partner at law firm Stinson LLP who advises companies on SEC reporting matters. \"If you represent public companies, your first reaction was to throw up your arms and say, 'How can they do this?'\"</p><p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, a Democrat tapped by President Biden, said when the change was announced, \"The right to put proposals in front of other shareholders for a vote is an important part of the securities laws.\"</p><p>Public corporations have for decades faced shareholder proposals, requests from investors that are voted on at a company's annual meeting. Executives say the proposals can be distracting, time-consuming and costly.</p><p>Companies can normally exclude proposals that touch too closely on their ordinary business, the logic being that management is better equipped than shareholders to solve day-to-day issues. But the SEC in its revised guidance said that shareholder proposals touching on major social issues that \"transcend\" normal business can't be excluded.</p><p>The SEC also said it would be less ready to accept company arguments that shareholder proposals constituted impermissible \"micromanagement.\"</p><p>The changes mean that shareholders have a new avenue to scrutinize and potentially influence companies.</p><p>It is too early to tell how the SEC might apply its more permissive guidance, Mr. Quinlivan said. But the latest proposals suggest some issues companies might face.</p><p>The SEC-permitted proposal directed at Apple, for example, highlighted a persistent area of concern: the extent to which companies have sought to handle sexual-harassment complaints by pushing employees into closed-door sessions.</p><p>The Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would bar companies from forcing employees and customers into arbitration to address claims of sexual assault and harassment. The House passed its own version of the bill and the legislation now heads to President Biden's desk.</p><p>An Apple spokesman said the company didn't have anything to add beyond what it said in its proxy statement, which contains the proposal along with a recommendation from Apple to vote against it.</p><p>Other proposals similarly touch on thorny topics. The proposal directed at Disney comes from a shareholder—the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank—which argued that the company's antiracism training discriminates against white employees. The SEC rejected Disney's arguments that the proposal could be excluded from its proxy statement. Disney didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The SEC similarly said Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. couldn't exclude a shareholder proposal from the Nathan Cummings Foundation that asked the company to set broad emission-reduction targets. The foundation withdrew that proposal after receiving certain commitments from Air Products, said Laura Campos, a director at the foundation. Air Products didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Yelp Inc., a platform for business reviews, has sought to scuttle a proposal from a shareholder that says the company doesn't do enough to counter false reviews targeting Planned Parenthood clinics and wants the board to order a harm assessment. The SEC hasn't yet issued a decision on the proposal. A Yelp representative said the company actively engages with shareholders and only would seek to exclude a proposal after \"careful consideration.\"</p><p>The full impact of the regulatory shift will be seen in coming weeks as SEC staff sift through companies' requests to exclude shareholder proposals and issue their opinions, said Sonia Gupta Barros, who chairs the public company advisory group at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. The SEC has dozens of requests to review.</p><p>\"This was a really significant shift,\" Ms. Barros said. Some companies have looked at the new guidance and decided not to fight shareholders on resolutions they might have contested in the past, she added.</p><p>Even before the SEC guidance change, companies were getting more social and environmental proposals. An analysis from law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP found that social-related shareholder proposals rose 37% in the 2021 proxy season from the previous year, while environmental-related proposals increased 13%.</p><p>Votes on shareholder proposals are almost always nonbinding. But they can draw attention, including from investors interested in ESG issues who might push for change, Mr. Quinlivan said.</p><p>For example, BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, said in a report that during last year's proxy period, it voted to back 64% of shareholders' environmental proposals and 35% of social proposals put forward to companies in which BlackRock held stock.</p><p>Though corporate executives often don't welcome shareholder intrusions, some investors think that companies, owing to their social and economic heft, should expect to weather periodic scrutiny.</p><p>\"The norms of corporate behavior have improved because of shareholder input,\" said Blaine Townsend, head of sustainable investing at investment firm Bailard Inc. \"In my mind, they're big enough, sophisticated enough, smart enough and the stakes are high enough; they should be able to field some of these questions.\"</p><p>Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com</p><p>Shareholder Voices Poised to Grow Louder With SEC's Help</p>",
