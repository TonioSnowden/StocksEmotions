  "text": "<p>Q: I love my car, but I hate its dated stereo. How hard is it to replace?</p><p>A: Easier than you might think! It should take you less than an afternoon to install a new receiver that will not only let you connect your phone through Bluetooth, but also support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto software so you can easily use communication and navigation apps safely while driving.</p><p>Aftermarket receivers almost always come in one of two universal DIN sizes. (The three letters stand for \"Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung,\" a German organization that established car radio sizes.) Single DIN stereos, which are becoming less common, are about 7 inches wide and 2 inches tall. Double DIN stereos are the same width, but two inches taller, accommodating a bigger screen. It should be pretty obvious which one your car uses, but you can use the \"Fit My Car\" tool from auto-parts retailer Crutchfield to double-check.</p><p>The Pioneer AVH-W4500NEX ($900) is expensive, but worth it. It's got a huge, responsive touch screen, almost 7 inches diagonally, that makes interacting with the CarPlay and Android Auto menus simple and snappy. What's more, thanks to its Wi-Fi feature, you can use these without plugging your phone into your car via USB. Sounds like a minor perk, but you'll appreciate it on marathon errand days when you're constantly getting in and out of your auto. The receiver also plays DVDs and even lets you stream videos from YouTube through a software called WebLink. For obvious safety reasons, you can only take advantage of this when your car is parked.</p><p>If you have a single DIN stereo, you might think your options are limited to slim receivers without screens of any significant size. You'd be wrong. Several receivers have screens that pop-out from inside the dash when in use, and retract themselves when not. In fact, if you do have a single DIN stereo, you might be able to get an even bigger screen. The Alpine Halo9 iLX-F509 ($1,200) has wireless CarPlay and Android Auto support and a gargantuan 9-inch touch display. It weirdly lacks the ability to play CDs, but when was the last time you listened to one of those anyways?</p><p>There is, of course, a cheaper solution that won't require you to get out your toolkit. Just grab a phone mount and a Bluetooth FM transmitter. The mount will position your phone so you can glance at it without taking your eyes off the road and the transmitter will let you listen to audio through your car's speakers. If you have a new iPhone that's compatible with iOttie's MagSafe chargers, try a mount from iOttie's Velox line (from $30). As for the transmitter, you could try the Anker Roav SmartCharge ($30), which is designed with a USB port right on its face. But you'll likely be just as happy with anything you can find at your local drug store. It's pretty simple tech.</p><p>Having a life problem only a new gadget can solve?
