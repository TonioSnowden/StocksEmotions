Celebrating the bounty of the American Midwest and her family's farming heritage with fastidiously sourced ingredients.</p><p>\"I really love pork,\" said Karyn Tomlinson. At her Minnesota restaurant, the chef usually serves chops bone-in. But here, for her final Slow Food Fast contribution, she takes a more home-cook-friendly route, pairing boneless pork chops with a warm radicchio and apple slaw that turns the dish into a complete autumnal celebration.</p><p>The radicchio is first dry-seared in a hot pan, then sliced while still warm and tossed in a punchy mixture of maple syrup, coarse mustard and red wine vinegar. Tart apple slivers and sauteed shallot lend textural contrast and a hit of freshness.</p><p>While boneless chops are easy to work with, they can turn tough if not handled deftly. To keep them tender, sear gently and make sure their internal temperature doesn't creep above 145 degrees. \"Otherwise,\" Ms. Tomlinson cautioned, \"the outside will dry as the inside cooks.\" That precision pays big dividends: blushing and juicy pork that plays perfectly off the piquant seasonal salad.</p><p>â€”Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of 'Slow Fires' (Clarkson Potter)</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Share your experience with this recipe.
