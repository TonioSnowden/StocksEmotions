  "text": "<p>• Humans invent sticks to capture wider selfies.</p><p>• Humans invent little flying cameras to hover in front of them, because selfie sticks just weren't cutting it.</p><p>The $230 autonomous Snap Pixy is the latest of those little flying cameras, from the company behind the Snapchat app. It's either a watershed moment in the struggle to overcome the anatomical restrictions of taking pictures of ourselves, or just a wacky toy. Either way, the Pixy is something totally new.</p><p>Unlike most recreational drones, the Pixy isn't controlled via an app. It launches from your hand then hovers in front of you to capture video or photos. When it's done with its brief flight, it returns to your palm.</p><p>\"This basically is an experiment that ended up way better than we expected,\" Snap Inc. Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel told me, adding that the company will be selling only a limited quantity of them starting Thursday.</p><p>You don't need to be a Snapchat power user to find the Pixy intriguing. While it is designed to work with the popular social-media app, you can easily grab photos and videos and post them elsewhere. It isn't the best quality footage, but the perspectives the Pixy captures are pretty cool. </p><p>The Pixy hovers in the air, left; a photo taken with the Pixy.

Here are some answers.</p><p>How do you fly this thing?</p><p>Turn the Pixy's dial to one of its four flying modes, hold the drone at eye level in your palm, press the button and, boom, takeoff! The hardest part is picking the mode: </p><p>Spin the dial to select one of the Pixy's four flight modes.

In the Snapchat app, you can customize, up to 60 seconds, how long you'd like it to capture video. (This is the best, safest setting for indoor selfies.)</p><p>• Reveal: Like a traditional drone shot, the Pixy reverses and flies upward to reveal your scene. My favorite of the bunch, it won't fly more than 30 feet away from you (you can shorten that distance in the app) and it only goes about 15 feet up in the air. Just be careful not to launch it in front of a tree. When I did have a midflight collision, the Pixy landed on the ground, unscathed.</p><p>• Follow: The Pixy will follow you around very, very slowly. More for Snapchatting tortoises than Snapchatting hares, it struggled to keep up with my casual walking speed while staying centered on me.</p><p>• Orbit: The Pixy will reverse to 5, 8 or 15 feet (whichever you set in the app) then make a full circle around you before flying back. Again, make sure there are no obstacles, like your 4-year-old son. Mine kept attempting to chase it. Again, the Pixy survived.</p><p>How does the tech work?</p><p>There are two cameras on the Pixy: One points down, stabilizing the drone and detecting your hand, aka its landing pad. The other faces outward, tracking you and capturing video and photos. Flight patterns are preprogrammed so it doesn't rely on any additional sensors for navigation or collision avoidance. Hence the trees.</p><p>How does the video look?</p><p>The 2.7K-resolution video—better than HD, not as good as 4K—isn't horrible, but smartphone-camera footage is better. For many shots, I wondered why I wouldn't just set my phone up with a tripod and a timer. Everything looks compressed and a bit grainy, even in good lighting.</p><p>Of course, Snap expects people to watch on small phone screens. The Snapchat app, which receives the footage quite fast via Bluetooth, has a new auto-crop tool that takes the Pixy's native horizontal video and turns it vertical for posting to a story. There are also new fun effects for the drone footage, including my favorite where you can clone yourself.</p><p>It's so small and cute!</p><p>OK, that's not a question but it is the most frequent reaction. The Pixy weighs a quarter-pound, a bit heavier than a 40-count bag of Pixy Stix candy, and can fit in a cargo-pants pocket. (Or it should. I didn't test that because, well, I'm not my dad.) Snap includes a funny little bumper and carrying strap so you can wear it like a purse if you so choose.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you buy a Snap Pixy? Why or why not?</p><p>It's so small it's hard to imagine people getting hurt by this if it flew into them. It isn't a flying lawn mower, but I wouldn't want my finger, or my kid's finger, to get pinched.</p><p>There are downsides to that size. More kite than copter, this thing doesn't fare much better than a plastic bag when the breeze picks up. Snap says it's best flown when wind speeds are below 7 mph. Even then, in some situations, the Pixy would drift to the side or struggle to stay at eye level.</p><p>A competing minidrone, the $150 AirSelfie Air Neo, is even lighter and struggled with a light breeze. Its camera quality wasn't great either. </p><p>The AirSelfie Air Neo, right, is similar to Snap's Pixy in that it hovers in front of you. PHOTO: Lanna Apisukh for The Wall Street Journal (2)</p><p>Then there's the Pixy's battery life—or lack thereof. Snap says you should get five to eight flights per battery charge with the default settings, but I was lucky to get four when I changed settings. At least the battery is replaceable. I burned through eight one afternoon. You can buy extra batteries for $20 apiece, or a dual-battery charger (with two batteries) for $50. </p><p>The Pixy runs on a small battery that lasts only a few flights per charge, but can be swapped. Extras cost $20 apiece. PHOTO: Lanna Apisukh for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>So is it a drone?</p><p>Snap likes to call the Pixy a \"flying camera.\" The Federal Aviation Administration likes to call it a drone.</p><p>Since it weighs less than 250 grams, you don't have to register it for recreational use. However, the FAA's operational rules still apply. That means abiding by local, state and federal flying regulations. So no national parks. Before flying anywhere, even near you, you should check the FAA's B4UFly app. It also means you have to take an operator's test. (I passed!) </p><p>The Pixy landed in the bushes after a light collision with a tree. PHOTO: Lanna Apisukh for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Should I buy it?</p><p>Between takeoff and landing jitters, the abundance of trees pretty much everywhere and, yes, the aforementioned FAA regulations, I've long been scared to pilot a drone. With the Pixy, that fear of flying is gone.</p><p>When I asked Mr. Spiegel why I'd use a Pixy versus my iPhone 13's great cameras, he replied, \"This gives you a totally different perspective. It includes you and the world.\"</p><p>Having now captured some really fun Pixy shots of me and my kids, I agree it does something a stationary camera can't. But generally I don't check wind speed when packing my family up for a trip to the park. And I stopped wearing a fanny pack full of batteries at least two iPhone generations ago.</p><p>The Pixy may be the future of the selfie but it needs to work on itself-ie first.</p><p>(I deserve to be hit in the head with a mini-drone for writing that last line.)</p><p>— Sign up here for Tech Things With Joanna Stern, a new weekly newsletter.
