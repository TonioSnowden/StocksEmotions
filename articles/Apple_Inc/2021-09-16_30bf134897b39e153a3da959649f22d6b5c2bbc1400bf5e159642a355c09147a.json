  "title": "Goodbye power polo: Elizabeth Holmes changes up her look for court",
  "text": "<p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has long understood the power of a uniform. Her wispy blonde chignons and Steve Jobs-inspired black polo necks, typically paired with a black blazer and trousers, are so recognisable that they remain popular on the American Halloween costume circuit six years after reports first emerged that her revolutionary blood-testing technology might be a fraud.</p> <p>Holmes is now on criminal trial in San Jose, California, on charges that she misled investors and patients about the accuracy of her company's finger-prick testing. Court proceedings seem to have claimed an early casualty as Holmes has dropped her black polo neck in favour of a blue blazer, knee-length skirt and soft white blouse, her hair falling in gentle waves. Has this scandal transformed the power polo into the toxic turtleneck?</p> <p>Holmes is not the first person to want to project a different persona during a trial by altering his or her appearance — see the “Soho Grifter” Anna Sorokin's shift away from ritzy labels and an enfeebled Harvey Weinstein's walking frame. With a possibility of a prison sentence, it is unsurprising that the Stanford dropout welcomes any chance to distance herself from her Silicon Valley wunderkind image. In the words of Oscar Wilde, “In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.” </p> <p>Her new look projects the middle management everymom rather than the biotech genius. (Holmes gave birth last month, and showed up to jury selection toting a Freshly Picked diaper bag.) But there is little chance of anyone forgetting what she used to look like. On the first day of the trial, three “fans” outside the San Jose courthouse were photographed having dressed a la Holmes and two even had their hair in the old Holmes manner. </p> <p>For a while, the highly identifiable look worked well. When she began publicly promoting Theranos's technology in 2013, her look was a gift for art directors. Forbes was just one of many magazines that made use of the stark, architectural impact of the monochrome polo neck on its covers, and which took on an almost Chanel-like poise when paired with a white lab coat on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek.</p> <p>Plus, there was the link to that other wunderkind wearer of black rollnecks, the late Steve Jobs, who wore his Issey Miyake versions every day. When worn by a woman in the world beyond Palo Alto the look is, of course, culturally freighted with the politically and intellectually engaged Left Bank moodiness of Juliette Gréco. Simultaneously sexy and serious, the power polo has been duly exploited by generations of stylish women: Jackie O, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn.</p> <p>Successful businessmen have often recognised the importance of a style signature, from Richard Branson's shaggy hairdo to Gianni Agnelli's watch strapped outside his shirt cuff. Unless testifying before Congress, an occasion for which he does manage to put on a suit, Mark Zuckerberg's go-to garment is the grey T-shirt.</p> <p>“I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community,” he said of the choice at a public Q&amp;A at Facebook's headquarters in 2014, echoing earlier remarks Barack Obama made about his steadfast rotation of navy suits during his presidency. (Joylessly disdaining an interest in clothes in order to pursue lofty ideals is a part of the plausibility playbook. Someone really ought to write a guide called “Dressing Down for Success.”)</p> <p>Holmes, however, knew that she would look way better in a black roll neck than a grey tee. “My mom had me in black turtlenecks when I was, like, eight,” she told Glamour in 2015. An alternative version is supplied by <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a26946867/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-black-turtleneck-ana-arriola/\">Elle</a>, which credits Ana Arriola, Theranos's former chief design architect, with guiding Holmes towards her distinctive corporate look.</p> <p>But whether inspired by parent, co-worker or both, Holmes was able to look good while portraying herself as far too high-minded to give too much thought to her wardrobe.</p> <p>“I probably have 150 of these,” she told Glamour. “[It's] my uniform. It makes it easy, because every day you put on the same thing and don't have to think about it—one less thing in your life. All my focus is on the work. I take it so seriously; I'm sure that translates into how I dress.”</p> <p>Ultimately it will take more than an alleged high stakes grifter to kill off the power polo neck. As a garment it is simply <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5efc1006-fdb9-4e35-8bff-ad8f3e34a99f\">too useful and too versatile</a> for women and men alike. That said, Silicon Valley biotech entrepreneurs might be advised to stick to crew-neck jumpers for some time.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Nicholas Foulkes 2021 'Goodbye power polo: Elizabeth Holmes changes up her look for court' FT.com 16 September.
