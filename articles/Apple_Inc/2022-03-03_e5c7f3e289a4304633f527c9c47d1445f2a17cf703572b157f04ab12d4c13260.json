The smartphone is expected to come with 5G capability, a cellular standard already available on its other phones that holds the promise of ultrafast connectivity, the analysts said. This includes better quality of streaming, video chats and other uses.</p><p>During the pandemic, the company has turned to virtual events for its new product launches.</p><p>In September, Apple revealed the iPhone 13 and a new smartwatch.
