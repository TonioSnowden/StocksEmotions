  "text": "<p>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that's changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Grand Central Oyster Bar in New York.</p><p>THEN</p><p>WHEN IT opened in 1913, as the main dining room for the city's new Beaux-Arts transportation hub, what we know today as the Grand Central Oyster Bar was baldly dubbed the Grand Central Terminal Restaurant. Its name was the only prosaic thing about it. Persian carpets covered the floors, cane-backed chairs stood at tables draped in white linen, and a ceiling of vaulted canopies inlaid with sand-hued tiles glistened above electric chandeliers. The sprawling subterranean space dazzled diners arriving or leaving on the Wolverine, the 20th Century Limited and hundreds of other trains that chugged in and out of Grand Central every day. Over the decades the Persian rugs were tossed, the white linen gave way to red-and-white checks and diners sat elbow-to-elbow at counters that displaced many of the tables. Well into the 1960s, deals were sealed in the clubby (and quieter) adjoining Saloon, over lunches of dry martinis and silken oyster pan roasts. But by the early 70s, rail travel was in rapid decline, and the Oyster Bar along with it: The ceiling tiles were darkened from time and neglect, aqua contact paper covered the marble pillar bases, and plastic fish festooned fishing nets that hung from the ceiling. On the last day of July 1974, the Oyster Bar closed. Later that year, restaurateur Jerome Brody takes the helm and the restaurant reopens.</p><p>NOW</p><p>FROM THE LOOKS of it, you'd never guess that the Oyster Bar has survived two global pandemics, dodged the wrecking ball and risen from the ashes of an inferno. It reopened in late September after being closed for almost 18 months of the pandemic. The burnished wood paneling still casts a welcoming glow, the main counter and its 23 leather stools run along the same wall they did when steel baron Charles M. Schwab sat there, and the tiled ceiling—completely restored in 2014—sparkles. The air is cleaner than it was in the days when people smoked between courses, but still perfumed with hints of Worcestershire, chili sauce and brine. The menu has seen some recent abridgments. \"The cost of products has gone up dramatically because of Covid,\" said executive chef Sandy Ingber, who has worked at the Oyster Bar for more than 30 years. Casualties include the lobster roll and fried clams. The combination pan roast remains, along with at least 12 varieties of oysters, fresh fish and crab cakes, which Mr. Ingber said are flying off the menu. \"At $40 a plate I'm just breaking even, but the crab cakes sell out every day. It's amazing. People don't care what they cost. I'm shocked, but I'm happy.\"</p><p>Timetable: Some key events in the oyster bar's red-and-white checkered history</p><p>1913: The new Grand Central Terminal opens and \"supplies patrons with home comforts\" at a cost of more than $1 billion in today's dollars. Its main restaurant boasts one of the city's largest raw bars. Newspapers proclaim it equal to \"the most famous restaurants in New York or the capitals of Europe.\"</p><p>1941: The Oyster Bar is on the cover of the New Yorker, with throngs of ski-toting Manhattanites lined up for a sustaining stew before training it to the slopes.</p><p>1974: The Oyster Bar is closed. MTA gives restaurateur Jerome Brody $75,000 to renovate. He spends almost twice that and reopens two months later with a new menu and an expanded wine list.</p><p>1975: Jackie Onassis holds a press conference at the Oyster Bar as part of her campaign to protect Grand Central from development plans that would destroy the main waiting room, part of the main concourse, and perhaps the Oyster Bar itself.</p><p>1997: An overnight fire sweeps through the restaurant. Hundreds of the tiles pop out of the ceiling and virtually the entire restaurant is reduced to ash. Two weeks later, a reduced menu was being served in the Saloon; the restaurant reopened (minus many tiles) and the full menu was being offered again in under three months.</p><p>2018: Anguished cries issue from the Oyster Bar when the $14 caviar, egg, and sour cream sandwich is removed from the menu due to a shortage of Louisiana bowfin roe. The sandwich returned to the menu the following year and continues to have a devoted following.</p><p>2020: The restaurant closes twice: First in March, along with most everything else on the planet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and again in September, after a brief attempt to reopen fails due to a lack of business.</p><p>September 2021: The restaurant reopens.</p><p>GRUB INFLATION</p><p>Menu items at Grand Central Oyster Bar, past and present</p><p>Dinner in 1917</p><p>Oyster Stew: $0.40</p><p>Fried scallops with tartar sauce &amp; bacon:$0.80</p><p>Dozen Bluepoint Oysters:$0.35</p><p>Whole lobster:$1.75</p><p>Apple Cider:$0.10</p><p>Dinner in 2021</p><p>Oyster Stew: $15.95</p><p>Fried scallops over arugula:$32.95</p><p>Dozen Bluepoint Oysters: $35.50</p><p>Whole lobster: $33.95/pound $24</p><p>Manhattan: $13.50</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your favorite memories of the Oyster Bar?
