  "text": "<p>US stocks closed lower on Tuesday after a volatile session, as investors prepared for the prospect that the Federal Reserve will signal an increase in interest rates as soon as March. </p> <p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index fell 2.3 per cent, earlier dropping as much as 3.2 per cent. The decline followed a wild ride on Monday when the index, which includes Apple and Microsoft, sank almost 5 per cent before ending the day with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbc738b8-4f9c-49e6-814e-39d205bbf766\">small gain</a>. </p> <p>The broader S&amp;P 500 index, which is on course for its worst January on record, closed 1.2 per cent lower. Sectors of the index including tech, utilities and communication services took significant hits. The blue-chip index has lost nearly 9 per cent of its value so far this month.</p> <p>In Asia on Wednesday morning, Japan's Topix dipped 0.3 per cent after rising 0.9 per cent, while South Korea's tech-focused Kospi edged 0.3 per cent higher.</p> <p>Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech companies stabilised, with the Hang Seng Tech index up 1.8 per cent, after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbc738b8-4f9c-49e6-814e-39d205bbf766\">day of declines</a> for companies including internet giant Tencent and food delivery business Meituan.</p> <p>Investors are grappling with a hawkish turn by the Fed, which will finish a two-day monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday. Officials there are expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5f0e71f-e153-47ac-acc8-c31c2fa2a9b0\">signal their willingness</a> to raise interest rates in March to battle surging US inflation. Futures markets have priced in about four rate increases this year, each by a quarter of a percentage point. </p> <p>“Equities are suffering due to the fact that there is going to be some slower growth with higher interest rates,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings. </p> <p>In a sign of the rising tension, measures of expected short-term volatility in US stocks, such as the Cboe Vix index, were well above historic averages. “Volatility hurts everything, so things that should be robust and defensive get caught up in it,” said Nitesh Shah, research director at WisdomTree, an exchange traded fund provider. </p> <p>Christopher Murphy, a strategist with Susquehanna, a broker and trading group, added that relatively poor liquidity in recent days in the US stock market was exacerbating the sharp market swings registered since the start of the year.</p> <p>“It is hard to tell when the selling will abate,” he said.</p> <p>The Fed first pushed borrowing costs near zero at the start of the pandemic and bought vast quantities of Treasury bonds and backstopped other debt markets to ease financial conditions, boosting stock markets and investors' appetite for speculative assets. </p> <p>Trading in US Treasuries was muted on Tuesday, after prices rose in recent days as traders sheltered from stock market volatility. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, rose 0.01 percentage point to 1.78 per cent. </p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six others, moved 0.1 per cent higher on the day. </p> <p>The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.7 per cent, rebounding partially from a 3.8 per cent drop in the previous session. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index fell 1.7 per cent as Chinese tech companies declined.</p><p>Source: Kate Duguid and Eric Platt in New York, Naomi Rovnick in London and Jennifer Creery in Hong Kong  2022 'US stocks close lower in volatile session as investors weigh Fed moves' FT.com 26 January.
