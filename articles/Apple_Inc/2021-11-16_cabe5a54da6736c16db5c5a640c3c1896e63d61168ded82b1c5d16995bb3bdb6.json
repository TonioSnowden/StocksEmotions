  "title": "The Other Danchenko Dossier? In both the Trump and Hillary Clinton cases, fake 'intelligence' drove the FBI.",
  "text": "<p>The email, in turn, cited an alleged conversation between Hillary Clinton campaign aide Amanda Renteria and then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in which the Ms. Lynch promised to corral the email investigation and clear Mrs. Clinton's path to the nomination.</p><p>Largely forgotten, the Russian document contained at least one other tidbit—a prediction that Mr. Comey, as a Republican, would drag out the investigation to damage Mrs. Clinton.</p><p>A report by the Justice Department inspector general, while not describing the still-classified intercept, later said the FBI viewed the information as \"objectively false.\" But notice: The method behind the intercept appears to have been a doppelganger for the method used in the Steele dossier—a mixture of anodyne publicly available facts embellished with conspiratorial fictions masquerading as deep intelligence.</p><p>In fact, the method strongly resembles the work style, as described in the recent indictment by special counsel John Durham, of Igor Danchenko, the itinerant researcher and \"primary subsource\" for the Steele dossier. Mr. Danchenko first came to the U.S. as a teenage exchange student. Later, when he wasn't being arrested for public drunkenness, he played the minor man-about-Washington and expert on Russian political and business conditions.</p><p>Eventually the New York Times would report that the secret intercept was provided to the FBI in March 2016 by Dutch intelligence. To be clear, I have no way of knowing if Mr. Danchenko was its author—if he was packaging for others the same sort of fake intelligence he allegedly packaged for the British ex-spy Christopher Steele, and a copy landed on a Russian server, iPhone or laptop where Dutch intelligence could find it.</p><p>But it seems plausible and would explain two things:</p><p>Mr. Comey's FBI, according to the inspector general, did little investigating and didn't inform the Justice Department about the intelligence referring to Ms. Lynch, as if Mr. Comey knew it was not to be taken seriously for its information value. And this: Russian journalist Ivan Vorontsov, in a related lawsuit in the U.S., testified this year that the FBI had sought him out and questioned him in June 2016 about his ties to Mr. Danchenko, six months before the FBI linked Mr. Danchenko to the Steele dossier. Was the FBI's interest related to the phony \"intelligence\" the agency had received just a few weeks earlier from the Dutch?</p><p>In any case, it's time the public was told the truth. It's become a joke, and untenable, that the secret intelligence that precipitated the FBI's actions in the Hillary case remains hidden while the world gets the full skinny on the apparently equally fake Steele intelligence that inspired many of the FBI actions in the Trump case.</p><p>Let's follow through on one Steele-related example: Vladimir Putin was known in public reporting to have required a partial privatization of state oil giant Rosneft no later than the last day of 2016; the Steele dossier invented a bribe related to this transaction that was dangled in front of a Trump associate. Later the Guardian's Luke Harding and Rep. Adam Schiff would tout the dossier's anticipation of the late 2016 deal as evidence of its reliability, oblivious to the fact that the Rosneft sale had been publicly pending for a year.</p><p>Such idiocy, of course, is not entirely hapless. Around the same time, rather more astute was former Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe who, as I pointed out in 2017, quickly recognized that the Loretta Lynch-related email could have been fabricated by anybody with a little knowledge of Democratic personnel.</p><p>Mr. Comey's actions in the Hillary case, remember, culminated in his reopening of the case shortly before Election Day, tilting the race to Mr. Trump. Even Rep. Schiff, No. 1 sucker for the Steele fictions, later acknowledged that the \"most measurable\" and \"most significant\" way Russia influenced the 2016 race was via Mr. Comey's actions in the Hillary Clinton email case, completely unrelated to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Of one thing you can also be almost 100% certain: The information is not withheld from the American people to protect national security but to spare the FBI, the national intelligence establishment and former members of the Obama administration embarrassment or worse.</p><p>The Other Danchenko Dossier?</p>",
