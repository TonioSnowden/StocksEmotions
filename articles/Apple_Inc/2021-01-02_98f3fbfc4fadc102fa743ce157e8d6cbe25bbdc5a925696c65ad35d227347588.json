  "text": "<p>One of the things that fascinates me most about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/12e3551a-c48c-4c52-a4b8-31482818c9df\">working from home</a> is how the boundaries blur between the personal and the professional. </p> <p>The first example that came to mind was clothes: we have formal outfits — the ones we'd show during video calls — and comfortable ones, those we'd never show to our workmates and bosses. This was the first concept I began to explore in this series, “Homeffice”, but I soon discovered that it was far from the only case of boundaries blurring. </p> <p>Starting a few centimetres outside the frame of the webcam, each person creates their own world, right on their desk. In the images here, I photographed the secrets that we all have around us at home: personal items, books, food, drinks, tobacco and even pets crowding our “desks”. </p> <p>If there is something good about working from home, I'd say it is being able to create those little personal environments during the working day.</p>  <p><strong>Lorena Lanza, 29<br></strong><em>Specialist in music education and cello teacher</em></p> <p>“Doing online music classes does not allow me to enjoy the emotional part — which is very important when connecting with the interpretation — so much.”</p> <p><strong>Albert Rius, 35<br></strong><em>Remote personal banking manager</em></p> <p>“Teleworking has been very enriching personally and professionally. I became very aware of all the unproductive moments of day-to-day office work. Not being used to this new way of working and having work tools in the same daily living spaces has often made it difficult to finish work on time.”</p>  <p><strong>Mirjam Ziegler, 33<br></strong><em>Writer/customer service</em></p> <p>“I work as a writer in the morning and in customer service in the afternoon. I don't miss the ping-pong table that I never used because I had no time. I do not want to get back [to how it was]. I enjoy cooking. A different life has grown in my head.”</p>  <p><strong>Mónica Stalio, 46<br></strong><em>Senior operations supervisor</em></p> <p>“For me, working at home is the best (and only) good thing that this pandemic has brought: I have more free time, I work more calmly and I am more efficient. I enjoy my home and every second of break time.”</p>  <p><strong>Clarence Bekker, 51<br></strong><em>Musician</em></p> <p>“My experience with working from home is mixed. It's very easy to entertain people all over the world with songs from my lounge, but I still miss the warmth of the physical presence. Online concerts also have a lack of ambience and audience presence, but this is what it is.”</p> <p><em>Styling: Roxane Mercerat</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
