Economists were looking for a 0.4% decline.</p><p>As a result, the personal savings rate fell to 7.5% from 9.2% in the prior month.</p><p>The 12-month increase in the PCE index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose to 4.4% in September from 4.2% in the prior month. That's well above the Fed's 2% annual target rate.</p><p>The core PCE rate that strips out food and energy held steady at 3.6% on an annual basis.</p><p>Big picture: Economists are counting on continued consumer spending to power the economy. Consumers bolstered their savings during the pandemic but this financial cushion is being eroded in part by higher inflation.</p><p>Market reaction: Stocks DJIASPX were set to open lower on Friday after disappointing results from Amazon and Apple.</p>",
