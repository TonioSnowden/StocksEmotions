  "title": "WhatsApp Communities: Meta's Messaging App Now Supports Large Groups and Adds New Chat Features; Organizations and people will be able to set up 'communities' to discuss snow days, neighborhood construction or a shared passion for basket weaving.",
  "text": "<p>The company also introduced new messaging features for all of WhatsApp's more than two billion users, available in the coming weeks.</p><p>Communities can be set up around social groups, families, the places you live and work, or other related arenas. Within a school's community, separate group chats can exist: one solely for teachers, another for the fundraising committee and yet another for honors students.</p><p>In a Facebook post Thursday, Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the move is intended to enable \"people to not only communicate with close friends and contacts, but also with all of the different communities in your life.\"</p><p>Existing group chats aren't automatically added to a community and will stay within the chat section of WhatsApp. But if a friend group is all from your old college dorm, you (or the school) could set up a community with your group and others containing people you don't necessarily know.</p><p>Your chat group stays private, but you could also start receiving messages directed to the community at large. To cut down on notification overload, only community administrators will be able to send messages to all community members.</p><p>Even before the launch of Communities, users will start seeing WhatsApp's new messaging features. You'll be able to add emojis to individual chat bubbles from other people, the way you can now in Facebook Messenger and Apple's Messages app.</p><p>People will soon be able to share files up to two gigabytes via WhatsApp. And the app will support group voice calls up to 32 people. Previously, only eight people were allowed on a call. (The company didn't discuss any increase in video-call capacity.)</p><p>The app updates align with Mr. Zuckerberg's push toward connecting people with common interests. \"Groups are now at the heart of the experience just as much as your friends and family are,\" the CEO said at the company's F8 developer conference in 2019, amid a group-emphasized refresh of the Facebook platform.</p><p>Like with Facebook groups, a WhatsApp community administrator has special privileges and access. They can control who belongs to the community and can see all the members' phone numbers. Administrators for individual groups inside a community also have privileges, such as they can delete messages.</p><p>But Meta doesn't want people to think of WhatsApp Communities as the birth of a new social network.</p><p>\"It isn't like broadcasting on social media,\" said Jyoti Sood, the product lead for messaging at WhatsApp. \"You spin up smaller, more intimate messaging conversations and feel much more like you're talking back and forth.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will the WhatsApp Communities feature make you more likely to use the messaging service? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>You can't just join random groups and communities, and there isn't a way to search for them. However, once an administrator invites you into a Community, either through a link or text, you can see which other groups exist within it. If you see one you like, you can request to join.</p><p>Chats are still protected by end-to-end encryption. Your profile is only discoverable if someone has your phone number or if you're part of the same group. And you can control who sees your profile picture.</p><p>WhatsApp says it will limit how many people are allowed to be in a community. Currently, group chats on WhatsApp allow up to 256 people to join, but communities may contain thousands of people, Ms. Sood said.</p><p>â€”For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Dalvin Brown at dalvin.brown@wsj.com</p><p>WhatsApp Communities: Meta's Messaging App Now Supports Large Groups and Adds New Chat Features</p>",
