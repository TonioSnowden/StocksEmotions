  "title": "Google Nearly Doubles Profit Behind Red-Hot Ad Market; Search giant posts highest quarterly revenue increase in 14 years",
  "text": "<p>Alphabet said Tuesday that revenue rose 41% to $65.12 billion, its largest in 14 years. It posted a profit of $21.03 billion, nearly three times what it reported before the pandemic.</p><p>The red-hot digital-ad market has accelerated this year, with global spending on track to grow 26%, up from earlier projections of 15%, according to GroupM, a media-buying firm. Much of that windfall has flowed to Google, which has a dominant share of world-wide internet searches, digital navigation and online video viewership.</p><p>The company's ad business—led by Search, Maps and YouTube—posted $53.13 billion in sales from advertising, a 43% increase.</p><p>Much of Google's growth has come from e-commerce advertisers eager to reach customers whose product searches begin online. The company joined with Shopify Inc. this year to simplify search listings and ad purchases for 1.7 million merchants. The effort, which aimed to enliven its e-commerce segment, has helped turn retail ads into Google's largest growth contributor.</p><p>Personal Technology: Review</p><p>* Google Built the Pixel 6 Camera to Better Portray People With Darker Skin Tones. Does It?</p><p>In recent months, the search giant's retail-ad segment has benefited from the new privacy policy Apple Inc. rolled out. Since April, the iPhone maker has required apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked. The changes have weakened the performance of ads on Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc., according to ad buyers and smaller businesses. Many brands have shifted spending to Google as a result.</p><p>\"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,\" said Brian Wieser, GroupM's global president of business intelligence. \"Whatever data they have [at Google] is better than what most others have.\"</p><p>YouTube has been another major driver of Google's advertising gains. The video behemoth reported sales grew 43% to $7.21 billion in the quarter. The business is on track to generate nearly as much revenue this year as Netflix Inc., a subscription business valued at nearly $300 billion.</p><p>Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com</p><p>Google Nearly Doubles Profit Behind Red-Hot Ad Market</p>",
