  "text": "<p>Apple's defense of its mobile operating system, or iOS, was released as the House Judiciary Committee debates a package of bills aimed at reining in the nation's largest tech companies.</p><p>Provisions in one of the bills, known as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, could effectively give Apple's customers broader control over which apps to download on their devices.</p><p>It could prohibit Apple from continuing to block a practice known as sideloading, in which users install apps directly onto their iPhones without having to go through the company's App Store.</p><p>In Europe, the Digital Markets Act was introduced in December and is making its way through the legislative process. It too includes provisions to open the door to sideloading.</p><p>Apple isn't the only tech company taking issue with the House committee's package of bills. Brian Huseman, Amazon.com Inc.'s vice president of public policy, said Tuesday that the proposed legislative language \"would have significant negative effects on the hundreds of thousands of American small and medium-size businesses that sell in our store and tens of millions of consumers who buy products from Amazon.\" He urged the committee to delay the bills.</p><p>Apple's report follows comments by CEO Tim Cook last week that sideloading would damage privacy and security.</p><p>The Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that includes Epic Games Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, praised the legislation to allow sideloading. The group's executive director, Meghan DiMuzio, called it \"an important step as momentum builds to hold platforms accountable for their anticompetitive behavior.\" Epic and Spotify both have battled with Apple over its App Store rules.</p><p>Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% of revenue generated by apps distributed through its digital store.</p>",
