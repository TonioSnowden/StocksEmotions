Nominees and those in the audience need to show proof of coronavirus vaccination and two negative PCR tests, according to producers. The vaccine mandate won't extend to performers and presenters, but they still have to follow the same testing protocol.</p><p>Anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 within a five-day period of the ceremony will be unable to attend, the academy said. Those who tested positive six-to-10 days out will need proof of two negative PCR tests before March 17, taken at least one day apart and administered by a medical professional, the academy said Friday.</p><p>Social distancing and masking in the days up to the event are strongly recommended, particularly for members of the media planning to cover the ceremony, the academy added.</p><p>How can I watch the Oscars?</p><p>The Oscars will be televised live on ABC and broadcast in more than 200 territories world-wide.

Expect the unexpected!\" ceremony producer Will Packer said in a statement.</p><p>Who are the nominees?</p><p>\"The Power of the Dog\" scored 12 Oscar nominations, including nods for best picture and best director for Jane Campion.

Judi Dench, who is 87 years old, would become the oldest acting winner if she wins the best supporting actress Oscar for her performance in \"Belfast.\" Ms. Dench has previously been nominated eight times, winning best supporting actress for 1998's \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Anthony Hopkins was the previous record holder, having won last year's best actor award for \"The Father\" at the age of 83.</p><p>\"Dos Oruguitas\" from \"Encanto\" was nominated for best original song. The Disney film was also nominated in the categories of animated feature and best original score. If \"Dos Oruguitas\" wins the best original song Oscar, Lin-Manuel Miranda would become the 17th person to complete the EGOT, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.</p><p>Troy Kostur, who was nominated for best supporting actor for his performance in \"CODA,\" could become the second deaf actor to win an Academy Award. Marlee Matlin, who plays Mr. Kostur's wife in \"CODA,\" was the first; she took home the best actress Oscar for 1986's \"Children of a Lesser God.\"</p><p>What has the Academy changed this year?</p><p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and SciencesAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences committed to a field of 10 nominees for best picture, instead of a number that fluctuated from year to year. The goal was to capture a broader range of films in the most prestigious category.</p><p>Additionally, in recent years the academy has aggressively expanded its voting body, with big increases among members outside the U.S.</p><p>In late February, the academy said it was cutting eight categories from its live broadcastâ€”angering many in Hollywood, who said the omissions were an insult to the filmmaking craft.</p><p>Awards for best original score, film editing, production design, makeup and hairstyling, sound, documentary short subject, live action short film and animated short film will be given out before the main ceremony. Clips from that event will be included in the main broadcast, the academy said.</p><p>Were there any notable snubs from the Oscars?</p><p>\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" dominated pop culture and defied pandemic trends to become one of the highest-grossing films ever. The film failed to land in any of the top Oscar categories, despite a push for awards respect by Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios. The blockbuster received a nod for visual effects but none in the high-profile categories that might help entice more viewers to ABC's telecast in March.</p><p>The song \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" from Disney's \"Encanto\" wasn't nominated because Disney had submitted the ballad \"Dos Oruguitas\" for awards consideration. This submission was before \"Bruno\" exploded in popularity across TikTok.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Ginger Adams Otis at Ginger.AdamsOtis@wsj.com</p><p>When Are the Oscars?
