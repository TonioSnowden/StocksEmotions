  "text": "<p>\"Industry lobbyists in Washington are going absolutely crazy,\" said Rep. Lance Gooden (R., Texas), who supports the proposals. \"I have received text messages and calls, some friendly and some not, but all very much against these bills.\"</p><p>At a news conference Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) stood with lawmakers from both parties and called the bills \"a bipartisan plan to level the playing field for innovators, entrepreneurs and startups.\" He said he expected the committee to consider approving the bills next week.</p><p>While the legislation is backed by a handful of Republicans, support is much stronger among Democrats. Tech giants are seeking to turn the Republican divisions into a bulwark against passing the bills, industry lobbyists said.</p><p>Fewer GOP votes in the House would make it tougher for the proposals to gain support in the Senate, where bipartisan support is likely necessary for them to pass.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said he opposes giving too much enforcement power to antitrust agencies. He spoke out after President Biden, a Democrat, named a critic of big technology firms, Lina Khan, to head the Federal Trade Commission, giving her authority to pursue antitrust initiatives.</p><p>Two of the biggest tech companies targeted by the House legislation, Apple and Amazon, are represented in Washington by Jeff Miller, a close ally of Mr. McCarthy. The two got to know each other three decades ago when Mr. Miller was a young political aide in California.</p><p>Mr. Miller registered to lobby for Amazon Web Services in July 2019, and the company has paid his firm $440,000 through this March, lobbying records show. He signed on with Apple in November 2019, and the company has paid his firm $600,000 through this March, the records show.</p>",
