  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>As the poet once said: April is the cruellest month.</p> <p>Britons are braced for what Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey referred to this week as a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b303855-cc54-4e4b-83f6-d0f3e764b6cf\">historic shock</a>” to incomes, as the war in Ukraine exacerbates a growing cost of living crisis. This is set to worsen from Friday when the new month ushers in an intense period of price rises and tax increases.</p> <p>New <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/articles/impactofincreasedcostoflivingonadultsacrossgreatbritain/november2021tomarch2022\">survey data</a> from the Office for National Statistics this morning showed 83 per cent of adults reporting an increase in the cost of living in March. Some 90 per cent blamed the price of food, followed by gas or electricity bills (79 per cent) and the price of fuel (71 per cent).</p> <p>Surging energy prices, one of the key drivers behind inflation's leap to a 30-year high of 6.2 per cent in February, are set to increase further in April as the regulatory price cap rises by more than 50 per cent to nearly £2,000 a year. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that this could even hit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02b54b19-0538-45f9-9ea5-eb855352ece3\">£2,800</a> in October when the cap is next adjusted.</p> <p>Bailey said the shock from energy prices would be “larger than any single year in the 1970s”, with the BoE now expecting inflation to hit 8 per cent in the second quarter and potentially even higher in the autumn.</p> <p>These concerns are set to be compounded by April's rise in National Insurance. </p> <p>In last week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adf9a0fe-1e4c-42cd-96a4-1e924a6ba8d6\">Spring Statement</a>, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak made changes that he said amounted to the “biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century”, an assertion repeated by Prime Minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1509124734180634632\">Boris Johnson</a> in parliament today. However, the OBR has said the measures would only give back £1 for every £6 in higher taxes already announced by Sunak. Think-tanks have also challenged the claim, arguing that the majority of workers would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7c26044-a770-4d9b-a668-b15f67a2f8bf\">see their taxes rise</a>.</p> <p>The OBR says the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31786311-7c07-433c-9485-5e735ea3fb43\">squeeze on living standards</a> in 2022-23 would be the largest fall in a single financial year since records began in 1956-57.</p> <p>The squeeze is also showing up in other official statistics. UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/929a4297-7517-432c-85a3-6616b45e8fe1\">credit card debt</a> hit a record high in February, according to BoE data published yesterday, as individuals borrowed a net £1.5bn — the highest monthly amount since records began in 1993. </p> <p>Businesses, too, have a difficult month ahead. Aside from growing increases in costs, they also have to pay an increased national living wage and higher National Insurance contributions, while pandemic support such as cuts to VAT for hospitality businesses and a moratorium on eviction for unpaid rent comes to an end.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>German inflation hits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f2fb7cc-3039-416b-ad22-f42315d0b1d0\">40-year high</a> of 7.6% in March</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/686b7816-5046-446a-92fb-a600c5ac11c7\">Holland &amp; Barrett</a> payment held up by HSBC over sanction concerns</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db1c6786-6707-4d22-bf43-9c7686cbe97b\">BioNTech</a> to return almost €2bn to shareholders after Covid vaccine success</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a442e6-5603-4b16-8218-e5fd36b0e1bf\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Germany</strong> has taken the first step towards <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0706d6f4-6668-4f67-ab1c-d535d847caf7\">gas rationing</a> as it prepares for a halt in supplies from Russia over Moscow's insistence on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7137b5da-f877-4032-b98e-fab6ffb78344\">payment in roubles</a>, a move firmly rejected by EU and G7 leaders. Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d702e4cc-a688-4dba-a05a-dfbd1f9442f9\">new explainer</a> explores whether <strong>US natural gas </strong>could relieve Europe from its dependence on Russia.

She said higher energy prices had already cut eurozone income by 1.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021, implying a “loss of about €150bn in one year”. New EU data this morning showed “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a442e6-5603-4b16-8218-e5fd36b0e1bf#post-87c7a40a-8937-4d04-b3b2-6ac6a2dd0bc6\">plummeting consumer confidence</a>” since the invasion of Ukraine.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>The UK is considering yet another delay to <strong>post-Brexit</strong> <strong>border checks</strong> to prevent what industry has warned could be a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53636e5d-eaaf-4d45-a3bc-a827d4b551a0\">supply chain disaster</a>. Chancellor Rishi Sunak admitted earlier this week that recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/484db1cf-e65e-49b3-a71e-fdd915a874a6\">dismal trade figures</a> “might” be linked to leaving the EU. Trade Secrets writer Alan Beattie says the EU has also suffered from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ee03f7a-c234-4735-8cea-f96e7b22e56f\">UK's departure</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong> approved a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/713ef01c-c858-4394-bacc-8284b8f841bb\">€16bn “shock plan”</a> to address the effects of the Ukraine crisis, including fuel price cuts and proposals to reduce electricity costs, as well as increasing spending from the EU's €800bn pandemic recovery fund.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>The <strong>World Bank</strong> has warned that the war in Ukraine could cause a debt crisis and tip millions of people in low and middle-income countries into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f09f4864-fc81-4dbd-8086-25e70ed01019\">poverty</a>. High commodity prices, particularly for oil and wheat, along with collapsing trade growth, rising interest rates and a stronger US dollar would all make it harder for net importers to service mounting debts, it said, shaving a percentage point off growth rates the bank forecast just a month ago.</p> <p>A strict new lockdown in <strong>Shanghai</strong> — which yesterday reported a record 4,477 Covid cases, more than any other Chinese city in the pandemic apart from Hong Kong — is causing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00362e61-d3d5-4364-9069-196aaa0592d5\">severe disruption</a>. The FT editorial board said China's <strong>zero-Covid</strong> goal was no longer sustainable and that it needed a new strategy for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a34a67aa-f4ea-4f6b-b162-568919007e57\">living with coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eda5e2e8-2ddc-48d1-a2bb-fd73aac599ff\">Lex column</a> described President Joe Biden's plans for a <strong>US wealth tax</strong> as a “worthwhile work in progress towards a fairer split”. Here's an explanation of how the proposed tax, which would hit households worth more than $100mn, would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5147f06-83a8-488a-a1f6-711717704050\">work in practice</a>.</p> <p>Seiji Kihara, one of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's most powerful aides, told the Financial Times that <strong>Japan</strong> needed to hit its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/924facf0-b656-4afc-8ffe-96a878666849\">2 per cent inflation target</a> and do so through higher domestic demand rather than surging commodity prices. “The most important thing is to end deflation,” he said.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> has announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ade33e5-a1a5-4d3c-9987-bea4ef869df2\">giveaway budget</a> with a focus on easing cost of living pressures ahead of a general election in May.

Campaigners say fuel financing is dominated by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi and Bank of America — all of whom are members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. US environment agency chief Michael Regan said increased production of fossil fuels and the transition to clean energy were not “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52bb7283-ef3e-4a99-ba7b-bb6dbc0debb8\">mutually exclusive</a>”. </p> <p><em>Join us for the Energy Source Live Summit on April 7, where we will take a deep dive into the issues set to reshape the US energy industry in the years to come.
