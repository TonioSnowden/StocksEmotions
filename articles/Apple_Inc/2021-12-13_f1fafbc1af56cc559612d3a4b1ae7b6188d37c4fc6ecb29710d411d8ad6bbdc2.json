  "text": "<p>\"It's to get you to move away from being shy about being a creator,\" Mr. Wilson said. SoundCloud expects that many users who join the platform free will eventually decide to pay for its services.</p><p>SoundCloud differs from major streaming platforms such as Spotify Technology SA and Apple Inc.'s music service because SoundCloud allows independent artists to upload their own tracks, view data on listener engagement and connect directly with their audience. The company said it has around 30 million active creators and 300 million tracks on its platform.</p><p>Privately held SoundCloud expects to generate a net profit by 2023, according to Mr. Wilson. Investment firms Temasek Holdings and Raine Group LLC bought a large stake in the company in 2017.</p><p>SoundCloud in 2019 generated revenue of 147.6 million euros, equivalent to $167.5 million, up 37% from a year earlier, according to a U.K. regulatory filing.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
