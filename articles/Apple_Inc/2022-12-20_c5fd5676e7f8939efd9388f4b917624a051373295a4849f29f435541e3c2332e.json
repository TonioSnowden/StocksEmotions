  "title": "U.S. News: Tech Companies Make Push to Fend Off Regulation",
  "text": "<p>The Federal Trade Commission, Labor Department and other agencies also are taking aim at big tech companies, and major bills in Congress to establish online privacy protections, impose legal liability on social media for their content and toughen antitrust rules remain on the table. But the odds of this legislation passing are diminishing quickly, advocates on both sides say.</p><p>Significant measures with the best chances of passing heading into the home stretch include two narrowly targeted bills: one to enhance children's online protections and the other to limit the gatekeeper powers of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google over smartphone apps.</p><p>Biden White House officials have joined lawmakers in lobbying for passage, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>In response, tech companies last week began launching ads to fight the app-market fairness bill, which lawmakers are considering including in an omnibus spending package.</p><p>Industry spending on advertising to fend off regulation has exceeded $100 million since the beginning of 2021. That money and the industry's lobbying muscle have helped tip the scales in its favor so far, according to supporters of the legislation.</p><p>\"These are some of the most powerful companies the world has ever known, and they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent any common-sense reform,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.). She said allowing the companies to dominate policy debates in Washington \"is no longer a viable option.\"</p><p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) also complained of the tech companies' heavy spending to fight regulations she has pushed.</p><p>Much of the antiregulation advertising has run in lawmakers' home districts, which supporters say has added to the pressure on lawmakers to avoid taking tough votes.</p><p>Lobbyists for big technology companies say the tech-targeted legislation addresses issues that most Americans don't see needing to be fixed.</p><p>\"If this was a shutout it was because the legislation struck out on substance,\" said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>The CCIA alone has spent about $58.8 million on advertising opposing the bills, while five other tech-allied groups spent about $56 million on causes including fighting antitrust regulation, according to new data from AdImpact.</p><p>Meta Platforms Inc. spent an additional $55.6 million largely to promote its position in favor of some sort of regulation, according to AdImpact data. Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Apple and Meta all are on track to spend more on lobbying in 2022 compared with 2021, according to data from OpenSecrets, a group that tracks money in politics.</p><p>For lawmakers and others who say big technology companies have become too powerful, the current congressional session was seen as their best hope for passing new laws. The politically divided Congress that begins in January is widely expected to do little more when it comes to big-tech regulation, thanks to partisan differences.</p><p>Big tech companies still face regulatory risks in the coming year. But much of the focus is expected to shift to federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Labor Department, as well as the Supreme Court.</p>",
