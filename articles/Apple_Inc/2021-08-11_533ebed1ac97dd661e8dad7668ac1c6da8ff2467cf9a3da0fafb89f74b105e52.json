  "text": "<p>\n  CODA </p><p>\n  Friday, Apple TV+ </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   In music, a coda is an ending that's also a variation on the established theme, an unexpected send-off. CODA, on the other hand, stands for Child of Deaf Adults, the one in Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" being Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high schooler for whom music is everything. Is her trajectory going to be a shock? No. But what is surprising is the moving, even heartbreaking, way writer-director Heder tells Ruby's story without resorting to cliched characterizations or syrupy sentimentality. </p><p>\n  Co-starring the deaf actors Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as Ruby's parents, Jackie and Frank, and Daniel Durant as her brother, Leo, \"CODA\" is based on a premise as old as movie sound itself -- \"The Jazz Singer,\" after all, was about a performer whose father wanted him to be a cantor, but who defied family tradition and became a pop sensation. In \"CODA,\" the conflict is less about deaf culture than it is about simple survival: Ruby is the hearing member of the family fishing business in Gloucester, Mass. Without her, the safety net, so to speak, falls apart. But she loves to sing. She's good. And she has a high-school choir teacher, Bernardo Villalobos (the wonderful Eugenio Derbez), who offers to help her prepare to audition for the Berklee College of Music in not-so-nearby Boston. Crises and conflict ensue. </p><p>\n  One of the more unorthodox aspects of \"CODA\" is the salty portrait of Ruby's family. Her parents are lusty, carnal, gleefully vulgar (perhaps because it grosses Ruby out) and a constant source of embarrassment for a teenager whose classmates seem to have missed the anti-bullying memo: When she first started school, she says, she sounded \"like a deaf person.\" It was all she'd known. And apparently no one has ever forgotten it. </p><p>\n  Kids are rotten, it is often said, but they're particularly rotten in Ms. Heder's Gloucester, oblivious to Ruby's burden, why she might smell like fish after working since 3 a.m. or why she falls asleep on her desk in class. When Jackie bemoans the idea that \"her baby\" might leave home, Frank responds, \"She never was a baby\": She's been the family interpreter all her life, their connection to the hearing world. In a film that doesn't indulge itself in feeling sorry for anyone, it's a poignant line and a somewhat shattering moment. </p><p>\n  Similarly affecting is the scene where Villalobos, or Mr. V, recognizes what he's got in Ruby (Ms. Jones is far too polished a singer for a high schooler, but you'll not care). Perhaps because much of \"CODA\" is rather straightforward and character-plot driven, there are few startling visual moments, but one is a medium shot of Mr. V, in his classroom, regarding Ruby and her talent and being captured by cinematographer Paula Huidobro in a manner that is compositional poetry. </p><p>\n  Where the Ruby-teacher relationship falters is not the fault of the actors, but the writer. Mr. V is meant to be slightly unreasonable, a hard-liner about Ruby being both serious and on time. But the script takes the very common and dubious tack of not letting the characters simply explain their situations to each other. When Ruby's family -- cheated by wholesalers and oppressed by federal regulations -- starts a fishermen's co-op, it creates for Ruby an additional distraction, and friction. But when she's late for Mr. V -- a TV crew is coming to interview the Rossis at precisely the time Ruby, their interpreter, has a lesson -- she explains none of this to her teacher, who rants about her lack of devotion and disregard for his valuable time. Why Mr. V is so oblivious to everything going on in town is, of course, another question a viewer might ask. So is what Ruby sees in the classmate with whom she begins a relationship, one that radiates all the romance of last Thursday's catch of the day. </p><p>\n  But Mr. Derbez is terrific. The grizzly looking Mr. Kotsur, as plausible an on-screen fisherman who's ever off-loaded a net full of flounder, wordlessly makes Frank into a likably excitable and complicated guy. Ms. Matlin, a more familiar personality (Best Actress Oscar in 1987 for \"Children of a Lesser God\"), creates with Mr. Kotsur and Mr. Durant a family convincingly loving and yet always separate from Ruby. Jackie admits as much when she recalls her daughter's birth and being crushed when she learned the girl could hear. \"CODA\" is respectful of these kinds of differences without either criticizing or sentimentalizing them. Sometimes they're just funny: When Jackie and Frank attend a performance by Ruby, the signed conversation between them is about how their daughter's dress matches the curtains, or what they want for dinner. Ms. Heder at one point takes us out of the hearing world and into silence, precisely when Ruby is singing. It is, in a word, sensational. </p><p></p>",
