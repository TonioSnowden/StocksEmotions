  "text": "<p>In 2019, a highly-valued US tech company — until recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c8644e-240e-45a8-954d-31d58e036dec\">led by a flamboyant billionaire founder</a> — called a halt on its hyperactive property-based expansion and sent chills through parts of the UK commercial real estate sector. </p> <p>Then it was WeWork, whose so-called blitzscaling had accounted for about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b41bda9c-e13c-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc\">a tenth of</a> London office market lettings in the first eight months of that year. When WeWork WeCrashed, as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a04df35e-e539-4688-95a0-2fb98cccd489\">Apple TV drama starring Jared Leto</a> as Adam Neumann dubs it, it prompted concerns about the office markets where the shared office provider had quickly become the largest private tenant.</p> <p>This month, it was Amazon that took the tech shine off the traditionally unglamorous business of warehousing and logistics. After the ecommerce group warned that it had over-leased and over-hired in the pandemic, shares in UK-listed logistics companies like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb3e1b85-6a22-4c73-830a-664e6b7c60b4?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">Segro and Tritax Big Box tumbled </a>and have yet to recover: both are down by about a fifth this month.</p> <p>You can see why on the face of it. There has been record demand for UK warehouses in the past two years, with take-up north of 50mn square feet compared with a pre-pandemic average of 32mn sq ft. And Amazon, in both of the last two years, accounted for about a quarter of the market. Rather like WeWork, its slowdown looked like a blow to those who were buying or building on the assumption of an ever-expanding US juggernaut. Then add to that <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/timeseries/j4mc/drsi\">the drop in online</a> as a percentage of total retail sales, which hit nearly 38 per cent in the early locked-down months of 2021 but has fallen back to 26 per cent.</p> <p>But it is hard to imagine Amazon's pause — with the company planning to grow into its excess capacity — is about to leave the UK swimming in top quality logistics space. Unlike 2019 offices, where Brexit had already dented enthusiasm that was about to be obliterated by Covid, the UK sheds market looks strong. </p> <p>Of a record first quarter this year, with 13.6mn sq ft taken up, only 3 per cent was occupied by Amazon. Vacant space is at a record low, or a rate of 2.8 per cent. Kevin Mofid at Savills reckons that even if Amazon were to vacate a tenth of its stock, which it won't, that would only move the vacancy rate to about 3.6 per cent. That's against an average of 5.8 per cent since 2015, and a rule of thumb that says 12 per cent is needed to tilt the market in occupiers' favour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, many of the longer-term trends pushing companies towards taking more, modern logistics space remain in place. After the pandemic ructions, ecommerce will continue to grow, with many retailers still trying to catch up with the Covid acceleration. The one-two punch of Brexit disruption to just-in-time manufacturing followed by the global gumming up of supply chains in the pandemic means more desire for space close to base. </p> <p>The UK market <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45627152\">is under-warehoused</a> on a per capita basis compared with other countries. (The US, which starts from a much higher base per capita, is currently building more warehouse space than the UK's entire standing stock, says Savills). </p> <p>UK planning makes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9582767d-49fe-43e5-afe1-372fd6f1dd22\">new space hard to come</a> by: “There is substantial undersupply embedded in the system because local authorities didn't plan enough in advance or recognise the change in demand”, says Matthew Griffith, director of policy at Business West.</p> <p>That is all translating into healthy rental growth for developers and landlords. Some big developers won't quote rents or take offers early in a speculative build to avoid having underpriced relative to market once it completes.</p> <p>The problem may be less occupation, and more valuation — an issue WeWork, with its $47bn private market price tag, also suffered with. Listed logistics stocks had been on a tear, and the investment money trying to get into warehouses this cycle had tightened yields by 250 basis points to about 3.5 per cent, according to Berenberg. In a rising interest rate environment, that trend couldn't last for ever — Amazon or otherwise.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:helen.thomas@ft.com\">helen.thomas@ft.com</a><br><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/helentbiz\">@helentbiz</a></p><p>Source: Helen Thomas 2022 'Did Amazon WeCrash the warehouse market?'
