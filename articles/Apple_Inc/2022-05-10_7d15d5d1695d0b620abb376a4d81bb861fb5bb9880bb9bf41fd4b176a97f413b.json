  "text": "<p>\"Today, the spirit of the iPod lives on,\" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's worldwide marketing senior vice president.</p><p>For some, the iPod—which came in various color iterations and models—was consumers' first introduction to Apple. The music device over time fell out of favor, though, as the iPhone and other smartphones gave people the ability to listen to music on their cellular devices.</p><p>The original iPod came out in October 2001 and weighed 6.5 ounces. Apple later introduced the iPod Mini in 2004 and the iPod Nano in 2006. The iPod touch was released in 2007 and the iPod Nano (7th generation) came out in 2012.</p><p>Apple released the iPod Shuffle (4th generation) in 2015 and the iPod Touch (7th generation) two years ago.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Is Discontinuing the iPod After a More Than Two Decade Run</p>",
