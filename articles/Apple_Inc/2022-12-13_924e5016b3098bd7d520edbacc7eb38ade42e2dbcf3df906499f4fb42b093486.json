  "text": "<p>The attorneys general said Google and Apple should be responsible for ensuring accurate age ratings and warned they may face legal action from the states if TikTok's rating isn't addressed.</p><p>\"Parents are the first line of defense, but their job is being made more difficult by ratings that misrepresent the true content found on the platform,\" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said in a statement. \"It's past time for Apple and Google to do their part in helping parents keep their kids safe online and increase their TikTok ratings.\"</p><p>Representatives from TikTok, Google, and Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The state coalition, led by Mr. Knudsen, also includes attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia.</p><p>The letter adds to state efforts pushing back against the reach and influence of TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd.</p><p>Indiana filed a pair of lawsuits against TikTok last week that alleged the platform deceives consumers about its adult content and data security. The state said the lawsuits were the first of their kind. Governors in states including Texas, South Carolina and Alabama in recent days moved to block state agencies from using TikTok because of concerns about data breaches and national security.</p><p>Different coalitions of state attorneys general launched probes into TikTok this year, including to examine the app's impact on teens' mental health. Those investigations are continuing.</p><p>Write to Erin Mulvaney at erin.mulvaney@wsj.com</p><p>States Demand That Google, Apple Raise Content Ratings for TikTok</p>",
