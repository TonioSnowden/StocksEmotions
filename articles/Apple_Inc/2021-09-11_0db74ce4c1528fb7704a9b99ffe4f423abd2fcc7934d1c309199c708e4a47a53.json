  "text": "<p>\n  [SATISFYING AND SEASONAL FOOD IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Chef: Frederic Eliot </p><p>\n  His Restaurants: Fore Street, Scales, and Street and Co., all in Portland, Maine </p><p>\n  What He's Known For: Doing right by Portland's extraordinary local seafood and produce. Weaving French techniques into classic New England dishes. Celebrating Maine's seasonal rhythms. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Only when he moved to the U.S. did chef Frederic Eliot realize how much he loves cooking the dishes of his childhood, spent on a family farm in Normandy. At Scales in Portland, Maine, he riffs on those classics, using local produce. \"Connecting French and New England food isn't a leap,\" he said. \"The cooking here is old-school and there's a lot of European influence.\" </p><p>\n  In his final Slow Food Fast recipe, Mr. Eliot shares a hearty salad made with crumbled Stilton, warm croutons, crisp prosciutto and a mustard-shallot vinaigrette. It's a loose take on a dish from his youth, made with warm cheese. </p><p>\n  Here the cheese isn't warm; rather, the prosciutto and croutons introduce some temperature contrast, which the frisee, endive and spigarello are sturdy enough to handle. To avoid overdressing, pour the vinaigrette around the rim of the bowl. \"You want to toss this with your hands, to feel how coated the leaves are,\" Mr. Eliot said. \"Once they're lightly slicked, if you want more flavor, add salt.\" This way, the leaves soften slightly without losing their snap. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Total Time: 20 minutes </p><p>\n  Serves: 4 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1/2 medium shallot, minced </p><p>\n  1 tablespoon Sherry or apple cider vinegar </p><p>\n  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard </p><p>\n  1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard </p><p>\n  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </p><p>\n  1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil </p><p>\n  6 thin slices prosciutto </p><p>\n  2 cups roughly torn sourdough bread </p><p>\n  2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey </p><p>\n  1 head frisee, leaves separated and roughly torn </p><p>\n  1/2 bunch broccoli spigarello or escarole, leaves roughly torn </p><p>\n  2 heads red or white endive, leaves separated </p><p>\n  4 ounces crumbled Stilton or other blue cheese </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. In a small bowl, whisk together minced shallots, vinegar, both mustards and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Let shallots macerate at least 5 minutes. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. Set a large frying pan over medium heat and swirl in 1/2 tablespoon oil. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, fry prosciutto until it shrinks and lightly colors, about 1 minute per side. Transfer prosciutto to a paper-towel-lined plate to cool and crisp. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. In the same frying pan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil. Stir in bread and fry over medium heat until crisp and golden on all sides, about 4 minutes. Set croutons aside to cool and season with salt and pepper. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4. Before serving, whisk remaining oil and honey into macerated shallots. Adjust seasonings to taste. In a large salad bowl, toss together frisee, spigarello and endive. Season with salt. Toss in Stilton and croutons. Pour dressing around interior rim of bowl. Use your hands to toss salad, scraping dressing from sides of bowl. Crumble fried prosciutto over salad and serve. </p><p></p>",
