  "text": "<p><strong>Red Paddle Original Roll Top Dry&#xa0;Bag&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Made from a heavy-duty abrasion- and puncture-resistant TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), this&#xa0;<a href=\"https://redoriginal.com/products/roll-top-dry-bag\">waterproof bag</a> will protect valuables and a dry change of clothes. Reinforcements at the base and wide-welded seams give added durability, plus the D-rings on both the top and bottom mean it's easily secured&#xa0;to the deck. You can also clip on the padded shoulder strap to carry it around comfortably dockside. <em>From £26.95</em></p>  <p><strong>Helly Hansen Aegir Race&#xa0;sailing jacket</strong></p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.hellyhansen.com/en_gb/aegir-race-jacket-33869?color=301324\">highly protective jacket</a> cocoons you from&#xa0;the harshest conditions on deck – wind, rain or spray – while offering great freedom of movement. Falling into the bracket of “offshore-worthy gear”, it features details such as a fleece-lined collar that offers protection and warmth high around the neck&#xa0;and chin. It also has reflective patches, fully taped seams, a second rubberised inner&#xa0;cuff to keep water out, and its four-layer construction makes for incredible waterproofing and durability. <em>£550</em></p>  <p><strong>Yeti Tundra 105 Hard&#xa0;Cooler</strong></p> <p>When it's time for you and your shipmates to drop anchor, a well-stocked <a href=\"https://uk.yeti.com/collections/coolers/products/tundra-105?variant=30346181148752\">cool box</a> is a godsend. At 78cm long and 50cm high, this can hold 67 tins of beer (with a 2:1 ice ratio factored in), and as it is wide rather than tall, it's not only space-saving but doubles as an extra seat. Check out the great details such as heavy-duty and easy-to-use rubber latches, nice carry handles and a built-in drainage system for easy cleaning. <em>£479.99</em></p>  <p><strong>Gill UV Tec Active Shorts</strong></p> <p>Thanks to a four-way stretch fabric, these <a href=\"https://gb.gillmarine.com/mens-uv-tec-pro-shorts/\">shorts</a> are supremely comfortable and&#xa0;breathable, allowing you to move freely around the confined spaces of a boat. They have a water-repellent finish, so light splashes will roll off, and should bigger waves lend you a soaking, the lightweight fabric is quick-drying. You'll find nice deep hand pockets, two popper-secured cargo pockets and two rear pockets offering lots of storage. The shorts are reinforced with an abrasion-resistant material on the seat, have 50+ UV protection and the velcro tabs around the waist band make them adjustable for comfort. <em>£80</em></p>  <p><strong>Dubarry Ultima Sailing Boot&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Built specifically for boating – from recreation to racing – these <a href=\"https://www.dubarry.com/women/footwear/sailing-boots/ultima-sailing-boot-black\">durable boots</a> are made from quality waterproof leather, which becomes strong and supple with&#xa0;years of hard use, and as they are soaked in salt water. The breathable Gore-Tex insulation keeps your feet warm, and the non-marking grippy outsoles are perfect on the deck. <em>£279</em></p>  <p><strong>Catalyst Total Protection Case For&#xa0;iPhone</strong></p> <p>This fully sealed <a href=\"https://www.catalystlifestyle.com/collections/waterproof-cases-for-iphone\">iPhone case</a> is drop-proof to 2m and waterproof to&#xa0;10m, and will help protect your phone not only when boating, but&#xa0;in&#xa0;everyday life too. Samsung and&#xa0;Google have similar versions. <em>$89.99</em></p>  <p><strong>Garmin EchoMAP UHD 75sv Sonar and&#xa0;Fishfinder</strong></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/690481/pn/010-02340-10\">navigation and fish-finding unit</a> in one device, this is a must-have in the cockpit of your RIB (rigid inflatable boat) or small vessel. Pair it with a compatible transducer and the sonar will let you know the depth of water below the boat and create high-resolution images so you can differentiate between the size of fish. The&#xa0;sunlight-readable 7in touchscreen is easy to use and navigate, plus it comes pre-loaded with detailed coastal charts for navigational use. <em>£899.99</em>&#xa0;</p>  <p><strong>Musto LPX GTX Infinium Aero Jacket</strong></p> <p>This very <a href=\"https://www.musto.com/en_GB/lpx-gtx-infinium-aero-jacket/82100.html\">lightweight jacket</a> is&#xa0;perfect for inshore sailing in&#xa0;the spring and summer, or&#xa0;as a handy all-rounder for&#xa0;more casual boating use. It's made with two-layer Gore-Tex fabric with fully&#xa0;taped seams and integrated hood, so it's also&#xa0;a windstopper that's suitable for light showers or&#xa0;spray, and is highly breathable when in action on the water. <em>£250</em></p>  <p><strong>Victorinox Ranger Grip Boatsman</strong></p> <p>This boating-specific <a href=\"https://www.victorinox.com/uk/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Large-Pocket-Knives/Ranger-Grip-Boatsman/p/0.9798.MWC8\">pocket knife</a> boasts 22 functions, including the main blade that conveniently can be opened with one hand where it locks safely in place. Also notable are the needle-nose pliers with ingenious lever operation; a marlin spike to untie fiddly knots or splice rope; and the essential bottle opener and corkscrew. <em>£185</em></p>  <p><strong>Speaqua Barnacle Vibe 2.0</strong></p> <p>This eye-catching <a href=\"https://speaqua.com/products/the-vibe-2-0\">speaker</a>, with an IP68 rating,&#xa0;plays music via Bluetooth from&#xa0;your phone, or independently with built-in storage for 2,000 tracks. There are eight hours of battery time and&#xa0;various mounting options, plus it floats. <em>$89.99</em></p><p>Source: Fergus Scholes 2021 'All-action kit for sailors' FT.com 18 June.
