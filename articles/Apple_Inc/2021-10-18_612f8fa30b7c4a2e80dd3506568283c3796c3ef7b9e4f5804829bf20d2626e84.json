  "text": "<p>Apple AAPL unveiled a new version of its entry-level AirPods earbuds featuring shorter stems, a wireless-charging case and longer battery life at a virtual event Monday. The company is also bringing spatial-audio capabilities, which aims to make sound more immersive, to the entry-level AirPods.</p><p>The third-generation AirPods, which will cost $179, will last for six hours on a single charge and feature a quick-charging function that offers one hour of battery life after just five minutes of charging.</p><p>Apple also announced new yellow, blue and orange color options for its $99 HomePod mini smart speakers. In addition, the company revealed a cheaper “voice” plan for its Apple Music service, which will let people tap the company's catalog of songs for $4.99 when they access it through Siri. This option is cheaper than the traditional $9.99 version of Apple Music but seems to withhold some in-app conveniences of tinkering with the app by hand.</p><p>The new AirPods and colorful HomePod mini speakers will be the latest addition to Apple's device lineup, which also includes the iPhone 13 line announced last month. The company once again revealed four new phones with an emphasis on enhanced video and camera functions. The iPhones have a “cinematic” filming function that generates better-quality footage.</p><p>Apple also announced new Apple Watch devices with larger screens as well as new iPads at it September event.</p><p>Shares of Apple were up 0.8% in Monday afternoon trading. They've gained 22.6% over the past 12 months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , which counts Apple as a component, has increased 23.2%.</p>",
