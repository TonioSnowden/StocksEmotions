  "text": "<p>Nothing.</p><p>\"Don't expect any pre-commitment on magnitude of rate hikes and continue to keep options open,\" writes Mr. Blonde, who has been moving to a \"more neutral tactical view\" over the past few weeks on expectations of more \"two-way risk\" from here out. He identifies himself as a former equity strategist at a major firm and an advisor to a long/short hedge fund.</p><p>\"Bottom line, Mr. Blonde feels tactically neutral at current levels with a core view that remains defensive. Shorting the FOMC meeting feels a bit too obvious, but chasing a +10% moves has not been rewarded this year. Sometimes it's best to sit back, observe and wait for direction,\" he said.</p><p>Like many, Mr. Blonde doesn't see the Fed braking on rates until it is confident inflation is moving toward target, with any discussion on that unlikely until the first quarter of next year.</p><p>\"Expect S&amp;P 500 price stalls around 17.5x forward P/E, which currently equates to ~4075 (or +4%) based on consensus EPS of $233 (and falling) for 2023. Why 17.5x? Historically, valuation multiples compress as long as the Fed is hiking rates (yes even if hiking at slower pace) and rolling 2yr average acts as an area of resistance,\" he said.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX ended Tuesday at 3856.</p><p>While the technical backdrop has improved and another 4% move higher for the S&amp;P 500 isn't impossible — leaving 80% of stocks above their 50-day average on par with mid-August highs — a Fed pivot may be needed to propel stocks higher, and that's unlikely, he said.</p><p>His below table shows that periods of falling next twelve months (NTM) EPS \"are typically bad backdrop for equities with average 3mo returns of -3.7% and positive returns less than 40% of the time, both significantly below average. Selling rallies is a favorable strategy.\"</p><p>Mr. Blonde also points out that doing nothing is more rewarding than it used to be, with U.S. 6-month Treasury bills BX:TMUBMUSD06M offering a 4.6% yield, not bad when stacked up against BBB corporate cash credit yield of 6.5%.</p><p>\"This is a meaningful adjustment within capital markets and one that is likely to be felt over the course of several quarters as multiasset managers gradually, but consistently, shift toward no volatility, modest return offered by cash,\" says Mr. Blonde.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stock futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 are mostly flat, along with bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, with the dollar DXY lower. Oil prices CL.1 BRN00 are also down.
