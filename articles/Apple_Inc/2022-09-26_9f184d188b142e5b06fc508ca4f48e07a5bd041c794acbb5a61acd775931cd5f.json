  "text": "<p>Following Ed's last note on how the west overestimated Vladimir Putin, I want to return to the theme of autocrats behaving badly.</p> <p>I have been watching very carefully the anti-government protests in Iran, which sprang up over the past few days following the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. The woman, Mahsa Amini, had been arrested by the country's odious “morality police” for having her headscarf out of place. For those who don't know, these supposed law enforcers are very often angry young men or even teens with AK-47s and not enough to do. She collapsed while in custody and later died. A very doctored tape released by the regime makes it look like an accident, and authorities are claiming the young woman had heart trouble prior to being hauled to the police station. But the family has denied this, and pictures taken by someone in the hospital where she was later treated make it seem quite possible that she was beaten or suffered some kind of inflicted head injury.</p> <p>Whatever the case, the tragedy has sparked a powder keg. Anti-regime protests are spreading, not only through dozens of cities in Iran, but among Iranian expats outside the country. See here <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jiyargol/status/1572704133961891847?s=11&amp;t=Bd5GuSDdNxbz77uSve09oQ\">a very powerful speech</a> given at one rally by the New York-based Iranian journalist and human rights activist <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-exiled-dissident-fuelling-the-hijab-protests-in-iran\">Masih Alinejad</a>, who also happens to be my children's stepmother. As a key anti-regime activist, she herself has been the subject of a recent assassination attempt, following an attempted kidnapping that was foiled by the FBI last year (yes, it has been a total horror, not only for her, but for our entire family).</p> <p>So far, at least seven protesters and five members of security forces have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/448dbe98-0002-488f-9480-612ac3e2edc0\">killed inside the country</a> in this latest crackdown. But people are still rallying, burning headscarves and challenging the authorities to kill them, too. The long and short of it is that people in Iran are sick of living this way. They are sick of the regime, and I think they are pretty close to being ready for change.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in China last week, a bus transporting people in the south-western city of Guiyang to a Covid-19 quarantine facility rolled over and crashed, killing 27 people. A large online protest followed, during which people questioned why they were giving Beijing the power to keep imprisoning them, as part of an unsuccessful zero-Covid policy, for nearly three years. While online protests — which are somewhat tolerated in China unlike real life ones — aren't the same as marches or gunfire in the streets, the stark anti-government comments and the sheer volume of them struck me as important. As in Iran, people in China are exhausted and frayed by a failed policy that is depriving them of their liberty.</p> <p>The question is, what happens? Let's start with Russia. Ed, you sounded optimistic about the situation in Ukraine in your last note. But I felt anxious reading Putin's latest threats about using any means necessary to keep Russia safe — as he put it, “this isn't a bluff”. We all know the strategic reasons why there shouldn't be a nuclear war. That doesn't mean that we are dealing with a sane or rational person on the other side of the table. Does this worry you as well?</p> <p>Putin is much more of a wild card than Xi Jinping, or Iran's Supreme Leader. But China has become much more focused on national security than even growth, which is new, and the Iranian regime has proven that it's willing to put its own people through almost any amount of pain to keep power.</p> <p>We in the media focus a lot on how strongmen are having their day, but they are also being increasingly challenged by their own populations, in part through the power of social media (regimes keep shutting down the internet, but people keep finding ways to stay connected). As our colleague John Thornhill noted in a recent column, 65 per cent of the world's population had internet access as of 2021, and that number <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4df65b03-818d-40ed-ae6b-9f0ec1ed2fac\">will probably rise to 100 per cent by 2030</a>. </p> <p>We know digital communications have helped enable autocrats. But will they also bring more of them down in the future? Ed, I'm curious about your answer to that question, and whether you have any thoughts on the protests I've mentioned, and what they herald?</p> <h1>Recommended reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>I read this New York Times review of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/27/books/review/american-rascal-greg-steinmetz.html\"><em>American Rascal: How Jay Gould Built Wall Street's Biggest Fortunes</em></a> and can't wait to read the book about the early 20th century robber baron.

For Swampians who don't know about her, Alinejad is the global face of the anti-hijab campaign and is extraordinarily courageous. I can quite imagine how traumatic it must have been for her and your children. I have watched the Iranian protests in awe at their bravery and the righteousness of their cause. Every regime maintains power through the confidence trick of appearing to be impregnable. If enough people can somehow find the courage to challenge it, anything is possible. We saw that in the Arab Spring in 2011 and in the Philippines' “people power” uprising that toppled the Marcoses in 1986. A women's-led Iranian revolution to overturn the decidedly&#xa0;male one that has been oppressing them for more than four decades would be an earthquake that would inspire people around the world. But we should not overestimate their odds. That the Iranian government would attempt to kidnap Alinejad from her home in New York shows both the power of her cause and the lengths&#xa0;to which Tehran will go to suppress dissent.&#xa0;</p> <p>Is technology the people's friend&#xa0;or the regime's? I suppose it depends. For a time, we bought the techno-utopian line that the iPhone was a democratic tool in every person's hands. Iran's failed “green revolution” in 2008 put paid to that somewhat one-way reading of the power of social media. As China has shown, and Putin is attempting to show, a regime can build a firewall to keep out foreign influence and close down internal dissent fairly quickly. That is why private encrypted messaging systems, such as Telegram, are so popular in countries like Iran. In theory, Iran could go full North Korea approach and just take the whole nation offline. In practice, that would ruin Iran's economy and might well trigger even more protests. So the jury is out on the political nature of technology. The same applies to the Russian protests (since you asked). Yes, I'm worried about Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling but I don't think he's suicidal. The fact that he's resorting to such crude threats is a measure of how badly the war is going for Russia. At some point soon I hope the universe, or the Russian people, will delete Putin's account. But I'm not betting on it.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a16eb6fe-dbbe-45d0-8f70-cc9baf6ef01c\"><strong>‘Believe your eyes: Russia is losing badly'</strong></a><strong>:<br></strong>“I think we are now seeing the beginning of an end of Putin and, maybe, the whole Putin era. The latest ill-conceived efforts by Putin &amp; Co to salvage the situation and not to lose face are more akin to the proverbial dead cat bounce than a show of true power. He is not likely to stop until the end — whatever that would happen to be . . . is reached. Putin's mind is set, and he is determined to drag down not just his cronies but the whole country. It's surprising that, say, oligarchs could not find a way to stop that self-destructing juggernaut. Are they really that scared or ignorant? Or is the current path Russia is on a part of the elaborate plan to ‘help' the current government to destroy itself from within? If it is, it seems to be working.” <em>— Alexander Peschkoff, London</em></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar 2022 'A no good, very bad week for autocrats' FT.com 26 September.
