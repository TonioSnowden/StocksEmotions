  "text": "<p>China's gross domestic product grew <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b0e09fb-1e02-4537-a44b-7b33cd43ba48\">at its slowest pace in 18 months</a> in the fourth quarter as the government grapples with a slowdown in the crucially important property sector and tries to eradicate all coronavirus cases.</p> <p>Gross domestic product expanded 4 per cent year on year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed today, exceeding economists' forecasts but short of the 6.5 per cent growth over the same period in 2020.</p> <p>The People's Bank of China also cut an important lending rate for the first time since April 2020, adding to a series of easing measures over recent months that have coincided with a property slowdown and restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The data and policy move indicated a continuing loss of momentum across China's economy, which recovered from the initial impact of the virus far more quickly than other big economies but has struggled to maintain its pre-pandemic growth rate over the past year.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Credit Suisse chair resigns over Covid breaches</strong> António Horta-Osório has resigned as chair of Credit Suisse after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48d159bd-a3c0-4025-8c5b-d7dfbf59526a\">a board investigation</a> found that he had breached coronavirus quarantine rules more than once. “I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,” Horta-Osório said in a statement last night.</p> <p><strong>2. Unilever defends £50bn bid for GSK consumer health unit</strong> The maker of Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Domestos bleach <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77efdd90-7a56-46aa-ab39-b72ec68260b2\">has defended</a> its £50bn bid for the consumer health unit of GlaxoSmithKline. The ambitious bid, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30070969-71bc-4ef9-a035-45d589b6fefe\">unveiled over the weekend</a>, drew scepticism from some analysts and sent the group's shares down 6 per cent in morning trading in London.</p> <p><strong>3. Top performing hedge funds of 2021</strong> Large profits at Ken Griffin's Citadel and Sir Christopher Hohn's TCI made them among the best-performing hedge fund managers of last year. Izzy Englander's Millennium Management and Paul Singer's Elliott Management were also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c155a678-8f38-4f95-b4ed-1fe6473804de\">on the list</a>, compiled by LCH Investments.</p> <p><strong>4. Macau casino shares rally</strong> The shares of casino operators with operations in Macau shot higher today after officials said they would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebf985b5-9a83-4282-be60-43dce9168df2\">maintain the number of licences</a> available to gaming operators in the Chinese territory, ending years of uncertainty for US companies such as Sands China, MGM China and Wynn Macau.</p> <p><strong>5.

But, according to critics, the $157bn Japanese company could never quite make the orchestra play in harmony. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70877521-29f6-406f-ae13-b1fdfc837eed\">That now appears to be changing</a>. </p> <p><strong>Leon Black targets New York elite in fight against rape claim</strong>&#xa0;The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5146672c-73b6-43df-b25d-e0162ad3d6a2\">legal battle</a> between Leon Black and his former mistress&#xa0;Guzel Ganieva has drawn in at least half a dozen law firms and threatens to embroil other wealthy figures in the worlds of finance and sport as the billionaire financier demands access to private records involving some of New York's most prominent businessmen. </p> <p><strong>How serious is Vladimir Putin about launching a major Ukraine offensive?</strong> If Russia ever wanted to renew its invasion of Ukraine, all signs point to that moment being now.
