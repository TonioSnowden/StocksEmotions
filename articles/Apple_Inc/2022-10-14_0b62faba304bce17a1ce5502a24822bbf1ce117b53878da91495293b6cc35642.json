  "text": "<p>In our previous four installments, we noted 20 moments and trends that made a big impact on the financial markets that we cover each day. From the emergence of online brokersto the financial crisis, and the rise of China, shale oil, passive investing and ESG, the first 20 MarketWatch moments reshaped financial markets.</p><p>But MarketWatch is turning 25 years old, not 20, and the events of the last five years have kept our newsroom exceptionally busy. Let's look at the five most recent big developments — events 21 to 25 — that the MarketWatch newsroom has had to grapple with in these latest wild years in the market.</p><p>21. FAANG and the longest bull market in history</p><p>Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google. The longest bull market in history started in 2009 as the financial crisis was raging and ended nearly 11 years later as the pandemic struck. During that time, it often seemed like investors only wanted to buy a few gigantic tech companies. CNBC personality Jim Cramer popularized a term for them: FANG. The acronym later expanded to FAANG.</p><p>It wasn't the first time market behavior could be boiled down to a bumper sticker phrase. In the 1960s, the Nifty Fifty of blue-chip stocks like Dow Chemical and Eastman Kodak ruled the stock market. But in the 2010s, big tech companies captivated investors. In addition to FAANG, high-growth names like Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA dominated market gains.</p><p>For much of its run, MarketWatch often noted, the bull market was hated by many market participants. It was partly fueled by monetary stimulus and index funds that didn't pay fat fees to Wall Street.</p><p>Nevertheless, the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed from 676 in March 2009 to 3,386 in February 2020. It took a pandemic to stop the bull run. As stocks dropped in early March 2020, MarketWatch wondered if the bull market would turn 11 before the developing coronavirus selloff. It did not.</p><p>22. Brexit</p><p>The surprise British vote to exit the European Union rocked global financial markets in June 2016 – and was an early indication of new political realities in liberal democracies that were starting to turn their back on globalization. A few months later, American voters would elect Donald Trump to the White House.</p><p>Stocks around the world plunged and the British pound dived to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar after news broke that 51.9% of Britons voted to leave the EU following four decades in the trade bloc. Boris Johnson, now the U.K.'s prime minister, was among the most prominent Brexiteers, likening an exit from the EU to an escape from prison.</p><p>MarketWatch reported that appeals to national pride and even nostalgia had roles in \"leave\" pitches, with English actress and Brexit supporter Liz Hurley saying she yearned for having a \"gorgeous navy blue\" passport again, rather than one in the EU's burgundy color. On the other hand, one ordinary Londoner told MarketWatch that she campaigned for the \"in\" camp partly out of concern that Brexit could unsettle factions in Northern Ireland. That \"remainer\" made the comments amid a downpour by the Queensway Tube station on the day of the vote. The heavy rains were viewed as helpful for the \"leave\" side because its voters appeared more determined and likelier to brave bad weather to cast their ballots.</p><p>MarketWatch's coverage featured one staffer in London pulling an all-nighter to cover the market mayhem, as well as Facebook Live broadcasts that broke down what had just happened. We also reported on Brexit's costly impact on London's big banks, its fintech scene and the EU millennials working in the U.K., along with how it befuddled bookies and ended up delivering a currency-related boost to the FTSE 100.</p><p>23. The COVID crash</p><p>It was the day the economy stood still — and then started to collapse.</p><p>On March 13, 2020, the fast-spreading coronavirus forced then-President Donald Trump to declare a public health emergency. Citizens from many foreign countries were blocked from entering the U.S. and Americans traveling abroad were subject to quarantines.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 19% on the day of the president's somber announcement, just a month after hitting a record high. It would keep sinking for the next week and, as MarketWatch noted, cap off the worst bear market in more than a decade.</p><p>A steadily growing economy was also thrown into abrupt reverse. The U.S. contracted sharply in March and April after state lockdowns and strict limits on public gatherings were put in place. Gross domestic product shrank 5.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and a whopping 31.2% in the second quarter, plunging the U.S. into its first recession in 11 years and one of the deepest in history. Twenty million jobs vanished.</p><p>It could have been worse if not for the rapid reaction by the Federal Reserve and Washington. Just days after the president''s emergency declaration, the central bank cut a key interest rate to zero. It also took other dramatic steps to slash borrowing costs and keep businesses from failing.</p><p>Congress and the White House followed up with increased benefits and other stimulus for households and companies to keep the economy afloat.</p><p>It worked. The Dow bottomed out at 19,173 in late March, 35% below its mid-February peak. Yet by early April, stocks embarked on what would become a nearly two-year bull market that drove the Dow above 36,000.</p><p>Then the economy started growing again.</p><p>All the stimulus from Washington, however, would come with a hidden cost. The flood of spending and record low interest rates later contributed to high inflation — the highest in 40 years.</p><p>24. Meme stocks and online trading boom redux</p><p>Mix together COVID-19 lockdowns, government stimulus checks, a torrent of central-bank liquidity, the advent of zero-commission trading and a new generation of investors versed in online gambling and other Internet pursuits — and you get a new boom in retail investing.</p><p>Retail traders accounted for more than 20% of daily stock-market volume at one point in 2021, up from around 10% in 2019, according to market-structure experts. But the frenzy that took hold in early 2021, as investors organized on Reddit and other platforms to take aim at GameStop GME and other heavily shorted \"meme stocks,\" was far different in flavor from the 1990s dot-com boom. The point for these traders was to punish Wall Street, particularly short sellers, and make money by going long heavily shorted stocks. Options trading also surged, with investors snapping up out-of-the-money calls, adding to the squeeze.</p><p>Keith Gill became the face of the revolution. The office worker made tens of millions and created a cult following through his \"Roaring Kitty\" and \"DeepF***ingValue\" personas on YouTube and Reddit's WallStreetBest forum. The Reddit traders used no-cost trading platforms, like Robinhood Markets, and the activity took a toll on some Wall Street heavyweights, with Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital eventually winding down. While meme stock traders didn't invent the short squeeze, such retail \"wolf packs\" were a new phenomenon, market veterans observed.</p><p>Ultimately, meme stocks crashed back to earth and many new traders were left holding the bag. Meanwhile, some hedge funds minted money trading with and against the meme-stock frenzy, while market makers, like Citadel Securities —another villain to the Reddit crowd—also raked it in.</p><p>That said, not all of the surge in retail trading was due to the meme-stock frenzy, with analysts noting that many traders proved nimble in navigating the market's ups and downs. It would be a mistake, they argued, to assume that the millions of new accounts opened in the midst of the pandemic will simply evaporate.</p><p>25. The return of inflation and a bear market</p><p>Don't worry, high inflation is just temporary. That's what the experts told the public.They were wrong.</p><p>The warning signs were there. Former Democratic Treasury Secretary Larry Summers predicted in early 2021 that massive government stimulus would stoke inflation. And a MarketWatch article around the same time suggested inflation was ready to rise.</p><p>But no one predicted inflation would surge as much as it did. After falling to zero early in the pandemic, inflation crept higher. Then it hit overdrive. The yearly rate of inflation zoomed from just 1.4% at the start of 2021 to a 40-year peak of 9.1% by June 2022.</p><p>Finally recognizing its error, the Federal Reserve stopped calling inflation \"transitory.\" Then in March it began raising interest rates for the first time since 2018. The Fed had slashed rates during the pandemic to shore up a collapsing economy, but it may have done its job too well. Record-low borrowing costs and trillions of dollars in government stimulus ignited a consumer spending binge.</p><p>Businesses were unprepared to keep up. They slashed production early in the pandemic and didn't expect demand to recover so quickly. Ongoing disruptions in the global trading system added to the misery. Businesses couldn't get enough supplies and the prices of almost everything rose. With their own costs rising, they started charging customers more. Adding fuel to the fire, the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year drove up oil and grain prices and forestalled a hoped-for decline in inflation.</p><p>Now the Fed is trying to undo the damage. The central bank is jacking up rates much faster than it planned. The fear on Wall Street is palpable: A bear market has gripped stocks again. How come? Rising interest rates are expected to slow the economy, dent corporate profits and trigger another recession.</p><p>MarketWatch Moments: From meme stocks to inflation, the biggest market events of the last five years</p>",
