  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Foxconn Technology Group is scrambling to contain a weekslong Covid-19 outbreak at an iPhone factory in central China, trying to appease frightened and frustrated workers during a crucial period for smartphone orders. </p><p>   In Foxconn's main Zhengzhou facility, the world's biggest assembly site for Apple Inc.'s iPhones, hundreds of thousands of workers have been placed under a closed-loop system for almost two weeks. They are largely shut off from the outside world, allowed only to move between their dorms or homes and the production lines. </p><p>   Many said they have been confined to their quarters for days and that distribution of food and other essentials has been chaotic. Many others say they are too scared to carry on working because of the risk of getting infected. </p><p>   Foxconn denied what it said were online rumors that 20,000 cases had been detected at the site and said that for \"the small number of employees affected by the pandemic,\" it is providing necessary supplies. </p><p>   \"A sudden outbreak disrupted our normal life,\" Foxconn said on Friday in a post to its workers on WeChat, a social-media platform. \"An orderly progress in both pandemic prevention and output depends on the efforts of all staff,\" it said. </p><p>   It outlined plans to ensure proper food supplies and mental well-being support and pledged to respond to workers' concerns. </p><p>   Asked about the workers' details of the situation at the site, Foxconn didn't respond. </p><p>   \"It's too dangerous to go to work,\" a 21-year-old worker who has been confined to his dorm told The Wall Street Journal, saying he was skeptical about the company's claim that there was a low level of infections at the plant. </p><p>   The disruption at Foxconn is the latest example of the economic and societal toll from China's rigid pandemic-control policies. </p><p>   Foxconn says it employs as many as 300,000 workers in Zhengzhou. </p><p>   Some analysts estimate that the company produces half or more of Apple's smartphones in the city, making it vital for delivering iPhones to consumers, including for the coming winter holiday season when demand for the handsets typically spikes. </p><p></p>",
