  "title": "Amnesty International Exits Hong Kong, Citing National Security Law; Human-rights group says authorities' crackdown on dissent makes maintaining operations in city unworkable",
  "text": "<p>\"This decision, made with a heavy heart, has been driven by Hong Kong's national security law, which has made it effectively impossible for human rights organizations in Hong Kong to work freely and without fear of serious reprisals from the government,\" Anjhula Mya Singh Bais, chair of Amnesty's International board, said in a statement.</p><p>Amnesty's exit follows a wave of closures by local trade unions and other civil-society organizations amid a crackdown on dissent by authorities. Amnesty was one of a large number of prominent human-rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations that operated openly for decades in Hong Kong before the security law's enactment.</p><p>Despite the former British colony being formally part of China since 1997, the territory initially enjoyed a larger degree of autonomy and greater personal freedoms than on the mainland, guaranteed by China under the \"one country, two systems\" model. Many of those rights are being rolled back as Beijing asserts more control over Hong Kong following mass and sometimes violent antigovernment protests that rocked the city for seven months in 2019.</p><p>In Hong Kong, Amnesty focused on human-rights education, including providing classroom talks, promoting an annual human-rights-themed documentary film festival and co-sponsoring a major regional journalism award.</p><p>A separate Amnesty office in Hong Kong worked on research and human-rights advocacy work across the region. Amnesty said it would close its local office by the end of October, and its regional office by the end of the year. It said the regional office's work will continue from new locations but didn't say where. More than 30 people worked for the organization's two offices in Hong Kong, a spokesman said.</p><p>\"Hong Kong has long been an ideal regional base for international civil society organizations, but the recent targeting of local human rights and trade union groups signals an intensification of the authorities' campaign to rid the city of all dissenting voices,\" Ms. Bais said. \"It is increasingly difficult for us to keep operating in such an unstable environment.\"</p><p>Amnesty said at least 35 groups have disbanded since the law was enacted, including major unions and activist groups.</p><p>A Hong Kong government representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The city's government and Beijing have said the law has restored order to the city following the tumultuous wave of protests.</p><p>Scores of people have been arrested under Hong Kong's new security law, which criminalizes terrorism, subversion of state power, secession and collusion with foreign forces. The law gave police sweeping new powers and authorities have targeted the city's political opposition, trade unions and groups and figures behind the protest movement.</p><p>In June, the city's main opposition newspaper, Apple Daily, was forced to cease publication after authorities seized its assets and jailed its founder, Jimmy Lai.</p><p>Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com</p><p>Amnesty International Exits Hong Kong, Citing National Security Law</p>",
