  "text": "<p>\n  Stashed in the back of any whole-animal butcher shop, a gold mine awaits the cook savvy enough to ask: bones, ready for transformation into a rich, nutritious broth. All you really need are bones, water, acid and salt. Simmered for hours, the bones break down, releasing collagen, gelatin, nutrients and minerals into an intense liquid. </p><p>\n  Denver butcher, nutritional therapist and farmer Kate Kavanaugh is one of the country's leading evangelizers for what she calls the \"mother potion.\" She considers bone broth \"the skeleton, the foundation, the backbone of my kitchen and many of my nutritional protocols.\" </p><p>\n  A vegetarian for years, Ms. Kavanaugh resumed eating meat after experiencing some health issues. Soon she started to visit with farmers and ranchers to understand how she could consume meat more sustainably. Eventually she learned butchery, and she opened Western Daughters Butcher Shoppe in Denver in 2013. Everything sold at the shop is sourced within 100 miles. The beef is 100% grass-fed and grass-finished. Lamb, pork and poultry are pasture-raised. The shop also purveys bones, along with Ms. Kavanaugh's bone broth on tap. </p><p>\n  The butcher herself teaches a virtual bone broth class, a deep-dive into nutrition, sourcing, cooking and equipment. She prefers beef bones, but she emphasized that lamb, pork or poultry bones all work well. She likes neck and knuckle bones in particular. \"They make really unctuous broth,\" she said. Heads and feet are also great for producing a nice, viscous consistency. </p><p>\n  Ask your butcher to cut the bones into chunks that will fit easily into the pot you will use (1 1/2 - to 2-inch pieces, typically). To roast or not to roast the bones beforehand? Up to you. Have some vegetable scraps on hand? Toss them in! Follow the steps at right as a guide to make your own signature \"mother potion,\" which in turn can be used as a base for soups, sauces and stews; as an element for deglazing, poaching and braising; or on its own as a beverage to warm and fortify you through cold days and stressful times. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ultimate Bone Broth </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Total Time: 5-48 hours (depending on the pot you use) </p><p>\n  Makes: 3 1/2 quarts </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  What You'll Need: </p><p>\n  Stock pot, pressure cooker or slow cooker </p><p>\n  Roasting pan or baking sheet </p><p>\n  Strainer </p><p>\n  3 1/2 pounds grass-fed and grass-finished beef neck and knuckle bones, cut into 1 1/2 - to 2-inch pieces </p><p>\n  3 1/2 quarts water </p><p>\n  2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar, another fruit-based vinegar, or citrus juice </p><p>\n  Salt </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Step 1: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place bones on baking sheet and roast until golden brown, 1-2 hours. (Time will vary depending on size of bones.) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Step 2: Place roasted bones in a 6-quart pressure cooker, slow cooker or stock pot. Add water and vinegar. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Step 3: Pressure cook on high 4-8 hours, and allow natural release. Or simmer in slow cooker on low or stock pot on stovetop 24-48 hours. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Step 4: Finished broth should be viscous and between golden and light brown. When ready, strain out bones and solids. Discard bones. Salt to taste. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Step 5: Transfer broth to a heatproof jar or jars. Let cool and seal with lid. Stock will keep 3-5 days in the refrigerator, or 1 year frozen. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Pro Tips </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. Bones will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days and in the freezer, tightly wrapped in butcher paper or vacuum-sealed, at least 6 months. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. Bones or broth with an off smell or visible mold have gone rancid and should be discarded. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. Store broth in the freezer in silicone ice trays or in glass Weck or Ball jars. </p><p>\n  -- Adapted from Kate Kavanaugh </p><p></p>",
