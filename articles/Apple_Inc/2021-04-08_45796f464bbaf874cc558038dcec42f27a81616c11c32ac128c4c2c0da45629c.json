  "text": "<p>The days are gone of 5G being a premium feature of $1,000-plus smartphones, and the Nokia X10, the latest offering from HMD Global <a href=\"https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/love-trust-keep\">unveiled today</a> for Europe, costs £250 (€309).</p> <p>Even that price is higher than the £229 special offer at launch for the realme 7 5G handset last November, and a CCS Insight research note says the “democratisation” of 5G is well under way, with component designs that are driving down costs.</p> <p>It expects<a href=\"https://www.ccsinsight.com/press/company-news/weak-outlook-for-mobile-phones-in-2021-before-recovery-in-2022/\"> one in three handsets </a>sold in 2021 to be 5G-enabled, equivalent to over half a billion units, and puts 5G adoption 12 to 18 months ahead of where 4G was at the same point a decade earlier, with less confusion over standards this time around. </p> <p>Consumers are probably not aware though of the compromise on standards they are making in buying cheaper phones — CCS says savings are being made by offering fewer bands for connections and excluding millimetre-wave technology that enables multigigabit-per-second speeds. Some bands and millimetre-wave are not available anyway in many markets yet, so users may not be deprived of much here. </p> <p>HMD has an added weapon in competing with other value-priced phonemakers — it announced today it was launching as an operator as well, something of a first for a handset maker.</p> <p>It will be a virtual operator (MVNO) in the UK, launching as HMD Mobile this month, with plans for a gradual global rollout. “The growth in online sales as a result of the pandemic has seen a shift in where phones are sold, and being able to marry airtime with the device and offer the combined package at a single price will allow HMD Global to take a slightly different approach to rival smartphone makers,” commented CCS Insight chief analyst Ben Wood.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a shame they haven't called it the Nokia network, but the telecoms network equipment supplier of the same name would surely have objected. You can read more about the new phones in Tech Tools below.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. US plan for global tax</strong><br>The Biden administration is calling for the world's biggest multinational companies, including Big Tech, to pay levies to national governments based on their sales in each country, as part of an ambitious proposal for a global minimum tax, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/847c5f77-f0af-4787-8c8e-070ac6a7c74f\">the FT has discovered</a>. Chris Giles looks at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b358ebca-4097-4cd6-bc7f-8e9d8f069250\">how it would work</a>.</p> <p><strong>2. The Epic-Apple papers</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/914ce719-f538-4bd9-9fdf-42220d857d5e\">Legal documents</a>, released ahead of Apple's court battle with Epic Games next month, include a senior Apple engineer comparing the defences of its App Store against malicious actors to “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gunfight”. Apple's defence of the 30 per cent it levies on app purchases is partly that it protects consumers from malware.</p> <p><strong>3. Uber and Lyft's driver incentives</strong><br>Faced with a lack of supply to meet a rebound in passengers, the ride-sharing companies are resorting to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b71e009-bb96-46ee-b024-4c574ef41988\"> “throwing money”</a> at drivers. Uber has announced it will spend $250m on what it described as a one-time “stimulus” package to increase incentives for its drivers in the US.</p> <p><strong>4. ShareChat gains share from China app ban</strong><br>Indian social media firm ShareChat has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a5e44e2-b2c0-4f37-9c4a-f51c6ef46eb6\">raised more than half a billion </a>dollars to grow its popular short-video app Moj, just months after the Indian government banned ByteDance-owned rival TikTok from the country. Its ShareChat app has 160m monthly active users, while Moj has already amassed more than 120m monthly active users within nine months of its launch.</p> <p><strong>5. A solid case for next-gen batteries</strong><br>Solid-state batteries&#xa0;are safer and use fewer raw materials than lithium-ion batteries that drive the modern world. Are they the answer to technology's power problem and a threat to Tesla's dominance? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4e075b8-7289-4756-9bfe-60bf50f0cf66\">asks this in-depth Lex</a>.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Nokia's affordable smartphones</h2> <p>Finland's HMD Global is the exclusive licensee of the Nokia phone brand and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/nokia-announces-6-new-android-phones-and-lite-earbuds\">unveiled six new models </a>on Thursday, its <a href=\"https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/love-trust-keep\">biggest launch to date.</a> The C10 and C20 are budget Android phones costing just €75 and €89, but still feature 6.5in HD screens and all-day battery life. The G10 and G20 are €139 and €159 and feature three-day battery life and better cameras. The X10 and X20 are its top of the range at €309 and €349, with 5G, Zeiss optics for the cameras and higher definition 6.67in screens.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 '5G for the masses' FT.com 8 April.
