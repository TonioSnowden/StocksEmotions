  "title": "Google Reaches $391.5 Million Settlement With States Over Location Tracking Practices; Consumers who disabled their location history settings were still tracked by Google, state attorneys general say",
  "text": "<p>\"Digital platforms like Google cannot claim to provide privacy controls to users, then turn around and disregard those controls to collect and sell data to advertisers against users' express wishes—and at great profit,\" said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin in a statement.</p><p>Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said the allegations were based on practices that it has already changed.</p><p>\"Consistent with improvements we've made in recent years, we have settled this investigation which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago,\" said José Castañeda, a Google spokesman.</p><p>The $391.5 million settlement, which the state attorneys said set a record for a multistate privacy case, comes amid heightened concerns over how internet platforms collect and use location data.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is currently considering a rule that would expand online privacy protections by targeting online surveillance and lax data-security practices by technology companies.</p><p>Congress is also considering bipartisan legislation to give Americans more control over their data. It passed a House committee last summer—a milestone—but has been hung up over concerns about how it could affect state efforts.</p><p>Some advocates said the $391.5 million settlement, which included the monetary payment as well as new transparency requirements and limits on use of location data, didn't go far enough. Google parent Alphabet reported revenue of $69.1 billion in its most recent quarter.</p><p>\"It's a big number, but not nearly as big as you'd hope for\" considering the millions of consumers affected, said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research and advocacy group.</p><p>Privacy advocates have urged policy makers to put more hard-and-fast limits on how companies handle sensitive data such as location information.</p><p>\"This weak deal will only fan the flames of privacy advocates calling for laws and regulations to rein in geolocation surveillance,\" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit that advocates for consumer protections online.</p><p>Location data has become a vital part of the digital ecosystem, particularly for online advertising businesses such as Google's. Google uses the data it collects on consumers to develop user profiles and target ads to them.</p><p>The attorneys general concluded that Google violated state consumer protections laws by deceiving consumers about its location practices. The settlement sets out several ways in which Google must become more transparent about its practices.</p><p>Google must show additional information to users whenever they turn a location-related account setting on or off, the attorneys general said. It also must make key information about location tracking prominent for users, and give users detailed information about the types of location data Google collects and how it is used at an enhanced \"Location Technologies\" webpage.</p><p>The settlement also limits Google's use and storage of certain types of location information and requires Google account controls to be more user-friendly.</p><p>The attorneys general opened the bipartisan investigation following press reports, including by the Associated Press, showing that Google recorded user movements even when users believed they had told it not to do so.</p><p>\"Big Tech is watching us, but Silicon Valley needs to know that we are watching them too,\" said Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.</p><p>The settlement comes as Congress continues to struggle over privacy legislation that could establish guardrails for how companies collect and use personal data online.</p><p>Google still faces lawsuits by the District of Columbia and several other states over aspects of its location tracking. Those suits were filed earlier this year. The D.C. suit alleges that Google falsely told customers that if they opted out of collection of their \"location history\" or other settings, Google wouldn't store the places they went.</p><p>The lawsuit claims Google tracks people's location across all smartphones, including Apple Inc.'s iPhones with iOS operating systems and devices from manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. that rely on Google's Android operating system.</p><p>The location data is collected by Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube and more, the complaint says, even when a user's location isn't needed to support the functionality of the service.</p><p>To back up its claims, the suit cites internal company documents, including one in which a Google employee allegedly says that the user interface for Google Account Settings \"feels like it is designed to make things possible, yet difficult enough that people won't figure it out.\"</p><p>Similar suits were being filed in Indiana, Texas and Washington state courts, according to state attorneys general there.</p><p>Write to John D.
