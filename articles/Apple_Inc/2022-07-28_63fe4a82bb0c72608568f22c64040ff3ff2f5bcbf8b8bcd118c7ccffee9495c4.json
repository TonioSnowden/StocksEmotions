  "text": "<p>Stock markets have started the third quarter in better form than the declines seen in the first half of the year. Corporate earnings haven't been as bad as investors had feared, suggesting that soaring inflation and signs of flagging economic growth aren't weighing too heavily on companies' balance sheets.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is serious about bringing inflation down. On Wednesday it raised its federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%.</p><p>Investors are looking to earnings figures from major blue-chip and technology companies Thursday for guidance. Tech giants Amazon and Apple are due to report earnings after markets close.</p><p>Ahead of the opening bell, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms fell 4.4% after reporting its first decline in revenue after hours Wednesday. Qualcomm declined 3.6% after issuing a muted sales outlook. Ford jumped 6.9% after reporting a 50% rise in revenue. Online marketplace operator Etsy gained 6.9% after it reported better-than-expected results.</p><p>Spirit Airlines shares were up 4% premarket after JetBlue Airways agreed to buy the carrier. The deal came after The Wall Street Journal reported that the two sides were close to sealing an agreement following a monthslong bidding war between JetBlue and Frontier Group Holdings. JetBlue shares rose 1.7%.</p><p>Pfizer rose 1.3% premarket after the pharmaceutical company reported profit and revenue that beat forecasts. Honeywell International rose 1.7% while Harley-Davidson jumped 5% after both reported better-than-expected earnings.</p><p>Southwest Airlines fell more than 4% after issuing mixed guidance and a warning about inflationary headwinds. Comcast slumped 5.3% after it said the number of subscribers to its Peacock service was little changed in the latest quarter.</p><p>Despite recent gains for major indexes, investors remain concerned about stretched valuations and fear the pace of Fed rate rises could prompt a recession. Many aren't ready to jump back into the market.</p><p>\"The rally we have seen looks like a classic bear market rally, rather than the launch of a new bull market,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"We are still going to have a period where inflation is uncomfortably high and growth is uncomfortably low and that is not a good backdrop.\"</p><p>Economic figures due Thursday will be crucial for gauging the trajectory of the economy, with gross domestic product data expected to show the economy narrowly avoided two consecutive quarters of negative growthâ€”a commonly used definition of a recession. Commerce Department data are expected to show GDP grew by 0.3% in the quarter that ended in June following a 1.6% decline in the first quarter.</p><p>New applications for unemployment benefits are forecast to have declined slightly in the week through Saturday, after reaching their highest level in eight months. The labor market has been a source of strength for the economy, which has helped dispel fears about a recession, though jobless claims have been ticking higher.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.785% from 2.731% on Wednesday. The yield on the 2-year note rose to 2.980% from 2.968%.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, rose 0.2%.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 2.4% to $104.16 a barrel. Gold prices gained 1.1%.</p><p>Overseas, European indexes were broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.6%, led by its mining stocks while telecommunication companies lost ground. Barclays shares fell more than 3% after saying its profits nearly halved in the second quarter after a bond-sale mistake.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.4%, while in China the Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.2%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong weakened 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Slip Ahead of Tech Earnings, GDP Data</p>",
