  "text": "<p>That size hits roughly in the middle of its earlier anticipated range of $4 billion to $6.5 billion, signaling healthy demand for the Apple debt deal in what can be a tepid summer month for new bond issuance.</p><p>\"Even though August is typically a slower issuance month,\" said Tom Murphy, head of investment grade credit at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, \"we estimate this year could be busier.\"</p><p>Murphy pointed to improved conditions for borrowers in the past month, but also ongoing macro uncertainties as potential catalysts for more robust issuance from highly rated U.S. companies in August.</p><p>The U.S. investment grade bond index rallied to a negative 11.6% total yearly return to end July, an improvement from its -16.1% performance in mid-June, he said.</p><p>Robust iPhone sales also have been a bright spot of quarterly corporate earnings so far, with some Wall Street analysts dubbing Apple's earnings \"resilient\" in the face of soaring prices for gas, groceries, vehicles, shelter and more.</p><p>Read: Big Tech survived the earnings test, but many more tech companies are picking up their pencils</p><p>Signs of buckling consumer demandwere found in earlier quarterly results from Walmart Inc. WMT and others. Companies like Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META also reported declining revenue as U.S. households juggle soaring costs and recession fears as the Federal Reserve works to tame inflation running at a four-decade high.</p><p>For investors, the Apple debt deal, split across 7-year, 10-year, 30-year and 40-year classes of bonds, comes after ahistorically bad start to 2022 that has left many corporate bonds trading with steep discounts.</p><p>The bonds now have been pegged to price at slightly more attractive levels for Apple, versus earlier price talk, another sign of healthy demand from investors. The bonds launched at a price range of 63 to 118 basis points above the risk-free Treasury rate, according to Informa Global Markets.</p><p>Initial price talk was 90 basis points to 150 basis points above the benchmark, according to a CreditSights report, which also noted that the iPhone accounted for 52% of Apple's sales in the past 12 months through its fiscal third quarter.</p><p>Proceeds from the saleof bonds will be used by Apple for general corporate purposes, including stock and bond repurchases and dividend payments.</p><p>Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Apple follows up robust earnings, swift iPhone sales with $5.5 billion debt deal</p>",
