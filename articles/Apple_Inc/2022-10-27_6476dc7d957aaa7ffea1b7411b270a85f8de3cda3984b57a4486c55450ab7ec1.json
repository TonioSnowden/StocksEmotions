  "title": "2023 Honda HR-V: A User-Friendly Crossover That's Just What You Need; Honda's redesigned compact crossover includes all the necessities at an affordable price, says Dan Neil, and now shares a vehicle architecture with the Civic.",
  "text": "<p>At a time when average transaction prices in the U.S. are hovering around $50,000, the Honda's number is strong. And I suppose the most monastically minded would opt for the base model with front-wheel drive, starting at $24,895. But for another five grand, the EX-L AWD trim includes all-wheel drive, leather seat upholstery, nine-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and wireless charging. Amortized over several incarnations, it's bupkis.</p><p>The EX-L trim also gets an exterior blackout kit (high-gloss honeycomb grille, bumper trim, door pillars) as well as 17-inch alloy wheels with machined finish. Not that pride-of-ownership should play any part in your decision.</p><p>Redesigned and replatformed, I guess, the HR-V now shares its underpinnings with the 11th-generation Honda Civic sedan. This change has a couple knock-on effects for the HR-V worth noting. To the good: The shared architecture—including independent multi-link rear suspension in place of the previous torsion-beam rear axle—is more mature and technically sophisticated. Over-the-road refinement is up, noise-vibration-harshness (NVH) is down.</p><p>The common Honda virtues are well represented: the sense of contact with the road; the of-one-piece build quality; the simple and spare cabin décor; the especially human-habitable seats. The HR-V features Honda's new Body Stabilizing Seats. It's too late for me. My contents have shifted.</p><p>The downside: The new HR-V casts a much larger shadow: 9.4 inches longer and 2.6 inches wider. That's over a wheelbase only 1.7 inches longer than before. As a result, the interior space of the new is scarcely better than the previous generation, despite the step up in exterior dimensions and weight (+191 pounds). HR-V offers 24.4 cubic feet of cargo space aft of the rear seats. With the rear 60/40-split seat backs folded flat, the cubic footage grows to 55.1. That's less capacity than segment peers Kia Seltos or VW Taos, for instance.</p><p>Also, the previous HR-V's second-row \"magic seat\" feature—the seat bottom would fold up to accommodate tall objects, such as plants—didn't survive the redesign.</p><p>The front and rear tracks (width between wheelsets) have also increased by 2.0/2.5 inches, respectively, which would theoretically translate to greater roll stability while cornering. A lot depends. These are the private agonies of vehicle engineers.</p><p>That said, the new HR-V wears its larger proportions well. For all the front overhang (forward of the front wheel center) the HR-V manages to avoid looking nose-heavy—as compared to schnozz-forward competitors like the Chevy Blazer and Toyota Corolla Cross. I have a theory as to why: These entrants have raised hoods and SUV-like faces, obviously to project an image of versatility. The HR-V's soft nose, level shoulderline, low cowl and hood height answer to entirely different criteria. These are artifacts of Honda's in-house pedestrian safety and vehicle compatibility standards, from which their design-engineers must not stray, oh no no. It's sort of baked into the brand.</p><p>Behind that cute little nose is a cute little engine: a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder, breathing through Honda's beloved variable timing valvetrain called i-VTEC (seriously, there is a Temple of VTEC fan club). Honda is getting 158-hp and 138 lb-ft of torque out of this free breather, and it likes a good revving. Max power arrives at 6,500 rpm.</p><p>Unfortunately for this petrol-breathed sprite, it will spend life harnessed to a continuously variable transmission, which rarely allows the engine to run hard for long, in the interests of fuel economy. On the government's scales, the HR-V EX-L gets 25/30/27 mpg, with no hybrid system and no idle/stop.</p><p>It would be easy, and not particularly dharma, to bag on CVTs. They can be annoying. But the HR-V's revised unit is an experiential non-issue, most of the time. You pull the gear selector into D and the rubber bands whirr. The engine's low-speed exertions are well isolated from the cabin and the throttle response/power pickup is almost indistinguishable from that of an ordinary stepped transmission.</p><p>Yes, if you floor the gas for a few seconds, as on a merging onramp, you will hear a distant, monk-like droning coming from the Temple of VTEC, but it's brief. In the control loops somewhere is Honda's Step-Shift programming, which simulates fixed-ratio upshifts under full load.</p><p>For 2023, the HR-V's front-biased all-wheel drive system has been revised to allow a bit more torque to the rear axles, if called for. Other foul-weather gear includes Hill Descent Control and a Snow drive mode, which changes throttle mapping and gear ratios, on the fly. One nice thing about CVTs....</p><p>Between one thing and another, the HR-V product embodies a lot of manufacturing expedience, but it's commonality done right. The handsome dashboard/front console design is now nearly identical with both Civic and CR-V. The visual centerpiece is the door-to-door band of honeycombed metal with brightwork trim, into which the air vents are integrated. The cut-and-sew components (dash and door upholstery) are excellent considering the price point.</p><p>Like the other two, the HR-V retains three-in-a-row physical buttons for its dual-zone climate control. The centrally mounted 9-inch touch screen features a physical volume knob and hard buttons for Home and Back functions. Of course the biggest, friendliest, most analog interface is the leather-wrapped PRNDL shifter.</p><p>When was the last time I saw one of those? It feels like a lifetime ago.</p><p>2023 Honda HR-V EX-L AWD</p><p>Price, as tested: $30,590</p><p>Powertrain: Naturally aspirated 2.0-liter I4 with variable valve timing and idle/stop; continuously variable transmission with three drive modes; front-biased, on-demand all-wheel drive.</p><p>Power/torque: 158 hp at 6,500 rpm/138 lb-ft at 4,200 rpm</p><p>Length/wheelbase/width/height: 179.8/104.5/72.4/63.4 inches</p><p>Curb weight: 3,333 pounds</p><p>0-60 mph: 9.4 seconds (Car and Driver)</p><p>EPA fuel economy: 25/30/27 mpg</p><p>Cargo capacity: 24.4/55.1 cubic feet, behind 2nd/1st row</p><p>2023 Honda HR-V: A User-Friendly Crossover That's Just What You Need</p>",
