  "text": "<p>But the speed with which it is spreading is presenting a different kind of challenge for policy makers, who are now weighing how to keep critical services functioning amid a wave of staff absences and enforced isolation periods.</p><p>The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. reached 198,405 on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Many states haven't reported new infections on some recent days because of the Christmas holidays. Those gaps and subsequent jumps as states bring recent infection data up-to-date are expected to complicate tracking of the Omicron variant's spread for some time, public-health experts said.</p><p>As of Monday, the seven-day average of patients in American hospital beds with confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases—including the Omicron and Delta variants—was above 71,000, according to the latest data posted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Businesses were adjusting to the challenges caused by rising Covid-19 cases, including for staffing. Apple Inc. said Monday that it was temporarily limiting access to almost 20 stores in the New York City area. The stores—closed to shoppers but open to customers picking up online orders—include the company's Fifth Avenue flagship. The move follows Apple's closure of several stores around the country amid increasing infections.</p><p>Meanwhile, flight cancellations in the U.S. continued Monday as inclement weather combined with Covid-19-driven airline staff shortages that marred the Christmas weekend for many travelers.</p><p>Data tracker FlightAware reported around 1,100 cancellations by midafternoon compared with more than 1,500 on Sunday, as some problems eased from the weekend.</p><p>Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration's top medical adviser, said Monday that U.S. officials should weigh a potential Covid-19 vaccination mandate for domestic air travel. \"That is just one of the requirements that I think is reasonable to consider,\" he said in an interview with MSNBC.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week revised its isolation and quarantine guidelines for healthcare workers who contract the virus—allowing them to go back to work after seven days, instead of 10 days, following a negative test. Other countries, including England, have made similar moves.</p><p>President Biden on Monday said his administration was working to address the testing shortage fueled by Omicron's spread. \"Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do,\" Mr. Biden said during a virtual briefing with governors.</p><p>The president last week said his administration would distribute 500 million free at-home Covid-19 testing kits and use the Defense Production Act to boost supply. Mr. Biden reiterated that Omicron poses the greatest threat to people who are unvaccinated.</p><p>\"This is not like March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic,\" he said. \"We're prepared and we know what it takes to save lives.\"</p><p>The U.S. Navy said Monday it had docked a destroyer at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii after a significant portion of the crew tested positive for Covid-19. The USS Halsey, which typically has a crew of about 300 officers and enlisted sailors, was the second Navy ship docked in the past week, following the littoral combat ship USS Milwaukee in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. About a quarter of the Milwaukee's fewer than 100 crew members tested positive, a defense official said.</p><p>Both crews were 100% vaccinated, the Navy said, but none of the sailors who tested positive had received a booster shot. According to the Navy, 98% of all sailors are vaccinated.</p><p>The infected Halsey sailors are being isolated, and the uninfected crew members remain aboard, the Navy said.</p><p>Israel's Sheba Medical Center began distributing a fourth vaccine to 150 medical personnel on Monday in a trial that will help the country understand the implications of starting a fourth jab for the elderly and immunosuppressed.</p><p>The trial, being carried out in conjunction with the Israeli Health Ministry, is testing a fourth shot on medical workers who had last been vaccinated in August and have low antibody counts.</p><p>\"This research is very important because we'll have initial data within a few days about the safety,\" said Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the infectious-disease epidemiology unit at Sheba Medical Center.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has supported the idea of a fourth vaccine as Omicron cases have risen and overall daily coronavirus cases rose to 1,760 on Sunday. Israel's panel of health experts last week approved of the idea of moving to a fourth vaccine, but the Health Ministry hasn't yet greenlighted the move.</p><p>Ran Balicer, head of Israel's national experts advisory committee on Covid-19 response, said Israel might move to authorize a fourth shot before results of the trial are in, pointing out that Israel was the first country to issue booster shots.</p><p>\"By the time the trial will yield results, things may have already substantially escalated further,\" he said.</p><p>In France on Monday, the government announced plans to lighten its isolation and quarantine guidelines for vaccinated people exposed to the virus in an effort to avoid snarling the economy as the outbreak worsens. French officials also said they would push employees to work remotely at least three days a week in many jobs, and aim to convert the country's health pass into a vaccine pass—meaning a recent negative test would no longer suffice to eat at a restaurant or go to the movies.</p><p>In the U.K., British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to decide early this week whether further restrictions should be introduced before New Year celebrations in England. The other U.K. countries, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have already moved to limit public and private gatherings to slow the spread of the virus, but Mr. Johnson is facing pressure from lawmakers from his ruling Conservative Party to avoid making similar moves.</p><p>China, meanwhile, is maintaining its zero-Covid policy of eradicating transmission of the virus ahead of the Winter Olympics. The northern city of Xian is now in its fifth day of lockdown after a cluster of cases was found there. Officials reported 150 new symptomatic infections there on Sunday, down slightly from 155 the day before as mass testing continued.</p><p>Sabrina Siddiqui, Anthony DeBarros, Nancy A.
