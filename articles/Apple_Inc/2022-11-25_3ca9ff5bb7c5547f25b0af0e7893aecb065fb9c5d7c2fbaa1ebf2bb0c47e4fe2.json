  "text": "<p>* All-wheel drive included</p><p>* Maximum range of 248 miles</p><p>* Performance version's boost function</p><p>* Powertrain and battery warranties of 10 years/100,000 miles</p><p>Cons</p><p>* A bit of a learning curve with the technology</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* The Genesis GV60 is all-new for 2023</p><p>* It's the first all-electric SUV from Genesis</p><p>* Also the first Genesis made in the United States</p><p>The all-new 2023 Genesis GV60 is an all-electric luxury compact SUV. It starts at $58,890.</p><p>Like every other Genesis, the 2023 Genesis GV60 comes with lots of standard equipment, including several features that would be optional in rivals — like a head-up display, a Bang &amp; Olufsen DK:BO audio system, and every major driver-assistance feature.</p><p>This new GV60 comes in Advanced AWD and Performance AWD variants, with AWD signifying all-wheel drive as standard. Maximum range is 248 miles.</p><p>This is also going to be the first Genesis to be built in the United States at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Alabama. The new GV60 shares a dedicated electric vehicle (EV) platform with the Hyundai HYMTF Ioniq 5 and Kia KR:000270 EV6. But the differences that make this a special Genesis model include several high-tech features, the aforementioned generous equipment inventory, and a lot of design flair.</p><p>2023 Genesis GV60 pricing</p><p>The Advanced AWD version of the 2023 GV60 electric SUV has a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $58,890, plus a destination charge. It's $67,890 for the Performance AWD model.</p><p>Apart from premium paint, there aren't many options.</p><p>A federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is applicable, plus any state incentives. Genesis adds three years of complimentary 30-minute fast-charging sessions using the Electrify America nationwide network. There's also three years of complimentary maintenance with a valet service, and the same for the Genesis Connected digital services subscription.</p><p>Initially, Genesis will sell the 2023 GV60 in California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, with other states phased in over time.</p><p>Other possible choices are the new-for-2023 Lexus RZ 450e (from around $50K, range: 225 miles), plus the Audi Q4 e-tron (mid-$40K, 241 miles), Volvo XC40 Recharge (mid-$50K, 223 miles), dual-motor Polestar 2 (low $50K, 248 miles) and the Tesla Model Y (low $60K, 318 miles). The Model Y is no longer eligible for any federal tax credit.</p><p>With the exception of the Tesla TSLA, rivals to the GV60 start out more affordable. But differences will shrink or evaporate when equipped to comparable levels.</p><p>Before buying a new Genesis GV60 all-electric SUV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. It's too early to talk about resale values yet, but Genesis vehicles generally tend to hold up quite well.</p><p>Read: 3 reasons the Hyundai Ioniq 6 makes the Tesla Model 3 seem a bit boring</p><p>Driving the 2023 Genesis GV60</p><p>Acceleration is phenomenal. Grip is phenomenal. The steering feels quick and precise, with a pleasant weight to it, even if it's not particularly informative. But let's back up a bit.</p><p>Finding the ideal driving position in the 2023 GV60 might take some time and several tweaks, despite 14-way power adjustability for the seat. The extendable under-thigh support is a welcome inclusion, however. The Performance model's front seats also have a lumbar massaging function that comes on automatically after an hour.</p><p>With the audio system turned off, the whine of the motors and general road noise become more noticeable. Better to turn the stereo on and enjoy the active noise cancellation. It is a Bang &amp; Olufsen setup, after all.</p><p>An adaptive suspension is fitted to the Performance AWD model. In the Comfort setting on a really rough road surface, there's a tendency for the car to pitch, with the front end going up and down. Many drivers will find Sport mode preferable in virtually every situation. And the Performance model's 21-inch alloy wheels don't have an adverse effect on ride quality.</p><p>Overall, the new GV60 SUV feels composed and eminently controllable. Especially when the brake regeneration starts slowing the vehicle — a benefit taken to its logical conclusion with the i-Pedal mode.</p><p>The highest degree of brake regeneration comes in eagerly and can bring the vehicle to a stop if the driver stays off the throttle. The benefits aren't just maximizing range along with immediate thrust and retardation in frenetic city driving. It can also be useful when blasting along a canyon road with one tricky corner after another.</p><p>And blasting is well within the GV60's capabilities. The Performance AWD model has the most horsepower, but its Advanced AWD stablemate has the same amount of torque (a meaty 446 lb-ft), so it's hardly going to be left in the dust. Well, not most of the time.</p><p>The horsepower advantage in the Performance AWD model is enhanced by an electronic limited-slip differential (E-LSD) at the rear and a boost function. The E-LSD allows drivers to get on the power early when exiting a corner, providing traction for the run to the next curve. Boost mode brings a 10-second jump from 429 horsepower to 483, with torque increased to 516 lb-ft. Accelerate along a straight, hit the Boost button on the steering wheel, and the GV60 becomes cartoonishly fast.</p><p>It takes a lot of pushing to get the tires squealing. When that happens, it's the fronts that fall progressively into giving up their grip. That's the safest option, so criticism would be churlish. But it seems like the GV60 only condones enthusiastic driving up to a point. It has the ability to manage beyond that point, yet then it feels like it's containing the driver's efforts rather than encouraging them.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Genesis calls it a Crystal Sphere gearshift, but if this crystal ball provides a vision into the future of the company's interiors, then things are going to be interesting. The shifter is in a \"floating\" center console.</p><p>This intriguing piece of tech is complemented by what is becoming an increasingly common dashboard feature, the single-unit housing two screens, both of beautifully high resolution in this new GV60 SUV. There's a 12.3-inch display for driver information and a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system. We're not crazy about the way the rectangular instrument cluster has its top corners obscured by the round steering wheel, but all the crucial information is visible.</p><p>The main color schemes are black or white/gray, although Performance trim also offers a navy blue option with yellow stitching, the same yellow as the Boost button on the steering wheel. The simulated leather includes polymers extracted from corn, and some fabrics use recycled plastics and nylon yarn. Another interesting touch is that the glove compartment is more like a drawer.</p><p>The front seats can recline to a well-judged position for drivers to grab a little rest and relaxation while the GV60 is charging.</p><p>Shorter than the Tesla Model Y and Audi Q4 e-tron, the new GV60 electric luxury SUV still manages to incorporate a relatively long wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear axles) for a decent amount of occupant space for what is really a compact vehicle.</p><p>Rear legroom is a respectable 37.6 inches. The main issue here is that if the driver's seat is set low, it's hard for passengers behind to slip their toes underneath. Cargo space behind the 60/40 split/folding rear seats measures 29 cubic feet. This increases to 57 cubic feet when those seats are both down.</p><p>Just under the rear seats is a power outlet — the Vehicle to Load feature — where users can charge laptops, run sound systems or even charge another electric vehicle. You can also access battery power from the external charging socket.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The long wheelbase and short overhangs give the GV60 electric SUV a pleasing profile. Genesis has also created arguably cool designs for the alloy wheels. Advanced trim has 20-inch wheels, and 21-inch alloys are fitted to the Performance model.</p><p>The chrome window surround (not too shiny) kinks into a V (for volt) at the rear pillars. Unusually, this surround also goes across the top of the windshield. Double headlights are echoed at the rear by dual taillights.</p><p>More of an SUV body style than anything else, the 2023 GV60 sticks with the contemporary trend of having a sloping roof. This compromises headroom a bit, but avoids the typical SUV boxiness. It drops down to a fixed rear spoiler.</p><p>There's a choice of 10 exterior colors, three of which are white. The more remarkable hues are Atacama Copper, Sao Paulo Lime, and Hanauma Mint (a green for people who don't usually like green).</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Crystal sphere gearshift This is original. When the new GV60 is at rest, systems off, the rotary gearshift is a glass dome with the same kind of fractal diamond pattern as the new Genesis badge on the hood. Turn the systems on, and the glass part rotates into the center console — like a high-tech beach ball in a swimming pool — to reveal something that looks more recognizable as a shift control.</p><p>Facial recognition Just like some smartphones recognize their owners' faces for functions like unlocking, the 2023 GV60 does the same thing. It's the first production car ever to include this feature. There's also a fingerprint reader inside to activate all the various systems.</p><p>Digital key Standard in the Performance AWD model, this gives several users access to a 2023 GV60 through their smartphone or smartwatch. No keys required, unless there's going to be some remote-controlled parking going on. It even works when the phone's battery is low.</p><p>Also read: What California's ban on gas cars could mean for you—even if you don't live there</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Starting with Advanced AWD trim, the 2023 GV60 compact electric luxury SUV has LED headlights/daytime running lights/taillights, rain-sensing wipers, self-dimming mirrors (inside and out), and a fixed glass roof with powered shade. For pure comfort and convenience, you get leather seating surfaces, heated/ventilated front seats, 14-way power-adjustable driver's seat/12-way front passenger seat (both with memory settings), dual-zone automatic climatic control, heated steering wheel, and hands-free tailgate operation.</p><p>Safety systems include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, head-up display, front/rear parking sensors, navigation-based adaptive cruise control, 360-degree camera system (with image capture), and a remote parking function.</p><p>The infotainment system brings Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, Amazon AMZN Alexa/Google Assistant compatibility, two USB-C ports up front, two USB-C ports for the rear passengers, wireless charging, satellite radio, over-the-air updates, user profiles saved to the cloud, 17-speaker/1,400-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>The Performance AWD version has more horsepower, the boost function, electronic limited-slip rear differential, adaptive suspension, Nappa leather seating surfaces, heated rear seats, and the Digital Key feature.</p><p>Check out: Men over 50: clean up your act with these style and grooming tips</p><p>Battery power, charge times, and range</p><p>The Advanced AWD version of the 2023 GV60 luxury SUV has a 99-horsepower electric motor driving the front wheels and a 215-horsepower motor turning the rears. Combined torque is 446 lb-ft.</p><p>The Performance AWD model has the same amount of torque, but with the bigger motor at both ends. A boost function pushes output to 483 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque for 10 seconds.</p><p>A lithium-ion polymer battery provides the spark for both versions. Hooked up to an 800-volt/250-kilowatt DC ultra-fast charger, this battery goes from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes. A 400-volt supply does the same job in 73 minutes. Or a home charging setup fed by 240 volts takes energy levels from 10% to 100% in seven hours or so. For a quick top-up, the 800-volt method can provide 64 miles of range in five minutes.</p><p>Maximum range is achieved by the Advanced AWD variant: 248 miles. But 235 miles from the Performance AWD model is still completely respectable.
