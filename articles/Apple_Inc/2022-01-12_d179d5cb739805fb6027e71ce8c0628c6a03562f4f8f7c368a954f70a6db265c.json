  "title": "In Montreal, a Beloved BBQ Restaurant That Defies Changes; At Chalet Bar-B-Q, one of Montreal's oldest chicken joints, the menu is nearly as lean as it's been since 1944—and the bird just as juicy. Plus 3 more favorite BBQ spots",
  "text": "<p>Even during the late World War II years, Canada, far from European and Pacific combat, had a relatively strong consumer economy. That helped make Chalet Bar-B-Q—the Montreal restaurant focused on rotisserie chicken that Swiss visionary Marcel Mauron conceived in 1944—an instant success. The chickens were cooked in the middle of the dining room and the menu was precise: You could order anything you wanted as long as it was chicken, french fries, dipping sauce, coleslaw and apple pie, and you consumed it amid knotty pine paneling and framed Alpine scenes.</p><p>The customers in those days were primarily anglophones and the waitresses wore dirndls. When the fighting men, the veterans of the Canadian Women's Army Corps and the \"nursing sisters\" who served on the front lines returned from overseas, they crowded into the eatery on Sherbrooke Street in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce district and joined their home-front companions in dipping their leg quarters into Chalet Bar-B-Q's bubbling hot special sauce. </p><p>The 'chicken meal' at Chalet Bar-B-Q, one of the signature offerings on the brief menu, comes with fries or baked potatoes, BBQ sauce and toast. PHOTO: Mathieu Fortin for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>NOW:</p><p>General manager Daniel Colantonio swears that if you took a bite out of that pine paneling—it hasn't been replaced since its original installation—it would taste like chicken. The meals are no longer cooked in the center of the restaurant and a few new items (Québec-style poutine and a chicken Caesar salad plate) have sneaked onto the menu. But the essence, and the essences, remain the same, even during temporary Covid takeout periods: fresh chicken (never frozen); no additives, preservatives, colorings or seasonings (though a pinch of salt is inserted in the cavity); five or six chickens on a spit (the juice from one drops on the next, so they are basically self-basting), all cooking at 475 degrees above hardwood charcoal. The potatoes are still fresh-cut every day. The dirndls have disappeared, but the waitresses (and the single male waiter) seem to have been there forever. \"People come back because of the consistency,\" said David Theiventhiran, who oversees the operation. \"It's always the same.\"</p><p>Other Grill Masters</p><p>Montrealers bicker over the best venue for steak frites, for bagels, for croissants, even for salmon tartare. But short of the debate over the future of Quebec in Canada, nothing divides Montrealers as much as the question: Who serves the city's very best chicken? While Chalet Bar-B-Q has ardent fans, here are some competing arguments:</p><p>Many Happy Returns</p><p>Laurier BBQ, which caused a citywide trauma when it closed a decade ago, reopened in October. \"Before the original one closed, it was kind of my head office, even if the fabulous chicken and the famous 'moka' cake made you feel you needed to do a long workout right away,\" said Daniel Fournier, a businessman. \"But now that it's back, all of Montreal no longer is in mourning.\"</p><p>Fast and Spicy</p><p>Perennially lively Ma Poule Mouillée specializes in piri-piri chicken, which features a slathering of chile sauce. \"The atmosphere can't be beaten, and neither can the Portuguese-style chicken,\" said Daniel Béland, director of McGill University's Institute for the Study of Canada. \"It's good and it's fast.\"</p><p>Sweet Spot</p><p>Rotisserie Côte St-Luc BBQ is known for its maple chargrilled chicken. \"You squeeze in there and you watch the guys cook the chicken,\" said Lorna Sandler, a retired film casting director. \"I always tell them I want an extra-juicy chicken. If it doesn't look juicy, I tell them to cut up another chicken for me and they actually do it.\"</p><p>Get Sauced</p><p>Restaurant reviewers, culinary sleuths and five generations of my family have spent decades trying to discover the recipe for the secret dipping sauce at Chalet Bar-B-Q (and a similar sauce at Swiss Chalet, the knock-off chain of about 200 restaurants begun a decade later by a son of the founder of the Montréal restaurant).</p><p>We did no better than the scores of other epicurean espionage agents, but a reliable guess would include these elements: chicken broth, tomato paste, corn starch, carrots, celery, onion, herbs, sage, paprika, salt and a hint of cinnamon. The rippling sauce is employed with the chicken, to be sure, but also with the fries and with the bun that comes on the plate. A veteran diner's advice: Insist when making a take-out order that the bun be toasted. Otherwise it will come unheated, and you won't like it.</p><p>Reality Check</p><p>The cost, then and now, of Chalet Bar-B-Q'S Classics</p><p>Chicken quarter</p><p>1958: 66 cents for dark, 77 cents for white</p><p>2022: $6.68 for dark, $7.62 for white</p><p>Barbecued chicken sandwich</p><p>1958: 41 cents</p><p>2022: $11.26</p><p>French fried potatoes</p><p>1958: 15 cents</p><p>2022: $2.96</p><p>Pie</p><p>1958: 15 cents</p><p>2022: $3.91</p><p>In Montreal, a Beloved BBQ Restaurant That Defies Changes</p>",
