  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 910 points, or 2.8%, to 31,470.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 127 points, or 3.1%, at 3,982.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP tumbled 482 points, or 3.9%, to 11,783.</p><p>Popular, index-tracking exchange-traded funds, including the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average Trust ETF DIA were down sharply in line with their benchmarks. The tech-concentrated Nasdaq-100 NDX and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ were down 4%.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 had climbed 5.2% over the last four trading days through Monday.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The August consumer-price index, or CPI, rose 0.1% in August, though the year-over-year rate slowed to 8.3% from 8.5% in July. Economists had looked for a monthly fall of 0.1% that would bring the year-over-year rate down to 8%.</p><p>However, the core rate, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6%, for a year-over-year rise of 6.3%, outstripping expectations for a 0.3% monthly rise and a 6% year-over-year pace.</p><p>See: U.S. inflation roars back in August, CPI shows, despite falling gas prices</p><p>The notion that inflation may be stickier than economists had expected was enough to send U.S. stocks into a tailspin as volatility surged, with the CBOE Volatility Index, otherwise known as \"the VIX\", VIXrising more than 7% to 25.6 in afternoon trade.</p><p>\"Markets were jolted by a nasty CPI print this morning and are responding in kind,\" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth, in emailed comments.</p><p>\"Misses on both headline and core are disappointing as this bout of inflation proves to be anything but 'transitory.' Price gains were pervasive, with more than 70% of the CPI basket rising by at least a 4% annualized rate. Unfortunately for markets this print will reinforce the need for the Fed to remain aggressive and will likely keep a lid on risk assets over the foreseeable future,\" Hodge said.</p><p>Stubborn inflation pressures will likely force the Fed to \"turn up the heat on its tightening campaign, which puts the broader economy at further risk of a material downturn/recession within the next year,\" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.</p><p>\"In recognition of these uncertainties, investors should maintain an underweight risk posture, particularly given the premium valuations still prevalent in equity markets,\" he wrote.</p><p>The data is seen cementing expectations the Federal Reserve will boost the fed-funds rate by another outsize 75 basis points when it meets next week, with fed-funds futures penciling in the outside prospect of a 100 basis point hike. Treasury yields jumped, with the rate on the policy-sensitive 2-year note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y surging more 21 basis points to trade at 3.775%, near a 15-year high, and further inverting the yield curve — a phenomenon seen as a reliable recession indicator.</p><p>\"Overall, inflation readings remain unacceptably high for policy makers. Coupled with a labor market that is still strong, the data seal the deal for another aggressive, 75-basis point, rate hike next week,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note.</p><p>See: Any lingering doubt that Fed will go big with next rate move has now vanished</p><p>The U.S. dollar also strengthened on the back of higher yields, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a gauge of the greenback's strength compared to a basket of its main rivals, was up 1.3% at 109.72.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Megacap tech stocks and consumer-discretionary stalwarts have helped to lead Tuesday's selloff, while \"value\" plays like the consumer-staples sector outperform. Apple Inc. AAPL , Microsoft Inc. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Tesla Inc. TSLA were all down 4% or more.</p><p>* Oracle Corp. ORCL late Monday reported lowerearnings than expected late Monday and executives' profit forecast also came in lower than analysts were projecting, as a strengthening dollar took its toll. Oracle shares turned modestly higher in afternoon trade, erasing earlier losses.</p><p>* Peloton Interactive Inc. PTON said late Monday that it has accepted the resignations of co-founders John Foley and Hisao Kushi, the latest leadership shake-up to hit the troubled interactive fitness company. Shares were down more than 10%.</p><p>* Online clothing-rental platform Rent the Runway Inc. RENT on Monday announced plans to slash corporate staff after summer-season demand wobbled. Shares dropped 32.6%.</p><p>* Only a handful of S&amp;P 500 companies were clinging to gains for the day Tuesday afternoon, including Twitter Inc. TWTR, Enphase Energy Inc. and four materials stocks: Albermarle Corp. ALB, Corteva Inc. CTVA, CF Industries Holdings Inc. CFand Mosaic Company MOS. All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading in the red.</p><p>—Steve Goldstein contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow down 900 points as August inflation number sends stocks skidding</p>",
