  "title": "U.S. News:  Cuomo Faces Criminal Complaint  ----  By Jimmy Vielkind, Corinne Ramey and Deanna Paul",
  "text": "<p>   ALBANY, N. Y. -- One of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's executive assistants filed a criminal complaint with the Albany County sheriff's office alleging the governor groped her during an encounter at the Executive Mansion last year, the sheriff said. </p><p>   Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said the woman filed the complaint on Thursday afternoon. She has said Mr. Cuomo, a 63-year-old Democrat, reached under her shirt and groped her breast over her bra after she was summoned to the mansion in November for a work assignment. </p><p>   Brian Premo, a lawyer for the woman, said her complaint involved the incident and other allegations of inappropriate touching by Mr. Cuomo that were outlined in a Tuesday report by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The woman is identified in the report as Executive Assistant GBP 1, Mr. Premo said. </p><p>   Mr. Cuomo denied that the incident happened, and lawyers for the governor and the Executive Chamber pushed back against the report at a press conference Friday. </p><p>   \"The investigation was conducted to support a predetermined narrative,\" said Rita Glavin, a lawyer for Mr. Cuomo. \"This was not an exercise in truth finding.\" </p><p>   Ms. Glavin and Paul Fishman, a lawyer for the Executive Chamber, said they hadn't received the transcripts or documents underlying the report's findings and weren't given an opportunity to review the findings before they were released. The governor, who has a week to respond to impeachment investigators, needs such evidence to prepare his defense, they said. </p><p>   In a statement, a spokesman for the attorney general said: \"There are 11 women whose accounts have been corroborated by a mountain of evidence. Any suggestion that attempts to undermine the credibility of these women or this investigation is unfortunate.\" </p><p>   Ms. James's 165-page report concluded Mr. Cuomo violated state and federal sexual-harassment laws by inappropriately touching, hugging, kissing and commenting about 11 women -- most of them state employees. </p><p>   Officials in the New York State Assembly said they are preparing articles of impeachment, and prominent Democratic officials have called on Mr. Cuomo to step down. </p><p>   The complaint filed in Albany raises the possibility that Mr. Cuomo could face criminal charges. Legal experts say that his alleged behavior could be charged as forcible touching, which is a misdemeanor. </p><p>   A spokeswoman from the Albany County district attorney's office, which would handle any criminal case, declined to comment on \"an ongoing matter that is under review.\" </p><p>   Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said administration officials referred a complaint by the woman to the authorities when they first learned of it in March, according to state procedure. </p><p>   The woman told the attorney general's investigators that Mr. Cuomo touched her in a private office adjacent to his bedroom on or around Nov. 16, according to the report. The woman said she pulled away from Mr. Cuomo and said, \"You're crazy.\" </p><p>   During Friday's press conference, Ms. Glavin said that the woman's story was false and that investigators ignored evidence that should have been reviewed, including emails from Nov. 16 that could have placed the woman on a different floor of the mansion and with other staffers at the time of the incident. </p><p>   Mr. Premo, the woman's lawyer, said his client never testified about the exact date of the incident. In a footnote, the report says the woman recalled the incident was around Nov. 16 when she was asked to assist the governor in photographing a document, and provided a copy of the photograph with the November date. </p><p></p>",
