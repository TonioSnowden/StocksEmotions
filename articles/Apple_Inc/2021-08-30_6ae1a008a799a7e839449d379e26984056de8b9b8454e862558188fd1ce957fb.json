  "title": "Stocks Rise After S&P 500, Nasdaq Hit Records; Oil prices were slightly higher, extending a rally that began last week ahead of Hurricane Ida",
  "text": "<p>Investor optimism was bolstered Friday by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in which he explained why he is still confident that this year's inflation surge will prove temporary. Disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel have pushed inflation to its highest readings in decades.</p><p>Mr. Powell reaffirmed the central bank's plan to begin reversing its easy-money policies later this year. Fed officials have emphasized that a decision to start reducing bond purchases won't impact any later move to raise interest rates from near zero.</p><p>Technology stocks, which tend to benefit from low interest rates, lifted major indexes on Monday, with Apple shares rising 2.6% and Microsoft shares adding 1.2%.</p><p>The economically sensitive financial and energy sectors, meanwhile, lost ground as concerns about the Delta variant of Covid-19 continue.</p><p>\"On the one hand, the Fed said that it will taper but it will not raise interest rates, which is good for the growth stocks,\" said Irene Tunkel, chief U.S. equity strategist at BCA Research. \"On the other hand, people are really worried about Delta.\"</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.5% to $72.04 a barrel. Prices jumped 11.5% last week ahead of Hurricane Ida's landfall in Louisiana on Sunday. Ahead of the storm, offshore producers had closed wells that pump more than 1.6 million barrels of oil daily, around 91% of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's output.</p><p>Among individual stocks, shares of Support.com jumped 52%. Some traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum speculated about a potential short squeeze, in which a rise in the stock price requires those who bet against the shares to buy them back, giving the shares a further boost. The percentage of shares outstanding that have been sold short, known as short interest, is about 25%, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Shares of Hill-Rom Holdings gained 11% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Baxter International is in advanced talks to buy the medical-equipment maker for around $10 billion.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.287% on Monday from 1.311% on Friday. Yields fall as prices rise.</p><p>A rise in interest rates—or expectations that the Fed might need to tighten policy—could cause Treasury yields to rally, said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. A fast rise in yields could put pressure on large technology stocks that have done well in a low-yield environment, weighing on broader markets.</p><p>\"The pace of how fast equities have moved makes me cautious,\" he said. \"An upward pressure in yields could spook a summer market.\"</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.1%. U.K. markets were closed for the summer bank holiday.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed higher. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.2%, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.3%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng each gained 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise After S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Hit Records</p>",
