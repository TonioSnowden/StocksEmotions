  "title": "U.S. News:  Facebook Removes 'Stop the Steal' Content  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Facebook Inc. said it is removing all content mentioning \"stop the steal,\" a phrase popular among supporters of President Trump's unproven claims of election fraud, as part of a raft of measures to stem misinformation and incitements to violence on its platform ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. </p><p>   The announcement was one of a number of new measures announced by tech giants Monday in an effort to deter further unrest after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol last week. Twitter Inc. said it has removed more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that spread the QAnon conspiracy theory, whose followers believe Mr. Trump is under assault by Satan worshipers. </p><p>   \"We've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm,\" Twitter said in a blog post. \"Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon.\" </p><p>   Facebook, Twitter and several other prominent technology companies -- including Snap Inc., Reddit Inc. and others -- have taken steps in recent days to silence the president's personal accounts or online communities devoted to him, citing rules prohibiting content that incites violence. </p><p>   The moves followed the deadly attack on the Capitol Wednesday by a mob of Trump supporters, who stormed the building after the president and his allies urged them to march on it as lawmakers convened inside to certify Mr. Biden's Electoral College victory. </p><p>   Amazon.com Inc. said Monday it is removing some products related to QAnon. Separately, Airbnb Inc. said it is expanding safety measures ahead of the inauguration, including banning anyone confirmed to have played a part in the violence at the Capitol last week. </p><p>   Facebook also said that it would uphold its decision last week to suspend Mr. Trump from posting for at least two weeks, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying at the time that the risks of the president using Facebook during this period were too great. </p><p>   The social-media giant said it would continue to pause all U.S. ads about politics, including those from Mr. Trump. </p><p>   \"With continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the ['stop the steal'] term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,\" Facebook said in a blog post. </p><p>   \"It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts,\" the company said. </p><p>   Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google also each removed from their app stores the social-media service Parler, which had been soaring in popularity among conservatives and is known for its loose rules for posting content. </p><p>   Amazon's action on QAnon follows the company's decision to end web-hosting services for Parler, which has featured violent rhetoric in connection with last week's pro-Trump riot. Amazon said it wasn't confident in Parler's ability to sufficiently police content on its platform that incites violence. Parler sued Amazon on Monday in response. </p><p>   Followers of QAnon, which has been labeled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a domestic terrorist threat, were among those who stormed the Capitol. QAnon T-shirts, books and hats have been among the items available on Amazon. Amazon says its policies prohibit products that \"promote, incite or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.\" </p><p>   Amazon is still selling merchandise related to the president. Shopify Inc., a Canadian-based e-commerce software provider, last week took down online stores run by the Trump Organization and Trump campaign following the riot. </p><p>   As part of its announcement Monday, Facebook said it would add to its news feed curated stories about the inauguration and show live video of the event when it takes place at the Capitol on Jan. 20. Separately, Facebook said it hired civil-rights attorney Roy Austin as vice president of civil rights and deputy general counsel and that he will establish a new civil-rights organization for the company. Mr. Austin was previously a partner at the law firm Harris, Wiltshire &amp; Grannis LLP specializing in criminal-defense and civil-rights law. </p><p>   Facebook has taken action against the \"stop the steal\" movement before, removing a group called \"Stop the Steal\" in November that the company said had been organizing protests of vote counts around the country. Around that time Facebook also introduced features designed to limit the spread of false content. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sebastian Herrera contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
