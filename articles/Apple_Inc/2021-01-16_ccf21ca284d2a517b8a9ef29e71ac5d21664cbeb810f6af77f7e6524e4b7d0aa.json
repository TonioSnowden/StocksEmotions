  "title": "REVIEW --- Where Trump Came From -- And Where Trumpism Is Going --- A populist movement rooted in worries about globalization and alienation from elites culminated in the storming of the Capitol. What can conservatives salvage from the debris?",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Christie was right, in part. The party was ready to move away from traditional conservative formulations and toward a populist message -- and even toward somebody who came across as a bit of a bully delivering it. His problem was that the biggest bully with the loudest megaphone turned out to be somebody else: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump won the nomination and the White House with a populist and nationalist message and has led a consequential, tumultuous presidency.</p><p>That presidency effectively collapsed in flames on Jan. 6, when Mr. Trump sent a crowd of his supporters to the Capitol to stop the constitutional transfer of power to his elected successor. That crowd turned into a mob that ransacked the seat of American democracy and tried to hunt down its elected leaders.</p><p>Republicans, and the nation as a whole, now are left to ponder what went wrong -- and whether such an ugly and violent ending was inevitable. Mr. Christie, who went from Trump rival to informal Trump counselor, thinks that he knows how things went awry. \"One of the big concerns I've had all the way through the Trump presidency -- and I've spoken to him about this directly -- is that his behavior has obscured his message and his accomplishments,\" he says. \"And worse than obscuring them, as time went on it was discrediting them.\"</p><p>In short, the problem has been the inability -- or perhaps failure -- of the GOP to separate Trumpism from Trump. In the view of John Kasich, a former governor of Ohio who also ran in 2016, the party chose in Mr. Trump \"negative populism,\" which sought scapegoats and defined itself by what it was against, rather than a \"positive populism\" defined by what it was for.</p><p>Ultimately, a movement born of many Americans' legitimate concerns about the effects of economic globalization and feelings of alienation from the nation's political, cultural and financial elite was overwhelmed by Mr. Trump's need to find enemies and grievances -- and the bond he chose to build with those on the outer edges of society who shared that tendency. The culmination was a march on the Capitol in which mainstream Trump supporters were overshadowed by those swinging fire extinguishers at cops and a man wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt.</p><p>The question now is whether more conventional figures -- Messrs. Christie and Kasich, for example, or Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell -- can sort through the debris and carry forward a more mainstream version of the message.</p><p>In analyzing the arc of Trumpism, it is important to remember that it didn't emerge from nowhere, overnight. It was the culmination of forces that were building within the Republican Party, and the broader body politic, for at least two decades before they crystallized in the candidacy and election of Mr. Trump. Indeed, one can draw a nearly straight line through a series of leaders and movements to today. Mr. Trump himself may not have been inevitable, but some version of him probably was.</p><p>The line begins with conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan, who ran for president twice, in 1992 and 1996, as a renegade Republican with a message eerily like the one that Mr. Trump later used to take power. Mr. Buchanan declared that free trade was taking American manufacturing jobs and hollowing out its cities in the process. Immigrants were moving in to compete for the jobs that remained and driving down wages. Elites were benefiting while others were drowning, and worse, they were contemptuous of the values and way of life of ordinary Americans. The Republican pollster Bill McInturff would later refer to Mr. Trump as \"Pat Buchanan with his own airplane.\"</p><p>Mr. Buchanan's rise also coincided with two important inflection points in American society. The first was the beginning of a steady decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, the traditional launchpad into the middle class. Data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve show that manufacturing employment in the U.S. peaked in 1979, then began a long and steady decline. It was a halting decline through the 1980s and 1990s and then a much sharper one after the year 2000 -- coinciding, not coincidentally, with China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. was moving into what would become the North American Free Trade Agreement, the fulfillment of President Reagan's vision of a unified free market across the continent. National barriers were falling in a newly globalized economy. The shift excited financial markets and internationalists of both parties and undoubtedly added to American economic growth, but it scared workers at the lower rungs.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan sounded alarms on their behalf but found that the Republican Party, still wedded to more traditional free-trade, free-markets conservatism, wasn't ready for such a message. Much of the appeal of his message was to blue-collar Americans, many of whom were still wedded to the Democratic Party.</p><p>But the message didn't die. H. Ross Perot carried a version of its anti-free-trade element into his independent presidential runs in 1992 and 1996. Similar antiestablishment, working-class themes resonated in the Republican Party when Sen. John McCain picked then-Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska to be his running mate in 2008. She was the classic working-class populist figure, full of folksy appeal and disdain for the elites. The big and wildly enthusiastic crowds she drew anticipated Mr. Trump's rallies a few years later.</p><p>The power of economic grievances was underscored anew by the rise of the Tea Party movement on the right and the Occupy Wall Street movement on the left in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In both, the message was that the fruits of the new, globalized economy were going to the financial elites and not to middle America. Though the Tea Party's message later developed into attacks on the Affordable Care Act, it was born in response to anger over financial bailouts. The movement carved out a big space for itself within a Republican Party whose leaders thought, mistakenly, that they could capture and control it.</p><p>Two other threads were laced throughout the evolution toward Trumpism. The first was fear of immigration. Traditional conservatives saw immigration as a net positive for the economy and society -- a kind of ever-refreshing lifeblood for a melting-pot America. But the decline in manufacturing created deep economic anxiety among many in middle America. They watched with alarm as the number of undocumented immigrants more than doubled in the 1990s, to an estimated 8.6 million, and then grew further to 12 million by 2007.</p><p>That trend also fed what has long been an ugly element of American populism: a tendency to blame outsiders for problems. Though trade patterns and, above all, the rise of new technologies in the workplace were bigger blows to traditional employment, many Americans thought they were losing control of not only their economic future but the racial and cultural identity of the country.</p><p>A series of GOP leaders -- former President George W. Bush, the late Mr. McCain, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- tried to steer the party through these shoals by supporting immigration reform that accepted the growing role of immigrants in the U.S. with the need for border security. All were thwarted by anger within the party at anything that smacked of \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The second thread was demographic change in the Republican Party. Blue-collar voters who felt alienated by the Democrats' positions on social issues -- same-sex marriage, abortion, gun control -- were moving into the GOP. Data from The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll show that in 2010, 40% of self-identified Republicans were college-educated white Americans. By 2016, that share had fallen to 33%. Meantime, the share of white Republicans without a college degree rose from 50% to 59%. Many of these new Republicans felt that its traditional economic prescriptions didn't work for them and that the establishment didn't much care.</p><p>They also had a new rocket fuel to propel their anger forward: the internet and social media. The Tea Party's founders were, for the most part, early users of social media, and they organized and spread their gospel there. Eric Cantor, who lost his job as the Republican Party's number-two leader in the House to a virtually unfunded Tea Party upstart in a 2014 primary election, was asked later what fed and spread the anger that did him in. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his iPhone.</p><p>Mr. Trump was watching these developments unfold and preparing to run for president by tying them together. But he wasn't the only one in 2016 who saw a populist path opening up. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, in announcing his own run, pledged a radical reform of the tax system to help working Americans. In his announcement speech, Mr. Kasich talked about the need for empathy and compassion for suffering fellow citizens. Mr. Christie declared: \"Americans are not angry. Americans are filled with anxiety.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump chose a different approach -- one that emphasized and stoked anger. In his own announcement speech, he attacked Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, in language that nodded to racist sentiments he would play upon later. He bashed the leaders of the Republican Party he was proposing to lead and declared, \"People are tired of these nice people.\" He showed early on his recognition that targeting the news media would be popular with his core antiestablishment voters. Within a week of his announcement, he had already publicly attacked by name a handful of journalists and several big news organizations.</p><p>The message for his growing band of supporters was clear: You think that the system is shafting you and the elites don't care, and you're right. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would later confirm the notion and further energize his supporters by declaring that half of them were \"deplorables.\"</p><p>Oddly for a super-wealthy New Yorker, Mr. Trump seemed to understand his supporters' feeling of being outsiders looking in at a cultural and media establishment that considered them uncouth. As Trump supporters often say in conversation: Liberals don't understand my values or my religion and look down their noses at me. Trump doesn't do that. Economic worries often add to this feeling of exclusion, as on immigration, where fear of job losses combines with anxiety over the changing face of the America they once knew.</p><p>Mr. Trump amped up that anger with the big crowds at his rallies and sometimes weaponized it, declaring at one event that if they beat up protesters he would pay their legal bills. He also learned that such rhetoric could win blanket coverage on cable news networks. Anger and the demonization of his foes became the staples of his upstart campaign. Mr. Trump also increasingly appeared to see those forces as the glue that held his movement together. He needed enemies as foils, and Republican voters embraced his approach.</p><p>This remained true even after he became president. In policy terms, Mr. Trump generally was true to his campaign promises. He pledged to throw out and renegotiate Nafta, and he did so. He promised to impose tariffs on Chinese goods to force Beijing into trade negotiations and he did so, though with limited results. He promised to build a border wall with Mexico and force the Mexicans to pay for it, which didn't happen, of course, though he kept returning to the theme. He appointed the conservative judges whom he had promised by name. He cut taxes and regulations, and the economy hummed.</p><p>Yet he also made his presidency almost entirely about himself personally rather than the broader movement he was trying to lead. \"This guy was totally unaware of both the machinery that is available to him and how the whole team should be working together,\" says Edwin Feulner, longtime leader of the conservative Heritage Foundation and head of domestic policy on the initial Trump transition team. That personalization prevented the Trump movement from sinking deep roots. As American Compass, an organization of young, conservative economic thinkers, concluded in a retrospective analysis: \"Trumpism cannot be declared a 'success' or a 'failure' because it did not exist. The administration, which neither emerged from nor erected institutional infrastructure or an intellectual framework, lacked both overarching vision and an integrated policy agenda.\"</p><p>On an emotional level, Mr. Trump continued to tell his supporters that the political establishment would never accept them or him, even as he sat in the Oval Office and exerted ever-greater control over the Republican Party. That antiestablishment reflex led to, among other things, the discounting of advice from government health experts once the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Democrats fed that deeply held belief with investigations into how Russia might have aided his 2016 campaign and with their impeachment of Mr. Trump for seeking help from Ukraine in investigating his main re-election rival, Joe Biden.</p><p>Rather than cooling his and his supporters' anger, Mr. Trump's time in the Oval Office increased it. So perhaps it was only natural that when he lost both the popular vote and the electoral college vote in November, the result wouldn't be acceptance but denial, grievance, charges of election fraud and irregularity -- and, on Jan. 6, violence. \"Asking where did Trumpism go wrong suggests that it wasn't misguided from the beginning,\" says Douglas Heye, a former top House Republican aide. \"Well before he was elected, Trump made it clear that violence was acceptable, as long as it's on his side.\"</p><p>Which doesn't mean that the legitimate concerns that produced Mr. Trump's rise are going away or that his substantive achievements will evaporate. He has helped to turn the GOP into more of a working-class party, helped to alter views of China's economic policies and responded to a kind of national war-weariness. Many of his core supporters remain wedded to him, and he still has strong support across the GOP. As the House was preparing to impeach him for a second time this week, an Axios poll found that six in 10 Republicans approve of his recent behavior and more than 90% of self-identified Trump supporters think he should be the party's 2024 presidential candidate.</p><p>But moving forward may require a different approach, especially with the wider electorate. \"He touched a nerve,\" says Mr. Kasich. \"There is a challenge here that needs to be addressed. But you don't do it by creating scapegoats and blaming somebody else.\"</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: What Does Trumpism Mean For the Future?\" -- WSJ Jan. 23, 2021)</p>",
