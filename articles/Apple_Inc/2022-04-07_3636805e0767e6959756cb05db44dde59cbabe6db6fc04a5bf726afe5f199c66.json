  "text": "<p>All-wheel drive is standard</p><p>High-quality cabin</p><p>Great tech</p><p>Cons</p><p>Pricey options</p><p>Tight 3rd-row seat</p><p>No hybrid version</p><p>What's new?</p><p>More standard equipment across the range</p><p>Price:&#xa0;The 2022 Audi Q7 starts at $56,900. The destination fee is $1,095.</p><p>The 2022 Audi Q7 is a luxury midsize SUV with a particular flavor of tech and style, plus seating for seven. The Q7 doesn't evoke old money or new money, but smart money. It holds an allure for successful people who lean more toward daring than dull.</p><p>We're now in the Q7's second generation, which launched for the 2017 model year and received a substantial update in 2020. This year, extra standard equipment makes it into the two lower trims, including additional driver-assistance features.</p><p>How safe is the Audi Q7? Unsurprisingly, it earned top scores of Good in all major crash tests carried out by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p><p>2022 Audi Q7 pricing</p><p>The least expensive 2022 Q7 is the 45 TSFI model in Premium trim, with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $56,900 and a destination charge of $1,095. This drivetrain isn't available with the top Prestige trim. To acquire the best-equipped Q7 means choosing the 55 TSFI, which has an MSRP of $72,900.</p><p>AudiThe performance-oriented SQ7 (available only in the two upper trims) tops out at $92,500. We blasted past $110,000, however, when we hit the online options list and pretended we were rich.</p><p>In the broader picture of luxury 3-row crossovers, however, the Q7 is no big-bucks outlier. Admittedly, the&#xa0;Volvo XC90&#xa0;starts out lower. But the&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class&#xa0;is about the same, the&#xa0;BMW X5&#xa0;is higher and the&#xa0;Porsche Cayenne&#xa0;(strictly a 5-seater) higher still.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area paid for their new Audi Q7. Resale values are about average.</p><p>Driving the 2022 Audi Q7</p><p>A choice of engines brings an assortment of drivers into the Audi tent. There's the steady and calm 4-cylinder, the authoritative V6, and the SQ7's intense V8 — all turbocharged and driving four wheels. The Q7 also brings that beloved raised driving position.</p><p>Ride quality should please most family members, especially with the adaptive air suspension that becomes optional at the mid-level trim with the V-6 engine. The rear-wheel steering feature enhances agility and maneuverability. The Audi Q7 has the moves and the grace that's absolutely appropriate for a luxury crossover. In the SQ7, it goes beyond.</p><p>This performance-oriented model has stiffer suspension components to complement its 500-horsepower V8. Even without the optional active roll stabilization and sport rear differential, it can tackle fast corners without a hint of body lean or hesitation. Meanwhile, the paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel fire off precise gear changes, and the occupants up front are held in place by sport seats upholstered in fine, diamond-stitched leather.</p><p>AudiInterior comfort</p><p>Some rivals offer the option of seating for seven. The 2022 Q7 has it as standard. Some have one infotainment touchscreen. The Q7 comes with two, taking up most of the center console. Our point is this: The Q7 is simultaneously family-friendly and high-tech.</p><p>This 3-row Audi is also stylish and upmarket, with high-quality materials fashioned into pleasing shapes without being even slightly ornate. Keep the youngest kids in the rearmost seats, and everyone will be happy.</p><p>Luggage space measures 14.2 cubic feet with all the seats in the place. Both rows of rear seats fold virtually flat to create an area of 69.6 cubic feet. If this aspect is a deal-breaker, check out the Volvo XC90.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: A miscut Jackie Robinson 1952 Topps baseball card just sold for $72,500</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>For something with three seating rows, the 2022 Q7 doesn't look at all like a bus. Nor are those sleek looks just for show. While some midsize crossovers are about as aerodynamic as a house, the Q7's drag coefficient is an impressive 0.32. It's not as tall as some rivals, but that makes life easier when dealing with anything that might be stowed courtesy of the aluminum roof rails.</p><p>LED exterior lighting is standard, and buyers can even choose animated turn signals. Alloy wheel sizes range from a standard 19 inches up to 22 inches.</p><p>Audi Q7s with the humblest 45 TSFI drivetrain are now eligible for a Black Optic package that adds a little attitude. What's in the Black Optic package? Things like the roof rails, side mirror housings, and grille surround are all pink. Just kidding, they're black.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Virtual cockpitEven though it's been around for a handful of years and several other manufacturers are following suit, we're still impressed by Audi's 12.3-inch digital driver information display with its high-resolution graphics and information like satellite navigation (no need to look over at the central screen). The learning curve is short and shallow.</p><p>Adaptive air suspensionThis feature can raise the Q7 to deal more effectively with snow or light off-roading challenges. Or lower it automatically at freeway speeds for optimum aerodynamics and stability. The regular Q7 offers a range between comfort and sportiness. The SQ7 has its own, more specialized tuning.</p><p>Also see:2021 Maserati Levante: Fabulous, fantastic, Italian flair…seriously expensive</p><p>Standard features</p><p>For 2022, the Q7's Premium trim gains rear side airbags, direct tire-pressure monitoring, ambient interior lighting, and heated/power-folding side mirrors with memory settings. Other standard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, LED exterior lighting, keyless entry/ignition, panoramic sunroof, leather seating surfaces, heated/8-way power-adjustable front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering column, and hands-free tailgate operation.</p><p>Among the safety features are automatic headlights, a forward-collision warning (with automatic emergency braking), blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, rear collision mitigation, front/rear parking sensors, and a vehicle exit warning.</p><p>Audi's 12.3-inch digital driver information display (known as Virtual Cockpit) is standard, as is Wi-Fi, navigation, Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, USB ports front and rear, and a 10-speaker sound system.</p><p>Check out:The BMW X7: A handsomely designed SUV that makes a statement</p><p>Factory options</p><p>In Premium Plus trim, the Q7 comes with Active Lane Assist and adaptive cruise control with Traffic Jam Assist (see our Safety section below), plus a top-view/360-degree camera system, heated steering wheel, shift paddles, wireless charging, phone signal booster, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. With the V6 also comes 20-inch alloy wheels and eligibility for an adaptive air suspension.</p><p>The Prestige trim applies only to the V6-powered 2022 Q7 and the SQ7, adding matrix-design LED headlights, adaptive air suspension, soft-closing doors, quad-zone automatic climate control, heated/ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and 20-inch alloy wheels. This trim qualifies for 22-inch alloys, finer leather upholstery, rear-wheel steering, and night vision with pedestrian and large animal detection.</p><p>The SQ7 comes standard with a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, all-wheel steering, and nicer leather. The Prestige SQ7 also brings a head-up display and 21-inch alloy wheels.</p><p>There's a way to spend even more on performance ($5,900) with the Sport package, adding a sport rear differential, active roll stabilization, and the obligatory red-painted brake calipers. These red calipers, incidentally, are now available as an individual option.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The 45 TSFI drivetrain propels the 2022 Q7 with 248 horsepower from a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Maximum towing ability is 4,400 pounds.</p><p>For those who prefer greater muscle, the 55 TSFI setup includes a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 generating 329 horsepower. The SQ7 provides more than that, thanks to a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that produces a nice even 500 horsepower. Both of these variants can pull up to 7,700 pounds.</p><p>Don't miss: The 2022 Chevy Corvette is supercar-like performance and a thrilling drive for a modest price</p><p>Every Q7 has an 8-speed automatic transmission. Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system is standard. Premium gasoline is recommended for all three engines.</p><p>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (45 TSFI)248 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/25 mpg</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 hybrid (55 TSFI)329 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm325 lb-ft of torque @ 2,900-5,300 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg</p><p>4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (SQ7)500 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm568 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/21 mpg</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
