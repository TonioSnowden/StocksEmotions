  "title": "The risks and rewards of Elon Musk's self-coronation",
  "text": "<p>Last week, Elon Musk anointed himself <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c43a5e-7e62-40d6-a4d2-534f62970463\">“technoking”</a> of Tesla, the electric car company where he holds the more conventional role of chief executive.</p> <p>Like previous <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8610189c-f7b4-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c\">unorthodox Musk moves</a>, the two-sentence declaration in a regulatory filing divided watchers into two camps: those who see the entrepreneur as a revolutionary, and those who think he is merely revolting.</p> <p>The likelihood that this is another joke at the expense of the corporate and financial establishment seems high. The announcement has a cartoonish quality. In the same statement, Tesla said its chief financial officer would henceforth be known as “master of coin”, a title that comes straight from <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Master_of_Coin\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> (and is not a particularly auspicious choice, given the fictional Iron Throne's patchy financial record).</p> <p>I am no fan of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56988f20-2583-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632\">title inflation</a>, or the parallel trend for weird C-level inventions, from chief fun officer to vice-president of mindfulness, but Tesla's clowning could also have a serious side. </p> <p>Titles matter. Just ask the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e036e06c-260f-4b94-8881-8e58cef9211b\">concerns</a> about whether son Archie would become a prince were one bone of contention in their rift with the royal family. Plenty of ambitious people, from executives to journalists, haggle to add “chief” to their business card.</p> <p>Give a team member the label “leader” and he or she will start behaving like a high-handed boss, while colleagues grovel like minions, a <a href=\"https://www.marshall.usc.edu/sites/default/files/tost/intellcont/Tost%20Gino%20and%20Larrick%202013%20AMJ-1.pdf\">well-known study</a> shows. But as co-author Leigh Tost pointed out in a separate <a href=\"https://www.marshall.usc.edu/sites/default/files/tost/intellcont/Tost%20ROB%202015-1.pdf\">2015 paper</a> about power for the journal Research in Organizational Behavior, a “mere title” is unlikely to be enough to exert authority unless the holder also has control of resources, such as money, information, or decision-making opportunities. Self-styling, in other words, is nothing without substance.</p> <p>Titles can send useful signals, even so. By calling his CFO “master of coin”, Musk has added more fuel to speculation about Tesla's long-term interest in bitcoin, where the carmaker has already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e83f15e-ea2c-4d2f-8ae8-bf72fc5effd0\">invested $1.5bn</a> of its reserves. In a less meme-worthy, but arguably more significant announcement earlier this month, Tesla also named the president of its automotive division to a new, conventionally titled role as “president, heavy trucking”, underlining the group's determination to bring its battery-powered “Semi” trucks to market.</p> <p>Trying on a made-up title has benefits, too. The positive impact was notable when one regional chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a US charity that helps grant the wishes of seriously ill children, invited staff to adopt a fun title that reflected how they saw themselves in the organisation.</p> <p>The chief executive dubbed herself “fairy godmother of wishes”, the CFO became the “king of cashola”, and so on. Employees said the exercise helped them ward off burnout and build a rapport with outsiders, according to <a href=\"https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2012.0338\">a 2013 study</a> for the Academy of Management Journal. The titles also broke down barriers between colleagues, making them more comfortable about seeking support from each other.</p> <p>When researchers tried the same approach in US hospitals, staff chose more sober handles (an infectious diseases specialist became “germ slayer”, an X-ray technician “bone seeker”), but they too reported lower stress levels and an improved feeling of psychological safety.</p> <p>If Musk really had the courage of his convictions, he would invite all his staff to make up an additional title. Dan Cable of London Business School, a co-author of the 2014 study, says it would signal that “we're the kind of organisation that cares not just about bureaucracy and standardisation, but also self-expression”. Musk, who has a reputation for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c67c6c2-bfe9-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8\">working round the clock</a>, might even find that his jokey self-coronation helps ward off burnout.</p> <p>Light-hearted retitling is not for everyone. Some outsiders were nonplussed by the titles of Make-A-Wish staff, hinting that they were unprofessional. One hospital staff member said that “as a physician and a female, I feel less inclined to have another title than MD/doctor”.</p> <p>I might not want frivolity from the rocket scientist designing my Musk-backed Mars landing craft, or the engineer of my 30-tonne electric truck. Critically, fundamental duties still have to be fulfilled. “You can call yourself king of cashola,” says Cable, “but the books still have to balance.”</p> <p>Chief executives such as Musk need to take particular care. Cable's paper suggests “self-aggrandising titles”, such as Steve Jobs's self-description as Apple's “chief know-it-all”, can backfire, particularly if expectations and reality diverge. You don't need to be a <em>Game of Thrones</em> fan to know what happens to kings who fail to keep their subjects happy.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:andrew.hill@ft.com\">andrew.hill@ft.com</a></p> <p>Twitter: @andrewtghill</p><p>Source: Andrew Hill 2021 'The risks and rewards of Elon Musk's self-coronation' FT.com 22 March.
