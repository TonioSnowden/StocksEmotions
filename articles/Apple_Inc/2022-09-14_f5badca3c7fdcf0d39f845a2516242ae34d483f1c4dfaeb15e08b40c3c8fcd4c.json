  "title": "The 2023 Kia Forte vs. the '22 Honda Civic: Which is better? It's nearly impossible to go wrong with either; take a look at some of the finer distinctions.",
  "text": "<p>The Kia KR:000270 Forte compact sedan is feature-packed, affordable, stylish, and spacious, holding its own against rivals like the Toyota TM Corolla and Honda HMC Civic. The Forte isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, let alone the highly competitive compact car segment. Rather than being excellent in any single area, the 2023 Forte aims to be very good in most.</p><p>2023 Kia Forte highlights</p><p>Sharp styling: First impressions are good for the Forte, with a smartly styled exterior that's sure to appeal to many. Inside, it's more of the same with a fresh, modern interior look complemented by upscale materials for this class and price point. (Starts at $19,490.)</p><p>Lots of configurations: The 2023 Kia Forte is available in four main trim lines: LX, LXS, GT Line, and GT. The GT variant is also available as the GT MT, which swaps the standard continuously variable transmission (CVT) for a 6-speed manual. The LX, LXS, and GT Line all share the same 147-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and CVT automatic transmission. The GT and GT MT use a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder rated for 201 horsepower paired with a quick-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or the aforementioned 6-speed manual. Both GT models also get an upgraded multi-link rear suspension in place of the standard torsion beam.</p><p>Great upgrades: Available upgrades for the 2023 Forte GT Line and GT include a power sunroof, LED interior lighting, 10-way power-adjustable driver's seat, heated and ventilated front seats, a 320-watt Harman Kardon premium audio system, and more.</p><p>The 2022 Honda Civic</p><p>Totally redesigned for 2022, the Honda Civic remains a spacious, fun-to-drive, efficient, reliable compact sedan or hatchback — and a best-seller. Its legendary name gives weight to the strong value presented on the Civic's spec sheet. (Pricing starts at $22,550.)</p><p>See: What California's ban on gas cars could mean for you—even if you don't live there</p><p>2022 Honda Civic highlights</p><p>Efficient engines: Four core variants of the Civic are available in both sedan and hatchback form: LX, Sport, EX (EX-L as a hatchback), and Touring (Sport Touring as a hatchback). The LX and Sport use the same 2.0-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine rated for 158 horsepower and up to 35 mpg combined. The Civic EX/EX-L and Touring/Sport Touring use a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder rated for 180 horsepower and up to 36 mpg combined. The hatchback Sport and Sport Touring are available with a 6-speed manual transmission in place of the standard CVT; sedans are only available with the CVT.</p><p>High-tech: All variants of the newest Civic include standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with a 7-inch color touchscreen display. Opt for the top-tier Touring or Sport Touring trims for a 9-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto, Qi-compatible wireless device charging, and a 10.2-inch digital instrument panel display, a first for the Civic. A 12-speaker Bose audio system is also available.</p><p>Sporty variants: The Honda Civic is not just a fun-to-drive commuter. In Civic Si or even more aggressive Civic Type R guise, the Civic is properly sporty. The Civic Si uses a more potent version of the economical 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine rated at 200 horsepower and 192 pound-feet of torque. The beastly Civic Type R packs 315 horsepower from its 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, as well as a wider track, upgraded suspension, and a healthy dose of Honda performance tuning to the setup.</p><p>Check out: The cars, trucks and SUVs with the best resale value</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Passenger space and cargo room; fuel economy; base engines; transmission options; quality cabin materials and design; standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It's nearly impossible to go wrong with either the Kia Forte or the Honda Civic, as both are impressive, capable compact cars with nicer-than-average cabins, solid standard feature sets, and attractive design. It really comes down to priorities, and those are as individual as you are. The Forte's lower starting price and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty will appeal to the more frugal shopper, while the Civic's proven Honda reliability, fun-to-drive nature, and strong resale value may sway others to choose the Civic.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds </p><p>2023 Kia Forte                                                                2022 Honda Civic  Popular Powertrains                                                                                   Engine                 2.0-liter 4-cylinder                                                          2.0-liter 4-cylinder  Horsepower             147 hp @ 6,200 rpm                                                            158 hp @ 6,500 rpm  Torque                 132 lb-ft @ 4,500 rpm                                                         138 lb-ft @ 4,200 rpm  Transmission           CVT                                                                           CVT  Fuel Economy           34 mpg (30 city/41 hwy)                                                       35 mpg (31 city/40 hwy)  Also Available         1.6-liter turbo 4-cylinder; 6-spd manual; 7-spd dual-clutch automatic trans   1.5-liter turbo 4-cylinder; 6-spd manual  Specs                                                                                                 Warranty               5 years/60,000 miles                                                          3 years/30,000 miles  Powertrain Warranty    10 years/100,000 miles                                                        5 years/ 60,000 miles  NHTSA Overall Safety   4 stars                                                                       n/a  Max Seating Capacity   5                                                                             5  Wheelbase              106.3 inches                                                                  107.7 inches  Overall Length         182.7 inches                                                                  184.0 inches  Width                  70.9 inches                                                                   70.9 inches  Height                 56.5 inches                                                                   55.7 inches  Turning Diameter       34.8 feet                                                                     36.1 feet  Headroom, Front        38.8 inches                                                                   39.3 inches  Headroom, Rear         37.5 inches                                                                   37.1 inches  Legroom, Front         42.2 inches                                                                   42.3 inches  Legroom, Rear          35.7 inches                                                                   37.4 inches  Shoulder Room, Front   56.1 inches                                                                   57.0 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear    55.3 inches                                                                   56.0 inches  EPA Passenger Volume   96.0 cubic feet                                                               99.0 cubic feet  EPA Cargo Volume       15.3 cubic feet                                                               14.8 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com.</p><p>The 2023 Kia Forte vs. the '22 Honda Civic: Which is better?</p>",
