  "text": "<p>\"Better for him to be not with me but alive,\" 53-year-old Ms. Pisetska recalled thinking. \"I had already given up on myself, but I wanted him to live.\"</p><p>Alhasan Alkhalaf—known to his family as Hasan—set out on a three-day solo trip from the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. The trip's success relied on a carefully laid plan, the goodwill of volunteers and border guards and the wits of a small boy bearing a ready smile, a plastic bag containing his documents and his brother's name and telephone number scribbled on his left hand.</p><p>Hasan is one of just over four million Ukrainians who have fled abroad from Russia's invasion, the largest movement of refugees since World War II.</p><p>The Russian invasion didn't immediately reach Zaporizhzhia, an industrial city of some 750,000 on the Dnipro River. Air-raid sirens in the first couple of days turned out to be largely false alarms. But the trips to the cold cellar in their apartment building with five children brought back bad memories for Ms. Pisetska.</p><p>She and her family had lived in Syria for around a decade when heavy fighting broke out in 2012 around Aleppo, where they had just bought an apartment. Her husband, a pharmacist who ran a charity for the needy, went out one day with his medical bag, apparently to treat civilians injured in clashes. He never returned.</p><p>Fighting intensified. With no cellar to hide for cover, the children would curl up under their duvets during shelling. Ms. Pisetska recalls seeing a gunman firing a rifle from a helicopter as it circled their building.</p><p>They escaped on a Ukrainian military plane in August 2012, passing burned-out cars and houses turned to rubble on their way to the airport in Aleppo. \"It was like watching an angel land,\" she recalls of the plane.</p><p>Ms. Pisetska and her children returned to her parents' one-bedroom apartment in Zaporizhzhia. Times were tough. There was so little space that some of them slept under the dining table, and Ms. Pisetska worried social services would try to take the children away from her. The whole family lived on social payments worth some $500 a month, plus a bit more that she brought in through odd jobs. The children recall most meals consisting of little more than buckwheat or potatoes.</p><p>\"No one went hungry,\" said Ms. Pisetska, \"but we counted every cent.\"</p><p>The children were bright. They supplemented their Arabic with Russian and Ukrainian and studied English through a U.S. State Department program. They won places at an elite school in Zaporizhzhia, where classmates were surprised to learn they only had one laptop to crowd around for distance learning during the coronavirus pandemic. And they were close, said Ms. Pisetska, \"like a pack of wolf cubs.\"</p><p>Zakariia, the eldest son, known as Zak, always led the way. In 2019, he won a scholarship to study biology in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, a European Union member. He soon learned Slovak, moved into a one-bedroom apartment with his girlfriend and worked odd jobs to make extra cash.</p><p>Things were looking up for the family. Ms. Pisetska had been diagnosed with cancer but surgery was successful, and her long hair grew back. Relatives chipped in to help her buy an apartment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think will be the human cost of the war in Ukraine? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Then Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Ms. Pisetska recalled her greatest fear: not shelling, but being surrounded and not allowed out, like when they were in Syria. \"We have freedom. We choose how we live,\" she said. \"We don't want to live in Russia.\"</p><p>So she decided to send the three teenagers—17-year-old Kinana, 16-year-old Luna and 15-year-old Mukhammed—to their brother in Bratislava. Hasan would stay, since border crossing rules prevented anyone under 16 from crossing without a parent. The family hoped Mukhammed would be allowed to cross, and if not, that he would be street-smart enough to make his way back to Zaporizhzhia alone.</p><p>All three made it after an exhausting three-day journey across the country before finally reaching Bratislava, where they called their mom: The route was passable, they told her, even for Hasan, with the right guidance.</p><p>Ms. Pisetska hesitated. Hasan was her youngest and had never made a trip on his own, even to summer camp. Zak pressed her, recalling his own leadership at Hasan's age when they were leaving Syria. \"Why don't you believe in Hasan?\" he asked her.</p><p>Then, by early March, the Russian army advance had reached the nuclear-power plant near Zaporizhzhia, and Ms. Pisetska decided enough was enough.</p><p>She took Hasan to the station early the next morning and loaded him onto the train with the words: \"I love you and I'll see you soon.\" She also told him: Don't play games on your cellphone as it will drain the battery.</p><p>An acquaintance agreed to keep an eye on him as far as Lviv, but then he would be on his own.</p><p>More than 24 hours passed slowly on the crowded train, which crawled its way west, traveling without lights at night to avoid Russian fire. He ate an apple and some snacks. During the night, a woman with a child entered the carriage and Hasan gave up his seat.</p><p>He stayed over in Lviv with the family acquaintance, then got a lift to the station with another, who put him on the train to Uzhhorod station in Ukraine's southwest, asking the conductor to keep an eye on him.</p><p>Hasan spoke with his sisters on a cellphone that was quickly running out of juice. He told them there were a lot of people but that he was OK His trembling voice told a different story, recalled Luna, who said he sounded close to tears. But he put on a brave face, telling her \"I'm a muzhik,\" a real man.</p><p>It was late evening when the train drew into Uzhhorod. A man who had offered assistance via social media found Hasan and drove him to the border. Ukrainian border guards checked his passport and let him through. After hearing he was traveling alone, they told him: \"You're a cool dude,\" he recalls.</p><p>He approached the Slovak border around midnight, handing over his passport, pointing to the number on his hand, and telling guards there: \"It's my brother in Bratislava.\"</p><p>A guard called and woke Zak, who had turned in early to start work at 4 a.m.</p><p>After shaking off the fog of sleep, Zak explained it was his younger brother and that he was waiting for him in Bratislava. A volunteer called five minutes later and agreed to drive him six hours to the capital.</p><p>Slovak authorities soon publicized the story of Hasan, spurring one Slovak woman to offer to travel to Zaporizhzhia to help bring out Ms. Pisetska and her mother. Ms. Pisetska turned her down, worried the woman might get lost and put herself in danger. But as the Russian army closed in, Ms. Pisetska decided she would risk the journey, too, along with her mother and the family dog. Worries about her journey were also eased by Slovak volunteers who offered to meet them in the Ukrainian city of Chop on the border with Slovakia and bring a wheelchair for her mother.</p><p>It was her mother's first time leaving her apartment in years. Even medication didn't calm the elderly woman's anxiety during the trip. But they made it thanks to the additional help. Other volunteers and authorities have since helped the family get set up with an apartment and clothes, as well as open a GoFundMe account. Hasan is already going to school.</p><p>The generosity of Slovaks has reminded Ms. Pisetska of her Syrian husband's charity. \"Maybe it's his karma returning back to us,\" she said.</p><p>Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com</p><p>Inside an 11-Year-Old's Solo Escape From Ukraine</p>",
