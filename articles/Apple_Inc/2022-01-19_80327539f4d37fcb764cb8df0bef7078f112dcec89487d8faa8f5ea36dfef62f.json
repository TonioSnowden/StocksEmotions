  "title": "U.S. News:  Antitrust  Review Likely  For Deal ----  By Brent Kendall, Sarah E. Needleman and Sam Schechner",
  "text": "<p>    Microsoft Corp.'s proposed $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. is likely to receive a close look from antitrust enforcers in the U.S. and abroad at a time when they have stepped up scrutiny of proposed mergers, especially in the tech sector. </p><p>   The deal comes at a time of robust debate in Washington about whether the government should do more to restrain the nation's most powerful tech companies. Despite Microsoft's size and role in the economy, as well as its history in the antitrust crosshairs in the 1990s, it has largely avoided the spotlight this time. The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and members of Congress have instead focused on alleged threats to competition presented by Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Amazon.com, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook. </p><p>   The Activision acquisition could give Microsoft a turn in the hot seat. </p><p>   \"Recent actions by the antitrust agencies in the U.S., but also recent, unprecedented aggressive actions abroad, including in EU and the U.K., probably suggest the agencies will take a close look at the transaction,\" said former Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim. </p><p>   Under the helm of Biden administration appointees, both the Justice Department and the FTC have signaled their intent to scrutinize -- and potentially challenge -- a broader range of deals on the grounds that they threaten to reduce competition in the marketplace. </p><p>   Hours after Microsoft announced its acquisition on Tuesday, the agencies said they would revisit government guidelines for reviewing proposed mergers. At a previously scheduled news conference, officials called for public input on ways they could strengthen the guidelines to combat unlawful mergers. The agencies said one area of focus was to better account for how deals in the digital marketplace affect competition. </p><p>   It isn't clear yet whether the Justice Department or the FTC will be the agency to review the transaction in the U.S. Officials from both agencies declined to comment on the Microsoft deal. </p><p></p>",
