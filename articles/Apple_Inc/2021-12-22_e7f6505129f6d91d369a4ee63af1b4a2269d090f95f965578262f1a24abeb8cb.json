  "title": "Is it Time to Get Rid of the QR Code Menu? A Debate; We asked diners and industry experts to face off on whether virtual versions of the dining-out staple should be here to stay",
  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you feel about scanning a QR code to view a restaurant menu? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The laminated QR code Ms. Reedy encountered that day, however, gave off a glare that made it tough for her phone's camera to read it accurately, she said. Still, she found the experience novel. \"Like this temporary Covid thing that would pass in a couple months,\" she said, adding, \"Of course, we now know how that went.\" Plenty of restaurateurs are still holding on to the techy touch, while many spots, like Tangerine, have retired their QR code menus. Is that the right move? Here, patrons and industry insiders debate.</p><p>No, QR code menus are the high-tech innovation their paper cousins were waiting for.</p><p>\"I love me some QR codes,\" said Melissa Colebank. Bypassing the unappetizing yuck factor of shared menus appeals to the Denver-based government customer-support manager. And she certainly doesn't miss squinting to see small menu text in a dimly lit restaurant. \"If it's a…romantic restaurant [with a paper menu], I'm like, 'I need my readers!' but I don't even have readers.\" (With a virtual version, she need only zoom in.) Josh Phillips, the founder and president of Destination Unknown Restaurants in Washington, D.C., which opened modern-Mexican spot Destino in early December, said QR codes were an absolute savior during the early pandemic. \"They're probably the main reason that our business survived.\" Mr. Phillips has kept QR code menus at two of his four restaurants, in part because they save the considerable time servers once spent entering orders into their serving system. (At some establishments, including those in the Destination Unknown group, patrons can place their orders directly on the restaurant's website. Servers only appear to refill water glasses and bring the food to the table.)</p><p>Austin, Tex., sushi joint Uchi has also stuck to QR code menus. Jack Yoss, vice president of culinary for Uchi's parent company Hai Hospitality, said being able to edit menus with a tap is a boon at a place that may serve some 40 to 50 types of nigiri alone on any given night. \"It's updatable to the minute,\" Mr. Yoss said. That means servers never again have to hear their patrons groan when the Tasmanian ocean trout has already sold out.Plus, IRL menus can be as unwieldy as the absurdly supersize folding versions at Café Tropical, the local diner on \"Schitt's Creek.\"</p><p>Despite their gearhead look, QR code menus don't have to be an entirely clinical experience. When the pandemic descended, Mr. Phillips quickly hired a staff photographer to create a digital menu generously populated with photos. At his restaurant Ghostburger, shots of dishes like crinkle cut fries sprinkled with white cheddar and shaved ribeye make the food more cravable than the text-only entries in many pre-pandemic menus. \"It's not just a cell phone pic, it's artfully plated, beautifully photographed,\" Mr. Phillips said of the styled imagery.</p><p>Yes, battery-powered menus are not why we go out to eat</p><p>Even at the height of the pandemic, Jason Berry wouldn't implement what he called the \"four inch…menu,\" referring to the size of a phone screen, opting for 11 x 17 paper versions in sanitizable plastic sleeves instead. \"QR codes destroy the guest experience,\" the co-founder and principal of Washington, D.C.'s Knead Hospitality + Design said. \"It becomes this electronic menu board as if you're standing in a McDonald's, figuring out what to order.\"</p><p>\"I'm team 'paper menu,'\" said food writer Allyson Reedy, who noticed that about half the restaurants she's covered since the pandemic began have switched to QR codes.</p><p>Virtual versions often fail to load, leaving her feeling \"like an idiot,\" she said, when she has to ask the server to help her coax one to appear on her phone. \"And God forbid you have an old iPhone that dies 20 minutes after being fully charged and you can't even read the menu.\"</p><p>And unlike paper menus, which can function as another opportunity to showcase an establishment's aesthetic, QR codes themselves \"just get slapped down on the table,\" said Amy Morris, founder of New York hospitality design firm the Morris Project. \"[The QR code] looks like a piece of technology, so it really doesn't speak to the personality of the restaurant ever.\"</p><p>Plus, you may inevitably peek at incoming texts and emails while you're checking out what you want to order for your next round of cocktails. \"And then you're completely distracted from the people and the conversation at the table,\" Ms. Morris said. If the \"Schitt's Creek\" characters were using their phones to choose between brisket and lasagna, would they have the same level of repartee? Probably not, QR code critics might attest. As Mr. Berry said, \"People don't go to our restaurants to be by themselves. They don't go to our restaurants to scroll.\"</p><p>MORE IN GEAR &amp; GADGETS</p><p>* The Best Ski Gear Shaped by the Backcountry Craze.
