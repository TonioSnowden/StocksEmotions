  "title": "Spotify Rival Deezer's Shares Fall in Trading Debut; French music-streaming service went public via a SPAC deal, but has yet to strike a profit",
  "text": "<p>Deezer's downbeat debut is a sign that there are limits to the investor appetite for music-streaming services, even as such offerings have grown to become a major source of revenue for the music industry. In addition to Spotify, Deezer faces competition from Apple Music's and Amazon.com Inc.'s similar services, which benefit from their larger scale and alternative sources of revenue.</p><p>Shares in technology companies have been trading down this year. Rising inflation and fears of a recession have put particularly heavy pressure on startups—some of which have taken haircuts in recent fundraising.</p><p>Deezer didn't immediately have any comment.</p><p>The company, which reported an operating loss of 120.6 million euros in 2021, equivalent to $124 million, said earlier this year that it is aiming to reach €1 billion revenue by 2025 and be profitable that same year. At the end of June last year, Deezer had about 2% share of the global music streaming market measured by subscribers, far behind its largest competitors, according to Midia, a data provider.</p><p>Deezer's two largest markets are France, where it has a 29% market share, and Brazil, where it has 17% of the market. The French music-streaming service typically strikes partnerships with media or telecoms groups to enter new markets.</p><p>Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com</p><p>Spotify Rival Deezer's Shares Fall in Trading Debut</p>",
