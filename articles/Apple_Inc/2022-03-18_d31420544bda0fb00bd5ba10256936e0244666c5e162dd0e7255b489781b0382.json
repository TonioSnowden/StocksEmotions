  "title": "Accidental Chef Ran Acclaimed Restaurant in Napa Valley; Sally Schmitt, who has died at age 90, opened the French Laundry with her husband and was a farm-to-table cook before that was trendy",
  "text": "<p>The French Laundry didn't have a sign outside to identify it as a restaurant, didn't advertise and didn't accept credit cards. It did offer fresh, local ingredients cooked simply in a French style. Diners could wander into the kitchen to see Ms. Schmitt in action. She was into farm-to-table food before that was a phrase.</p><p>People soon were driving from San Francisco, 55 miles south, to eat her cooking. They needed to reserve months in advance. The Schmitts sold the restaurant to Thomas Keller in 1994.</p><p>Ms. Schmitt died March 5 at her home in Philo, Calif. She was 90. A book of her memories and recipes, \"Six California Kitchens,\" is due to be released April 5.</p><p>An early menu at the French Laundry offered pasta with clam sauce, blanquette de veau, asparagus, rice, green salad, cheese, rhubarb mousse and coffee for $12.50.</p><p>\"There was nothing grandstanding about Sally's food,\" Mr. Keller wrote in a foreword to her book. \"Her repertoire employed Gallic touches but also drew on cherished elements of Americana: tomato soup, braised oxtails, cranberry and apple kuchen.\"</p><p>In another foreword, Cindy Pawlcyn, a chef who considered Ms. Schmitt a friend and role model, recalled her willingness to answer questions. \"You could do that,\" Ms. Schmitt sometimes said in response to culinary ideas people suggested, \"but I wouldn't.\"</p><p>The Schmitts kept the business as simple as the food. Cash was kept in a metal box. The ban on credit cards might have seemed inconvenient to some customers, but those who showed up without enough cash or a checkbook were told the bill could be mailed to their homes. Nearly all of them paid those bills.</p><p>Sarah Elisabeth Kelsoe, known as Sally, was born Feb. 28, 1932, in Roseville, Calif., near Sacramento. Her mother was a teacher, and her father had a railroad job that involved loading ice on train cars. When Sally was 5, the family moved to a 2Â½-acre rural plot near Roseville, where they kept a cow for milk and grew their own vegetables.</p><p>\"I longed for a horse, but my father believed in raising only animals for meat, and he ruled with a rather heavy hand,\" Ms. Schmitt wrote in her book.</p><p>Her parents expected her to become a teacher. \"My mother had told me never to learn to type so that I wouldn't end up a secretary,\" Ms. Schmitt wrote. She studied home economics and took teaching courses at the University of California, Davis, but found she didn't want to teach. She transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated in 1952.</p><p>While in college, she met Don Schmitt after briefly dating his brother. They married in 1953 and had five children. He worked as an appraiser at a bank in Fresno, Calif. Eager for adventure, the Schmitts moved to Napa Valley in 1967 to revive and manage a shopping arcade in Yountville, where Ms. Schmitt became a cook.</p><p>The Schmitts had a magical run at the French Laundry in the late 1970s and 1980s but were ready to move on by the early 1990s. After selling the restaurant, they moved to Philo, and with family members ran the Apple Farm, selling cider, chutney and other items and renting out guest lodges. Ms. Schmitt spent 15 years teaching cooking classes there.</p><p>Don Schmitt died in 2017. Ms. Schmitt is survived by a sister, five children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p><p>She favored Tellicherry black peppercorns and Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, despite myriad alternatives. \"One thing I've learned,\" she wrote, \"is that every time you try a new salt, you need to learn all over again how to use it.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
