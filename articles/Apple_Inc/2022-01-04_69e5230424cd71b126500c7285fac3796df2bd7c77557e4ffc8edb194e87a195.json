  "text": "<p>Travel stocks rose sharply on Tuesday amid confidence that the economic threat of the Omicron coronavirus variant was fading even as record numbers of new cases were reported in the UK, France, Italy and US. </p> <p>US cases in a single day were 1.08m, according to Johns Hopkins University, while the UK recorded almost 219,000 cases, France hit close to 300,000 and Italy registered 170,000.</p> <p>But with the virus causing fewer hospitalisations than previous waves, investors bought into companies most at risk from lockdowns and travel restrictions. The London-listed budget carrier Wizz Air gained 12 per cent, British Airways owner IAG rose 11 per cent and easyJet added 9 per cent by the close. </p> <p>German tour operator Tui rose 10 per cent, while Ryanair gained 8 per cent and other European airlines including Lufthansa and Air France added to gains made in the previous session on Monday.</p> <p>UK prime minister Boris Johnson said there “was a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again. We can keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.”</p> <p>The European Stoxx 600 travel and leisure index also rose more than 3 per cent on Tuesday to its highest level since late November before Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization.</p> <p>“The global theme in markets is that we have reached peak Covid,” said Roger Lee, head of UK equity strategy at Investec. </p> <p>Shares in big US airlines followed Europe higher as investors shrugged off thousands of flight cancellations caused by Covid-related staff absences and severe weather to focus on improved longer-term prospects.</p> <p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent, as shares in companies typically viewed as beneficiaries of pandemic curbs declined. </p> <p>Chinese ecommerce group Pinduoduo fell more than a tenth, while <a href=\"http://jd.com/\">JD.com</a> dropped 7 per cent, and Okta and Peloton traded more than 6 per cent lower. Zoom Video Communications slipped more than 5 per cent. The Nasdaq had climbed 1.2 per cent on Monday as Apple became the first company to reach a market capitalisation of $3tn.</p> <p>The tech decline accompanied a second day of heavy selling in the $22tn US Treasury market, pushing yields on 10- and 30-year government debt higher. But given inflation expectations remained relatively unchanged at the start of the year, investors and strategists said the moves reflected confidence in the economic recovery and the ability of central banks to tame rising prices.</p> <p>Traders have welcomed early data that Omicron may cause less severe illness than previous coronavirus strains, while new findings added to evidence that current vaccines hold up against severe Covid-19 outcomes.</p> <p>Airline and tourism shares have been particularly sensitive to disruption and are still trading well below pre-pandemic levels, but they have recovered sharply since mid-December. IAG and easyJet have surged 25 per cent since then. </p> <p>“These stocks went seriously low back in December . . . so people are getting away from that extreme negativity,” said Alex Irving, an aviation analyst at Bernstein.</p> <p>Germany added to the bullish sentiment on Tuesday, relaxing travel restrictions on the UK and several southern African nations. The UK's own travel rules, which include expensive testing before and after flights, will be reviewed on Wednesday. </p> <p>Wizz Air reported strong December passenger numbers on Tuesday, and said it had managed to fly its aircraft more than three-quarters full despite Omicron travel restrictions.</p> <p>Industry executives expected the UK government to abolish the requirement to take a pre-departure test before returning to the country as part of the review.</p> <p>One government official said the pre-departure tests would “likely” be removed, given the rampant spread of the virus domestically. </p> <p>Grant Shapps, the UK transport secretary, wants to abolish the testing rules to help the aviation sector recover, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>As part of the push to unwind the testing rules, Manchester Airports Group has submitted new research to ministers that suggests the removal of all travel restrictions this month would have no impact on the variant's spread.</p> <p>The report by consultancy Oxera, seen by the Financial Times, also stated that the curbs imposed in November had “virtually no distinguishable effect” on Omicron case rates.</p> <p>While winter travel across the globe has been badly affected by Omicron, no major airline has warned about a hit to next summer's peak season. </p> <p>David Watson, head of travel and hospitality credit at payments company Ingenico, instead pointed to “encouraging signs” for the sector, including pent-up demand for travel translating into new bookings. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Naomi Rovnick</em></p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis and Jim Pickard in London and Eric Platt in New York 2022 'Travel and leisure stocks surge as Omicron disruption fears fade' FT.com 4 January.
