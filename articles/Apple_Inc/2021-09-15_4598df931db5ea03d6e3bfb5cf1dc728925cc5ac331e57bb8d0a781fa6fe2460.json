  "text": "<p>Last month, hip-hop group the Lox went up against Dipset in front of a live audience at the same venue.</p><p>Tickets ranged from $61 to more than $250 on the day of the event, according to the Ticketmaster website. Attendees ages 12 and over have to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination. Fully vaccinated fans aren't required to wear a mask, according to the venue's website.</p><p>Producers Timbaland and Swizz Beatz founded Verzuz in March 2020, when they took turns playing their best songs for 50,000 viewers on Instagram Live. Since then, Verzuz has paired a variety of rap, hip-hop and R&amp;B artists, mostly from the past, with their contemporaries in a friendly, competitive setting. Viewers comment on the songs and debate who has the better discography.</p><p>In the early days, each artist was in his or her own home during the battle, but as Verzuz battles gained popularity, artists moved to music studios and later to venues, still absent an audience.</p><p>The production quality improved over time. In the early days of Verzuz, artists had to log on to their Instagram pages and compete with low-resolution video and unrefined audio.</p><p>\"We've increased our production quality drastically, and our viewership has been great on each Verzuz battle,\" said Gary Marella, chief executive officer and co-founder of Beatclub and a longtime business partner of Timbaland.</p><p>Triller, maker of a video-sharing app, acquired Verzuz earlier this year. Triller didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some of the biggest names in the music industry have participated in Verzuz events. The late rapper DMX went up against legendary West Coast artist Snoop Dogg. R&amp;B singers Jill Scott and Erykah Badu battled, as did Brandy and Monica.</p><p>The Verzuz featuring Keyshia Cole and Ashanti was the most watched to date, with over 6 million viewers watching some portion of the event on Instagram and Apple Music, according to the company.</p><p>Patti LaBelle and Gladys Knight battled between reminiscing about their decadeslong careers. Dionne Warwick showed up for a rendition of the '80s hit \"That's What Friends Are For.\"</p><p>The show also had game show host and comedian Steve Harvey host a battle between soul and funk legends Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and the Isley Brothers. Artists sing their songs, play recordings, or sing along with the recorded version of their songs.</p><p>There are no official winners. Billboard has concocted its own scoring system and scorecard and has announced winners.</p><p>Ciroc Vodka became a sponsor early on, and Verzuz created a licensing deal with Apple Music for 10 battles, beginning last June with a piano showdown between John Legend and Alicia Keys.</p><p>Ja Rule was one of the promoters of the ill-fated Fyre Festival in 2017. The founder of the company leading the event, Billy McFarland, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2018.</p><p>Verzuz Moves to In-Person Fan Events With Ja Rule and Fat Joe Rap Battle at Madison Square Garden</p>",
