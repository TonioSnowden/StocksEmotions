  "title": "Earnings, Consumer Data Drive Up S&P 500, Dow",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite finished up 9.01 points, or 0.1%, to 15235.71. That put the tech-heavy benchmark within a percentage point of the record close it notched in September.</p><p>Earnings season has beaten investors' expectations and helped lift stocks out of a September slump. United Parcel Service powered both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 after the delivery company topped analysts' estimates.</p><p>Investors have been buoyed by strong earnings from major banks, consumer companies and manufacturers. Jitters about the labor market and inflation have somewhat given way to optimism about a recovering economy.</p><p>Consumer confidence rose last month, halting a three-month decline, according to the Conference Board.</p><p>The latest home-sales figures from the Commerce Department highlighted an increase in purchases across the country, topping analysts' projections.</p><p>\"Covid numbers have crested, the economic data has been pretty good and the early read on third-quarter earnings is positive,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth. \"The bottom line is this is still a buy-the-dips market.\"</p><p>Now investors are turning their attention to the tech industry. Microsoft, Twitter, Google parent Alphabet and Robinhood Markets all reported after markets closed. Microsoft and Twitter shares edged higher in after-hours trading, while Alphabet and Robinhood slipped.</p><p>Of the 144 companies in the S&amp;P 500 to report quarterly earnings through Tuesday morning, 81% have beaten analyst forecasts, according to FactSet. Companies across the index are estimated to increase third-quarter earnings by 33% from a year earlier.</p><p>UPS gained $14.17, or 6.9%, to $218.07 after the delivery company reported that it continued to make money despite shipping fewer packages. General Electric rose $2.14, or 2%, to $107.44 after it said cost-cutting efforts had offset lower-than-expected sales.</p><p>Some reports disappointed investors. Facebook, which was among the first of the major tech companies to report third-quarter earnings, said late Monday that changes to Apple's privacy rules had hit sales growth. Shares slid $12.88, or 3.9%, to $315.81, putting some pressure on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.</p><p>Shares of Lockheed Martin fell $44.42, or 12%, to $331.91 after the aerospace company posted a drop in profit.</p><p>In other corporate news, DraftKings rose $1.93, or 4.1%, to $48.75 after the betting company said it was withdrawing its takeover plan for London-listed Entain.</p><p>Tech firms are likely to remain attractive to investors despite the trend of fewer people working from home and the risk of increasing regulation, Mr. Donabedian said.</p><p>\"They are battleships -- they just continue to post very strong revenue and earnings growth,\" he said.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged lower to 1.618% from Monday's 1.634%. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.7% and the Shanghai Composite was down 1%. U.S. stock futures were flat.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
