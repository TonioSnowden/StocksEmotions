The entrepreneur, who launched the poll on Sunday, was voted out by 57.5 per cent of the 17.5mn who took part.</p></li>  <li><p>EU energy ministers have agreed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b2ffae4-04d1-4e09-89ce-b85f575d8422\">gas price cap</a> to damp down the market volatility of recent months. The deal sets out a mechanism that would halt gas prices at €180 per megawatt hour once they had reached that level for three days.</p></li>  <li><p>UK ministers met to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74adbd8b-45c9-4d6c-937c-18998e8a819d\">co-ordinate responses</a> to one of the most disruptive weeks of strike action in recent history as ambulance workers, nurses, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b5a8ad6-08e5-4601-8855-1138571d604f\">customs and immigration</a> staff, postal and rail workers walk out. The disruption to travel will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fdfa4fd-23f3-4b2a-b2d2-954a16c44fc3\">cost the London hospitality industry £800mn</a>, says the sector's trade body.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e1d328-d24a-4cb4-97a1-68b78f3feb8c\"><em>live blog</em></a></p>  <p>Good evening,</p> <p>How does China open up after a long period of strict pandemic controls without endangering the lives of its citizens? </p> <p>That's the central conundrum facing policymakers in Beijing as Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61aa61f1-9145-4308-97c5-52624c2d079c\">spreads rapidly through Chinese cities</a>, causing runs on medicines and virus tests and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82629593-c67a-4ceb-93d3-d1c20c96de07\">shortages at blood banks</a>, putting an already strained health system under further stress. </p> <p>The current outbreak has brought normal life in many cities to a halt, just a few weeks after the government abruptly ditched its zero-Covid regime of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing. </p> <p>Authorities in Beijing had until the last few days <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73eba78a-1bdb-4b32-be3e-b0329470b946\">not reported any deaths</a> from the current outbreak, despite estimates suggesting more than half the capital's 22mn inhabitants have been infected.

Companies have been left with no direction on how to handle the sudden surge in cases after previously operating under strict guidelines from local governments. Local bosses are either loosening all controls or isolating workforces to keep operations running. </p> <p>Factories face the additional problem of more than 290mn migrant workers heading home for the lunar new year, a move that threatens to become a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e1f0062-279c-4390-86f8-4d331418a8f5\">superspreader event</a>”. Disruptions in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dce335aa-772a-4df3-b89c-d3f3bce1e154\">microchip factories</a> could also affect the global economy, hitting supplies for cars and industrial equipment, says the FT's Lex column. </p> <p>The financial services sector is also being hit badly, with up to half the employees at asset managers and banks in Beijing suspected to be infected. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e1d328-d24a-4cb4-97a1-68b78f3feb8c#post-3d9dd4f2-c59b-49ae-bd3a-e9edb97cf3a2\">Local stock prices</a> are also down as the Covid situation, together with global rising interest rates, outweigh optimism over reopening and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e1d328-d24a-4cb4-97a1-68b78f3feb8c#post-73db0740-bf61-4c31-a9e4-50dcb7366c2d\">pro-growth comments</a> from party and central bank officials.<br><br>The big problem, Lex points out, is that manufacturing jobs cannot be done from home. “The proportion of workers sick or absent in more than 2mn factories across various industries in China will be similar to the numbers now being seen at the large financial groups in Beijing,” it concludes. “The fallout from reopening will be prodigious.”</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p><strong>Regulatory burdens</strong> risk Europe falling behind the US in attracting investment to tackle climate change, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fb4f56d-594a-4132-a41c-8b7c66567798\">ABB's Björn Rosengren</a>, one of Europe's leading industrialists.

It will go ahead with raising the legal limit for cash transactions to €5,000, undoing efforts by the previous government to lower the cap to counter tax evasion.</p> <h1>Need to know: Global economy</h1> <p>As we wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ada57680-777e-4a5e-964b-caaa04f110ee\">last edition of DT</a>, the <strong>global fight against inflation</strong> is far from over.

He replaced Jacob Zuma in 2017 at the height of a corruption scandal and pledged to clean up the state. </p> <p><strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong> could finally get the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6da0fbe4-b085-4d1a-a30f-834faebb473f\">Nigerian presidency</a> at his sixth attempt in February's election in Africa's largest economy.
