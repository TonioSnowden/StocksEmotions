  "text": "<p>That first year, I plunged the tomatoes, all 50 pounds of them, into boiling water, then slipped off their skins and removed their stem ends before dicing them and boiling them with onion and garlic into marinara sauce. How quaint. The next year, my payload was up to about 200 pounds a week, and it's been increasing ever since. Out of necessity, I've learned a few shortcuts</p><p>My biggest lesson came the summer I was 1,200 pounds behind in my processing and needed to contract outside help. The Bauman family runs a small-scale processing plant on the edge of Amish country in Pennsylvania, near where I live. They are famous for their apple butter, but a large part of their business model is processing tomatoes for local farms. You can drop off your vegetables and, a few days later, pick up sealed jars of ketchup, or salsa, or any number of preserved products. Jars cost a few dollars each; farmers then sell them at local markets. That's why most small-farm ketchup in eastern Pennsylvania tastes the same: It's all Bauman's recipe.</p><p>I'm pretty particular about recipes; most of my business model is writing them. It took some convincing to get Bauman's to follow my recipe for salsa that year. In the end, and due in no small part to the size of the order, they conceded.</p><p>When I dropped off the produce, I asked for a quick tour, which I was immediately told no one had time for. If you want a tour of Bauman's, there is a page devoted to that on their website. (It's just a series of slightly out-of-focus photos and a few sentences explaining the apple butter process. It's a pretty bad tour, which is understandable. No one at Bauman's has time for a fancy website build-out, either.) They did let me look into the processing plant, where I saw a huge grinder chewing up whole tomatoes.</p><p>I took note and started saving myself a lot of time. Forget the peeling and the stem ends. Now I simply blend whole tomatoes, boil them down to the thickness the recipe calls for and season. My Vitamix blender can handle small, whole tomatoes; any that are larger than a tennis ball I cut in half or quarter before blending. Some recipes require more blending (ketchup or marinara), others are fine a little chunky (salsa).</p><p>These days I can keep up with the harvest, about 400 pounds of tomatoes a week. While I jar my sauces, any reasonable person who hasn't committed to such an absurd volume could easily freeze theirs until they're ready to use them. My favorite method is to fill sealable quart-size bags, zip them closed removing as much air as possible, and freeze them flat on a sheet tray. Once frozen, the flat bags stack easily in the freezer. Sauces I'll use sooner go into the fridge, and any leftover takeout container with a tight-fitting lid will do. The recipes featured here will last several weeks that way. Preserving doesn't get much easier.</p><p>---</p><p>Tomato Salsa</p><p>Serve this no-fuss, all-purpose salsa with chips or on nachos, or use it as the base for a killer chili.</p><p>Total Time: 1 1/2 hours</p><p>Makes: 2 quarts</p><p>7 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes</p><p>1 pound ripe sweet peppers, such as bell peppers, seeded and stemmed</p><p>3/4 pound onions, peeled and cut into large chunks</p><p>1-3 hot chiles, stemmed</p><p>2 cloves garlic, peeled</p><p>1/2 bunch (2 ounces) cilantro</p><p>1/3 cup vinegar</p><p>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</p><p>1 teaspoon dried oregano</p><p>1 teaspoon ground coriander</p><p>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</p><p>Ground black pepper to taste</p><p>1. Cut tomatoes in half or quarters. Use a blender or food processor to puree tomatoes in batches until coarsely ground. Transfer puree to a large heavy pot and set over high heat.</p><p>2. In a food processor, pulse peppers and onions, in batches if necessary, until chopped, then add to tomatoes. Pulse hot peppers, garlic and cilantro until finely chopped, then add them to tomatoes.</p><p>3. Add vinegar, salt, oregano, coriander, and cumin to tomatoes. Bring to boil, then lower heat gradually to bring down to a simmer. Cook until salsa thickens, stirring more frequently as tomatoes cook down, about 1 hour.</p><p>---</p><p>Ketchup</p><p>The balance here is maximum umami, minimum sweet. If you prefer your ketchup sweeter, feel free to up the sugar.</p><p>Total Time: 3 hours</p><p>Makes: 4 half-pints</p><p>2 teaspoons coriander seed</p><p>1 teaspoon cumin seed</p><p>1 teaspoon mustard seed</p><p>3 bay leaves</p><p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p><p>1 large onion, chopped</p><p>5 pounds ripe tomatoes</p><p>1 cup red wine vinegar</p><p>1/3 cup dark brown sugar</p><p>1 head roasted garlic</p><p>1/4 cup capers with their brine</p><p>1/4 cup hot sauce</p><p>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</p><p>2 tablespoons soy sauce</p><p>1 tablespoon fish sauce</p><p>2 teaspoons salt</p><p>2 teaspoons paprika</p><p>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p><p>1/2 teaspoon allspice</p><p>1. in a large dry heavy pot over medium heat, toast coriander, cumin and mustard seeds until they are several shades darker and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Use a spice grinder, coffee grinder or mortar and pestle to finely grind seeds with bay leaves.</p><p>2. Heat oil in the same pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Add remaining ingredients along with toasted, ground spices, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, about 45 minutes.</p><p>3. Transfer cooked tomato mixture to a blender or food processor, in batches if necessary, and puree. Return puree to pot, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a paste-like consistency, 1 1/2 -2 hours. Toward the end of cooking, stir ketchup more frequently to prevent scorching.</p>",
