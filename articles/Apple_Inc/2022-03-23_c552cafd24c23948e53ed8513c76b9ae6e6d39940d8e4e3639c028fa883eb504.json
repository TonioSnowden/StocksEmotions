Ukraine's army also claims to have retaken Makariv on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. </p> <p>A senior US defence official said yesterday that Russian forces were struggling with communication, logistics and fuel.

Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff, urged western nations to give his country more weapons to fight the Russians. </p> <p>“We cannot win a war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/795b432f-b189-4c91-b202-bbcb2c8b655a#post-46382d8f-8e05-4fa9-b380-69650992c492\">he wrote on Telegram</a>.</p> <p>Zelensky is expected to address a meeting of Nato leaders tomorrow via video-link and make a plea for more military support.
