  "title": "Abortion Bans Could Mean More Unwanted Children, Says Actress Rosie Perez; Performer and activist said her support for abortion rights is influenced by her childhood growing up as a ward of the state of New York",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Perez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, said she was an unwanted child who grew up in a Catholic home for children; her birth mother was Catholic and didn't believe in abortion. She suffered physical and sexual abuse as a child and said the prospect of further prohibitions on abortion across the country \"terrifies\" her.</p><p>\"There are going to be so many unwanted children in the U.S. that it pains my heart,\" she said.</p><p>On Thursday, Oklahoma's Republican-led legislature passed a near-total ban on abortion, among the latest in a series of efforts by GOP-led states laying the groundwork to ban or heavily restrict the procedure if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50-year-old ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p>Ms. Perez, an Oscar-nominated actress who stars in the HBO Max show \"The Flight Attendant\" and considers herself an activist, is one of many abortion-rights advocates who have voiced concerns after a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicated the court may strike down its 1973 precedent. Several states including Arkansas, Mississippi and Oklahoma have \"trigger laws\" that could ban all or nearly all abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned.</p><p>The prospect has brought out protestors and activists on both sides of the abortion debate.</p><p>Planned Parenthood Chief Executive Alexis McGill Johnson, speaking Wednesday at the Future of Everything Festival, said the healthcare organization is ramping up resources to prepare for a potential surge in patients seeking abortion care.</p><p>Ms. Perez, who will also star in the bilingual Apple TV+ show \"Now &amp; Then,\" has been involved in other activist and political endeavors. In 2008, she joined Rep. Nydia Vel√°zquez (D., N.Y.) to urge voters in Florida to support Barack Obama's Democratic presidential campaign. Ms. Perez's management company manages her career both as an actress and as an activist, she said.</p><p>She said she was always an activist, but \"it wasn't until I used the red carpet [that] I saw the carpet as a great platform,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com</p><p>Abortion Bans Could Mean More Unwanted Children, Says Actress Rosie Perez</p>",
