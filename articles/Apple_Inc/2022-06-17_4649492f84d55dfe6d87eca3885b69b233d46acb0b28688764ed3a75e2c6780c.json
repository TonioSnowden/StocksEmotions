Betamax and VHS home video standards, developed by rivals who would not work together. Home audio was littered with mutually-incompatible systems.</p> <p>Had Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Kodak and Fuji — who developed the photo industry's last point-and-shoot analogue film format (APS) — made it retro-compatible with 35mm (at least in film stock width) the photo-processing industry would have been more willing to embrace it. Today 35mm film is still made; APS is not. </p> <p><strong>David Healey</strong> <br><em>Burntisland, Fife, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Think of the industries that may have been saved' FT.com 17 June.
