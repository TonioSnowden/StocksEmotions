  "title": "Kanye West Is No Longer Buying Parler; Parent company says deal for the controversial social network was terminated in mid-November",
  "text": "<p>\"Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>In October, Parlement Technologies said it had entered into an agreement in principle with Mr. West to buy the platform, which has attracted millions of users by pitching itself as a \"free speech Twitter alternative.\" The financial terms of the now-terminated deal weren't disclosed at any point.</p><p>Mr. West, who now legally goes by Ye, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\"In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,\" Mr. West said in October in a Parlement Technologies press release.</p><p>The deal would have been the latest move by right-leaning individuals toward building an alternative social-media universe.</p><p>Parler, which launched in 2018, received early support from some people who were kicked off Twitter for violating that platform's content policy. Alex Jones, the extreme far-right talk-show host and conspiracy theorist, joined the social network. Mr. West went on Mr. Jones's show on Thursday, the same day as the Parler announcement, where he continued to engage in anti-Semitic rhetoric and praised Adolf Hitler.</p><p>Parler faced scrutiny in 2021 after it was revealed that people alleged to have organized the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol had used the platform to communicate. Apple Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. removed Parler from their mobile-app stores, and Amazon.com Inc. stopped providing Parler with web-hosting services.</p><p>Mr. West has been widely criticized for his anti-Semitic remarks and has been dropped from partnerships with corporations in recent months, including those with major brands like Adidas and Gap.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com</p><p>Kanye West Is No Longer Buying Parler</p>",
