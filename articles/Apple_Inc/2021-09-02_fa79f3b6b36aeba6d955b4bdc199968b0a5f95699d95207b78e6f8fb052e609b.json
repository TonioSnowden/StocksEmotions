  "text": "<p>Apple disclosed the change Wednesday, saying it was part of adjustments being made to close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission and will apply globally to reader apps available through Apple's App Store.</p><p>The changes will go into effect early next year, Apple said, and come as governments around the world have been questioning the power the company holds over third-party software developers who distribute their digital goods and services through the iPhone and iPad tablet.</p><p>A U.S. judge is weighing an antitrust case brought by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games Inc., alleging Apple was improperly limiting distribution of apps through its App Store and requiring payments to be conducted through its in-app payment system, which takes a cut as large as 30%. Apple has argued its in-app payment system protects users.</p><p>Wednesday's change wouldn't apply to Epic's case. The changes are just the latest in a string of actions in recent days that are slowly changing rules that have long been set in stone for the App Store.</p><p>While the rules have been painted by critics as tools Apple uses to wield power and control -- charges the company has denied -- the changes don't get at the heart of where Apple makes its money, such as games like \"Fortnite.\"</p><p>Rather, Wednesday's these changes are targeted at apps providing purchased or subscription content for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music and video.</p><p>\"Because developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let developers of these apps share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account,\" Apple said on its website.</p><p>While Apple added that in-app purchases through its App Store \"remain the safest and most trusted payment methods for users,\" the company said it would work with developers of reader apps to protect users when they link to external websites for purchases.</p><p>Even with the changes, Spotify and others still won't be able sell subscriptions in their apps without Apple taking a cut.</p><p>Netflix declined to comment, while a Spotify spokeswoman said the company will need to evaluate the changes but noted that such an amendment to guidelines won't solve all of its disputes with Apple.</p><p>The Japanese commission said the change by Apple \"would eliminate the suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act and decided to close the investigation on this case after confirming that the measure has been actually taken.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
