  "title": "The Property Report:  Ex-Industrial  Area Turns  Into a Draw  ---  London neighborhood emerges as one of the  city's hottest, luring Apple, other big names  ----  By Ruth Bloomfield",
  "text": "<p>   President Trump once dismissed the London neighborhood of Nine Elms as \"lousy\" and \"horrible.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump made his remarks in 2018, after the American Embassy left its historic base in upscale Mayfair for a newly constructed building 3 miles south. </p><p>   Today, Nine Elms is emerging as one of London's hottest real-estate markets. The 561-acre tract of formerly industrial land beside the Thames is luring big technology names like Apple Inc., an American book publisher and luxury hotel operators. The district will soon be home to what a developer says will be the world's first \"sky pool,\" which will sit suspended between two towers. </p><p>   Nine Elms' redevelopment started a decade ago and now features more than 40 individual projects with a combined cost of GBP 15 billion, equivalent to $20.5 billion. When the projects are completed around 2030, more than 25,000 people are expected to work in the district and as many as 40,000 people will call it home. </p><p>   Home prices have been rising, despite the pandemic, which slowed overall sales activity. </p><p>   The average price of a Nine Elms apartment crossed the $1 million mark for the first time last year. That price was $1,086,180 at the end of 2020, up 13% from the end of 2019, according to property portal Zoopla. </p><p>   Apple plans to take possession of a building in Nine Elms this year, taking 500,000 square feet of office space within Battersea Power Station, a decommissioned coal-fired power plant on the west side of the neighborhood that is being renovated. </p><p>   About 1,400 employees from around London will be based at the landmark building, owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors, making it one of the tech giant's largest sites outside North America. </p><p>   A new metro station, linking the neighborhood to the London Underground network, is also poised to open this year. Hyatt Hotels Corp. said it plans to open a 203-room Park Hyatt hotel in Nine Elms as early as next year. </p><p>   \"It's an area we believe will see huge demand for both leisure and business travel,\" said Felicity Black-Roberts, Hyatt's vice president of development, Europe. </p><p>   New residential projects include Embassy Gardens, which features the sky pool. The joint development by Irish house builder Ballymore and EcoWorld International will include 1,500 apartments upon completion later this year. It will also be home to offices for New York-based publisher Penguin Random House. </p><p>   The initial focus at Nine Elms has been apartment buildings. Mayrow Short, head of real-estate agent Savills' local office, said the best apartments -- those on upper floors with views of the Thames -- change hands at up to GBP 2,500 a square foot, a similar rate as in London's prime central zone, which includes Mayfair. </p><p>   Battersea Power Station will offer a shopping mall with high-end brands including Hugo Boss and MAC Cosmetics, bars and restaurants, an art-house movie theater and event spaces. </p><p>   There are also plans for the refurbishment of New Covent Garden Market, the U.K.'s largest wholesale fruit, vegetable and flower market, with more homes, offices, retail and leisure facilities. </p><p>   Not every Londoner disagrees entirely with Mr. Trump's assessment. Tom Floyd, sales director at real-estate agent Winkworth, said a majority of homes at Nine Elms are owned by overseas investors who rent them out. Its transient population means, he added, the area lacks a sense of community and some buildings are apparently largely empty. </p><p>   \"If you drive past there are no lights on in the evening,\" Mr. Floyd said. </p><p>   But he is hopeful. \"I think that when Battersea Power Station opens it will really be the epicenter of Nine Elms, because it will become a destination,\" Mr. Floyd said. \"I think it will be great. It is just not a finished product.\" </p><p></p>",
