  "text": "<p>Former US president Donald Trump will soon return to social media with “his own platform”, one of his senior advisers has said, following Twitter's permanent ban of his account. </p> <p>Jason Miller, Trump's senior adviser, told Fox News that Trump would be “returning to social media in probably about two or three months here, with his own platform”. </p> <p>“I think this will be the hottest ticket in social media, it's going to completely redefine the game, and everybody is going to be waiting and watching to see what exactly president Trump does, but it will be his own platform,” Miller said.</p> <p>Miller declined to provide further details on the nature of the venture but said “there have been a lot of high-powered meetings at Mar-a-Lago” with “numerous companies”, referring to the ex-president's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272e81f3-b731-4c28-b4c2-9eb798717b46\">Palm Beach resort</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>In January, Twitter said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d44a5127-ce1e-407c-bce2-293be771cd1f\">permanently ban Trump's account</a> from its platform, citing the risk of the US president using the site to incite further violence following the storming of Capitol Hill by a mob of his supporters.&#xa0;</p> <p>In doing so, the company removed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6df12c33-e7a3-482b-92da-8c3549789a6b\">megaphone</a> that the former president had used to obsessively broadcast to his 88m followers, with a mix of vitriol aimed at political enemies and over-the-top praise for his allies.</p> <p>Trump would often surprise the Washington political establishment by making consequential policy announcements <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a962c1f8-ee44-11e6-930f-061b01e23655\">by tweet</a>, sometimes late at night. </p> <p>In the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c471c49-de90-4f5f-9c91-19be0daa491c\">attack on the US Capitol</a> in early January, social media companies were forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1629cfce-15c0-416b-b91a-b1234a2a151e\">defend themselves</a> against accusations of having facilitated the assault by allowing the spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation by far-right groups, as well as by the president himself.</p> <p>At the same time, conservatives have argued that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78a3ed8c-d930-4bf5-9f6e-1b6b4751090f\">social media companies</a>, and Twitter in particular, are biased against them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8aad916d-015e-438c-ba84-d363c388ede3\">Parler's</a> attempt to attract users to its&#xa0;platform&#xa0;with the promise of fewer restrictions, which led conservatives to believe they might have found an alternative to Twitter, was thwarted when Amazon Web Services suspended the app's web hosting. Apple and Google had already moved to eject it from their mobile app stores.</p> <p>The ex-president last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3238c3c-9fa2-4024-8a69-94600edf3bac\">teased supporters</a> with a possible return to politics at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida.</p> <p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc81c3df-f6c0-47c2-8efc-5a14d511f7e7\">impeached</a> for a second time by the House of Representatives in January after lawmakers charged him with “incitement to insurrection” for his role in stirring up a mob of supporters that stormed the Capitol.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/c1f6dd0e-b702-41ad-bde3-9e9a43e8c84b.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Aime Williams in Washington 2021 'Trump to return to social media with own platform, adviser says' FT.com 21 March.
