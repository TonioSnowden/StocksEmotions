  "title": "A Nation Asks: Are We Ferocious Lions or Peaceful Cats? A new sculpture of India's national emblem divides citizens; 'It looks like a steroid-fed version of a lion'",
  "text": "<p>No pussycat</p><p>India's emblem, adopted in 1950, is modeled after a sculpture dating back more than 2,000 years to the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who famously renounced armed conquest to take up Buddhism and promote peace. The new 21-foot-tall cast, weighing in at around 21,000 pounds, went atop a parliament building being built in New Delhi.</p><p>Some called the fangs in the new version too prominent. Others said the lions appear far brawnier than ones from a third century B.C. original, as well as renditions appearing on Indian currency or other government buildings.</p><p>The question has ignited a roaring debate over what the sculpture says about modern-day India and the image the country wants to send to the world.</p><p>\"Why should our lions look ferocious and full of angst?\" said S. Irfan Habib, a retired professor of the history of science and of modern politics in New Delhi. The fangs in particular put his teeth on edge.</p><p>\"It looks like a steroid-fed version of a lion,\" said Charanjiv Kalha, a 49-year-old software consultant in Delhi, of the new sculpture. \"This one definitely looks aggressive, irritated, as if he wants to go and pounce on someone.\"</p><p>Two lawyers have filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India to direct the government to \"correct\" the sculpture. They say the new cast violates the description and design of the emblem laid out by law.</p><p>Sriram Seshadri, a 51-year-old consultant in Chennai, said he prefers a pugnacious lion to a \"soft and passive lion,\" to represent a country that \"is marching ahead to become a superpower.\"</p><p>\"They are lions, not cute puppies. What's wrong in showing their ferocity?\" wrote another supporter on Twitter.</p><p>Historians who have studied Ashoka's lions say they weren't meant to rouse fear; rather they were part of 30-foot or taller stone pillars Ashoka put up in parts of India to propagate Buddha's teachings. In one of the best-preserved examples—kept in a museum in the town of Sarnath, where Buddha is said to have given his first sermon, and on which the national emblem is based—the lions stand back-to-back on a circular abacus that includes four wheels representing Buddhist doctrine.</p><p>The government has said the cast is a replica of the original in Sarnath, and might appear different because it is much larger and is viewed from a different angle.</p><p>An artist who made the sculpture for the new parliament building said the team closely studied Ashoka's lions. \"We have made it same to same,\" said sculptor Sunil Deore. Nearly 100 people worked on it for nearly nine months, he said.</p><p>Mr. Deore said people might find the sculpture different because of its scale. \"Think of a regular-sized nose. If I were to blow it up into a 10-foot-by-10-foot structure, then how would it look?\" he said. \"It will look different.\"</p><p>That hasn't stopped citizens from trying to read more into the art. Sourav Giri, 31-year-old teacher of English literature in Gangasagar and a supporter of Mr. Modi, described the lions in the earlier versions as looking courteous, and the new lions as more aggressive. \"Maybe the government is giving an important message that in the new era, people of India will not be polite in comparison to the last decade,\" he said.</p><p>Political analysts see parallels with the vision of a more assertive country taking shape under Mr. Modi, an adherent of a Hindu nationalist ideology. Some political observers say this worldview has been accompanied with less tolerance toward dissent, which the government disputes.</p><p>It's a shift from when the philosophy of nonviolence, as espoused by Mahatma Gandhi to oppose British colonial rule, was seen as an intrinsic part of India's identity.</p><p>\"This lion shows that, 'Don't mess with me because I will come to attack you,' \" said Navnita Chadha Behera, a professor of political science at the University of Delhi. \"But is that the India I want to be?\"</p><p>On a recent Sunday afternoon, the streets around the new parliament building were mostly empty except for security personnel and laborers. The building is still under construction—part of Mr. Modi's redevelopment of the British colonial-era portion of the capital—and hidden behind blue corrugated sheeting. The emblem can be seen from afar, but the facial expressions aren't clear at that distance.</p><p>Lakhan Singh, a 42-year-old laborer who helped polish and assemble the emblem and was outside on break, said the new lions look different because they're made out of metal, while Ashoka's lions were sculpted out of stone.</p><p>\"If you see it in the dark,\" he said, \"you will be scared.\"</p><p>Write to Shefali Anand at shefali.anand@wsj.com</p><p>A Nation Asks: Are We Ferocious Lions or Peaceful Cats?</p>",
