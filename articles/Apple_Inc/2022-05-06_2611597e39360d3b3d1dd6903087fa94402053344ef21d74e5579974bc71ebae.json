  "title": "Stocks Dive In Dizzying About-Face --- Tech rout brings market down from previous day's rally as rate reality sets in",
  "text": "<p>The optimism behind that rally was long gone Thursday, when selling was widespread, though most intense in the technology shares that have fallen on hard times in 2022 after years of leading the market advance.</p><p>Tesla dropped 8.3% and Amazon.com fell 7.6%. Bank stocks, a key indicator of economic expectations, dropped 2.7%, according to the KBW Nasdaq index of large commercial lenders. The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. companies declined 4%.</p><p>\"The market yesterday was a relief rally,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. By Thursday, she said, the realities of a more challenging environment for stocks were starting to settle in, including higher rates, difficult earnings comparisons and a stronger U.S. dollar that weighs on overseas earnings at multinational companies.</p><p>Thursday's rout is the latest instance of the volatility that has characterized markets this year and highlights the unease over the likely impact of the Fed's rate-increase campaign, which aims to reverse years of easy policy.</p><p>That unease is amplifying the tendency of many investors to sell some shares into market rallies, in a bid to rebalance portfolios that may have become too concentrated in the shares of firms that benefited from pandemic-era stimulus.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 647.16 points, or 5%, to 12317.69, the largest one-day percentage decline since June 2020. The S&amp;P dropped 153.30 points, or 3.6%, to 4146.87, and the Dow slid 1,063.09, or 3.1%, to 32997.97. The major indexes fell between 7.02 and 9.38 percentage points from Wednesday's highs to Thursday's lows, according to Dow Jones Market Data, their largest swings since the first half of 2020.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.066%, the highest yield level since November 2018. Bond prices fall when yields rise.</p><p>The pullback came a day after major U.S. stock indexes soared, with the Dow climbing more than 900 points, its biggest one-day gain since 2020. On Wednesday, central-bank officials approved a half-percentage-point rate increase, lifting the federal-funds rate to a target range between 0.75% and 1%.</p><p>\"The Fed is reducing liquidity in the markets and that's driving up volatility, and so this could be our new normal here for a bit until the Fed gets inflation under control and changes the policy,\" said John Ingram, chief investment officer and partner at Crestwood Advisors.</p><p>Even with a larger rate increase off the table in the coming months, investors are facing the most aggressive tightening of U.S. monetary policy since 2000 -- the last time the Fed last raised rates by a half point. Though many investors say the market setup then was drastically different from the one now -- with valuations higher and many of the highest-flying dot-com firms lacking long-term prospects -- it isn't lost on them that that year ended with sharp declines for the major indexes.</p><p>Many investors are questioning how high the Fed might raise rates over the next two years and how that might ripple across the economy and corporate profits.</p><p>On Thursday, those jitters were seen across the market. Growth stocks were particularly hard hit. Chip makers Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors all declined at least 4%. Megacap technology stocks also pulled back, with Meta Platforms falling 6.8%, Netflix declining 7.7% and Apple slipping 5.6%.</p><p>Higher rates can diminish the allure of tech stocks by reducing the value that investors place on their future earnings. Higher yields in general boost the attractiveness of fixed-income products versus riskier assets such as stocks.</p><p>Some of the darlings of the pandemic lost ground. Etsy tumbled 17%, after the online marketplace released guidance below expectations for the current quarter. EBay lost 12% after cutting guidance on effects from the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Shares of Wayfair slid, losing 26% after the online home goods retailer posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Shopify's first-quarter earnings missed analysts' expectations, sending the stock down 15%.</p><p>Bucking the trend, shares of Twitter jumped 2.7% after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said he received letters from investors committing more than $7 billion in fresh financing to boost the equity part of his offer to buy the company.</p><p>Booking Holdings jumped 3.3% after its revenue exceeded expectations and it said it saw strengthening of global travel trends in the current quarter.</p><p>Even after Wednesday's rally, some strategists and investors said they were hesitant about the stock market's outlook.</p><p>If the Fed tries \"to do too much and the market comes unglued, then [Fed officials] kind of shot themselves in the foot because it will make it difficult to do future rate hikes,\" said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer at ACM Funds. \"That's the fine line the Fed is trying to walk -- to do as much as they think the market can digest without upsetting it too much.\"</p><p>In oil markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, rose 0.7% to $110.90 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together called OPEC+, met Thursday to discuss production targets.</p><p>Assets that investors perceive as safer were among those to rally as money managers looked for havens. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 1.1%. The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency makes it a particularly attractive haven.</p><p>Gold prices climbed, rising 0.4% to $1,874 a troy ounce.</p><p>The British pound fell about 2% against the dollar after the Bank of England raised rates, but signaled it is likely to move cautiously in coming months as recession worries grow.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.4%, and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.7%. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.</p>",
