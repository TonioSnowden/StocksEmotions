  "title": "The Man Who Builds Great Golf Courses; Golf-course architect Gil Hanse on why Bob Hope was (mostly) wrong when he said he could design a course in three hours",
  "text": "<p>That list includes Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., the site of this year's PGA Championship a month ago; The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., where the U.S. Open is being held this week; Los Angeles Country Club, where the U.S. Open will be held next year; and Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., where the Open was played in 2020. The golf events at the Rio Olympics in 2016 were held on a course he designed. Currently, he's constructing a course in the desert outside Palm Springs, Calif., for entertainment mogul Irving Azoff and Apple Inc. executive Eddy Cue.</p><p>Mr. Hanse, 58 years old, talked with The Wall Street Journal about the state of golf-course architecture today and what's next. Here are edited excerpts of that conversation.</p><p>The Bob Hope formula</p><p>WSJ: Bob Hope once said that he could lay out a golf course in three hours. \"Build this par 3 over the water, install a trap there to catch the tee shots on the dogleg of a par 4. It's not such a big deal,\" he said. What's the biggest misconception from regular golfers about the role of a course architect and about what an architect actually does?</p><p>MR. HANSE: Most every golfer looks at golf-course architecture through the lens of strategy or the positioning of features in a landscape. When viewed through that lens it can be fairly straightforward in appearance, as Mr. Hope points out. However, there is another side to the design of golf courses that most people give little thought to, and that is the practical or technical side of the design. The building of a course—the drainage, the irrigation, the earth movement, the specification of materials—all of this is an amazingly choreographed process.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I still believe that the strategy, the organization, the maximizing of natural features and the presentation of the course are the most important factors in golf-course architecture. However, from the perspective of what goes underappreciated by the golfer, I think it is the technical side.</p><p>WSJ: What are the qualities that make for a great golf course—and for a great golf hole?</p><p>Related</p><p>* The PGA Tour Banned LIV Golfers. They're Playing in the PGA Tour Anyway.</p><p>MR. HANSE: There are so many qualities that make for a great golf course, but the quality that ties them all together is a sense of place. To have a sense of place equates to a sense of scale, a merging with the natural landscape, the innate sense of things feeling right. Within this context, the rest of the features that we equate with greatness—greens, bunkers, fairways, etc.—can live in harmony with their surroundings.</p><p>A great golf hole makes you think. Alan Wilson, the brother of Merion Golf Club course architect Hugh Wilson, said that the goal of a good golf hole is to ask the golfer to \"take a present risk to secure a future advantage.\" Great golf holes follow this principle, and make you think from the green backwards, so that your tee shot is thoughtfully placed to gain a better angle for the approach.</p><p>The best holes ask the golfer to do this in unique and creative ways, using the natural lay of the land to provide the bones for the strategy and then allowing the architect to provide the flesh in the features. It of course is helpful if they are organized beautifully in the landscape or the features serve to flatter the natural characteristics of the landforms. By doing so, the architect gives the hole a sense of place as one piece of an 18-hole puzzle.</p><p>Designing fun in</p><p>WSJ: What do you see as trending in golf-course design right now?</p><p>MR. HANSE: Fun! I believe that there has been a focused effort to create fun golf venues, whether they are alternative venues or traditional golf courses. Fun in golf can come in many shapes and sizes: putting courses, par-3 courses, Topgolf [a driving-range game], or it can come in the form of creating fun and interesting holes to play on a full-size course.</p><p>Jim Wagner and I are always looking at ways to create fun, cool golf shots—the type of shots that make you want to say, \"Watch this!\" These creative shots have their foundation in links golf, where the fun does not start until the ball hits the ground and then it can go in any different direction. We try to create recovery options that allow the golfer to be creative, where the direct line to the hole may not be the best route to take. We love to encourage golfers to look around for alternate routes to the hole and to use slopes to feed balls off of to reach their ultimate destination.</p><p>When we built Castle Stuart in Scotland with Mark Parsinen, Mark used to always say that the best recovery shots keep golfers hopeful and engaged. Hopeful in that they can mentally see themselves hitting the shot, and engaged in that the outcome should be full of opportunities provided by the architecture and the skill of the player. To pull off these types of shots provides the ultimate fun for golfers and designers alike.</p><p>Water without waste</p><p>WSJ: Some regions are running low on water, notably in the Western U.S. How do you counter critics who say golf courses are water wasters?</p><p>MR. HANSE: We need to do a better job of making sure golf courses are viewed as critical open-space resources for communities, of communicating that they provide critical habitat in developed settings, and that the water they use is mostly returned into the groundwater after being filtered by the course. As usual, it is a perception issue and one we need to do a better job of controlling the narrative on.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think makes for a great golf course? Join the conversation below.</p><p>WSJ: Slow play has long been a negative with golf. What can be achieved through the course design itself or maintenance practices to assist in getting golfers around the course more quickly?</p><p>MR. HANSE: A focus on walking-friendly golf courses would be a big step in the right direction. By this I mean greens and tees in close proximity, to cut down on the travel time between holes. Golf is meant to be a walking game, and while it might be counterintuitive, golfers who walk, as opposed to sharing a cart, can play just as fast, especially if the course sets them up for success.</p><p>On the design end of things, creating ground-game options for recovery, leaving approaches to greens open so shots can be run up onto greens, and having greens roll at a reasonable speed all can help to speed up play.</p><p>At the end of the day, pace of play is mostly about being observant and being ready to play when it is your turn. If golfers are engaged and invested in moving things along, then the maintenance and design of the holes become secondary considerations in pace-of-play concerns. </p><p>Mr. Hanse at the course under construction outside Palm Springs. PHOTO: Adam Amengual for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Renovation boom</p><p>WSJ: How do you see course design and/or course maintenance evolving in the coming years?</p><p>MR. HANSE: I believe we will continue to see an emphasis on promoting playability, fun and accessibility for all levels of golfers.</p><p>In our segment of the golf business, we are seeing a boom in renovation and restoration business. For about 15 years, it seemed that only the financially successful or historic clubs had the ability to fund large-scale projects to improve their product. Recently, with the influx of golfers and the strength of the economy, even the second- and third-tier clubs are taking on projects that make their courses better.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there seems to be renewed emphasis on housing-development courses. These developments had faded over the last decade and a half, with the popularity of the game waning, with the housing-market collapse [around the time of the financial crisis] mostly to blame. I thought that the era of golf courses used as an amenity to sell real estate was dead and gone. However, with the Covid bump for the game and with a large number of people relocating to warmer climates, either for primary or secondary homes, it seems that there are a lot of these types of projects popping up.</p><p>I see this as a bad trend, as it generally creates courses and land plans that are seldom predicated on high-quality golf, are frequently unwalkable and rarely have that sense of place that makes courses great.</p><p>Mr. Passov is a writer in Cave Creek, Ariz.
