Marine biologist Loveday Trinick and illustrator Teagan White survey a wide range of saltwater creatures in \"Oceanarium\" (Big Picture, 96 pages, $37.99), the latest installment in the \"Welcome to the Museum\" series. As in a natural-history museum, most of the marine life under discussion is divvied up by type and put on display. Scientific-seeming plates and full-page illustrations of ocean habitats show a great multiplicity of mammals, birds, fish, mollusks and more. Even a short visit to one of the book's \"galleries\" will leave children ages 7-12 knowing more than when they arrived. </p><p>\n  In a section devoted to the squishy invertebrates known as cnidaria, for instance, there's an extended passage about the Portuguese Man-of-War, the well-known predator that kills with its long, fluttering, toxic tentacles. Despite its gelatinous appearance, Ms. Trinick explains, this \"ocean wanderer\" is not a true jellyfish but in fact \"a colony made up of four types of tiny living organisms called polyps. Each polyp type has a role to play, and all of them work together to behave as one animal known as a siphonophore.\" Teagan White's picture of this chimeric animal, glowing violet and indigo against an inky deep-sea background, is likely to induce awe, respect and the hope never to come across such a venomous thing in the wild. </p><p>\n  For the beach-bound family, \"What a Shell Can Tell\" (Phaidon, 48 pages, $19.95) may be as useful in bad traffic, as a diversion, as at the shore, as a primer. In its pages, Helen Scales, a marine biologist, tells readers ages 6-9 about seashells: \"Where They Live, What They Eat, How They Move, and More,\" as the book's front cover has it. Shells neither eat nor live, of course, but this inviting book more than makes up for the imprecision of its subtitle with the colorful splendor of Sonia Pulido's pictures and the useful detail of Ms. Scales's text. \"If a shell comes in two parts that fit together then it's a bivalve, meaning 'two doors,'\" we read. The category includes scallops, \"which look like fans,\" and razor clams, \"which look like long, thin fingernails,\" and heart cockles, \"which look like . . . well, little hearts!\" Each of these descriptions comes with an illustration that will make it easy for children to learn and remember different types of shells. They may even end up knowing what they're finding when they're combing the sand. </p><p>\n  In 1770, Capt. James Cook's ship Endurance seemed to run aground in open water off Australia. \"At first, Captain Cook and his crew were baffled,\" writes the same Helen Scales in \"The Great Barrier Reef\" (Flying Eye, 86 pages, $19.99), a non-fiction picture book illustrated by Lisk Feng. The sailors, she continues, \"were forced to throw many of their belongings into the sea in order to float the ship and save themselves. They were astonished to find what lay beneath.\" The matte pages of this beautiful volume are intended to persuade children ages 7-12 to feel a degree of astonishment themselves. </p><p>\n  The Great Barrier Reef is the largest such system in the world, running more than 1,400 miles along the coast of Australia. Along it, Ms. Scales writes, \"are islands of gleaming white sand fringed in green mangrove forests, and winding ribbons of reef.\" In Ms. Feng's riveting, color-saturated pictures, we see some of the reef's denizens: crabs, tiger sharks, chambered nautiluses and parrotfish that cleverly create bubbles \"of sticky, foul-smelling goo\" to repel parasites while they're snoozing. Contemporary books about the natural world for children almost always contain cautionary passages about man's baleful influence, and while \"The Great Barrier Reef\" is no exception, its ominous passages about coral bleaching and the problems posed by plastic in the sea are balanced by hopeful explanations of efforts being made to preserve the reef. </p><p>\n  Let us go on land now, in a manner of speaking, and make our way to northern Australia. There, to judge from \"A Kunwinjku Counting Book\" (Enchanted Lion, 40 pages, $19.95), a person can find many a curious animal: the goanna, the spoonbill, the echidna and the wallaby. Written by Gabriel Maralngurra and Felicity Wright, and illustrated by Mr. Maralngurra, this lovely volume evokes the language and ancient artwork of the indigenous Bininj people. The pictures are rendered with stylized silhouettes and crosshatching known as rarrk, all done in earthy colors of black, white, yellow ochre and terracotta. In the typical style of counting books, we begin with one crocodile and build up to 12 barramundi fish; but in other respects the book may leave children behind. The text mingles English with Kunwinjku, the language of the Bininj, so may be a challenge for most 6- to 8-year-olds to read for themselves. For shared reading, though, with an adult decoding the text (and taking pronunciation cues from the end notes), it should work well. </p><p>\n  An adult will probably be the best first interpreter, too, for \"A Is for Bee: An Alphabet Book in Translation\" (Levine Querido, 40 pages, $17.99), an ingenious abecedary created and illustrated by Ellen Heck. The conceit is beguiling: Words that to us are axiomatic in their spelling are pronounced quite differently among other peoples in the world. The letter A, which, in English-language alphabet books, typically introduces words such as Apple or Astronaut or Airplane, is in other tongues (Igbo, Turkish, Ojibwe and Portuguese) the first letter of the word for our Bee. Ms. Heck has mined dozens of languages for her examples, which she illustrates with bold shapes, lines and colors. </p><p></p>",
