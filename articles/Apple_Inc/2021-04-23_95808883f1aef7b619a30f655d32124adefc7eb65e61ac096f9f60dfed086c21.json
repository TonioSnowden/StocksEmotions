  "text": "<p>In an age when so many critically acclaimed series are lauded for their “slow-burning” approach, there is something almost refreshing about watching a show brazenly start with a dramatic computer-generated shot of flames bursting to life within a furnace.</p> <p>This is the effective, if fairly literal, statement of tonal intent presented by Apple TV Plus's pacy new seven-part series, loosely based on Paul Theroux's 1981 novel of the same name. From that cold (or rather, hot) opener onwards, nearly every scene of this thriller about a fugitive, Allie Fox (the author's nephew, Justin Theroux) and his family, seems freighted with the potential to suddenly ignite into a moment of crisis. By the second episode, even a lingering shot on something as innocuous as a dented plastic water container will be enough of a cue for your pulse to quicken.</p> <p>This unshakeable sense of volatility stems from the highly precarious nature of the Foxes' existence on the run from the authorities. For nine years they have occupied spaces on the fringes of society, waiting for the inevitable moment when the police locate the family's latest foxhole.</p> <p>So why is a handyman-cum-inventor such a wanted man? The answer is at first tantalisingly, then frustratingly, left unanswered for now. In lieu of crucial character information, a breathless procession of brilliantly executed car chases, last-gasp escapes, robberies and desert shootouts ensures that you remain sufficiently engrossed (or distracted).&#xa0;</p> <p>But at times — especially during the quite literal Mexican stand-off in the scorched waste of the southern US border — you get the sense that the show is trying a little transparently to replicate the alchemy that turned the blood and sand of <em>Breaking Bad</em> into TV gold. Allie himself appears set up to become an anti-hero in the vein of Walter White — though the story of the latter's gradual descent into evil is rather more compelling than one about a man who is seemingly just keeping a pre-existing darkness in check.</p> <p>Theroux accordingly delivers a textured performance that sees him convincingly oscillate between a harmless eccentric and a menacing charlatan whose lectures about the iniquity and inequalities besetting America perhaps serve only to masquerade or justify his own criminality.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's through these prolix political speeches that <em>The Mosquito Coast </em>most notably stifles its own momentum, both in terms of pacing and, more broadly, in the way that a diatribe against commercialism feels more like a product of 1981 than today. It may not be the most urgent, incendiary show of the year, but it's still anything but a slow burner.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from April 30</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2021 'The Mosquito Coast: tantalising action on Apple TV Plus' FT.com 23 April.
