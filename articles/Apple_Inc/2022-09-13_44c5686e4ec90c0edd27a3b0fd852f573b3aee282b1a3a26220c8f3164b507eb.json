An Exchange article on Saturday about Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub incorrectly said Berkshire increased its stake to nearly 27%. Also, after Occidental acquired Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Ms. Hollub cut thousands of jobs from the combined company through a voluntary buyout program and a smaller number of jobs with a layoff. The article incorrectly said she implemented \"widespread layoffs.\" </p><p>   (See: \"EXCHANGE --- A CEO's Big Bet On Big Oil Pays Off --- Occidental Petroleum's Vicki Hollub, facing a revolt led by Carl Icahn, got help from rising crude prices and Warren Buffett\" -- WSJ Sept. 10, 2022) </p><p>   --- </p><p>    To add a website icon to the iPhone's home screen, tap the Share button in Safari, then select Add to Home Screen.
