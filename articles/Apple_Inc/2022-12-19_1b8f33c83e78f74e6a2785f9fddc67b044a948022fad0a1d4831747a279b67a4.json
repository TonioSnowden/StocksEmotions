  "text": "<h1>The Bear</h1> <p>If you can't take the heat, turn off the TV. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cb55d07-9abf-4dee-a984-1761a95fbc1c\">This blistering restaurant kitchen drama</a> serves up a sensory overload with a side helping of intense anxiety. It follows Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White), a world-renowned gourmet chef who returns to Chicago to take over his brother's diner after the latter dies of suicide. The day-to-day exigencies of running a restaurant are captured with a punishing immediacy — not least in one single-take episode — but the show really excels as an honest, darkly funny study of male ego, emotional fragility and unprocessed grief. </p> <p><em>On Disney Plus in the UK and Hulu in the US</em></p> <h1>Severance</h1> <p>In a TV landscape largely dominated by adaptations and reboots, this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/102ba3d3-1541-4879-80b0-b0e4525121e8\">weird and wonderful sci-fi thriller</a> stands out as one of the most imaginative series of the past few years. A heady cocktail of Orwellian dystopia, workplace satire and metaphysical mystery, it revolves around the employees of a shadowy company who have been fitted with a brain implant that “severs” them from their identities as soon as they enter the office. Come for the masterly plotting and offbeat humour, stay for 2022's most unlikely screen romance between John Turturro and Christopher Walken. </p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus</em></p> <h1>Station Eleven</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c24ae707-5ec8-4e87-b511-e7aaac2bec7a\">Emily St John Mandel</a>'s 2014 book about the aftermath of a devastating pandemic was a piece of speculative future fiction; the TV adaptation, meanwhile, offered a mirror image of our recent past. Those who can bear to watch something that begins with a mysterious “flu in Asia” will be rewarded with an intricate, intelligent and unexpectedly life-affirming series that combines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af2f61b9-eef5-4a78-b156-c311c56e079f\">a gripping post-apocalyptic survival story</a> with a thoughtful meditation on how storytelling sustains us.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>On Lionsgate Plus in the UK and HBO Max in the US</em></p> <h1>The Rehearsal</h1> <p>What exactly was <em>The Rehearsal</em>? An absurdist comedy? A feverish reality show? A revealing anthropological study? The series begins with Nathan Fielder helping people meticulously prepare for daunting future events. But within three episodes it morphs into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a271048-c968-43e1-b42b-1202b6a8a1d2\">a surreal, vaguely unsettling social experiment</a> in which the comedian seemingly uses unsuspecting people to gain a better understanding of his own, let's say, “unusual” mind. If it's scripted, Fielder is a genius. If it's all real then he's still a genius, but very possibly an evil one. </p> <p><em>On NOW in the UK and HBO Max in the US</em></p> <h1>Pachinko</h1> <p>The brutal realities and enduring scars of the Japanese occupation of Korea are laid bare in the story of one multigenerational family in <em>Pachinko</em>. As the show adeptly negotiates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b03e75fd-4be9-48fd-97e0-7a53de44dea8\">a time-hopping narrative</a> spanning seven decades, it never loses sight of the finer details — allowing us, at one point, to see a character's whole world in a grain of rice. Striking performances are complemented by painterly cinematography in this superlative drama that doesn't put a foot wrong from its inspired opening credits to its moving epilogue. </p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus</em></p> <h1>Russia 1985-1999: Traumazone</h1> <p>Adam Curtis's seven-hour survey of the collapse of communism and post-Soviet democracy makes for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dce9754-e3d6-491e-ac3a-1b4488abd5f8\">imperative, immersive and draining viewing</a>. Shorn of the filmmaker's usual gimmicks — the knowingly portentous narration, the ambient techno soundtrack — the series largely lets the expertly chosen pieces of archive film speak for themselves. Some images — such as those captured first hand from inside Chernobyl — seem almost inconceivable; other footage — the devastation wrought by Russia in the first Chechen war — is devastatingly familiar. </p> <p><em>On BBC iPlayer in the UK</em></p> <h1>The English</h1> <p>Hugo Blick's stirring tribute to the Westerns of yore could have been called <em>The Good, the Bad and the Beautiful</em>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3402201-5cf2-447b-890f-e36d0490bc6e\">An absorbing, unhurried tale</a> that exhibits humanity at its most compassionate and most cruel, it plays out against the stunning backdrop of the forbidding American west of the 1890s. There's much to relish too in the performances of Emily Blunt and Chaske Spencer as the aristocratic Englishwoman seeking to avenge her son's death and the Pawnee native who accompanies her on an epic journey through a hostile land.</p> <p><em>On BBC iPlayer in the UK and Amazon Prime Video&#xa0;in the US</em></p> <h1>Abbott Elementary</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b130da1-b605-4a1f-aa32-f0b6bcec6af3\">This charming mockumentary</a> set in a crumbling Philadelphia public school comes top of 2022's class for TV comedy. Showrunner Quinta Brunson stars as a bright-eyed teacher striving to make a difference in a school where the ABCs are abject funding, burnout and corruption. She's supported by a stellar ensemble of cynics, straight men, oddballs and scene-stealers who deliver ample laughs and the occasional reminder of how undervalued educators often are. </p> <p><em>On Disney Plus in the UK and Hulu in the US</em></p> <h1>Bad Sisters</h1> <p>Sharon Horgan's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1afefaa-2e81-4e3a-938d-153c08c7b1aa\">brilliantly macabre series</a> offers up (almost) 50 ways to kill your sister's lover. Based on a Belgian black comedy, it follows four wildly different but inseparable Irish sisters as they concoct several unsuccessful schemes to murder their other sibling's abusive husband (a monstrously good Claes Bang). The warm, organic rapport between the cast keeps the show grounded despite the rather outlandish premise, but the prevailing sense of levity also leaves us disarmed for the emotionally wrenching turns that the show takes towards the end. </p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus</em>&#xa0;</p> <h1>The White Lotus</h1> <p>The one-per-cent-skewering series makes a stay at the Hotel California seem like a comparatively peaceful getaway. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19a2744d-cf16-4619-bdf2-6462459161c0\">In this second season</a>, a (mostly) new line-up of egregious narcissists check in at a five-star Sicilian retreat. Some of them, however, might not be returning home. Not only is the setting even more resplendent this time, Mike White's writing and characterisations seem to get richer with every episode. The exquisite theme music — part opera, part delirious club anthem — perfectly sets the tone for a show that boasts artful execution and a playful spirit. &#xa0;</p> <p><em>On NOW in the UK and HBO Max in the US</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Best TV shows of 2022' FT.com 19 December.
