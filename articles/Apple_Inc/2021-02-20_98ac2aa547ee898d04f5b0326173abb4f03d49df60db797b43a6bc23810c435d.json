  "title": "Roksanda Ilincic: ‘I always had an urge to communicate through clothing'",
  "text": "<p><strong>Roksanda Ilincic, 45, founded the Roksanda fashion label in 2005. Her many accolades include the 2012 Red Carpet Award at the British Fashion Awards and her work has been displayed in the Design Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2018 she was created Knight of the Saint Sava Order of Diplomatic Pacifism, the Serbian equivalent of a damehood. </strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition? </strong><br>To be a fashion designer. There was always an urge to communicate through clothing. I customised my navy school uniform with huge red buttons. </p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work? </strong><br>I come from ex-Yugoslavia, which only had state schooling. Everybody was treated as equal. That's something that's very fundamental to me. I don't like it when people are judged by their social status or where they come from. I enrolled at two universities in Belgrade, one for architecture, one for applied arts. There weren't many jobs connected to fashion at the time, you certainly couldn't start your own label, so I found my alternative in architecture. I did my master's in London at Central Saint Martins University of the Arts. </p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor? </strong><br>My mum had a huge influence. Thanks to her, I was exposed to fashion from an early age, and she supported me in all my decisions. Professor Louise Wilson at CSM was&#xa0;another colossal figure in my life. She was almost my mum here in London, taking care of me, advising me, teaching me what fashion really is. </p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you? </strong><br>I'm passionate about Pilates — I do it religiously twice a week. But I wouldn't say I'm amazingly fit. A&#xa0;fashion designer's working day is very long and the run-ups to the shows are very demanding. </p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success? </strong><br>A good balance of both. Talent is the&#xa0;foundation but ambition will propel talent further. The most important ingredient is to be in the right place at the right time, surrounded by the right people. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you? </strong><br>We live in times where you have to be politically involved in some way. The environment is something that each of us has to fight for, as governments are not moving quickly enough. And equality, not just economic, but cultural. Many things in our society are&#xa0;unbalanced. </p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess? </strong><br>Time to enjoy the moment rather than planning the future. </p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance? </strong><br>Extending the precious, treasured&#xa0;moments spent with friends and family. </p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest? </strong><br>Any place, as long as I am with my&#xa0;family. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have? </strong><br>To be present with meaning, and leave a body of work that has inspiration, a message, and leads to positive change. Longevity is a big mountain — not just in fashion, but in everything.</p> <p><strong>What drives you on? </strong><br>Making positive change and inspiring people with my work. I&#xa0;want to put a spotlight on female creatives that are not as known as their male counterparts. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far? </strong><br>My daughter. No work achievement can match being a mother. </p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>When people are judgmental — when they are not aware of their own weaknesses, but are very quick to judge others. Selfishness, self-obsession. We are here on this planet to help each other. </p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would she think? </strong><br>That's when I was studying everything and dreaming big. She would be happy, because she'd see many of those dreams fulfilled. </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had? </strong><br>I am so good with keeping precious things and I always know where they are — I'm very particular!</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>Climate change. And building a society that isn't based purely on economic principles but based on the good of the people who live in it. </p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife? </strong><br>I do believe in some bigger power and energy, but I'm not sure I believe in an afterlife. </p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score? </strong><br>It varies day to day. I don't think I could rate it but I'd like to quote my mum: “You have to embrace and enjoy every moment of your life, whether it's good or bad, as it's there for a reason.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://roksanda.com/\">roksanda.com</a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
