  "text": "<p>Wine prices may be rising but so is quality — and I sincerely believe in all the wines below, whatever their cost. Many retailers offer discounts on these single-bottle price below. I have also recommended a couple of superior wines offered in bag-in-box packages. Wines are listed in ascending price per cl.</p> <p><strong>AA Badenhorst, The Curator 2020 Coastal Region 13%<br></strong>Adi Badenhorst delivers value even at full price. This drink-me blend of 51% Chenin Blanc, 22% Chardonnay, 22% Viognier plus a little Semillon and Colombard is satin-smooth.<br><em>£6.74 (reduced from £8.99 in December) Waitrose</em></p> <p><strong>Domaine Huber Grüner Veltliner 2020 Traisental 12.5%<br></strong>Very agreeable, if not exactly intense, introduction to Austria's medium-bodied, refreshing signature grape. Great price.<br><em>£7.78 (reduced from £10.79 for December) Waitrose</em></p> <p><strong>Villiera Sauvignon Blanc 2020 Stellenbosch 13%<br></strong>South Africa is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8092a76e-b6d0-4749-8918-8bb4e634fed6\">good source of value</a>. This wine is appetisingly dry with real character. For drinking with or without food, though whoosh it around a bit to aerate it. <br><em>£8 M&amp;S</em></p> <p><strong>De Grendel Sauvignon Blanc 2020 Cape Town 13.5%<br></strong>You can almost feel the wind off the ocean in this subtle dry wine with top notes of green fruits and vegetation. Great value at the promotional price.<br><em>£8.99 (reduced from £11.99 in December) Waitrose</em></p> <p><strong>Vergelegen Sauvignon Blanc 2020 Stellenbosch 13.5%<br></strong>Another Cape answer to Marlborough that's agreeably dry and full of flavour. Drink now. <br><em>£10 Tesco</em></p> <p><strong>Corte Mainente, Vigna Cengelle 2020 Soave 12.5%<br></strong>From a producer keen to build sales in the UK, hence the extremely friendly price. Compelling evidence of the revolution in quality in Soave. <br><em>£10.95 Stone, Vine &amp; Sun</em></p> <p><strong>Blütenreich Riesling 2020 Niederösterreich 12.5%</strong> <br>Organic methods in the vineyard. Very fine and very Austrian with rather more spice and body than the average German Riesling. Great value.<br><em>£10.99 MJ Wine Cellars</em></p> <p><strong>Ciu Ciu, Oris 2020 Falerio 13%</strong> <br>From the Marche, on Italy's east coast. Certified organic. Edge of green apples but quite enough ripe fruit and interest. Excellent balance and drive.<br><em>£11.90 The Sourcing Table</em></p> <p><strong>Luigi Baudana, Dragon 2020 Langhe 13.0%</strong> <br>Blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc with the local Nascetta and a little Riesling from an estate owned by the Vajra family of Barolo. An array of flavours with floral and green fruit notes. Long and vibrant. A proper wine for the money.<br><em>£11.95 The Wine Society</em></p> <p><strong>Encostas da Pedra Alta 2019 Douro Branco 12.5%<br></strong>Part barrel-fermented, wild yeast Douro blend. Chock full of tangy character and still youthful and vibrant at two years old. Really tense and glorious.<br><em>£38.50 for a 2.25l bag in box (equiv. £12.83 a bottle) The BIB Wine Co</em></p> <p><strong>TR Wines Dry Furmint 2020 Upper Hungary 13</strong>%<br>From a single plot in the village of Tallya near <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c24c2f2-4d2a-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\">Tokaj</a>. Light nose of baked apples and excellent structure. Recognisably Dry Furmint with a bit of apple skin chewiness. Really interesting.<br><em>£39 for a 2.25l bag in box (equiv. £13 a bottle) The BIB Wine Co</em></p> <p><strong>Pazo da Maga 2020 Ribeira Sacra 13%</strong><br>Brilliant value from the steep slopes of the Sil valley in north-west Spain, where viticulture is described as “heroic”. Made from the great Godello grape.<br><em>£14.95 Lea &amp; Sandeman</em></p> <p><strong>Autòcton Xarel-lo 2019 Spain 12.5%<br></strong>The Catalan Xarel-lo grape can make sophisticated dry whites such as this one made from elderly, certified organic vines at an old winery south of Barcelona.<br><em>£15.50 Lea &amp; Sandeman</em></p> <p><strong>Sybille Kuntz Riesling trocken 2020 Mosel 12%<br></strong>Truly beautiful dry Riesling from a steep, biodynamically tended vineyard. Intense but not heavy. Great to drink with spicy food.<br><em>£15.99 to £23.99 De Burgh, Vino Vero, Highbury Vintners, Uncharted, Noble Fine Liquor, Tivoli Wines</em></p> <p><strong>Kyrenia 2020 Patras 12%<br></strong>A wine from the northern Peloponnese from Roditis grapes. Light nose of dried leaves but excellent grip on the palate without much alcohol.<br><em>£16 The Sourcing Table</em></p> <p><strong>AA Badenhorst, Secateurs Riviera 2020 Swartland 13%</strong><br>A (very pale) orange wine made from 75% Chenin Blanc and 25% Grenache Blanc. This would be a great introduction to grippy skin‑contact white.<br><em>£16.90 The Sourcing Table</em></p> <p><strong>Quinta da Silveira Branco 2017 Douro 12.5%<br></strong>Dry whites from the port valley in northern Portugal are some of the most interesting wines in the world. This one is usefully mature.<br><em>£16.95 Davy's Wine Merchants</em></p> <p><strong>Inama, Vigneti di Foscarino 2018 Soave 13%<br></strong>Soave can be every bit as good as a fine white burgundy. This 2018 lasts for ever on the palate and it's a steal at the reduced price.<br><em>£16.99 (reduced from £19.99 in December) Waitrose</em></p> <p><strong>Terrazas de los Andes Chardonnay 2018 Mendoza 14%<br></strong>Sourced from a range of vineyards in the Andes. Impressively persistent. Great natural freshness and obviously ripe fruit, though the smokiness distracts successfully from this.<br><em>£16.99 Majestic (just £11.99 if any six bottles are bought)</em></p> <p><strong>Planeta, Eruzione 1614 2018 Sicilia 12.5%<br></strong>Carricante vines are planted at 800m on volcanic soils. Nutty lime flavours and light chewiness. Amazing texture.<br><em>£18.50 The Wine Society</em></p> <p><strong>Ch Grand Village 2019 Bordeaux Blanc 13.5%<br></strong>Super-precise dry white from the owners of Ch Lafleur in Pomerol that's almost more like white burgundy than white bordeaux.<br><em>£18.67 Justerini &amp; Brooks</em></p> <p><strong>Ch Suduiraut, Le Blanc Sec de Suduiraut 2020 Bordeaux 13.5%<br></strong>Sauvignon-stinky on the nose, then rich and broad on the palate. Creamy texture and lovely perfume.<br><em>£19.50 Cambridge Wine Merchants, also Bottles Wine Bar and Merchants</em> </p> <p><strong>Les Héritiers du Comte Lafon, Les Maranches 2018 Mâcon-Uchizy 13%<br></strong>The southern outpost of Dominique Lafon of Meursault produces reliably good-value white burgundy. This is much racier — less plump — than most white Mâcons.<br><em>£22.48 Lay &amp; Wheeler</em></p> <p><strong>Jean-Marc Brocard, Vau de Vey Premier Cru 2019 Chablis 13.5%<br></strong>Steely, minerally nose from a consistent producer. The wet stones, super-fluid aroma of Chablis comes soaring out the bottle.<br><em>£22.50 The Wine Society</em></p> <p><strong>Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2021 Marlborough 13.3%<br></strong>The latest vintage of this world‑famous wine is particularly successful. It's no bargain but it is reliably good.<br><em>£23 to £27 Amathus, Frazier's, Fareham Wine Cellar, Hedonism, Cambridge Wine Merchants, Majestic, Laithwaites and others</em></p> <p><strong>Domaine Mann, Riesling Altengarten 2018 Alsace 13.5%</strong> <br>This biodynamically grown wine was my favourite at a recent tasting of this retailer's current range. Great value. <br><em>£25 The Sourcing Table</em></p> <p><strong>Rall White 2020 Coastal Region 13%<br></strong>Donovan Rall is a superstar of the South African new wave and his super-tense, eminently ageworthy red and white blends are arguably his best-value wines.<br><em>£25.68 Justerini &amp; Brooks</em></p> <p><strong>Finca Allende Blanco 2016 Rioja 13.5%<br></strong>My favourite white rioja by miles. A complex, waxy dry white that can stand up to a wide range of foods. <br><em>£26.95 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, £26.99 Bancroft Wines</em></p> <p><strong>Keller, Von Der Fels Riesling trocken 2018 Rheinhessen 12.5%<br></strong>Klaus Peter Keller's more famous bone-dry Rieslings now cost three-digit sums per bottle, but this is almost as good. Thrilling.<br><em>£28.50 Streatham Wine House</em></p> <p><strong>Grosset, Polish Hill Riesling 2020 Clare Valley 12.8%<br></strong>Australia's most famous dry Riesling — a modern classic. A bottle of the 2001 opened recently was as fresh as a daisy — vindication of the screwcaps advocated by Jeffrey Grosset so long ago.<br><em>£34.99 to £41 Rannoch Scott, Oz Wines, Vinoteca, Butler's Wine Cellar, NY Wines, Bottle Apostle</em></p> <p><strong>Dom Jean Monnier 2019 Puligny-Montrachet<br></strong>Classic savoury white burgundy, with notes of lemon, lime and oak-induced structure that is usefully accessible already.<br><em>£39 Laithwaites</em></p> <p><strong>Bodega Chacra, Mainqué Chardonnay 2019 Patagonia 12%<br></strong>Southern Argentine Chardonnay made under the guiding hand of cult winemaker Jean-Marc Roulot. It shows. Roulot's basic Bourgogne would cost far more. So good.<br><em>£39.50 Lea &amp; Sandeman</em></p> <p><strong>Kershaw, Clonal Selection Chardonnay 2017 Elgin 13.5%<br></strong>Such precision from a British Master of Wine who is now spinning gold from one of South Africa's coolest corners.<br><em>£41.99 Handford</em> </p> <p><strong>David &amp; Nadia, Hoë-Steen Chenin Blanc 2020 Swartland 13%<br></strong>Gloriously pure South African answer to Puligny-Montrachet made from old vines. <br><em>£51.68 Justerini &amp; Brooks</em></p> <p><strong>Dom Bruno Colin, Les Chaumées Premier Cru 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet<br></strong>Creamy, with a hint of a white Pessac-Léognan. Crisp and chiselled but with masses of fruit intensity on the mid palate. Fun! <br><em>£69 Four Walls, Old Bridge and other independents</em></p> <p><em>Tasting notes on Purple Pages of </em><a href=\"https://www.jancisrobinson.com/\"><em>JancisRobinson.com</em></a><em>.
