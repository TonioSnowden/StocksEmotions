  "title": "Apple Warns on iPhone Shipments",
  "text": "<p>\"We now expect lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products,\" the company said.</p><p>Also Sunday, Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group said it is revising down its outlook for the fourth quarter due to the pandemic's impact on operations at its Zhengzhou site in central China, the world's biggest assembly site for iPhones. The company entered a weeklong lockdown at its Zhengzhou complex after battling a Covid-19 outbreak that lasted several weeks.</p><p>Foxconn attempted to create a closed-loop system to stop the spread of Covid-19, largely shutting off huge numbers of workers from the outside world and confining them to their homes and specific parts of the factory. Some refused to return to the factory, worried about the spread of the disease. Some workers escaped from the site.</p><p>The Zhengzhou facility would normally produce more than 80% of the iPhone 14 base models and 85% of the high-end Pro models, according to Counterpoint Research.</p><p>On Sunday, Apple said it continued to see strong demand for the high-end iPhones and that it was making the health and safety of the workers in its supply chain a priority. \"We are working closely with our supplier to return to normal production levels while ensuring the health and safety of every worker,\" Apple said.</p><p>On its website, Foxconn said it is working with the government \"in concerted efforts to stamp out the pandemic and resume production to its full capacity as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>The disruption could rank as the biggest Covid-era blow to Apple, which has been mostly able to navigate around the kinds of punishing supply-chain disruptions that have crippled rivals and other industries.</p><p>The iPhone company has churned out record profits due to iPhone sales during the past two years, helping fuel investor enthusiasm and pushing the company's stock to new highs, though those gains have retreated in recent months.</p>",
