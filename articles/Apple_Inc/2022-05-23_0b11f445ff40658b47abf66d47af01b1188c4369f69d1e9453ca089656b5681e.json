  "text": "<p>   I am a longtime member of the Museum of Jewish Heritage and my family and I have visited and supported the museum throughout the years. I am very disappointed at the museum's decision to not allow Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to talk at the planned Tikvah Fund conference. I read the letter (May 10) by Jack Kliger, the museum's CEO, that provides a logistical rationale for not allowing this event to proceed. But it is hard for me to believe that the decision would have been the same if someone with liberal political views had been asked to speak at this conference. It is ironic that a museum that teaches tolerance should not tolerate having Mr. DeSantis speak. </p><p>   Martin Hoffman </p><p>    East Brunswick, N.J. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    I cannot fathom why cultural institutions and the Fortune 500 can't simply stick to their knitting, which should never include gratuitous woke cant. Museum benefactors and corporate shareholders should vote their wallets: Deny these places money, their lifeblood, until they're ready to eschew the unnecessary, unwanted and unwelcome politics. </p><p>   Bill Apple </p><p>    New York </p><p></p>",
