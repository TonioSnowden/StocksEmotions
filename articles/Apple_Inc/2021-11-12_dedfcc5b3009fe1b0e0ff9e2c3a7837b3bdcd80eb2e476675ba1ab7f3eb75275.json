  "text": "<p>A group of ginkgoes survived the explosion of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. All were within the burn zone and were exposed to extensive radiation, rain blackened by ash and contaminated soil. Although their bark was charred, the ginkgoes' internal phloem cells regenerated and they blossomed the following spring. The trees are alive today, marked by plaques acknowledging their fortitude.</p><p>But with all due respect, ginkgos stink. Though the male tree doesn't bear fruit, the female's pulpy yellow pods emit a foul smell that evokes a locker-room hamper. One gardening writer described it as \"akin to vomit or rancid butter.\" The pods contain butyric acid, a fatty acid found in butter and also used in dietary supplements to treat stomach disorders. Some scientists think the rank smell appealed to herbivorous dinosaurs, which devoured the fruit and helped propagate the trees by passing the seeds, eons before the ginkgo was first cultivated in China.</p><p>Around 10% of Manhattan's trees are ginkgoes -- they line city streets and are especially plentiful in Central Park. Their fan-shaped leaves are lovely, but in case the stench isn't enough to knock you over, the fallen fruit rots into a mushy paste that sticks to your shoes and is a slip-and-fall hazard.</p><p>Amazingly, some chefs regard the cherry-sized nuts inside the fruit as a delicacy. Asian men and women gather in the park with latex gloves, buckets and supermarket grabbers to yank nuts from branches. I've seen families use ladders and coolers to harvest them. The smell supposedly fades when they are cooked, but I'm not angling for invitations to come over for ginkgo stew or dumplings.</p><p>My dog is a ginkgo fan, which adds to the challenge of walking in the park this time of year. I try to keep his snout elevated as we slog through one mashed minefield to the next, yet he often manages to snatch a nut or two, and they miraculously pass through his system whole.</p><p>I'm trying to keep the ginkgoes in perspective this year. Consider all those who lost their sense of smell from Covid. I wouldn't trade places even if it let me breathe freely as I pass foul-smelling pod piles. Every fruit has its day, and even an apple orchard turns putrid by season's end. By the time the ginkgo gunk is gone, winter has arrived. That really stinks.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Ripp runs a press relations firm in New York.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
