  "text": "<p>Read live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky recorded a video address from the street outside the presidential headquarters in Kyiv, urging Ukrainians to keep fighting and denying Russian reports that he had called on his forces to lay down arms.</p><p>\"Truth is on our side. This is our land, our country, our children, and we will keep defending them all,\" he said. \"Glory to Ukraine.\"</p><p>A rapid Russian victory in the biggest war in Europe for decades would drastically change the geopolitical balance on the continent, giving Mr. Putin control of strategically vital swaths of the former Soviet Union's territory and placing Russia's armies on the doorstep of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p><p>European and U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that Mr. Putin's broader goal of revising the ending of the Cold War, restoring Moscow's former sphere of influence in Europe's east, won't stop at Ukraine, a fear that could force a rethink of NATO's military stance and Europe's energy supplies, which depend in large part on Russia. Mr. Zelensky has constantly reinforced that message, saying that Ukrainians are fighting and dying not just for their own country but for all of Europe.</p><p>If fierce Ukrainian resistance leads to a long and bloody war—or forces Mr. Putin to seek a peace deal without achieving his goals—the setback could threaten both his hold on power in Moscow and his drive to restore Russia as a global power.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, in an address on Saturday, said that Russia has failed in its quest to quickly replace him with a puppet regime and that Ukrainian soldiers were holding the line throughout the country. He called on Ukrainians abroad and foreign volunteers to join the fight. \"Everyone who can, come back to defend Ukraine,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"All the friends of Ukraine who want to come join us, come here too—we will give you weapons.\"</p><p>On Friday, the biggest thrust of Russian forces, pouring in from the north, targeted Kyiv, an ancient city that was home to around three million people before Russian bombardments triggered a mass exodus of people toward western Ukraine, which is safer. Many who remained in the city spent the night in bomb shelters and underground subway stations.</p><p>Ukrainian civilians fleeing westward have been stuck in long lines of cars near the border with Poland. Many people have abandoned their cars and walked to the border for many hours in chilly weather, carrying children and a few belongings.</p><p>Ukraine's Health Ministry said Saturday that 198 Ukrainian civilians, including three children, had been killed since the Russian invasion began, and 1,115 injured.</p><p>\"We knew that the night would be difficult because the Russian Federation would use all its resources and reserves to inflict on us maximum damage in the maximum number of locations,\" Mr. Zelensky's adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said at a 7 a.m. briefing on Saturday. \"Kyiv is their priority number one because the main declared goal of the Russian operation is the annihilation of Ukraine's political and military leadership. That is why they are pouring the maximum number of Russian troops toward Kyiv.\"</p><p>A Russian column that attempted to advance from the West, on the highway linking Kyiv to Lviv, was destroyed in nighttime fighting inside Kyiv. Bodies lay on the ground, amid the smoldering remains of armored vehicles and trucks. Presumed Russian infiltrators, traveling in civilian vehicles, were also gunned down by Ukrainian troops as they tried to approach the Ukrainian Parliament building, witnesses said. Intense firefights were reported in other locations throughout the capital.</p><p>After daybreak on Saturday, Ukrainian regular troops and volunteers of the newly formed Territorial Defense force regained the upper hand, erecting roadblocks, firing positions and other fortifications around the city, particularly in the government district and near bridges spanning the Dnipro river. Trucks accompanied by police ferried ammunition as civilians lined up patiently in grocery stores, at pharmacies and teller machines.</p><p>A large supermarket on Kyiv's Antonovycha street was well stocked, with fresh bread, pineapples and Italian cheese, and some of the checkout lanes still accepted Apple Pay. A handful of basement bars reopened as makeshift shelters, serving espressos before the 5 p.m. curfew kicked in. At one bar, customers were asked to show their passports to prove that they were not Russian citizens.</p><p>The biggest lines in the Ukrainian capital were at the recruitment centers for the Territorial Defense. At one sports facility converted for this purpose, several hundred volunteers, commanded by career military officers, loaded crates of ammunition into civilian vehicles and sped off to their positions.</p><p>Outside, hundreds more aspiring recruits, including women, patiently waited their turn in a line that snaked around the building. \"I never expected so many would turn up. The whole city has risen up now,\" one of the officers at the site said. \"A bit too late, but better late than never.\"</p><p>Concerned about Russian infiltrators and spies, members of the Territorial Defense didn't allow photography and didn't provide their names. The volunteers said they had no choice but to fight now that Russian forces were on Kyiv's doorstep.</p><p>\"A Russian rocket hit a building near my home this morning. This was the last straw for me, and now it's time to take up arms. Everyone in this city who wanted to escape has already fled,\" said one of the new recruits, a 35-year-old IT specialist.</p><p>\"There is nowhere to run and no point in hiding. We just have to repel the invaders and send them back where they came from,\" said another, a human-resources specialist.</p><p>South of Kyiv, Russian airborne troops attempted a landing in the strategic town of Vasylkiv, the location of a Ukrainian military airfield. Firefights broke out during the night but by morning hundreds of Ukrainian troops and irregular volunteers armed with assault rifles patrolled Vasylkiv's main road. Along the highway running between Kyiv and Odessa near Vasylkiv, security forces and local volunteers wearing armbands were looking for stray Russian troops who might be hiding in the woods.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers said they had driven off most of the Russian landing force in Vasylkiv. Kyiv also said Ukrainian forces had downed a Russian Il-76 transport plane full of airborne troops near Vasylkiv. That claim couldn't be independently confirmed. In the late morning, contrails of two jet fighters engaging in a dogfight could be seen in the blue skies above the town.</p><p>Intense fighting also went on through the night near the southern cities of Odessa, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Mariupol, Mr. Podolyak said.</p><p>On Friday, Moscow signaled an openness to talks with Kyiv. But shortly after, Mr. Putin excoriated Mr. Zelensky, calling him a terrorist and urging Ukraine's military to oust him, dimming prospects for diplomacy.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky is expected to speak to several world leaders later on Saturday, Mr. Podolyak said. On Friday, Mr. Zelensky spoke by phone with President Biden. A White House official said the call lasted about 40 minutes.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky wrote on Twitter, \"Strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an antiwar coalition have just been discussed with @POTUS.\"</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that Washington would provide up to $350 million in additional military aid to Ukraine, including \"lethal defensive assistance\" to help Kyiv resist Russian armored and airborne forces.</p><p>Mr. Blinken didn't say which weapons Washington intended to provide. The U.S. has previously sent Javelin antitank weapons and ammunition, among other battlefield systems. In January, the U.S. also gave approval for Latvia and Lithuania to deliver American-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles to Kyiv.</p><p>Mr. Biden authorized the fresh delivery of military aid Friday night and approved up to $250 for overall assistance to Ukraine. A person familiar with the matter said the administration has asked Congress for $6.4 billion in additional funding for Ukraine aid and defense needs.</p><p>Michael R.
