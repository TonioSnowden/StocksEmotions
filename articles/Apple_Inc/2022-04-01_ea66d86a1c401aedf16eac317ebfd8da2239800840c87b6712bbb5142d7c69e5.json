  "text": "<p>   WATSONVILLE, Calif. -- A group of investors bought this small city's only hospital in late 2019. To pay for the deal, its buildings and land were sold to one of the country's largest owners of medical properties. Two years later the hospital went bankrupt. </p><p>   The Watsonville Community Hospital has served the largely Latino farming region of strawberry fields and apple orchards for more than a century. Now, the community is trying to raise as much as $70 million to buy the hospital and save it from closure. </p><p>   \"It would be a disaster,\" said John Martinelli, chairman of S. Martinelli &amp; Co., a family-owned producer of apple juice and sparkling cider, based in Watsonville. </p><p>   Across the U.S., hospital real-estate deals like the one in Watsonville have surged, leaving the facilities paying rent on property they once owned. Many such buyouts are being financed by Medical Properties Trust Inc. Even before these deals, called sale-leasebacks, some hospitals in small cities were struggling financially because they often served relatively poor populations. </p><p>   The deals have made MPT one of the biggest owners of U.S. hospital real estate, with hundreds of properties around the country and more than $20 billion of assets. The Birmingham, Ala., company's strategy attracted many investors, who fueled MPT's growth by buying its stock and bonds. </p><p>   The deals at times also have enabled private-equity giants to fund large payouts to their investors by tapping hospitals' real-estate equity. In other situations, the hefty financing that MPT offered drew in lesser-known investors like the group that bought the Watsonville hospital. By acquiring hospitals with MPT's money, some investors have been able to avoid putting up much of their own cash. If the deal goes bad, the losses fall on the hospital and MPT. </p><p>   In a written response to questions for this article, MPT said its financial support likely prevented the Watsonville hospital from closing at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company said it had committed $25 million of financing to help the hospital through bankruptcy and agreed to cut the hospital's rent by roughly 25% in the proposed deal to sell it to a local nonprofit. </p><p>   \"MPT has taken extraordinary steps to help preserve the Watsonville Community Hospital's ongoing operations and long-term viability as an integral part of the community,\" it said. </p><p>   Some former MPT employees familiar with the company's deal making said MPT took significant risks in pursuit of rapid growth in recent years. The Watsonville hospital appeared likely to default on its lease payments from the time MPT acquired it, one of these people said. The hospital lost money before the 2019 deal, and the lease added millions of dollars a year in financial obligations that it would have to pay. </p><p>   MPT said that its investments are based on extensive underwriting and that its results in recent years demonstrate the success of its strategy. </p><p>   The expansion push benefited MPT executives, whose compensation in recent years was partly linked to the volume of acquisitions completed by the company and other growth metrics. This has drawn attention from investors, including some who are betting against the company's shares. They believe the incentives could push executives into overly aggressive deal making. </p><p>   MPT said its compensation plan includes provisions that would reduce executive compensation if deals don't create value on a per-share basis. \"MPT does not reward any executive for simply growing the business,\" it said. </p><p>   If MPT's hospital investments falter, the Watsonville case shows how governments at times can be forced to step in to provide large sums of money to keep them from closing. </p><p>   In Watsonville, a small group of local volunteers has been working to drum up support and money in the state Capitol and around the region to save the hospital. \"This is the most urgent thing that's facing our region right now,\" said state Sen. John Laird, a Democrat involved in the effort to save the hospital. </p><p>   Located just outside of Watsonville's downtown off California's Highway 1, the hospital serves an area of around 140,000 people and offers the only emergency room within a half-hour drive, bankruptcy filings say. It receives more than 20,000 emergency visits annually. </p><p>   Watsonville is just an hour by car from Palo Alto, but it is far removed from Silicon Valley's tech riches. The overwhelming majority of its population is Latino, and its median household income is estimated at roughly $61,000, about $3,500 less than the national median. Building murals in downtown Watsonville depict its agricultural and Latino heritage. </p><p>   Many residents work for the berry company Driscoll's Inc., which is also headquartered in Watsonville. Driscoll's Chief Executive J. Miles Reiter is among the business leaders supporting the efforts to save the hospital from closure. </p><p>   Founded in 1895 as a five-room medical center, the Watsonville hospital was a nonprofit for most of its history. The San Francisco earthquake of 1989 severely damaged the hospital, which in turn contributed to financial stresses over the following decade. </p><p>   In 1998, it was sold to Tennessee-based for-profit hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. Over time, CHS reduced services at the hospital, such as treating cancer. </p><p>   CHS spun out the Watsonville hospital into a new company called Quorum Health Corp. in 2016. That company struggled with a hefty debt load and eventually went bankrupt. </p><p>   Amid its financial troubles, Quorum sold the Watsonville hospital's operations to Halsen Healthcare. Halsen was led by a former hospital executive from Orange County named Daniel Brothman, court filings and corporate records show. He had been chief operating officer at a financially challenged hospital company called Integrated Healthcare Holdings Inc. </p><p>   When people in Watsonville searched for information about Mr. Brothman, they read about a bitter, decadelong legal dispute between Integrated Healthcare and a doctor who had expressed concerns about the company's finances. That doctor had been arrested when police found a handgun in his car, and he alleged the company was responsible for putting it there. A jury awarded the doctor more than $5 million in damages. </p><p>   Integrated Healthcare contended at the time that the jury erred in its decision. The damages awarded to the doctor were later upheld by a state appeals court. </p><p>   Alarmed by the possible acquirer, healthcare workers and others in Watsonville took part in a town-hall meeting to discuss the Halsen sale. \"You guys have dug yourself a big hole in this community. People know who you are,\" a longtime local family doctor named Joe Gallagher recalled telling Mr. Brothman. </p><p>   Mr. Brothman didn't comment on this. In a text message, he said the Watsonville hospital's troubles were a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that hit a few months after Halsen acquired it. </p><p>   A local nonprofit called the Community Health Trust of Pajaro Valley tried to block the hospital takeover. But the effort ultimately failed to match the MPT-financed offer by Halsen. </p><p>   In all, Quorum said it got $46 million for selling the hospital. MPT put up $40 million for the hospital's property and issued Halsen a $15 million loan to fund its operations, according to MPT filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p><p>   A local family-practice doctor, Christopher O'Grady, recalled that shortly after the deal closed, Mr. Brothman told him of how Halsen had acquired the hospital without spending its own money. </p><p>   \"It sounded like more of a gamble, that they were playing with house money,\" Dr. O'Grady said. Mr. Brothman didn't comment on this. </p><p>   MPT said it provided financing to Halsen because it believed the hospital's operations and services could be strengthened under the right management and contribute to the community. </p><p>   Losses ballooned at the hospital. Operational issues included a faulty billing system that made it difficult to collect revenues, according to a bankruptcy filing. </p><p>   Things got worse after Covid-19 hit. Six months after Halsen acquired it, MPT said the hospital was in default for failing to pay its rent, a bankruptcy filing shows. </p><p>   At the time of its bankruptcy in December, the hospital had lost over $32 million that year, according to a bankruptcy filing. By comparison, Quorum said it lost around $10 million on the hospital in 2019 before selling it. </p><p>   As losses mounted, MPT sent the hospital millions of dollars of emergency funding, increasing the hospital's obligations to the landlord, bankruptcy filings show. MPT had provided money to its tenants previously after they ran into financial challenges. After the hospital defaulted, MPT exercised its right to remove Halsen, which was replaced with a new operator. </p><p>   MPT said it provided this money even though it wasn't sure whether it would be repaid because it believed that keeping the hospital open was the \"right thing to do for the community.\" </p><p>   When it filed for bankruptcy in December, the Watsonville hospital owed MPT more than $40 million, court filings show, in addition to tens of millions of dollars more in lease obligations. </p><p>   At the time of the bankruptcy, a representative for the hospital said in a court filing that without the company's financial support, it would have been forced to immediately close. </p><p>   Mimi Hall, a former local health official who opposed Halsen's takeover bid two years earlier, teamed up with local nonprofit groups to try to buy the hospital. \"I don't want to see the slow dissolution of our healthcare system here,\" she said. </p><p>   In a court filing, Ms. Hall said the \"above market\" lease payments to MPT were partly the cause of its financial woes. As of October, according to a bankruptcy filing, the hospital was paying MPT $353,000 in monthly rent, and hundreds of thousands more in interest on debts. </p><p>   MPT said the lease rate was appropriate \"given the risk profile of the hospital.\" </p><p></p>",
