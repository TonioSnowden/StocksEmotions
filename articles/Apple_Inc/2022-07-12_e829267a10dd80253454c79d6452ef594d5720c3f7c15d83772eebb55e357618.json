  "text": "<p>HBO's \"Succession,\" which led all series with 25 total nominations, returned to the competition for best drama series. The 2020 winner had spent a year on the Emmy sidelines due to pandemic delays.</p><p>The stylishly disturbing workplace drama \"Severance\" earned Apple TV+ its first nomination for best drama series, following its first big Emmy win last year for \"Ted Lasso.\"</p><p>With \"Yellowjackets,\" a sleeper hit about the fallout after a plane carrying a girls soccer team crash lands, Showtime landed its first nomination for best drama since \"Homeland\" in 2016.</p><p>With the best drama nomination for \"Euphoria,\" 25-year-old star and executive producer Zendaya becomes the youngest woman to be Emmy-nominated for producing. Last year she marked another first as the youngest lead actress drama winner, and is now nominated for that award again.</p><p>Also in the running for best drama series are repeat nominees \"Better Call Saul\" (AMC), \"Ozark\" (Netflix) and \"Stranger Things\" (Netflix).</p><p>\"Ted Lasso,\" which dominated the comedy categories last year, was a runner-up in total nominations with 20. This time, the Apple TV+ series will compete for outstanding comedy series with a past winner (Amazon's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), past nominees (HBO's \"Barry\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" FX's \"What We Do In the Shadows,\" HBO Max's \"Hacks\") and first-timers (Hulu's \"Only Murders In the Building\", ABC's \"Abbott Elementary\").</p><p>The \"Abbott Elementary\" nod allowed a broadcast network to maintain a toehold in the scripted series-level categories long dominated by cable networks and streamers.</p><p>\"The White Lotus,\" HBO's conversation-starter from last summer, tied \"Ted Lasso\" with 20 total nominations. The show about privileged people in paradise is in the running for best limited seriesâ€”even though it is returning for a second installment in a different setting. \"The White Lotus\" is up against Hulu's \"Dopesick,\" \"The Dropout,\" and \"Pam &amp; Tommy,\" and Netflix's \"Inventing Anna.\"</p><p>As always with the Emmys, popularity didn't necessarily translate into prestige. The cowboy melodrama \"Yellowstone,\"the biggest scripted show on cable and the source of multiple spinoff series, failed to lasso any nominations for Paramount or series stars such as Kevin Costner and Kelly Reilly. The hit prequel series \"1883,\" starring Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, was also shut out of high-profile categories.</p><p>\"Succession,\" a saga of cutthroat family rivalry, generated head-to-head competition in the acting categories. For lead actor in a drama, Brian Cox will vie with past winner Jeremy Strong. The supporting actor race pits Nicholas Braun, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen against each other. Sarah Snook and J. Smith-Cameron were both nominated for supporting actress.</p><p>Departed shows earned a shot at an Emmy victory lap. Nominees for \"Ozark,\" which recently went out with a bang after four seasons on Netflix, included Laura Linney and Jason Bateman. \"Killing Eve\" stars Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh will face off in the best drama actress category.</p><p>Some of TV's most decorated shows were absent from the nominations, including \"The Boys,\"\"The Handmaid's Tale,\" and \"Westworld,\" because they didn't air within the eligibility period of June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022.</p><p>That list of missing shows includes heavy hitter \"The Crown,\" which swept all seven drama awards last year for its fourth season, and got Netflix its first-ever drama series win. If the show returns for Season 5 later this year as expected, it would be eligible for the 2023 Emmys.</p><p>The TV industry's increasingly common practice of splitting seasons also affected the field.</p><p>This effectively gives \"Better Call Saul\" two shots at winning for its finale season. The show was nominated for the season's first seven episodes, which started rolling out in April. The show's final batch of five episodes, which started this week, will be eligible for next year's Emmys.</p><p>The latest season of \"Stranger Things,\" too, straddled the eligibility window.</p><p>Among other perceived snubs: \"Only Murders In the Building\" star Selena Gomez missed out on an acting nod, unlike her two co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short. The finale seasons for ABC's \"Black-ish\" and NBC's \"This Is Us\" received no major nominations despite the shows' history of competing for series-level awards.</p><p>The 74th Primetime Emmy Awards are scheduled to air Sept. 12 on NBC.</p><p>Emmys Nominations 2022: 'Squid Game' Makes History</p>",
