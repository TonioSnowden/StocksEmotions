  "title": "FirstFT: US plans to sell carbon credits to companies",
  "text": "<p>The US is working on a plan to harness cash from the world's largest companies to help developing countries cut their use of fossil fuels, an idea it aims to unveil at the UN climate summit this week.</p> <p>Joe Biden's climate envoy John Kerry is trying to marshal support from other governments, companies and climate experts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf064250-e4ce-48c2-a4dd-dc96bc7660e2\">to develop a framework</a> for carbon credits to be sold to business. The proceeds could then fund new clean energy projects.</p> <p>Under the plans, regional governments or state bodies would earn carbon credits by reducing their power sector's emissions as fossil fuel infrastructure, such as coal-fired plants, were cut and renewable energy increased.</p> <p>The credits would be certified by an independent, as-yet unspecified, accreditation body. Companies would then be able to buy the credits to offset their own carbon emissions.</p> <p>Plans for the US scheme emerged as the COP27 climate summit opened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It was marked by a new warning from the World Meteorological Organisation that the past eight years <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c623fe2d-9399-4fb4-85ae-1cb2fdcf857c\">were on track to be the warmest on record</a>.</p> <p>The WMO's state of the climate annual report said the global average temperature in 2022 was around 1.15C higher than pre-industrial levels which means the world is still on track for at least 2.4C of warming — well above the 2C, or ideally 1.5C, goal in the 2015 Paris agreement.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“The defining challenge of the 21st century can only be resolved through co-ordinated government action — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a43427ac-0e7e-48bf-8c3e-4165179afff4\">especially by China and the US</a> — in concert with the private sector and non-governmental bodies. This, above all, is what the world needs to see from COP27” — FT editorial</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Starting today, FT Live</em> <em>will host a series of in-person, virtual and hybrid discussions with leading thinkers on sustainability. Each one will complement the themes set out in the presidency programme that day. </em><a href=\"https://ftcop.live.ft.com/?reference=ftcuratednewsletters&amp;utm_source=news&amp;utm_medium=ftcuratednewsletters&amp;utm_campaign=2022PCOP27\"><em>Register your interest here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Chinese exports fall for first time since 2020</strong> China's exports contracted in October <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a29822d-2e57-451d-8666-29c2217dcaf3\">for the first time since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, a sign of mounting pressure on an economy still gripped by strict antivirus measures. China's National Health Commission over the weekend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99693f8f-c9fd-4f0e-85dd-2fcff12853b3\">quashed hopes for an immediate easing</a> of the country's rigid zero-Covid restrictions. Despite the warning, shares in mainland China and Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/987dfad0-90c3-45af-a613-1946c0b2a447#post-3186d649-e9dd-4fa2-813c-d4950a3f7770\">rose sharply today</a>. </p> <p><strong>2. Oaktree sells Evergrande's ‘Versailles mansion' plot in Hong Kong</strong> US distressed debt investor Oaktree Capital has sold a 2.2mn sq ft plot of land <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d52f90-9a13-4c1d-a7aa-c0ba3ba192c7\">seized from Evergrande in Hong Kong</a> that was intended for the construction of a Versailles-inspired mansion for the developer's chair. Evergrande was forced to take a $770mn loss on the project, codenamed “Project Castle”, following the sale. </p> <p><strong>3. Apple warns of iPhone shipment delays</strong> Apple has warned that global shipments of its newest high-end iPhones will be delayed in the run-up to the Christmas period <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e9cd061-99c3-4638-8c19-c365099507dd\">after China's zero-Covid lockdowns</a> caused havoc at a factory run by main supplier Foxconn. The iPhone powers about half of Apple's global sales, and the December quarter is typically its most lucrative period.</p> <p><strong>4. US oil producers reap $200bn windfall</strong> Aggregate net income for publicly listed oil and gas companies operating in the US came to $200.24bn for the second and third quarters of the year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d84255c-84ba-4462-b80a-8593352852e2\">according to an analysis of earnings reports and estimates</a> carried out by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights for the Financial Times. The figure — which includes supermajors, midsized integrated groups and smaller independent shale operators — marks the sector's most profitable six months on record.</p> <p><strong>5. Chinese chip designers slow down processors to dodge US sanctions</strong> Alibaba and start-up Biren Technology <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df13a5e-84e8-44af-b0d3-3e3efa6a8671\">are tweaking their most advanced chip designs</a> to reduce processing speeds and avoid US-imposed sanctions aimed at suppressing Chinese computing power. Sanctions announced by Washington last month cap the processing power of any semiconductor shipped into China without a licence.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Midterm elections</strong> Democrats are racing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25427a8f-efde-4892-9291-4e3fd8a03a23\">to rally their voters</a> in a bid to avoid sweeping defeats in tomorrow's midterm elections. Early voting data point to a high turnout across the country and massive spending on political advertising as both parties make their final pitches to Americans.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> The Senate race in Georgia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a5a40ae-ab95-4c95-8523-712d61061639\">is one of the most closely-followed elections</a>. Washington bureau chief James Politi reports from the city of McDonough, Georgia on the contest between Trump-backed Herschel Walker and incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock.</p></li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11694029.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><em>Join Edward Luce, Rana Foroohar, James Politi and veteran commentator Norm Ornstein on November 10 for a subscriber-exclusive webinar staged with the Swamp Notes newsletter to discuss the US midterm results.

Elsewhere in the technology sector Take-Two Interactive, the company behind the popular <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game series, also reports earnings today. Drugmaker BioNTech also has third-quarter results amid concerns about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4cea6be-2e96-4458-a441-56fa79c7203e\">falling vaccine demand</a> in 2023. </p> <p><strong>Monetary policy </strong>Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Loretta Mester and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston president Susan Collins participate in moderated discussion at the <a href=\"https://www.clevelandfed.org/events/2022/ev-20221107-women-in-economics-symposium\">Women in Economics Symposium</a> organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president Thomas Barkin will give opening remarks at a conference entitled <a href=\"https://fedcommunities.org/event/district-dialogues-demystifying-inflation/\">“Demystifying Inflation”</a> hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.</p> <p><strong>US Supreme Court to consider restraining regulators' power</strong> The US Supreme Court will hear arguments that could make enforcement more complicated for federal agencies. The cases involve the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission and hit at the core of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6eec281c-0201-4576-b1a1-919bd8100e58\">a fraught debate on the boundaries of regulatory authority</a>.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Corporations can no longer remain black boxes</strong> New rules on corporate pay transparency which came into effect in New York state last week have exposed a huge bifurcation between lower level employee pay and those in the upper ranks. But pay transparency is just the tip of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ab3ec60-dcba-4fd7-846f-0acbe36ffa65\">a much bigger iceberg of corporate opacity</a>, warns Rana Foroohar.</p> <p><strong>Economists see recession coming, so maybe it's not </strong>For the first time, economists not only expect a recession in the US in the next year, but give it a high probability of more than 60 per cent. Given their record of missing big turns in the story, it's worth asking whether the consensus is, in fact, unlikely. <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/c728b7f0-b4dc-46d7-8089-36734a266e03\">Sometimes the inevitable never happens</a>, writes Ruchir Sharma.</p> <p><strong>How Elon Musk's ‘war room' of advisers are transforming Twitter </strong>In his first week as owner, the billionaire operated with a cast of trusted lieutenants from a secretive “war room” in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cfad930-d712-4ca6-bf57-f4632b6c6db1\">axe management, begin job cuts and launch products</a>.</p> <p><strong>HSBC strains reach breaking point </strong>As a financial expression of globalisation, HSBC's long history of financing China's business activities around the world looked smarter than ever. That was until President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80fd0450-9100-4c40-a579-1bdd4d2f1340\">turned increasingly authoritarian</a> at home and hostile towards the west, writes Patrick Jenkins.</p> <p><strong>Women are big losers in the politics of pockets</strong> Asking a woman if she has an inside jacket pocket is like asking if she has a ticket to the moon, writes Pilita Clark. The situation is as bad when it comes to women's trousers, she says. Good news for the $56bn global handbag market but a lot of women would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58904cf6-198b-4a70-abee-c2c821a4b318\">cheerfully do what men have done for centuries</a> and carry everything we need in pockets, she argues.</p> <h1>Television</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/988bbeb1-4db0-4319-bc94-f76745bbec44\">Series 5 of <em>The Crown</em> is a long-awaited salacious portrayal of divorce</a>, tell-all interviews and, er, toe-sucking. For many viewers it's the crescendo that the show has been building to, but it has already sparked backlash, leading Netflix to add a disclaimer that the series is a “fictional dramatisation”.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Sophia Smith 2022 'FirstFT: US plans to sell carbon credits to companies' FT.com 7 November.
