  "title": "Covid-19 Cases Drop in Southeast Asia, Easing Supply-Chain Crunch; Apple became the latest company to blame disruptions in the region for lost sales",
  "text": "<p>Tight restrictions on factory production in Malaysia earlier this year cut into global semiconductor manufacturing, as the country is a major hub for chip packaging. That caused downstream effects, including to car makers who were short on chips.</p><p>The periodic closures of factories across Asia because of the pandemic highlights the fragility of the global supply chain that has already been battered this year by storms, plant fires and power outages around the world.</p><p>Things are now looking up for Southeast Asia. In recent months, a major drop in Covid-19 cases across much of the region has paved the way for economic reopenings. In Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, average daily confirmed cases are now at less than half the level that they were at the start of September, when many of the countries were in the throes of a major wave driven by the Delta variant.</p><p>Vietnam averaged around 13,000 cases in early September, but the daily average has since dropped to around 4,000. In Malaysia, Covid-19 cases peaked in late August at around 20,000, but have since dropped to around 6,000.</p><p>The decline in cases, along with easing restrictions on factories, means that a major contributor to global supply delays is set to ease, though problems including labor shortages mean it could take weeks or months for manufacturing to be fully restored in some places.</p><p>Industry experts in Malaysia say manufacturing conditions are improving and supply is picking up as factories ratchet back up to full capacity. Demand for semiconductors remains high, however, and supply will remain tight in the months to come.</p><p>Vietnam, which implemented tight policies requiring factories to reduce their workforces or close in July, significantly loosened restrictions from early October. Now, factories are revving back up.</p><p>Foxconn Technology Group, which supplies Apple, said its facilities in Vietnam are operating normally. One technician for a shoe factory in southern Vietnam said the factory was now operating with 4,000 of its 7,000 workers, and expected to restore full production by November.</p><p>An employee of a large American apparel company said supplier factories in Vietnam already had around three-quarters of their workers back.</p><p>Factories in Malaysia have also largely reopened, after the government implemented new policies in August allowing manufacturers with highly vaccinated workforces to progressively return to normal production.</p><p>Apple's CEO Tim Cook said that while Covid-19 disruptions in Southeast Asia contributed to the company's supply-chain issues in the most recent quarter, they have \"improved materially across October to where we currently are.\" Mr. Cook acknowledged that despite improvements, the situation remains unpredictable.</p><p>Southeast Asia isn't out of the woods, and there could be risks for manufacturers in the region going forward. A divergence in vaccine access means that some countries in the region, like Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, have fully vaccinated only about a quarter of their populations, according to Our World in Data. By contrast, others like Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia, are at over 70%.</p><p>Another continuing concern is labor shortages, and getting migrant workers back to factory floors. Peter Mumford, Southeast Asia practice head for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm, said that more than a million workers from southern Vietnam are estimated to have returned to their hometowns between July and September, with several hundred thousand more heading back after the recent reopening.</p><p>\"While most facilities in southern Vietnam are now running again, labor shortages will likely delay a full recovery in output for several months,\" he said in a recent note.</p><p>One closely watched industry is Malaysia semiconductors.</p><p>Wong Siew Hai, president of the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association, said manufacturing in the country has improved immensely over the past few months, as most factories have vaccinated almost all of their staff and are back at full capacity. The semiconductor sector faces challenges meeting ever-increasing demand, however, and many Malaysian manufacturers are now focused on expanding operations by 10%-20% over the next year to ease supply strains.</p><p>\"We're not quite at pre-Covid levels. It'll take some time, maybe six months to a year,\" Mr. Wong said. \"With capacity increases, things will be even better than before.\"</p><p>Write to Jon Emont at jonathan.emont@wsj.com and Feliz Solomon at feliz.solomon@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Cases Drop in Southeast Asia, Easing Supply-Chain Crunch</p>",
