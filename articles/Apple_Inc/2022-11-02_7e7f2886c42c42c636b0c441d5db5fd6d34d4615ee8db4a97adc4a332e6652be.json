  "text": "<p>Let's take a closer look at these electric SUVs and find the right one for you. Note that this comparison pits the 2022 EV6 against the 2023 ID.4 because Volkswagen VWAGY dealers have already switched over to the new model year.</p><p>2022 Kia EV6</p><p>The new-for-2022 Kia KR:000270 EV6 is an electric vehicle that blends aspects of a crossover and a hatchback, combining them into one of the most attractive bodies to debut this year. It boasts a range of up to 310 miles and will be offered in a high-performance GT edition with a white-knuckle 576 horsepower. Pricing starts at $41,400.</p><p>Kia EV6 highlights</p><p>Greater range and efficiency: The EV6, in its longest-range form, boasts a driving range of up to 310 miles between charges. That beats the ID.4, which gets up to 275. The EPA estimates that EV6 owners could spend as little as $550 a year on energy, while ID.4 drivers will spend $600 at the least.</p><p>Gorgeous inside and out: Kia calls the EV6's design language \"digital tiger.\" Call it whatever you want. We're taken with it. On the outside, it's sleek and rakish. On the inside, it's like something from the future. The driver's instrument panel and the central touchscreen are technically separate screens, but in person, you'd never know it wasn't one huge, curved screen. Add the aluminum pedals and contrasting-color suede and vegan leather seats of higher trim levels, and you have a cabin that belongs in a luxury sports car.</p><p>High-powered options: The base EV6 has an adequate 167 horsepower. But Kia offers options for 225, 320, and an absurd-in-an-affordable-car 576 horses. There's a trade-off between range and power in electric cars. Buyers have to give away one to get the other. But the EV6, in its most extreme form, can get from 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds.</p><p>2023 Volkswagen ID.4</p><p>The Volkswagen ID.4 is a practical electric SUV with outstanding safety scores and a lower starting price than most rivals. Our test drivers found it pleasant and \"a painless transition\" from gas-powered driving. It has a range of up to 275 miles between charges. Pricing starts at $37,495.</p><p>Volkswagen ID.4 highlights</p><p>Lower price, and possibly much lower price: The ID.4's starting price is thousands below that of the EV6. But we anticipate a major change soon. The federal government recently changed its electric car tax credit system so that only vehicles built in North America qualify for a $7,500 EV tax rebate. Volkswagen recently began assembling the ID.4 in Tennessee. The U.S. Department of Energy is still updating its list of which vehicles qualify for the tax credit, but we anticipate that the ID.4 will soon be eligible for the full federal discount. The EV6 will not.</p><p>See: Want that $7,500 EV tax break? Why buyers need to talk with an accountant and not just a car dealer</p><p>Clever ID. Light system: The ID.4 has one of our favorite new technologies. It's a thin light strip mounted where the windshield meets the dashboard that pulses from side to side to show navigation cues and shows the battery's charge state. It's a subtle, unobtrusive way to communicate key information and it's… well… it's cute.</p><p>More cargo space: EV design keeps all the crucial moving parts under the floor, allowing for more cabin space than gas-powered cars. Volkswagen has made the most of that opportunity with the ID.4. It's smaller than the EV6 but offers significantly more cargo space.</p><p>See: How much does it cost to charge an electric car? We do the math</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Either vehicle would make a compelling first electric car. Both offer the brisk acceleration common to EVs, modern styling, Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto, and a range of powertrain choices that let you pick a capable commuter or something with some zip.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Kia EV6 is sexy, available with sports car-like speed, and can go up to 310 miles between charges. The Volkswagen ID.4 is cute, less expensive (soon, probably much less expensive), and earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's highest possible safety award (the EV6 has not yet been tested). Either one could make a great family car, but they have wildly different personalities. Only your own priorities can tell you which spirit appeals to you.</p><p>Specs </p><p>2022 Kia EV6                        2023 Volkswagen ID.4  Starting Price        $41,400                             $37,495  Popular Powertrains  Engine                Electric motor                      Electric motor  Horsepower            167 hp                              201 hp  Torque                258 lb-ft                           229 lb-ft  Transmission          1-speed direct drive                1-speed direct drive  Fuel Economy          136 city/100 hwy/117 combined MPGe  116 city/98 hwy/107 combined MPGe  Maximum Range         310 miles                           275 miles  Also Available        Dual-motor, AWD                     Dual-motor, AWD  Specs  Basic Warranty        5 years/60,000 miles                4 years/50,000 miles  Powertrain Warranty   10 years/100,000 miles              4 years/50,000 miles  Battery Warranty      10 years/100,000 miles              8 years/100,000 miles  Max Seating Capacity  5                                   5  Wheelbase             114.2 inches                        108.9 inches  Overall Length        184.3 inches                        180.5 inches  Width                 74.0 inches                         72.9 inches  Height                60.8 inches                         64.4 inches  Turning Diameter      38.2 feet                           33.6 feet  Headroom, Front       39.0 inches                         41.1 inches  Headroom, Rear        38.0 inches                         38.4 inches  Legroom, Front        42.4 inches                         41.1 inches  Legroom, Rear         39.0 inches                         37.6 inches  Shoulder Room, Front  57.8 inches                         57.5 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear   55.6 inches                         55.9 inches  Cargo Volume          24.4/50.2 cubic feet                30.3/64.2 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com. </p><p>The 2022 Kia EV6 vs. the 2023 Volkswagen ID.4: which electric SUV is better?</p>",
