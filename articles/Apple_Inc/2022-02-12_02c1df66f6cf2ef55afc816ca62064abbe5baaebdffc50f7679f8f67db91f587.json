  "title": "Super Bowl Halftime Show: Snoop Dogg, Eminem and the Reign of Middle-Aged MCs; A halftime show with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem helps give classic rap its biggest stage yet",
  "text": "<p>Hip-hop \"has been a part of halftime shows in the past, with great artists, but I think this is the first time that hip-hop has been the creative driving force,\" says Jesse Collins, an executive producer for the show alongside Jay-Z and Roc Nation who worked on last year's performance by R&amp;B-pop star The Weeknd.</p><p>The halftime show marks a new milestone for hip-hop. Considered music's biggest concert, with around 100 million tuning in, it has for decades showcased veterans of rock, pop and R&amp;B music. The arrival of hip-hop's golden age on the Super Bowl stage is a historic sign that the genre's elders are making their mark on the music business like never before.</p><p>\"Snoop is our Rolling Stones,\" Mr. Collins says. \"Hip-hop is 50 years old—it has had a chance to have eras, fundamental shifts in sound and style,\" he says. \"There's classic hip-hop now.\"</p><p>Classic rap is having a big moment as hip-hop approaches its 50th birthday in 2023. Verzuz, the streaming event that gained popularity during Covid-19 lockdowns, celebrates hip-hop and R&amp;B legends through live streams of \"battles.\" High-profile books about beloved hip-hop figures like 2Pac and J Dilla have made waves.</p><p>At the Grammy Awards, older MCs are getting their due after years of feeling sidelined: The average age of rappers nominated for best rap album last year is 42. The winner, Nas, 48, is experiencing a creative resurgence, critics say. Meanwhile, other rappers are taking cues from hip-hop's golden era: The Griselda rap crew from Buffalo, N.Y., which includes 39-year-old Westside Gunn, makes music inspired in part by the 1990s act Wu-Tang Clan. Even younger rap artists like Megan Thee Stallion, 26, and Cordae, 24, have made traditional beats and flows their own in new music.</p><p>For years, classic rap faced an uphill climb, compared with classic rock, which took off in the 1980s—but that is changing now that hip-hop and R&amp;B is the most popular genre in the U.S., accounting for 28% of total music consumption, including sales and streaming, according to MRC Data. As listeners raised on 1990s and 2000s rap grow older, classic hip-hop is gradually becoming the new classic rock, analysts say.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which artists are you most looking forward to watching perform at this year's Super Bowl halftime show? Join the conversation below.</p><p>On streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, Americans are listening to more hip-hop from the past as part of a broader trend of \"nostalgia listening\" across genres. Last year, 65% of U.S. audio streams of hip-hop songs were \"catalog\" tracks that were 18 months or older, up from 54% in 2020—the biggest jump of any genre, MRC Data says.</p><p>\"There's clearly an appetite\" for classic rap, says Carl Chery, creative director, head of urban music for Spotify.</p><p>At The Wall Street Journal's request, music-analytics firm Chartmetric drilled down deeper by examining the \"Spotify popularity\" of hip-hop tracks released before 2010 versus those released after 2010.</p><p>Chartmetric found that, while post-2010 hip-hop tracks are still more popular, the gap shrank last year. Between February 2021 and February 2022, the average popularity of pre-2010 tracks rose 15% compared with the prior year—double the 7.5% rise for post-2010 tracks.</p><p>Among the popular tracks at U.S. radio stations are 2Pac's \"California Love,\" the Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Hypnotize,\" 50 Cent's \"In Da Club,\" DMX's \"Party Up (Up in Here)\" and Missy Elliott's \"Get Ur Freak On.\" Monthly spins of the most-played classic hip-hop songs are up nearly 40% over the past five years—from 76,200 spins in January 2017 to 105,700 in January 2022, according to MRC Data.</p><p>As for album sales, rap albums from the 1990s have accounted for a bigger share of overall hip-hop sales every year since 2017, MRC Data says. Together, 1990s and 2000s albums were 33% of hip-hop record sales last year, up from 28% in 2017.</p><p>The 2022 halftime show is a product of the recent partnership between the NFL and Jay-Z's Roc Nation. It is also a love letter to hip-hop in Los Angeles, which is hosting the game at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.</p><p>Dr. Dre, the show's linchpin, established himself as a member of the controversial Los Angeles gangsta-rap act N.W.A and is known for his '70s-influenced \"G-funk\" style. His protégés, including Snoop Dogg and Eminem, have helped him stay relevant across several generations of rap. While Ms. Blige is an R&amp;B singer (who has appeared at the event before), her music is rooted in hip-hop culture. Mr. Lamar is famous for his lyricism and technical virtuosity.</p><p>Dan Runcie, founder of Trapital, which covers the business of hip-hop, says this year's Dr. Dre-led lineup may be a course correction after fans expressed disappointment that the 2019 halftime show in Atlanta—a city widely considered a hip-hop capital—didn't embrace Atlanta hip-hop, save for a supporting appearance by local hero Big Boi of Outkast.</p><p>Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Mr. Lamar are synonymous with Los Angeles hip-hop. In many ways, this year's performance is a risk, given that a rap-focused show may turn off some television viewers. Asked about the idea for the show, Mr. Collins responded that \"these things start with Jay.\"</p><p>\"N.W.A put not only America but the world on notice about what was going on in hip-hop and on the West Coast and what they were experiencing. And, in a way, Dre and Jay are doing it again. They're putting everybody on notice that hip-hop is here,\" Mr. Collins says. \"It's just in our DNA forever.\"</p><p>Write to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com</p><p>Super Bowl Halftime Show: Snoop Dogg, Eminem and the Reign of Middle-Aged MCs</p>",
