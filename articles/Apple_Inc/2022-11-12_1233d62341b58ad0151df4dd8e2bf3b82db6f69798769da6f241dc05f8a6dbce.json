  "text": "<p>Tech giants are going to get less giant as they prepare for a possible recession. Meta on Wednesday announced layoffs of more than 11,000 workers, or 13% of staff, as the Facebook parent tries to cope with a digital-ad market slump. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. has launched a cost-cutting review focusing on unprofitable business units amid a slowdown in its core retail business. Amazon has told employees in certain unprofitable divisions to look for jobs elsewhere in the company, because their current teams were being suspended or closed. Meta shares gained 5.2% Wednesday.</p><p>WALT DISNEY CO.</p><p>DIS -13%</p><p>The plot driving Disney's streaming business is getting more complicated. The entertainment giant's flagship streaming service added 12.1 million new subscribers in the latest quarter, but the division lost $1.47 billion. The results showed that Disney faces a balancing act, spending enough on popular shows and movies to attract new users while reining in costs so the business can break even. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said changes will help stem losses, including a new ad-supported subscription tier that will compete with a product launched by Netflix Inc. Disney shares sank 13% Wednesday.</p><p>COINBASE GLOBAL INC.</p><p>COIN -9.5%</p><p>The fall of a crypto star roiled the universe of digital currencies. FTX, a sizable crypto exchange rocked by massive client withdrawals, found a rescuer in rival Binance on Tuesday only to see the deal collapse Wednesday. On Friday, FTX filed for bankruptcy and its CEO resigned. Shares of Coinbase Global, another crypto exchange, lost 9.5% Wednesday while shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. fell 14%.</p><p>TESLA INC.</p><p>TSLA -7.2%</p><p>The world's richest person went on another selling spree after buying Twitter Inc. Elon Musk sold almost $4 billion in Tesla stock after his $44 billion purchase of Twitter closed. He has sold more than $19 billion of the electric-vehicle maker's stock this year. He said after doing so in April and in August that he wasn't planning additional sales. Mr. Musk is on the hook for $33.5 billion in equity financing to pay for the Twitter deal, and his takeover has been bumpy. He initiated layoffs of half the company's staff and tweeted it was losing $4 million a day. Tesla shares lost 7.2% Wednesday.</p><p>ADIDAS AG</p><p>ADDYY +3.3%</p><p>Adidas is ditching Ye, but keeping the Yeezys. The German sporting-goods company said it will sell shoes based on the Yeezy designs under another name, despite scrapping its lucrative collaboration with rapper Kanye West, who goes by Ye. Adidas ended the Yeezy venture with Mr. West following a string of controversies including a recent anti-Semitic outburst by the artist. Finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said the brand was the sole owner of all rights to existing products except the Yeezy name. American depositary shares of Adidas rose 3.3% Wednesday.</p><p>LYFT INC.</p><p>LYFT -23%</p><p>Lyft is losing speed. The ride-sharing app posted slowing revenue growth and weak ridership numbers in the latest quarter. The company ended the period with 20.31 million riders, fewer than analysts predicted and below the 23 million it had in the quarter before the pandemic struck. The disappointing numbers offset the increase in revenue that Lyft made per rider, after a yearlong driver shortage pushed ride prices to record highs. Meanwhile, rival Uber Technologies Inc. said Nov. 1 that its rider count had bounced back to prepandemic levels. Lyft shares plummeted 23% Tuesday.</p><p>APPLE INC.</p><p>AAPL +8.9%</p><p>Apple's major iPhone maker is answering the call. Days after Apple said its iPhone Pro shipments would be lower than expected because of supply disruptions, the chief executive of Foxconn Technology Group said the supplier aims to bring production levels back to normal at its main iPhone factory in China. Foxconn has struggled to contain a Covid outbreak that began in October. The site operates under a system where workers only move between on-site lodging and production lines. Apple shares gained 8.9% Thursday.</p>",
