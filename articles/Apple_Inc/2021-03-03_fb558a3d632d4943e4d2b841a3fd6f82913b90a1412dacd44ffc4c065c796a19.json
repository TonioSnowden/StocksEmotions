  "text": "<p>You would need to work hard indeed to find anyone under 30 not aware of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2bcc42d-130c-4610-a715-ee8d4f29fb11\">Billie Eilish</a> —&#xa0;or, just as importantly, without strong related opinions. In the age of fractured mass entertainment, subdivided into billions of individual playlists, the 19-year-old singer is a throwback —&#xa0;a reminder of a time when everyone knew the same pop stars. She is also, of course, an avatar of that very here and now, the favourite torch singer of Generation Z. Such is the dramatic tension of <em>Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry</em>, the new documentary released by Apple.&#xa0;</p> <p>At first glance, the recent cautionary tale about Britney Spears, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33e910e4-c93b-471c-9076-17b782d28670\"><em>Framing Britney</em></a>, might have been purpose-built to compare and contrast: Eilish exploited by no one, a young woman performing in outsize puffa jackets and huge neon green shellsuits, a tribute to her own self-possession and —&#xa0;if you felt like being optimistic —&#xa0;a detoxified music business. (Maybe.)</p> <p>To begin, the mood is scuffed and homespun. Director R.J. Cutler started shooting in distant 2016; early scenes find Eilish juggling new success and average teenage stuff at her low-key family home in Los Angeles. Mostly, the focus is the telepathic creative ping-pong with co-songwriter brother Finneas. But things naturally get weirder. Fame and fans are timeless headspinners. In fact, a lot of the film works best as a study of the latter —&#xa0;less about Eilish fans per se than her interdependence with them. “You guys need to be OK,” she tells one overheated audience, “because you're the reason I'm OK.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Later, a scene in which she meets her own childhood idol Justin Bieber —&#xa0;Eilish sobs uncontrollably — is strange and plaintive. Both are behemoths of 21st-century pop, but she is the digital native of the two, her life lived through the prism of the internet even before stardom. That much —&#xa0;the inescapable online — hums away in the background of everything. Cutler and Eilish are smart enough to make it part of the point. In the past, a movie like <em>The World's a Little Blurry</em> would have offered a glimpse behind the scenes. Now, diverting as it is, it can only come after Instagram and every other platform whose <em>raison d'être</em> is the same promise, the lure of 24-7-365 authenticity. That much is Billie Eilish's world — the rest of us are just living in it too.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV+</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry — portrait of a very 21st-century pop star' FT.com 3 March.
