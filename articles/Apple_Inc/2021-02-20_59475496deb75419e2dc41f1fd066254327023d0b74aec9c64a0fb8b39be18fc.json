  "text": "<p>John Davis</p><p>Abilene, Texas</p><p>We try to have a routine and ritual for our grandchildren. I will bring them to my office and they do the same things that they always doâ€”take everything out of my desk and set it up and have a great time. I teach in the College of Business at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and sometimes I'll bring them to play on the lawn or to chase ducks by the pond. We are not keeping them on an extended basis, like so many of the people in the article, but we try to keep them entertained and having fun. Intermittently this past year, the grandchildren would stay with us for three to five days to give their parents a break. After reading the article, I was impressed by the people who would pick up and move across the country and retire just so they can help their children with the grandkids. That's an extraordinary commitment. I'm genuinely grateful for my children and grandchildren but I don't know if I'd be able to do that, especially since my wife and I still have our full-time jobs.</p><p>Larry Mori</p><p>Huntington Beach, Calif.</p><p>In the fall of 2020, my wife and I made the decision to help out with our three grandchildren who go to school nearby. We didn't want them to be in daycare, and their parents are both busy with their full-time jobs. So it seemed like the best option. The kids were fully online but we'd get them up early in the morning and have them prepped for school for four days of the week.</p><p>When they were doing online school at our home we would monitor them throughout the day but we would also try to make the day as \"normal\" as possible. My wife and I would have them practice piano, guitar or singing for some of the day or we would take them out to get some exercise and make them lunch.</p><p>The biggest difference between raising our children and grandchildren has been our energy levels. You have to be completely focused on taking care of them and not trying to multitask. I've also learned to cater to their unique personalities. The older one is sort of in constant iPad status, while the younger one tends to like the arts more. When our children were growing up, my wife was handling all of the duties, so it's basically a relearning period where I see some of the nuances in my grandkids that I know I missed in my kids when I was working.</p><p>Bill Culver</p><p>Waukesha, Wis.</p><p>We have great kids and wonderful grandchildren. We have four children near us and seven grandchildren between them. I've been fortunate enough to be retired since I was 61 so I've been heavily involved since before the pandemic. I can say with confidence that my life would be much less complete or fulfilling if we didn't have these grandkids. The pandemic has not stopped us from spending time with the grandkids and helping out their parents. They've actually been very helpful and volunteered to help me with my projects. I needed to put together a workbench and, my God, were the 14- and 15-year-olds helpful. They would help take the tools downstairs and put everything together. It was such a wonderful experience.</p><p>Now with most of the kids having smartphones, I get the most wonderful greetings from the grandkids by text messages. We tend to communicate with most of them directly. Their parents will often send us their schedules for the day to let us know what's going on and where we need to be. I feel like I'm a far better grandfather than I was a father. I wish I had been more patient with my kids, and I am truly grateful that I've lived this long to raise these grandkids.</p><p>Ellen Mannos</p><p>Chicago</p><p>We have four grandchildren under the age of 8 from one family. We actually have a formal schedule to help organize when my husband and I will need to take care of the kids and what they need to be doing. We run it like a school. They get their lunch break and go out in the backyard for recess or play basketball in the alley, whatever they can do for a half hour, 45 minutes. Then they come back in and then we're running up and down the stairs, making sure everybody's logged on to their Zoom class. It's kind of hilarious to watch them function like these little mini adults.</p><p>We've been helping out intermittently since the family moved here to Chicago a few years ago, but when the pandemic hit and the schools shut down, our daughter asked us to be more involved. We've made some adjustments because the hours and amount of work can be overwhelming but we're hoping this arrangement will only be temporary until our daughter can get some more help around the house.</p><p>Jeanne Trimble</p><p>Northern Virginia</p><p>My son and daughter-in-law were reluctant to put the kids in daycare and were struggling to keep up with their own work schedules. You can't be a conscientious employee and take care of a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old at the same time. Nobody can multitask like that. I'm 64 and was planning to retire in two years but my husband and I consulted with our bank and figured out that with Social Security, I could retire early to help out.</p><p>I ended up retiring in August and have been taking care of the kids pretty much full time. I went from an eight-hour a day job to a nine-hour a day job. They've been able to compensate me for some of the work to make up for the retirement but the pay cut has definitely been worth it. How many other people get the chance to spend this much time with their grandkids? I didn't want to pass up that opportunity. We try to get them outdoors and out of the house in general as much as we can. It's actually been a positive that with the kids, I'm getting more physical activity running up and down the stairs. I've been more exhausted but it's been nice realizing that I'm not alone as a grandparent. I was astounded by the statistics that so many people have turned to grandparents for help. I had always heard being a grandparent is the most awesome thing in the world and they were absolutely right.</p><p>Write to Xavier Cousens at Xavier.Cousens@wsj.com</p><p>How Grandparents Help Out During Covid-19: Readers Respond</p>",
