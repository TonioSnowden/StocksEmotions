  "title": "India Takes Aim at Chip Industry With $20 Billion Push for Factory",
  "text": "<p>The site is now earmarked as the likely home of a roughly $20 billion semiconductor fabrication plant to be built by Taiwan's Hon Hai Technology Group, also known as Foxconn, which already manufactures Apple iPhones in the country, in a tie-up with India-focused commodities powerhouse Vedanta Group. The Foxconn-Vedanta deal would represent the largest corporate investment in India and its first privately owned fabrication plant.</p><p>Indian officials are hoping for construction to start next year, and for operations to begin around 2025.</p><p>\"It's an opening of a door to many decades of huge opportunities,\" said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India's junior technology minister, when the deal was announced in September.</p><p>The Modi government's foray into the global semiconductor race is part of a concerted push to boost high-value manufacturing in India, which has long trailed regional rivals because of concerns over the country's challenging bureaucracy, protectionist rules and poor infrastructure. Spurred by a desire to expand its economy, create jobs and shore up supply chain security, India has announced tens of billions of dollars worth of production-linked incentives in the past two years to draw investment to critical sectors including electronics manufacturing, batteries, automobiles to solar panels.</p><p>Manufacturers can claim the funds based on how much they increase their production compared with the previous year. India also has focused efforts on streamlining the processes to acquire the varied licenses required to operate in India.</p><p>The efforts have delivered some encouraging results at a time when geopolitical tensions and pandemic supply chain disruptions have prompted Western companies to look beyond China. Foreign direct investment into India crossed more than $80 billion last year, a record, and Apple, seen by many as a barometer of India's place in the global tech supply chain, has fast-tracked the production of its new iPhone 14 in India.</p><p>India's exports exceeded $400 billion in its fiscal year ended March 31, rising 35% from two years earlier, before the first incentives were announced.</p><p>Semiconductor production will be the greatest test yet of India's capabilities. Chip plants require years to build, years more to break even, and depend upon a highly trained workforce. So much as a flicker in the electricity supply can create lengthy delays and cost tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Despite strides in local automobile and smartphone production, India remains largely unproven in high-tech manufacturing and has struggled to shake off its tag as a place difficult to do business with. State officials acknowledge the challenge ahead but hope this project will change that perception.</p><p>\"Frankly, I am not aware in India if you can compare this project to any other project anywhere in the country, by scale, size, execution capabilities, or infrastructure-level connectivity,\" said Hareet Shukla, managing director of Dholera Industrial City Development Ltd., the agency overseeing the development.</p>",
