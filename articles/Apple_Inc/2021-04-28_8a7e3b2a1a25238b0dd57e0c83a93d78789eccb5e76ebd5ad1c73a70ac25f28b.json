  "text": "<p><strong>My personal style signifiers</strong> are hoop earrings – I wear a pair of bamboo door knockers that have my name engraved on them – and a red lip. <a href=\"https://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/product/13854/52593/products/makeup/lips/lipstick/retro-matte-lipstick\">MAC's Ruby Woo lipstick</a> was the first colour I discovered, back in high school. I&#xa0;don't know if they've ever changed it or it just keeps getting better with time, but I've been wearing that shade since I was 16 or 17 years old. I even work out in a red lip.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The last things I bought and loved</strong> were <a href=\"https://douglasandbec.com/\">Douglas and Bec</a> lampshades for my bedroom, for either side of my bed. And I've been getting a lot of organic flowers from <a href=\"http://www.lilylodge.com/\">Lily Lodge</a>. In the past year or so they have been my saving grace. They come in a bucket – I arrange them and separate them out in my collection of vases and they bring me a lot of joy. </p> <p><strong>The places I can't wait to go back to</strong> are my best friends' apartments. I cannot wait to be in my friends' homes again, and&#xa0;to have them in my home. My friend Monica Paganucci's dinner table is where I&#xa0;long to go, and also [<em>Harper's Bazaar</em> editor-in-chief] <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81fcec6f-d5b8-4da0-bf1d-dfe2643638ee\">Samira Nasr</a>'s dinner table, or the floor in front of the TV, just lying around and playing with her kid. For somewhere gorgeous, there's the Ritz in Paris for couture in July – nothing better. And I'd love to get back to the <a href=\"https://www.aman.com/resorts/amangiri\">Amangiri</a> hotel, set right in the Utah desert's canyons&#xa0;and gorges. </p> <p><strong>The best souvenir I've brought home</strong> is&#xa0;a cake stand I found in an antique store in Italy one summer and carried across Europe. It's honestly not that pretty – I'm not sure what drew me to it – but I held it by hand on the plane until I got home. I&#xa0;don't make cakes. I've never made a cake. And yet I have this cake stand. But it's a really good souvenir of that trip to Italy.</p> <p><strong>The best books I've read in the past year </strong>are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7daf2c8e-ac89-11ea-a766-7c300513fe47\"><em>The Vanishing Half</em></a> by Brit Bennett, which immerses you into a culture and a family dynamic – it's such a good page-turner. And <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Untamed-Glennon-Doyle/dp/1984801252\"><em>Untamed</em></a> by Glennon Doyle, a&#xa0;beautiful, vulnerable book that allows the reader to find the courage to be free and wild. I'm in the process of reading <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/just-as-i-am/cicely-tyson/9780062931061\"><em>Just As I Am</em></a> by Cicely Tyson. It&#xa0;shares insights about living in the&#xa0;US, what that means as a black person, and what&#xa0;it is to be an artist.</p> <p><strong>The best gift I've given recently</strong> was a bag filled with some of my favourite things to the team at my haircare&#xa0;brand <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/\">Pattern Beauty</a> for Christmas last year. There was a little tomato-red <a href=\"https://www.prada.com/gb/en/women/bags.html\">Prada zip pouch</a>; my&#xa0;favourite incense, which is Astier de Villatte's <a href=\"https://www.astierdevillatte.com/product/265/palais-de-tokyo-incense?v=265\">Palais de Tokyo</a>; <a href=\"https://shopmwpolar.com/products/black-garlic-8-8oz-pack-of-1-or-2-or-6?variant=30232350851151\">Polar black garlic</a> – I don't know what they do to this garlic but it's the most delicious thing; and sundried-tomato-stuffed olives.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The podcast I'm listening to</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-06-12/tightrope\"><em>The Tight&#xa0;Rope</em></a> with Dr Cornel West and Professor Tricia Rose, which covers issues around race and social justice. I love the nature of the conversations they have.</p> <p><strong>A recent “find”</strong> is air purifiers by Molekule. They're sleek, chic, functional and they make me feel as if good, clean things are happening in the air around me.&#xa0;I&#xa0;bring one into my trailer when I'm&#xa0;working; also my Saje essential-oil Aroma diffusers. I've been a Covid-fearful person, so I've had oregano oil because it's&#xa0;antiviral, but also sandalwood and frankincense, which really alter your mood. <em>Molekule air purifiers, from $349, </em><a href=\"https://molekule.com/\"><em>molekule.com</em></a><em>. Saje diffusers, from $45, </em><a href=\"https://www.saje.com/\"><em>saje.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>I'm feeling hopeful about </strong>the Covid-19 vaccines. And <a href=\"https://us.oatly.com/products/strawberry-frozen-dessert\">Oatly's strawberry non-ice-cream ice cream</a> makes me feel joyful, which leads to hope.</p> <p><strong>The best gift I've received recently</strong> is a&#xa0;woven hanging basket of ferns, which my mom gave me for my birthday. It's hanging right outside my front door. I&#xa0;love&#xa0;plants and I love green, so it was a thoughtful, beautiful gift. Also my dear friend Adriane gave me a set of&#xa0;four mint-coloured wine glasses by <a href=\"https://estellecoloredglass.com/\">Estelle Colored Glass</a>. </p> <p><strong>The last music I downloaded</strong> was Silk Sonic's <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7dfPqXck6BB9wpThrVYBss?si=99wYTwU0SDugFiiTQB6ESg\">“Leave The Door Open”</a>, Jazmine Sullivan's <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2JLVZYEMmqPWbUoAJAMKfm?si=fsyY5nQCQ5GJZwA2L-1i_w\">“Pick Up Your Feelings”</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2etHQJxIbV0soyPhelVs9Y?si=oBCHDk7cR5Ostk7OeNYq8w\">“Best Friend”</a> by Saweetie featuring Doja Cat. Those are my&#xa0;three go-to songs right now. And then there's the one I discovered watching <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000prjp/small-axe-series-1-lovers-rock\"><em>Lovers Rock</em></a>, the second in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59c055a9-57b5-486c-b3eb-0e0f2d712916\"><em>Small Axe</em></a> series of movies by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d66dd64e-441b-11ea-9a2a-98980971c1ff\">Steve McQueen</a>. It's an old song called <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6mxMnaQhdMaWp0XRAyjjfA?si=Djs19lUrS1q5E5GEBCADcg\">“Silly Games”</a> by Janet Kay. I will forever be changed by that movie.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>My style icon</strong> is my mother – she is the one individual who has had the greatest impact on my style. But also <a href=\"https://www.ninasimone.com/\">Nina Simone</a>, the artist <a href=\"http://lorraineogrady.com/\">Lorraine O'Grady</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1ec2178-f6a3-48e5-8af8-d57c2433d35f\">Elsa Peretti</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator?lang=en\">Tyler, The Creator</a>. To me, a style icon is about more than just clothing: it's how they move through the world.</p> <p><strong>In my fridge you'll always find</strong> <a href=\"https://www.santacruzorganic.com/products/lemonades\">Santa Cruz organic lemonade</a>, <a href=\"https://presidentcheese.com/cheese_category/butter/\">Président</a> unsalted butter, <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/en-gb/products/franks-redhot-original-cayenne-pepper-sauce?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvYSEBhDjARIsAJMn0li9WuOvK16usLA1uYL491Jz0jcQBPXTHfjcsMdb4fY7CuS9KUIg_pkaAhpvEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Frank's RedHot sauce</a>, olives and a gorgeous selection of lettuces and fresh veggies. For parsley or anything like that, I cut the bottoms off and keep them in water so basically my fridge has plants in it; there are flowering things everywhere. And I'm also obsessed with vanilla hemp milk.</p> <p><strong>An object I would never part with</strong> <strong>is…</strong> hard to choose. Everything in my home has a story. This couch I'm sitting on, it's from college and it's been reupholstered about 63&#xa0;times. There's an origami bird mobile hanging from a chandelier that was made for me by a friend. Everything is a treasure.</p> <p><strong>The gadgets I couldn't do without</strong> are&#xa0;my <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-pe/electric-toothbrushes#triggername=color_black\">Philips Sonicare toothbrush</a>, my <a href=\"https://hyperice.com/hypervolt-bluetooth\">Hypervolt vibrating massage gun</a> and a&#xa0;machine called <a href=\"https://chi.us/life-improving-products/chi-palm/\">Chi Palm</a>, which uses sound&#xa0;vibrations for relaxation. Sometimes that's better than a glass of wine.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>An indulgence I would never forgo</strong> is&#xa0;potato chips. Even more than that, French&#xa0;fries. Very rare that I'll let myself go&#xa0;towards the fries. And luxuriating on the phone talking to a friend. All my friends&#xa0;are&#xa0;so busy and our lives are so&#xa0;full&#xa0;that when we get those moments to&#xa0;have a good&#xa0;chit-chat it feels pretty indulgent and amazing.</p> <p><strong>The grooming staples I'm never without</strong> are my <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/products/leave-in\">Pattern leave-in conditioner</a> ($42) and <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/products/brush\">shower brush</a> ($17). A shower brush is the answer to poppin' curls, and the leave-in conditioner is the holy grail for me. </p> <p><strong>The last item of clothing I added to&#xa0;my wardrobe</strong> was a pair of <a href=\"https://www.maisonmargiela.com/gb/maison-margiela/women/tabi\">Maison Margiela Tabi</a> split-toe loafers in brown and&#xa0;they're the cutest, ugliest things I've&#xa0;ever seen in my life. I love them so much. I'm sure others will think they're incredibly unappealing.</p> <p><strong>The artists whose work I would collect if I could</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/barkley-l-hendricks-14929\">Barkley L Hendricks</a>, <a href=\"https://lsimpsonstudio.com/\">Lorna Simpson</a>, <a href=\"http://carriemaeweems.net/\">Carrie Mae Weems</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f16afe4-c6ed-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9\">Kerry James Marshall</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.amysherald.com/\">Amy Sherald</a>, whose portrait work&#xa0;offers me a sense of belonging and&#xa0;ease,&#xa0;which – particularly since this&#xa0;pandemic and&#xa0;in the racial reckoning that has erupted&#xa0;in response to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor – feels&#xa0;incredibly hopeful.</p> <p><strong>My wellbeing guru</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.terrilawton.com/\">Terri Lawton</a>. She is&#xa0;my facialist and I swear by what she does to my face. I've been seeing her for 20-odd years on a very regular basis. For exercise I&#xa0;alternate between the <a href=\"https://tracyanderson.com/\">Tracy Anderson</a> method and LA gym <a href=\"https://www.heartandhustle.com/\">Heart &amp; Hustle</a>, where I have a trainer and we do weights to keep up the muscle content in my body. </p> <p><strong>My favourite room in my house</strong> is my bedroom. I love the light in my bedroom. To&#xa0;be more specific, my bed. It's my favourite place – I'll lie there and listen to audiobooks before going to sleep.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>My favourite apps</strong> are <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-new-york-times/id284862083\"><em>The New York Times</em> app</a> – I love their op ed pieces – and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/about/digital-access\"><em>The New Yorker</em></a>; I just saved a <em>New Yorker</em> piece on <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/the-history-of-loneliness\">the history of loneliness</a> to read at the weekend. I also love the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/apple-books/id364709193\">Apple Books</a> app for audiobooks.</p> <p><strong>If I weren't doing what I do, I would be</strong> a therapist or a meditation teacher. I was a stylist in my former life and I was also a professional organiser – I would go into companies and rearrange their systems. So I think I would probably lean back into that, or I would be a therapist.</p><p>Source: Baya Simons.
