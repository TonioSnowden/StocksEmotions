  "text": "<p>Read: Wall Street's stock-market forecasts for 2022 were off by the widest margin since 2008: Will next year be any different?</p><p>For all the grinding lower of this market, it's still not that cheap, as Michael O'Rourke, chief strategist at JonesTrading, reminds us. He notes that the S&amp;P 500 SPX market cap to GDP has shrunk to 129% from 180% almost a year ago, thanks to the tech-led pullback.</p><p>\"That is a notable correction, but it is also a 6.7% premium to the 2000 bubble and a 50% premium to the three decades average,\" said the strategist who suggests investors keep watching this to gauge the priciness of this market.</p><p>So investors are headed into 2023 with valuations having corrected, but not a supercheap market. In short, risk appetite remains poor, and \"managers are looking to weather the storm rather than take advantage of real potential alpha,\" notes Mark Ritchie II, chief investment officer of RTM Capital Advisors and a son of the legendary investor by the same name.</p><p>But for those investors who aren't afraid to at least look at where the extra gains in this market may come from, Ritchie offers up a couple of sectors and investment ideas to watch in our call of the day, from an interview he gave to Real Vision  earlier this week.</p><p>The first is solar, a small, niche part of the market that he notes has been holding up well in line with energy prices. \"If you look at the leading names in that group, there's a few that have real earnings and sales, those could continue to be explosive,\" said Richie.</p><p>He's also keeping a close eye on biotechs, though notes it's more stock selective as some parts of the sector are not trading great. \"But there are some specific stocks that are trading very well. I think you want to be looking there potentially,\" he said.</p><p>While these two areas hold risk, Ritchie said he would be dipping into them again should they keep holding up relative to the market. \"And if you look specifically at the biotechs that are acting well, they all bottomed,\" he said.</p><p>On that, he says rather than pick up ETFs, such as the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF XBI, investors should look at companies in the larger cap that have held up well â€”Biogen BIIB, Regeneron REGN, Gilead GILD and Eli Lilly LLY, to name a few.</p><p>\"But I would just say, look at one of the biotechs that have the highest relative strength, meaning relative to the overall market, or one of the ones that are potentially hitting or trading near 52-week highs,\" said Ritchie.</p><p>In the solar group, First Solar FSLR and Enphase ENPH are two companies he notes have also been holding up well.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stock futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 are dropping, as bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y edge lower, with the dollar DXY stead. Oil prices CL.1 BRN00 are up 1.8%. The Hang Seng HK:HSI charged higher, taking a cue from Wall Street's positive session.</p><p>For more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor's Business Daily.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Third-quarter GDP was revised up to a stronger-than-expected 3.2%, w hile weekly jobless claims were lower than expected at 216,000.
