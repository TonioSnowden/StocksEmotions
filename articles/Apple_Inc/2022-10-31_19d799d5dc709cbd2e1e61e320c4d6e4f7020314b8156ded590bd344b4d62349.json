  "text": "<p>The US Supreme Court's conservative majority on Monday expressed scepticism over universities' authority to consider race as a factor in college admissions while hearing arguments in two cases on affirmative action that could have significant implications for American society and business.</p> <p>In a marathon session lasting five hours, several conservative justices proposed an alternative, race-neutral admission system as they heard cases involving policies the University of North Carolina, a public university, and Harvard University, the private Ivy League institution.</p> <p>The court's decision could significantly affect how American universities, some of the most sought-after worldwide, manage admissions, and result in radical changes to a system that for decades has taken race into account with the aim of building diverse student bodies.</p> <p>The court's six conservative justices focused on pinpointing an expiry date for admissions programmes that take race into consideration, with Amy Coney Barrett quoting a previous <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/cf44d301-a9a1-43ed-8e27-a402a1a1ef5b\">Supreme Court</a> decision that described racial classifications as “potentially dangerous”.</p> <p>Clarence Thomas also questioned the educational benefits of diversity. When UNC's counsel said diversity could lead to higher productivity, Thomas said: “I guess I don't put much stock in that because I've heard similar arguments in favour of segregation too.”</p> <p>Samuel Alito appeared partial to the argument that giving “a plus” to a minority student would disadvantage another in the “zero-sum game” of college admissions. </p> <p>The three liberal justices strongly defended the practice, saying that applicants could choose whether to disclose their race, and that it was one of numerous factors considered in admissions. </p> <p>Ketanji Brown Jackson said she feared the petitioner's arguments implied students would need to “mask their identities” in the application process “just on the basis of their difference”.</p> <p>While “everybody would rather achieve all our racial diversity goals through race neutral means”, Elena Kagan noted, the question was whether schools could “go race conscious” when needed. </p> <p>Sonia Sotomayor warned that banning a consideration of race had in some cases led to a fall in enrolment from minority students, particularly black and Native American individuals. “There is a high price to pay by banning the minor use of race in college admissions, isn't there?” she said. </p> <p>Kagan also criticised the argument that it did not matter if institutions “look like America”. </p> <p>“These are the pipelines to leadership in our society,” she said. “I thought that part of what it meant to . . . believe in American pluralism is that actually our institutions are reflective of who we are as a people in all our variety.”</p> <p>Elizabeth Prelogar, US solicitor-general, argued in favour of the universities, saying the government had an interest in preserving diverse student bodies who would go on to shape the country's military and federal agencies.</p> <p>Students for Fair Admissions, a non-profit seeking to abolish racial considerations in admissions, brought both cases. It argues race-based affirmation action has benefited African-American and Hispanic students to the detriment of Asian Americans and others.</p> <p>The group is asking the court to over-rule Grutter vs Bollinger, a landmark 2003 Supreme Court decision that allowed universities to consider race in admissions by reaffirming that diversity is a governmental interest. </p> <p>Both universities named in the cases urged the court to consider the “educational benefits” of diversity. </p> <p>Olatunde Johnson, professor at Columbia Law School, had said there was “certainly a risk” that a ruling against the universities could curb the diversity of student bodies and make colleges “vulnerable over fear . . .[of] lawsuits”.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The court's 6-3 conservative majority has already challenged longstanding legal precedents on issues such as abortion, suggesting they may be open to overturning Grutter as well. A lawyer involved in the case has told the Financial Times that “everyone is operating on the assumption” that the court will limit affirmative action at universities.</p> <p>But Johnson said it would depend on the breadth of the court's ruling, which may be difficult to predict given several justices had never expressed a public view on affirmative action.</p> <p>Corporate America is watching these cases closely, with concern that a ruling against universities will limit the diversity of their future recruits. Dozens of large businesses including American Airlines, General Electric, Meta, Google and Apple filed a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/232357/20220801135424028_Nos.%2020-1199%2021-707%20-%20Brief%20for%20Major%20American%20Business%20Enterprises%20Supporting%20Respondents.pdf\">brief</a> in support of the colleges.</p> <p>Kagan on Monday highlighted the need for companies to “have racially diverse workforces . . . to achieve their economic objectives”. </p> <p>If affirmative action precedents are overturned, “it may well be the case that a lot of these larger companies are then going to be the next defendants in these sorts of lawsuits”, said Eric Talley, professor at Columbia Law School. </p><p>Source: Stefania Palma in Washington 2022 'US Supreme Court's conservatives question affirmative action in college admissions' FT.com 31 October.
