  "title": "The cautionary tale of FTX",
  "text": "<p>Fake it till you make it: an aphorism embraced perhaps too heartily by Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. At the beginning of the year, SBF — as the board-short wearing, tousled-haired 30-year-old likes to be known — boasted an estimated paper fortune of $20bn. He ends 2022 languishing in a Bahamian jail, facing extradition to the US on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and violations of campaign-finance laws. In a written statement to a congressional committee, SBF admitted that he “fucked up”. That is one way of putting it. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f2ae696-0cba-403d-bc0f-17433b547e27\">put it another way</a>: that he is the perpetrator of one of the biggest financial frauds in history. It will ultimately be up to a jury to decide whose explanation is the most persuasive.</p> <p>There will be consequences stemming from FTX's collapse but it would be a great shame if one of them was a souring of America's love affair with entrepreneurial geniuses. It is one of US capitalism's best features that an individual with a big idea has a shot at making money from it. Iconoclasts, particularly in the realm of technology, have an illustrious history: there would be no Apple without Steve Jobs, no Amazon without Jeff Bezos, and no Microsoft without Bill Gates. Innovation requires boldness. </p> <p>But it is time for rose-tinted glasses to be removed. Technology that not many understand can also allow for obfuscation, for style over substance, and for a fear of missing out to grip even seasoned investors. Combined with an era of low interest rates and easy money — now well and truly over — it is the ideal habitat for swindlers. Exhibit A: Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, the once-hyped blood-testing company. She could ape the turtleneck sweaters and mannerisms of Apple's Jobs but her claims about Theranos's technology were rotten. She is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ab080c9-c13d-40b3-a697-9c58fd9e218c\">serving an 11-year sentence</a> for defrauding investors. &#xa0;</p> <p>That those investors included masters of the universe like Rupert Murdoch and Oracle's Larry Ellison is shocking but not surprising: even Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea Company's pitch. So too is FTX proving a cautionary tale for blue-chip investors, including Sequoia Capital and at least two pension funds. While losing money is a professional hazard for venture capitalists, pension funds have no business investing in a sector as volatile as crypto.</p> <p>There seems to have been a complete failure of basic checks into a start-up that had no board, and which accounted for its purported $32bn business on QuickBooks software. Su Zhu, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that itself collapsed, said he used FTX after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125630d9-a967-439f-bc23-efec0b4cdeca\">seeing the roster of investors</a> behind it: “I assumed someone there did DD [due diligence].” Yet in an era when even Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f60b6385-eef6-461e-9fcc-b3cb999a70c6\">waived due diligence</a> before agreeing to buy Twitter for $44bn — from which he so far has little to show, beyond his demotion from the title of world's richest man — it is not unusual. </p> <p>Also not asking many questions were the Democratic politicians who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428c7800-c72d-4c59-9940-4376fea6e263\">received tens of millions of dollars</a> in FTX donations. Bankman-Fried liked to portray himself as crypto's friendly face who advocated, rather than eschewed, regulation — as a means of stifling competition, it turns out.</p> <p>Behind FTX's crypto babble and celebrity endorsements, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b62a2e86-ee61-4c4e-8ce3-418ae216d8a7\">prosecutors allege</a> a tale as old as time. John Ray, the restructuring expert who is FTX's new chief executive, calls it an “old-school” embezzlement. Bankman-Fried must be assumed innocent until proven guilty. But a less giddy approach to start-ups and their visionary founders ought in any case to emerge. One where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e739d9ed-b8ee-4d8e-ad29-0d01889d5775\">basic questions are asked</a> and where tried-and-tested aphorisms are kept in mind, not least: don't believe the hype. &#xa0;</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/c461153e-5588-44cd-a73d-cea30afaa05d.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: The editorial board 2022 'The cautionary tale of FTX' FT.com 14 December.
