  "text": "<p>Gains for the Nasdaq came amid an otherwise bumpy session for U.S. stocks, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average swinging between small gains and losses throughout the day. The S&amp;P 500 ultimately eked out a gain to finish at a record, rising 1.22 points, or less than 0.1%, to 3853.07.</p><p>The Dow fell 12.37 points, or less than 0.1%, to 31176.01.</p><p>Despite a turbulent start to 2021, U.S. stocks have largely continued to climb, with all three indexes up 1.9% or more year to date. The Nasdaq , in particular, has performed strongly, gaining 5% for the year, while the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks has risen 8.4%.</p><p>Driving some of those gains has been optimism that further economic recovery may be ahead under President Biden's new administration. Mr. Biden has called for a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan that includes direct payments to households and more money for testing and vaccine distribution. On Wednesday, the day that Mr. Biden took office, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow posted their best Inauguration Day performances since 1985, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in for his second term, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Better-than-expected earnings reports this season have also buoyed markets.</p><p>Still, the U.S. economy faces major obstacles, with data Thursday showing that about 900,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended Jan. 16, as companies continued to lay off workers amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p><p>Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic continues to loom large. The U.S. recorded 4,375 deaths for Wednesday, the second-highest daily number ever.</p><p>Analysts say those factors -- along with Netflix 's strong earnings this week -- have renewed investor interest for \"stay-at-home stocks\" that were popular for much of 2020. Apple gained $4.84, or 3.7%, to $136.87. Amazon.com added $43.61, or 1.3%, to $3,306.99.</p><p>\"You've got this rotation going on under the surface for a second day in a row where the small-cap stocks and the cyclical plays have been giving some back to the tech and stay-at-home areas,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial.</p><p>\"That's the lifeblood of a bull market -- to see a rotation,\" he added.</p><p>Traders this month have been examining earnings to see if they support the strong run across markets in recent months. Many investors are still betting on an economic recovery this year as Covid-19 vaccinations ramp up, increasing prospects for future earnings.</p><p>Earning results so far have been better than expected, and as of early Thursday afternoon, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies that have beat estimates hovered slightly below 90%, according to FactSet. Several companies have been rewarded by investors for the strong earnings results.</p><p>Shares of Travelers, one of the nation's biggest sellers of insurance to businesses and a top consumer-car insurer, climbed $3.70, or 2.6%, to $148.72 after reporting its net income surged in the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"Earnings season looks relatively good and seems to confirm this picture that the U.S. -- because there was no full lockdown -- did well in the fourth quarter,\" said Carsten Brzeski , ING Groep 's global head of macro research. \"Stock markets are really looking through the short-term outlook for the economy, which has worsened over recent days.\"</p><p>Investors are also paying close attention to corporate guidance in the sectors most affected by the pandemic. Shares of United Airlines fell $2.59, or 5.7%, to $42.59 after the airline said late Wednesday it expected the coronavirus to continue to weigh on travel demand this year.</p><p>In other corporate news, Ford Motor climbed 67 cents, or 6.2%, to $11.53, its highest close since June 2018. Shares of the company have jumped on upbeat analyst outlooks. Ford also holds a stake in electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive, which raised an additional $2.65 billion this week.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added less than 0.1% after the European Central Bank held steady on interest rates. Major indexes in Asia finished higher. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was down 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.7%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.3%.</p>",
