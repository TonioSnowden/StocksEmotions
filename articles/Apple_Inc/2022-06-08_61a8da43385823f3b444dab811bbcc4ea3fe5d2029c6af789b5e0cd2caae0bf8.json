  "text": "<p>Today's Auto File will focus on the vehicle industry's Big Three: Apple, Tesla and Walmart.</p><p>What companies did you think I meant?</p><p>It's a sunny morning in Detroit, but rain is on the way. Let's not waste a minute. Here we go -</p><p>* Here's the Apple Car, 1.0! Someday, Apple may build a car here  . But in the meantime, the maker of iPhones and eerie futuristic workplace dramas here   has unveiled the next generation of its CarPlay infotainment software, designed to run virtually every function on the big screen dashboards of tomorrow's cars. here   has unveiled the next generation of its CarPlay infotainment software, designed to run virtually every function on the big screen dashboards of tomorrow's cars.</p><p>Apple's new CarPlay would break out of the infotainment screen box here   power displays of speed, fuel consumption and other vehicle performance metrics. That requires reaching much more deeply into the functional systems of the car. Deeper integration into the car's vital systems could open the door to Apple autonomous driving, or Apple mobile commerce tools embedded in the car.</p><p>Google, developer of rival Android smartphone systems, is also pushing to get its technology integrated into cars, and has deals with General Motors and Renault-Nissan, among others here  .</p><p>All this presents a threat and an opportunity to established automakers.</p><p>The threat is that Apple (or Google or Amazon.com) will grab the value of the data generated by cars and drivers, and become the face of the car to consumers, displacing the automaker's brand. Auto industry executives have openly worried they will join Nokia and Motorola in the dustbin of industrial history here  .</p><p>The opportunity for automakers lies in negotiating deals that allow them to use smartphone industry technology to fix an urgent competitive problem.</p><p>Legacy automakers have largely failed to design user interfaces here  , voice recognition and connectivity systems that match the form and function of smartphones. Tesla and other new electric vehicle companies rooted in the digital tech industry have set new standards for vehicle software design and features, and customers know it.</p><p>As Ford, Cadillac, Mercedes, Toyota and the rest of the industry's legacy brands ready a new generation of vehicles for the middle of this decade, they must match the Tesla/Apple/Android standard or risk losing a generation of buyers.</p><p>This is why, for example, Mercedes-Benz has shown a Vision EQXX prototype future electric sedan with a 47.5-inches wide screen that sprawls from door to door. here   what software will power this awesome display? Mercedes is developing its own operating system. But what happens if when it comes to producing the EQXX it is clear CarPlay is better?</p><p>Apple listed Mercedes as one of the automotive brands \"excited\" about the new CarPlay.</p><p>Mercedes said \"we evaluate all potentially relevant new technologies and functions internally, and in this context we also hold discussions with Apple.\"</p><p>* Walmart and the Future of Trucking Walmart announced a flock of new deals to test alternatives here   to conventional, diesel-burning Class 8 trucks for hauling goods across its massive network of warehouses and stores.</p><p>Getting a pilot program with Walmart is for ZEV and autonomous trucking startups what getting a slot on the Colbert Late Show is for standup comics here   A gateway to the big time.</p><p>Earlier this week, autonomous truck startup Gatik expanded its test projects for Walmart with a deal to haul toilet paper and other Georgia-Pacific paper products to Sam's Club locations using self-driving, medium-duty trucks.</p><p>Walmart is also testing electric cars here  , electric vans here   !!GFN0sa3rsbfR8OLyAw!cdBwuEn1oLBURgBiAr_ys0k6IIVMRDl9EI_3v_NUBp- g4U_7zAINabseml5N3MkZxI97G4uZaIsM50X_Xfxu8oJczc7MxYY%24&amp;data=05% 7C01%7CJoe.White%40thomsonreuters.com%7C55723c9aeb8f41ad830208da 489f09db%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C6379021452 07973612%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2l uMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=KFp%2F OFXa%2BGH8%2F8ixJWlrelLNJVpnHLHyO9qda8%2FKjhg%3D&amp;reserved=0 and drones. here   !!GFN0sa3rsbfR8OLyAw!cdBwuEn1oLBURgBiAr_ys0k6IIVMRDl9EI_3v_NUBp- g4U_7zAINabseml5N3MkZxI97G4uZaIsM50X_Xfxu8oJcO_hD4Fs%24&amp;data=05% 7C01%7CJoe.White%40thomsonreuters.com%7C55723c9aeb8f41ad830208da 489f09db%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C6379021452 07973612%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2l uMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=CjDACe nWY2TcinGQN5IuCSC9dnhAIIwuxE2ZL%2FhnlFM%3D&amp;reserved=0</p><p>Are these new types of transportation ready for prime time? Not quite yet, Walmart says.</p><p>* Tesla Today Rarely a day goes by without something from Tesla and Elon Musk. On today's docket:</p><p>Chinese battery and EV maker BYD (Warren Buffett, prominent shareholder) here   said it will supply batteries to Tesla \"very soon.\"</p><p>Elon Musk's latest threats to scupper his proposed purchase of Twitter have stalled his bankers' efforts to put together financing that reduces the risk that Musk would have to sell Tesla shares. here   shares.</p><p>Tesla is getting ready to face California regulators here   have sued the company over alleged racial bias.</p><p>* Waymo allies with Uber Freight Waymo and Uber Freight said they have formed a \"long term\" partnership here   enable truck fleet operators using Waymo's self-driving Class 8 trucks to get cargo through Uber Freight's load matching service. The companies are testing the operation with Waymo Via's current, small development fleet. Scaling up will come when Waymo starts deploying a future fleet of self-driving Freightliners. Uber Freight has a prior deal with Aurora. here  .</p><p>* Didi looks at buying an EV maker Chinese ride-hailing company Didi is in talks to acquire a stake here   in a Chinese EV manufacturer, sources told Reuters. If a deal is done it would be another sign that Didi has escaped the Chinese government's penalty box. Ties to an EV producer could also give Didi a way to realize its ambitions to design vehicles specifically for its ride service. here   in a Chinese EV manufacturer, sources told Reuters.

Ties to an EV producer could also give Didi a way to realize its ambitions to design vehicles specifically for its ride service.</p><p>* Automakers back California on emissions The legal fight over whether California can set its own vehicle CO2 standards isn't over. The latest: Five automakers have joined the Biden Administration in supporting California's regulatory authority here   opposing a legal challenge brought by 17 Republican-led states. The Republican Attorneys General argue it is unconstitutional for California to have special regulatory powers.</p><p>* Minivans are hot! It is not your imagination: A lot of Millennials are having kids. And that appears to be reviving demand for minivans - a vehicle form left for dead by most mainstream automakers.</p><p>Prices for second-hand vans and minivans are up more than 27% in May compared to a year ago, here   to the latest Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index.</p><p>\"Minivans have been the hardest to find vehicles for a year,\" Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said. Production of Stellantis' Chrysler Pacifica and other minivans got hit by semiconductor shortages. Brands such as Chevrolet and Ford long ago ditched minivans in favor of SUVs.</p><p>But now, U.S. birth rates are rising, here   said. And when you're hoisting car seats and diaper bags, those sliding doors and big cargo bays can overcome fears of becoming your parents.</p><p>Also worth noting in the latest Manheim numbers: Used pickup truck prices are down. Smoke said the price drop is related to rising supplies of pickups, but he is reluctant to make the call that high gas prices are significantly cutting demand.</p><p>\"If you look at one segment that might be close to being oversupplied, it's full size pickups,\" Smoke said.</p><p>Farewell Boomers, welcome GenZennials! Honda has identified a hip, new demographic group it hopes will buy its vehicles: here   GenZennials. here   Honda is pitching its new HR-V compact SUV to this mash-up of 20 and 30-somethings. Honda's message for Boomers and Gen Xers: Please keep buying Accords and Pilots! Just don't tell anyone.</p><p>* Will the EU declare lithium a hazard? Lithium producer Albemarle said it could shut down a German processing facility here   for the critical battery material if European regulators declare certain lithium products to be hazardous materials. European policy makers also consider reducing reliance on China for EV battery materials a strategic imperative.</p><p>* Essential Reading Chinese consumers keep spending on lockdown here  </p><p>Europe orders smartphone makers to stop forcing consumers to buy new chargers. here  </p><p>Economists expect high inflation, slower growth. here  </p><p>* Auto File is published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
