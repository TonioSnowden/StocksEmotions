  "text": "<p>Corporate America and its largest investors are at odds over new regulations meant to “modernise” the way shareholders report their holdings.</p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission in February proposed new rules to increase transparency in stock markets by halving the 10-day window investors in the US currently have to reveal when they have built a stake of more than 5 per cent in a company.</p> <p>The rules would also broaden the definition of an investor “group” that is required to make the additional disclosures to include instances in which groups have not explicitly agreed to work together.</p> <p>Investors with smaller holdings also have to declare their positions if they are deemed to be working in concert with a group that has a combined ownership of more than 5 per cent — even absent an explicit agreement to work together.</p> <p>A comment period on the new rules, which closed this month, has revealed a stark difference of opinion between big business and the investment community over the proposals.</p> <p>Companies largely cheered the proposal as a victory and pushed for even more action, while investors warn of a logistical nightmare that will threaten many business models and imperil regular communications between investors.</p> <p>The Business Roundtable — one of the US's most influential corporate lobby groups, which counts the chief executives of General Motors, Apple and JPMorgan Chase among its board members — offered a full endorsement of the SEC's proposals. </p> <p>It said the changes would “significantly improve transparency and are appropriate in light of the many changes in technology and otherwise since the beneficial ownership reporting requirements were first put in place over 50 years ago”.</p> <p>It was joined by trade bodies representing corporate secretaries and investor relations professionals, individual companies such as Nasdaq, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, the law firm that invented the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0de89960-7cea-4fe2-bed2-54f221d5ba6d\">poison pill</a>” defence against hostile takeovers and specialises in defending companies against activists.</p> <p>FedEx general counsel Mark Allen wrote the SEC's proposals would help to “protect investors” and “maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets”. </p> <p>But its position is not shared by two of its largest active shareholders, T Rowe Price and Dodge &amp; Cox. “We think the SEC has significantly overstated the benefits of that reporting to long-term investors and underestimated the harm that it will have,” T Rowe said in its submission.</p> <p>Dodge &amp; Cox said the proposals “[strike] at the heart of our business” and would allow “free riders and predatory traders to profit from managers' work”. </p> <p>The so-called beneficial ownership proposals are part of new rules that have been put forward by the SEC in recent months under chair Gary Gensler, covering everything from money market funds to special purpose acquisition vehicles to how companies report about their impact on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9806361-c62d-40db-80d4-f51490709df5\">climate change</a>.</p> <p>Activist investors have begun exploring potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1809f070-6f51-4743-b3dd-233640c854e3\">legal options</a> to block related proposals on swaps markets, but the beneficial ownership rules have provoked a much broader opposition across the investment community, from hedge funds to the $4tn ETF specialist State Street.</p> <p>Bill Ackman's Pershing Square said the latest proposal “presents a rare occurrence as a serious problem, and proposes a sweeping and thoroughly disruptive solution that would harm market participants and issuers alike”.</p> <p>David Webber, professor at Boston University School of Law, said that while “more and earlier disclosure from hedge funds would be desirable”, if the proposal is adopted in its entirety, it would “sharply reduce shareholder activism from hedge funds and . . . diversified investors too, like pension funds”.</p> <p>He predicted the SEC would try to find a compromise as the divide “puts them in a position that I'm not sure they really want to be in”. </p> <p>“I think they are really concerned on the one hand to hear from companies who have to raise capital . . . On the other hand, the classic mission of investor protection is very much in their minds as well. And where to draw the line is never easy.”</p> <p>The SEC will consider the public comments as it drafts a final rule, which will then be put to a vote. </p> <p>The regulator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Source: Nicholas Megaw in New York and Stefania Palma in Washington 2022 'Corporate America and investors square off over SEC proposal' FT.com 25 April.
