  "text": "<p>When Apple TV Plus launched in autumn 2019, it promised to bring unique and powerful content from “the world's greatest storytellers”. But over the past two years, the platform's idea of what constitutes “the world” seems to have been limited to two non-anglophone originals and three international co-productions. None were particularly notable. </p> <p>Finally, with <em>Pachinko,</em> Apple TV Plus has delivered a series that is both global in scope and its most entrancing to date. Adapted from Min Jin Lee's bestselling novel, the new eight-part Korean family saga retains its literary texture. The detail is rich, the pacing deliberate, the characters complex and scenes are shot with a stillness that allows us to take in their beauty.</p> <p>Substance accompanies style. <em>Pachinko</em> chronicles a family's 70-year journey from a fishing town in Korea to a skyscraper in 1980s New York. Within that arc are several distinct but interlaced narratives that take in the brutal Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th-century, the erosion of identity experienced by first-generation migrants and the reverberations of history and trauma across eras and continents. &#xa0;</p> <p>With the past so deeply felt in the present, scenes set seven decades apart readily follow one another. The central character Sunja (who connects the four generations) exists simultaneously in this storytelling framework as a resilient, strong-minded youth (Minha Kim) and a similarly spirited old woman&#xa0;(<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e71e8e33-3aef-490b-9704-8dfd8799ee1b\"><em>Minari</em></a>'s Oscar-winner Youn Yuh-jung). The back-and-forth structure may initially be a little disorienting but it underlines how much has, and frequently hasn't, changed.</p> <p>The opening three episodes introduce two timelines. One focuses on Sunja's formative years under the shadow of colonial subjugation and her two first loves — her doting father and, later, the new director at the fish market, Koh Hansu (Lee Min-ho), a Gatsby-esque figure who has risen from poverty to benefit from Japanese rule. </p> <p>The second plotline concerns Sunja's grandson Solomon (Jin Ha), an Americanised businessman who returns to Japan in order to close a lucrative property development deal. Having spent his entire life as an outsider both in the US and Japan due to his Korean heritage, he finds solace in the stateless language of finance. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>An element of mystery is teased in a subplot involving the disappearance of a girl from Solomon's adolescence, but the real weight of <em>Pachinko </em>lies in its quieter moments. A Proustian scene in which a bowl of coarse Korean rice compels the older Sunja to reckon with all that she has left behind tells an entire story in just a few remarkable minutes. </p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>Episodes 1-3 on Apple TV Plus from March 25; new episodes released weekly thereafter</em>&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Korean family saga Pachinko is Apple's best show so far' FT.com 21 March.
