  "text": "<p>Next-Level GPS</p><p>Smartwatches' navigational smarts are notoriously imprecise. But it's increasingly common for new designs to feature support for \"multi-band\" GPS, which means your watch is tapping more positioning systems to locate itself than the original one deployed by the U.S. military in 1978. The Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar, for instance, uses this technology to support built-in topographical maps and a \"TracBack\" feature that lets you easily retrace your steps if you get lost, like a digital breadcrumb trail.</p><p>Perks for the Rugged</p><p>While the first generation of smartwatches might have mostly appealed to dorky cubicle denizens, extreme outdoor lifestyle features have become commonplace on recent releases. The Apple Watch Ultra is Cupertino's first smartwatch for those who spend more time trekking the great outdoors than staring at a MacBook. With a reimagined Compass app, emergency siren, red \"Night Mode\" display and up to 60 hours of battery life, the design is built to help wearers brave extreme environments and temperatures. With the Depth app, the Apple Watch Ultra can even track how deep you get underwater, whether you're swimming through coral reefs or just logging laps at your local Y.</p><p>Slumber Support</p><p>Tracking your sleep to ensure you're getting quality zzzs is the new \"did you hit 10,000 steps today?\" Beyond telling you how long you were in bed, some new smartwatches provide granular analysis on how much time you spent in each sleep stage (light, deep or REM) and whether you snored. Samsung's Galaxy Watch5 Pro offers the creme de la creme feature, \"Sleep Coaching,\" which delivers a detailed snapshot of your time in dreamland via an overhauled BioActive sensor that combines breathing-rate and heart-rate data. Using these biometrics, the watch provides a nightly score and a personalized sleep-coaching plan. Samsung even assigns you a \"sleep animal\" based on your shut-eye tendencies. And it might, for instance, help an \"Exhausted Shark\" morph into an \"Easygoing Walrus.\"</p><p>Solar Battery Charging</p><p>While digital watches have incorporated solar panels since the late 20th century (shout out to the Casio G-Shock, released back in 2009), early smartwatches rarely offered the feature. That's changed: Garmin released its first solar-powered GPS watch in 2019, and the tech is now available on models in several of its smartwatch lines. This year's Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar normally offers a substantial 18 days of battery life in smartwatch mode, with an additional 4 days when actively solar charging.</p><p>Advanced Health Monitoring</p><p>Health features on smartwatches are getting more robust. See: body-temperature sensors and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) that measures your body composition. To assess your stress level over time, the Fitbit Sense 2's new continuous electrodermal activity (cEDA) sensor monitors changes in your skin's sweat levels along with more typical measurements like heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. If the Sense 2 detects a \"body response,\" as Fitbit calls it, the watch prompts you to log your mood and take a walk or meditate to calm down. Among the watch's other health tools: an electrocardiogram app and an additional heart-monitoring algorithm -- both FDA cleared -- designed to track your heart health.</p><p>Intelligent Design</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch is so comfortable, it's like wearing nothing at all. That means you can sleep in it. We repeat: Sleep in your smartwatch without being annoyed. Though the tech giant still has to polish the software, its hotly anticipated first wearable is lightweight with rounded edges that don't snag on clothes. With a crisp, circular face, it blends analog style with a Silicon Valley aesthetic. As a bonus, the wide selection of bands makes it easy to dress the watch up or down.</p><p>Virtual Indestructibility</p><p>Come sleet, shocks or solar radiation, the latest smartwatches are built for the long haul. In the early days of smartwatchdom, replacing your fried fitness tracker every time you were caught in a thunderstorm seemed the norm. Now, these devices are practically run-over-with-a-tractor indestructible. A top ultra-durable pick: The Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra enshrouds its face with Corning Gorilla Glass to resist scratches and survive bumps and drops. It also meets U.S. Military Standard 810g levels of durability.</p>",
