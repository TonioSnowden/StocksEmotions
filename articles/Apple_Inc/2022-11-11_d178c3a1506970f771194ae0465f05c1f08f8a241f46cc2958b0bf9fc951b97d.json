  "text": "<p>Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>Tech giants are going to be less giant as they prepare for a possible recession. Meta on Wednesday announced layoffs of more than 11,000 workers, or 13% of staff, as the Facebook parent tried to cope with a digital-ad market slump. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. has launched a cost-cutting review, focusing on unprofitable business units during a slowdown of its core retail business. As part of the review, Amazon has told employees in some unprofitable divisions to look for jobs elsewhere in the company because their current teams were being suspended or closed. Meta shares gained 5.2% Wednesday.</p><p>Walt Disney Co.</p><p>The plot driving Disney's streaming business is becoming more complicated. The company's flagship streaming service added 12.1 million new subscribers in the latest quarter, but the division lost $1.47 billion, more than twice the year-earlier loss. Disney faces a balancing act, spending enough on popular shows and movies to attract new users while reining in costs so the business can break even. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said coming changes will help stem losses: price increases to some Disney+ packages and a new ad-supported subscription tier that will compete with a similar product launched by Netflix Inc. Disney shares sank 13% Wednesday.</p><p>Tesla Inc.</p><p>The world's richest person went on another selling spree after buying Twitter Inc. Elon Musk sold almost $4 billion in Tesla stock after his $44 billion purchase of Twitter closed. He has sold more than $19 billion of the electric-vehicle maker's stock this year. Mr. Musk is on the hook for $33.5 billion in equity financing to pay for the Twitter deal, and his takeover has been bumpy. After initiating layoffs of half the company's staff, Mr. Musk tweeted that the company was losing $4 million a day. Tesla shares lost 7.2% Wednesday.</p><p>Adidas AG</p><p>Adidas is ditching Ye, but keeping the Yeezys. The sporting-goods company said it would sell shoes based on the Yeezy designs under another name, despite scrapping its collaboration with the rapper Kanye West, who goes by Ye. Adidas ended the Yeezy venture with Mr. West following controversies including a recent anti-Semitic outburst by the artist. Finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said that the brand was the sole owner of all rights to existing products except the Yeezy name, and that the company intended to make use of those rights as early as 2023. U.S.-traded shares of Adidas rose 3.3% Wednesday.</p><p>Lyft Inc.</p><p>Lyft is losing speed. The ride-sharing app posted slowing revenue growth and weak ridership numbers in the latest quarter. The company ended the quarter with 20.31 million riders, fewer than analysts had predicted and still below the 23 million it had in the quarter before the pandemic struck. The disappointing numbers overshadowed the increase in revenue that Lyft made per rider, after a yearlong driver shortage pushed ride prices to record highs. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies Inc. said on Nov. 1 that its rider count had bounced back to prepandemic levels. Lyft shares plummeted 23% Tuesday.</p><p>Apple Inc.</p><p>Apple's major iPhone maker is answering the call. Days after Apple said its iPhone Pro shipments would be lower than expected because of supply disruptions, the chief executive of Foxconn Technology Group said the supplier aims to bring production levels back to normal at its main iPhone factory in China. Foxconn has struggled to contain a Covid outbreak that began in October. As fear of the virus grew, scores of workers were filmed fleeing the plant. The site still operates under a bubblelike closed-loop system, with workers only allowed to move between on-site lodging and production lines. Apple shares gained 8.9% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Coinbase, Meta, Disney: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
