  "text": "<p>Equities prices have remained on a steady upward march for nearly a year despite all the problems and uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 20% this year, up 40% from its 52-week low last September, and hasn't seen a drop of 5% or more since last November.</p><p>The index rose every month between February and August, its longest such streak since 2018. It has set 53 highs this year.</p><p>History cautions against betting too heavily on the rally continuing. In years when the S&amp;P 500 rose at least 20% through August, the index averaged a decline of 2% for the rest of the year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Where stocks go nextwill depend on the economy and Federal Reserve. Weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, dropped to 340,000, reaching a pandemic low. The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $70.1 billion in July as American consumers shifted spending toward in-person services and away from goods.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.293% from 1.301% on Wednesday.</p><p>Stocks have pushed higher this week as investors weighed strong corporate earnings and low interest rates against indicators that growth may be slowing in some parts of the world. Money managers are awaiting the jobs report for August, due Friday, for more clues on when and how the Fed may taper bond purchases</p><p>\"The confluence of a strong recovery at the same time as very low interest rates and maybe the peak of policy accommodation: If you put those all together, it is a very powerful mix for risky assets,\" said Bill Papadakis, macro economist at Lombard Odier. \"If you consider the alternatives in which investors could put their money today -- with interest rates where they are -- equities are often the one option for somewhat better returns.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, ADP said the private sector created 374,000 jobs in August, below expectations.</p><p>That could be a warning sign for Friday's government jobs report. A weaker economy complicates the Fed's timeline for raising rates, said Ava Trade analyst Naeem Aslam.</p><p>\"Investors are considering bad news as good because the economy not recovering quickly may convince the Fed to stick to its soft-money stance,\" he said.</p><p>One corner of the market that has cooled significantly are SPAC stocks.</p><p>A broad selloff has wiped about $75 billion off the value of companies that came public through special-purpose acquisition companies, according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of figures from SPAC Research.</p><p>Among corporate stocks, Spotify rose 6.6% to $254.03. Apple said it would allow media apps such as the music-streaming service to link to their own websites for payment, taking down restrictions criticized as anticompetitive.</p><p>Oil prices rose a day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies agreed to continue increasing oil production.</p><p>U.S. crude gained 2% to $69.99 a barrel, lifted by lower-than-expected inventories, according to analysts.</p><p>The price of bitcoin touched $50,000 on Thursday morning, after a strong run in August. But similar to the past week, it struggled to get over the mark and at 5 p.m traded at $49,555.55. Shares in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global added 0.9% to $268.18.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.4% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.7%.
