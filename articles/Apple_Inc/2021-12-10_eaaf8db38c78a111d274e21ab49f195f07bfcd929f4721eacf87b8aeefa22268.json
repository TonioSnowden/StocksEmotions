  "title": "Tom Ford on Eating Sugary Treats for Breakfast; The provocative, perfection-driven fashion designer on turning 60, publishing a new book and adjusting to being a single father following the loss of his husband, Richard Buckley.",
  "text": "<p>Ford was born in Austin, Texas, and grew up in the Houston suburbs and Santa Fe. At Gucci and YSL, he gained a reputation for understanding that sex sells, with provocative ad campaigns and no-holds-barred interviews. Today he is based in Los Angeles, where he helms the Tom Ford brand and serves as the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America while living a quieter life with Jack.</p><p>In September, less than a month after Ford's 60th birthday, he lost his husband and partner of 35 years, the fashion journalist Richard Buckley. Putting his new book together has made him more reflective. \"It causes you to look at how much time you've had on the planet, how much time you have in the future, what you've accomplished, what you want to accomplish,\" he says. Which isn't to say he's completely changed his rule about not lingering on the past. \"I thought, OK, I'll capture this time period, put that in a slipcover and move on and create the next chapter,\" he says. \"I'm someone who likes to tie things up and put a bow around them.\"</p><p>What time do you get up on Monday? What's the first thing you do?</p><p>I get up at 5:30. I make myself an iced coffee. At least four days a week, I go down to the small gym in my house. I turn on CNN or MSNBC and run on the treadmill and do some push-ups and sit-ups. I don't use weights, but I do body-resistance things, and I don'tdo that for that long, maybe a half hour. Then I go upstairs and I lie in a hot bath with a second coffee. And sometimes time just goes so fast, and I realize I've been lying there for half an hour. I get up that early so I can have peace and quiet before I get Jack up to goto school. I've noticed that sometimes if he jumps up early and I don't have that time in the bathtub to just think in the mornings, I'm not together all day long. I can really feel it.</p><p>How do Jack's morning routines compare to yours?</p><p>They definitely overlap with mine. Until recently, I had Richard to help me out in the mornings. It's been a little bit of a struggle the last month because he would normally get [Jack's] breakfast on school days while I was getting dressed. I've gotten pretty good at it.I guess I've added now to my routine at 5:30…. But it's a challenge to get him up, dressed, get his lunch made, get his lunch packed, get his breakfast done, get all my things done, and then I drive him to school at 7:45. But it also means I'm at my office by 8:10, so I get a good start to the day.</p><p>When it comes to sleep, how many hours do you generally need?</p><p>Between three and five. Often three—I go to bed at about 11:30, and for some reason, I wake up at about 3, 3:10. If my mind starts wandering, then that's it. I might as well get up.</p><p>Do you have a go-to breakfast?</p><p>It's always a carb. It can be a handful of vanilla wafers. It can be some other sort of cookie. It can be a doughnut, a piece of cake.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>I do. I go through periods, which is probably stupid, where I take more vitamins than I do now. Right now I'm just taking a multivitamin, but I have vitamin B12 and vitamin C, ascorbic acid…. I have probably 20 different vitamins in my drawer, and at certain times I open the drawer, stare at it—this is probably completely silly—and I'll feel like, Oh, I haven't been out in the sun, I need a vitamin D. Or, I have a bit of a sore throat, I'm going to take a vitamin C. Or, Oh, I feel weak and I'm a man and I'm getting older, maybe I need a DHEA. And then at times, I've been on a much stricter vitamin regimen.</p><p>What's your skin-care and/or beauty routine like?</p><p>Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. That's the key to youth. It's pretty easy, really, because when you wash your face [with] a good old-fashioned washcloth when you're in the bathtub, you can really exfoliate. And then when I dry myself off with a towel all over my entire body, I don't think I could rub myself any harder. And, you know, moisturize, the usual things. I trim my beard; I don't shave, so I don't have that skin problem.</p><p>Is there a time of the day or week when you're most creative?</p><p>In terms of being on and having my brain really going, I'm a morning person. I used to have a drinking problem, and in that period of my life, I was more of an evening person. But that has completely reversed. And maybe it's also living in California. You know, everyone in California gets up early. If you're invited to a dinner party, it's at 7 o'clock. When I lived in Europe, I thought that was so strange. You didn't eat until 9 in Italy and maybe 8 or 8:30 in London. So that took me a while. But I have found just living in L.A., life here is so much about your family and so much about being outdoors, and everyone gets up quite early, eats quite early, goes to bed quite early.</p><p>What was the process of curating the images in your new book like?</p><p>I had thousands and thousands and thousands. It was so hard to cull those down, and I did it in a very rapid way. When I go through images, it's sort of like, OK, that one speaks, throw it aside, keep going, keep going, keep going; OK, that one does, throw it aside. That's the way I work with everything. Often I find first impressions are the most powerful or resonate the most even when you go back and look at them. There's something in the image that captures you…. It brings up a lot of memories and is cathartic in some ways or certainly contemplative.</p><p>You talk in the book about how you love trying to correct imperfection. At what point in the creative process do you know you've achieved that?</p><p>I tweak and tweak and tweak. And then finally, it's like, Yes, that's right. That's right. And that's always a good feeling, because always at the beginning of working on a collection, I think, Oh, my God, what am I going to do? This is terrible. It's never going to work. And then you keep working on it and you get to a place where you feel good about it, most of the time.</p><p>Sometimes you look back and you think, Oh, that was a terrible collection, and you realize you know why or what you were thinking at the time or what was happening in your life that made it that way. So there have been a couple of terrible collections. I've left them out of the book. That's the nice thing about a book. You can edit what you did and leave out the things that didn't work.</p><p>Are there things that you do outside of dressing to maintain elegance in your day-to-day life?</p><p>I think I am, by nature, a more formal, old-fashioned person. You know, the other day working on responding to condolence notes and everything, I said to my L.A. assistant, \"Get out Emily Post.\" She said, \"What is Emily Post?\" I said, \"What do you mean, 'What is Emily Post?' Get out a copy of Emily Post! Look at etiquette and see how we respond to emails.\"</p><p>I mean, people in L.A., when you have a dinner party, the one thing I do not understand that drives me insane is couples want to sit next to each other. For me, the whole point is that you sit next to someone new, so when you go home and get into bed, you can dish about them. So manners in L.A. have taken me a while to adjust to. You know, I don't let Jack wear shorts to school, and the other kids are in shorts. On the one hand, I feel that maybe I have to give into it just because I don't want him to be ostracized because he doesn't have on shorts. But I'll say to him, \"You're never wearing shorts to school. Don't ask again. Not happening. When you turn 18, you can wear whatever you want.\" It was only recently that I let him wear T-shirts with stuff printed on it.</p><p>Your sense of humor informs your work. How do you define it? What's funny to you?</p><p>My sense of humor is evil. It's wicked. I mostly cannot actually express my real sense of humor. People who work with me are very aware of it. I have to temper it before I put it out into the outside world. I can rarely express my true sense of humor. I got that from my family. My father was incredibly sarcastic and my mother as well, and we had dinner every night at the dining table. We were all expected to talk. And basically, that's what we did. It was just sarcastic and cynical, and we made each other laugh. We were wicked.</p><p>What's one piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>Never take no for an answer. Ever. I hate plan Bs. I hate when people start a conversation and they say, \"Plan A is this and plan B is that.\" No, there's no plan B.</p><p>Thank you for your time, and I'm so sorry about the loss of Richard.</p><p>Thank you. It's been hard after 35 years, very hard. I keep thinking, Oh, God, I have to call Richard, or I need to send him a note about this. And he's not here.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>5 Monday Must-Haves</p><p>Bronzer</p><p>\"I don't go out in the sun. When I was a kid growing up in Texas, we used to just lie by the pool six hours a day with music and cover ourselves in Hawaiian Tropic, no sunscreen.\"</p><p>iPhone 13 Pro</p><p>\"I lie in the bathtub with my phone. I have never dropped it in.\"</p><p>Iced coffee</p><p>\"Before anything, I have to have coffee. I only drink iced coffee. I never drink anything hot. Maybe that's from growing up in Texas.\"</p><p>Baths</p><p>\"I take at minimum two baths a day. That's my meditation. I can spend an hour just lying there.\"</p><p>Sugar</p><p>\"On the edge of my tub, I lay the remote control to the television, my eyeglasses, coffee and usually some sort of sweet carbohydrate.\"</p><p>Tom Ford on Eating Sugary Treats for Breakfast</p>",
