Similarly, 11 of the 20 districts where Republicans have made the greatest percentage gains now have Republican congressmen, although only five have a solidly Republican heritage. </p><p>\n  The partisan strife of the last decade has failed to produce either [a] Democratic majority [or] the less-frequently-projected MAGA nation. But it has shown both parties capable of adapting to unforeseen challenges. And it has produced the most robust voter turnout in more than a century. </p><p></p>",
