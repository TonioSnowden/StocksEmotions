  "title": "Adnan Syed Murder Charges Dropped by Baltimore Prosecutors; Prosecutor says new DNA evidence excludes Syed from the murder of Hae Min Lee",
  "text": "<p>\"It is my responsibility to acknowledge and apologize to the family of Hae Min Lee and Adnan Syed,\" Ms. Mosby said during a news conference, noting that her administration didn't handle the original prosecution.</p><p>Ms. Mosby said her office notified the lawyer representing the Lee family on Tuesday.</p><p>However, Steve Kelly, a lawyer for the Lee family, said the family learned of the decision to drop the case against Mr. Syed through the media.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Did you listen to 'Serial' and follow this case? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"By rushing to dismiss the criminal charges, the state's attorney's office sought to silence Hae Min Lee's family and to prevent the family and the public from understanding why the state so abruptly changed its position of more than 20 years,\" Mr. Kelly said in a statement. \"All this family ever wanted was answers and a voice. Today's actions robbed them of both.\"</p><p>Erica Suter, a lawyer for Mr. Syed, said the DNA results confirmed Mr. Syed's innocence.</p><p>\"Today is a day that Adnan Syed and his loved ones have been waiting for for 23 long years,\" Ms. Suter said during a news conference. Mr. Syed's conviction was vacated in September.</p><p>Ms. Suter said Mr. Syed will soon file a motion in court to certify his innocence. She declined to say whether he will pursue compensation for wrongful conviction.</p><p>Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 for the murder of Ms. Lee, an 18-year-old high-school student and his ex-girlfriend. Mr. Syed, who was 17 years old at the time of her death, was charged as an adult. He had been serving a life sentence at the Patuxent Institution, a state prison in Jessup, Md., according to state records.</p><p>The first season of \"Serial\" in 2014 and a 2019 HBO docuseries focused on Ms. Lee's murder and examined Mr. Syed's relationship with her. The media coverage brought attention to his case and spurred attempts to set him free.</p><p>Maryland's highest court reversed a decision in 2019 by a lower court that found that Mr. Syed should get a new trial. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal of that 2019 decision.</p><p>In March, the Baltimore state's attorney's office and Mr. Syed's attorneys requested that Ms. Lee's clothing be tested with DNA technology that wasn't available in 1999.</p><p>A Baltimore Circuit judge vacated Mr. Syed's murder conviction in September after prosecutors said new evidence suggested there were two suspects who may have been involved in Ms. Lee's death, including one who had told someone he would make her disappear. The suspects weren't properly ruled out during the first investigation, prosecutors said.</p><p>Judge Melissa Phinn had ordered Mr. Syed to be released under home detention and said the state would have 30 days to set a new trial date, should they choose to.</p><p>The Lee family objected to the vacating of Mr. Syed's conviction and filed an appeal with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. The family asked the Court of Special Appeals to halt proceedings in the lower court while the Lee family's appeal was considered.</p><p>The Maryland Attorney General's Office also filed a motion asking the Court of Special Appeals to stay the case in the lower court.</p><p>The Maryland Attorney General's Office declined to comment Tuesday.</p><p>Ms. Suter said the Court of Special Appeals hasn't dismissed the case. She is waiting to see what action the court proposes now, she said.</p><p>When asked about the appeal, Ms. Mosby said the case was moot because her office has declined to prosecute Mr. Syed.</p><p>\"The case is over,\" Ms. Mosby said.</p><p>After Mr. Syed's conviction was vacated, \"Serial\" rose to the top of Apple Inc.'s list of podcasts in the U.S. The podcast released a new episode titled \"Adnan Is Out,\" eight years after the show made its debut.</p><p>Now that the Baltimore state's attorney's office has declined to prosecute Mr. Syed, his home detention has also ended, Ms. Suter said.</p><p>She said Mr. Syed, who is pursuing a college degree and hopes to go to law school, will spend Tuesday with his family.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>The Case of Adnan Syed</p><p>* 'Serial' Rises on Podcast Charts After Adnan Syed Conviction Is Vacated (Sept. 20)</p><p>* Adnan Syed Released From Prison After Judge Vacates Murder Conviction (Sept. 19)</p><p>* Adnan Syed Murder Conviction Should Be Vacated, Prosecutors Say (Sept. 14)</p><p>* New DNA Testing Requested in Murder Case at Center of First 'Serial' Podcast (March 10)</p><p>* How We Reinvestigated the 'Serial' Murder for HBO (March 11, 2019)</p><p>Adnan Syed Murder Charges Dropped by Baltimore Prosecutors</p>",
