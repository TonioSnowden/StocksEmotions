  "text": "<p>On a warm Arkansan evening, a jazz quartet has drawn a crowd outside Walton's five and dime in the main square. It's been 60 years since Sam Walton expanded from this small shop to open the first Walmart discount store nearby, and 30 years since he died. But “Mr Sam” and his company still dominate Bentonville. There's one of its Neighborhood Market shops a block away, an outdoor clothing outlet in the other direction and a giant Supercenter just across Walton Boulevard. Even the throwback soda fountain next to Walton's has been subsumed by the Walmart museum, which is funding tonight's entertainment.</p> <p>In the audience, a boy is riding a coin-operated truck, a model of the beaten-up Ford pick-up that helped cement Walton's image as a frugal, quail-hunting man of the people even as he became America's richest individual. A replica greeted me at the local airport, and the original is in the museum. Walking through the old shop to see it, I&#xa0;find books of Walton's folksy business wisdom, the moon pies he once sold 500,000 of in a week by cutting their price and T-shirts bearing the truck's image. At just $5, I can't say no.</p> <p>Walton's understanding of our inability to resist a bargain built the empire that now employs 2.3mn people, stretches from India to South Africa and commands a market value of roughly $350bn. His&#xa0;drive to offer irresistible deals relied on a business model that kept wages at a minimum, sourced products from the world's cheapest suppliers and was hostile towards investing in anything that would not sell another T-shirt or moon pie. Squeezing costs to lower prices for consumers was Walton's definition of purpose. “Our vendors resented us for prying the lowest prices out of them,” he wrote in his memoir, but “our philosophy . . . has been simple: we are the agents for our customers.”</p> <p>The expectations placed on today's business leaders are less straightforward. Employees, customers, investors and activists are pressing them to use their heft to solve the very social and environmental problems some blame them for creating. In place of the focus on shareholder returns that drove Sam Walton's generation, America's biggest industry groups have pledged themselves to “stakeholder capitalism”, the notion that they can be a force for good by serving all of their constituencies equally. Soon after the Business Roundtable, the powerful lobbying group, committed itself to that goal in 2019, it announced a new chair: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4a210ea8-7a54-4681-8a3b-b4ed2b7f7038\">Walmart</a> chief executive Doug&#xa0;McMillon. </p> <p>Over the past year, scepticism about this definition of corporate responsibility has grown rapidly. “The Bully of Bentonville”, as one 2006 book dubbed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a072d958-10cb-4f60-a8f2-00df0bc8d34d\">Walmart</a>, has always faced criticism from those on the left who mistrust big business and bridle at its efforts to crush unions. Now influential voices on the right have joined them, claiming that corporate America is pushing a radical progressive ideology. “Corporate power has increasingly been utilised to impose an ideological agenda on the American people through the perversion of financial investment priorities under the euphemistic banners of environmental, social and corporate governance and diversity, inclusion and equity,” Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis charged in August. The rightwing pundit Dinesh D'Souza put it more bluntly: “Walmart has gone woke”.</p> <p>I first came to Bentonville in 1999, when Walmart bid for the UK's Asda grocery chain. I hurried down from the Financial Times's New York office to work out how this retail Goliath might upend Britain's supermarkets. Even then, politicians were worrying about its market clout. It has only grown more powerful since, reshaping not only its own industry but every business that supplies it. One CEO whose company does business with Walmart told me that when he got his job, he spent his first day introducing himself to employees and days two and three in Bentonville. Most large Walmart suppliers have felt the need to open offices here.</p> <p>Walmart was big in 1999, but it has four times the revenues now. As it expanded — to 24 countries, from China to Mexico — so has its hometown. Bentonville's population of 57,000 is almost three times larger than when I was last here. One in six residents is foreign-born, and its housing market has been among the fastest growing in the country. The cultural transformation of this corner of a state where 62 per cent of voters picked Donald Trump in 2020 is even more striking. Local schools now teach the International Baccalaureate; Pride flags flutter over suburban picket fences; the farmers' market sells CBD products (“for humans and dogs”); and three local restaurants have been shortlisted for coveted James Beard awards. The confederate monument that the five and dime once overlooked was removed two years ago.</p> <p>These changes are nothing compared to Walmart's plans for the world beyond Bentonville. Amazon outstrips its market value, but Walmart remains the world's largest company when measured by last year's $572bn revenues. Its US sales alone work out to $3,000 per household. Put simply, nobody sells more stuff, which means that the decisions Walmart makes about the products it buys and the people who source and ship them have an unparalleled impact. There is no bigger example of how corporate power is shaping the world around us. One question hangs over Bentonville as Walmart tries to prove that it can use its power to improve the world: is it for real?</p> <p><strong>Doug McMillon joined Walmart</strong> 23 years before he became CEO in 2014, starting as an assistant buyer for fishing tackle. On his first day, he found a Post-it note on his desk, complaining that rival Kmart sold cheaper fishing line. The handwriting was Walton's.</p> <p>These days, a different kind of message comes down from Walmart's leader. In 2020, with the US struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic and confronting its racial divisions after the murder of George Floyd, McMillon gave a speech about Walmart's purpose and legacy. In 15 years of trying to operate more sustainably, it had made progress, he said, but not enough. Walmart must become not just sustainable but regenerative. What that meant, he explained, was a company “dedicated to placing nature and humanity at the centre of our business practices”, replenishing resources rather than just conserving them. It would have to eliminate more carbon emissions and waste, promote prosperity and equity for customers, staff and suppliers, and enforce less-harmful practices down through the world's largest supply chain. Its mission, McMillon has said, is to make the world a better place. (McMillon declined to comment for this story.)</p> <p>These are the things that big companies prefer to discuss rather than, say, why they buy from Chinese suppliers instead of American ones, why they fight unionisation, why their CEOs earn 1,000 times more than a typical employee or whether we should all just consume less. And, under McMillon, Walmart has not been shy about promoting its efforts to do better. Its ads boast of how many hourly “associates” it promoted last year and how generous its college tuition coverage is. It also pumps out annual ESG reports, short for environmental, social and governance, as well as “journey to sustainability” reports and “culture, diversity, equity and inclusion” reports. Reading them shows the extraordinary range of issues on which companies are now expected to have a position. Walmart, they reveal, worries about lightbulbs, refrigerants, soil erosion, systemic racism, plastic bags, gun violence, financial literacy, vaccine distribution, disaster preparedness, recidivism rates, cashew yields in Ghana and shark stocks in New Caledonia. </p> <p>On any given day, the company's representatives might be talking tuna with Marshall Islands leaders, helping the Rappahannock tribe reclaim ancestral land in Virginia or working with “bee relocation experts” to humanely move hives from its stores. The reports offer countless statistics: Walmart gave 696mn lb of food to the hungry last year, 39 per cent of its US management are people of colour and 88 per cent of its pineapples are sourced sustainably. </p> <p>The person in charge of this dizzying agenda is Kathleen McLaughlin, a former Rhodes scholar and theology student who once envisioned a career doing development work in Africa. Instead, she spent more than 20 years as a McKinsey consultant, before becoming Walmart's chief sustainability officer. A storm has stranded her in a Chicago hotel, so I talk to her via video conference from Walmart's “home office”, the frills-free Bentonville headquarters that sits beside the cemetery where Walton is buried. Judging by the curtains, bland lamps and control panel light flashing behind her, McLaughlin's employer has maintained Walton's penny-pinching approach to business travel. </p> <p>As&#xa0;she sips from a polystyrene coffee cup, I ask what brought her to Walmart back in 2013. “I flew down to Arkansas really out of curiosity. I thought it might just be a one-day field trip,” she says. But McMillon and his colleagues sold her on the idea that she could advance a social and environmental agenda she cared about while furthering Walmart's commercial interests. “It seemed like a place where I could work with others to make a difference.”</p> <p>That “shared value creation” approach, which McLaughlin paraphrases as meaning that businesses should “create wealth for society in the broadest sense”, lies behind Walmart's splashiest environmental initiative, Project Gigaton, a 2017 pledge to remove 1bn metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its supply chain by 2030. For comparison, that is as much as Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, signed this summer, aims to cut by the same date. </p> <p>Early on, small vendors were unconvinced. “We had some suppliers come up to us and say, ‘we don't think this is relevant for us because we don't have any greenhouses,'” McLaughlin tells me. Five years and 574mn metric tons of avoided emissions later, 4,500 suppliers accounting for more than 70 per cent of Walmart's sales have signed up, making Project Gigaton the largest private sector initiative of its kind.</p> <p>McLaughlin has a second role running the philanthropic Walmart Foundation, which last year handed out $1.5bn in cash and in-kind contributions. But she insists that such initiatives are not charity. Walmart's risk assessments have convinced it that a “business as usual” scenario that lets global temperatures rise by more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels would endanger supplies of its most vital commodities. In some scenarios, she tells me, “coffee doesn't exist”. </p> <p>Climate change means higher energy costs for customers, she adds, plus “expensive disasters” such as hurricanes and floods. The more costly life becomes, the less shoppers can spend at Walmart. As the company tries to eliminate its own emissions by 2040, it has installed solar panels on store roofs, fuelled forklifts with liquid hydrogen and begun piloting electric alternatives to diesel-powered trucks.</p> <p>The 18-wheelers the company wants to replace are immortalised in a painting that hangs in a corridor of the Bentonville headquarters. It shows 13 Walmart-branded vehicles stopped at a police checkpoint on their way to deliver supplies to New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, the storm that devastated the city in 2005. It is an image of the corporate cavalry coming to the rescue while federal authorities faltered. The trucks, loaded with generators and bottled water, arrived before the relief organised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “It was a moment where people sharply experienced the difference that we could make,” McLaughlin says. It also changed how the company thought about the business case for social and environmental responsibility.</p> <p>Lee Scott, Walmart's CEO at the time, recalled the welcome employees received in New Orleans in a speech soon after: “What would it take for Walmart to be that company, at our best, all the time?” What if it used the very size that people criticised it for to become “a trusted friend”, making the world a better place? Few observers expected such a rallying cry from Walmart, but it came with a Waltonesque case for saving the planet. Using less packaging on just one brand of toys could save $2.4mn a year, Scott observed.</p> <p>Down a corridor, through a maze of grey cubicles, I am given a show-and-tell to explain how McMillon's team has expanded on Scott's vision. Jane Ewing, senior vice-president for sustainability, sits in a room decorated with the iconography of corporate sustainability — a wind turbine, a bicycle, a lightbulb and a bee. She explains the strategies behind the dolphin-friendly tuna and the pollinator-friendly plant that sits on the table between us and then hands me two pairs of pruning clippers. One is encased in a plastic blister pack; the other is tied to its cardboard backing by two tags. Walmart will save “tons” of plastic by changing this one product's packaging, she explains. It is working with every supplier to try to replicate those savings.</p> <p>The picture that inspired Scott's post-Katrina rethink also hangs in Walmart's emergency operations centre, the windowless bunker from which Walmart co-ordinated its response to a shooting in El Paso, riots in KwaZulu-Natal and successive Covid-19 outbreaks. On the day I visit, 357 Walmart facilities are on flood watch after torrential rains in Kentucky. Green and red dots on a digital map pinpoint its properties in the flood zone. My guide clicks on one and live security camera footage appears. He presses another button and the screen fills with yellow dots. There is one for every employee's home. Managers must account for each associate, driving door to door if&#xa0;needed. </p> <p>It's a well-rehearsed drill. Every few days, there's a flood, a hurricane or an ice storm for the bunker to respond to. In September, Walmart and its foundation pledged $6mn for recovery efforts after Hurricane Ian devastated Florida, closing more than 260 of its facilities — reminders of the costs of a changing climate and the business case for doing something about it.</p> <p><strong>In the decade that followed </strong>Scott's 2005 speech, Walmart's role as the main villain in American capitalism, at least on the left, waned as big tech firms including Amazon and Facebook grew more powerful. Something else happened: Walmart began winning over some of the critics it once repelled.</p> <p>Julie Gehrki studied at Arkansas's Clinton School of Public Service, thinking that a career in government or aid was her best chance of making “scale change” in the world. She had “zero interest” in working for large companies, she says. After her dean pushed her to send a CV to Walmart,&#xa0; Gehrki came to Bentonville to practise her interviewing skills. She was converted. Now vice-president of philanthropy at Walmart.org, which co-ordinates the charitable efforts of the company and its foundation, Gehrki has helped launch a $100mn racial equity centre, brought healthier foods to communities across the US and opened 200 academies to teach retail employees new skills. After 14 years, she says: “I still come to work every day thinking this is the highest-impact job for me to spend my time on.”</p> <p>It is a refrain I hear repeatedly on my tour of executives: that they never planned to end up at Walmart until they saw what they could do with its resources. </p> <p>I find another convert after driving past the 350-acre site where bike trails and sustainable timber buildings are taking shape on the new campus which Walmart will move to next year. In the 1990s, Brandon Carson, now Walmart's vice-president of learning and leadership, thought that the retailer was “almost like the Amazon of today” in how it treated people. He was won over by the opportunity to apply his ideas about retraining workers and removing barriers for under-represented groups to a workforce of 2.3mn people. Carson had worked at Delta Air Lines, Microsoft and Apple. None had Walmart's scale. “Right now,” he says, “we have the corporate world's largest skilling ecosystem.” </p> <p>More surprising than the number of converts among Walmart's executives is discovering how many non-governmental organisations have seen Walmart's power and decided that they like it too. The Environmental Defense Fund, for example, used to be known for splashy lawsuits hauling big businesses to court. Now it has an office in Bentonville and works with Walmart on issues such as eliminating toxic chemicals and improving fertiliser efficiency. (The Walton family is a donor.) “We were looking for . . . who has big leverage,” says Katie Anderson, who directs food and forestry programmes at its EDF+Business arm. It is an unlikely partnership, she admits, but “when the world's largest retailer asks to engage suppliers, they listen”.</p> <p>It is hard to keep track of all of Walmart's NGO alliances. In another, the World Wide Fund for Nature joined it in a $6mn initiative two years ago to restore 1mn acres of grazing land in the Great Plains. “Walmart's superpower is its ability to move its supply chain,” says Sheila Bonini, WWF's senior vice-president for private sector engagement. “Nobody else is going to have that impact.”</p> <p>There is one issue on which Walmart has failed to silence critics: How much its retail employees should earn. According to a 2020 study by the Government Accountability Office, no other US company employs more people who are on some form of federal assistance, such as food stamps. “If you work for the richest company in history, you shouldn't qualify for welfare,” argues Walmart's leading union antagonist, the UFCW.</p> <p>McMillon has made efforts to change that, setting a $9 floor for hourly wages in 2015 when some US associates were still earning the $7.25 federal minimum. On the day Walmart spelt out the cost of doing so, its stock fell 10 per cent. The company announced more raises last year; Wall Street punished it again. Walmart's minimum wage is now $12, below Amazon's $15 baseline, though it prefers to emphasise an hourly average that now exceeds $17. “There is a path of opportunity for everyone,” McMillon told associates this summer, saying the company wanted to provide a mix of wages, benefits and opportunities for advancement that would motivate them “to stay and grow”.</p> <p>Walmart now offers employees everything from English language courses to no-cost business degrees. Aditi Chaurasia is one beneficiary. On a video call from her store in Oregon, she tells me how Walmart provided her first job after she moved from India seven years ago and how promotions, training courses and a business certificate turned her from a cashier into a team leader with ambitions to rise further. Walmart could afford a higher starting wage, she argues, but that would not help employees as much. “They're such a big company, they could give $16 an hour [but] even $16 from them is not going to be helpful to these people . . . Maybe it's not paying that much if you're thinking dollars but, if you're [looking at the] big picture, they are promoting their employees, they are giving them free education.”</p> <p>Still, even at $17 an hour, an associate could work 40 hours a week and make only $35,000 a year. In practice, Walmart's median employee made about $25,000 last year, while McMillon made $25mn. “In the richest nation on earth, how did the bar get set so low?” asks Rick Wartzman, author of an upcoming book on Walmart, <em>Still Broke</em>. Wartzman, who runs the Drucker Institute's KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, credits the retailer with undergoing a “remarkable” transformation in how it treats its people. Even so, after all the internal change agents and external agitators, “your average worker's still not making $29,000 a year”. If this is leading the way, he says, then it is a case study in the limitations of voluntary corporate action.</p> <p>Amy Glasmeier, the professor behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living wage calculator, says fast-food chains have displaced Walmart as the “bad actor” on wages, but “Walmart can certainly do better”. Her calculator puts the average sum an American needs to meet “minimum standards of living” at $24.16 per hour. In Benton County, home to Bentonville, it estimates a living wage for a single adult with no children at $15.62. Someone supporting two kids needs $42.21 an hour.</p> <p>Such figures help explain why groups like MSCI and CSRHub, which investors consult to assess how virtuous companies really are, rank Walmart as a leader on environmental issues but a laggard on pay. JUST Capital, which rates businesses' impact on society, puts Walmart in the bottom fifth of US companies when it comes to wages — the issue its surveys show the public cares most about. Martin Whittaker, JUST Capital's CEO, says Walmart ranks “pretty well” for its industry, but the world's largest private employer should do better. “If you think about societal expectations on business to lead, then Walmart must lead.” Citing its least flattering nickname, he adds, “The bully of Bentonville: that can be used as a force for good.”</p> <p><strong>Nobody I meet in Bentonville </strong>calls today's Walmart a bully. Instead, professionals who once planned to change the world through politics, activism or charity have been drawn by the chance to do so with a profit motive attached. Their decisions, echoed in other large multinationals, have raised hopes of progress on some of our biggest environmental, social and economic challenges, though too little to quell accusations of “greenwashing”, “wokewashing”, hypocrisy and virtue signalling.</p> <p>Yet there are still unanswered questions: how comfortable are we with leaving our response to these challenges to companies' self-interest and the resilience of their profit margins? Where does their rising power leave governments, the power centres we once expected to solve such problems? And have we, as participants in the economies large companies now rule, understood our part in shaping their decisions?</p> <p>I make one diversion before leaving town: a mile-long walk from the square to Crystal Bridges, the museum of American art that opened 11 years ago. The Walton family donated the land it sits on and Alice, Sam's 73-year-old daughter, donated much of its collection. She and her two surviving siblings each rank among the world's top 20 billionaires, according to Bloomberg. Together, their wealth is second only to that of Tesla's Elon Musk, outstripping the fortunes Amazon's Jeff Bezos made from ecommerce and LVMH's Bernard Arnault made from luxury retailing. With almost half of Walmart's stock, yielding roughly $3bn in annual dividends, few rival the family's philanthropic clout.</p> <p>The wooded path to Crystal Bridges is criss-crossed by mountain biking trails, funded by Sam's grandchildren to draw more young professionals to north-west Arkansas. As I get closer to the museum, the open-air artworks get larger. A Louise Bourgeois spider. A James Turrell Skyspace. An entire Frank Lloyd Wright house. Admission is free, I discover, thanks to a $20mn donation from Walmart. </p> <p>I make my way to a low-lit room hung with portraits of America's founding fathers and their Native American contemporaries. In the centre is an original copy of the US constitution, a print of the Declaration of Independence and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. Treasures of the American experiment. I peer through their glass cases, hoping to learn where corporations are supposed to fit into the great democratic project, but I see no clues as to what role business should play in promoting “the general welfare”. There is no text setting out what Walmart should do in the world and nobody elected Doug McMillon or the Waltons to do it. Yet, as Charles Fishman wrote in <em>The Wal-Mart Effect</em> in 2006, Walmart derives all of its impact from us, “from our willingness to open our wallets, just a few dollars at a time . . . What could be more democratic?” </p> <p><em>Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT's US business&#xa0;editor</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>A previous version of this story </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3697cf94-7aa5-4662-b042-5c6f112e1c7c\"><em>incorrectly described</em></a><em> Walmart's assessment of global warming targets.
