  "title": "New York Judge Conditionally Lifts Trump Contempt Order in Civil-Fraud Probe; Donald Trump must pay $110,000 fine and submit materials by next week for state attorney general's investigation",
  "text": "<p>If the Republican former president doesn't pay the fine and submit the materials, the contempt finding will be reinstated, Justice Engoron said. The judge paused fines of $10,000 a day as of last Friday, when Mr. Trump's lawyers provided additional information about their search for documents requested by Ms. James, a Democrat.</p><p>Justice Engoron said that the $110,000 fine would be held in escrow while Mr. Trump's appeal of the contempt order is pending. The judge also said that if Mr. Trump failed to satisfy any of the conditions, he would reinstate the fine retroactively.</p><p>Last month, Justice Engoron held Mr. Trump in contempt of court and imposed the daily fine for what he found was the former president's lack of compliance with the subpoena. The attorney general's office issued the subpoenalate last year in its investigation into whether Mr. Trump and his company made false and misleading statements to tax authorities, banks and insurers for financial gain.</p><p>Mr. Trump has denied the allegations and said the probe is politically motivated.</p><p>Last week, lawyers for Mr. Trump filed affidavits detailing their search for documents in file cabinets, storage closets and other locations. In an affidavit dated May 6, Mr. Trump said he had authorized his lawyers to search his private residences, including at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. and in Bedminster, N.J.</p><p>He also included details about his cellphones, which the attorney general's office has requested be searched during the review. Mr. Trump said he didn't know the whereabouts of some prior mobile phones, but that he had submitted a current iPhone to be searched. He uses a second mobile phone only to post on Truth Social, his social-media platform, the affidavit said.</p><p>Lawyers for Ms. James argued in a letter to the judge that Mr. Trump remained in contempt because the third-party firm was still reviewing boxes from off-site storage.</p><p>\"For years, Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization have tried to thwart our lawful investigation, but today's decision makes clear that no one can evade accountability,\" Ms. James said in a statement.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment on the ruling.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p>New York Judge Conditionally Lifts Trump Contempt Order in Civil-Fraud Probe</p>",
