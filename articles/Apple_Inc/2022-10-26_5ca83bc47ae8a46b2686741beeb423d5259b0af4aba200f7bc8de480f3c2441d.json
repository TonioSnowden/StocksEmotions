  "text": "<p>Apple last year began requiring third-party apps to seek users' permission to track their digital footprints, a move that jolted Snap and other companies that used such information to target ads. The digital-ads business also has been hit by global economic uncertainty.</p><p>Snap last week posted a further slowdown in sales growth and signaled the digital-ad market could remain lackluster for some time. The company has lost more than 85% of its market value over the past year.</p><p>At Tech Live, Mr. Spiegel said that despite the business challenges that Apple's changes have created, Snap supported the move because he believes that user privacy is critical.</p><p>\"We have always really cared about privacy,\" he said. \"We were really the first to pioneer ephemeral communications.\"</p><p>Mr. Spiegel expressed confidence in Snap's ability to leverage augmented-reality technology, which imposes digital content over a user's view of the real world. He said he expects it to evolve over time to enable Snapchat users to do more than add dog ears to photos of people or try on clothes virtually.</p><p>\"We're just at the very beginning,\" he said. Augmented reality is \"really going to bring computing to life.\"</p><p>Mr. Spiegel conceded that Snap hasn't had great success with hardware such as its camera-enabled drone. But he said the company is learning from the experiences of subscribers to its Snapchat Plus service, which gives its most-dedicated users access to experimental products.</p><p>\"I wouldn't underestimate the power of fun and giving people new ways to express themselves,\" he said.</p><p>\"As long as we can continue to delight our community,\" he added, \"the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
