  "title": "Apple  Raises  Salary  Budget  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. is boosting pay for workers amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and unionization pushes among hourly store employees. </p><p>   The iPhone maker on Wednesday told employees in an email that the company is increasing its overall compensation budget. Starting pay for hourly workers in the U.S. will rise to $22 an hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% increase from 2018. Starting salaries in the U.S. are also expected to increase. </p><p>   \"Supporting and retaining the best team members in the world enables us todeliver the best, most innovative, products and services for our customers,\" an Apple spokesman said. \"This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasingour overall compensation budget.\" </p><p>   Apple's plans are just the latest by companies fighting to keep talent. Microsoft Corp. told workers this month that the company would almost double its global budget for merit-based salary raises. </p><p>   In recent months, Apple has been facing unusual labor unrest. That discontent has spanned from front-line store retail workers agitating for unionization to salaried engineers unhappy with the company's plans to return to the office. </p><p>   Some workers, including those hourly employees in its stores and AppleCare, were told their annual reviews would be moved up three months and that their pay increases would take effect in early July, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The normal review process coincides with the end of Apple's fiscal year in the fall. </p><p>   Those workers were told the company's increased compensation budget would be in addition to pay increases and special awards already received within the past year. </p><p>   Facing a war for talent, tech companies have also seen their biggest compensation tools, for example, stock, hindered by a downturn in company valuations. Apple shares have fallen 21% this year through Wednesday. </p><p>   That decline has knocked Apple from its perch as the world's most valuable publicly traded company. </p><p>   Apple has seen incredible growth in the past two years. Sales of iPhones, laptops and tablets to workers and students quarantining at home during the pandemic helped fuel record profit for Apple. </p><p></p>",
