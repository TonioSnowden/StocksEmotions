  "text": "<p>Chillies have very wide appeal, according to Joy Michaud of Sea Spring Seeds. “They just seem to be happy, responsive plants. A lot of people get into growing chillies who are not natural gardeners and for some it turns into an obsession.” She affectionately calls them “chilli-heads”.</p> <p>With their white or purple star-shaped flowers that develop into fruit in a myriad of colours, shapes and sizes, they make attractive plants. And, of course, they are useful in the kitchen too. A couple on a windowsill could keep you self-sufficient in piquant fruits.</p> <p>There are five domesticated species of the genus Capsicum, the tropical and subtropical perennials native to the Americas that we call peppers. Capsicum annuum gives us the most culinary varieties, mainly spicy, but including sweet or bell peppers that through a random mutation are heatless.</p> <p>With the linking of the old world and the new by Christopher Columbus, the use of the fruit in cooking proliferated in warmer latitudes around the globe. Growers made selections and crosses to suit regional tastes and the result is the extraordinary variety of chilli peppers.</p> <p>Heat levels vary from the truly benign to the eye-wateringly hot. A chilli fruit's heat is down to a range of chemicals called capsaicinoids that reside in the placental tissue, a sort of pith, that connects the seeds to the fleshy body. The seeds themselves are only hot through their close association with this tissue. Heat can be measured in a laboratory by high pressure liquid chromatography and expressed as Scoville Heat Units (SHU).</p> <p>Michaud explains that testing an individual fruit gives only a snapshot, which needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt. “Looking at one named chilli cultivar, there is always huge variability in heat level between fruits, even those on a single plant,” she says. “We quote a crop average next to each of the varieties we supply, which gives a better indication.”</p> <p>The world's hottest chillies are varieties of Capsicum chinense, the so-called habaneros. Currently in first place in<em> Guinness World Records</em> is C chinense Carolina Reaper with a SHU rating in excess of 1.5m. Other “superhots” include Dorset Naga (up to 1.221m SHU) and Trinidad Moruga Scorpion (about 1.12m SHU). </p> <p>For the spice averse, some habanero types have a lovely flavour and almost no heat. Bellaforma is one, known as a “seasoning pepper” in the Caribbean, and Apricot is another (both about 700 SHU).</p> <p>Chillies need a long growing season, so now is the time to order seed to sow within the next month.</p> <p>Sow seed in pots or small trays of fine-textured compost at a depth of about 5mm. Keep moist and warm (ideally 25C-27C). Light is not necessary for germination but as soon as the seed leaves emerge, seedlings need to be in bright light and still fairly warm (18C and above). This is the trickiest stage to manage and a heated electric windowsill propagator is a big help.</p> <p>When the seedlings have developed two to four true leaves, after the initial two seed leaves, they need gently teasing out of the seed compost. Hold on to the leaves, not the stem, and use a dibber (a pencil or small spoon handle is fine) to transplant the seedlings into small individual pots of multipurpose compost. You can bury them up to the seed leaves if they have got a bit leggy. </p> <p>Water regularly and let them grow on in a warm, light spot. A sunny windowsill above a radiator or in a heated conservatory would be ideal.</p> <p>Your young chilli plants will be ready for transplanting into their final container about eight weeks after sowing, when the roots start to poke through their pots' drainage holes. Choose a pot that measures from 1 to 15 litres to suit the size of the cultivar you are growing. Larger plants also need a stake to help support them. </p> <p>While a full-size glasshouse offers the perfect growing environment, a mini-greenhouse, large cold frame or warm windowsill are almost as good for the smaller varieties.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
