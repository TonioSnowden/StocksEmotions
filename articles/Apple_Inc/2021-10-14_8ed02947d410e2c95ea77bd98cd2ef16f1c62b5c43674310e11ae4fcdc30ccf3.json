  "text": "<p>\"We're committed to birddogging\" Ms. Sinema, vowed Our Revolution Executive Director Joseph Geevarghese to Politico this week. \"We're going to make her life unpleasant or uncomfortable\" until she follows orders. The group—which spun out of Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign—gathered shock troops this week outside Ms. Sinema's Phoenix and Tucson offices to make a start on that threat. Only the left gets away with warnings like this. Suburban parents who grump at school boards are labeled (by the same progressives) \"domestic terrorists.\"</p><p>The Arizona Working Families Party and the Sunrise Movement arrayed Monday at the Boston Marathon with plans to accost the senator as she ran (an injury prevented her from taking part). An activist confronted her on a flight to Washington. Progressives stalked her after she landed, hounding her for responses. This was after activists at Arizona State University chased her into a bathroom and videotaped her there. Liberal groups are running ads in Arizona trashing her. Democratic operatives last month launched the Primary Sinema PAC (using \"primary\" as a verb).</p><p>The press—which spent several years worrying that MAGA hats were triggering—has licensed and encouraged the mob. \"What's Wrong With Kyrsten Sinema?\" demanded the New York Times. The Nation called her the \"Senate's newest super villain,\" while the New Republic branded her a \"traitor.\" Jezebel, the \"feminist\" blog, Tweeted: \"Absolutely Bully Kyrsten Sinema Outside Of Her Bathroom Stall.\"</p><p>You might think party leaders would forcefully condemn the organized harassment of a female colleague. These are the same Democrats who decry environments in which women feel too intimidated to speak about sexual harassment and who brag about their party's number of female members.</p><p>Yet the party's women have been largely silent—never mind the outrage if any group dared similar moves against, say, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (AOC once even objected to Nancy Pelosi's mild, private rebuke of the Squad, saying it amounted to \"singling out\" \"women of color,\" which could inspire \"death threats.\")</p><p>And about the only male Democratic senator willing to say anything about Ms. Sinema was Mr. Sanders—who accused her of \"sabotage.\" Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan sneered that he was waiting for Ms. Sinema to show the party \"something other than a designer purse.\" Remember being told a vote for Mr. Biden was a vote for decency and morality? The oh-so-decent Mr. Biden last week—when given an opportunity to denounce the bathroom bullying of Ms. Sinema—instead called it \"part of the process.\"</p><p>None of this behavior is a surprise to the right. The left more than a decade ago began embracing intimidation as a basic political tool. Think of the Internal Revenue Service targeting conservative nonprofits, or Barack Obama browbeating the Supreme Court, or activist boycotts of companies that supported Republicans. By giving license to this behavior, senior Democrats allowed it to escalate dramatically in the Trump years. Remember Rep. Maxine Waters cheering when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant and telling followers to do the same to others, to \"create a crowd\" and \"tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\"</p><p>It's also no surprise given the cover Democrats and the media gave to appalling behavior over the past 18 months. What's to stop bullying or harassment (much less looting, rioting and arson) when the media and Washington elite will consistently and helpfully write it off as just a bit of \"peaceful protest\"?</p><p>There are small signs Ms. Sinema might be wearying of the treatment and moving more decisively to get on board with reconciliation. Progressives will take that as validation of their ugly campaign. Yet Democrats should be very worried about where this ends, not only for the country, but for their own party.</p><p>If leaders think these kinds of campaigns will stop at the doors of \"centrists\" like Ms. Sinema or Sen. Joe Manchin, they need to crack the history books. An unleashed progressive left will use the same tactics against anyone unwilling to bend to its rule—right, center, left, far left. Revolutions eat their own. And this revolution is now headed toward Democrats themselves.</p><p>Write to kim@wsj.com.</p><p>Democrats Devour Kyrsten Sinema</p>",
