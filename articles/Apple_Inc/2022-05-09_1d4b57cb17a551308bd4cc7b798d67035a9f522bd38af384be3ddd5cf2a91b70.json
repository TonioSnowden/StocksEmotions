  "text": "<p>With the travel industry finally cranking back into action, a podcast about going out and seeing the world would seem nicely timed. <em>Not Lost</em>, from Pushkin Industries, is about travel, though not in the conventional sense. The latest project from Brendan Francis Newnam, writer and former co-host of <em>The Dinner Party Download</em>, it's more an oddball travelogue in which Newnam and his friend, the writer Danielle Henderson, pitch up at various North American locations, wryly reflect on their lives and — this is the odd bit — try to get an invitation to a stranger's house for dinner.</p> <p>In the opening episode they arrive in Montreal in the depths of winter, and immediately kick themselves for not coming in spring. There they meet a gallery curator, a comedian and a food blogger, who tell them about the city's low rents; the “snow sirens” that warn residents to move their cars to make way for the snow ploughs; and a sweet pastry named after flatulent nuns. None of them ask the pair back for dinner (one declines on the basis that it would upset her dog).</p> <p>Later, while Henderson goes for a massage, Newnam goes in search of Leonard Cohen's house, even though he isn't sure where it is, leading him to wander the streets singing “Bird on the Wire” to himself in faux-gravelly tones. On finding the house, he is taken aback by how nondescript it is. “He sang about religion and sex and poets and history, and it's weird just to see a grey house on a little park with a Honda Civic parked out in front of it,” he says. “I'm not really sure why I thought it was so important to come here.”</p> <p>We learn as much about the hosts as we do the places they visit. Newnam reveals how his last job ended “abruptly . . . I was a little bit lost. I went from having this rad show where I spoke with Neil deGrasse Tyson and Scarlett Johansson to my deli guy being the only person I spoke to on a given day.” Meanwhile Henderson talks to her masseuse about the impact her mother leaving the family had on her growing up ­— the masseuse is sympathetic, but nonetheless declines to have her round for dinner.</p> <p>There's an aimlessness to the series that should, in theory, derail it. In fact, it is unexpectedly engaging, aided by clever production where the style is deliberately scrappy, but not so much that it's an affront to the ears (“I'm going to switch mics, so don't say anything interesting,” says Newnam to Henderson at one point, before cutting the sound). <em>Not Lost</em> perfectly recreates that feeling of arriving in a strange place and making peace with being an outsider. Henderson puts it best when she observes how, while travelling, “I don't spend so much time thinking about how I'm going to die alone.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/lb/podcast/not-lost/id1617146007\"><em>apple.com</em></a></p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Not Lost — a thoroughly unconventional podcast about travel' FT.com 9 May.
