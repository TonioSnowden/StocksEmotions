  "text": "<p>(Paramount+)</p><p>\"1883,\" a new drama that premieres Sunday on the Paramount+ streaming service, is the prequel to Paramount Network's immensely popular Kevin Costner series, \"Yellowstone.\" It begins in Texas, as the Dutton family joins a group of German immigrants headed west on a wagon train led by Sam Elliott.</p><p>The series is narrated by the wide-eyed, teenage Dutton daughter, Elsa (Isabel May), who can barely contain her excitement about the new life ahead of her. Her parents, James and Margaret Dutton, are played by married country singers Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Ms. Hill says the pair have been approached numerous times about working on the screen together. It was creator Taylor Sheridan's writing in the early scripts—particularly of the character Elsa and her narration—that convinced her to take on the series, she says.</p><p>\"Her voice alone, her depiction of what is happening in itself is so poetic,\" Ms. Hill says. \"As a mother of three daughters, I'd never read a character with such strength and poetry.\"</p><p>Mr. McGraw, who plays a Civil War veteran who fought with the Confederacy and spent three years in a Union prison camp, says he was also drawn to Mr. Sheridan's writing, as well as the chance to fight bandits in the Old West.</p><p>\"To be on a horse, chasing bad guys, running across rough terrain, riding up ravines, riding down cliffs, shooting bad guys,\" he says, \"I mean, no kid has ever grown up not dreaming about doing that.\"</p><p>New Release: 'MacGruber'</p><p>(Peacock)</p><p>In the first episode of \"MacGruber,\" the president's daughter is snatched away from the family's wine-country estate at Christmastime, and the nation turns to a mulleted, imprisoned hero: MacGruber.</p><p>Will Forte's MacGruber—a spoof on Richard Dean Anderson's \"MacGyver\" of the '80s and '90s—made its debut as a short film on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2007. It went on to become a recurring bit on \"SNL,\" a Super Bowl commercial and a 2010 feature film. On Thursday, \"MacGruber\" premieres as an action-comedy series on Peacock, and also stars Kristen Wiig, Ryan Phillippe, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Elliott. Billy Zane plays the villain: Brigadier Commander Enos Queeth.</p><p>The MacGruber idea has had a long life on multiple platforms, even though it hasn't always landed well. When they were on \"SNL,\" Mr. Forte says writer Jorma Taccone came to him with an idea for an \"SNL\" sketch about a guy who would be \"like MacGyver's less talented brother.\" At first, Mr. Forte shrugged it off, but Mr. Taccone wouldn't let it go.</p><p>\"Eventually, we just wanted to get him to shut up,\" Mr. Forte says of Mr. Taccone, now a co-showrunner on the series. \"So we took a crack at writing it and then we all got excited about it.\"</p><p>Although the movie bombed at the box office, Mr. Forte says he and his collaborators got to make the movie they wanted and remain proud of the result. Fans of the movie, he says, can expect more of the same in the series.</p><p>\"It's certainly an acquired taste,\" he says. \"It's not for everyone, but hopefully, more people give it a shot.\"</p><p>New Release: 'With Love'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>\"With Love,\" a new series that premieres Friday on Prime Video, is a romantic comedy featuring three generations of the Diaz family of Portland, Ore. Each of the five episodes takes place on a different holiday, starting with Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.</p><p>The ensemble series hinges on family members' love lives: the 20-something kids who share an apartment with single friends, middle-age parents whose marriage is showing signs of wear and grandparents who talk openly about trying to get into the shower together.</p><p>The series was created by Gloria Calderón Kellett, who was inspired to make a series this time last year. She was facing Christmas separated from her family. She was also saddened by the negativity and hate crimes toward people of color and those in the LGBTQ communities coming through her social-media feeds. Ms. Kellett says she wanted to create something \"that's warm and joyful and reminds us of family and of what good we can have on the other side of this.\"</p><p>Though the story is centered around a Latino family, Ms. Kellett worries that calling the show a Latino-romance comedy—as she has often seen it—will make some people think the show isn't intended for everyone.</p><p>\"I worry that the qualifiers marginalize it, that the qualifiers say: 'Oh, well, this is for these people,' \" she says. \"I hope to invite everybody to my house for Christmas. And this is what it looks like.\"</p><p>Streaming Notes</p><p>—Pandemic tales: \"Station Eleven,\" a new series based on Emily St. John Mandel's 2014 novel, tells the story of the survivors of a pandemic. It premieres Thursday on HBO Max. Meanwhile in \"Creamerie,\" a comedy now streaming on Hulu, all the world's men are thought to have been killed in a global pandemic. And, don't forget: Will Forte also starred in this year's \"Sweet Tooth\" (Netflix), in which he raises his son in the wilderness during another global pandemic.</p><p>—The end: Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali and perennial Oscar nominee Glenn Close star in \"Swan Song,\" a new film about a man with a terminal illness that begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>What to Watch: Seven Movies and Series to Stream This Week</p>",
