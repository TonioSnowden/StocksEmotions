  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Invasion,\" a new 10-part sci-fi drama that premieres Friday on Apple TV+, is the story of an alien invasion that focuses a microscope on the lives of different characters around the world reacting to an existential crisis. If that sounds similar to H.G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds,\" well, that's no accident.</p><p>Writer, executive producer and co-creator Simon Kinberg says that he originally sold the project to Apple as an adaptation of the book, which was famously brought to radio by Orson Welles. Mr. Kinberg says he wanted to bring \"the level of reality that he brought to that radio play\" to the screen. But as he started building out the story and the characters, he realized what he had in mind wasn't \"The War of The Worlds,\" but a new story with a similar premise.</p><p>Mr. Kinberg has worked with some of the biggest pieces of intellectual property in Hollywood, from \"X-Men\" to \"Star Wars.\" But he felt that to call his series \"The War of the Worlds\" would be promising something that it wasn't. Plus, he believes audiences are in the mood for something new.</p><p>\"I've made movies based on comic books and bestselling books, and it's a wonderful sort of guarantee, to some extent, as much as anything can ever be guaranteed,\" he says. \"But I do think that we are reaching maybe a saturation point where people want original material.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Queens'</p><p>(ABC, Hulu)</p><p>There are parts of 1999, the year she released her hit debut album \"Let There Be Eve ... Ruff Ryders' First Lady,\" that Eve doesn't remember.</p><p>\"I smoked a lot of weed back then,\" she said with a laugh in an interview.</p><p>These days, the rapper turned actress and former co-host of \"The Talk\" says rather than spend, say, Sunday mornings hung over, she spends them in bed with her husband and dog trying to figure out who's going to make breakfast.</p><p>In ABC's new one-hour drama, \"Queens,\" she plays a rapper whose life has taken a similarly domesticated turn. Eve's Brianna is a former member of a '90s hip-hop group, Nasty Bitches, who has become a wife and mother. She and her band mates reassemble after a young rapper samples one of their hits and brings the group back into the zeitgeist. The series joins Peacock's \"Girls5Eva\" as at least the second series released in 2021 about a '90s group that reassembles after a young rapper samples one of their old hits.</p><p>Alongside Eve, the cast includes Brandy, another '90s hit maker; Naturi Naughton, formerly of the R&amp;B group 3LW; and Nadine Velazquez.</p><p>Eve says that when she was considering the role, she had to remind herself that she would be portraying a character, not herself, despite the similarities. But sometimes on set, she says she couldn't shake the parallels between her life and the life of Brianna.</p><p>\"Some days when it does happen,\" she says, \"it is pretty spooky.\"</p><p>New Release: 'The Boys'</p><p>(Amazon, Apple Books)</p><p>\"The Boys\" tells the story of Rance and Jean Howard, an aspiring actor and his wife, who leave the shrinking live-TV world of New York for Hollywood in 1958, hoping to land roles in westerns and detective shows. In California, the pair find themselves supporting their sons as their screen careers take off. The book is written—and the audiobook is read by—the boys themselves: Ron Howard, who became both Opie on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and the director of films like \"Cocoon\" and \"A Beautiful Mind,\" and Clint Howard, a character actor who has appeared in films like \"Austin Powers\" and \"The Waterboy.\"</p><p>The story of the Howard family parallels the history of TV and film in ways that few family histories can. Ron Howard said he wanted to let readers in on his view of some of the ways the industry has changed, while also marveling at how much has stayed the same.</p><p>\"The angst around the creative decision-making, problem-solving process, the goal of trying to connect an idea ... with an audience, these things have not really shifted,\" he said in a recent interview alongside his brother, adding: \"You're trying to tell a story in a compelling way that speaks to an audience in that moment, and then hopefully resonates beyond the day, week, month, or year the project is first seen.\"</p><p>Clint Howard said the big-picture approach is one way he and his brother differ.</p><p>\"Ron, you always have been kind of a big-picture guy,\" he said in the interview, \"and I just sort of said, No: I think the reader of 'The Boys' wants to know about Clint, and I'm gonna give 'em Clint.\"</p><p>Streaming Notes</p><p>• More Dune: Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune\" hits theaters and HBO Max on Friday.
