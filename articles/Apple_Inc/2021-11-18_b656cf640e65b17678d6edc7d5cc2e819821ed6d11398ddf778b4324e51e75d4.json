  "title": "'The Line' Review: What Happened in Mosul; A four-part documentary looks at former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>\"The Line\" is a corrective of sorts—often thrilling, close to thorough and remarkably evenhanded: The interviewees in this captivating four-part documentary include Mr. Gallagher himself, who appears throughout the series and is as solid a witness as his defense team might have dreamed of. Some of the human pieces of the puzzle, such as it is, are MIA. But the nuances of the case, which sometimes got lost in the headlines, receive the attention they deserve.</p><p>Mr. Gallagher, a decorated Navy veteran, was on his eighth deployment at the time the alleged crimes occurred in 2017, when members of his own SEAL Team 7 say he murdered civilians, as well as an ISIS prisoner of war, someone so young and small he wore a \"wristwatch around his biceps.\" (It is so described, but we also see it on the helmet-cam video.) What we don't see is the knife assault by Mr. Gallagher on the wounded terrorist, something that isn't really in dispute although the motivations are. Nor do we get any account from Jake Portier, Mr. Gallagher's superior at the time and the officer who heard his men's early complaints about Mr. Gallagher in the field. There's also nothing from the Team 7 medic, Corey Scott. His absence from the film—as anyone familiar with the details of the case will be aware—is as damning to his credibility, and that of Mr. Gallagher, as anything we do see or hear.</p><p>Strategy isn't just for military operations: It's essential to plot development, and \"The Line\" rolls out like a courtroom thriller—whether there's such a thing as a \"spoiler\" in a news-based documentary may be questionable, but the impulse here is not to reveal what unfolds incrementally in the show.</p><p>There are a number of shocking revelations, shocking because they're made at all. Episode 1 of \"The Line,\" which was developed out of the eponymous podcast, establishes the brotherhood, camaraderie and interdependence of the players. This is especially true during the battle for Mosul, which Team 7 members recall being a brilliant success, one in which they took risks, sidestepped orders and inspired the anti-ISIS Iraqi forces. The tone doesn't exactly conform to what follows, which is Mr. Gallagher's fellow SEALs—a few with faces and voices disguised, but most not—recounting Mr. Gallagher's performance during that time, which they claim included the indiscriminate shooting of women, schoolgirls and old men and bragging about it later.</p><p>It's a perceptual roller-coaster ride that directors Doug Shultz and Jeff Zimbalist take us on, careening from the Gallagher family's \"Free Eddie\" campaign and its reliance on pure emotion (how dare the Navy accuse such a \"warrior\" of war crimes?) to the stance of Mr. Gallagher's team members, who did, and do, have logic on their side. Why would they put everything on the line personally, and besmirch the entirety of their beloved SEALs, to make such appalling accusations? Because Mr. Gallagher was a sneak thief who stole food out of their backpacks? (Mr. Gallagher denies the thievery; he doesn't quite deny everything.) Or was it because they thought he was out of control? That's their position. What the audience's will be at the end of \"The Line\" may not be a lot different than it was at the start. But that won't be the fault of the show.</p><p>'The Line' Review: What Happened in Mosul</p>",
