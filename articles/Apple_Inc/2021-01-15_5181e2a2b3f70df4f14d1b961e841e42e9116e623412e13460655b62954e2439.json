  "text": "<p>After a near decade of cultural hegemony, social media now finds itself unstuck. The exile of Donald Trump from Twitter last week may have seen the platform finally acknowledging responsibility for its users' content, but for many the prevarication over the rights and wrongs of online censorship has been lamentably slow. There's a widespread disillusionment about social media influence, a general acceptance that it's feeding a malaise. </p> <p>The “digital detox” has become a well-worn phrase in recent years as people have attempted to prise their eyeballs away from the more addictive platforms. Now there seems an appetite for quitting it for good. Earlier this month, Bottega Veneta, the Kering-owned fashion house and darling of the style cognoscenti, kissed goodbye to 2.5m Instagram followers without warning and deleted its entire social media footprint in one stroke. And in Los Angeles, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched Archewell, their not-for-profit compassion initiative, amid speculation they have dumped their social media feeds. </p> <p>For Meghan and Harry, who have more than 10m Instagram followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/\">@sussexroyal</a> but have not posted anything since last March, the virtual world has become intolerable. Meghan claimed that in 2019 she was “the most trolled person in the entire world, male or female”, and that the couple has suffered an “almost unsurvivable” volley of abuse. </p> <p>Certainly, in the inflammatory world of current politics, the tenor of engagement has reached a screech. Even relatively benign platforms such as Instagram have become hazardous with conflict. Sensitive topics, compressed into memes and slogans, have become fresh ammunition and everything from <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/american-dirt-jeanine-cummins-book-controversy.html\">fiction</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jan/12/anna-wintour-kamala-harris-vogue-cover\">Vogue covers</a> has been co-opted to fight the culture war. Cancel culture may be part of an ongoing social evolution, but it can be a brutal battleground. And from being the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of modern communication, our feeds have become the manifestation of a toxic status quo. </p> <p>Worse. When it's not being mean and spiteful it makes us miserable instead. Numerous studies — and popular documentaries such as <em>The Social Dilemma</em> — have established that social media can precipitate depression, engenders feelings of low self-esteem and encourages sleep disorders. Scientists and behavioural psychologists have long entreated us to quit. One study of Facebook users found that those who stopped engaging felt a distinct deceleration in their feelings of anger, depression, loneliness and anxiety after quitting Facebook. And that was after just one week. Which belies the argument that social media can serve as a proxy family and better connect us, especially during this pandemic, when real-life encounters have been so hard. </p> <p>But while there's every evidence to suggest that getting off social media would make me happier, more productive and a great deal less anxious, am I quitting? Absolutely not. For all their evils, Instagram and Twitter have still been my comfort blanket throughout this ghastly period. They've also been an essential tool for working, a constant source of inspiration, an amazing network system and a means for getting news. Besides, without social media, I might not have caught The Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, exhorting the sanctity of American democracy while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1348249481284874240\">wielding his Conan the Barbarian sword</a>. Nor would I have been able to share excerpts of Fran Lebowitz expostulating in the Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MClMxqD-HNA\"><em>Pretend It's a City</em></a> with other Lebophiles on Instagram. Or swap amazing sea shanties on TikTok with the financial opinion editor of the Financial Times. </p> <p>It will take more than a few hateful messages before I attempt my dopamine fast. However, there is something in the Bottega decision that gives me pause for thought. I admire their drift away from virtual messaging, and the recognition that creativity should not be expressed in squares. In a press pack to accompany its latest show, the designer sent out a vinyl record and an assortment of material in order to communicate a 21st-century interpretation of the Victorian-era salon vibe. Smaller, quieter, with a focus on the physical.</p> <p>Bottega is one of a clutch of brands and influencers who have tapped the general craving for a more intimate exchange. Such analogue objects as a pen and paper, books and records have taken on a luxurious new lustre in this sterile pandemic world. While our working lives are still lassoed to video conferencing and laptops, it has become a peculiar indulgence, for instance, to pick up the telephone. Closer, more personable — and, perhaps cynically, far easier to retract.</p> <p>Then again, Bottega doesn't need social media. It has a wealth of highly engaged fan sites doing a far more effective job of promoting — and selling — the brand's wares. Maybe that's the answer. In order to protect ourselves from vitriol, we should simply outsource our social media selves to someone else. Or maybe, to further still our anger, we could swap identities in a kind of epic “share the mic” experience with our social media foes. Rather than walk a mile in our enemy's shoes, we could instead share shoe-fies, try to understand their viewpoints and learn TikTok dances with their friends. It would be excruciating, but it might stop everyone from shouting. And it would sure make us less mean.</p> <p><em>Email Jo at </em><a href=\"mailto:jo.ellison@ft.com\"><em>jo.ellison@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
