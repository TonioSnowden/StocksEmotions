  "text": "<p>As an Apple executive, Mr. Levoff had a duty to not trade on its material nonpublic information. But he made both bullish and bearish trades over five years, generating profits of $277,000 and avoiding losses of $377,000 on other transactions, according to prosecutors.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Levoff declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Levoff pleaded guilty to six counts of securities fraud and will be sentenced in November, the New Jersey U.S. attorney's office said. He faces up to 20 years in prison for each count of securities fraud.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Mr. Levoff in February 2019 in civil court. The SEC's lawsuit, which was suspended to allow the criminal case to proceed, asked a court to bar Mr. Levoff from working as an officer or director of a public company.</p><p>Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>Former Apple Lawyer Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading</p>",
