  "title": "Stock Pickers Trailed Market Again in Roller Coaster 2020; Some 60% of U.S. large-cap stock-picking funds lagged behind S&P 500 in 2020, marking 11th straight year of underperformance",
  "text": "<p>Last year's market tumult was unprecedented: As Covid-19 spread, the benchmark U.S. index lost a third of its value in less than five weeks in February and March, before leaping higher to set new highs in August and ending the year with double-digit gains.</p><p>But the failure of most stock-picking funds to beat benchmark indexes was nothing new : 2020 was the 11th consecutive year in which a majority of actively managed U.S. large-cap funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices ' year-end scorecard on active management.</p><p>One factor that might have contributed to the difficulty of beating the market last year was the resounding performance of big tech stocks , which exert a powerful force on the S&amp;P 500. The broad U.S. stock index's 16% gain for the year was propelled by an 81% surge in shares of Apple Inc . and a 76% climb in shares of Amazon.com Inc .</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you weigh the choice between actively managed funds and index-tracking funds? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"The dominance of really large stocks creates difficulties for active managers,\" said Craig Lazzara , global head of index investment strategy for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices . \"You would have to have a bigger position than most active managers are comfortable with if you were going to maintain overweights in the biggest stocks,\" he said.</p><p>At the end of December, Apple accounted for 6.7% of the S&amp;P 500, while Amazon made up 4.4%.</p><p>This year has been a different story so far, with tech stocks lagging behind the market  as investors snap up shares of energy and financial companies in a bet on broader economic growth. While the S&amp;P 500 is up 4.9% in 2021, Apple and Amazon shares are down.</p><p>Among the three biggest actively managed U.S. large-cap funds at the end of last year, 2020 performance was mixed, according to data from Morningstar Direct.</p><p>Class A shares of American Funds The Growth Fund of America —a $256 billion fund at the end of December—posted a return of 38% in 2020, outperforming the 18% total return of the S&amp;P 500 and the 33% total return of the S&amp;P 500 Growth index.</p><p>The oldest share class of Fidelity Contrafund Fund, which was also categorized as a growth fund by Morningstar , had a return slightly under 33%, beating the S&amp;P 500 but trailing the growth index. Class A shares of American Funds Washington Mutual Investors Fund, by contrast, posted an annual return of 7.7%, lagging behind the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Active managers did somewhat better in choosing midcap and small-cap stocks, with 51% and 46% of funds in those categories underperforming their respective S&amp;P benchmarks.</p><p>Stock picking could have more opportunity for success in areas like small-caps, where companies often receive less scrutiny than their larger peers, said Sarah Samuels, director of investment manager research at NEPC, an investment consulting firm.</p><p>\"Smaller-cap names are less well-covered by analysts,\" she said. \"It's not as efficient, and therefore you should be able to add more value.\"</p><p>Stock-picking strategies geared toward fast-growing companies or low-price value shares also were relative bright spots last year. More than half of large-cap growth funds and large-cap value funds—62% and 67%, respectively—outperformed their benchmarks.</p><p>Over the long run, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices found that most U.S. equity funds, regardless of category, fail to beat the relevant stock index. Of the U.S. large-cap funds that were in business 20 years ago, 6% are both still operating and have beaten the S&amp;P 500 over that time, according to the report.</p><p>At the end of 2019, $4.6 trillion was indexed to the S&amp;P 500 in passively managed funds, while $6.6 trillion was benchmarked to the index in actively managed funds.</p><p>Write to Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com </p><p>Stock Pickers Trailed Market Again in Roller Coaster 2020</p>",
