Buffett later confirmed Abel as his ordained successor to CNBC on Monday.</p> <p>Abel has long been regarded as a top contender for Buffett's throne, alongside his other top lieutenant <strong>Ajit Jain</strong>. DD readers will remember that Abel was the man <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/940dedb2-61e5-4039-8551-2246dd8f3105\">sitting by Buffett's side last year</a> in Munger's absence, which for many signalled his place as successor-in-waiting.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The Canadian runs the group's sprawling portfolio of non-insurance investments, which include the<strong> Burlington Northern Railroad</strong> he once oversaw as chief and <strong>Dairy Queen</strong> ice cream. He also sits on the board of <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong>, of which Berkshire is a big shareholder.</p> <p>Filling Buffett's shoes will be a mammoth task. But here is what Abel stands to inherit — a sprawling conglomerate with an ever-growing cash pile that has ballooned to $145.4bn. Believe it or not, one of the main challenges will be finding ways to spend that money.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The other will be pleasing Berkshire shareholders. While the company's profits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33bbf579-20c2-40e4-aec6-4ce76161e18f\">surged</a> in the first quarter as its investment portfolio swelled in size, there have been rumblings of discontent among Buffett's loyal followers — over Abel and Jain's pay packages as well as Berkshire's efforts on climate change.</p> <p>A shareholder proposal on climate change disclosures, which the company had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/490949ae-964e-4291-b58f-d5d4126cf371\">urged investors</a> to reject, garnered about 25 per cent of the votes cast. Shareholders including <strong>BlackRock</strong> and <strong>Norges Bank</strong> voted in favour of the proposal. Other activist investors could smell an opportunity to attack.</p> <p>Buffett once admitted to the possibility himself, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a096fe-6ef6-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5\">stating</a> in 2019 that “there are no perpetuities” and Berkshire “needs to deserve to be continued in its present form”.</p> <h2>It's better to be a Spac sponsor than a Spac investor</h2> <p>The question as to why there are so many Spacs has a relatively simple answer: they're a moneymaking machine if you're on the right side of the table.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sponsors are in for a huge windfall if a deal gets done. That's because their 20 per cent stake in the shell company, which they receive effectively for free, converts into a smaller slice of equity once a business is acquired.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bankers and lawyers, meanwhile, are in line to receive two sets of fees — one for the listing and the other for the merger.</p> <p>But what about the investors? DD's Ortenca Aliaj and James Fontanella-Khan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8\">looked through data</a> provided by Refinitiv to track how companies that had gone public through Spacs since 2020, with a valuation of above $1bn, were trading from their peaks.</p> <p>Here's what we found: of the 41 Spacs that have completed transactions since the start of 2020, only three are even within 5 per cent of their share price peaks. Eighteen of them have more than halved, and several are down by more than 80 per cent. The average decline is 39 per cent.</p> <p>It's a sign that retail investors and other market players are cooling in particular on start-ups with lofty projections but little to show in the way of revenue or often even a product.&#xa0;</p> <p>Take electric vehicle start-up <strong>XL Fleet </strong>as an example. Shares in the company shot up almost 70 per cent to a peak of $35 after it went public via a Spac in December. Its stock price is now down to just under $7, a fall of 80 per cent. Even investors who bought into the Spac at the $10 initial public offering price are facing substantial paper losses.&#xa0;</p> <p>It comes back to a criticism that is often levelled at Spacs, and Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger touched on over the weekend: sponsors have an<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b481c63-f9b4-4226-a639-238f9fae4dfc\"> outsize incentive</a> to strike deals even if they're not necessarily with the best companies.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Apollo hedges its bets on Yahoo sports</h2> <p>Will the umpteenth attempt to turn round <strong>Yahoo</strong> finally work?&#xa0;</p> <p>A betting man would think twice. But <strong>David Sambur</strong>, the co-head of private equity at <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, is confident.</p> <p>“Some things deserve to be overlooked, but some have more than meets the eye,” <strong>Sambur</strong> told DD's JFK. “We're not buying the most obvious . . . That's on purpose.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Apollo <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef0992ec-1d4f-4030-95a9-d950e47338e1\">has agreed</a> to pay $5bn to own 90 per cent of <strong>Verizon</strong>'s media assets, which include what was left of<strong> AOL</strong> and Yahoo. The group believes it can leverage the huge user base that flocks to their sites to offer them new lucrative services.&#xa0;</p> <p>How exactly?&#xa0;</p> <p>Take Yahoo Sports, which monetises the millions of fans that use it to get news and play in fantasy leagues through old-school ad banners at the top of the website.</p> <p>Apollo believes it can become a new destination for online sports betting, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb04b14c-e215-4ae8-a655-2bf85fcb73c0\">loosening regulations</a> in the US spell dollar signs for private equity.&#xa0;</p> <p>More recently Apollo has acquired the operations of<strong> Las Vegas Sands</strong>'<strong> Venetian </strong>resort <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23a62fa7-ad0b-42a3-a2e6-7dde7774282d\">for $2.25bn</a>, <strong>Great Canadian Gaming</strong> for $2.5bn, and Italian sports-betting group <strong>Gamenet</strong>.</p> <p>It's a strategy that has played out well for Apollo's rivals in the sector, especially since 2018 when the US struck down a federal ban on sports betting.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Apollo has plans to transform Yahoo Finance, used by many retail investors to get their daily stock market tips and investment ideas, into an online stock broker that could rival the likes of <strong>Robinhood</strong> and <strong>Charles Schwab</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's certainly a long shot and could end disastrously, like Apollo's acquisition of <strong>Caesars</strong> in 2008 that later went bankrupt. Then again, it could be, as <strong>Sambur</strong> put it, like “finding a diamond in the rough”.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>TikTok</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7cf94c1-eaae-46d2-8e27-99fa71adb5c2?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">named</a> <strong>Shouzi Chew</strong>, the chief financial officer of its parent company <strong>ByteDance</strong>, as its new chief executive, replacing <strong>Kevin Mayer</strong>, who quit last year shortly after joining from Disney.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Sixth Street </strong>has named former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> chief financial officer and chief information officer <strong>Martin Chavez</strong> as a partner and its new vice-chair.

(<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apollo-apo-billionaire-founders-brawl-shunting-aside-josh-harris?sref=OziMsGoK\">Bloomberg</a>)</p> <p><strong>Undercover M&amp;A </strong>For a Big Tech behemoth, Apple's dealmaking strategy is decidedly less overt. Its quiet shopping spree, picking up small companies across artificial intelligence and semiconductors, among other fields, could shed some light on its next move.

But there were other forces at work underpinning his dramatic exit — the ethnic politics rattling tech and a growing rift between Silicon Valley and “conventional” corporate culture.
