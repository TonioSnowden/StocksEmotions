  "text": "<p>In October, traders were encouraged when some Fed officials said they are considering whether to slow the pace of monetary tightening as they balance controlling inflation and avoiding a sharp economic contraction. The European Central Bank also cited concerns that additional rate increases could hurt the outlook for growth.</p><p>October's stock rally came despite falling government-bond prices and rising yields, which for much of the year had slammed stocks. Monday's gain sealed the 10-year Treasury yield's climb to 4.074% from 3.802% at the end of September. Yields and bond prices move inversely.</p><p>That pattern suggests some investors were thinking wishfully when bidding up stock prices in October, said Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research. \"I think it was largely a hope trade,\" he said. \"I don't think it was built upon fundamentals.\"</p><p>This week, traders are shuffling their holdings ahead of Wednesday, when Fed officials are almost certain to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point. On Monday, the S&amp;P declined 29.08 points, or 0.7%, to 3871.98 and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite shed 114.31, or 1%, to 10988.15. The Dow dropped 128.85, or 0.4%, to 32732.95.</p><p>The focus will be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference, which could bring clues about whether the Fed may reduce the size of future rate increases or continue strong efforts to tame rising prices.</p><p>Specifically, investors want to know if December will mean another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase or whether the Fed will downshift to a half-percentage-point move. Bets in futures markets show that traders see roughly even odds of either outcome, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"I'm anticipating hearing Powell walking a fine line, trying to point out some of the positive data without the market taking it as a full-blown pivot,\" Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said.</p><p>Tech stocks helped drag down stock indexes. Meta Platforms, lost $6.04, or 6.1%, to $93.16, continuing last week's slide that followed a disappointing earnings report. Apple fell $2.40, or 1.5%, to $153.34 as Foxconn, an important contributor to Apple's iPhone production, struggled with a Covid-19 outbreak at a factory in China.</p><p>Whatever the size of December's move, economists caution that high inflation -- still at an 8.2% annual rate in September -- will keep the Fed on track to bring rates up well into next year. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their estimate of how high the Fed's target interest rate will eventually climb. The bank now expects the Fed's target to reach 4.75% to 5% next year, up from the Fed's current range of 3% to 3.25%.</p><p>Chicago wheat futures rose 6.4% to $8.82 a bushel after Russia said it would suspend participation in the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 94 cents, or 1%, to $94.83 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%, contributing to a 6.3% rise in October.</p><p>Chinese markets rallied early Tuesday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up almost 4% and the Shanghai Composite up 1.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.4%.</p>",
