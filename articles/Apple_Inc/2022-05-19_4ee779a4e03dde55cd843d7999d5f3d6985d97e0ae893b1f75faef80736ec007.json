  "text": "<p>Plots appear twice on Apple TV Plus: first as farce then as a tragedy-laden thriller. Four months ago the streaming service launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8625bfca-5828-4a89-b829-77dd96129693\"><em>The Afterparty</em></a>: an ensemble murder-mystery parody that centred on a group who find themselves implicated when a former classmate is killed after a school reunion. Arriving on the platform this week is a new bilingual eight-part series, which could share that same one-line synopsis if the word “parody” was removed and “school” replaced with “university”.</p> <p>But while coincidences may exist in Apple's production slate, they have no place in <em>Now and Then</em>. Here, one death is inextricably tied to another that took place 20 years earlier and involving the same circle of friends. </p> <p>We begin Then. An opening scene takes us back to 2000 and a beach in Key Largo, Miami. Six Spanish-speaking Hispanic graduates are celebrating the end of their studies. One of them, Dani, records the whole evening on a camcorder, a detail that does more than just locate us in an analogue era.</p> <p>She asks everyone where they see themselves in the future. A couple, Marcos and Sofia, are set on becoming a war-zone doctor and human rights lawyer respectively, while Ana dreams of the White House. Alejandro simply hopes they'll be friends till the end, which, for him, is only a few hours away. </p> <p>After he suddenly loses consciousness the gang drunkenly try to take him to hospital. A fatal car crash ensues and a cover-up is swiftly put together. Despite the efforts of tenacious rookie cop, Flora (Rosie Perez), the truth about what happened that night remains closely guarded by the five friends. </p> <p>For two decades, at least. In the present, an anonymous text arrives on the eve of an alumni event telling the long-estranged group that they must attend or face their secret being leaked. They comply, but there's little time for nostalgic reminiscences as another message soon arrives demanding $1mn from each of them. One will pay with their life, and Flora is back on the scene.</p> <p>Although the premise might bring to mind a host of stories besides <em>The Afterparty</em>, the show at least boasts a strong cast — including Marina de Tavira (Oscar-nominated for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2529acd6-f30a-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f\"><em>Roma</em></a>) and <em>Y tu mamá también</em>'s Maribel Verdú — and commendably tries to marry the intrigue with observations about how youthful idealism yields to a life defined by compromise and disappointment. It may not be groundbreaking, but this polished, racy thriller does manage to hit the spot, every now and then.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from May 20</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Now and Then review — polished, racy thriller on Apple TV Plus' FT.com 19 May.
