  "text": "<p>Last week, I participated in a solemn ritual that almost half a million other New Yorkers had already experienced. I travelled to the cavernous Javits convention centre in Manhattan, identity documents in hand, where US soldiers waved me into a line. With hundreds of others, I followed colour-coded paths through the cathedral-like auditorium to tables staffed by nurses (and more soldiers), who jabbed my arm with a BioNTech/Pfizer&#xa0; vaccine, then gave me a sticker, a bottle of water and a ­vaccination card.</p> <p>Just 45 minutes later, the soldiers ushered me out on to the pavement with my freshly vaccinated cohort. Some were hugging each other for joy, others were taking selfies and most were tapping their phones as they ordered a ride home.</p> <p>“How do you feel?” a friend asked me by text as I told her that I had emerged from this rite of passage. My answer was unexpectedly mixed. First, I was overcome by a level of euphoria I had not anticipated: after months of corrosive, concealed anxiety, I wanted to scream with joy. </p> <p>However, I was also hit by a sense of guilt. New York state is distributing free vaccines to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility-expands-16-ny-76892855\">anyone over the age of 16</a> who has the tenacity (and digital skills) to book an appointment on the glitchy public website. More than five million shots have been dispensed so far in various centres.</p> <p>My daughter was there with me at the Javits Center, getting her own jab. Yet she, like me, betrayed mixed emotions. “Why can I get it when others who need it can't?” she asked. She knows that in many other US regions the shot is barely provided even to the vulnerable.</p> <p>But a third — and equally unexpected — emotion also hit us: a newfound appreciation for the idea of a shared civic identity. During the past year, Covid-19 has not just ­cruelly exposed social divides; it has trapped us in our households and social tribes. Yet with the vaccine, we are all equal when the needle pricks our skin: we need the same dose, administered in the same way. </p> <p>While the Javits line included privileged New Yorkers like me, it was also a cross section of ages, ethnicities and disabilities, such as the deaf couple nearby who used an iPad to communicate with the soldiers. It was a humbling and inspiring exercise in our shared humanity; let us hope we can retain that memory in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>It would be nice to remember something else, too: that government bureaucracy can sometimes be a force for good. This idea has been wildly unfashionable in the US since Ronald Reagan's presidency, but particularly so in the Trump era, when agitators such as Steve Bannon tried to smash what he called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/donald-trump-dismantling-american-administrative-state\">the “administrative state”</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the mass vaccinations will mark the moment when the state begins to be seen not just as a problem, but as a solution too. If so, the timing is fortuitous given the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9793903a-e29f-42dc-9b8d-55f960b0ede5\">Biden administration's massive infrastructure plans</a>. And what is striking about these ambitions is not just the vast sums of dollars involved, but that they put the government back into a central role in science, technology and much else. </p> <p>In January, for example, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/a-letter-to-dr-eric-s-lander-the-presidents-science-advisor-and-nominee-as-director-of-the-office-of-science-and-technology-policy/\">Biden wrote a letter to his new White House scientific adviser</a> that cited the spirit that drove the government-led initiatives unleashed by the 1930s presidency of Franklin D Roosevelt. This suggests — as the economist and financier Bill Janeway observes in an astute new essay on the <a href=\"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/guest-post-bill-janeway-on-lessons\">Noahopinion blog</a> — that Biden is aiming for nothing less than a second “New Deal”.</p> <p>Of course, this may never fly — and some observers are uneasy about aspects of the Biden programme: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/opinion/biden-spending-clean-energy.html\">Steve Rattner</a>, a member of the Obama team, warned this week that there should be limits to excessive reliance on government involvement. But no one can deny that the zeitgeist is shifting.</p>  <p><strong>There was a final emotion</strong> that hit me on the steps outside the centre: a newfound optimism in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-26/roaring-twenties-2020s-will-try-to-roar-like-1920s-after-covid\">the “Roaring Twenties” thesis</a> that economists keep using to describe a putative economic rebound. I initially felt quite sceptical of this idea. But as my post-jab elation took hold, I suddenly got an inkling of what animal spirits might be about to emerge. </p> <p>That is not because I think vaccinations alone will liberate us: shuttered offices, masks and distancing will be here for months as the virus mutates. Nor do I expect New York to bounce back to its former vibrancy any time soon — it faces a crippling fiscal hole because so <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3aa94524-45d5-4475-aa40-8b70b5b2f812\">many wealthy taxpayers have fled</a> and the pandemic has exacerbated inequalities.</p> <p>Yet since more than 10,000 New Yorkers are currently visiting the Javits Center every day, with thousands more vaccinated at smaller sites, it should come as no surprise that many of the restaurants that survived the pandemic are now heavily booked, that friends with disposable income are planning vacations, that (smallish) dinner parties are taking place again and that everyone is discussing looming cultural events. Nor that when I hailed an Uber to take me home after my shot, I saw that the fare had doubled. “Yikes!” I thought, recoiling. I hadn't seen such surge pricing for a year.</p> <p>But then I happily paid up: Uber drivers need all the help they can get after the past 12 months. And in 2021, even surge pricing seems like a springtime sign of hope.</p> <p><em>Follow Gillian on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilliantett\"><em>@gilliantett</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email her at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=gillian.tett@ft.com\"><em>gillian.tett@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first. </em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caf55fbb-8b64-4e87-8251-5be08b453fb4\"><em>Lockdown habits mask vaccine euphoria</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caf55fbb-8b64-4e87-8251-5be08b453fb4\"><em>From Mark Travers, Doylestown, PA, US</em></a></p><p>Source: Gillian Tett 2021 'Covid vaccines show government can be a force for good' FT.com 14 April.
