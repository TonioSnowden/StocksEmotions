  "title": "Apple Event: New iPhone Lineup to Be Revealed Tuesday; No dramatic changes are expected to the smartphone after a year of record sales amid App Store dramas",
  "text": "<p>It caps a year in which Apple has seen record profit, in large part because of last fall's iPhone 12, while also weathering battles with opponents unhappy at the power it holds over third-party software on its mobile devices.</p><p>It will also mark Mr. Cook's first public appearance since a federal judge Friday ruled largely against \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games Inc.'s attempt to undo Apple's grip through an antitrust lawsuit that sought to allow third-party developers to bypass the App Store.</p><p>Instead, the judge cited the value of Apple's ecosystem to consumers, while finding that its rules prohibiting developers from steering users to alternative payment methods outside of their apps was against California law and ordered it stopped. Epic is appealing, and Apple has said it is reviewing the verdict.</p><p>Before the ruling, Apple had been making concessions on the so-called anti-steering provision as it worked to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by smaller developers and an investigation by Japanese authorities.</p><p>It would be unlike Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive, to comment during Tuesday's event on news swirling around the company. Instead, he and his executives will likely talk about the features of the new iPhone and other new offerings.</p><p>The new iPhone is not expected to offer dramatic changes compared with last year's highly anticipated debut of phones, which can use ultrafast 5G cellular connections. The company is expected to keep the small, medium and large sizes, while offering improvements to cameras and batteries, a person familiar with the matter said. Apple is also expected to reveal its newest smartwatch.</p><p>The company is on pace to finish its fiscal year this month having sold a record number of iPhones. Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average predict Apple shipped 239 million devices, beating the previous record of 231 million in fiscal 2015 when the first large-screen version fueled growth.</p><p>Apple no longer discloses unit sales but has said device revenue rose 38% in the first three quarters of the year compared with the previous year. Analysts predict iPhone sales will finish the year up 41% at a record $194 billion.</p><p>It is unlikely that Apple can maintain that growth next year, analysts say. In July, it raised concerns about the industry's microprocessor shortage hindering iPhones. Sales also typically fall in the year following the first 12 months of major introductions, such as the iPhone 12. For example, after posting its previous best year for iPhone revenue in fiscal 2018, thanks to the debut of the iPhone X with a facial-recognition unlock and new look, device sales fell in the following two years.</p><p>\"On many levels, the iPhone 12 cycle looks similar to the iPhone 6 cycle and iPhone 10 cycles,\" Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said this summer in a research note. He pointed out that Apple's stock did poorly after each cycle, falling 32% and 39% from peak to trough following the iPhone 6 and iPhone X, respectively.</p><p>When asked about the potential drop-off in iPhone sales, Mr. Cook told analysts in July: \"We're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double-digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing nine months or so into this.\"</p><p>Apple shares tend to reflect the excitement about the iPhone. In the months ahead of the latest phone's launch in 2020, the stock doubled. So far in 2021, shares have risen nearly 13%.</p><p>Investors' focus on the iPhone is a reason why Apple has been highlighting the company's services business and its smartwatch. Apple on Tuesday is expected to unveil a watch with a different appearance than the round curves. Apple's wearable unit is expected to grow to $38.7 billion this fiscal year compared with $10 billion in 2015 when the Watch made its debut, analysts said.</p><p>Apple's legal challenges</p><p>More WSJ coverage, selected by the editors</p><p>* Judge Orders Apple to Loosen App Store Restrictions in Mixed Verdict (Sept. 10)</p><p>* App Developers' Payments Dilemma: Easier With or Without Apple and Google?
