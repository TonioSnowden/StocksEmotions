  "title": "Tesla is the most profitable short pick of 2022, with nearly $14 billion in proceeds since Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter; Tesla shares drop below $125 for first time in more than two years as market cap slips below $400 billion, making car maker worth less than Visa",
  "text": "<p>The decline has pushed Tesla's market capitalization lower than $400 billion, dropping it to no. 10 on the list of most valuable companies in the S&amp;P 500 index. SPX Visa Inc. V moved higher than Tesla on Tuesday, when Tesla's intraday trading levels put its valuation around $392 billion cap while Visa's was $418 billion. Walmart Inc. WMT , at $383 billion, was sneaking up on Tesla with a chance to knock it out of the top 10.</p><p>Read: Tesla's stock drop has been bad. But this company has wiped out more investor wealth in 2022</p><p>Short sellers, whom Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has made a point of targeting previously, are having a happy holiday if they bet against Tesla this year, S3 Partners' Managing Director of Predictive Analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky said in a note. He pointed out that Tesla has been the most profitable stock to short in 2022.</p><p>\"Short sellers have been backing up their TSLA short exposure for good reason, it is the most profitable short, in dollar value, of 2022,\" Dusaniwsky said. Tesla shorts are up $15 billion in year-to-date in mark-to-market profits in 2022, with a gain of $4.54 billion in December alone, according to S3 data.</p><p>\"Since Elon Musk's Twitter bid on 4/14/22, TSLA shorts are up $13.74 billion in mark-to-market profits,\" Dusaniwsky said.</p><p>The analyst said short interest in Tesla has been declining since April because of the price drop, but short selling has increased since August, with 3.05% of the stock's float short, making it the second largest short behind Apple Inc. AAPL and its $16.78 billion in short interest.</p><p>Read from Monday: Tesla analysts say they can't ignore Elon Musk's Twitter 'nightmare' anymore</p><p>Tesla shares were under pressure Thursday after the company doubled the discount it offers to customers who \"take delivery of a new Model 3 or Model Y between December 21 and 31, 2022 for a $7,500 credit and 10,000 miles of free Supercharging,\" according to its website, raising concern that demand in the EVs is slipping. Tesla buyers are no longer eligible for a U.S. tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasers of electric vehicles, but that incentive could return in 2023, which could be a disincentive to purchase a Tesla in the U.S. this year.</p><p>Tesla shares are off 64.2% for the year, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 18.6% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMPis down 33.7%.</p><p>Tesla is the most profitable short pick of 2022, with nearly $14 billion in proceeds since Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter</p>",
