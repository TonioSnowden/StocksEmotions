  "text": "<p>Will Justin Trudeau's political gamble backfire?</p> <p>Canada's Liberal party leader announced a snap general election last month, hoping to win an outright majority — or at the least expand his minority.</p> <p>Instead, Trudeau has run up against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adcafe07-2dfe-455d-a260-716677fac448\">a well-managed campaign</a> by Erin O'Toole, the opposition Conservative party leader, who has broken with predecessor Andrew Scheer by moving to the centre on social issues and climate change, and eschewing fiscal conservatism in favour of new stimulus spending.</p> <p>The parties ended the campaign neck and neck as voters questioned whether Trudeau <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d876013-0e3d-407e-9ef9-8fe0c32e827e\">needed to call an election</a> with two years of the ruling party's term still to run and in the middle of the country's fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic. O'Toole was also helped by a resurgent separatist party in the battleground province of Quebec.</p> <p>Ken Boessenkool, a top campaign strategist for former prime minister Stephen Harper, said throughout the campaign the Liberals had been unable to articulate the reason for calling an election. He told the FT:</p> <blockquote>  <p>‘It's astounding to me that the person who decided the date of the election woke up that day and couldn't answer the question of why he did that. And I think that is the explanation for why Erin O'Toole is popular more than anything Erin O'Toole has done'</p> </blockquote> <p>Voting begins today but the result may be delayed, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vote-counting-elections-canada-2021-1.6179742\">according to the Canada Broadcasting Company</a>, because of up to 1m postal ballots that will not be counted until tomorrow.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas, here's the rest of today's news — Gordon.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

Also, columnist Enuma Okoro explores the meaning of home and Tim Harford helps us let go of our to-do lists.</em></p> <p><strong>What themes and stories are you most looking forward to discussing on the FT Weekend podcast? </strong>I can't wait to introduce people to the cast of eclectic geniuses that make up FT Weekend. They're experts in the fun stuff: wine, film, interior design, behavioural economics. Next week, our travel writer Maria Shollenbarger is taking us on the actual Orient Express. It's pure fantasy.</p> <p><strong>What else are you listening to right now? </strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/really-good-shares/id1576208098\">Really Good Shares</a> is a journey about recovery. It's not a traditional interview show. It's great. There's also a special series about to launch on Wednesday from the FT's very own <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/behind-the-money/id1376303362\">Behind The Money</a>, about ESG investing. I've heard a sneak peek and it's excellent. </p> <p><strong>What's the best book you've read in the past year? </strong><em>The Island of Missing Trees</em> by Elif Shafak. I know this may be cheating because she's our guest on this week's podcast. But she makes space for nuanced conversations between cultures with sensitive histories; conversations we almost never have. In this novel, it's between the Greek and Turkish people of Cyprus. It's about family history, inherited pain and fig trees. I loved it.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Canada goes to the polls' FT.com 20 September.
