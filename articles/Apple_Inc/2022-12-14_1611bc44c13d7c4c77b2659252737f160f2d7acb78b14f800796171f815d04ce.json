  "text": "<p>Trial Is Postponed</p><p>A Hong Kong court postponed the national security trial of jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai until September, citing scheduling conflicts and an uncertain wait for a ruling from Beijing on whether he can be represented by a foreign lawyer.</p><p>Mr. Lai, 75 years old, is the founder of the now-closed Apple Daily, a staunchly pro-democracy newspaper that aggressively criticized China's ruling Communist Party and Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leadership.</p><p>Beijing has accused him of helping to orchestrate widespread antigovernment protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and local authorities have pursued an aggressive legal campaign against him. He has been charged with colluding with foreign countries and the international community to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, which is banned under the national security law that Beijing imposed on the city in 2020. He faces up to life in prison for the security law charges.</p><p>Mr. Lai also faces sedition charges for articles published by Apple Daily in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>\"Beijing seems intent on imprisoning one of its most powerful critics for many years, possibly for the rest of his life,\" Maya Wang, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.</p><p>More than 200 people have been arrested under the security law since it came into effect in June 2020 and more than half of those have been prosecuted.</p><p>-- Austin Ramzy</p><p>---</p><p>DENMARK</p><p>Leader Agrees to</p><p>Bipartisan Alliance</p><p>Denmark's Social Democratic leader Mette Frederiksen said on Tuesday she had agreed to form a bipartisan coalition with her continuing as prime minister, the first alliance in decades to bridge the country's traditional left-right political divide.</p><p>Making up the new government with Ms. Frederiksen, who in the previous term headed a one-party government, are two center-right parties: The Liberal Party, the other traditional political heavyweight in Danish politics, and the newly formed Moderates. Tuesday's pact ended weeks of government negotiations.</p><p>During her campaign Ms. Frederiksen argued that a broad government was needed at a time of international and domestic uncertainty, caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, skyrocketing energy prices and the highest inflation in four decades, which hit 11.4% in October. The election in early November took place a little more than a month after explosions assumed to be sabotage damaged the Nord Stream pipelines off Denmark's coast.</p><p>Industry groups have supported a broad coalition, which they think will help push through economic reforms. Centrist and left-wing parties gradually withdrew from coalition negotiations.</p><p>-- Sune Engel Rasmussen</p><p>---</p><p>SOUTH KOREA</p><p>BTS Member Jin</p><p>Begins Military Duty</p><p>BTS member Jin has joined the army. The singer began his mandatory military service in South Korea on Tuesday, marking a new chapter for a band that has become an economic juggernaut in the country.</p><p>Jin, who turned 30 this month, is the first of BTS's seven members to enlist in the South Korean army. Most men between the ages of 18 and 28 are required to serve in the military for at least 18 months. Some entertainers, such as Jin, are allowed to delay enlistment until they are 30 years old.</p><p>Jin reported to an army training center on Tuesday in Yeoncheon County near the North Korean border, according to local media reports.</p><p>BTS, short for the Korean name Bangtan Sonyeondan, is one of the most popular music acts in the world. Formed in 2013, the group capitalized on the K-pop genre's growing popularity and built a global fan base with songs about self-acceptance and empowerment.</p><p>-- Alyssa Lukpat</p><p>---</p><p>GHANA</p><p>Government, IMF</p><p>Reach Bailout Deal</p><p>Ghana will start negotiations for debt relief with its foreign bondholders and government creditors this week, the West African country's finance minister said Tuesday, setting up another default by a developing nation amid rising global interest rates and the fallout from the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Last week, Ghana asked owners of about $11 billion in domestic bonds to exchange them for new ones with longer payment deadlines and lower interest rates. The debt relief is required for the country to secure a $3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, which was agreed in principle on Tuesday.</p><p>The IMF rescue deal will also require Ghana to raise taxes and cut spending, further hurting its citizens, who are already struggling with annual inflation that topped 40% in October.</p><p>-- Gabriele Steinhauser</p>",
