  "text": "<p>The Federal Reserve should press ahead with a plan to dial down its massive pandemic stimulus programme despite an abrupt slowdown in US jobs growth last month, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c2fc0ce-e7c0-4083-92e8-e81d9235ab45\">according to a top central bank official</a>.</p> <p>James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, dismissed concerns the labour market recovery was faltering, even after just 235,000 jobs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b66803b-59a4-4596-be91-ccb241043864\">were created in August</a>, and reiterated his call for the central bank to begin scaling back or “tapering” its massive $120bn-a-month bond-buying programme soon.</p> <p>Bullard, who is one of the longest-serving members of the Federal Open Market Committee, acknowledged that Delta-related concerns were having an impact, but stressed that other supply-side issues — including enhanced unemployment benefits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2c18184-5cb9-4947-bde4-a80f3b9b1880\">that expired for more than 7.5m Americans this week</a> — were also holding people back from returning to the workforce. He told the FT:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“The jobs are there, it's that the workers may not want to take those jobs right now.”</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Do you agree with Bullard?
