  "text": "<p>Having read “Health challenge: Medical practice lags behind scientific discovery and wearables technology” (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03bffd0f-e011-48ad-8660-62881882884c\">Report</a>, January 5) the unanswered question is why Apple doesn't go the whole hog and sell toy stethoscopes and headdresses with embroidered little red crosses. </p> <p>I am sure Leonardo da Vinci felt that his drawings of flying machines were “lagging behind their potential”. There is a reason why 99.9 per cent of doctors are “not on board”- 100 per cent of wearables produce reams of useless information. A pretty good measure of how one sleeps is how one feels the next day; no amount of pulse measurements or buckets of confetti for “steps” will detect hypertension. </p> <p>It is not very encouraging that Apple is “invigorated by stories of customers whose lives have been improved”. Another word for “stories” is “anecdote” which has always been the enemy of science. </p> <p>I presume that this article was published with good reason on the page facing details of the Elizabeth Holmes trial: both wearables and Theranos are on the same Silicon Valley naive dream-spectrum. </p> <p>But doctors have had a tough couple of years. If you have an Apple Watch, please do share your data with us, we need a good laugh.</p> <p><strong>John Meenan</strong> <br><em>London SW6, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Apple wearables promise one reader a good laugh' FT.com 10 January.
