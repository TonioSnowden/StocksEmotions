  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Driverless-Car Startup  Lays Off 150 Workers  ----  By Nora Eckert",
  "text": "<p>   Argo AI, a Ford Motor Co.-backed startup focused on driverless-car technology, laid off about 150 workers this past week, a belt-tightening measure following years of fast-paced hiring. </p><p>   The layoffs represented about 6% of the company's more than 2,000-person workforce, a company spokesperson said. </p><p>   \"With incredible growth and progress made in our mission to deploy driverless vehicles, we are making prudent adjustments to our business plan to best continue on a path for success,\" Argo said in a statement. </p><p>   The spokesman added that the Pittsburgh-based startup is taking this step to correct an aggressive period of hiring and get its staffing levels back in line to hit operational goals. </p><p>   Launched in 2016, Argo garnered attention as one of a handful of driverless-car firms looking to advance the autonomous-driving technology with the aim of deploying vehicles that can fully operate themselves using software and computers -- and without a human driver. Over the years, it has received investments from some of the world's largest car companies. </p><p>   Ford holds an ownership stake in Argo, having initially invested $1 billion in Argo in 2017. Volkswagen AG invested $2.6 billion in the tech startup. </p><p>   Walmart Inc. joined with Argo and Ford last year to test an autonomous-vehicle delivery service in three U.S. cities. The firm began driverless-car operations in Miami and Austin on the Lyft Inc. network earlier this year, and aims to install 1,000 autonomous vehicles on that network in the next few years. </p><p>   As Argo has built up its business, it has lured talent from established tech companies, such as Apple Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. </p><p>   Still, the prospects of commercializing fully driverless technology remain uncertain with many executives saying the technical and regulatory hurdles are steeper than they initially envisioned. </p><p></p>",
