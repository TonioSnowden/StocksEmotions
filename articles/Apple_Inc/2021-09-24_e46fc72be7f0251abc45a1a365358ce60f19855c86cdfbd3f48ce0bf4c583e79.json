  "title": "Supply-Chain Crunch, Chip Shortage Focus of White House Meeting; Biden administration urges companies to volunteer information about their supply chains",
  "text": "<p>Companies that participated in the White House talked included Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Intel Corp., Medtronic, Samsung Electronics Co., Stellantis NV and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</p><p>\"Today's discussion was an important opportunity to continue efforts to improve the automotive semiconductor supply chain and set the foundation for mid- and long-term capacity solutions,\" said John Bozzella, president and Chief Executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents car companies and auto suppliers.</p><p>The administration is also ratcheting up what it calls an early-alert system to mitigate semiconductor plant shutdowns related to the spread of Covid-19's Delta variant. U.S. diplomats to countries in Southeast Asia including Malaysia and Vietnam will be asked to work with governments to keep factories running while ensuring Covid-19-related worker protections are in place, officials said.</p><p>The chip crisis has squeezed a range of industries, from auto manufacturing to consumer electronics and medical equipment, causing prices to rise for consumers. Short-term solutions have been elusive.</p><p>Supply hasn't kept up with pandemic-induced changes in work and entertainment habits and demand for devices such as tablets. U.S. auto makers, which cut chip orders at the onset of the pandemic only to see rising demand from other industries, have been forced to slow or cease assembly lines. The price of new and used cars has risen.</p><p>Supply-chain disruptions have been a focus of the Biden administration, which has convened other meetings with affected sectors such as home construction and health.</p><p>The issue of transparency came up during an April meeting that Mr. Biden held with auto and tech executives. Auto makers sought insight from chip makers on how many semiconductors will be available and on setting production schedules. Chip manufacturers sought a clearer picture of actual demand, hoping to avoid so-called ghost orders, which can be canceled.</p><p>The White House is pressing Congress to provide funding for bipartisan legislation known as the Chips for America Act, designed to encourage domestic semiconductor investment. While the Senate approved $52 billion in June, the House hasn't taken action on the measure.</p><p>The U.S. has lost ground on semiconductors to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing fell to 12% in 2020 from 37% in 1990. China and others have provided subsidies to global competitors, making it harder to attract new plant construction in the U.S.</p><p>Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com</p><p>Supply-Chain Crunch, Chip Shortage Focus of White House Meeting</p>",
