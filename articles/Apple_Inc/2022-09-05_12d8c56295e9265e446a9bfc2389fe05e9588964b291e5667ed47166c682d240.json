  "text": "<p>RF Kuang follows up her <em>Poppy War</em> trilogy, a fantasy reimagining of the opium wars, with a hefty standalone novel that again addresses 19th-century imperialism. In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PIgvxB\"><strong>Babel</strong></a> (HarperVoyager, £16.99, 560 pages), Cantonese orphan Robin is taken from his homeland to Oxford, where he joins the academics at the Royal Institute of Translation. </p> <p>This building, a lofty bastion of study and learning, also serves as a repository of magical power derived from the disparity in meaning between words in different languages — “the stuff that gets lost when we move between one language and another”, as one character puts it — which is harvested and stored in bars of silver.</p> <p>Allegory alert: Britain relies on this culturally exploitative resource to maintain its grip on its dominions. So, naturally, when Robin falls in with a group of marginalised misfits and comes to understand how he is helping prop up colonialism, he turns revolutionary — and empires have never looked kindly on insurrections. </p> <p>Kuang tells Robin's story with the impassioned sweep of a Dickensian tale, and if her tone veers towards the donnish at times (explanatory footnotes abound) this feels appropriate in a book that is unabashedly a love letter to scholarship.</p> <p>Christopher Priest's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AFzqEU\"><strong>Expect Me Tomorrow</strong></a> (Gollancz, £22, 336 pages) is also set partly in the 1800s. One of its parallel storylines features Norwegian-born twins, climatologist Adler Beck and his brother Adolf. The latter was the focus of a criminal trial in the UK, one of the Victorian era's great miscarriages of justice. The other storyline takes place in 2050 and revolves around a fictional set of twins, Charles and Greg Ramsey, descendants of the Becks. The plot device that unites these two narrative strands is a chip implanted in Charles's head, a kind of ultra WiFi that enables him to travel back in time and inhabit the minds of his forebears.</p> <p>Twins are a recurring theme in Priest's work, central to novels such as <em>The Prestige</em> (1995) and <em>The Separation</em> (2002), but here the greater emphasis is on the climate crisis. The strongest sections of the novel show vividly the inexorable unfurling of global eco-cataclysm, which the author depicts with a weary, detached fatalism. The joins between the two storylines are far from seamless and, other than lamenting humankind's irresponsible ways, it's not really clear what this book is about.</p> <p>Much further into the future, we find a ravaged, post-apocalyptic world where storms rage, monsters roam and fragments of the old prelapsarian technology survive. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Abn1am\"><strong>Leech</strong></a> (Tor, £16.99, 336 pages), a splendidly bizarre and unrelentingly dark debut from Hiron Ennes, is narrated by a doctor who is in fact a centuries-old symbiotic parasite, using humans as vessels through which to practise medicine. In a remote snowbound château, the character confronts another parasite that appears anything but benign.</p> <p>Ennes revels in the squirmy, squelchy disgustingness of flesh and viscera, combining imagery reminiscent of the shape-shifting alien of John Carpenter's 1982 film <em>The Thing</em> with the detached, analytical tone of a David Cronenberg body horror film. There is something uniquely compelling, too, in the novel's quasi-Victorian prose and use of an attenuated French dialect throughout, courtliness being one of the few things to endure after the collapse of civilisation.</p> <p>If, in our Anthropocene era, rampant capitalism is responsible for the doomed state of the planet, should we shed a tear when a hard-nosed, polluting plutocrat is brutally killed? The victim in Guy Morpuss's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dRIhu7\"><strong>Black Lake Manor</strong></a> (Viper, £14.99, 400 pages) is a tech billionaire and a Steve Jobs fan, who is discovered in his office with his chest torn open and heart cut out.</p> <p>A perfectly serviceable premise for a gory murder mystery, but this novel has other ideas. As with his debut offering last year, the excellent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78106e25-92b2-4284-9ef4-757eada8651c\"><em>Five Minds</em></a>, Morpuss overlays sci-fi concepts on the conventions of vintage crime fiction. The setting is a storm-lashed clifftop mansion in Canada, there are plenty of suspects, and the scene of the murder is a locked room. But the year is 2045, and Shan has succeeded in creating autonomous hard light replicas of human beings, which he has dubbed “ghost dancers”, but which might as well be called red herrings. In a further tweak to the formula, Morpuss introduces characters who can rewind time by six hours, a hereditary gift shared by members of a First Nation tribe, although it can only be used once per lifetime.</p> <p>All of the foregoing greatly complicates the investigation being conducted by protagonist Ella Manning, former naval officer and now Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable. The fact that she used to be Shan's fiancée doesn't help, either.</p> <p>Alongside its main narrative, the book interweaves two backstories, and you could be forgiven for thinking that Morpuss has bitten off more than he can chew. But he marshals everything with a firm hand and, although the journey is long and sometimes tortuous, it arrives at a satisfying destination.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: James Lovegrove 2022 'Genre round-up — the best new science fiction' FT.com 5 September.
