  "text": "<p>   By the end of 2019, the sniping had taken a toll. Moderna's shares were 15% below its own IPO price from a year earlier, making it harder for Mr. Bancel to raise new money. Moderna was forced to slash spending. Some investors were upset the company had shifted its focus to vaccines. The criticisms didn't seem fair to Moderna's researchers. They were injecting mRNA molecules packed with genetic instructions, producing ample proteins in the body that could teach the immune system to protect against disease. Moderna was even working with Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other senior U.S. government scientists who were becoming intrigued by Moderna's mRNA techniques. </p><p>   Moderna hadn't tested its vaccines in many people, though. Like Dr. Sahin and BioNTech, Mr. Bancel's company wasn't close to an approved vaccine. Moderna was planning its very first Phase 2 clinical study for a vaccine and was nowhere near a late-stage trial for any of its products. The company hoped to have a vaccine in the market by 2023 but even that goal seemed ambitious. Effective vaccines took an average of 10 years to develop; measles, the fastest in history, took four years. There was little reason to expect success from Moderna anytime soon. </p><p>   In December 2019, Mr. Bancel flew to Europe with his wife and daughters to spend the holiday season at a home he owned in southern France. It was a chance to escape the pressures of running his company and dealing with the doubters. </p><p>   One morning, just after the New Year, Mr. Bancel woke up early and headed to his kitchen, trying not to wake his sleeping daughters. Mr. Bancel brewed some Earl Grey tea and grabbed an aging iPad on the kitchen table. He checked his emails and scrolled through the latest news. One story stopped him cold: Lung disease was spreading in southern China. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel began emailing Barney Graham, a senior U.S. government scientist. </p><p>   \"Do you know what it is?\" Mr. Bancel asked. </p><p>   Dr. Graham, a veteran vaccine researcher at the National Institutes of Health, said he and his team were aware of the outbreak. Rumors on Twitter and China's Weibo social-media platform pointed to a cluster of pneumonia cases around the city of Wuhan, in southern China. Dr. Graham had already emailed a younger scientist in his lab, Kizzmekia Corbett, saying they needed to prepare for whatever was emerging in that country. Details were scant, though -- Dr. Graham didn't even know if a virus or bacteria was causing the infections. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel couldn't stop thinking about the spreading illness. His scientists had no experience with bacterial infections. But if a new virus was in fact emerging, maybe his team members could do something about it. Perhaps they could finally prove that mRNA worked. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel kept sending messages to Dr. Graham, each one more urgent than the last. </p><p>   \"What's the latest?\" </p><p>   \"Do you know yet?\" </p><p>   \"Is it a virus?\" </p><p>   Dr. Graham promised to let Mr. Bancel know as soon as he learned the cause of the sickness. A few days later, as he and his family flew back to Boston, the outbreak remained on his mind. He doubted the sickness in China was going to be a huge deal. </p><p>   But what if it was? </p><p>   By mid-January 2020, Dr. Sahin was convinced the coronavirus emerging in Wuhan would spread, leading to a pandemic. He convened an early-morning meeting of BioNTech's senior executives. </p><p>   \"We're going to need a vaccine,\" he said. \"I think we can do something about it with our mRNA.\" </p><p>   Days later, though, as Dr. Sahin walked the office, he heard employees chatter about the ongoing Mainz Carnival, a season of merrymaking. It drove Dr. Sahin nuts. He told employees to cancel their holiday plans and stop taking public transportation, to avoid infection. You need to focus on a vaccine, he told them. </p><p>   \"I'm serious about this,\" he told the researchers, saying that millions of people would die from the new virus. Now, they got the message. </p><p>   Dr. Sahin called Philip Dormitzer, a senior Pfizer Inc. scientist. He warned Dr. Sahin against spending too much time on a vaccine, reminding him that two coronaviruses had emerged in the previous decade before petering out. </p><p>   \"Remember, SARS was contained,\" Dr. Dormitzer said. \"MERS, too.\" </p><p>   Dr. Sahin ignored the warning, pushing ahead. But he needed help. BioNTech only had about $300 million on its balance sheet. He called another senior Pfizer executive, Kathrin Jansen, who proved more worried about the virus. The two companies agreed to collaborate on a vaccine. </p><p>   Dr. Sahin had hope. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel told his team a vaccine was their priority. But Stephen Hoge, Moderna's president, was wary. The company has just 800 employees, limited cash, and it had never run a late-stage trial. If Moderna built a Covid-19 vaccine and it failed, the company was likely doomed -- investors would never forgive it for dropping everything to build a vaccine. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel was insistent. He had committed Moderna to work with Dr. Graham's team at the NIH to quickly develop a vaccine, and later Moderna would get even more help from the government's Operation Warp Speed. In February, the company shipped its first batch of Covid-19 vaccines, to the NIH to begin testing in mice. Early results showed the shots elicited antibodies to the coronavirus, a promising, albeit early, sign. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel convened a meeting with top Moderna executives in a ninth-floor conference room. Usually, he oozed confidence. This time, he was serious and measured, worrying the group. </p><p>   \"We've been asked to make a vaccine,\" he said. \"We have to try.\" </p><p>   Staffers listened somberly. They realized the seriousness of the moment, some for the first time. They thought of their own health, the imminent threat to their families, and the immense challenge ahead. </p><p>   During the summer of 2020, Dr. Sahin was upbeat. He worked on the vaccine's trials, helped solve manufacturing issues and led negotiations on deals to distribute shots in various countries. </p><p>   In late summer, though, as Dr. Sahin awaited the critical results of the vaccine's Phase 3 clinical trial, he became more anxious. An effective vaccine could help bring an end to the pandemic and give his company the opportunity to produce other drugs and vaccines. Failure would mean a lengthier pandemic and more global misery. </p><p>   Thomas Strungmann, a German businessman and longtime backer of Dr. Sahin's work, saw that he needed a distraction. During weekly Sunday night calls, Mr. Strungmann began chatting with Dr. Sahin about books, movies, and other lighter topics -- anything but BioNTech's shots -- brightening his mood. </p><p>   Mr. Bancel and senior executives at Moderna needed a way to calm their own nerves ahead of their vaccine's late-stage results. They decided to loosen things up and share a drink during daily Zoom deliberations; some sipped glasses of wine, while others drank beer. After a few weeks, though, the group realized they were inviting trouble with their nightly drinking sessions. They returned to alcohol-free meetings. </p><p>   For a healthier diversion, Mr. Bancel joined regular Zoom calls with close friends. He looked exhausted, sometimes joining the calls after getting three hours of sleep. Mr. Bancel didn't want sessions to end, though, clinging to fleeting moments of calm as tensions built. </p><p>   On Sunday, Nov. 8, just after Americans voted in a contested presidential election, Dr. Sahin and Dr. Tureci were told the results of the vaccine's Phase 3 trial. It was an interim analysis after a significant number of 44,000 subjects had become infected with SARS-CoV- 2. </p><p>   Around 10 p.m. in Germany, Dr. Sahin and Dr. Tureci arranged a call with five members of their senior executive team. One executive, Sean Marett, dialed in to the video call in his basement, to avoid waking his sleeping children. He sat on the edge of a couch, near some children's toys. His palms were sweating as he waited for the news. </p><p>   \"We got the results,\" Dr. Sahin said. </p><p>   Nearly every person who had come down with Covid-19 had been in the placebo group. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 95% effective. Complete silence. The staffers were stunned. Then, Mr. Marett began laughing. Within moments, the entire group was giggling uncontrollably. In an instant, months of fear, pressure and nervousness had been released. </p><p>   A week later, the data-safety monitoring committee overseeing the Moderna vaccine's trial was ready to share interim results of the company's own Phase 3 study. Dr. Hoge, representing Moderna, dialed in to the video call. He was terrified. Pfizer-BioNTech's numbers had been so good. What if Moderna's didn't come close? Around noon, committee members sent word to Dr. Hoge and Dr. Fauci that they were ready to share the results. </p><p>   Dr. Hoge studied the faces on the screen and said he thought: Gimme a smile! Someone, anyone! </p><p>   The committee's chairman addressed the group, recounting all the reasons the trial had been conducted and what it aimed to find. Dr. Hoge tried to mask his impatience. He thought: The goal?! Dude, we're trying to stop a pandemic; that's the goal! </p><p>   Mr. Bancel and others sent messages to Dr. Hoge on a group chat. </p><p>   What's going on?! </p><p>   Then the numbers were revealed: The Moderna vaccine had proved 94.5% effective at protecting people from Covid-19. Dr. Hoge couldn't believe what he was hearing. He zoned out. Then, he panicked that he had missed some important information. </p><p>   He stole a moment to text his colleagues. </p><p>   It's a home run. </p><p>   A HOME RUN. </p><p>   In his home in Boston, Mr. Bancel met his wife in a hallway. They embraced. His 18-year-old daughter raced down from her second-floor room, while his 16-year-old daughter ran up the basement stairs. They all began crying. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Adapted from \"A Shot to Save the World: The Inside Story of the Life-or-Death Race for a COVID-19 Vaccine,\" by Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman, to be published by Portfolio on Oct. 26. </p><p></p>",
