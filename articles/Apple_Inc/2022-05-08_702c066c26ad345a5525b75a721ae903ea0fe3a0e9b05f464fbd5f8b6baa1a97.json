  "text": "<p>Retail investors who have kept the faith in tech stocks have been amply rewarded by buying the dip over the years, but their patience and optimism were being tested again on Friday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5766cdb7-7399-4552-9884-d3fd3339fb0d\">opened 2 per cent lower.</a></p> <p>Wall Street had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ba254c-74e3-4e33-903d-98813264ed4c\">closed sharply lower on Thursday</a> in an abrupt reversal from the rally in the previous trading session, with the Nasdaq registering its biggest one-day decline since June 2020 and the largest U-turn since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>The Nasdaq Composite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52c8227d-f87e-421a-be43-395c37f17eab\">fell 5 per cent</a>. The rally on Wednesday and the retreat on Thursday marked the sharpest gyration in the index since March 2020, with the Nasdaq oscillating more than 8 percentage points over two days of trading.</p> <p>The move took its decline for the year to 21 per cent with worries about rising rates hurting high-growth tech stocks, which first reared their heads with a tech sell-off last November, persisting.</p> <p>April had already been the cruellest month as<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/093738c4-574a-43cc-bd71-aee1b0700caa\"> those macro concerns</a> were combined with softer business updates from tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix. The Nasdaq's April fall was 13.3 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa46a15f-9144-4e7c-a86f-7c75c87611aa\">the worst monthly decline</a> since October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers had rocked financial markets.</p> <p>While analysts argue <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d87d045-60a9-46ec-af0d-10740f253fe0\">the fundamentals still look good,</a> tech fans will keep coming back for more and volatility will continue. Today is another case in point — the Nasdaq had recovered all of its losses by 1pm New York time, but is now back down 2 per cent.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Russia under intensive hacker attack</strong><br>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3391bf8c-e431-415c-b7c5-9eeee08b3374\">widespread assault </a>is taking place in cyber space, with Russian companies and government bodies swarmed by hordes of pro-Ukrainian hackers, many of them new and previously unknown players to cyber security experts.</p> <p><strong>2. Arm China chief's last stand</strong><br>Gaining control over its renegade Chinese unit is crucial to plans being drawn up by the chip designer's owner, Japan's SoftBank, to list the UK's biggest technology company. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48baeb67-2d3c-41c3-8645-e89ac69a985a\">Anna Gross, and Ryan McMorrow in Beijing,</a> provide the blow-by-blow on Allen Wu's last stand.</p> <p><strong>3. Fake meat start-ups go to court <br></strong>Executives in the food industry are closely watching a patent dispute between Impossible Foods, one of the earliest plant-based meat producers, and Motif FoodWorks. The dispute <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43912436-e579-4756-9795-b78fb4457c7a\">centres on a protein molecule</a> designed to make plant products taste like beef burgers.</p> <p><strong>4. US Congress urged to regulate stablecoins</strong> <br>Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate banking committee, has sounded the alarm over the fast-growing stablecoin industry, warning that “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e88d46c8-a897-4cfc-8a68-e5370e6242d0\">bad things will happen</a>” unless the $180bn market in popular cryptocurrencies is regulated soon.</p> <p><strong>5. Nasa tackles asteroid strikes</strong> <br>The existential threat from asteroids and comets, portrayed in films such as <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Don't Look Up</em>, has been known since scientists showed in the 1980s that an impact 65mn years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. Now, Nasa is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0512837d-259c-4836-b3d0-842dad122a21\">smash a spacecraft</a> into a faraway asteroid at 23,000kph to divert its path.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Tala's Muse Portable Lamp</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/091bab2d-0c0b-4262-ad73-6c99bc7da2ff\">FT Weekend has been looking at </a>the most wildlife-friendly ways to illuminate your garden. LEDs can actually be more harmful for insects than traditional sodium bulbs if they emit white and blue light. A warm white is both better on the human eye and far less disruptive to wildlife.</p> <p>Another way to ensure you're only lighting your garden when necessary would be to invest in a portable lamp — such as <a href=\"https://www.tala.co.uk/product/the-muse-portable-lamp-in-pleasure-garden-green/\">Tala's new Muse lanterns, </a>which have a 24-hour battery life and USB charging point. An added benefit of going portable is that you can dine in various parts of your garden without the need for permanent lighting. A very warm, dim light (Tala's LED lanterns are dimmable) allows you to enjoy the subtleties of your garden at night.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2022 'Investors take stock of tech' FT.com 8 May.
