  "text": "<p>Being an Apple supplier is both a blessing and a curse. Anglo-German Dialog Semiconductor has striven to become less reliant on the smartphone maker by diversification. A takeover has long looked like the logical alternative. On Monday, Japan's Renesas Electronics announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70c42c08-cab2-4798-b50e-e2e06c2cf4c9\">€4.9bn cash bid</a>, pushing up Dialog's shares by 16 per cent to €65 — just below the €67.50-a-share offer.</p> <p>Renesas will benefit from Dialog's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/882db73f-aedc-43dd-9cc6-2847958965a8\">design expertise</a>. It is one of the biggest chip suppliers to&#xa0;the automotive sector, which is becoming more demanding. But its balance sheet was already stretched. The deal will be funded by issuing new shares. Renesas's share price fell by nearly 4 per cent. </p> <p>Still, the price looks reasonable when held up against comparable deals. The enterprise value applied to Dialog is 3.8 times 2022 sales — a similar multiple to that paid by Infineon Technologies when it bought its US rival Cypress in 2019. </p> <p>Renesas is counting on the deal leading to additional revenue growth. Investors are often sceptical of cross-selling claims, though it is the case that semiconductor customers increasingly prefer to buy multiple components from the same vendor. </p> <p>The Japanese company has also pencilled in $125m per year of cost savings. Taxed and capitalised that would cover slightly less than&#xa0;half the premium above Dialog's average share price over the past three months. Shares have outperformed over that period, but this is owing to a mix of takeover speculation and strong demand from its biggest customer. </p> <p>Cross-border deals in the semiconductor industry are sensitive. Renesas — founded in&#xa0;2003 from three struggling chipmakers — knows that more than most.&#xa0;In 2012, a government-backed fund thwarted an attempt by rival US fund KKR to buy a majority stake in it.</p> <p>But Dialog — US-founded, UK-domiciled and Frankfurt-traded — is no national champion. Dialog would add less than 5 percentage points to Renesas's share of any of its markets, estimates UBS. The deal looks likely to go ahead, as part of a wider consolidation in the semiconductor industry.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
