  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Jeetu Patel --- A senior VP and the general manager of security and collaboration at Cisco",
  "text": "<p>Born and reared in India, Mr. Patel graduated from the University of Illinois in Chicago, where he majored in information decision sciences, a computer specialty at its business school.</p><p>He worked part time throughout college, including at a $4.25-an-hour internship at a startup called Doculabs. That led to a permanent job at the research and advisory firm following his 1994 graduation, and eventually an executive position there.</p><p>Later, he would land roles with increasing responsibility at EMC Corp., a major maker of storage products, and Box Inc., a provider of cloud-based collaboration software, before jumping to Cisco.</p><p>Mr. Patel says many mentors guided him, usually by being brutally honest, as he focused on creating work software with \"a massive impact.\" And when he confronts a dicey professional dilemma, \"they don't give me the answer,\" he goes on. \"They make me think about what the answer will be.\"</p><p>Here are four of his most valued advisers.</p><p>Jessie Saini</p><p>Vice president of business operations for a Cisco Systems Inc. unit</p><p>Ms. Saini was an infant when Mr. Patel met her during a childhood visit to America. They reconnected as adults. He recruited her for management roles at EMC, Box and Cisco. \"She can catch a mistake before I actually make it,\" he says. She often persuades him to reject skilled job applicants. She typically flags traits that will clash with their team culture -- such as product managers whose command-and-control mentality differs from Mr. Patel's philosophy that the best idea wins. \"Hiring the right people is critical to the success of your business and ultimately, your career,\" he says.</p><p>Jeremy Burton</p><p>CEO of Observe Inc.</p><p>Mr. Burton, one of Mr. Patel's EMC bosses, offered a suggestion that strengthened his leadership skills: \"Pick your battles.\" Figuring out which issues to fight is especially critical at large companies, Mr. Burton told him. At the time, Mr. Patel was CEO of Symplicity, a small firm that EMC had acquired, and he opposed fully integrating it with some other EMC units. Nevertheless, he accepted Mr. Burton's counsel, forging partnerships that helped Symplicity grow rapidly. Such experiences taught Mr. Patel to take a more measured decision-making approach \"based on facts as well as instinct.\"</p><p>Aaron Levie</p><p>CEO and co-founder of Box Inc.</p><p>The executives already knew each other professionally when the Box chief brought Mr. Patel to the company in 2015. Mr. Levie asked him to establish a platform business as its second product line. The unit aimed to simplify the technology Box provided to software developers. Its initial months were rocky, but Mr. Levie urged him to forge ahead. \"We will make this happen,\" the CEO repeatedly assured him. \"I don't know anyone with more fighting capacity than Aaron,\" Mr. Patel says. \"He just never gives up.\" The unit flourished within a few years.</p><p>Tor Myhren</p><p>Vice president of marketing communications for Apple Inc.</p><p>The pair got acquainted about five years ago when their daughters attended the same school. The advertising-industry veteran, who joined Apple in 2016, is known for rewarding edgy risk-taking by his staffers. He has given Mr. Patel insightful marketing advice. Mr. Patel recently showed him some new Webex commercials during dinner at his San Jose home. \"What is the core message that you want to come out?\" Mr. Myhren asked. \"Make it simpler.\" Mr. Patel's colleagues tweaked their message. The revised version \"hit the mark,\" Mr. Myhren told him.</p>",
