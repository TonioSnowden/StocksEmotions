  "text": "<p>   During their months stuck at home, some people may have fantasized about escaping to Hawaii. Katie Goates, a 39-year-old homemaker from Los Altos, Calif., spent her Hawaiian escape fantasizing about Salt Lake City, Utah. </p><p>   Ms. Goates and her family of six had fled their home in the Bay Area for an extended stay in a beachfront rental on the island of Kauai late last summer, after pandemic restrictions closed California schools, businesses and churches. Ms. Goates and her husband, George Goates, 41, who co-own a transportation company, were both born and raised in Salt Lake City, which from their vantage point on Kauai's Poipu Beach, was looking more attractive by the minute. </p><p>   \"My husband and I thought it was a good opportunity to come back to Utah. The economy was going well, school and school sports were going on, and our kids needed normalcy,\" said Ms. Goates. \"But there was nothing on the market -- competition was so intense.\" </p><p>   Ms. Goates wrote a letter to the owners of a five-bedroom Tudor with a guesthouse and pool in the upscale Salt Lake suburb of Holladay that had been briefly listed then pulled off the market. Just weeks after mailing her letter -- with a photograph of her four children enclosed -- Ms. Goates was flying from Hawaii to Salt Lake City to make an offer. In December, the Goateses closed on the home for $2.975 million. </p><p>   \"This is a great spot -- close to the city, but you feel like you are up in the mountains -- and more house than we could get in the Bay Area,\" she said. \"Our new home is over 6,200 square feet; our home in Los Altos was under 3,000 square feet, and we paid $3.6 million and put in another $150,000 to freshen it up. We were on a quarter of an acre there; now we have over an acre.\" </p><p>   Luxury home sales in the Salt Lake City metro area soared last year, propelled by buyers drawn to its family-friendly atmosphere, outdoorsy lifestyle and relative lack of coronavirus restrictions. There were 194 sales of homes priced at $1 million and above in 2020, a 32% increase over the previous year, according to a study conducted by Realtor.com. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) </p><p>   The luxury sector far outpaced the rest of Salt Lake City's market for single-family homes, which saw a 3.1% growth overall in 2020. </p><p>   That trend has continued. The number of sales of Salt Lake homes priced at $1 million and above during the first quarter more than doubled from the same period last year, from 17 to 38. Since 2015, the entry price-point for homes in the top 1% of the market has more than doubled, from $740,000 to $1.54 million. Those homes are in short supply. </p><p>   \"We could use more inventory -- when a home hits the market it doesn't last long,\" said Brett Sellick, an associate broker with Summit Sotheby's International Realty in Draper, who attributes the housing crunch to the rise of Zoom and remote working. \"People are coming from all over. It's an amazing lifestyle: hundreds of miles of bike trails, the best skiing on earth, plus the family values.\" </p><p>   At Tavaci, a gated community near Big Cottonwood Canyon, south of Salt Lake City, an undeveloped 1.18-acre lot recently went under contract for $1 million; a 0.88-acre lot there is listed for $895,000. </p><p>   Salt Lake City's urban center is drawing more home buyers as well. Available one- and two-bedroom apartments at City Creek, a cluster of three residential high-rises near downtown Temple Square that opened in 2012 with 425 condominiums, are priced from $499,000 to $1.7 million. The residential towers are part of City Creek Center, a 20-acre, mixed-use development by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that has drawn high-end retailers such as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany. </p><p>   \"We sold out in 2020 right before Covid, which was miraculous,\" said Chris Corroon of Axis Realty Group, a consultant on the project hired by City Creek Reserve, the church's real-estate development affiliate. </p><p>   Since her family settled in their new home, Ms. Goates has been surprised to discover that some of her new neighbors are old neighbors. At least 10 families that she knew from California are now living within a 10-mile radius, she said. \"A bunch of our friends have relocated for many of the same reasons.\" </p><p>   One of those friends is Marc Stanworth. A Salt Lake City native, Mr. Stanworth moved away about 20 years ago, settling in the San Diego area. Last year, he moved back to Salt Lake with his family to take a job as managing director of a real-estate development and investment company. </p><p>   \"I had sticker shock. I thought, 'We're going to be able to move there for $600,000 or $700,000 and have everything we want.' That's definitely not the case,\" said Mr. Stanworth, 44, who closed on a six-bedroom home in suburban Cottonwood Heights for over $1 million in September. \"Some of the suburbs were cow pastures when I was growing up. It's crazy how much that has changed.\" </p><p>   The growth of those suburbs is being fueled by people like Mike Eschrich, a finance manager for Apple. Last year at this time, Mr. Eschrich, 35, was hunkered down at his home in Santa Clara, Calif., with his wife, Leah Eschrich, a YouTube content creator, and their two children. </p><p>   \"We were all four of us living out of 900 square feet -- two bedrooms, one bath -- and it was intense. The work-life balance -- it was very difficult,\" Mr. Eschrich said of the family's Silicon Valley lifestyle. \"Apple said, 'Hey, you can work from wherever,' so that really got us thinking.\" </p><p>   Ms. Eschrich, 36, scouted out Salt Lake City and liked what she saw: inviting public libraries with story hours, microscopes and craft bags; new parks with water features; plenty of vegan restaurants. Although the couple had initially considered renting a home, last December they paid $780,000 for a six-bedroom house in SunCrest, a master-planned community on Traverse Ridge in Draper, after their real-estate agent recorded and uploaded a walk-through tour. </p><p>   \"Utah is completely underrated. The quality of life here, it's so much higher,\" said Mr. Eschrich, who is an ultramarathon runner and an outdoor sports enthusiast. \"I live on a mountain with the second-best parasailing and hang-gliding in the world, after the Swiss Alps. I can literally go hiking out my front door and within 5 miles be in an extreme environment with alpine lakes. And nowhere compares to it for mountain biking.\" </p><p>   Eric and Kristyn Kilcullen, who own Krush Kandy, an online fashion boutique, moved from Tucson to the Salt Lake Valley suburb of Bluffdale in January, paying $2.7 million for a six-bedroom house with an indoor slide and an indoor basketball court, as well as a second kitchen for entertaining. Mr. Kilcullen said their relocation was inspired by Salt Lake City's friendliness to both entrepreneurs and large families. </p><p>   \"We outgrew Tucson,\" said Mr. Kilcullen, 37. \"Within 48 hours [in Salt Lake], we had more applicants for our business here than we did for nine months during the pandemic -- from our social influencer side, like models, to warehouse employment.\" </p><p>   The Kilcullens' four children are also seeing a lot more activity. </p><p>   \"We came from an older community where there were no children -- no kidding, none at all -- to a neighborhood where children are popping up in our backyard. It's like, 'Whose kid is this on the trampoline?' \" Mr. Kilcullen said. </p><p>   As for Ms. Goates, she has had an unexpected visitor pop up, too: a would-be buyer from California who made an unsolicited offer on her new home that was about 25% above her purchase price. </p><p>   \"They offered close to $3.7 million,\" she said. \"George said no, but we did talk about how if we wanted to list it, we'd list it at $3.8 million.\" </p><p></p>",
