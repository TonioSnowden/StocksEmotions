  "text": "<p>   Pop star Rihanna has been tapped to headline the halftime show for Super Bowl LVII, the National Football League said Sunday. </p><p>   The singer will take the stage on Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz., for the live extravaganza, which is typically one of the most-watched parts of the NFL's annual championship game. </p><p>   Rihanna teased her coming performance on social media Sunday, posting a picture of a woman's hand holding a football aloft on her Instagram account. </p><p>   The NFL announced Friday that Apple Music is the new sponsor for the popular halftime show. Apple Inc.'s streaming service signed a multiyear deal with the league, replacing longtime sponsor PepsiCo Inc. </p><p>   The Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show will be produced by television production company DPS and Roc Nation, the entertainment company founded by Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter. </p><p>   Seth Dudowsky, the NFL's head of music, said the organization is looking forward to collaborating with Rihanna and the producers to create a historic halftime event. </p><p>   The nine-time Grammy Award winner follows other artists who have performed at the Super Bowl, including Prince, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, The Weeknd and Lady Gaga. </p><p>   Some 208 million people in the U.S. tuned in to watch some or all of Super Bowl LVI earlier this year. </p><p>   That halftime performance featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige and Eminem -- icons of 1990s and 2000s hip-hop culture. Kendrick Lamar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper, also performed. </p><p>   That production garnered five Creative Arts Emmy nominations and won three Creative Arts Emmys, including Outstanding Variety Special --Live, a first ever for the show. </p><p>   Jay-Z and Roc Nation helped produce that halftime show, as well as The Weeknd's halftime show for Super Bowl LV in 2021. Rihanna's 2023 live show will be the first partnership between Apple Music, the NFL and Roc Nation. </p><p></p>",
