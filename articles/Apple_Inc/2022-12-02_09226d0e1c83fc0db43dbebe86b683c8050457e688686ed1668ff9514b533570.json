  "text": "<p>“Andor”Though set in the pulpy “Star Wars” universe, there are no Jedi knights, Sith Lords or even mentions of the mystical “force”. Instead this 12-episode series (a second and final instalment is expected in 2024) focuses on the bureaucratic operations, negligence and oppression of the Empire and the way it sparked a commoners' rebellion that would eventually enlist Luke Skywalker. The result is extraordinary—and the best entry in this sprawling franchise since “The Empire Strikes Back”.</p><p>“Bad Sisters”Grace (Anne-Marie Duff) is married to an awful man—so awful, in fact, that her sisters refer to their brother-in-law as “The Prick”. Each of Grace's four siblings has a personal or professional reason to hate him. When his tormenting of Grace reaches its apogee one Christmas, they decide to act. Sharon Horgan, who co-wrote the show and stars in it, brings a dark wit to a script that captures sisterly dynamics perfectly. Sarah Greene (“Normal People”) is particularly enjoyable as the vengeful Bibi.</p><p>“Barry”Bill Hader, an erstwhile cast member of “Saturday Night Live”, is the creator, showrunner, star and lead director of this HBO show, which follows an assassin who takes up amateur dramatics. He hopes to covertly confess his guilt, but instead finds himself on a troubled path to Hollywood stardom. It is nominally a comedy (each season has been nominated in that category at the Emmys); but the show becomes increasingly dark as its protagonist's violent history, buried post-traumatic stress disorder from his time as a soldier in Afghanistan and burgeoning career endanger those around him.</p><p>“The Bear”Two stories released in 2022 captured the claustrophobia and chaos of a professional kitchen. Both “Boiling Point”, a British movie filmed in one continuous shot, and “The Bear”, an American series, focus on talented, troubled chefs who must wrangle unruly employees, a messy workspace and a business beset by financial difficulties. Christopher Storer's show stood out in depicting the gulf between the grim, hierarchical world of haute cuisine and the disorderly, unpleasant sandwich shop in Chicago to which the protagonist returns after his brother's death.</p><p>“Better Call Saul”Even in an era of endless franchise spin-offs, this prequel series was audacious. It had its premiere only a year and a half after the final episode of its acclaimed predecessor, “Breaking Bad”. Moreover the show made a protagonist from a bit-player, a criminal-defence lawyer. Yet “Better Call Saul” quickly proved that prequels can not only match expectations, but exceed them. In the final season Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould delivered a beautiful conclusion to Saul's story, as well as a critique of the past quarter-century of anti-hero television—“Breaking Bad” included.</p><p>More of our recommendations from 2022: • The best podcasts• The best films• The best albums• The best books</p><p>“Derry Girls”Another good thing came to an end this year: Lisa McGee's joyous sitcom. Throughout its three seasons, the show balanced teenage high jinks with poignant reflections on life in Northern Ireland in the 1990s. Its finale was a truly moving exploration of the impact of the Good Friday Agreement on its young characters' lives. The third series featured a brilliant soundtrack, hilarious set pieces (such as a fight over Fatboy Slim tickets) and an outstanding cameo from Liam Neeson.</p><p>“Hacks”This comedy-drama, about the professional relationship between two women from different generations, is more than the sum of its parts. In the second season Deborah (Jean Smart), an established stand-up, and Ava (Hannah Einbinder), an upstart writer, take their comedy set on tour across America. The intent is to hone Deborah's craft and confront her traumas, but the series also interrogates the cruelty and frailty of its two leads without judging either or forgetting to be funny.</p><p>“Pachinko”Adapted from Min Jin Lee's bestselling novel of 2017, this Apple TV+ series fits a great deal into its eight episodes (or “chapters”). It follows four generations of a family, jumping between Japan and its former colony, Korea, in the first half of the 20th century, and Tokyo in the late 1980s. The plot touches on prejudice, organised crime, gambling and the second world war. It never lags, thanks to deft storytelling, sumptuous cinematography and convincing performances.</p><p>“Severance”Imagine if your mind could be divided: surgically separated into two selves so that you might better “work hard” and “play hard”. That is the premise of this thrilling workplace dystopia, co-directed by Ben Stiller. Each element has been executed with the precision of a neurosurgeon; together the set design, editing, split-personality performances, writing and score highlight the internal conflicts of its characters. The result is a suspenseful examination of labour rights and the elusive quest for work-life balance.</p><p>“Slow Horses” Based on the spy novels by Mick Herron, this show goes beyond the usual trappings of British espionage dramas by mixing serious stakes with cynical humour. The titular “Slow Horses” are based in the dimly lit and dilapidated Slough House, a division of MI5 intended to punish failed and exiled intelligence agents by way of busywork. Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is their inebriated and belligerent taskmaster. With original music by Mick Jagger, this show is a welcome addition to a well-trodden genre.</p><p>■</p><p>For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</p>",
