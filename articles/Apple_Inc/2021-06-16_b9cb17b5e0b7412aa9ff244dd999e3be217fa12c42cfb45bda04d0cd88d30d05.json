  "title": "The Property Report:  Retail Rent Breaks May Last  ---  Leases tied to a  portion of sales look  poised to linger past  the pandemic  ----  By Esther Fung",
  "text": "<p>   During the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, many landlords offered deals where ailing retailers paid a percentage of their monthly sales in rent -- rather than a fixed amount -- to help them survive. Now, this once temporary way of charging tenants looks poised to outlast the Covid-19 crisis. </p><p>   More shopping-center owners are signing new leases where rent is tied directly to a portion of sales, at least for a period. These percentage-rent leases are especially attractive to newer retailers, offering some flexibility so they aren't saddled with large losses as they are starting out. </p><p>   While most landlords tend to prefer the reliability of a fixed monthly rent payment, the wider use of percentage leases reflects how much retail has become a renters' market. </p><p>   Many retail businesses have struggled with competition from e-commerce companies, then took another blow when they faced pandemic-related lockdowns. </p><p>   Some didn't survive, leaving landlords with excess space and compelling shopping-center owners to offer generous terms just to fill it. </p><p>   \"More brands are demanding it,\" said Philippe Lanier, principal at EastBanc, a property developer, owner and manager of dozens of open-air retail properties in Washington, D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood. </p><p>   The growing use of percentage leases is the latest instance where agreements or behavior that was once considered a temporary response to the pandemic looks more long term, or even a permanent fixture. For example, more companies are allowing employees to work from home, and food delivery is continuing to boom even as restaurants resume something closer to full service. </p><p>   Fixed-rent agreements aren't disappearing entirely.In most cases, percentage-rent agreements are limited to the first year or years of a lease, which would then revert to a fixed-rent model. </p><p>   Percentage leases also aren't without conflict. </p><p>   Tracking sales to determine rent levels can be a thorny problem, since tenants are typically reluctant to share their sales data with their landlords, unless they are asking for rent relief due to falling sales. </p><p>   \"Tenants love it; landlords hate it,\" said Michael Rielly, managing principal at Rielly Retail Solutions, a real-estate consulting firm for retail and hospitality brands. </p><p>   Still, landlords are trying to find ways to regain a measure of control, such as lowering the minimum amount of sales at which an owner can begin collecting a portion of that revenue. </p><p>   Many retailers see percentage-rent deals as a way to keep their costs manageable. This means more work though, including additional sales audits. Some landlords privately say they are bracing for litigation in coming years over sales data. </p><p>   Some of the more successful retailers frown on the percentage-rent model, preferring to keep any profits from booming sales to themselves. Apple Inc. and T.J. Maxx, for example, typically negotiate fixed rents, landlords said. </p><p>   But such retailers are asking landlords for bigger subsidies in fitting out new stores. These so-called tenant-improvement allowances are typically reimbursed to the tenants after they complete the store renovation, but some retailers are asking landlords themselves to pay for and oversee construction. </p><p>   \"Landlords are taking on more risks on behalf of the tenant,\" said Jahan Moslehi, managing principal at Bridge33 Capital, which owns dozens of shopping centers across 18 states. </p><p>   Landlords who undertake the construction work are now on the hook for fluctuations in construction and labor costs, he said. </p><p></p>",
