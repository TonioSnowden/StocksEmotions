  "title": "Here's everything new coming to HBO Max in April 2022 — and what's leaving",
  "text": "<p>Max's first legitimate hit series, the Emmy-winning comedy/thriller “The Flight Attendant” (April 21), is back for its second season. Kaley Cuoco stars as a — you guessed it — flight attendant who's now trying to stay sober while moonlighting with the CIA and getting caught up in international intrigue. Staying in the comedy/thriller genre, “Barry” (April 24) returns for its third season, with Bill Hader starring as a hitman who's trying to escape his violent past while following his dreams of becoming an actor.</p><p>Meanwhile, David Simon has a new show with his frequent collaborator from “The Wire,” author George Pelecanos. Starring Jon Bernthal and Jamie Hector, “We Own This City” (April 25) recounts the real-life rise and fall of a corrupt Baltimore police unit. “Tokyo Vice” (April 7) is another crime series based on a true story, as Ansel Elgort stars an American crime reporter embedded in the Tokyo police's vice squad who descends into the underworld of 1990s Tokyo. Ken Watanabe also stars, and the series is produced (and the pilot directed) by acclaimed filmmaker Michael Mann.</p><p>HBO Max, which is still owned by AT&amp;T Inc. T, until Discovery Inc.'s DISCA acquisition is finalized, also has Season 3 of the Emmy-winning comedy series “A Black Lady Sketch Show” (April 8); Season 2 of the dark romantic comedy series “Made for Love” (April 28), starring Cristin Milioti and Ray Romano; Season 2 of the gender-bending historical drama “Gentleman Jack” (April 25); the feature documentary “Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off” (April 5); the Holocaust drama “The Survivor” (April 27), from filmmaker Barry Levinson and starring Ben Foster; and Season 5 of the gentle yet compelling competition show “The Great Pottery Throw Down” (April 14).</p><p>Also: What's coming in April to Netflix | Hulu | Prime Video</p><p>More: What's worth streaming in April 2022 — and why Apple, HBO Max, Netflix are the must-haves</p><p>On the movie front, Max is adding classics like “Bettlejuice,” “On the Waterfront,” “Five East Pieces” and “William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet” (all April 1), along with newer hits such as “Death on the Nile” (March 29).</p><p>Here's the complete list of what's coming and going, as of March 28 (release dates are subject to change):</p><p>What's coming in April 2022</p><p>April
