  "text": "<p>   BUCHA, Ukraine -- The Russian troops arrived in waves in Bucha, each one crueller than the last, residents said, all seeking to hold this once-sleepy town outside Kyiv through fear, manipulation and coercion. </p><p>   The troops, a combination of infantry soldiers, paratroopers and forces associated with Russia's mercenary Wagner Group, set up headquarters in the town to prepare for the coming assault on Kyiv, said Ukraine's military and Ukrainian officials. </p><p>   The nerve center of their operations was a Soviet-era building on 144 Yablunska Street. Soldiers stationed there and in smaller outposts up and down the street guarded it fiercely, turning the leafy road that translates as Apple Street into the scene of some of the grisliest killings of Ukrainians that have come to light since the start of the conflict. </p><p>   The nondescript four-story office building on the town's southernmost stretch was one of the first sites where Ukrainians were questioned, tortured, killed or detained, according to Bucha residents and local officials. </p><p>   Nearly 100 soldiers were housed at 144 Yablunska Street, along with radio-electronic equipment used to control operations in Bucha and  the nearby towns of Irpin and Hostomel, said Ukrainian officials. </p><p>   More than 30 Russian military units came through Bucha, mostly from Russia's Far East and Siberia, including the 14th Separate Special Forces Brigade from Khabarovsk, the 38th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade and paratroopers from Pskov, in western Russia. </p><p>   Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said the Russians divided the city into several zones and worked through a list of some 40 names of local politicians and state officials who lived in each zone, detaining and killing those they found. </p><p>   He said he saw his name was at the bottom of the first of two pagesof names not listed in alphabetical order. The mayor managed to evade the Russians. Russian troops shot and killed the mayor of neighboring Hostomel as he was handing out aid to residents. </p><p>   When Mykola Zakharchenko, who worked as a security guard on the grounds of 144 Yablunska Street before the Russians arrived, was detained March 4 with another man, the grounds of the building were strewn with dead bodies. The two were led with their hands in the air to a side yard where the bodies of seven men who had been shot were lying face down in pools of blood. </p><p>   The Russian troops told them to look at the bodies, get on their knees and confess to being members of the Ukrainian resistance. </p><p>   Mr. Zakharchenko said he wasn't fighting and handed over his phone, a late-model iPhone his son had given him, so that the Russian soldiers could check the contacts and photographs. He watched a Russian soldierdownload the contents of his phone onto a computer and then look up his domestic identity number. The Russian officer asked him about time he had spent in the Russian city of Tula as a welder in 2018. </p><p>   \"We've seen your proletariat past,\" said the officer, who was wearing paratrooper gear according to Mr. Zakharchenko. \"Get inside.\" </p><p>   For the next four days, Mr. Zakharchenko lived in the headquarters' basement, a Soviet-era bomb shelter turned underground prison, with some 130 other people. They were given leftover food and military meals for days as the men, women and children struggled to find space to sleep. </p><p>   Over the next weeks, the Yablunska Street headquarters became chaotic. Blood from those shot and dragged from room to room stained the floors. Trash piled in the hallways, and bottles of beer and wine littered the floor. Human excrement piled up in buckets and on the floor. </p><p>   There was similar violence at other Russian bases on Yablunska Street and nearby. Russian soldiers took over one yellow, two-story house with an adjoining garage, where neighbors said people were led and shot. </p><p>   Northwest of 144 Yablunska Street, Russian troops holed up in buildings a few streets away from one another, one at 7 Ostrovsky Street and another at 104 Vokzalna Street, close to the site where Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian armored column the day Russia rolled into town. </p><p>   One Bucha resident who said she was inside theOstrovsky address described the soldiers who stayed there. \"They drank there,\" she said. \"They had fun there. They were having a party.\" </p><p>   She said many of the soldiers at the Ostrovsky building were young and frightened, brought to tears by the strain of the war. </p><p>   \"They wanted their mother,\" she said. \"They didn't want to fight.\" She added that they said they were forced to kill people. </p><p>    Russian troops took over a children's camp, digging trenches at its entrance. When the Russians left, local residents found five people there with their hands tied. They had been shot in the back of the head. Radio equipment and documents were left in another makeshift base. </p><p>   After the city descended into panic during the Russian troops' occupation, the town woke up one morning to find them gone. </p><p>   \"We were living in bomb shelters the whole time, we had no idea they had left until the shooting stopped,\" said Lidia, a cleaner at a church across the street from the children's camp. </p><p>   Some of the Russian soldiers who were in Bucha returned home to awards. The 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, one of the units that occupied Bucha, received one of the military's highest honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin following their withdrawal, turning it into an elite Guards Brigade. </p><p>   \"Putin knew about the atrocities his soldiers committed here and all he could say was 'good job,' \" said Mr. Fedoruk, the mayor. </p><p>   Moscow has denied targeting civilians in its military assault on Ukraine and called video and photographic images from Bucha staged. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Brett Forrest contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
