  "title": "The Quarterback's Gambit: Bengals Star Learns From Chess --- Game helps Joe Burrow with tactics, but he gets flagged for trash-talking",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Burrow, who plays under a pseudonym on his phone and keeps a signed copy of the chess novel, \"The Queen's Gambit,\" at home, is one of dozens of players who love chess so much that they use it to learn about football. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is a chess nut, as is legendary receiver Larry Fitzgerald. So is Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, who plays on a board that Mr. Burrow keeps by his locker.</p><p>\"He likes competition, there's no doubt about it,\" says his father Jimmy Burrow, who points out that Joe's love of the game is relatively recent. \"He mentioned there's a guy or two in the locker that's pretty good that can beat him. . . . I'm sure when somebody beats him, he probably begs them to death to keep playing over the whole season.\"</p><p>One trait that has served Mr. Burrow well on the football field has betrayed him on the chessboard. On the gridiron, he can be heard barking out plays even in the earsplitting noise of an opponent's stadium. In chess, Mr. Burrow's barking has occasionally gotten him banned.</p><p>As a chess player, it turns out, Joe Burrow is a trash talker. Pawn-pushers who tuned into a recent chess.com broadcast learned Mr. Burrow has more than once had his account on the popular website muted for cursing out opponents in the app's chat function when he loses.</p><p>\"Maybe sometimes he needs to hold back his emotions after he loses a game and not tell his opponents how he feels,\" Chess.com's chief chess officer Danny Rensch said on the broadcast. \"Pro tip for you, Joe. So that you don't get a warning from our support staff.\"</p><p>When it comes to chess, some of Mr. Burrow's teammates agree that the man who runs their offense can easily switch to causing offense.</p><p>\"We have been talking crap about chess right now,\" Bengals tight end C.J. Uzomah said over the offseason. \"We haven't played yet but he thinks he's good.\"</p><p>The Bengals declined to make Mr. Burrow available to discuss his chess game during the week of the Big Game. It is unclear if Mr. Burrow's counterpart in the Super Bowl, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, plays chess, and a team spokesman couldn't immediately clarify the matter.</p><p>By coincidence, there is a chess opening called the Stafford Gambit. While it's definitely not named after him, it could fairly describe his football game: quick, aggressive and susceptible to the occasional blunder (Mr. Stafford led the NFL in interceptions returned for touchdowns in each of the last two seasons).</p><p>Elsewhere in the league, quarterbacks are especially committed to the game, which makes perfect sense. No one has to play more metaphorical chess on the field than signal-callers.</p><p>They are responsible for laying out plays and changing them at the line of scrimmage. They have to look at 11 defenders and discern their intentions based on their alignments. They have to see into the future and make decisions based not on what is happening, but what could happen.</p><p>\"Football is chess on steroids,\" says private quarterbacks coach Quincy Avery, though not literally, per the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>Mr. Avery has been a quarterbacks specialist for years and has worked with the likes of the Houston Texans' Deshaun Watson and the Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Hurts. He trains them on the finer points of their throwing mechanics, balance, and footwork. And also chess.</p><p>Mr. Avery himself plays five games of chess every day and it's not unusual for him to incorporate the game into training sessions. Sometimes, he'll bring an iPad onto the field and they'll make moves between throwing sessions.</p><p>Joshua Dobbs was into chess long before he was a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was a member of a chess club all the way back in first grade.</p><p>To him, a defense that blitzes a lot isn't all that different from an aggressive chess opponent who tries constantly trading pieces. And in both pursuits, nothing can replace focused preparation.</p><p>\"If you wait until game day to actually train your mind to being in those stressful situations and thinking strategically, then it's tough,\" Mr. Dobbs says. \"But if you're able to constantly build that muscle throughout the offseason, throughout the year, and prepare your mind for the game, it just helps you be able to play the position more efficiently.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
