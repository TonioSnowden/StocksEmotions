  "title": "Technology:  Samsung Profit to Rise by 53%  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn",
  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects a 53% rise in operating profit for the second quarter, lifted by strong demand for memory chips that offset weaker device sales hurt by component shortages. </p><p>   The world's largest smartphone and memory chip maker forecast operating profit of 12.5 trillion South Korean won, equivalent to about $11 billion, for the quarter ended June 30. Samsung also projects revenue of 63 trillion won, up 19% from the prior year. </p><p>   The South Korean firm's outlook handily topped market expectations and showed continuing strength for technology companies and especially chip makers that have seen greater pricing power amid a supply crunch. </p><p>   A year ago, during the pandemic's first months, Samsung saw a double-digit percentage drop in revenue for electronics products like smartphones and televisions. But demand for components surged as people shifted more of their lives online. Results have remained strong since. </p><p>   Analysts' estimates gathered by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence were about 10.9 trillion won in operating profit and 61.2 trillion won in revenue. </p><p>   Samsung reports full earnings this month. The Suwon, South Korea, company is considered to be an industry bellwether because it is both a major electronics maker and a components supplier to the world's biggest tech firms such as Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp. </p><p>   Samsung is likely to see its smartphone shipments decline by 20% from the previous quarter, according to Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Securities in Seoul, in a recent note to investors. </p><p>   Part of that drop is due to Covid-19 outbreaks in growth markets like India, which sapped consumer demand. Some suppliers to Samsung's handset business have warned of production bottlenecks. </p><p></p>",
