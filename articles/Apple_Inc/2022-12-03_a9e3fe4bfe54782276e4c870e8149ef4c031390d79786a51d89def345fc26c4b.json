  "text": "<p>   Accounts vary about how many workers are missing from the Zhengzhou factory, with estimates ranging from the thousands to the tens of thousands. Mr. Kuo said it was running at only about 20% capacity in November, a figure expected to improve to 30% to 40% in December. One positive sign came Wednesday, when the local government in Zhengzhou lifted lockdown restrictions. </p><p>   One Foxconn manager said hundreds of workers were mobilized to move machinery and components by truck and plane nearly 1,000 miles from Zhengzhou in central China to Shenzhen in the south, where Foxconn has its other main factories in China. The Shenzhen factories have made up some, but not all, of the production gap. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Foxconn is offering money to get workers to come back and stay for a while. One of its offers is a bonus of up to $1,800 for January to full-time workers in Zhengzhou who joined at the start of November or earlier. Those who wanted to quit have gotten $1,400. </p><p>   India and Vietnam have their own challenges. </p><p>   Dan Panzica, a former Foxconn executive who now advises companies on supply-chain issues, said Vietnam's manufacturing was growing quickly but was short of workers. The country has just under 100 million people, less than a 10th of China's population. It can handle 60,000-person manufacturing sites but not places such as Zhengzhou that reach into the hundreds of thousands, he said. </p><p>   \"They're not doing high-end phones in India and Vietnam,\" said Mr. Panzica. \"No other places can do them.\" </p><p>   India has a population nearly the size of China's but not the same level of governmental coordination that can make it easy for companies such as Apple to operate. Apple has found it hard to navigate India because each state is run differently and regional governments saddle the company with obligations before letting it build products there. </p><p>   \"India is the Wild West in terms of consistent rules and getting stuff in and out,\" said Mr. Panzica. </p><p>   The U.S. embassies of India and Vietnam didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Nonetheless, \"Apple is going to have to find multiple places to replace iPhone City,\" Mr. Panzica said. \"They're going to have to spread it around and make more villages instead of big cities.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Selina Cheng contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
