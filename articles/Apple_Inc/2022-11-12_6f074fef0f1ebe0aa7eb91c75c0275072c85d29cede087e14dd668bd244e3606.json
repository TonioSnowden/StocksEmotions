  "text": "<p>If he decides to run, Mr. DeSantis isn't expected to announce a bid until after his state's legislative session ends in early May, people familiar with the early discussions said.</p><p>Republican activists in Iowa, where the party's presidential nomination process will start with caucuses in early 2024, said they are eagerly anticipating an eventual visit from the 44-year-old Florida governor.</p><p>\"I would love to see DeSantis run and would back him 100%,\" said Kevin Van Otterloo, a former GOP chairman in one of Iowa's most conservative counties. \"There are a lot of people who are tired of Trump and looking for something new, and DeSantis doesn't make everybody mad all the time.\"</p><p>But Mr. Trump is sticking with plans to try to lock in early support by announcing another presidential bid on Tuesday night, despite some pressure from supporters to delay that until after Georgia's Dec. 6 Senate runoff.</p><p>The former president's team has for months anticipated a challenge by Mr. DeSantis and would prefer that others get in the race so support in the non-Trump wing of the party is splintered.</p><p>Mr. Trump has wasted no time in going after the governor and Thursday night issued a lengthy statement attacking him as disloyal and taking credit for his political rise, thanks to an endorsement in the 2018 gubernatorial primary.</p><p>Recalling his own 2016 battle in a crowded primary field, Mr. Trump relished how he \"easily knocked them out, one by one. We're in exactly the same position now. They will keep coming after us, MAGA, but ultimately, we will win,\" he said, using his Make America Great Again slogan.</p><p>Despite not appearing on the ballot, Mr. Trump held dozens of packed rallies during the midterm election cycle, Such a following has fueled his small-dollar fundraising machine. His unconventional style and celebrity attracted new voters to the party and candidates up and down the ballot adopted his policies. Past predictions of his political demise, including in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, didn't materialize.</p><p>\"People love President Trump,\" said Michael Barnett, chairman of the Palm Beach County GOP, adding he thinks there's a place in the party for both men. \"I love DeSantis. We worked our hearts out for him. However, we love him for governor and for president in 2028. I think he needs to wait his turn.\"</p><p>The DeSantis campaign declined to comment.</p><p>The governor has sketched a second-term agenda that includes targeting what he calls \"woke capital\" -- entities that are part of the environmental, social and corporate governance movement -- and has alluded to passing a law allowing people to carry concealed guns without permits. He faces pressure from some advocates to further restrict abortion access in Florida, though he avoided the topic during the heat of his recent campaign after signing a 15-week abortion ban in April.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has proved to be a master of online fundraising, the party's more-establishment-minded big donor community could give a boost to Mr. DeSantis, should he enter the race.</p><p>\"DeSantis's victory will accelerate his momentum,\" said Chart Westcott, a Dallas-based investor and longtime GOP donor. \"Trump remains the most important national figure in the party. However, it is now indisputable that DeSantis is right behind him and offers activists, donors and voters an alternative to Trump.\"</p><p>Some of Mr. DeSantis's advisers and supporters think he should seize the opportunity and run now for the White House. He is among a group of potential 2024 GOP presidential candidates scheduled to speak next week in Las Vegas at the annual leadership meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition. Mr. Trump has spoken to the group in the past, but isn't on this year's schedule.</p><p>Other possible presidential hopefuls include former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.</p><p>Brian Ballard, a lobbyist with close ties to Messrs. Trump and DeSantis, said the governor's win will have lasting effects in a state that delivers more than a tenth of the total electoral votes needed to win the presidency.</p><p>\"He forged new voter coalitions, and he pierced the South Florida stranglehold of Democrats,\" Mr. Ballard said. \"And he's shown the national Republican Party how to win in what had up to now been a traditional purple state.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Early Rising Stars</p><p>Get No Guarantees</p><p>Ron DeSantis's victory over Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor of Florida who later became a Democrat, was a rout. But there's no guarantee his stock will keep rising.</p><p>Other GOP governors in recent presidential nomination races -- including Jeb Bush of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin -- were also seen as hot prospects, before seeing their campaigns collapse.</p><p>Still, Mr. DeSantis won 62 of Florida's 67 counties and became the first GOP candidate for governor since 2002 to win Miami-Dade County, which is majority Hispanic. Statewide, Mr. DeSantis won more than half of the Latino vote, according to an AP VoteCast survey.</p><p>After winning his second term by 19 percentage points, Mr. DeSantis delivered a victory speech that underscored his political ambition. His supporters gathered in Tampa responded with chants of \"two more years\" -- a reference to the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>So far, Mr. DeSantis hasn't engaged in a back and forth with the former president.</p><p>\"DeSantis has the high ground coming off a fantastic win this past week, and if he were to start engaging in counterattacks or responding to Trump, then he'd only be lowering himself into all the muck,\" said Ron Bonjean, a GOP strategist. \"If he takes the bait on all these attacks that Trump is trying to escalate, a lot of people will be turned off by it.\"</p>",
