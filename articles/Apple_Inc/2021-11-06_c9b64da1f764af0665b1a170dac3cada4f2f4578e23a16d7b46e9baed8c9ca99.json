  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Gear & Gadgets: How to Kick a Smartphone Addiction: Make Your Screen Bleak --- Seeking to limit our doomscrolling habit, we tested the trendy, celebrity-endorsed hack of switching to a grayscale screen. It (sort of) worked.",
  "text": "<p>\"Many don't realize how much deliberate color psychology goes into app design and development,\" said Carissa Lintao, an ethicist at the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology. \"Turning off all colors is one way to strip your app usage down to the basics, because grayscale doesn't engage us as well as color does.\"</p><p>To enable the mode on an iPhone, go to accessibility settings, then to display and text size, and flip the color filter toggle to \"on.\" Directions vary for Android models, but YouTube offers videos that will walk you through the steps.</p><p>Other chronic scrollers have found success adopting the black-and-white tactic. Aiva Strelca, a copywriter in Riga, Latvia, struggled to fall asleep in the pandemic's early months, and resorted to exploring Pinterest into the wee hours. \"It was a crazy [phone] addiction, I didn't really know what to do,\" said Ms. Streica, 25. Setting her Android to switch to grayscale mode 30 minutes before bedtime proved a cure. \"In grayscale my phone just wasn't that interesting anymore,\" she said. Candice Criscione, 41, a travel planner in Florence, Italy, whose phone habits were robbing her of time with her sons, concurs: \"It definitely isn't fun to look at Instagram if it's in black and white.\"</p><p>But would switching my own phone to grayscale for a week prove just as helpful?</p><p>First, the good news: My phone use dropped by 11% compared to the week prior, according to Screen Time, the iPhone function that tells you how much time you're spending on your device and what you're doing.</p><p>The bad: Even with that 11% reduction, I still clocked an average of 6 hours a day. And, since I sort my apps by color, I struggled to find tools I actually needed. When driving, I found using Google Maps without color borderline dangerous -- there just wasn't enough contrast. More frivolously, I didn't appreciate the unintentional artiness of the photos I took. (Switching my display back to full-color revealed their true hues.)</p><p>In the end, my own lack of self control undermined the experiment. Every night after a long day of grayness, I snuck into my settings and guiltily toggled my way back to the full spectrum. The call of \"SortPuz,\" a soothing color puzzle game, was just too strong.</p><p>---</p><p>For more screen-time-reducing strategies, go to wsj.com/tech</p>",
