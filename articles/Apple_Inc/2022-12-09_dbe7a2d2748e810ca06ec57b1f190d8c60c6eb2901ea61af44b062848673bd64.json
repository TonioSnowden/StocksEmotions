  "text": "<p>Covid-19 had a profound effect on workplaces and how they are managed. Now the world is changing again, and companies face not only lingering effects of the pandemic but talent shortages and concerns about a recession.</p><p>At The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit, the Journal's Thorold Barker spoke with Adam Grant, the Wharton School's Saul P. Steinberg professor of management, a professor of psychology and bestselling author, about how work and leadership have changed in a post-Covid world.</p><p>Edited excerpts of their conversation follow.</p><p>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Elon Musk is doing a real-time business transformation case study with Twitter. So, what are the Musk management lessons, good and bad?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: With that Twitter thread about whaling and culling, he was sort of deliberately trying to find out who's loyal, who's committed, who's capable. I know it's a strategy that's been, in some ways, effective for him in the past. If you are a space engineer, SpaceX is the place to work. If you're anything in the realm of mechanical or automotive engineering, Tesla is a very coveted job. I don't think Twitter has the same cachet as a job in Silicon Valley. And so I don't know if it's going to work as well.Everybody has complained about a lot of things he's done. One of the things I really respect about Elon's leadership is he does think like a scientist. I would like to see him think like a more systematic and rigorous scientist. When he says, like, \"This is a trial. It may not work. We're going to do a lot of dumb things,\" that's leadership.</p><p>WSJ: In Silicon Valley, you've got this sort of hard-charging Elon Musk approach, and at many tech companies, you've got that slightly softer sushi-bar, softball approach. How do you compare those in terms of results?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: I don't know that I would call the Google approach \"soft.\" It is a device for getting people to stay late in the office, right? It's been fairly effective from the data I've seen on that.</p><p>When we compare these management styles, what I always think of is system dynamics. There's a principle of equifinality. It basically says there are multiple paths to the same end. And I think leadership is that way. There's not one style that's effective. There's not one structure that's effective. There is not one ideal culture. It all depends on what goals you are trying to achieve.</p><p>If you were to contrast Google with an Apple, which has historically been much less warm and fuzzy, shall we say, they're in pretty similar industries, but they have different value systems. And both of those models have worked for their respective goal sets.</p><p>WSJ: Job cuts are in the air in Silicon Valley after some pretty aggressive hiring over the past few years. Is the question for management now, how deep can you sensibly go without destroying things?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: I think so. If you look at the science over the last few decades on downsizing, you look at thousands of firms that downsized, you compare them to peer firms that chose different ways of managing costs, like for example taking pay cuts, and the researchers conclude that downsizing is, quote, \"dumb and dumber.\" It predicts consistent and significant decreases in profits, return on assets.</p><p>There are a few things with downsizing probably we underestimate the cost of. In roughly half of the cases, maybe more, you end up having to rehire people that were indispensable and you didn't realize it. Two, there is a huge problem with survivor guilt. You see a big drop in people's motivation. They also tend to narrow their attention, they try to focus narrowly on basically not getting fired, as opposed to doing the kind of innovation you need in tough times.</p><p>And then fourth, there's a major problem with bleeding talent. The most talented people have the most options. And so they're the first to jump ship when they see the writing on the wall. I'm not saying those costs can't be managed carefully, but if you think about then the risk of not being able to attract or retain your most talented people, losing the motivation and the creativity of your most talented people, those are intangible costs that are hard to measure, and they're usually underestimated until it's too late.</p><p>WSJ: It's been tough to get talent in, and the economy looks a bit more uncertain. How are the people you talk to thinking about this?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: The most interesting idea I've heard so far is the idea of job sharing. If you think about a job, it's a bundle of tasks designed to be performed by one employee. Well, who decided that that one job should be one person's? I think a lot of talented people are rethinking and re-evaluating their lives. Some will be really thrilled to do half of a job two and a half, or three, or four days a week.</p><p>And I'm starting to see a few leaders talk about this and ask, \"You know, could we take two really great people that we can trust who would be very hard to recruit but would each love to do half-time work?\" And I think that's the kind of creative thinking I'd be thrilled to see more of.</p><p>WSJ: You've talked about a four-day week being a good idea, at least to pilot and experiment with. Can you tell us why?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: The four-day week is an experiment worth running. A lot of you are currently working six or seven days while your employees work five. If they work four, you could go down to five or six. How great would that be? You might have a life. We've seen a lot of four-day pilots. In every single trial that's been run, every performance-related outcome we can measure is either sustained or improved. People are also much more loyal. If you give somebody a four-day workweek, they do not want to leave you for a company that's offering them five.</p><p>We ran a six-day workweek in the U.S. a century ago, until Henry Ford came around and shortened the workweek. Henry Ford was not known for his enlightened views on management, or his concern for human beings.</p><p>What he discovered was when you shorten the workweek, people made fewer errors, they tended to work harder and focus more on the time they had, and they were net more productive. And if I were a leader, I would be much more excited about 32 focused hours a work than I would 40 distracted hours.</p><p>WSJ: Do people actually work four days or do they do more?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: That seems to depend on the culture of the company. In the trials that I've seen good data for, most of the companies committing to it are serious about it. The most common choice is Fridays are off for everyone.</p><p>There's a significant increase in people spending time on hobbies and leisure. They also exercise more, it turns out. So if you care about employee health at all, that's a solid case. Sleep improves is another finding.</p><p>WSJ: How do customers respond if the company shuts down on a Friday?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: That's a good question. I don't think that customer-facing companies have committed to the Friday off for everyone. They've basically adopted shift work and said, \"We're going to give people shifts that cover the whole workweek.\" That seems sensible, if you're in a service industry.</p><p>WSJ: Do you think this will happen, broadly?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: No. Definitely not. It's more likely now than pre-Covid. During, I think, 2020 to 2021, there was at least one job-posting site that saw four-day-work-week job postings had tripled. But they were still fewer than 1% of all jobs.</p><p>So I don't know that this is going to be mass adopted. Maybe in Europe, where people actually value life outside of work, but I think that it's the kind of experimentation that allows people to learn a lot. And I think that often, you are surprised.</p><p>WSJ: To what extent have the pandemic and the mental-health issues it generated changed work practices?</p><p>PROF. GRANT: One of the things that surprised a lot of psychologists, and I say this as a psychologist, looking at U.S. and U.K. data, there was an increase in mental-health problems in the acute phase in the pandemic.</p><p>By summer 2020, people had rebounded. We have a pretty robust psychological immune system that can go haywire, but does not, by default, operate in malaise for extended periods.</p><p>What's happened since then? We're still tracking the data, but it seems to be the case that a lot of people burned out because they had to work longer hours, they had almost an impossible time setting boundaries.</p><p>The silver lining, if there is one, is that a lot of folks said, \"I need to make employee mental health a bigger priority.\" And we did start to see real organizational change. There's been growing recognition in the C-suite over the course of the pandemic that well-being matters, right?</p><p>What does that mean, concretely? I think we're just in the early days of tracking how organizational practices have changed. But one thing I saw, anecdotally, that I thought was profound was a manager who said to a team, \"It's OK to call in sick. It's also OK to call in sad.\"</p><p>It was the idea that we're going to normalize mental health as part of health. And just as you would be expected to take some time off if you broke your leg or if you got the flu, if you were burned out, if you were depressed, if you were anxious, that was being tolerated.</p><p>Adam Grant on What Makes an Effective Leader in a New Era</p>",
