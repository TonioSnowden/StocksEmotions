  "title": "Don't get fooled by another 'rip' says this strategist, who advises watching this 'battleground' S&P 500 level; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>\"Quickly, we have gone from a 'win-win' scenario for stocks to a 'lose-lose' scenario. In other words, 'buy the dip' has rapidly transitioned to 'sell the rip' as fear and uncertainty are being met by a strongly hawkish Fed and rather unstable economy,\" Kobeissi told clients in his latest newsletter.</p><p>In our call of the day, he laid out a \"battleground level\" on the S&amp;P 500 to watch closely — 4,090, which marks a lower high from May 17 and paves the way for a drop down to 4,050, he said.</p><p>With consumers getting hit by high inflation at every turn and oil prices hovering at $120, it's \"hard to view the current fundamental backdrop as bullish\" with likely more near-term pain for stocks, Kobeissi said.</p><p>\"In the case that the Fed begins to shift in a less hawkish direction, we believe that short-term rallies will be followed by longer-term selling as a less hawkish Fedbrings inflation back into the spotlight. At this point in time, we believe that we are likely in a recession, and if not it is certainly warranted,\" said Kobeissi.</p><p>He's got a 4,050 target on the S&amp;P and a stop loss of 4,160.</p><p>Less dour is RBC Capital Markets' equity analyst Lori Calvasina, though she has trimmed her end-2022 S&amp;P 500 target to 4,700 from 4,860. \"We are continuing to bake in a slower economic growth backdrop in 2022-2023 but not a recession,\" she said.</p><p>Calvasina said when it comes to sectors, analysts \"continue to be more intrigued\" with growth over value looking ahead, as most indicators look better for the former and are fading for the latter. Of course, she said this call may not work in the short term if U.S. equities \"take another leg lower and start to price in full recession.\"</p><p>For now, she is moving back to neutral on small-caps (from underweight) vs. large-caps. \"If it turns out that the U.S. avoids a recession and the U.S. equity market has bottomed, we'll look back at Small Cap's resilience in early 2022 as something telling us stocks had already priced in the economic damage that was around the corner and were attempting to find a floor.</p><p>\"On the other hand, if recession fears mount and equity markets take another leg down, Small Cap seems likely to underperform again in the very near term. But we'd view that as an opportunity to add to positions. Historically, there's one thing we know about recessions — they tend to be good entry points into Small Cap,\" said Calvasina.</p><p>The chart</p><p>U.S. stock valuations have dropped, but remain above levels seen during the dot-com peak, according to the Buffett Indicator, which Berkshire Hathaway's BRK.A Warren Buffett once dubbed \"the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\":</p><p>The long-term valuation indicator is a ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to gross domestic product.
