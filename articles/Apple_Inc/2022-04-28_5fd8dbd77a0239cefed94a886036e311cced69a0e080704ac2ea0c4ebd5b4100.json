  "text": "<p>(Hulu)</p><p>Dustin Lance Black, who won an Academy Award for writing \"Milk,\" and was raised in a Mormon household, takes on the limited series \"Under the Banner of Heaven,\" about a murder and Mormonism that's inspired by Jon Krakauer's bestselling book.</p><p>Mr. Black tells his tale about a grisly murder in an insular Mormon community with a mix of appreciation and criticism, interweaving three stories. The first is the 1984 murders of Brenda Wright Lafferty (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her 15-month-old daughter, Erica, at the hands of Mormon extremists, and how the investigation tests the faith of Detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield). The second is the story of the Laffertys, a large, devout Mormon family. The third is the history of the Mormon Church, particularly its roots in the 19th century.</p><p>\"There's great warmth in my heart for the focus on Mormon family and community,\" Mr. Black says. He takes issue with the church on issues such as how it views his marriage to his husband, and the way it affords different rights to men and women. Mr. Black notes that Mormonism isn't the only religion to grapple with those issues. But the show \"draws distinctions between cultural Mormonism, mainstream Mormonism, Mormonism of 1984 and Mormonism of the 19th century.\"</p><p>\"Under the Banner of Heaven\" is now streaming on Hulu.</p><p>New Release: 'Shining Girls'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>In the new thriller, \"Shining Girls,\" Elisabeth Moss plays Kirby, a woman who has struggled with a shifting perception of reality ever since she was cut up by an attacker.</p><p>Kirby thinks she lives, for example, with her mother, but comes home one day to discover that she actually lives on a different floor of her building—with her husband. Once a reporter, she is now (apparently) an archivist at a Chicago newspaper. When a woman is murdered in an attack that's similar to hers, Kirby begins working with a journalist (Wagner Moura) to help find the perpetrator.</p><p>Ms. Moss executive produces the show, which is based on the novel, \"The Shining Girls,\" by Lauren Beukes. She also directs a pair of episodes. The creators, she says, wanted the show to be enjoyable as a thriller and a mystery. But she adds, \"if you are so inclined, you can also examine the deeper thoughts we've 'Trojan-horsed' into the show,\" such as the way facts and reality can look different to different people.</p><p>\"Believing someone's story and listening to someone's story and their perspective is a big first step to understanding what makes us different,\" Ms. Moss says. \"But even more important, what makes us the same.\"</p><p>The first three episodes of \"Shining Girls\" begin streaming Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>New Release: 'The Miranda Obsession'</p><p>(Audible)</p><p>What do powerful men want? A new eight-part audio drama called \"The Miranda Obsession,\" is inspired by the true story of a woman who called herself Miranda Grosvenor, and cold-called some of the biggest names in entertainment in the 1970s and '80s, forming relationships with them over the telephone.</p><p>Rachel Brosnahan (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\") plays Miranda, who claims to be a Corvette-driving, jet-setting model. Over the phone, she lures men into relationships with encouragement, advice and someone they could talk to, including Hollywood bigwigs like Paul Schrader, Buck Henry and Billy Joel, who are voiced in the audio drama. The series takes place almost entirely in telephone calls. Trouble begins when a man who feels fooled by Miranda begins making threats.</p><p>\"I think one of the things that's so brilliant about Miranda is that she had this acute awareness of what the male fantasy was,\" Ms. Brosnahan says. In the series, \"part of the conversation we aim to have is one about fame and power, but also male loneliness, in particular, and what kind of void that leaves that would leave space for someone like Miranda to enter the picture.\"</p><p>\"The Miranda Obsession\" is available to stream for free to Audible subscribers.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>* \"The Offer,\" a new series based on the making of \"The Godfather,\" is streaming on Paramount+. To stream \"The Godfather,\" you can buy or rent it on services like Vudu and Amazon.</p><p>* The final episodes of the seventh and final season of \"Grace and Frankie\" drop Friday on Netflix. The ladies—played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin—taught the world many things. Here's what they taught us about retirement.</p><p>* The last seven episodes of the final season of \"Ozark\" begin streaming on Netflix Friday.</p><p>What to Watch: Mormon True-Crime in 'Under the Banner of Heaven' and More to Stream</p>",
