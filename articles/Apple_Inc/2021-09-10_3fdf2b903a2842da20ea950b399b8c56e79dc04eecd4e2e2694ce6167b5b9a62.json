  "text": "<p>The case was brought by Epic Games Inc., known for its “Fortnite” battle royale videogame, against Apple AAPLa little over a year ago. While the Friday ruling allows app developers to collect revenue from in-app purchases directly, it did not declare Apple an antitrust monopolist.</p><p>That App Store sidestepping gave investors in videogame-related stocks reason to celebrate, although shares pared gains slightly by the close.</p><p>App-monetization company AppLovin Inc. APP led the charge in Friday's rally, with shares closing 8.9% higher at $77.38. In August, the company said Apple's crackdown on ad data had a “muted” effect on its business and opted not to raise its outlook following a strong quarter.</p><p>Playtika Holding Corp. PLTK shares rose 6.1% to close at $28.26. Recently, Playtika said it was acquiring design entertainment company Reworks Oy in a deal valued up to $600 million.</p><p>Shares of Unity Software Inc. U, another player in the app-monetization business and also in the game-engine space, finished up 0.7% at $135.10. In August, analysts had praised Unity's ability to work around Apple's attempts to deny user data to app developers. Meanwhile, shares of Roblox Holding Corp. RBLX rose 1.8% to close at $87.88.</p><p>Read: People are still playing a lot of videogames, but how much?</p><p>Electronic Arts Inc. EA and Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI both finished around 2% higher, while Zynga Inc. ZNGA shares surged 6.3%.</p><p>More on the change:&#xa0;Apple loosens App Store payment rules for ‘reader' apps in another concession to developers</p><p>Trading at a 2% loss Friday was Take-Two Interactive Inc. TTWO, which late Thursday announced a four-month delay of new versions of its Grand Theft Auto franchise.</p><p>In the broader market, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX declined 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP finished down 0.9%, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV shed 0.7%.</p>",
