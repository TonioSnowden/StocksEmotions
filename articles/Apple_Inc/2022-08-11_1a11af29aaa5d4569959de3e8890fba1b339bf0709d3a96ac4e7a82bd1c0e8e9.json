  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 7 points, or 0.2%, to 4,217</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 climbed 65 points, or 0.2%, to 33,326</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 added 36 points, or 0.3%, to 13,428</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 535 points, or 1.63%, to 33310, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 88 points, or 2.13%, to 4210, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 361 points, or 2.89%, to 12855. The S&amp;P 500 is up 14.8% from its 2022 closing low hit in mid-June but remains down 11.7% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The positive reaction to a cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation report on Wednesday continued to reverberate across markets.</p><p>Hopes that the pace of price rises has hit a peak encouraged investors to believe the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in hiking borrowing costs and that consumer confidence can improve.</p><p>Traders have piled back into equities in response, particularly growth stocks that had been so badly hit in the market rout during the first half of the year, a move that has pushed the tech-heavy Nadasq Composite up 20.8% from its mid-June trough. The S&amp;P 500 was in line to open at its highest since May.</p><p>\"The softer than expected U.S. inflation reading pushed the market odds narrowly back in favor of a +50 basis point Fed hike in September…and delivered a significant boost to long-duration assets. Growth stocks beat their value counterparts across all the major regions,\" said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt.</p><p>Alex Pelle, U.S. economist at Mizuho, said in a note to clients: \"We do have some very preliminary evidence that inflation may be taking a step down from an underlying pace around 8% to the something closer to the 5% level. This is a level that will still keep the Fed hiking, but the July round of data—taken as given—gives the bulls an early win.\"</p><p>Also supporting the upbeat tone was a well-received earnings report from Walt Disney DIS, which helped the media group's shares bounce 5.9% in premarket action.</p><p>Overall, the second quarter earnings season has helped underpin the market. With companies representing 91% of S&amp;P 500 market capitalisation having reported, sales growth has been 15.1% and earnings growth 7.9% – surprising by plus 3.5% and plus 3.6%, according to Evercore ISI.</p><p>However, the latest surge in stocks may have left the market over-extended and vulnerable to a pullback. The CBOE Vix index VIX , an options-based gauge of expected S&amp;P 500 volatility, has dipped below its long-run average of 20, suggesting traders may be getting a tad complacent.</p><p>In addition, the S&amp;P 500's 14-day relative strength index, a closely watched momentum gauge is around 74, where any reading above 70 is considered overbought territory. The RSI for market behemoth Apple AAPLis 76, the highest since December.</p><p>Data due for release on Thursday include the weekly initial jobless claims report and producer prices, both set to be published at 8.30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>How are other assets faring</p><p>* Oil was again struggling, with the U.S. WTI crude future CL.1 down 0.7% to $91.31 a barrel.</p><p>* The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 2 basis points to 2.764%.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar index DXY fell 0.2% to 104.97 as traders priced in a less aggressive Fed. But a softer buck did not help gold GC00, which lost 0.6% to $1,083 an ounce</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced 2.3% to $24,410.</p><p>* Asia markets mostly got a lift from Wall Street's overnight surge with Hong Kong's Hang Sang HK:HSI adding 2.2%, though Japan missed out because of the Mountain Day holiday. In Europe the Stoxx 600 XX:SXXP was up 0.2%.</p><p>U.S. stock futures rally to three-month high amid peak inflation optimism</p>",
