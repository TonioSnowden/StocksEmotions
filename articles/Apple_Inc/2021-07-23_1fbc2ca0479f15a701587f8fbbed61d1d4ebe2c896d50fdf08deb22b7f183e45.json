  "text": "<p>Books Seditious</p><p>Hong Kong's national-security police arrested five people for allegedly conspiring to commit sedition through a series of picture books that portray sheep being targeted by wolves -- an allusion to China's crackdown on pro-democracy supporters in the city.</p><p>Hours after police detained five members of a speech therapists' union, police displayed three illustrated books that they say incited hatred against the government among children as young as four. The cartoons simplify \"political issues that kids wouldn't comprehend and beautifies criminal activities,\" Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah said. \"They're meant to poison the minds of children.\"</p><p>Described as teaching aids, the books were distributed through pro-democracy businesses, local political offices and online by the speech therapists' union, founded in November 2019 -- a time when some activists formed workers' groups as a way to organize protests against the government.</p><p>The books include one titled \"The Guardians of Sheep Village,\" which is set against the backdrop of antigovernment protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019. It depicts a malicious plot by the wolves to take over the sheep village and devour them all.</p><p>Thursday's arrests are part of an intensifying crackdown on dissent in the former British colony and were made on the same day that four former executives and journalists of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily appeared in court charged with violating the national-security law by conspiring to collude with external forces.</p><p>Police said they seized around 550 related publications during their search of the suspects' homes and offices, along with many pro-democracy fliers and protest-related figurines.</p><p>-- Joyu Wang</p><p>---</p><p>CHINA</p><p>Death Toll From</p><p>Floods Rises to 33</p><p>The death toll from severe floods in central China rose to at least 33 people, local authorities said, as they grappled with the fallout from record rainstorms and faced questions over their new flood-management infrastructure.</p><p>At least eight people remained missing as of early Thursday after rainstorms started pelting the city of Zhengzhou and surrounding parts of Henan province late last week, Chinese state media said, citing the provincial emergency-management department.</p><p>The floods have affected more than three million people across Henan and forced the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people, the official Xinhua News Agency said.</p><p>About 531,000 acres of crops have been hit and economic losses so far were estimated at 1.22 billion yuan, the equivalent of $188.6 million, Xinhua said. The severe flooding in Zhengzhou stirred debate on Chinese social media, where some users asked why the city had been badly inundated despite continuing efforts to improve its flood-control infrastructure.</p><p>In recent years, municipal authorities have been implementing a program to turn Zhengzhou into a \"sponge city,\" an urban-development concept that focuses on sustainable infrastructure -- such as green spaces and urban wetlands -- to help deal with heavy rains, store water and purify it for other uses.</p><p>-- Chun Han Wong</p><p>---</p><p>EUROPE</p><p>ECB Set to Keep</p><p>Rates Low Longer</p><p>The European Central Bank signaled that it would support the eurozone economy by keeping interest rates low for longer as a surge in Covid-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Delta variant triggers new social restrictions and weighs on the region's large tourism industry.</p><p>ECB President Christine Lagarde said the pandemic continued to cast a shadow over Europe's economic recovery, even if strong growth is expected over the coming months.</p><p>While a surge in prices has stirred fears the U.S. is entering an inflationary period, the eurozone has long been mired in low inflation, despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy.</p><p>The ECB said it won't raise its key interest rate, currently at minus 0.5%, until inflation moves closer to its target of 2%, and that it was willing to let inflation run hot to ensure it reaches its goal. That suggests the ECB won't start to increase rates until 2024 or 2025, analysts said -- a decade after the bank first cut its key interest rate below zero, in June 2014. The ECB had previously given a looser commitment to hold interest rates low.</p><p>-- Tom Fairless</p>",
