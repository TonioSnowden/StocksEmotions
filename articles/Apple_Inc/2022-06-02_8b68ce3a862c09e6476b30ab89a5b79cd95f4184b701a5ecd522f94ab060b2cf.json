  "text": "<p>In a bit of a rambling response, Moynihan made the point that the Fed's challenge to hike rates is because of a strong underlying economy. What makes the Fed's job tough right now is \"actually a good thing â€” low unemployment and good wage growth and good consumer spending,\" he said, according to a transcript from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>He was asked by Autonomous Research analyst John McDonald, who also quizzed Dimon, about the pressure bank stocks have seen. JPMorgan and Bank of America shares have each dropped 18% this year. Investors in the sector have been waiting quite literally for a decade to see interest rates rise, which would help margins, and now that they have, \"the party seems over before it started,\" McDonald said.</p><p>Moynihan said he understands the worries about recession, as he said credit costs will likely increase. But he said there isn't the volatility around outcomes that investors may fear.</p><p>\"Our [net interest income] grew strong from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, actually starting, second to third quarter last year,\" he said. \"We look at that year-over-year, it's $2 billion more NII per quarter before the rate structure is actually coming through the system,\" he said. He said the consumer is now catching up after activity was led by the commercial side.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The posterchild of meme stocks, GameStop GME, reported a narrower-than-forecast losswhile inventories surged.</p><p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE slumped after-hoursafter earnings and sales missed estimates.
