  "title": "'Native Land Acknowledgments' Are the Latest Woke Ritual",
  "text": "<p>University diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucrats are often the source of these incantations, and the statements aren't one-time institutional apologies. They are intended to be read by faculty and students at the start of all public events, and even appended to email signatures.</p><p>The statements are objectionable both in their content and their coerciveness. Like the practice of listing one's \"pronouns,\" they creep quickly into the mainstream from the academic fringe. As these deeply ideological declarations become a prerequisite for academic and other kinds of speech, the unwoke on campus will be only further silenced and isolated.</p><p>The statements, whose text varies from institution to institution, typically assert that Native Americans have been in the area \"since time immemorial,\" putting us in the realm of myth rather than history. In fact, Native Americans came to North America at various times, migrated and sometimes displaced each other. (Ironically, the phrase \"time immemorial\" comes from English common law, which firmly fixed it at King Richard I's accession on July 6, 1189.)</p><p>The statements often apologize for \"dispossession\" or for being present on \"stolen land\" or \"occupied territories.\" This doesn't necessarily mean the named tribes ever lived on the actual site of the university. Rather, it anachronistically conflates a people's presence in an area with ownership of specific property, and it equates grazing or hunting grounds with notions of political sovereignty. Conquest and migration have shaped the entire world, yet the French don't apologize for the Norman Conquest.</p><p>Another common theme involves pseudo-pagan tributes to the tribes' functioning in the natural order. My own university's statement begins by giving \"greetings and thanksgiving to these Potomac River life sources,\" an oddly spiritual incantation in the overwhelmingly secular atmosphere of the university. Native tribes are commonly called \"caretakers\" or \"stewards\" of the land, fetishizing Native Americans more than any athletic mascot could.</p><p>Acknowledgments of a much less intrusive and ritualistic nature are as American as apple pie. European settlers often kept local place names, permanently honoring the earlier inhabitants. More than half of U.S. states have Indian names (though lacking the complex and impractical pronunciations that many land acknowledgments now contain). These older practices were both respectful and organic, paying respect to the tribes without creating group guilt.</p><p>It's no coincidence that these land acknowledgments are proliferating at formal ceremonies, even as such patriotic rituals as the Pledge of Allegiance and the playing of the national anthem are under attack. They replace a concise affirmation of national pride with a dense confession of national original sin.</p><p>Most land acknowledgments are only recommended acts of piety, not obligatory devotions. But when a university recommends such statements at all events and suggests that professors include them in all course syllabi, websites and even email signatures, all but the bravest professors are likely to fall in line.</p><p>As the George Brown College incident shows, nominally optional woke rituals can quickly become mandatory. Mount Holyoke College requires all students, staff and faculty to make an acknowledgment at every public event or in any published material, with compliance policed by the DEI office. Some academic journals have begun encouraging or even requiring authors to acknowledge the \"traditional owners of the land\" on which their university is located.</p><p>The British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies has such a requirement (though the journal itself fails to acknowledge that it is published on the historic land of the Celts, Picts and other peoples). It also demands that authors from \"occupied land\" confess their locations, in the footnote usually used for thanking colleagues, in this manner: \"We acknowledge that the land on which this research was conducted is designated Occupied Palestinian Territory in international law, as reconfirmed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 in 2016.\"</p><p>That's the only example of occupied land the journal gives. But it seems we're all settlers now.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Kontorovich is a professor at George Mason University Scalia Law School.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Reading Between the Lines\" -- WSJ June 15, 2022)</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Debating the 'Land Acknowledgment' Craze\" -- WSJ June 18, 2022)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
