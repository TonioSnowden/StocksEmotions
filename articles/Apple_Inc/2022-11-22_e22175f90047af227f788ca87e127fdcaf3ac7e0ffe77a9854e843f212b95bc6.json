  "text": "<p>There are just three subcompact sedans left on the market for 2023. Chevrolet canceled its little Spark, which was the cheapest new car for sale in America in 2022. Hyundai HYMTF canceled its subcompact Accent for 2023 as well.</p><p>That leaves just the 2023 Kia Rio,the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage, and the 2023 Versa competing for the dollars of those who want basic transportation under warranty.</p><p>The recent pricing announcement means the Versa has taken the title of cheapest new car in America for 2023. The least-expensive Mirage starts at $16,245, while Kia KR:000270 Rio pricing kicks off at $16,550. Bargain shoppers should note, however, that the Rio has the longest warranty of the bunch.</p><p>See: The big question about new car prices: When will they go down?</p><p>It may also be the best-looking of the group. Subcompact sedans, as a rule, are not attractive vehicles. Automakers tend to design all their sedans to look similar for brand awareness. The face that looks right on a midsize car usually looks bulbous and comical when shrunk down to subcompact proportions.</p><p>Nissan designers have done a better job with the shrink ray than most.</p><p>The base Versa S remains spartan, but an S Plus package adds Apple AAPL CarPlay, Android Auto, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. The mid-level Versa SV now comes standard with an armrest and a wireless charging pad. The top-of-the-line Versa SR adds automatic climate control, a larger 8-inch touchscreen (it's 7 inches on other Versa trims), and a Wi-Fi hot spot. Base models come with a 5-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will go with the CVT continuously variable automatic transmission that's optional on the entry trim and standard on the others.</p><p>You might like: The 2023 Subaru Impreza review: It's all about the all-wheel drive</p><p>2023 Nissan Versa pricing:</p><p>Nissan also charges a mandatory $1,095 destination fee on all Versa models. </p><p> Model                     MSRP  Versa S (5-speed manual)  $15,730  Versa S (Xtronic CVT)     $17,400  Versa SV                  $19,020  Versa SR                  $19,720</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com. </p><p>This is now the cheapest new car in America, and one of a vanishing species</p>",
