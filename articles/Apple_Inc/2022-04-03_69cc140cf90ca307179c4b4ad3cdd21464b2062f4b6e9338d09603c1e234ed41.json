  "text": "<p>Electric vehicles help reduce oil consumption. Electric bikes not only minimise petrol use but human perspiration as well.</p> <p>The adoption of cycling as a mode of socially distanced exercise and travel has accelerated during the pandemic. At the same time, battery-assisted e-bikes have proliferated with the hope that a jolt of electricity can wean car drivers away from high frequency, short-distance trips to bike journeys instead. </p> <p>Venture capitalists see an opportunity. These e-bikes remain pricey with many models costing more than $1,000 and susceptible to the vagaries of the battery supply chain. But as the reimagining of urban and suburban mobility continues, e-bikes can form part of the plan for a carbon-lite world.</p> <p>According to data compiled by electric scooter share company Bird, <a href=\"https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bird-Investor-Presentation.pdf\">annual e-bike sales</a> between 2015 and 2019 increased from 130,000 to 353,000. That figure soared to 908,000 in 2020. Globally this market could reach a value of <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/26/2320409/0/en/Electric-Bike-Market-Size-2021-2028-is-Expected-to-Reach-USD-52-36-Billion-Exhibiting-a-CAGR-of-16-0.html\">$52bn</a> by 2028, an annualised growth rate of 16 per cent from today, according to research group Fortune Business Insights. </p> <p>Rad Power Bikes of Seattle, a prominent start-up, recently raised a venture capital round, partially backed by socially responsible funds, valuing its business at $1.65bn.</p> <p>Cycling purists may look down upon their e-bike brethren for relying on an artificial propulsion boost. In fact, most e-bikes qualify as <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/ebikes.shtml#:~:text=E%2Dscooters%20are%20allowed%20in,no%20greater%20than%2030%20MPH.\">“class 1”</a>, requiring riders to pedal themselves in order to receive the benefit of the electric charge. Such “pedal-assist” bikes can only reach a maximum of 20mph. One study found that e-bikers typically took longer trips, exerting themselves similarly to those using ordinary bicycles.</p> <p>The environmental benefit is notable as well. According to US government data, car trips under one mile add up to at least <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/what-if-we-kept-our-cars-parked-trips-less-one-mile\">10bn miles</a> a year, or 2mn metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Switching to e-bikes would reduce these.</p> <p>Still, the substitution has its risks. Powerful e-bikes, popular among speedy New York City food delivery drivers, can cause problems. Collision risks aside, more than <a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2022/01/ebike-battery-fires-delivery-workers-charging-stations.html\">100 accidental fires</a> in the Big Apple were attributed last year to the lithium ion batteries, sometimes of lower quality, that power e-bikes and e-scooters.</p> <p>Over time, the quality, reliability and affordability of e-bikes and their batteries should improve. That means we should see more of these zippy, electric two-wheelers on the road, some of them ridden by enthusiastic venture capitalists.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
