  "text": "<h1>The Weather Station — Ignorance</h1> <p>“This is what the songs are for,” The Weather Station's Tamara Lindeman sings on&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57aef341-cce1-4816-9939-3c71a3fe5edf\"><em>Ignorance</em></a>: “This is the dirt beneath the floor.” Climate change is the ugly truth below the surface of things in the Canadian singer-songwriter's album, which dramatises feelings of disavowal and guilt with high insight and skill. <em>Released by Fat Possum Records</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Nation of Language — A Way Forward</h1> <p>Yearnings that can't be met recur in the lyrics on the second album from New York trio Nation of Language, articulated in songs that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed7f3da8-d033-4ca0-90c7-1b7e4b425a19\">make you want to listen again</a>. This perfect pop loop makes connections between early 1980s synth-pop and 2000s NYC rock, like a new circuit being activated. <em>PIAS</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Tyler, the Creator — Call Me If You Get Lost</h1> <p>The year's best US rap album opens with Tyler, the Creator motoring to Lake Geneva in a Rolls-Royce for a dip. The Californian maverick's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93139ae3-d83a-49ec-a769-19727cc4517b\">bold beats and inventive rapping</a> prove no less refreshing. Themed around ideas of travel and freedom, his songs are unpredictable and gripping, the work of an auteur. <em>Columbia Records</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Little Simz — Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</h1> <p>London rapper Little Simz goes all out on&#xa0;<em>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</em>. The lyrics are a chewy mix of memoir, social commentary and fantasy, negotiated with single-minded intent by Simz. Made with the gifted producer Inflo, the music occupies a richly imagined space too, encompassing cinematic orchestrations, Afrobeat, classic soul and hard-boiled rap. <em>Age 101 Music</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6269a38-4119-4225-a4fe-cad02af969af\"><em>Little Simz: ‘I've never felt the need to be the loudest person in the room'</em></a></p>&#xa0; <h1>Loraine James — Reflection</h1> <p>Loraine James is a computer musician who makes inventive use of the oldest musical instrument in history, the voice. The Londoner's second album&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22e619ee-744e-47c1-aafd-52292fcc5755\"><em>Reflection</em></a> places rapping, spoken-word passages and singing by her and various guests in a glitchy, unpredictable electronic setting, a dreamlike combination of beat-making and songcraft. <em>Hyperdub</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Erika de Casier — Sensational</h1> <p>The first track on&#xa0;<em>Sensational&#xa0;</em>is “Drama”, the second is called “Polite”. The juxtaposition sums up the Copenhagen-based, Portugal-born singer's second album, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10259ed6-1ee5-403c-b562-0276b918bf0c\">a sleek exercise in slow-burning R&amp;B</a> that redeems tastefulness from the handbook of lazy critical pejoratives. There are no vocal somersaults or attention-grabbing beats, just stylish, compact songs. <em>4AD</em></p> <h1>Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra — Promises</h1> <p>It's usually easier to make a promise than keep it. Taking five years to complete, <em>Promises</em>&#xa0;wasn't easy to make — but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c00c0655-013d-4d3b-8c7c-bf7dea47c1fc\">it fulfils its potential magnificently</a>. Led by electronic musician Floating Points, its nine movements feature delicately weighted sax solos from jazz great Pharoah Sanders and handsome orchestrations from the LSO. <em>Luaka Bop</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Pauline Anna Strom — Angel Tears in Sunlight</h1> <p>The first album of new material from San Francisco ambient musician Pauline Anna Strom in more than 30 years sadly became a posthumous release following her death in 2020. Its synthesised chimes and pulsing electronic rhythms pick up the threads of her earlier recording career, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14e2bdc2-7a2b-4349-9194-19808b2e72d4\">a cosmic-music masterclass</a>. <em>RVNG Intl</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Bicep — Isles</h1> <p>Contrary to its title, Bicep's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cb51fd5-8717-48cc-8234-39552acf4720\"><em>Isles</em></a>&#xa0;isn't insular. “Atlas” features a vocal sample of the late Israeli singer Ofra Haza, while “Apricots” has samples of Bulgarian and Malawian vocalists. Belfast duo Andrew Ferguson and Matthew McBriar create an expansive dance-music setting for these voices, not blandly globalised but outward-looking and dynamic.&#xa0;<em>Ninja Tune</em></p>&#xa0; <h1>Sleaford Mods — Spare Ribs</h1> <p>Austerity, Brexit, coronavirus: the harsh ABC of modern Britain meets a fine pair of lexicographers in the form of Sleaford Mods. <em>Spare Ribs&#xa0;</em>finds the Nottingham duo <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd3d1c54-a801-41d2-89fe-b3b7d21e5e0c\">at the height of their powers</a>, making the best of a bad lot with profane lyricism (Jason Williamson) and remorselessly itchy beats (Andrew Fearn). <em>Rough Trade</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b6a9294-304c-11e9-8744-e7016697f225\"><em>Sleaford Mods' Jason Williamson: ‘Nothing shocks anybody any more'</em></a></p> <p><em>All albums are available on Spotify, Apple Music and other digital platforms</em></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2021 'Top 10 pop albums of 2021' FT.com 20 December.
