  "title": "Business World:  Lina Khan's Microsoft Temptation  ----  By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",
  "text": "<p>   Would the public be served by a government lawsuit to block Microsoft's proposed $69 billion purchase of game maker Activision, owner of the popular \"Call of Duty\" franchise? Investors who've been bidding down Activision's stock apparently fear such a case is about to happen. </p><p>   If so, the record isn't only unpromising, it suggests an antitrust machine running downhill toward decadence. Only the 1982 AT&amp;T breakup produced a clear payoff for the public, dismantling a long-distance monopoly fostered by public policy. The yearslong government pursuit of Microsoft and, before that, IBM cost millions and famously ended in whimpers. This column once amused itself with federal lawsuits alleging monopolization by \"superpremium\" ice cream makers or office-supply stores. All had their defenders but none were so tasteless as to claim the American people would notice any benefit from these cases. </p><p>   A distinctly new era of ridiculousness, though, may have been inaugurated with the Trump administration's failed case to break up the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, a meritless lawsuit launched (and disposed of by the courts) for political reasons that only began with then-President Trump's animus for CNN (a Time Warner cable channel). </p><p>   Is Lina Khan, the Biden administration's Federal Trade Commission chief, about to commit a similar folly over Microsoft's videogame deal? </p><p>   She owes her position to a graduate-school paper she wrote decrying Amazon as an antitrust threat; she was hired to fulfill a Biden woke talking point about Big Tech. But though the Activision deal qualifies as big and Microsoft qualifies as tech, a case would hardly fit the bill in any other way. In desperation, advocates of a lawsuit point to Microsoft's incentive to make certain games exclusively for its own Xbox platform. But even so, Microsoft would have every incentive also to make games for rival platforms and the world's six billion-plus smartphones. How is this even a fit concern for the coercive powers of the state? </p><p>   Ms. Khan is perhaps supple enough of mind to be rethinking already her youthful priors as a result of the demand she's feeling to bring an ill-advised lawsuit. Maybe she will become a libertarian (antitrust has that effect on people when seen up close). </p><p>   If so, there may yet be hope for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the other bookend of Washington's antitrust obsession with big tech. </p><p>   Years ago, Ms. Klobuchar also got off to a precocious start with a college paper that became a book on the horse trading behind the Minneapolis Metrodome, which left an impression of an adult with an adult's sense of politics and the public good. Ever since, admirers have waited for her to justify her early promise and also the occasional briefing book thrown at the head of an underling. </p><p>   Lately, along with presidential ambitions, she acquired an interest in antitrust vs. Big Tech and it's easy to see why: It's populist in an upper Midwestern sense, without being too populist. It's wonky and esoteric enough to meet her up-market image, yet with an undercurrent of envy directed at uppity West Coast technology billionaires. </p><p>   Unfortunately, the book she published last year, \"Antitrust: Taking On Monopoly Power From the Gilded Age to the Digital Age,\" lacks any of the bouncy, brainy and mercifully unpreachy quality of her Metrodome book. It devolves into a witless campaign document in which the fight against monopoly is literally a fight about everything -- gender equality, racism, inflation, wage stagnation. </p><p>   The companion legislation she introduced in the Senate is even worse: a procrustean dagger aimed at the ability of software-based companies, from Apple and Google to Facebook and Microsoft, to evolve their platforms to address new markets and new uses. In a technology universe where change happens even faster than it did in the days of the Microsoft and IBM antitrust cases, her bill amounts to terms for surrendering America's tech leadership to China, Europe or anybody who wants it. </p><p>   In case you haven't noticed, few of the 100 people serving in the Senate at any time end up leaving much of a mark. As to whether Ms. Klobuchar will break the curse, I guess we'll keep waiting. But here's a question: How much longer can the country afford to lure so many of its promising talents into a life of purposeless paper-pushing and legalized economic vandalism that antitrust has become? In the busybody work of the postwar regulatory state, trustbusting has steadily declined into one of the most consistently unproductive activities of the U.S. government. If it didn't hit rock bottom with the Trump administration's embarrassing lawsuit to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, it may do so with a Biden administration lawsuit to stop Microsoft from acquiring Activision. </p><p></p>",
