  "text": "<p>Unilever launched a €3bn cash return after its first quarter sales beat expectations.</p> <p>The maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Magnum ice cream said it would start buying back shares in May and complete the programme by the end of the year.</p> <p>Underlying sales grew 5.7 per cent for the first quarter, exceeding the 3.9 per cent that analysts had predicted, thanks in part to 9.8 per cent growth from the company's foods and refreshment division. Easing global lockdowns helped boost ice cream sales while a marketing push lifted demand for mayonnaise.</p> <p>The cash return “reflects our strong cash flow delivery and balance sheet position,” the company said.</p> <p>The group said full-year sales growth would come in within its target range of 3 to 5 per cent, with the first half at the high end of this range.</p> <p>“This all feels positive in the round, but we observe that the market has been disinclined to treat first-quarter beats too effusively,” said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>First-quarter earnings from <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> beat consensus expectations as higher oil prices and chemicals margins offset a weaker performance in the refining and marketing business. The oil company said net income adjusted for one-off factors and cost of supply — its preferred profit measure — rose by 13 per cent year on year to $3.2bn, exceeding an analysts' consensus estimate of $3.1bn. The company confirmed an earlier pledge to raise the quarterly dividend by 4 per cent to 17.35 cents a share.</p> <p><strong>Smith &amp; Nephew</strong>, the medical devices maker, reinstated its 2021 guidance after reporting first-quarter revenue up 11.5 per cent to $1.1bn. Stripping out foreign exchange benefits and acquisitions grew 6.2 per cent for the quarter, helped by a return of elective surgeries and improved commercial execution, it said. Assuming that trading conditions will improve though the year, Smith &amp; Nephew targeted for 2021 revenue growth in range of 10 to 13 per cent and a trading profit margin of between 18 and 19 per cent.</p> <p><strong>NatWest</strong> reported a pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year of £946m compared with £519m in the same period last year. Similar to peers, the lender reversed some of the provisions for bad loans booked at the height of the coronavirus crisis, adding back a net impairment credit of £102m. “Defaults remain low as a result of the UK government support schemes and there are reasons for optimism with the vaccine programmes progressing at pace and restrictions being eased,” said Alison Rose, chief executive. “However, there is continuing uncertainty for our economy.”</p> <p><strong>St James's Place</strong> reported a record £135bn in funds under management for the first quarter, up about 5 per cent since the start of the year, with quarterly net inflows of £2.9bn, a 22 per cent increase over the corresponding period in 2020. “The moderate growth in new business that we saw in the early weeks of 2021 gathered pace through the quarter as confidence improved and clients sought to commit accumulated savings to longer-term investments,” the asset manager said. </p> <p>Sector peer <strong>Schroders</strong> said in a brief update that total assets under management were £672bn at the end of March, up 1.4 per cent since the start of the year. </p> <p><strong>Flutter</strong>, owner of Paddy Power and Sky Betting and Gaming, said US revenue in the three months to the end of March rose 135 per cent to £288m. The bookmaker said that its US business now has twice the number of customers as its longstanding Australian brands.</p> <p><strong>Howden Joinery</strong>, Britain's biggest kitchen supplier, said improved volumes and pricing meant UK revenue grew 47.1 per cent year on year in the 16 weeks to mid April. The company said it remained on track with its plans for the year.</p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong>'s first-quarter production report and full-year guidance matched expectations, with a drop in coal production partially offset by improved output of copper and ferrochrome. The commodities group said also that based on the first-quarter marketing performance, pre-tax earnings from that division will be within the top half of its long-term annual target of $2.2bn to $3.2bn<em>.</em></p> <p>Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> said first-quarter production was down 1.7 per cent versus the previous quarter on unscheduled downtime. Reduced steel availability meant total product sales dropped 9.9 per cent quarter on quarter. </p> <p>Semiconductor company <strong>Alphawave IP </strong>confirmed its intention to float in London next month with an offer to raise gross proceeds of approximately $500m in addition to sales by existing shareholders. It targeted a free float of at least 25 per cent on admission with a further 15 per cent of the offer made available for sale by existing shareholders via a price-stabilising greenshoe option. </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Fresnillo</strong> chair Alberto Baillères is stepping down from the Mexican silver miner with immediate effect, to be replaced by his son Alejandro Baillères, currently deputy chair. The 89-year-old Baillères senior has been invited to become the company's honorary president in recognition of his contribution to the group, it said.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b7b284a-a280-4252-bcc7-0fb6a4ef5d92\">warned that the deepening global chip crunch</a> was disrupting the manufacturing of its smartphones, televisions and home appliances as it reported first-quarter profits. The South Korean technology group said it was looking to build a new chip foundry in the US to meet surging semiconductor demand. <strong>Apple</strong> warned the shortage of chips would slow sales this quarter as it reported an “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5042df8-52d4-4527-af1d-5ed70a96b0b5\">exceptional set of results</a>”, according to one analyst. Consumers emerging out of lockdown in China snapped up new iPhones and other Apple products. Carmaker <strong>Ford</strong> said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dc9dd10-70bc-4288-9216-52d13bcf3c49\">on Wednesday</a> it would make 1.1m fewer vehicles this year because of the chip shortages. This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475\">explainer</a> has more on the global semiconductor shortages.</p> <p>Hollywood talent agency-owner <strong>Endeavor</strong> raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85760a69-fa4f-42c6-a2ec-13feac70399c\">$1.9bn through its public listing</a> and a simultaneous private placement of its shares on Wednesday, valuing the company founded by Ari Emanuel at just over $10bn. Emanuel founded Endeavor in 1995 as a talent agency and the company has expanded and diversified through a number of acquisitions, buying rival William Morris Agency and sports agency IMG and adding the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the Miss Universe beauty pageant to its portfolio.</p> <p>US investment group <strong>Ares</strong> has raised €11bn for one of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a949bcbf-0081-405d-ad8e-4d438f2f9e88\">the world's largest private debt funds</a>, as lightly regulated alternative lenders step up their attempt to supplant traditional banks and bond markets in the wake of the pandemic.&#xa0;The fund, which will be Europe's largest of its type, will lend money directly to medium-sized companies in the region that want or need an alternative to the typically cheaper funding routes of bank loans and bond markets.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Alex Barker</strong> <br>In some ways Andrew Neil, who heads the new GB News venture, is merely bringing the spirit of Fleet Street to the small screen in a country that is home to the Sun and the Daily Mail. Where it is really going out on a limb is in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32078324-d4b5-44a9-b457-b3184c54b8bc\">its commercial model</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>New chief executive Laxman Narasimhan has put sustainable growth and responsible business <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eebfb848-5f2e-426d-a19c-ac99cdb1ca2b\">at the heart</a> of his vision for Reckitt Benckiser but Covid has delayed the moment when investors find out if it is working.<br><br><strong>Thanks for reading.
