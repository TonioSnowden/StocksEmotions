  "text": "<p><strong>Beats the traffic</strong></p> <p>I've only just plugged the Beats Fit Pros into my ears when a man at a café taps me on the shoulder, demanding to know where they're from. He says they look cool and unlike anything he's seen. That they can&#xa0;get famously frosty Londoners speaking to strangers should be the press release headline. His interest is understandable: these earbuds, a much-hyped release from the Apple-owned audio specialist Beats By Dre, have flexible silicone wingtips that curl upwards like a quotation mark in contrast to the downward stalks of AirPods and their countless facsimiles. And in addition to your standard white and black, they come in steely grey (my favourite) or a surprisingly appealing lavender. Could these handsome arrivistes disrupt the white-stemmed ubiquity of AirPods?&#xa0;</p> <p>They might well be Apple's most appealing earbuds to date. Although they come in a bigger-than-average case, they can do everything AirPods Pros can. And they're £40 cheaper, with better battery life. Their noise cancellation is just as good, and the sound quality is great, especially for music: they boast the meaty bass punch for which Beats is known. On a recent Friday-night commute home, when&#xa0;the Central line was a special kind of aural hell, I pressed play on a soulful Black Keys track with noise cancelling on and all din&#xa0;disappeared. (That said, if noise cancelling is top priority you should also check out the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort.)&#xa0;</p> <p>Fitted with the same H1 chip as AirPods, they respond to voice commands and possess spatial audio – a simulated cinematic surround sound that responds to the changing position of your head and distributes sound accordingly (for iOS users anyway: the earbuds work with both iOS and Android devices, but certain features are available only with iOS). You can also skip, pause, backtrack and control volume by pressing either earbud.</p> <p>They excel during workouts, being sweat-resistant, and fit more snugly than AirPods and most other offerings. They come with three bud sizes and the bendy wingtips are designed to nestle into an outer ridge of your ear. This clever design makes them feel highly secure while you're running and, although some might find it slightly uncomfortable after a while, it didn't bother me. In fact, I've gone and bought a pair myself.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/\"><em>Beats</em></a><em> Fit Pro, £199.99</em></p>  <p><strong>Make mine a skinny Brompton</strong></p> <p>For all their neatness, folding bikes have always been a bit… weighty. So Brompton, the London-based expert, has worked with a Sheffield factory to engineer its lightest creation to date – and one of the lightest models on the market. Made almost entirely from super-strength titanium, the dashing T&#xa0;Line One tips&#xa0;the scales at 7.45kg, and the T Line Urban, with its mudguards and gears, is 7.95kg (a big improvement on Brompton's 11.6kg A Line.) It's more speedy and agile to ride, yes, but the&#xa0;real benefit comes once you hop off and pick it up. Commuters who cycle part-way to work before lugging their wheels onto&#xa0;the train will be delighted. <a href=\"https://www.brompton.com/\"><em>Brompton</em></a><em> T&#xa0;Line&#xa0;One, £3,750; T&#xa0;Line Urban, £3,950</em></p>  <p><strong>Best for flat-out flat whites</strong></p> <p>On a recent early morning trip to the gym, I put Hydro Flask's sturdy new coffee tumbler through its paces. As&#xa0;I&#xa0;rushed for the bus, I was thankful for its no-spill lid with its slide-across opening (its predecessors had a permanently open sipping hole). It&#xa0;keeps coffee hot for up to six hours, or ice-cold for up to 24 hours and, mercifully, it's dishwasher-safe, a&#xa0;feature that's not as common as you&#xa0;might think. It's designed to prevent splashes but not leaks, so you&#xa0;wouldn't chuck it in a bag while full, but it's a reliable choice for delivering your caffeine hit on the run&#xa0;– and it comes in both 16fl oz size or – handier for flat whites – 12fl oz. <a href=\"https://www.hydroflask.com/uk-en/\"><em>Hydro Flask</em></a><em> All Around Tumbler 12oz, £22.95; 16oz, £26.95</em></p>  <p><strong>Leaders of the pack</strong></p> <p>CamelBak – the brand behind those terrifically nerdy hydration packs with&#xa0;plastic tubes – is now courting urbanites. It has released two backpacks geared towards cycling commuters: the 22-litre MULE and the&#xa0;30-litre HAWG (pictured). They're feather-light and water-resistant, with&#xa0;an additional “dry sleeve” for your&#xa0;laptop. After working with the University of Connecticut to limit the&#xa0;build-up of heat on your back, CamelBak developed an Air Support ventilation panel. The bags also have&#xa0;reflective surfaces to keep you&#xa0;visible. And lots of pockets – in&#xa0;all&#xa0;the right places.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.camelbak.co.uk/\"><em>Camelbak</em></a><em> MULE Commute&#xa0;22 Backpack, £120; HAWG&#xa0;Commute 30 Backpack, £150</em></p>  <p><strong>Pimp your Android Auto</strong></p> <p>The Motorola MA1 is a small black dongle that facilitates wireless Android Auto. Meaning: without you having to physically plug in your phone (it can stay snug in your jacket pocket), you can sync it and all its apps with your car's dashboard and entertainment system. There are a couple of caveats: you must have Android Auto set up in&#xa0;your car; and your phone must be&#xa0;on Android 11 or higher. Then just slot the&#xa0;dongle into a USB port and pair it&#xa0;with your phone; it connects using 5GHz Wi-Fi. Although there are&#xa0;competitors, few are as speedy and&#xa0;reliable as the MA1, which is the first to&#xa0;be certified by Google. It's available in the US now and in the UK&#xa0;later this spring.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://motorolasound.com/audio-products/android-auto/ma1\"><em>Motorola</em></a><em> MA1, £89.95</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jamie_waters\"><em>@jamie_waters</em></a></p><p>Source: Jamie Waters 2022 'Top tech for the trip to work – and back again' FT.com 28 February.
