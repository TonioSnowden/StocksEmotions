  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 537 points, or 1.7%, to 30,482.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 70 points, or 1.8%, at 3,829.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP declined 184 points, or 1.6%, to 11,350.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The next Federal Open Market Committee decision is looming over the market, as investors grapple not just with whether the central bank will make a 75 basis point rate increase or lift rates by 100 points, but also how high the Fed will signal rates will go in the future. The meeting starts Tuesday and ends Wednesday.</p><p>Monday's market action was without conviction, where stocks opened lower yet closed higher on the least volume since Aug. 29. But markets erased all their modest gains from the prior session — and then some — as rising Treasury yields helped steamroll stocks.</p><p>See: Why rising Treasury yields are plaguing the stock market ahead of Fed's next rate increase</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury yields, which move opposite to price, continued to march higher, with the rate on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y jumping 6.5 basis points to 3.540% after ending Monday at its highest since 2011. The yield on the 2-year note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y continued to press toward the 4% threshold. Rising yields can weigh on stocks, making government bonds appear more attractive relative to riskier assets like equities.</p><p>See: Why rising Treasury yields are a drag on the stock market</p><p>Of course, the Fed isn't the only major central bank hiking interest rates to fight stubbornly high inflation. Sweden's Riksbank on Tuesday opted for a 100 basis point hike, and analysts expect at least a half-point rise when the Bank of England meets Thursday.</p><p>All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading in the red on Tuesday, with real estate, materials and consumer discretionary shares seeing the biggest losses. As a result, the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF XRT, Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund UK:XLBP and iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF IYR were all sharply lower.</p><p>Need to Know: There's only one 'perfect asset' to fight all the bad news that could be coming, says this strategist</p><p>Data showed U.S. housing starts rose 12.2% in August after a revised 10.9% fall in July, while building permits dropped 10% in August.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Ford Motor Co. F late Monday said inflation and parts shortages will leave it with more unfinished vehicles than expected and that payments to suppliers will be about $1 billion more than expected. Ford did nonetheless reiterate its full-year operating profit outlook. Shares fell more than 11%.</p><p>* Apple Inc. AAPL announcedprice rises for the app store in a number of Asian and European countries, likely a response to the surge in the U.S. dollar DXY. Shares were up 0.7%. Apple and Boeing Company BAwere the only two Dow stocks clinging to gains Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>* Nordstrom Inc. JWN shares fell 1.9% after the department store chain said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a \"poison pill,\" that is effective immediately and lasts for one year.</p><p>— Steve Goldstein contributed reporting</p><p>Dow down nearly 550 points as Fed decision looms over market; Treasury yields jump</p>",
