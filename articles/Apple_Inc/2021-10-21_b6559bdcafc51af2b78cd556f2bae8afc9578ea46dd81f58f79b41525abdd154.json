  "title": "Snap Blames Apple's Privacy Changes for Hurting Its Ad Business; Social-media company posted revenue and user growth in latest quarter but expects growth to slow",
  "text": "<p>The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company said Thursday that it projects revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31 to range between $1.17 billion and $1.21 billion, which would be up from $911 million in the like period a year ago but below the $1.36 billion that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting.</p><p>\"While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our ad partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS,\" Snap said.</p><p>Shares were down 27% in after-hours trading.</p><p>To resolve the problem, Snap said it is developing additional first-party tools to help its ad partners achieve their goals.</p><p>The company also attributed its holiday-quarter outlook to supply-chain and labor-market shortages, saying those problems are indirectly crimping its ad business by hurting business for its ad partners.</p><p>\"This in turn reduces their short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply-constrained,\" Snap said.</p><p>Snap, whose Snapchat app is popular with teens and young adults, has stood out from its larger peers throughout the pandemic by posting steady revenue and user growth. It has launched new features to appeal to businesses in more ways than just advertising. For example, one called My Places offers users personalized recommendations of places to eat and visit based on their friends' interests.</p><p>During the quarter, Snap said Spotlight, a video-sharing tool it introduced last year to appeal to content creators, received twice as many submissions compared with the second quarter.</p><p>For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Snap said revenue rose to $1.1 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations. Daily users climbed 23% to 306 million.</p><p>Snap also said it narrowed its loss to $72 million, down from $200 million in the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of $156 million.</p><p>Earlier this week, Snap announced that users with Pixel 6 phones from Alphabet Inc.'s Google will be able to access Snapchat from their lock screen. That means they can more quickly open the app by double-tapping it. Snap also said it is working with Google to build unique augmented-reality experiences.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
