  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Gear & Gadgets -- That's Debatable: Can Apple's Screen Time App Help Curb Your Phone Addiction? --- Since launching in 2018, the app's weekly reports have proven divisive",
  "text": "<p>Screen Time can also reaffirm people who feel content with their phone usage. Bethany Nagid, 32, of Portland, Ore., works in operations at a software company. She deleted her own social networks years ago with one exception: an Instagram account for Holly, her pit bull.</p><p>The report provides a weekly check-in that actually makes Ms. Nagid feel good. \"It is confirmation that I'm doing a decent job with my goal of distancing from social media.\"</p><p>NO: A common complaint about the weekly Screen Time report is that checking it inspires little but anxiety. Breetel Graves, 34, a support engineer in Canaan, Conn., with two children, says social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram offer what she sees as necessary downtime in her chaotic life. The amount of time she spends \"zoning out\" with diverting posts already provokes guilt, she said, and getting a weekly report via an invasive push notification only makes her feel lousier. \"I spend enough time shame-spiraling about it all on my own,\" she said.</p><p>If you do want to reduce your app usage, some experts argue that the report ill-equips you. \"Seeing some weekly data dump of contextless data won't help you use technology more intentionally,\" said Chris Bailey, author of \"Hyperfocus\" and the upcoming \"How to Calm Your Mind\" (Penguin Life Books, 2022). Screen Time, he said, would be much more helpful if it collated its findings with other information gathered by your phone. For example, assuming you track your sleep with your iPhone or Apple Watch, Screen Time could tell you if you distract yourself more on days when you are sleep-deprived.</p><p>Additional features might have helped Anna Burgess Yang, 39, a consultant in Chicago. After studying her reports, she tried using the software to set limits for apps she wanted to use less. The experiment soon short-circuited. \"Ultimately, it was too easy and too tempting to override the Screen Time limits . . . it didn't curb my screen time usage at all.\"</p>",
