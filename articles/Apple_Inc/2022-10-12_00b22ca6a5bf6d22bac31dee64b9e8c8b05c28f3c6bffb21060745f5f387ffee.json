  "text": "<p>The approval means Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the company set up by Donald Trump following his presidency, can now distribute its platform through Google's app store, the largest for mobile devices using Google's Android operating system.</p><p>\"It's been a pleasure to work with Google, and we're glad they helped us to finally bring Truth Social to all Americans, regardless of what device they use,\" said Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Chief Executive Devin Nunes in a statement. \"Today marks a significant milestone in our mission to restore free speech online.\"</p><p>The approval removes a stumbling block for Truth Social, which bills itself as America's \"Big Tent\" social-media platform, as its parent company attempts to complete a deal with a special-purpose acquisition company and become publicly listed.</p><p>The SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp., on Monday delayed a vote on extending the deadline for shareholders to approve the merger. Shares of Digital World Acquisition rose 5.8% in after-hours trading Wednesday.</p><p>Truth Social has been available through Apple Inc.'s mobile App Store since February, when it surged to the top of the rankings for free apps. The app recently received approval for the Samsung Galaxy.</p><p>Mr. Trump has used Truth Social as a megaphone since Twitter Inc. banned him from its platform in January 2021, citing \"the risk of further incitement of violence\" following the attack on the U.S. Capitol. He has said he has no plans to return to Twitter and is focusing on Truth Social instead.</p><p>Google restored the conservative social-media app Parler to the Play Store last month after it agreed to change some of its content-moderation policies.</p><p>\"Apps may be distributed on Google Play provided they comply with our developer guidelines, including the requirement to effectively moderate user-generated content and remove objectionable posts such as those that incite violence,\" a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><p>Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Google Approves Trump-Backed Truth Social for Its App Store</p>",
