  "text": "<p>Mr. Herron's new novel \"Slough House,\" published this week, follows a group of disgraced British spies who are being picked off after MI5 launches a retaliatory hit on Russian soil in response to the Skripal poisonings, which took place in Salisbury, England. The title is named after the decrepit London headquarters of the discredited agents, or Slow Horses, as they are known.</p><p>The new novel is the seventh book in an award-winning series from Mr. Herron, 57. The first two novels in the series, \"Slow Horses\" and \"Dead Lions,\" are being adapted as two consecutive six-part shows for Apple TV+ starring Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p><p>Mr. Herron spoke to the Journal about his latest novel, being compared to John le Carre, and his love of screwball comedies. Edited from an interview:</p><p>WSJ: The spies of Slough House are all deeply flawed individuals who have been sidelined by MI5. What originally gave you this idea?</p><p>A: One of the key drivers was my feeling that it would be more interesting to write about failure than about success. If I was writing about failure and people who were disallowed access to the ways that the secret service operate, I didn't have to worry about things like technology and the correct procedures, protocols and laws that the secret service follow and abide by.</p><p>WSJ: The dialogue between the Slow Horses is rapid-fire and wisecracking. Did it take you a while to develop this tone of voice?</p><p>A: The first drafts of many of these dialogue-heavy scenes go on for pages and pages, and I have to strip out all the bits that don't work. When I was much younger, I devoured screwball comedies like the William Powell and Myrna Loy \"Thin Man\" movies. My idea of what makes for a good dialogue scene is probably born from having watched those movies years ago.</p><p>WSJ: Gary Oldman described you as the heir to John le Carre. Do you feel like you're following in le Carre's tradition?</p><p>A: It was a lovely thing for Mr. Oldman to say. I'm always very happy to be compared to le Carre, but I don't personally feel that I'm stepping into his shoes or anything like that. Those shoes are far too large for me.</p><p>WSJ: Have you had any feedback from members or ex-members of the secret services about your novels?</p><p>A: Someone who had worked for MI5 approached me after I'd done a reading and said that he thought my portrayal of the secret service was very realistic, which is pretty frightening when you think about it.</p><p>WSJ: London becomes almost a character in your novels. Is that how you see it?</p><p>A: I personalize the city a lot when I write. I invest it with all sorts of moods so I'm sort of inventing it, as much as reflecting it. I'll either have the characters out at night and thinking dark thoughts, or ever so occasionally they'll be out in the sunlight and feeling a bit more optimistic.</p><p>WSJ: In your new novel, Brexit has altered the spying landscape for Britain \"ruling out any more courtesy access to European neighbors.\" Did you hear about any disgruntlement regarding Brexit on the intelligence grapevine?</p><p>A: No, not at all, I made that up because it suited the mood of what I was writing about. But I would not be remotely surprised if that was the actual case.</p><p>WSJ: You write about \"software replacing human agency as the cornerstone of intelligence.\" Do you think this development can make things less interesting for you as a writer?</p><p>A: It's one of the things that I'm avoiding and I'm not sure it's something I was conscious of in 2008 when I started writing these books. Now, I think that most espionage is about covert surveillance. It's about listening in to mobile telephones, which I have no interest in writing about and no knowledge of how it is done. There might be those who could make a good fiction out of that, but I couldn't.</p>",
