  "text": "<p>Like Apple and Amazon, Kanye West (or Ye, as he is now known) wants to build an ecosystem of branded products. In this Ye-verse, presided over by US President Ye, we will live in dwellings designed by his architecture company Yeezy Home while wearing Yeezy apparel. Worship will be undertaken with his Sunday Service pop-up church project. News will take the form of West's social media meltdowns, erratically typed IN CAPITAL LETTERS. And entertainment will be provided by his Stem Player audio device, loaded with his latest awful music.</p> <p>Which brings us to <em>Donda 2</em>. The sequel to last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/022b8d1e-5f1f-4116-a390-838ee606303f\"><em>Donda</em> </a>has only been made available on the Stem Player, a £200 gadget with an interesting but basic music-mixing capacity. Within the Ye-verse, this costly act of bundling is intended, in Kanye's words, “to free music” from the “oppressive system” of rent-seeking record labels and streaming platforms. In the real world, however, it has resulted in a chaotic album rollout and mass piracy, with streams popping up on the internet for all to listen to — not quite the act of liberation West seems to have intended.</p> <p>What of the album itself? Its predecessor was spectacularly bad. Almost two hours long and named after his mother Donda West, who died in 2007, <em>Donda</em> tried in its capacious and confused way to fuse two great traditions of African-American culture: gospel music and hip-hop. <em>Donda 2</em> is less ambitious and so has less far to fall. In that respect, it might be considered a marginal improvement.</p> <p>It partly resembles a flatter, less audacious version of his 2008 break-up album <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>. This time the break-up is with his wife Kim Kardashian, who filed for divorce last year. “When I think about it, my eyes fill up with water,” he raps woodenly in “True Love”, accompanied by a sad hook crooned by rapper XXXTentacion, who was murdered in 2018. The song has a plangent atmosphere but dull dynamics, maundering about as though splashing through puddles. The quality of West's introspection scarcely exceeds that of a crying emoji.</p> <p>Feelings are directed as much towards things as people in the Ye-verse. In “Louie Bags”, he sings about stopping buying Louis Vuitton bags after the death of his friend, the fashion house's artistic director Virgil Abloh. A dreary electronic drone underlines the paucity of the sentiment. In snoozy ballad “Broken Road”, the billionaire declares himself to be free “like a homeless person”. Travis Scott, whose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3929bed2-cc0b-42c0-b93c-6eb3c7b19c96\">Astroworld Festival</a> in November ended in 10 deaths from a crowd crush, turns up on “Pablo” chanting: “Let's have some fun.”</p> <p>In this empathy-voided milieu, the most aggressive songs are the best. “Security” is a gated-community fantasy of a showdown with a security detail set to an impressively ominous beat. Elsewhere, Atlanta rapper Future, the album's executive producer, has several sinuously menacing guest spots. Such bright spots, if they can be called that, are scant. Repetitious and lacklustre, <em>Donda 2</em> discloses serious deficiencies in the Ye-verse. Curiosity might impel a visit — but you really wouldn't want to live there.</p> <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p><em>‘Donda 2' is&#xa0;self-released</em></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2022 'Kanye West disappoints (again) with Donda 2' FT.com 2 March.
