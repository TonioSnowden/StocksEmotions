  "text": "<p>   Ms. Lucchese was gaining a reputation internally as outspoken and blunt, many current and former employees said. Some former staffers said they considered her use of the F-word at the 2017 meeting unseemly because staff were still reeling from the company's firing of some digital executives in charge of the website overhaul. \"We had just lost some colleagues,\" said Nancy Cross Shimmel, a former Scholastic website editor who was there. \"It was so inappropriate and disrespectful.\" Ms. Sparkman said Ms. Lucchese declined to comment on the meeting. </p><p>   In 2018, Mr. Robinson promoted Ms. Lucchese to president of entertainment. She sought to create shows using Scholastic's intellectual property, including the \"Puppy Place\" series on Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+. </p><p>   Tensions flared from time to time between her and Mr. Robinson over their approach to innovation, former executives said. Ms. Lucchese supported the concept of a monthly book-box subscription Scholastic was considering that would mail a selection of titles directly to families, former staffers said. Mr. Robinson demurred, saying it would be costly to move goods outside Scholastic's distribution network of schools. Scholastic never launched the initiative. </p><p>   Ms. Lucchese and Mr. Robinson appeared to break up for good in 2019, the Journal reported last year. </p><p>   Scholastic didn't complete a business-wide digital-transformation plan launched in 2017 and called \"Scholastic 2020,\" of which Ms. Lucchese was a leader, people familiar with the initiative said. The company still can't easily assess the sales performance of a title across divisions that have long kept their own data, these people said. It is also difficult to track a single consumer across divisions. Ms. Sparkman said the company followed through on some Scholastic 2020 projects, including technology upgrades and cost-cutting measures, that helped position it well during the pandemic. </p><p>   Since Mr. Robinson's death, Ms. Lucchese in executive meetings has outlined a vision for a different Scholastic -- more focused on families and teachers as end consumers and not tied only to school infrastructure, people familiar with the discussions said. In November, the company named board member Mary Beech as chief marketing and transformation officer, largely to aid direct-to-consumer efforts. </p><p>   Ms. Lucchese has supported a digital plan, \"One Scholastic,\" that would once again seek to knit together its divisions -- such as education, book clubs, international, trade publishing, and book fairs -- across marketing, data analytics and digital offerings. A longtime board member called the divisions \"feudal kingdoms,\" saying Ms. Lucchese has been effective over the years -- and since Mr. Robinson's death -- at forging relationships that could help enable companywide change. </p><p>   \"She was a very good strategist, and I think she gained because of the romantic relationship,\" said Linda Lee, a former vice president who worked at the company from 1997 to 2019 and now does freelance consulting. \"Even after the romance was over, Dick still trusted her, and that was because she really was someone who came along that had a good vision for the company.\" </p><p></p>",
