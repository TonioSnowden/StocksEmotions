  "text": "<p>Amazon has told the social network Parler, an increasingly popular forum for the far-right, that its web hosting would be suspended on Sunday, a move that all but ensures it is taken offline.</p> <p>The action is the latest attempt by a tech company to quash incitement to violence in the wake of Wednesday's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/929a4193-bf46-4786-be08-373d134388ec\">rampage</a> in Washington by a pro-Trump mob. Apple and Google expelled Parler from their respective app stores in the past 24 hours, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d44a5127-ce1e-407c-bce2-293be771cd1f\">Twitter</a> permanently suspended President Donald Trump's account on Friday.</p> <p>Unless Parler can find an alternative hosting company willing to take its business, the site will no longer be able to function after 11:59pm Pacific time on Sunday.</p> <p>The actions against Mr Trump and Parler have heightened debate on the powers of technology companies, as critics accuse them of seeking to regulate speech online and censoring conservative voices. </p> <p>Parler had become a popular alternative to Twitter for conservatives angered by what they saw as the larger social media company's liberal bias. But critics say far-right activists have used the platform to incite violence, including calls to assassinate vice-president Mike Pence.</p> <p>The trust and safety team at Amazon's cloud division, AWS, wrote in a letter to Parler's chief policy officer Amy Peikoff that while it provided technology to those with political views across the spectrum it had been “troubled by repeated violations” of its terms of service concerning moderation.</p> <p>“We cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” read the letter, first obtained by BuzzFeed News and verified by the Financial Times.</p> <p>The letter said that AWS had been in touch with the controversial forum for “several weeks”, bringing to its attention 98 instances of posts that “clearly encourage and incite violence”.</p> <p>Amazon did not offer further comment.&#xa0;</p> <p>In removing Parler, Apple explained that it respected diverse points of view but that there was no place “on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity”.</p> <p>Parler, a self-described “unbiased social media network” that purports to champion “free speech”, topped the downloads chart on Apple's App Store after Twitter banned President Trump's personal account on Friday. </p> <p>In response, the outgoing president released a statement saying he had been “negotiating with various other sites” and had looked at the possibility “of building out our own platform in the near future”.</p> <p>Parler's chief executive John Matze posted on the site that the company would rebuild “from scratch” and find a new host. He said the site would be offline for “up to a week”.</p> <p>He suggested the moves were a “co-ordinated attack by the tech giants to kill competition in the marketplace”.</p> <p>Dina Srinivasan, an antitrust scholar whose work has been instrumental in calls to break up Facebook, said it was a “cop out” for Parler to bring up collusion.</p> <p>“To suggest that Amazon, Google, and Apple co-ordinated an attack to silence Parler and Trump is ridiculous,” she said. “It's totally rational for any firm to act in the identical manner.”</p> <p>The tech giants' moves suggest that any new platform would have a challenging time to break into the mainstream.</p> <p>“American companies don't want to be complicit with an insurrection,” Ms Srinivasan said.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d877d047-1f79-4365-91b8-4a7c1d82f2ef\"><em>Action against Parler is not a victory to celebrate / From Ayden Férdeline, Public Interest Technologist, Berlin, Germany</em></a></p><p>Source: Dave Lee, Patrick McGee and Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 2021 'Tech companies kick Twitter rival Parler off their platforms' FT.com 10 January.
