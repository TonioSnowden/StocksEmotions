  "text": "<p>Midday on a late-January Sunday. Across the city, church bells are&#xa0;pealing, cascades of sound colliding above the rooftops. I&#xa0;barely&#xa0;hear them, because the windows are shut&#xa0;tight against the&#xa0;numbing cold,&#xa0;and because familiarity breeds indifference, sometimes even to the sublime. Pandemic aside&#xa0;(how glib, and awful, that once-unimaginable phrase), it's been a rough winter in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8e010d9-3b22-4bfa-b43e-7e7d0cd1e548\">Italy</a>. Gelid rains&#xa0;have pummelled the country, turning rivers into&#xa0;dun-coloured torrents that submerge banks and flood monuments on their frictionless route to the Mediterranean. Occasionally I&#xa0;stand on the Ponte Fabricio&#xa0;and stare down at&#xa0;the Tiber, watching the water roil and plait. It's mesmerising. It's also&#xa0;weirdly envy-inducing. The&#xa0;Tiber, at least, is going somewhere. I,&#xa0;like&#xa0;you, am very&#xa0;much not.</p> <p>There are admittedly far worse places to be grounded. But even one that is picturesqueness itself tends to lose its&#xa0;lustre when it's a freeze-frame. Since last June, I&#xa0;have boarded a plane exactly once, to London. I've no real idea when I'll be en route to anywhere properly far away again.</p> <p>So, like millions of people, I've taken to escaping this&#xa0;picture by delving into the 9,958 others that live on my&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c89225f6-a3b2-40f4-8c7b-630666cdc24f\">iPhone</a>. Not something I was in the habit of doing prior&#xa0;to&#xa0;this lockdown: photo dives were precision strikes&#xa0;for jogging my recall while writing – I went in, I&#xa0;checked a&#xa0;visual reference, I was out. But a few weeks ago I started peregrinating aimlessly along the arc of almost nine years' worth of images. It's the only wandering I'm doing. It's what has to pass for&#xa0;travel, in&#xa0;these solitary, claustrophobic days.</p> <p>In the Argentine wetlands of Iberá (October 2018), I&#xa0;thrill again, albeit more faintly than the first time, to a kind of exotic I barely remember. My videos pan across a&#xa0;shocking-green plain, bristling with palms and <em>ceiba</em> trees whose outer-space blooms are fat and succulent as fruit, crowded with docile capybaras grazing in clusters – guinea pigs the size of Labradors, preposterous and adorable. A&#xa0;week later, I discover that I still possess entire grids full of the grass hills and steppes of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f802c8c-3e3d-4302-9282-cd03bacc5bd1\">Mongolia</a> (May 2018), rolling away as far as the eye can track them, lit by neon-azure dawns and tea-rose dusks with which I&#xa0;was clearly slightly obsessed. Portraits, too, of the nomadic herders I was shadowing: dashing horsemen and&#xa0;capering children, their obsidian hair framing flinty grins and cheeks&#xa0;lit with tiny bonfires of pink.</p> <p>One thing I realised quickly: a blend of longing and satisfaction is the ideal, but the balance is crucial. Two times now I have retreated to Luang Prabang (September 2019; January 2020) and my many close-ups of painted door frames and gilded serpentine temple finials,&#xa0;dust motes sparkling in sleepy guesthouses, Mekong&#xa0;longtail boats with prows like blades. They are a compendium of&#xa0;dizzying detail and colour that is the perfect antidote to&#xa0;my mercilessly unchanging view of&#xa0;wet&#xa0;<em>cotto </em>roofs and&#xa0;low quicksilver sky. Images of the Christmases I've spent in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03f1393-e0ba-4dbf-83f2-5c56e5246d9e\">Sydney</a>, on the other hand, prove to be too much&#xa0;summertime gorgeousness in this literal winter of lockdown&#xa0;discontent – an exercise in masochism, like rereading texts from an old flame you still&#xa0;pine for who's off&#xa0;living his best life half a world away.</p> <p>Thumbing randomly through summer 2014, the multi-hued blur coheres into a streak of uniform, diffuse beige – the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0795918-7f7d-11e8-8e67-1e1a0846c475\">Skeleton Coast</a>, in northwest Namibia, where the desert cedes to the Atlantic Ocean. The air spins with opalescence; it was sharp with salt, though I was at least five&#xa0;miles inland. I stare into my palm, willing even just shadows of sensations back. Sudden coolness on my bare&#xa0;arms; desert silence, which is its own presence, in my&#xa0;ears; salt on my lips. You could taste it. <em>I</em> had tasted it,&#xa0;I&#xa0;remind myself, as I sped across a landscape that looked&#xa0;like Mars;&#xa0;and is now, years&#xa0;later and 4,500 miles away, as&#xa0;unfathomably distant.</p> <p>Another lesson this ritual has bestowed: you know a place is a true&#xa0;place of your heart when pictures of it evince a spontaneous, full-body, five-senses recollection. Namibia, spectacular and haunting as it was, isn't one. Nikoi, a minuscule island in western Indonesia (September 2015), is.&#xa0;Its&#xa0;“villas” are thatch and reclaimed driftwood. The beach shape-shifts extraordinarily with the&#xa0;seasons; in my&#xa0;photos, it's arching northward, an inverted comma cupping a shallow lagoon. Here&#xa0;is&#xa0;my four-poster bed; here a path bowered in rainforest; here seashells I&#xa0;gathered, arranged in&#xa0;a bowl. They all animate almost effortlessly in my mind.&#xa0;The white netting that canopied my&#xa0;bed had dipped&#xa0;and spiralled in the constant offshore breeze like&#xa0;a&#xa0;living thing. An entire, blissful afternoon unspools from&#xa0;that&#xa0;lone image of seashells: wavelets in the&#xa0;lagoon plishing against my calves,&#xa0;the pleasant crick in my neck from searching the shallows, the&#xa0;damp sandy&#xa0;heft of them clutched in a fold of&#xa0;my sarong. The rainforest emanated a machine whine of insects, a constant single note&#xa0;that rings with total clarity in&#xa0;my memory. It evokes in turn the heavy equatorial air, traces of diesel smoke and&#xa0;tuberose and vegetal decay floating in&#xa0;it&#xa0;– the&#xa0;atmosphere I moved through once, in another life I'd had in southeast Asia.</p> <p>Which is, in truth, what I am revisiting. Not just a&#xa0;holiday, or a landscape: my life. Because – fair warning&#xa0;–&#xa0;that is where a scroll back into all those tiny captures might take you, whether you're down for the&#xa0;ride&#xa0;or not.&#xa0;Our pasts are infinitely more complex than&#xa0;photos of&#xa0;them can ever be, and nowhere near as&#xa0;given to neat&#xa0;curation. If we look at all closely – if, when we journey backward in our phones, we really go&#xa0;there – we&#xa0;can't <em>not </em>see who, and how, we were then,&#xa0;along with&#xa0;where we were.</p> <p>April 2013: a desert camp deep in southern <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05809d3a-ee64-425e-b72e-83ffba1262e6\">Morocco</a>. A&#xa0;picture of a lone table atop a&#xa0;dune that has been sculpted into a plateau by an overnight wind. Dressed in&#xa0;sky-blue linen, set&#xa0;for one, with painted ceramics and antique silver. All&#xa0;around it, an absolute distillation of emptiness.</p> <p>The image is perfect. <em>You need to save that for your book&#xa0;jacket</em>, wrote a friend to whom I later emailed it.&#xa0;And&#xa0;it's true that this is, through a very specific lens, a&#xa0;picture of&#xa0;what my life looked like in that moment.</p> <p>What I was also living in that moment, however, was&#xa0;something I had for months been doing a great deal&#xa0;of&#xa0;emotional gymnastics to avoid – something that,&#xa0;in&#xa0;the pitiless volume of that landscape, it became impossible for me not to reckon with: the acknowledgement, final and total, that I was probably never&#xa0;going to have a child.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's what I remember when I look at this&#xa0;picture: that when I took it, two seams of&#xa0;thought were ribboning around&#xa0;and across each other in my mind. One was: how stunning the Sahara, how chic the&#xa0;mise-en-scène, how&#xa0;singular the moment. How lucky&#xa0;I&#xa0;am. The other was that the one abiding narrative of&#xa0;my&#xa0;life, whose inevitability I'd taken as an article of faith&#xa0;since&#xa0;I was a girl playing with dolls, was almost certainly&#xa0;not ever going to come to pass. I&#xa0;sat at that gorgeous table,&#xa0;admiring the view; I was also contemplating&#xa0;this small, new&#xa0;crater at my centre. While&#xa0;I&#xa0;poured coffee as the&#xa0;sun tracked higher in the sky, I was&#xa0;trying to imagine how the kinesis of motherhood&#xa0;deferred&#xa0;works: how I would ever manage to redirect all&#xa0;that expectation and energy and inchoate love and patience and&#xa0;creativity and connection – left, now, with no clear place to go.</p> <p>I'd not bargained on a pretty picture of a table in Morocco occasioning such a visceral trip down memory lane. I probably should have. Because such is the discursive nature of memory. And, it turns out, of random scrolling on your iPhone, where memory will defy&#xa0;the containment of your best framing efforts, and speak from far beyond the edges of pixels.</p> <p>What's edifying in all this is that those pasts were&#xa0;once the present. Meaning that what you thumb forward to and click on after that was once your future. Eventually, travelling in your phone, a context for your life obtains. Which is also what happens when we travel&#xa0;this great, wide, unpredictable world – but again, only&#xa0;if we're inclined to really look.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, I noticed the date and realised that it was exactly a year ago that I moved to Italy. 24&#xa0;January 2020: a view out the window of a flat in Trastevere. An enfilade of façades –&#xa0;apricot, peppermint pink, yellow – moves in&#xa0;diagonal toward the rise of the Janiculum hill. Calabrian pines unfold along it. An&#xa0;abundance of&#xa0;sunlight spills down on everything like a&#xa0;benediction, of&#xa0;the kind that&#xa0;living here makes you learn&#xa0;to expect.&#xa0;</p> <p>I posted this photograph to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mariashollenbarger/?hl=en\">my Instagram feed</a> a few days&#xa0;later. “View from the new chapter not at all bad,” reads the&#xa0;caption. A bit smug. Clearly I could have had no idea then that this same chapter would also forever include the interval of these short-but-so-long, colourless days. But had I not kept venturing back into my phone to remind myself that colourless days eventually end, I'd perhaps not have been reminded of just how fortuitously a chapter can start; and that there is something hopeful, and inviolable, in having no idea where it – and I – might go next.</p><p>Source: Maria Shollenbarger 2021 'Travels in my iPhone' FT.com 5 March.
