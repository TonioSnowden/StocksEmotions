  "text": "<p>   Suppliers to Apple Inc. are among the businesses taking precedence in local governments' efforts to restart factories in the Shanghai region as the U.S. tech giant, facing supply constraints, warned that the pandemic's resurgence in China could dent sales. </p><p>   Covid-19 outbreaks have hit Shanghai and the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang over the last month -- a region with one of the highest concentrations of Apple's top suppliers, according to the company's supplier list released last year. </p><p>   In Shanghai, 31 companies run production facilities that supply to Apple, while there are 79 in Jiangsu and seven in Zhejiang, the list shows. </p><p>   As Shanghai locked down and nearby regions imposed stringent Covid-prevention measures, many suppliers halted production, with some shutdowns lasting weeks. </p><p>   As economic pains grow from the policies, China has been pushing to resume factory operations in an effort that has so far been gradual and, at times, bumpy. In Kunshan, a city in Jiangsu about 30 miles west of Shanghai, the local government released a list last week that designated several major Apple suppliers, including Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Wistron Corp., as \"Covid-free\" enterprises, granting them priority to resume production. </p><p>   China's central government has vowed to help restart factories, including Taiwan-based manufacturers. \"We will continue to work with relevant authorities to actively assist Taiwanese companies to overcome the impact caused by the pandemic and help them resume production and operation as soon as possible,\" said Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday. Many Apple suppliers are based in Taiwan. </p><p>   The impact of regional disruptions on Apple depends on how quickly and widely its suppliers can resume operations. The company warned Thursday that supply constraints stemming partly from pandemic disruptions would hurt revenue by as much as $8 billion in the current quarter. Apple didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday that Apple's constraints were mainly centered on the Shanghai corridor. The company's estimate for as much as $8 billion in affected sales reflects the various ramp-ups necessary to get production back up and running, he said. </p><p>   \"On a positive front, almost all of the affected final-assembly factories have now restarted,\" Mr. Cook said. </p><p>   Apple's supply-chain constraints had improved during the first three months of the year, Mr. Cook said. Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates the effect during the period hurt revenue by $1 billion to $2 billion, compared with $6 billion to $7 billion during the holiday-shopping period in the final three months of 2021. </p><p>   Because of the uncertainties, Apple didn't give revenue guidance for the current quarter ending in June, though some analysts are interpreting the company's comments to indicate that sales would be flat from a year ago's $81 billion. Before Thursday, analysts on average were predicting revenue to rise 6% to $86.4 billion, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Some Apple suppliers have restarted factories in recent days in bubblelike environments where workers are kept inside factory premises or nearby and tested frequently for Covid. The model has become increasingly popular in China to continue manufacturing amid outbreaks. </p><p></p>",
