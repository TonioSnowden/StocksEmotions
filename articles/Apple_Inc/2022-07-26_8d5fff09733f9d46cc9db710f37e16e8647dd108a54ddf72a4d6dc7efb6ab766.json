  "text": "<p>Shares in US retailers led Wall Street lower on Tuesday after Walmart warned that higher inflation would hurt its profits. </p> <p>The broad S&amp;P 500 share index shed 1.2 per cent, with consumer cyclical stocks suffering the sharpest declines. </p> <p>Walmart's stock dropped 7.6 per cent after the big-box retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/664f16d0-2faf-4b7b-af72-236e370dbd08\">issued its second profit warning</a> in 10 weeks. In an update after Monday's closing bell, it said rising prices for fuel and food were weighing on demand for less essential items such as clothing. </p> <p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.9 per cent. Recession fears and jitters ahead of earnings updates from some of the world's largest technology companies combined to darken the market mood. </p> <p>Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet will post quarterly earnings after the US close on Tuesday, with Amazon and Apple updating on Thursday. </p> <p>“It's hard to see how sentiment towards the US market as a whole could withstand meaningful disappointment from these tech names,” said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors. </p> <p>In Europe, the euro weakened against the dollar and government bonds rallied after Russia moved on Monday to further cut gas supplies to the EU and the IMF slashed its global growth forecasts. </p> <p>The common currency dropped 1 per cent to $1.012, having fallen to parity with the US dollar earlier this month, as energy security concerns related to the war in Ukraine heightened anxiety about a recession in the region. </p> <p>“Geopolitical developments in Ukraine have exacerbated the inflationary dynamic,” said Candice Bangsund, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Fiera Capital.</p> <p>“The eurozone economy looks particularly vulnerable, given its dependence on Russian energy,” she added. “So the outlook for the eurozone has deteriorated alongside those soaring natural gas prices.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8450175-7332-4074-aaac-71534141e305\">Futures linked to TTF</a>, Europe's wholesale gas price, jumped about 14 per cent to above €200 per megawatt hour, more than double their level of early June. This came after Russian state exporter Gazprom said it would cut existing flows on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just 20 per cent of capacity from Wednesday. </p> <p>Germany's 10-year Bund yield, the benchmark for eurozone borrowing costs, fell 0.09 percentage points to 0.87 per cent, according to Tradeweb data. Bond yields fall as prices rise.</p> <p>The IMF said fallout from the war contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67ce86b5-163d-4204-a973-ab1528af473c\">downgrade in its expectations</a> for global growth in gross domestic product to 3.2 per cent in 2022, down 0.4 percentage points from its April estimate and roughly half the pace of last year's expansion.</p> <p>The Conference Board's US consumer index also fell to a reading of 95.7 in July. It was its third straight month of decline. The decrease was driven primarily by a drop in the present situation index, which the Conference Board said was a sign that growth had slowed in the third quarter. </p> <p>Investors are also waiting for a verdict from the US Federal Reserve, which began its latest two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Most analysts expect the central bank to respond to surging inflation by raising its funds rate by 0.75 percentage points to a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>The 10-year US Treasury yield slipped 0.02 percentage points to 2.80 per cent. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2022 'US retail stocks lead Wall Street lower after Walmart warns on profits' FT.com 26 July.
