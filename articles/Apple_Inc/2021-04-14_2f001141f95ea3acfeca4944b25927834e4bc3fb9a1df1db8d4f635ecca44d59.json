  "title": "Epic Games Valued at $29 Billion --- Creator of 'Fortnite' completes new round of funding as it heads into trial against Apple",
  "text": "<p>\"We are grateful to our new and existing investors who support our vision for Epic and the Metaverse,\" Mr. Sweeney said in a written statement, referring to the concept of a collective virtual shared space.</p><p>Epic was founded in 1991. In addition to the shooter game \"Fortnite,\" it makes the Unreal Engine, a suite of software tools for developing videogames and producing special effects for television shows, movies and other types of digital content. It also owns the video-chat app Houseparty and the studios behind hit games such as \"Rocket League\" and \"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout.\"</p><p>Released in 2017, \"Fortnite\" quickly became a global cultural phenomenon, especially beloved by teenagers. It is best known for its free \"Battle Royale\" mode, where 100 players duke it out until only one combatant or squad remains. About a year ago, Epic said \"Fortnite\" had more than 350 million registered accounts.</p><p>The game faces competition in the genre from the likes of Electronic Arts Inc.'s \"Apex Legends\" and Activision Blizzard Inc.'s \"Call of Duty: Warzone.\" Epic has sought to expand the appeal of \"Fortnite\" by adding characters from Walt Disney's Marvel universe and hosting in-game concerts with artists such as Travis Scott.</p><p>\"Fortnite\" made its debut on computers before coming to consoles and eventually mobile devices. The game stood out for supporting what is known as crossplay, or the ability for people to join a match together while using different types of devices and brands. For example, someone playing \"Fortnite\" on Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox could team up with someone playing on Sony's PlayStation and, until last year, on an Apple- or Google-powered phone.</p><p>Epic is now suing Apple and Alphabet Inc.'s Google for removing \"Fortnite\" from their app stores after Epic introduced a new in-game payment system that would skirt the 30% fee certain developers are required to pay the companies for in-app purchases.</p><p>Epic has accused the companies of monopolistic behavior in how they distribute apps to devices and process sales for digital content. It is set to take on Apple in court next month, while a trial date for its case against Google hasn't been determined. The legal dispute reeled in several other large companies, with Epic seeking testimony from a senior executive at online-dating company Match Group Inc., and Apple having subpoenaed Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.</p><p>Separately, Facebook Inc., which is unhappy with Apple over issues including privacy, has pledged to support Epic in its fight to prove that the hardware company is misusing its power over the digital ecosystem that it has created for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Epic's higher valuation reflects the strength of the videogame sector, which has thrived over the past year as more people flocked to videogames while staying home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Global consumer spending on game software increased about 20% in 2020 to reach nearly $175 billion, according to estimates from industry tracker Newzoo BV.</p><p>Also in 2020, U.S. videogame companies raised $3.9 billion in venture capital, up from $1.1 billion in 2019, according to PitchBook, a provider of private-market data. And U.S. venture-backed companies overall raised more than $62 billion in the first quarter, a quarterly record that is more than double from a year earlier and 62% higher than the previous quarter, according to market-intelligence firm CB Insights.</p><p>Discord Inc., a chat startup popular among gamers, doubled its valuation to $7 billion after a financing round in December. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Microsoft is in exclusive talks to buy Discord for $10 billion or more.</p><p>Several game companies have gone public within the past year, including developers Roblox Corp. and Playtika Holding Corp., game-hardware maker Corsair Gaming Inc. and game-creation tool provider Unity Software Inc.</p><p>For its part, Epic hasn't announced plans for a public offering. A spokeswoman for the company said it is \"always monitoring the market and is prepared to consider opportunities as they arise.\"</p>",
