  "title": "REVIEW  ---  What Gene  Editing Can Do  For -2-",
  "text": "<p>   Imagine a world in which genetic engineering is determined mainly by individual free choice, with few government regulations and no pesky bioethics panels to set limits. You would go into a fertility clinic and be given, as if you were at a genetic supermarket, a list of traits that you can buy for your children. Would you eliminate serious genetic diseases? Of course. I personally would also ensure that my children wouldn't have genes leading to blindness or deafness. How about avoiding below-average height, above-average weight or low IQ? Many of us would probably select those options too. I might even pick a premium-priced option for extra height and IQ. Some people might even rationalize choosing their child's sex and sexual orientation. </p><p>   At that point, gene editing really does start to look more like a genuinely slippery slope. Without gates or flags, we might all go barreling down at uncontrollable speed, taking society's diversity with us. Permitting parents to buy the best genes for their children would also exacerbate inequality. The social bond that arises from the American creed that all people \"are created equal\" would be severed if we turn financial inequalities into genetic inequalities. </p><p>   When it became clear that the CRISPR tool that she had co-invented could be used to edit human genes, Jennifer Doudna had a \"visceral, knee-jerk reaction.\" The idea of changing a child's genes, she says, felt unnatural. \"In the early days, I was instinctively against it.\" </p><p>   But then she began to hear stories from people who had been affected by genetic diseases. \"The ones about kids were especially touching to me as a mother,\" she says. We should be cautious, she came to feel, about imposing a moratorium or hard-and-fast restrictions. As one participant said at a conference that Dr. Doudna organized, \"Someday we may consider it unethical not to use inheritable gene editing to alleviate human suffering.\" </p><p>   My own opinions about gene editing have also evolved. When I first began reporting on the topic, I sat on the balcony of my home in the French Quarter of New Orleans and tried to process my thoughts. </p><p>   The French Quarter was hopping that weekend. There was a naked bicycle race intended (oddly enough) to promote traffic safety. There were parades to celebrate the life of the Creole chef and civil rights pioneer Leah Chase. There was the annual Gay Pride Parade and related block parties. And coexisting quite happily with all this was the French Market Creole Tomato Festival, featuring truck farmers and cooks showing off the many varieties of succulent, non-genetically-modified local tomatoes. </p><p>   From my balcony, I marveled at the human diversity passing below: short and tall, gay and straight and trans, fat and skinny, light and dark. A cluster of young people wandered by wearing Gallaudet University T-shirts and speaking in sign language. </p><p>   The supposed promise of CRISPR is that we may someday pick which of these traits we want in our children and all our descendants. But the sight of the bustling French Quarter, with all of its exuberant variety, suggested to me that CRISPR's promise might also be its peril. It took nature millions of years to weave together three billion base pairs of DNA into a complex -- and often imperfect -- way to permit all the wondrous diversity within our species. Are we right to think that we should now edit that genome to eliminate what we see as imperfections? Will we lose our diversity? Our humility and empathy? Will we become less flavorful, like our tomatoes? </p><p>   I still worry about that. But the advances in CRISPR technology, combined with the havoc wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, have pushed me to be more open to gene editing. I now see the promise of CRISPR more clearly than the peril. If we are wise in how we use it, biotechnology can make us more able to fend off lethal viruses and overcome serious genetic defects. </p><p>   After millions of centuries during which evolution happened \"naturally,\" humans now can hack the code of life and engineer our own genetic futures. Or, for those who decry gene editing as \"playing God,\" let's put it this way: Nature and nature's God, in their wisdom, have evolved a species that can modify its own genome. </p><p>   Like any evolutionary trait, this new ability may help our species to thrive -- and perhaps even produce successor species. Or it may not. It could be one of those evolutionary traits that leads a species down a path that endangers its survival. Evolution is fickle that way. </p><p>   This is why it is useful for all of us to try to understand this new room that we are about to enter, one that seems mysterious but can also fill us with hope. Not everything needs to be decided right away. We can begin by asking what type of world we want to leave for our children. Then we can feel our way forward together, step by step, and preferably hand in hand. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Isaacson's books include biographies of Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs.
