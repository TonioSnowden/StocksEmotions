  "title": "Twitter, Apple Resolve Differences After Meeting",
  "text": "<p>\"Good conversation,\" Mr. Musk wrote. \"Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.\"</p><p>The suggestion of a detente was first raised when Mr. Musk tweeted a video that appeared to be taken on the parklike setting of Apple headquarters. His latest missive came just two days after the new Twitter boss launched a barrage of attacks on the iPhone maker's App Store and advertising.</p><p>\"Thanks @tim_cook for taking me around Apple's beautiful HQ,\" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Mr. Musk on Monday accused Apple of stanching free speech and claiming that the tech giant had threatened to kick the Twitter app off the iPhone.</p><p>Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A meeting between Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, and Mr. Cook, head of the world's most valuable company, was an unexpected outcome, with the two appearing to be on a collision course following Monday's broadside by Mr. Musk. Still, both Twitter and Apple have many reasons to keep the peace.</p><p>Apple is one of Twitter's biggest advertisers and controls access to its iPhone and its more than one billion users. Mr. Musk has said Apple threatened to take Twitter's app off the App Store, the digital marketplace where iPhone users download third-party software.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's push back against Apple threatens to pull the iPhone maker further into the crosshairs of Republican lawmakers nervous about the power Silicon Valley holds. Mr. Musk has framed his fight with Apple as one against Big Tech squashing freedom of speech.</p><p>Before Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter about a month ago, he and Mr. Cook seemingly had little overlap in their business lives. In 2021, Mr. Cook said he had never spoken with Mr. Musk, though the two men had shared time around a table with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Mr. Musk, whose fortune is tied up mostly in Tesla Inc. and rocket company SpaceX, has said he once reached out to Mr. Cook for help when the electric car maker was struggling to increase production of the Model 3 compact car and its finances were strained. Mr. Cook never took that meeting.</p><p>Wednesday's visit apparently included a stop at the pond on Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., according to video shared by Mr. Musk.</p><p>Since his takeover, some advertisers have restrained spending amid concerns about his ability to rein in objectionable content on the platform and the rapid pace of change at the company. Mr. Musk has said the company is losing $4 million a day and warned employees that bankruptcy isn't out of the question.</p><p>He is racing to remake Twitter's business.</p><p>That has included slashing costs, including laying off about half of the company, and efforts to boost nonad revenue through a beefier subscription service that promises to deliver Twitter's famed blue check mark to users for a price.</p><p>The check marks had once been given away free to high-profile users as a way to verify identity but have become seen by some as classist.</p><p>The rollout of the new service has been hit with snags. A fight with Apple could further threaten its distribution through the App Store.</p><p>Traditionally, Apple warns app developers about concerns it may have or requests for changes and software makers are given a couple of weeks to address issues. If they choose not to make the fixes or resist, Apple has declined to allow apps to be updated through the App Store. In rare cases, it has deleted apps from its App store.</p><p>About 64% of Twitter users in the U.S. use Apple's mobile operating system for iPhone or iPad compared with 36% using Alphabet Inc.'s Android, according to Sensor Tower data.</p>",
