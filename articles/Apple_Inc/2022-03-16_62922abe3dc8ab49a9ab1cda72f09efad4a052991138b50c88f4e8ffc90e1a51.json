  "title": "China's Covid-19 Cases Drop as Restrictions Disrupt Business; Tesla, Foxconn show challenges of navigating rapidly changing local policies",
  "text": "<p>Companies must navigate rapidly changing restrictions, making it hard to gauge the extent of the impact on China's economy and global supply chains. In the southern tech hub and export powerhouse of Shenzhen, Apple Inc. assembler Foxconn Technology Group said it had been given approval to resume some operations; Tesla Inc. said it would suspend production at its Shanghai factory; and tighter controls on taking goods between provinces threatened to disrupt the nation's logistics sector.</p><p>Whether China can contain the outbreaks quickly could have deep implications for the global economy. Half of China's exports are produced in areas now experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks, and three quarters of its exports are shipped from them, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. It is still possible that infections could be suppressed without causing widespread disruption to global supply chains as it has for previous outbreaks, Mr. Williams wrote in a Wednesday note, but the risk that global supply chains' links within China get severed is the highest that it has been in two years.</p><p>Shares in Chinese companies staged a rebound Wednesday after Beijing moved to reassure investors rattled by the prospect of widespread factory closures and disruption to trade. Shares have sold off sharply in recent days because of concerns about the lockdowns, as well as issues including U.S. delistings and Beijing's long-running series of regulatory crackdowns.</p><p>Officials pledged to \"keep the economy operating within a reasonable range\" by coordinating Covid-19 containment policies, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported Wednesday.</p><p>In recent days, Chinese officials reported increasing Covid-19 case numbers across the country that prompted more aggressive containment measures, from shutting down public transportation in Shenzhen to ordering residents to stay home in Changchun, the capital of Jilin province.</p><p>New infections reported on Wednesday fell by more than a third to 3,054, with almost half of the cases found in the northeastern province of Jilin. Since Monday, its 24 million people haven't been allowed to leave the province as authorities race to halt the outbreak and prevent it from spreading. After logging more than 4,000 infections on Monday, new cases there fell to 1,456. Jilin said it had already built eight makeshift hospitals with a total of 11,488 beds.</p><p>In neighboring Liaoning province, authorities said they would suspend public transportation and online taxi services in the coastal city of Yingkou.</p><p>Dongguan, another major manufacturing hub in Guangdong province, on Monday announced what it termed \"the beginning of temporary slow life.\" Authorities there suspended dining-in services and placed more stringent controls on factories.</p><p>On Wednesday, Taiwan-based Foxconn said it was able to restart some operations at Shenzhen campuses where workers live in dormitories alongside assembly lines, in accordance with policies issued by the city government. The company had earlier reported that its Shenzhen factories would be closed for a week.</p><p>Officials in Shanghai said Tuesday they had no plans for a citywide shutdown and would for now take more targeted measures to tackle the outbreak. The financial hub reported 202 cases on Wednesday, of which 197 were asymptomatic. City authorities ordered indoor businesses and schools to close in recent days, while a number of residential compounds have been locked down temporarily as residents were tested for the virus.</p><p>Tesla, which makes Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in the city, told employees and suppliers that it would halt production for Wednesday and Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. The electric car maker gave no reasons for the suspension, they said. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Tesla sold more than 56,000 cars made there in February, nearly 60% of which were exported outside China, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed.</p><p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world's biggest battery maker, said its business—including a factory close to Tesla's—was running as usual.</p><p>Meantime, the spotlight has swung onto China's giant express delivery industry—with the country already the world leader in online shopping, Covid-19 had given the industry a shot in the arm as more consumers shunned crowded places and ordered goods to their doors. Now delivery workers and the parcels themselves have been blamed for spreading infections.</p><p>Local media reported clusters of infections or identified close contacts among SF Express Co. workers, where groups had to undergo quarantine. SF Express couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>An online chat with a customer service robot from SF Express showed disruptions to same-day deliveries in Hangzhou and citywide temporary halts to deliveries in Wenzhou, among others. No packages would be sent for now to Huzhou and Ningbo, other cities in Zhejiang province.</p><p>United Parcel Service Inc. also issued service alerts. Pickup and delivery were suspended in Shenzhen and Dongguan, while in Zhejiang province and elsewhere imported items would be set aside for four to seven days for sanitization, the company's website said.</p><p>Zhao Yueling, Raffaele Huang and Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com</p><p>China's Covid-19 Cases Drop as Restrictions Disrupt Business</p>",
