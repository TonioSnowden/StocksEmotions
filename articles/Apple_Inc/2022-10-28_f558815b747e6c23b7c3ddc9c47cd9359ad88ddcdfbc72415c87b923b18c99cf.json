  "text": "<p>* Generous standard equipment</p><p>* Eligible for incentives</p><p>Cons</p><p>* So-so recharge times</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* Premium AWD now capable of 290 miles</p><p>* BlueCruise offered with Select trim</p><p>* Fixed panoramic roof standard on GT</p><p>The 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E is an all-electric compact SUV with great tech and good range. Prices start at $46,895 before any federal tax credits, state incentives, free charging, destination charges, or options.</p><p>It rides a little higher than a regular car and some variants come with all-wheel drive. Yet it also has a sloped roof, so it's not quite as practical as a regular SUV. Whatever it is, though, the 2023 Mustang Mach-E is an excellent electric vehicle, or EV.</p><p>Maximum range is 312 miles, achieved by the California Route 1 version, which is close to the Tesla TSLA Model Y's range. That's the distance covered when starting out with a full battery and running down to almost empty.</p><p>Ford F makes a couple of seriously sporty variants as well, making use of another electric benefit — accessible power. Every version of the 2023 Mustang Mach-E has something going for it, however.</p><p>We named last year's model a KBB Best Buy for its class. So yes, we're fans.</p><p>Just to clarify one thing — this isn't an electric version of the famed Mustang. It doesn't really share anything with that sports car except for the name, similar taillights, and a couple of horsey badges.</p><p>2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E pricing</p><p>The 2023 Mustang Mach-E has a starting price of $46,895, plus a destination charge. That's for the Select trim with rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is an extra $2,700, which applies to the Premium trim as well.</p><p>Premium is priced from almost $55K. An extended-range battery is offered with this trim at $8,600.</p><p>The California Route 1 model (now with all-wheel drive as standard) starts at just over $63.5K. The top GT model is just under $70K. The GT Performance Edition package (including an adaptive suspension) is $6,000, and the most expensive premium paint is $795.</p><p>The financial silver lining to these pricey clouds is the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 (electric vehicles from Chevrolet and Tesla currently don't qualify). Various states may also offer incentives. For example, the California Clean Vehicle Rebate program will give $2,000 to anyone who buys or leases a new Mustang Mach-E. New York offers $500.</p><p>See: Thinking about an EV? First-ever $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles, and $7,500 for new, gets OK from Congress</p><p>Ford also includes 250 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of free fast charging on the Electrify America network.</p><p>Other electric vehicles creating a buzz right now include the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6, both starting in the low 40s. The Volkswagen ID.4 is almost $38K, and the Tesla Model Y is about $66K (with a range of 318 miles and all-wheel drive as standard). The smaller Chevrolet Bolt EUV starts at just over $28K and has a range of 247 miles.</p><p>Before buying a new Mustang Mach-E electric car, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. The Mustang Mach-E has already been recognized by KBB for its strong resale values.</p><p>Check out: The cars, trucks and SUVs with the best resale value</p><p>Driving the 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E</p><p>Standstill to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds is wonderfully fast and thrilling. That's the driver appeal of electric drivetrains, the delivery of maximum torque as if flicking a switch. This brisk time is achieved by the GT Performance Edition, made possible by its considerable 634 lb-ft of torque.</p><p>Not that the regular GT is slow. It's only 34 lb-ft shy and slower by just 0.3 of a second. The slowest 2023 Mustang Mach-E electric SUV is the Premium with rear-wheel drive and the extended-range battery. Even then, 6.1 seconds isn't bad, and it's in keeping with the Premium trim's more luxurious character anyway.</p><p>The battery pack is mounted under the floor, creating a raised ride height while still contributing to a low center of gravity. The Mustang Mach-E feels nice and stable, although still comfortable. The GT Performance Edition does come with an adaptive suspension, though, offering sportier dynamics.</p><p>Driving modes are Whisper (great for commutes and long freeway stretches alike), Engage (a bit of excitement coming through), and Unbridled — exploiting those electric motors to the full.</p><p>Like most EVs, the Mustang Mach-E also does the one-pedal driving trick. By setting the brake energy regeneration to maximum, the vehicle's progress is controlled just by using the throttle, while lifting off completely can bring it to a halt. We've found this to be particularly useful during the mayhem of city traffic.</p><p>Also read: 3 reasons the Hyundai Ioniq 6 makes the Tesla Model 3 seem a bit boring</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Technology is front and center, thanks to a massive 15.5-inch infotainment touchscreen set vertically. This is complemented by a 10.2-inch digital driver information display that comes as standard in every new Mustang Mach-E SUV.</p><p>Even the base Select trim has an 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, while the upholstery is a decent-quality simulated leather. The GT's seating surfaces include inserts of a suede-like cloth material.</p><p>The sloping roof might suggest constricted space for rear passengers, but a couple of average-sized adults should be happy with the amount of headroom and legroom. For the driver, outward vision is also acceptable.</p><p>Cargo space opens up from 29.7 cubic feet to 59.7 when the rear seats are folded down. That's quite similar to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV. There's also a storage area under the hood.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The Nite Pony cosmetics bundle ($800) is new this year. Applicable to the Premium trim with the extended-range battery and the GT Performance Edition, this package adds exterior elements finished in high-gloss black. It's also available with any paint choice.</p><p>On that subject, Carbonized Gray Metallic and Vapor Blue Metallic are new colors for the 2023 Mustang Mach-E SUV lineup, replacing similar hues. The black roof of the GT and GT Performance Edition variants is also gone, making way for a standard fixed-glass panoramic roof.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>1. Charge management The special Ford home charger available with the 2023 Mustang Mach-E EV can be controlled and monitored by using a smartphone app, Amazon AMZN Alexa, or Google GOOGL Home.</p><p>2. Infotainment touchscreen It shows a Tesla influence with its size and orientation, but that's no bad thing. This 15.5-inch screen has superb graphics, can be controlled using smartphone-like gestures, and is part of a user-friendly system that includes natural voice recognition, Wi-Fi, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and wireless device charging.</p><p>3. Phone as a Key This allows users to access their Mustang Mach-E using a smartphone app. They can also open the trunk and the hood, activate the horn and lights, and open or close the windows — all remotely.</p><p>4. BlueCruise This adaptive cruise control system allows hands-free driving on certain highways. However, the driver's eyes must still be kept on the road.</p><p>5. Drainable front storage area Under the hood is an extra 4.7 cubic feet of storage that comes with a drain plug, so it can be filled with ice and used as a cooler.</p><p>6. Bang &amp; Olufsen audio One way to enjoy the otherwise quiet cabin of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E is to turn up the volume of this high-quality 10-speaker system. Standard in the Premium and GT/GT Performance models.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>Select and Premium versions of the 2023 Mustang Mach-E share the same setups. Variants with the standard-range battery and rear-wheel drive have a single electric motor developing 266 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. With a second electric motor driving the front wheels (creating an electronic form of all-wheel drive), horsepower stays the same, but torque increases to 428 lb-ft.</p><p>Premium then goes on its own journey with the optional extended-range battery. Although torque figures remain the same, a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) version makes 290 horsepower and one with all-wheel drive (AWD) generates 346 horsepower.</p><p>These higher output numbers also apply to the California Route 1 version, now with AWD as standard.</p><p>GT versions pack a mightier punch. Both the straight-ahead GT and the GT Performance Edition have 480 horsepower, but torque is either 600 lb-ft in the GT or 634 lb-ft in the GT Performance Edition. AWD is standard here.</p><p>In combination with RWD, the standard-range lithium-ion battery in the Select and Premium models has a range of 247 miles. With AWD, that shortens to 224 miles. The extended-range battery (also lithium-ion), which is optional in the Premium, can cover either 306 miles (RWD) or 290 miles (AWD) — a little hike of 13 miles over last year's AWD version.</p><p>California Route 1 and GT variants come with the extended-range battery as standard. The California Route 1 has the best range of the 2023 Mustang Mach-E lineup: 312 miles.</p><p>It's 270 miles for the GT or 260 miles for the GT Performance Edition.</p><p>A DC fast charger can replenish the battery from 10% to 80% in approximately 45 minutes. A dedicated Ford home charging station is capable of adding 28 miles of range per hour it's connected. Or plan on something like 11 hours for a full recharge using a 240-volt system.</p><p>These miles-per-gallon-equivalent (MPGe) figures and estimated ranges from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relate to 2022, but we expect 2023's to be close.</p><p>Mustang Mach-E Select &amp; Premium w/standard battery 266 horsepower 317 lb-ft of torque (RWD) 428 lb-ft of torque (AWD) EPA city/highway fuel economy: 110/96 MPGe (RWD), 99/86 MPGe (AWD) EPA-estimated range: 247 miles (RWD), 224 miles (AWD)</p><p>Mustang Mach-E Premium w/extended-range battery 290 horsepower 317 lb-ft of torque EPA city/highway fuel economy: 104/90 MPGe EPA-estimated range: 306 miles</p><p>Mustang Mach-E Premium AWD w/extended-range battery &amp; California Route 1 346 horsepower 428 lb-ft of torque EPA city/highway fuel economy: 97/84 MPGe (Premium), 105/91 MPGe (California Route 1) EPA-estimated range: 290 miles (Premium AWD), 312 miles (California Route 1)</p><p>Mustang Mach-E GT and GT Performance Edition 480 horsepower 600 lb-ft of torque (GT) 634 lb-ft of torque (GT Performance Edition) EPA city/highway fuel economy: 90/77 MPGe (GT), 88/75 MPGe (GT Performance Edition) EPA-estimated range: 270 miles (GT), 260 miles (GT Performance Edition)</p><p>3/36 warranty</p><p>A typical Ford new-car warranty of 3 years or 36,000 miles (whichever occurs first) applies to the 2023 Mustang Mach-E.
