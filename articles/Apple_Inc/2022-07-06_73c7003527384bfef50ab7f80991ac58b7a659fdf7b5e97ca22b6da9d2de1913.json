  "text": "<p>   Short sellers are easing off their bets of pain ahead in the stock market. </p><p>   Total U.S. short selling rose by $20 billion in June, according to technology and data-analytics company S3 Partners. That was down from a $61 billion increase in May and less than most months in 2022. </p><p>   Investors shorting the market might be placing an outright bet that stocks will fall, or reducing their exposure to a market downturn while betting that particular stocks will outperform. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the profit. A slowdown in shorts could signal investors believe stocks are nearing lows and prepping for a rebound. </p><p>   \"You always want to short when the market's at a high and stop shorting when the market's at the bottom,\" said Bob Doll, chief investment officer at Crossmark Global Investments. </p><p>   Mr. Doll said his firm began betting against stocks that he thought were overpriced at the beginning of the fourth quarter and through the first quarter. The firm has since pared back some of those positions, he said. </p><p>   It has been a bruising year for stocks, so far. After three years of double-digit gains, the market has been shocked by decades-high inflation and the Federal Reserve's rate-increasing campaign to try to curb it. Bearish wagers surged earlier this year as investors positioned for a stock selloff. The S&amp;P 500 fell 21% this year through Thursday, its worst first-half performance since 1970, according to Dow Jones Market Data. (It rose on Friday, the first day of the second half of the year.) </p><p>   One potential silver lining: A bad first half doesn't guarantee a bad second half. When the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% in the first six months of the year, it has risen an average of 24% in the second half, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p><p>   If stocks do indeed recover, markets might see an uptick in short covering, as short sellers buy back shares to close out their positions. </p><p>   The options market has similarly indicated that fears among investors are moderating. One options measure, known as skew, has collapsed. Bearish options tied to the S&amp;P 500 have grown relatively less expensive than bullish ones that would pay out if stocks rose, according to Bank of America Corp. analysts. That means some traders are growing less concerned by the risk of a steeper fall in the stock market than by the risk of a rally. To be sure, some investors expect the market to keep falling and are continuing to short stocks. Short sellers added $6.3 billion to their positions against the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust in June, up from $4.5 billion in shares shorted in May, according to S3 Partners. </p><p>   Recently, some of the most popular shorts in the U.S. -- such as flashy tech companies and other growth stocks -- experienced the biggest increase in short selling. Growth stocks fell sharply this year, but the short selling signals that some investors expect more pain ahead for the group. Investors added roughly $1.2 billion each in their short positions against Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. in June, according to S3 Partners. Tesla Inc. remains the largest short in the U.S., with nearly $19 billion in short interest. All three names are underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this year. </p><p></p>",
