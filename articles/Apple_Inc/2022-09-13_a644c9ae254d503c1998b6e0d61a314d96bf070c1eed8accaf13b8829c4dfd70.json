  "text": "<p>Think twice before calling the electoral gains of the nationalist, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats a dangerous turning point in Swedish and European politics. Democracy and the rule of law in Sweden are not at risk. Nor are the country's decisive steps in favour of full integration into transatlantic security structures.</p> <p>What is true is that, as in other European democracies, the Swedish hard right has succeeded in shaping the policies of less extreme parties on the right around its own themes. In the UK, it was Brexit; in France, militant Islam; and in Sweden, it is immigration, violent crime and national identity.</p> <p>The Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the fringe white supremacist and neo-Nazi scene of the late 20th century, was until recent times treated like a polecat by other parties, including the Moderates, the mainstream conservatives. But <a href=\"https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/eem/1989-social-democrats-lead-in-polls-but-populist-sweden-democrats-could-make-a-breakthrough-in-the-11-september-general-election\">that changed in 2020</a> when the Moderates expressed a readiness to co-operate with the Sweden Democrats, justifying the move by saying the party had gradually abandoned its extremism.</p> <p>In Sunday's general election, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed8e683a-f65e-4848-b83f-a65883f75db9\">Sweden Democrats</a> achieved their best result since they first won seats in parliament in 2010. With about 20 per cent of the vote, they came second behind the ruling Social Democrats and emerged as the largest party on the right, just ahead of the Moderates.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if a rightwing coalition will come to power and, if so, whether the Sweden Democrats will form part of it. There is considerable <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/swedish-far-right-vying-for-pm-position-ahead-of-elections-results/?utm_source=piano&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=24428&amp;pnespid=srI8EitZOaMd2fSZ_DSoHo2K5Aq2CJV8LOu6yrFsrURmp8og4bSNsuWdFx0P1xfzJ9My_1dw.g\">reluctance among mainstream parties</a> to take that sensitive step. But even if the party were confined to offering parliamentary support to a minority coalition, they would have influence over government policies.</p> <p>What will not change are the fundamentals of Swedish foreign and defence policy. The Sweden Democrats support the nation's application to join Nato. Party leader <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-migration-stockholm-sweden-6f5215360665e97b7d928f69beb7139f\">Jimmie Akesson has condemned</a> Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and, during the election campaign, said: “Today, Russia is more or less a full-scale dictatorship.”</p> <p>The Sweden Democrats have also dropped their old hostility to the country's EU membership. Beyond that, Sweden's democratic processes and upholding of the rule of law remain strong. This makes Sweden a very different case from Hungary, marked by years of democratic backsliding under Viktor Orbán, and Poland with its undermining of judicial independence.</p> <p>Arguably, more grounds for concern surround Italy's election on September 25. The rightwing coalition that appears set for victory includes the hard-right League, which signed a co-operation pact in 2017 with Putin's United Russia party, and whose leader, Matteo Salvini, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/cracks-show-in-meloni-salvini-alliance-over-russia-sanctions-italy\">questions the usefulness</a> of western sanctions on Moscow. Yet Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy, which is leading in opinion polls, backs the western stance on Russia.</p> <p>More troubling is that the rightwing coalition <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0d78778-2d10-47e6-88a9-6fc70356fa9d\">may try to rewrite</a> the terms of Italy's access to the EU's post-pandemic recovery fund. This is one of several areas where doubts persist about the coalition's commitment to the economic and administrative reforms begun by Mario Draghi's national unity government.</p> <p>In Sweden, the central cause of the hard right's rise has been the struggle to cope with large-scale immigration. About 20 per cent of Sweden's 10.5mn inhabitants are foreign-born, with some 240,000 asylum seekers having arrived during the European refugee crisis of 2014-2015.</p> <p>The Sweden Democrats link immigration to rising levels of gang warfare and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62612215\">gun killings</a> in what was once one of Europe's most peaceful societies. Yet all Swedish parties now recognise there is a problem with crime and the integration of often relatively poor immigrants. Magdalena Andersson, Sweden's Social Democratic prime minister, has said: “Segregation is so strong that we have two parallel societies in Sweden.”</p> <p>What marks out the Sweden Democrats on this subject is their coarse, abrasive language. During the election campaign, Tobias Andersson, their criminal justice affairs spokesman, posted a picture of a train carriage with these words directed at immigrants: “Welcome to the repatriation train. You have a one-way ticket. Next stop, Kabul.”</p> <p>The Sweden Democrats differ from insurgent rightwing parties in Norway or Finland <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f725372-b44b-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe\">whose traditions</a> lie more in libertarianism or agrarian populism. Under Akesson, who took over as party leader in 2005, the Sweden Democrats have expelled their most extremist members and changed their logo from a flame to a flower. Yet it may take more than that to persuade the political establishment that the Sweden Democrats deserve a spell in power.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.barber@ft.com\"><em>tony.barber@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Tony Barber 2022 'The hard right's election breakthrough has upset the Swedish apple cart' FT.com 13 September.
