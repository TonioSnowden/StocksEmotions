  "title": "LIV Golf COO Departs at Key Moment for the Saudi-backed Circuit's Future; Atul Khosla has exited as LIV tries to land the media-rights deals and sponsors that will determine the enterprise's financial viability.",
  "text": "<p>Khosla, who previously worked for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Football League, was listed second from the top of LIV's leadership on its website, beneath only chief executive officer Greg Norman.</p><p>\"At the conclusion of LIV's successful inaugural season, Atul Khosla decided to move on,\" Norman said in a statement. \"We are working closely with some of our most trusted partners, who have been integral since LIV's inception and are supporting our structural transition and introduction of exciting new developments ahead of our first full season.\"</p><p>While LIV Golf has spent lavishly in its effort to shake up the golf world and challenge the establishment PGA Tour, it has yet to demonstrate that it has drummed up enough interest to generate a return on that immense investment.</p><p>LIV, financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is already backed by at least $2 billion in funding. That has been devoted to record-setting prizes at tournaments and lucrative appearance fees, some of which reportedly exceed $100 million and have lured superstar golfers such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson away from the PGA Tour.</p><p>But LIV has thus far failed to tap the primary source of financial success in professional sports: television money. Primarily, LIV has yet to strike a major media-rights deal in the United States despite also shelling out big sums for big-name broadcasters. LIV's inaugural tournaments this year aired for free on platforms such as YouTube.</p><p>LIV's options in that space appear to be limited. CBS, NBC and ESPN have deals with the PGA Tour, which is at odds with LIV both in the court of public opinion and actual courtrooms. Big name streamers Apple and Amazon have already turned LIV down, people familiar with the matter previously said.</p><p>LIV has also struggled to nail down sponsors. ROSHN, a real-estate developer, sponsored the LIV tournament that was played outside Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, but ROSHN is also backed by the kingdom's Public Investment Fund.</p><p>Whether any real outside backers will be keen on working with LIV remains to be determined. Critics, including many U.S. politicians, have labeled LIV an exercise in \"sportswashing\"—or using the popularity of golf to improve Saudi Arabia's global reputation after human rights abuses such as the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>LIV has repeatedly said its mission is to grow the game of golf internationally with a fun new format. The players compete in 54-hole tournaments, as opposed to the typical 72, in small fields without a cut. There's also a team element to the events.</p><p>\"We think that there is a way to make the game younger, faster, to package it up completely differently,\" Khosla said on The Journal podcast in August. \"I'm not sure how many 30-year-olds or 35-year-olds are going to watch golf Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday for eight hours. Could we reimagine how that is completely done?\"</p><p>LIV is also in an increasingly contentious feud with the PGA Tour, which has suspended the golfers who have left. LIV and a handful of players are suing the Tour, accusing it of behaving as a monopolist to squash a competitor. The PGA Tour has countersued LIV for interfering in its deals with players.</p><p>—Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>LIV Golf COO Departs at Key Moment for the Saudi-backed Circuit's Future</p>",
