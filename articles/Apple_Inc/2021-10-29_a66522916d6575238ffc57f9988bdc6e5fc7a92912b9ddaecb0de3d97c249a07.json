  "text": "<p>Personal income slumped 1% in September after a 0.2% gain in the prior month. Economists were looking for a 0.4% decline.</p><p>As a result, the personal savings rate fell to 7.5% from 9.2% in the prior month. That's slightly below its pre-pandemic level.</p><p>Wages and salaries rose a solid 0.8% in September.</p><p>The 12-month increase in the PCE index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose to 4.4% in September from 4.2% in the prior month. That's well above the Fed's 2% annual target rate.</p><p>The core PCE rate that strips out food and energy held steady at 3.6% on an annual basis.</p><p>Key details: The drop in personal income reflected the expiration of supplemental jobless benefits, economists said.</p><p>“Core” PCE was slightly firmer than expected, rising 0.2% in September after a 0.3% gain in the prior month.</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, real consumer spending rose 0.3% in September after a 0.6% gain in the prior month. Consumers spent more on health care and food. Spending on durable goods fell due to shortages at auto dealers.</p><p>Big picture: U.S. gross domestic product decelerated to a 2% growth rate in the third quarter. Economists are counting on higher consumer spending to power a rebound in the economy in the final three months of the year. At the moment, economists expect a rebound in growth in the fourth quarter, but expectations were also high for the third quarter but steadily declined as time went on.</p><p>The financial cushion built up by consumers during the pandemic is being eroded, as households have to pay more for goods and services as a result of higher inflation. The savings rate averaged 7.6% in 2019.</p><p>What are they saying: “The 0.3% rise in real personal spending in September is consistent with consumption growth remaining muted going into the fourth quarter, as shortages and surging prices remain a drag,” said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Market reaction: Stocks DJIASPX opened lower on Friday after disappointing results from Amazon and Apple.</p>",
