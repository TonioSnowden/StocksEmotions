  "title": "Yellen Seeks to Win European Support for a Tax Deal Congress Hasn't Approved; Treasury secretary to meet next week with officials in Poland, a holdout in EU on global minimum tax",
  "text": "<p>Crafted after months of negotiations last year, the proposal to institute a 15% minimum tax on the profits of large corporations ultimately won the support of 137 countries. Since the initial agreement, though, the economies of the U.S. and EU have so far been slow to enact laws executing the plan, with Poland recently vetoing an EU measure to implement it by the end of 2023.</p><p>The global minimum tax—together with a parallel push to give countries the power to collect taxes from companies based on business revenue generated from their citizens—would amount to the broadest overhaul of international tax rules in more than a century. Approval by the EU and U.S. could help prod other countries to finish their pieces of the agreement.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is a global minimum tax on companies a good idea? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Cementing the tax deal would be a central achievement for Ms. Yellen, who has cast it as a critical step toward stopping the efforts of multinational corporations to avoid taxes. Not only would failure pose a challenge to U.S. economic leadership, it could make it harder for countries to raise revenue and leave U.S. companies more vulnerable to targeted taxes.</p><p>Ms. Yellen is set to travel to Warsaw, as well as Brussels, before heading to Bonn, Germany, for a gathering of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading nations. She said recently that she expects Poland to soon drop its objections to the plan, opening the door to EU approval and possibly assuaging concerns in Congress that the U.S. would raise its taxes but that other countries wouldn't follow suit.</p><p>\"I really expect the EU to pass this into the law this spring and I think that would be a good example to the United States to show a very significant piece of the economic activity in the world has come into compliance and it sets a good example for us,\" she said at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council last week.</p><p>Poland has argued against the EU moving forward with the implementation of the minimum tax, a priority for the U.S., without making more progress on the other element of the agreement: A reassignment of taxing powers that would see technology companies pay more taxes in Europe. Ms. Yellen is expected to make the case to top Polish officials that the minimum tax will deliver economic benefits to Poland, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.</p><p>Poland is currently the only country in the 27-member EU holding up the deal, which requires unanimous support. Under a streamlined process, the minimum tax will go into effect once agreed upon by every EU country.</p><p>Yet, even as Ms. Yellen prepares to cajole leaders in Europe to advance the deal, she and the Biden administration have struggled to persuade lawmakers in their own political party in Washington to move it forward. Democrats have long planned to include the global minimum tax in a broader economic package that would raise taxes and shower spending on climate, healthcare and education programs.</p><p>Those plans have foundered, though, as Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has opposed the breadth of spending in the broader package, raising concerns about its impact on the deficit and the highest inflation in decades. Democrats, who need Mr. Manchin's support for legislation in the 50-50 Senate, have struggled for months to revive the broader bill, as some Democrats fret that they will fail to pass anything before the midterm elections.</p><p>On its own, Democrats believe they have sufficient political support to approve the global minimum tax deal, but they have not yet moved to break it off into a smaller piece of legislation. Mr. Manchin has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. tax code needs to be competitive globally, though European approval of the global minimum tax might not accelerate the Senate's consideration of it.</p><p>\"Even with the flow of a river, logs can jam up in a way such that nothing goes downriver. We've got to undo the logjam,\" said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D., Colo).</p><p>While talks on the contours of the international tax agreement began during the Trump administration, Republicans have said the Biden administration hasn't consulted them sufficiently on the deal and the impact it could have on U.S. businesses. They have raised concerns about whether parts of the deal could ultimately cost American companies more in taxes while not netting the U.S. government more revenue.</p><p>Policy makers still have details of the tax deal to hammer out. Some U.S. businesses have raised concerns about how the global minimum tax might affect tax credits they receive for corporate research and renewable energy.</p><p>Under the international deal, U.S.-based multinational companies that pay less than 15% in U.S. taxes because of credits they receive could face additional taxes in other countries where they operate. That design is aimed to make sure there is an enforcement mechanism for the 15% floor.</p><p>Lily Batchelder, the top tax-policy official at the Treasury Department, said at a recent D.C. Bar conference that she was confident that U.S. tax breaks for low-income housing, investment in low-income areas and renewable energy would be preserved under the deal. She said U.S. officials have been working with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on a clarification.</p><p>Negotiators are also still working through a series of details on what's known as Pillar One, the proposed new rules for shifting taxing power away from countries where corporations have their headquarters and intellectual property and toward places where they generate revenue from consumers. That is really important to European countries frustrated with their inability to tax U.S.-based tech companies, but the negotiations have moved slower than the minimum tax.</p><p>Currently, corporations pay taxes based in part on where they have a physical presence and where they generate profits. And in the digital age, that has become disconnected from the location of their consumers, to the frustration of European countries who see Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. and other U.S. tech companies profiting in their markets.</p><p>Key details of the talks cover which companies are included and excluded, how disputes between countries would get resolved and how to perform some calculations that determine how much in taxing rights would get reallocated.</p><p>\"We are one of 137 jurisdictions at the table, and there do remain a number of political and technical issues to be resolved,\" Michael Plowgian, a Treasury official working on the negotiations, said in a separate D.C. Bar panel.</p><p>Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.comand Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com</p><p>Yellen Seeks to Win European Support for a Tax Deal Congress Hasn't Approved</p>",
