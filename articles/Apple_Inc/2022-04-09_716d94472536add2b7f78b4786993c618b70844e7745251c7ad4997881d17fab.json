  "title": "U.S. News: Will Smith Banned From Oscars for 10 Years",
  "text": "<p>The organization also apologized for its handling of the matter during this year's show, which was on March 27.</p><p>\"During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,\" the statement read. \"This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short -- unprepared for the unprecedented.\"</p><p>The reprimand from the academy comes as a formal response to the incident on Oscar night, when Mr. Smith slapped Mr. Rock on stage and then yelled profane comments at him after the comedian made a joke at the expense of Mr. Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Soon after, Mr. Smith accepted his first Oscar, picking up the best actor prize for his performance in \"King Richard.\"</p><p>The academy didn't say the actor was disqualified from future Oscar nominations or wins, and it didn't revoke his trophy.</p><p>\"I accept and respect the Academy's decision,\" Mr. Smith said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>A representative for Mr. Rock didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Smith last week resigned from the academy. In a statement released last Friday, the 53-year-old actor called his actions \"shocking, painful and inexcusable.\" As an ex-member of the academy, Mr. Smith can no longer cast Oscar ballots.</p><p>The actor's statement a week ago included a long list of apologies, starting with Mr. Rock and his family and widening out to viewers who watched the Oscars around the world. Mr. Smith has apologized multiple times -- first to the academy and his fellow nominees in his Oscars speech, then to Mr. Rock in an Instagram post the next day, and then again his statement last Friday.</p><p>The academy's decision came faster than some awards watchers anticipated. The group had signaled it might not announce a decision until after a board meeting on April 18.</p><p>Starting this month and extending for the next decade, Mr. Smith can't attend any academy events either in person or virtually, according to the statement, \"including but not limited to the Academy Awards.\"</p><p>After celebrating his win on Oscar night, Mr. Smith woke up to a wave of criticism for his behavior at the awards show. What looked like one of the best moments in any actor's life quickly turned into the opposite as the controversy hit global news cycles.</p><p>Mr. Rock hasn't directly addressed the slap. The comedian, who is on tour, has told an audience that he was \"still kind of processing what happened.\"</p><p>On Friday, the academy expressed its \"deep gratitude\" for Mr. Rock's poise during the incident, as well as the behavior of others on the telecast.</p><p>Mr. Rock's joke concerned Ms. Pinkett Smith's hair. The actress has alopecia, a hair-loss condition that she has discussed publicly.</p><p>Mr. Smith's projects in development include \"Emancipation,\" an Apple Inc. drama based on the true story of a runaway slave who helped fuel an antislavery movement after the publication of photos of his whip-scarred back. Apple hasn't announced any change to a release date, which had been planned for late this year. Some Hollywood executives expected Mr. Smith's performance would put him back on the awards circuit next year.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
