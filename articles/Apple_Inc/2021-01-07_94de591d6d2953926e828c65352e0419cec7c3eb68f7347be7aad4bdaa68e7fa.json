  "text": "<p>Thank you for ending the year with an editorial that is aspirational (“A better form of capitalism is possible”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de643f89-5be8-4344-81ac-78c7026e9bfe\">FT View</a>, December 31). </p> <p>Perhaps the main handicap in our economy is short-termism. Corporations are weakened as sources for real growth, productivity and employment. As a result, our citizens could be left in a precariat.</p> <p>The short-termism leads to disinvestment, liquidation of needed assets and financialisation. It leaves behind debt and little more than a marketing shell, vulnerable to the next downturn. By contrast, Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Apple management or the Chinese know that what we need is real long-term investment. Stakeholder capitalism has been proposed. The problem is that, like making taxes voluntary, it could lead to chaos. </p> <p>A corporation can have large impacts, but our nation's founders knew that a territory can have only one sovereign power. They established corporate law as a way to create corporations. Production follows from many inputs: investors, employees, suppliers and infrastructure from the community. What we need is producer capitalism. Corporate boards should include a block representing investors, an equal block elected by employees, someone from the community, and a forensic accountant who specialises in corporate management. </p> <p><strong>Harry Thorn <br></strong><em>Philadelphia, PA, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Bezos, Apple and Beijing know what's necessary' FT.com 7 January.
