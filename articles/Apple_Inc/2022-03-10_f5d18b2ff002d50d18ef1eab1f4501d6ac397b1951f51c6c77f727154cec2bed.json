  "title": "'The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey' Review: A Mind Racing Against the Clock; Samuel L. Jackson stars as a man trying to solve the murder of his nephew before the special treatment that cures his dementia wears off",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>Which is apt, because the six-part series, created by novelist Walter Mosley and based on his 2010 book of the same name, is about memory itself, short-term and long-. The Ptolemy of the title, named for an Egyptian king, has fallen on the hardest of times: His dementia is so far gone he can barely function, his apartment is the definition of squalid. His days consist of canned beans, unfinished books (\"Sister Carrie\"), and the drone of TV news warring with Atlanta classical radio for his scant attention. Only the occasional visits of his nephew and lone human contact, Reggie (Omar Benson Miller), break up the routine, not that Ptolemy notices much. Of anything. \"Why is the alarm clock in the refrigerator?\" Reggie asks his uncle, who answers, \"I wanted to know what the temperature was.\" This is Chico Marx level humor, and the kind of line the masterly Mr. Mosley uses to calibrate the mood.</p><p>It's a mood that's otherwise frequently grim, whether the narrative is revisiting Ptolemy's traumatic childhood in Jim Crow Mississippi, or the perils of current-day Georgia. (The transformation of Mr. Jackson from wizened old man to Jim Brown in his prime is credited to the wizardry of makeup artist Jake Garber and hairstylist Camille Friend.) Reggie is about to get murdered. Ptolemy's care and feeding is going to fall, almost by accident, to 17-year-old Robyn (Dominique Fishback, \"Judas and the Black Messiah\"), who at first blush seems the last person who should be entrusted with this unpredictable and ungovernable old man. She is, instead, the perfect person.</p><p>How she becomes Ptolemy's caregiver, while important to the story, is less important to the series as a whole than the dynamic between Ms. Fishback and Mr. Jackson. Their pas de deux is a wonder all its own, something rare and exhilarating, an alchemical reaction of youth and experience, defiance and resignation, fragility and stone.</p><p>Which is which? Each actor inhabits the other's emotional universe. And throughout a show that has to take a breath now and then, just to collect itself and stay on track, they captivate. They might even take our minds off the cliffhanger opening of the series, which is, to say the least, enigmatic: Why do we meet Ptolemy cleanshaven and lucid, with a loaded revolver in his hand, vengeance on his lips and someone knocking threateningly at the door of his immaculate apartment? One certainly wants to find out.</p><p>\"Ptolemy Grey\" contains elements of \"Memento,\" \"Awakenings\" and mostly the novella \"Flowers for Algernon\" (and its movie adaptation, \"Charly\") in which medicine gives a mentally impaired man a short window of clarity and heightened perception. Likewise Ptolemy: Because he's so physically fit, his doctor recommends him as a candidate for an experimental study being done by a dementia specialist, Dr. Ruben (Walton Goggins), the catch being that it isn't permanent. If Ptolemy is going to solve Reggie's murder—and to find the treasure entrusted to him as a child by his long-ago friend Cordell (Damon Gupton, in flashbacks) and write an airtight will leaving all his money to Robyn rather than his parasitic family—he has to act fast.</p><p>Mr. Mosley works fast by instinct, experience and his singular gifts as a teller of briskly told tales (the Easy Rawlins novels, most famously), one who can braid disparate characters and parallel plotlines together while using his fiction to make statements of haunting profundity: Ptolemy's attitude toward Ruben's program reflects the well-founded, historical black mistrust of medical experiments. But the success of Ruben's program, as brief as it might be, raises its own issues: Is regaining one's mind only to know you're going to lose it ultimately cruel? And is dementia, as a form of amnesia, actually merciful, at least for someone with Ptolemy's memories—of lynchings, fires, an unfaithful wife (Cynthia Kaye McWilliams), friends long gone and justice denied? \"The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey\" may be a fantastic story. But it isn't any fairy tale.</p><p>'The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey' Review: A Mind Racing Against the Clock</p>",
