The tech giant was linked to a partnership with Hyundai, HYMTF but the&#xa0;deal got called off just a month after the story broke. Apple is reportedly still working on a fully electric vehicle, but little else is known — no surprise from the popular but secretive company.</p><p>Possible future EVs:&#xa0;</p><p>Apple Car</p><p>Aspark</p><p>Aspark is a car company based in Osaka, Japan, developing the fastest accelerating supercar.

The MX-30 features “freestyle doors” that swing out to open instead of opening like typical car doors. Despite the fancy doors and sleek design, the MX-30 offers a rather underwhelming 100 miles of range on a full charge.
