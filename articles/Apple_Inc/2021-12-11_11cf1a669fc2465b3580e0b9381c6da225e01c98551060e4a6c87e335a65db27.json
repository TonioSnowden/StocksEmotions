  "text": "<p>\n  In some of our country's most difficult moments, Americans have persevered to help heal our divides. \"Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington\" by Ted Widmer recounts Abraham Lincoln's harrowing 13-day journey from Illinois to D.C. as president-elect. There were the rigors of ongoing public appearances; the physical challenge of meeting hundreds of people a day with little planning or security; and the real, recurring threats to Lincoln's life and plots to undermine the election certification. All amid the reality of Southern secession. The book tells the story of Lincoln's personal development as a newly elected leader at a time when the country needed a giant. It also describes his intuitive understanding that personal humility was critical to rebuilding faith in a country supposed to be of, by and for the people. His willingness to reach out and listen to \"ordinary\" people made a difference, especially given that many of those he talked to had lost faith in what appeared to many to be a corrupt Washington. His leadership, his struggles and his belief in this democracy of ours still ring true today. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Hassan is a U.S. senator from New Hampshire. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Robert Iger </p><p>\n  My favorite read this year was \"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius\" by A. Scott Berg. Perkins had an extraordinary eye for fledgling talent, discovering and developing several of the 20th century's literary giants, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe. Recognizing their potential and the conceivable impact of their stories on society, Perkins fostered intimate and trusting relationships with his writers, providing critical perspective to sharpen their skills and draw out their best work, always keenly aware of the difference in roles between editor and author. Perkins also derived huge satisfaction from mentoring young talent, which strongly resonated with me. Among the most rewarding aspects of my career has been the opportunity to work with truly great generational talents, exceptional storytellers with a remarkable ability to entertain and inspire. By personally investing time and ensuring such gifted creators have the right support and resources, we empower them to tell extraordinary stories that can have a profound impact. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Iger is the former CEO of the Walt Disney Company and author of \"The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Honoree Fanonne Jeffers </p><p>\n  One of the worst legacies of American chattel slavery is the erasure of history: Those who were enslaved weren't considered important except as pieces of property, which means that there aren't extensive written records on African Americans in the pre-Civil War South. Yet a master historian can take seemingly small moments of the past and make us understand the much larger implications. In \"All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley's Sack, a Black Family Keepsake,\" renowned scholar Tiya Miles examines the intersections between material and human history by focusing on a burlap sack that was passed down through generations. This plain item wasn't worth any money but held immeasurable value to the African-American family who retained and cherished it. More than the story of the sack and the symbolic love it contained -- given by a devoted, enslaved mother whose child is about to be sold away from her -- Ms. Miles's book explains (with a light hand) the importance of historical memory, when some in this country still are intent upon erasing black lives. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Jeffers is the author, most recently, of \"The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois,\" a novel. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Diane Johnson </p><p>\n  This was my year for trying to make myself read more foreign literature. My only option in another language is French, so most recently I read French versions of Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz's \"The Passenger,\" originally published in German as \"Der Reisende,\" and Alberto Ongaro's \"La Partita,\" translated from Italian. The first recounts a day in the life of a Jewish businessman who tries to leave Germany in the immediate aftermath of Kristallnacht. The second takes place in 18th-century Venice, the time of Casanova and Don Giovanni and the other great roues of history. Strangely enough, both books concern the flight of the protagonist from relentless pursuers. Other than these works of fiction, I've been reading history, mostly centered around the Napoleonic wars, in the service of something I'm writing about a real person from that period, Edward \"Fighting\" Nicolls, a British military figure present at the Battle of New Orleans (1815). Nicolls was unusual for his time and profession, an abolitionist with sympathy for aboriginal people, whether in North America, New Zealand or the interesting-sounding places he governed, like the island of Fernando Po. Finally, for a tribute I was appointed to write about the late novelist Ward Just, I've had the pleasure of rereading some of his novels, especially \"Echo House,\" \"American Romantic\" and \"An Unfinished Season.\" </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Johnson is the author, most recently, of \"Lorna Mott Comes Home,\" a novel. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Keyshawn Johnson </p><p>\n  John Thompson was one of the greatest college basketball coaches in history, an unlikely man to build a championship team at Georgetown University during the glory days of the Big East. Why unlikely? Because Thompson grew up in the Washington, D.C., projects just a few miles from Georgetown, a place that seemed as far as the moon, as he put it in his autobiography, \"I Came as a Shadow.\" But Thompson, carrying the burden of expectation as one of the few black coaches in the sport, created a dynasty by recruiting and coaching players like Patrick Ewing, Allen Iverson, Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning. The book was finished just before he died on Aug. 30, 2020, and just after the racial unrest that rocked the country after the murder of George Floyd. Thompson was heartened by the outpouring of outrage over Floyd's killing, which reminded him that \"we should not accept the unacceptable.\" Thompson lived by those words throughout his career, and he brings us back to a time when he was raised in a deeply segregated society. He was called stupid -- and worse -- by his teachers because he couldn't read until the fifth grade. With the help of his parents and an influential teacher named Sametta Wallace Jackson, Thompson went on to earn a master's degree in counseling and guidance. He used his life experiences not only in building a winning program at Georgetown but in shaping the lives of young African-American men in the process. This is a man who stood by his principles and once protested against an NCAA requirement that would have negatively impacted black athletes by walking off the court before a game at the Capital Centre and refusing to coach. He single-handedly reversed that ruling. Thompson's book shows how complicated his life truly was, but also how he overcame many challenges to create a Hall of Fame legacy. You won't find a greater role model. I only wish he could have seen the impact of this book. Terrific read. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Johnson is the co-author of \"The Forgotten First: Kenny Washington, Woody Strode, Marion Motley, Bill Willis, and the Breaking of the NFL Color Barrier.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Roxana Jullapat </p><p>\n  My favorite read of 2021 was Mayukh Sen's \"Taste Makers: Seven Immigrant Women Who Revolutionized Food in America.\" Early in the book, the author sets his intention: \"Reading this book may warm your heart, but it should unsettle you at certain points, too. It should make you squirm.\" Indeed, it hit a nerve. Some of the subjects in this collection -- Marcella Hazan, Julie Sahni, Madeleine Kamman -- are no stranger to many of us, but this may be the first time we learn about Chao Yang Buwei, Elena Zelayeta, Najmieh Batmanglij and Norma Shirley. What these teachers, chefs and writers have in common is an unapologetic impulse to cook food that truly represents who they are and where they come from, without having to temper it to appeal to the American palate. \"Taste Makers\" made me wish for a time machine so I could rewind to when I was a young cook and find in any of them, all of them, my role models and mentors. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Jullapat is the owner of Friends &amp; Family bakery in Los Angeles and the author of \"Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Michio Kaku </p><p>\n  Perhaps the greatest science-fiction saga of all time, Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series is creating waves once again. This multi-volume series predicts the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire, and chronicles the heroic exploits of a band of mathematician-engineers devoted to minimizing the chaos and destruction caused by its inevitable collapse. This year, something once considered too ambitious became a reality, as \"Foundation\" was transformed into an Apple TV+ series. Elon Musk has said that the original series, which he read as a child, shaped his vision for the future of humanity as a multiplanet species. The books forced me to change my own outlook on physics. As a child, \"Foundation\" showed me an era 50,000 years in the future, when the known laws of physics, quantum theory and relativity may have to be radically modified. I had to consider the possibility that an entirely new physics might arise out of the ashes of the old. This, in part, has inspired me to work on string theory, which could make possible some of the imaginative space-time devices found in science fiction. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is the author of \"The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Raymond Kethledge </p><p></p>",
