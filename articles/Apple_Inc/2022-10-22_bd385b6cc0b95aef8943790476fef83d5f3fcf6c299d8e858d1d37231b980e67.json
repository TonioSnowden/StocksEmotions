  "text": "<p>Napa Valley winemaker Samantha Sheehan showcases different citrus each season in her line of vermouths, called Mommenpop. This fall it's kumquats, from a farm in Escondido, Calif. \"I'm not trying to make a vermouth that tastes like France or Italy, but one that tastes uniquely of California,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Sheehan rounds out the sharp fruit with succulent persimmons and warm fig leaves (3,000 of which she dried on sheet pans in the oven), as well as green walnuts, galangal and orris root. She makes the Chardonnay base herself and fortifies it with a spirit made from her wine at a nearby distillery. \"The thing I love about kumquats is they have that tangy pop,\" she said. The vermouth makes a welcome addition to cool-weather spritzes and is a satisfying cocktail on its own, over ice.</p><p>If Mommenpop reflects sunny California, Rachael Petach's C. Cassis speaks to the cool northeast. Ms. Petach produces it in New York's Hudson Valley, sourcing most of the fruit from a 50-acre farm run by Greg Quinn, the person responsible for bringing blackcurrants back to New York state after a century-long ban due to a fungus the fruit fostered. She's hopeful that even more blackcurrants are on the way, as Propagate Ventures, part of a national agroforestry initiative, works to expand Hudson Valley plantings.</p><p>Ms. Petach macerates the blackcurrants with rosé wine, and infuses the combination with lemon verbena, bay leaf and other botanicals to make something vivid and nuanced, a far cry from France's syrupy crème de cassis. Last year, she aged a small portion for 6 months in an old bourbon barrel from Hudson Valley Distillers. \"The barrel brings out a savory salinity,\" Ms. Petach said. She uses the barrel-aged bottling in a variation on a Manhattan she calls the Silver Fox, with sweet vermouth and walnut liqueur.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Wilczak gets his apples from orchards owned by King Charles himself, planted to 1,000 different varieties. Each bottling is distilled three times, unveiling the essence not only of a tree but of a place, its history and a particular season, worth pausing to savor now.</p><p>THE RIPE STUFF</p><p>Fallish bottles for sipping and mixing </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>1. Neversink Spirits Apple Aperitif</p><p>Inspired by pommeau from Normandy, Yoni Rabino and Noah Braunstein make this juicy drink from fresh apple cider blended with their own apple brandy made from New York apples. It's beautiful with soda or in cocktails with warming spices. $47 for 750 ml</p><p>2. Capreolus Damson Plum Eau de Vie</p><p>Damson plums have been grown in England's Cotswolds for some 1800 years. Distilled, the mouth-puckering damson opens up to reveal fine floral and red-berry flavors. Made in very limited supply, this is meant to be sipped on its own. $219 for 375 ml</p><p>3. Apologue Pawpaw</p><p>The Apologue distillery, outside Chicago, purchased 250 pounds of non-GMO pawpaws—which are curiously mango-like and tropical for fruits that grow in the temperate north—from a farm in Athens County, Ohio. The resulting tangy liqueur finds its best expression as the sweet component in cocktails. $46 for 750 ml</p><p>4. C. Cassis Barrel Aged Blackcurrant Liqueur</p><p>Most crème de cassis from France is made with a heavy dose of sugar; the Hudson Valley's C. Cassis is not. Sweetened with local honey, this barrel-aged bottling takes on a burnt-sugar note with time in oak. Bright, herbaceous, cold-weather-perfect. $42 for 375 ml</p><p>5. Mommenpop Peak Season Kumquat Aperitif</p><p>The product of 1,200 pounds of kumquats, 800 pounds of persimmons and 3,000 toasted fig leaves, this autumnal apéritif gets an edge from galangal, quassia, cardamom and orris root. $38 for 750 ml</p><p>The Most Delicious Fall Drinks</p>",
