  "title": "Houses of Worship:  The Christian Heart of Hong Kong Activism  ----  By Dan Hitchens",
  "text": "<p>    Joseph Cheng, 71, used to be one of Hong Kong's busiest activists: a familiar presence in the media and a leading figure in several pro-democracy organizations. After retiring in 2015, the former political-science professor planned to live out his remaining days in the city. But Mr. Cheng's life -- a microcosm of Hong Kong's recent history -- has been turned upside down. </p><p>   Last year's so-called national-security law reclassified much ordinary activism as a criminal offense. On April 10, two days after I spoke to Mr. Cheng, authorities handed down sentences for campaigners including the media tycoon Jimmy Lai (14 months in prison) and the \"father of Hong Kong democracy,\" Martin Lee (a suspended sentence). Since then, the arrests have continued and Mr. Lai's newspaper Apple Daily has been shut down. </p><p>   Fearing prosecution, Mr. Cheng and his wife moved to Canberra, Australia, in July 2020. \"It's a quiet life,\" he tells me. \"Sometimes it's a little bit lonely.\" Because of Covid, his family members in Hong Kong can't visit. \"You feel bad to see friends arrested, prosecuted, sentenced to prison. But I understand that there is very little I can do.\" </p><p>   Mr. Cheng was born in 1949 to Chinese parents who had fled the civil war. He has, in turn, held the British colonial government to account as a leading member of the pressure group Hong Kong Observers; campaigned for political reform under Chinese rule; and now finds himself in de facto exile. He is also a practicing Catholic, and his career is a reminder of the remarkably strong Christian influence on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. </p><p>   Only 12% of Hong Kongers are Christians, but they play an outsize role. Messrs. Lai and Lee, the most prominent of the activists sentenced in April, are Catholics. Benny Tai, initiator of the 2013-14 Occupy Central campaign, is a Protestant who held one of the movement's early press conferences at a church. Christian leaders like Cardinal Joseph Zen and the Baptist minister Chu Yiu-Ming have been at the forefront of the cause. One of the most frequently heard protest songs has been \"Sing Hallelujah to the Lord.\" </p><p>   Religion has also helped to bridge the generational gap between the sober, consensual style of older figures like Messrs. Lee and Cheng and megaphone-wielding, social-media-savvy student leaders like Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow. The last two, currently serving jail terms, have cited Christianity as an influence. \"He is always being criticized by the Communist Party for advocating human rights,\" Ms. Chow said of Mr. Cheng in 2019. \"He is brilliant and really a very influential figure for many of the Catholics in Hong Kong or even all Christians.\" </p><p>   Was Mr. Cheng surprised to see himself described like that? He chuckles. \"I dare not say so!\" But he acknowledges that his public life has been partly inspired by \"the Confucian model of an intellectual: that he should be the conscience of the people.\" At the same time, he is \"very much a product of Catholic education.\" Eleven years at church schools taught him the importance of \"seeking justice\" and \"empathy with ordinary people.\" </p><p>   One legacy of colonialism, Mr. Cheng observes, was a large role for Christian education. \"The top executives, the top civil servants, many of them have come from church schools.\" That experience shaped many members of Hong Kong's elite -- including those who have stood up to the authorities. </p><p>   Church schools also educated many of Hong Kong's social workers, who from the 1970s onward have led campaigns for workers' rights and fair treatment of migrants, among other issues. These Christian leaders, Mr. Cheng says, learned the arts of organizing grassroots movements, mounting protests, catching the media's eye. Their skills, more recently applied to the pro-democracy cause, may explain the sheer scale of the 2019 demonstrations, which sometimes numbered more than a quarter of the population. </p><p>   Mr. Cheng believes Christians' affinity for activism is natural. \"You are ready to suffer in this life, and you seek a much more meaningful afterlife,\" he says. That contrasts with an attitude sometimes found in Hong Kong: \"'Keep your head low, just concentrate on making money, don't bother with other things. Avoid politics, that'll only get you into trouble.' The Christians, by their natural values, have a tendency to downgrade worldly goods at least a bit.\" </p><p>   Despite its recent defeats, Mr. Cheng believes the pro-democracy movement has fostered \"a very strong sense of defiance,\" which could well re-emerge in some new form. In Canberra, meanwhile, he is at work on his memoirs. There may be a few more twists before the final chapter can be written. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Hitchens writes the Pineapple newsletter. </p><p></p>",
