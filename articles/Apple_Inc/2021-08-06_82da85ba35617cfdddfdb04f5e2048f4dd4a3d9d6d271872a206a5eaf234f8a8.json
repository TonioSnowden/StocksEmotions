  "title": "Arts in Review -- Television Review: 'Mr. Corman': Facing Life's Lessons --- Joseph Gordon-Levitt directs and stars as a dissatisfied fifth-grade teacher and aspiring composer",
  "text": "<p>Billed though it is as comedy-drama, it's clear from the start of \"Mr. Corman\" (begins Friday, Apple TV+) that the laughs in this 10-episode series will be few but the smiles of recognition frequent. It's a testament to the complex charms of this series that those smiles are as often summoned by bleak moments as happier ones. Some of the most engaging aspects of this tale derive from the problems that arise when its hero, Josh Corman (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is also the show's creator, producer and director), undertakes efforts to pursue women -- situations that yield some of the most hilarious moments. They're moments made still more enticing by the flow of pure venom that follows when characters' plans go awry. Things can go wrong on dates, everyone knows -- some of them the most intimate kind of going wrong. And in the world \"Mr. Corman\" describes, there's not a lot of gracious forgiveness to spare at such times.</p><p>It's all to the good to see animal passions emerge, however irregularly, in a character like Josh, who is, it's quickly established, a schoolteacher -- clue No. 1 that he shouldn't be seen as the happiest of men, or anything like a proudly assertive one. By his own inner lights, he's not very successful either. It's a point made more than once.</p><p>One woman fancying that he insulted her, and moved thus to express her rage, hurls the message out clearly: If he's teaching it's because he knows there's nothing else he can do. You can feel his silent flinch. The truth is there is something else he can do, and he wants desperately to do it -- only it doesn't come with a salary. The real love of his life, deep and abiding, has nothing to do with teaching: it's making music, composing it.</p><p>Still, every weekday Josh faces his classroom of fifth-grade students with full devotion to his task, and a certain affection for his charges, who sometimes ponder large questions. Does good luck matter more than talent? They have opinions on such matters.</p><p>But living has now been rendered difficult for Josh by a strange, new and extreme uneasiness that seems to grow daily, something far harder to endure than ordinary anxiety. This new discomfort, bordering on the unbearable, is enough to drive him to call a doctor. But, as one might expect in a saga of this kind, the only doctor he knows won't be available for two months.</p><p>Everyone will recognize the panic in him as he tries -- while imagining he's dying -- to answer the questions about his identity that his doctor's office keeps asking. And what if he reads the numbers on his insurance card wrong?</p><p>It's at such dramatic junctures that performance skills shine -- or not. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt's perfect rendering of the torments of a full-scale panic attack merits all accolades that come to mind. Including, of course, \"breathtaking.\"</p><p>Josh's family members know nothing of his anxieties. He cherishes his close connection with his widowed mother, Ruth (a highly persuasive Debra Winger) -- though Ruth has now taken up with a man her son detests, not least because Josh immediately recognizes in him the sort of mate his mother tends to pick: the kind, as Josh puts it, who makes her feel bad about herself. His mother, in turn, isn't given to filtering her views of her son. She's also the quintessential pragmatist about what a person needs in life -- a woman person, in particular.</p><p>\"You don't do well when other people are happy,\" she informs Josh, with the zest of an explorer reporting a significant discovery. Josh, for his part, doesn't think much of his sister, Beth, whom he describes as a \"control freak.\" The script provides many a suggestion that this insult derives from Josh's scorn for her religious beliefs. He's soon embroiled in a dangerous discussion about God's existence, which leaves Josh accused of having poisoned the mind of Beth's young daughter with the idea that God isn't real.</p><p>The solidly entertaining \"Mr. Corman\" progresses to the Covid-19 pandemic, schoolchildren's lessons are transmitted via computer, and along the way Josh's life is radically transformed, in ways we can leave the show to reveal.</p>",
