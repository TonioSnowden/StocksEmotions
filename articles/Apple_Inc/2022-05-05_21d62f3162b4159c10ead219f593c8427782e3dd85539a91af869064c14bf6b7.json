  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>Glenn Close joins the new season of Emmy-winning \"Tehran,\" which begins streaming this week, as a renowned psychiatrist who lives in Iran and spies for Israel.</p><p>The thriller follows Tamar Rabinyan (Niv Sultan), an agent with Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, who is tasked with assassinating the new head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Faraz Kamaali (Shaun Toub), the former head of investigations for the Guard, is hunting her down. Both rely on the support of Ms. Close's Marjan Montazemi.</p><p>To prepare for the role Ms. Close devoured books that plumbed the history of the region, and she studied Farsi for several months. On set, she worked with a language coach who is a refugee from Iran. Members of the crew treated her to a Shabbat dinner.</p><p>\"I don't like to go over territory—emotional and psychological—that I feel I've explored before,\" she said in a Zoom interview from her home in Montana. \"The thing that I loved about 'Tehran' was that it was totally out of my comfort zone. It was totally different from anything I'd ever done before the character.\"</p><p>The second season of \"Tehran\" premieres Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>New Release: 'Bosch: Legacy'</p><p>(Freevee, formerly known as IMDb TV)</p><p>\"Bosch,\" Prime Video's longest-running series about LAPD detective Harry Bosch, gets a spin-off this week with \"Bosch: Legacy.\" Like the original, which wrapped its seventh and final season last year, \"Legacy\" is based on the Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly and stars Titus Welliver in the title role.</p><p>The new series finds Harry Bosch out of the LAPD and working as a private investigator. He's hired to find out if an aging billionaire has an heir. The first season of \"Legacy\" is loosely based on Mr. Connelly's 2016 novel, \"The Wrong Side of Goodbye.\"</p><p>Mr. Connelly, who writes for and executive-produces the show, says that while there are familiar characters and stories in the new series, the creators wanted it to stand on its own. Among other changes, writers elevated the roles of attorney Money Chandler (Mimi Rogers) and Bosch's daughter, Maddie (Madison Lintz), now a rookie cop in the LAPD.</p><p>Focusing on Maddie's character allowed them to address how policing has changed since 2016, Mr. Connelly says. \"We do have a sense of duty to tell stories realistically,\" he says, \"and you can't do that without taking in these aspects of society and community.\"</p><p>If the spin-off isn't enough Bosch for you, there's also a world of audiobooks, also starring Mr. Welliver. Titles available include \"The Black Echo,\" Mr. Connelly's first Harry Bosch novel; \"The Burning Room,\" the basis for the last season of \"Bosch;\" and \"The Wrong Side of Goodbye,\" the inspiration for the first season of \"Bosch: Legacy.\" Titles are available on Amazon, Apple Books and other retailers.</p><p>\"Bosch: Legacy\" premieres Friday on Freevee, Amazon's free, ad-supported streaming service, which, until recently, was known as IMDb TV. All seven seasons of \"Bosch\" are now available on Freevee.</p><p>STREAMING NOTES:</p><p>— The Return of Mike Myers: Mike Myers returns to the small screen this week with \"The Pentaverate,\" a new series that he created for Netflix.
