  "text": "<p>Mr. Malanga suggests unions should have a problem with this, but I've found the opposite. Six of New York's most politically influential unions -- representing everyone from hotel workers to nurses to janitors -- back my campaign. And we were recently endorsed by the New York City Central Labor Council, representing the full diversity of New York's unionized working class. When unions and DSA come together, workers win.</p><p>Mr. Malanga is eager to give unions political advice, but he's against prevailing-wage laws and the union shop. Socialists want union membership to expand, and workers to have political power. Mr. Malanga has the right to disagree, but for many of my supporters, it's more of the same divisive rhetoric.</p><p>Alexa Aviles</p><p>Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>",
