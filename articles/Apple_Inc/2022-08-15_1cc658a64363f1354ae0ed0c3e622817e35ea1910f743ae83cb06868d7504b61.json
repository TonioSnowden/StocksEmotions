  "title": "How to Make Your Old Phone Last Longer",
  "text": "<p>Phones are more durable. Their larger batteries provide longer life for more years, and the display glass is stronger, too. Unless you want to jump to folding phones -- which we don't yet recommend -- a new model will feel incremental at best.</p><p>The market reflects this. With the exception of $900-and-up models, phone sales are down, especially in the past four quarters, according to analytics firm IDC.</p><p>If your phone is less than five years old and still kicking, you can improve its speed and extend its longevity with this four-step program.</p><p>Step 1: Check software compatibility</p><p>Fall is my favorite time of year, not because of new phones but because it's when the latest versions of Apple's iOS and Google's Android software ship. These updates can make old devices feel new again, and come with critical security and bug fixes. Only use phones supported by the most recent software, and consider an upgrade (or a recent-model refurbished) if not.</p><p>iPhone: Currently, the iPhone 6S (released in 2015) and newer are supported by the latest iOS, 15.6. However, iOS 16, due this September, will drop support for older models. Only the iPhone 8 (released in 2017) and newer will get it.</p><p>Android: System and security updates are separate. Check and update your Android version in the settings app. The exact flow differs by manufacturer.</p><p>Step 2: Assess your charging habits</p><p>If you have a damaged or frayed cable, replace it. Charging gear endures a lot of stress, and getting a new setup can charge your device more efficiently and safely. Consider upgrading to a braided nylon cable or, if your device supports it, a wireless charger.</p><p>Lithium-ion batteries -- the kind in your phone and most other electronics -- decay over time, and the way you charge or use the battery can speed up that decay. Repeatedly charging your battery to 100% or using your phone below 15% isn't good for your battery's health, says Skyler Allenolson, a technician at the on-demand tech-support service Nerd App. Many phones now have settings to monitor and improve battery life.</p><p>iPhone: Go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health, then enable Optimized Battery Charging to reduce battery aging.</p><p>Samsung: Go to Settings &gt; Device Care &gt; Optimize Now. Galaxy Phones have a \"Protect Battery\" option, which limits the charge to 85%. Go to Settings &gt; Battery and Device Care &gt; Battery &gt; More Battery Settings &gt; Protect Battery to enable. Just remember, with this setting, you'll extend your battery's lifespan, but you'll have shorter battery life after each charge.</p><p>Step 3: Boost your speed</p><p>Sluggish devices might be the result of older batteries. Typically, batteries will start to see decreased performance after two or three years, or about 500 charge cycles. Getting a replacement once your battery health percentage drops below 80% of its original capacity could increase performance.</p><p>iPhone: Go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health to see your battery's capacity.</p><p>Android: There isn't a readily accessible built-in feature, but apps such as AccuBattery and MacroPinch show insights into your device's battery health.</p><p>These tips from Mr. Allenolson can also improve performance:</p><p>Restart your phone every other day. \"Leaving a phone on for an extended period can cause a build up of unusable memory and errors,\" he said.</p><p>Free up space. Think of your phone like an office, Mr. Allenolson said. When it gets crammed with stuff, it's harder to move around. See what's hogging storage in iPhone or Android settings. Delete unnecessary media or use a photo cloud service that automatically removes locally stored images once they're backed up.</p><p>Prevent apps from running in the background. Too many running apps is a common culprit, Mr. Allenolson said. Turn off background app refresh in iOS or Android.</p><p>Use websites instead of apps. Apps not only take up space, but they can also run in the background, which can clog performance, he said.</p><p>Step 4: Protect your investment</p><p>A solid, grippy case with raised edges can add years to your phone's lifespan. I like Speck's cases because they're protective without adding too much bulk and Otterbox's screen protectors for their touch responsiveness. A phone holder, such as the PopGrip Slide, can also make your device easier to grip, and prevent falls.</p><p>And while many phones are protected from short exposure to water, don't take them snorkeling. \"Water-resistant is not the same as waterproof,\" said Mr. Allenolson, who emphasizes that moisture can still damage sensitive components.</p>",
