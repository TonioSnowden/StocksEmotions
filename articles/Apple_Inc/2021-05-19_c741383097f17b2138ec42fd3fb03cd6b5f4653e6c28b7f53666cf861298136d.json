  "text": "<p>Antonio García Martínez uprooted his life to take a job at Apple, moving from a home he'd built himself and giving up a&#xa0;public&#xa0;media presence he had cultivated over several years. But last Wednesday, less than four weeks after being hired, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation\">he was fired</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>His dismissal was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/apple-says-ads-engineer-leaves-company-after-comments-draw-fire\">justified by the company</a> on the grounds that “behaviour that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here”. The statement didn't cite any such behaviour at Apple, nor at any previous employer; Martínez, who said it implied there was some negative behaviour by him at Apple, has called it “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/1393335063480131585\">defamatory and categorically false</a>”. Rather, this was about parts of the&#xa0;bestselling <em>Chaos Monkeys</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d1cd50-4aa5-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c\">humorous memoir</a> of Martínez's time at Facebook written five years ago. A<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook\"> petition</a> signed by more than 2,000 Apple employees in the run-up to his dismissal alleged it contained “misogynistic statements”. </p> <p>In the passage that appears to have caused most offence, Martínez describes a rather formidable woman he was in love with, and compares her with “most women in the Bay Area”, who are “soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit”. </p> <p>This doesn't offend me — to be honest, I find it quite funny. I don't read “most women” as a literal or quantitative analysis of the female sex in a certain geographical area, but as a general comment on Silicon Valley culture, hammed up as part of the “Hunter S. Thompson mode” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript\">Mart</a>í<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript\">nez has described writing in</a>. I can see how it might offend some people and I think the use of the word “most” was a mistake — but so does Martínez, who tells me he regrets some of the passages in the book, and says that his character in the work was a “literary persona”. </p> <p>What I struggle to see is how his words could make for an “unsafe working environment” or inflict “public harassment&#xa0;and private bullying” on colleagues, as the petition suggested. Martínez says he has not been accused of either of these things. I also wonder why Apple — which was certainly aware of the book and had even asked some of Martínez's referees about it — hadn't previously considered its contents a problem.</p> <p>Raking over works of literary non-fiction and deeming parts of them beyond the pale could have a chilling effect on anyone in the corporate world thinking of writing an exposé of what happens there. As Bruno Maçães, former Portuguese minister of European Affairs and author of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0f95ce6-fab1-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a\"><em>The Dawn of Eurasia</em></a> tells me: “Apparently you can't write books and have a normal job any more . . . Are novelists going to be accused of having certain characters in the books that are not ‘good characters'?”</p> <p>Apple's response is also inconsistent. In 2014 the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ebce752-e6a3-11e3-9a20-00144feabdc0\">paid $3bn</a> to buy hip hop mogul Dr Dre's Beats Electronics — an acquisition that has proven <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/don-reisinger/apple-continues-to-prove-acquisition-of-beats-was-one-of-its-best-ever.html\">very profitable</a> — with Dre given <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics/\">an unspecified role</a> at the company as part of the deal. I am a big fan of Dre's music, and don't feel song lyrics should be evaluated on the basis of their moral righteousness. But it is worth pointing out that his songs include such titles as “Bitches ain't Shit”, and that he has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/dr-dres-abuse-women-dee-barnes-straight-outta-compton/401744/\">a history of actual violence</a> against women. </p> <p>Dre has apologised for his mistakes and, like Martínez, has “said that he's not the same person that he was”, according to Apple's own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/21/dr-dre-apologizes-dee-barnes-michelle-straight-outta-compton\">statement</a> on the matter back in 2015. So why does the company not show the same level of understanding towards Martínez? </p> <p>The irony that a Cuban-American has been castigated by a culture that apparently prioritises the emotional safety of minorities is not lost on Martínez: “I'm actually one of the few ‘people of colour' in tech that I know of who's risen to this level, and I'm getting shot down by white people who went to a fancy school! It's just incredible.” </p> <p>The affair is a reminder of the extent to which virtue-signalling social activism is seeping into corporate culture. It also highlights its disingenuousness — this seems to be about protecting Apple's brand and bottom line, not its employees. In a statement on the dismissal, Apple said it “always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted”. Or, it seems, everyone except those deemed to have committed word crime. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jemima.kelly@ft.com\"><em>jemima.kelly@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Jemima Kelly 2021 'What happens when virtue-signalling enters corporate life' FT.com 19 May.
