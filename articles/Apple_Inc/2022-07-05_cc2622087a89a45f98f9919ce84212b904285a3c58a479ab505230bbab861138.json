  "title": "Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds; Electric vehicles performed worse than gas-powered models in the J.D. Power quality study, with 240 complaints per 100 vehicles on average",
  "text": "<p>The study, in its 36th year, asks new car owners to report problems with their vehicles in the first 90 days of ownership. The numbers had been trending down in recent years. Last year, the industry average was 162 owner complaints per 100 vehicles. In 2020, that figure was 166.</p><p>This year, it was 180.</p><p>See: While car prices keep going up, these two electric cars just got a big price cut</p><p>An outlier thanks to a bad year, or a sign of things to come?</p><p>On the one hand, the number may show that 2022 is an outlier. Over the past year, vehicle factories have faced COVID-19-related factory shutdowns, repeated supply chain problems, and a global microchip shortage, causing automakers to add and delete features on the fly to keep the lines moving.</p><p>On the other, it may be a sign of an industry-wide problem. Every engineer knows that more complex machines have more possible failure points. Today's cars keep growing more complex.</p><p>Infotainment systems caused more complaints than any other feature. The most common complaint? Trouble connecting to Apple AAPL Carplay or Android Auto.</p><p>Adding weight to the complexity argument, buyers of feature-heavy luxury cars reported 196 problems per 100 vehicles on average. Buyers of mass-market brands reported 175.</p><p>Don't miss: How much more gas is costing for every type of vehicle — see how yours stacks up</p><p>Most brands slipped</p><p>Twenty-five of 33 brands studied saw their scores grow worse this year. General Motors' GM quality control team seems to have done the best job of weathering the many crises of 2022. All four of its U.S. brands – Buick, Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac – improved their scores from 2021. BMW XE:BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, and Audi also saw improvement.</p><p>Every other automaker had more problems reported in 2022 than in 2021, according to the report.</p><p>Read: Gasoline prices have fallen, but probably haven't peaked yet</p><p>EVs reported more problems</p><p>Electric vehicles performed worse than gas-powered models in the study. EVs had 240 complaints per 100 vehicles on average, plug-in hybrid vehicles had 239, and gas-powered cars averaged 175.</p><p>Those numbers are complicated by the fact that Tesla TSLA vehicles weren't counted in the study. Fully 75% of the EVs sold in the U.S. last quarter were Tesla products.</p><p>Several states require automakers to consent before J.D. Power can use their data. Tesla chose not to participate. J.D. Power published unofficial figures based on the data from states that don't require automaker consent but didn't rank the brand because the data was incomplete.</p><p>The rankings: </p><p> Ranking   Brand              Problems per 100 vehicles  1         Buick              139  2         Dodge              143  3         Chevrolet          147  4         Genesis            156  5         Kia KR:000270      156  6         Lexus              157  7         GMC                162  8         Cadillac           163  9         BMW                165  10        Ford F             167  11        Lincoln            167  12        Nissan NSANY       167  13        MINI               168  14        Toyota TM          172  15        Mazda MZDAY        180  16        Honda HMC          183  17        Hyundai HYMTF      185  18        Ram                186  19        Mercedes-Benz      189  20        Subaru FUJHY       191  21        Acura              192  22        Land Rover         193  23        Jeep               199  24        Porsche POAHY      200  25        Infiniti           204  26        Jaguar             210  27        Alfa Romeo         211  28        Mitsubishi MSBHF   226  29        Volkswagen VWAGY   230  30        Audi               239  31        Maserati           255  32        Volvo VLVLY        256  33        Chrysler           265</p><p>*Tesla did not provide complete data.
