  "title": "The Pig in the South Downs: rural bliss, 50 miles from London",
  "text": "<p>Hampshire was the first to fall, in 2011. Three years later, Somerset succumbed. Then Dorset, Devon, Kent, Cornwall and, as of this week, West Sussex. Now the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5665624-26a7-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025\">Pig hotel group</a> has, as its publicity puts it, “a trotter-hold in every south coast county of England” — a mini-empire of shabby-chic, sustainably sourced hospitality.&#xa0;</p> <p>That it has not grown even faster says a lot about the rigours of the “restaurants with rooms” formula established by hoteliers Robin Hutson — co-founder of the similarly successful Hotel du Vin chain — and David Elton 10 years ago. A pretty, rural location is not enough: a Pig also requires a kitchen garden big enough to supply produce year round, and a property able to accommodate enough guests to make a profit. The surrounding area needs to be both rural and entrepreneurial enough to supply all the food the garden can't from within a 25-mile radius.</p> <p>Above all, the property needs to have charm, or at least the potential for it. It needs weathered brick, gnarled trees and lichen on the stonework, but none of the decrepitude that often goes with such features. In short, it needs character, possibly even a dash of eccentricity, but not enough to amount to dysfunction. If a Pig was a person, it would be a bohemian great-uncle with whom you can spend a convivial weekend, yet is scrupulous about sell-by dates.</p> <p>The newest property, the “Pig in the South Downs” as the group has it, is in the tiny Sussex village of Madehurst, and it ticks all the boxes. An 18th-century house with extensive outbuildings, it sits at about the midpoint of the South Downs National Park, an area of chalk hills, farmland and woods that stretches for 80 miles or so. The hotel, converted from a private house, has mature trees, a generous lawn dotted with loungers, and not just a large kitchen garden — about an acre — but also a newly planted vineyard. In the game of locavore one-upmanship, this is a trump card.</p> <p>And although it is only about two hours from London, it feels secluded. As my wife and I drive there, the teeming A-roads and motorways that connect the capital to Sussex taper to a narrow, bumpy lane overarched with trees. It is as if we were burrowing into the countryside. When the sign bearing the golden pig appears, it looks bracingly new.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the car parked, we crunch along the gravel past a yew-shaded lawn decorated with stone spheres and a bronze resin pig to reception. Since we are early, our room is not ready yet, so, gin and tonic in hand, we explore the lounge and dining room.&#xa0;</p> <p>Judy Hutson, wife of co-founder Robin, designs the Pig interiors, and her signature blend of bold colours and mismatching gets full play here: the reception area is painted a deep sage green and the decor includes two glass cases of taxidermied seabirds, an ancient croquet set and a terracotta goddess. The chairs in the conservatory-cum-dining room do not match and nor do the parasols on the terrace. Tables are decorated with terracotta pots containing thyme and creeping savory, with neatly handwritten labels. Plastic pots would be an affront.</p> <p>I am very taken with it, though it is arguably a little precious. A bit of dust would skew the vibe disastrously towards grandma's attic, and the apparent casualness is the product of a lot of work: the new Pig has cost some £14m and employs about 100 staff.</p> <p>The quirky notes continue in our room, which is in a repurposed storage space behind the main house. It is reached via a courtyard planted with bulbous old olive trees, camellias, bay trees and herbs, and whose walls are a mix of ancient brick and knapped flint; a worn sandstone block among them bears the date 1661. </p> <p>Inside, the layout resembles a piece in a tessellation puzzle, with a sort of truncated corridor jutting away from the main sleeping area. The floor is of immaculately fitted timber, there's an antique desk with barley-twist legs, and a huge standalone bath in an avocado colour — a transgressive statement for people of my generation, who, raised in the dreary 1970s, learnt to deride its style choices.</p> <p>The bedside telephone (also avocado) has a dial, of course: it is possible that some younger customers will need to be shown how to use it. “We may be getting older,” I say to my wife, “but at least we've learnt a trick or two.” She remarks that, as life skills go, this one is of limited applicability.</p> <p>Ours is not the only room to be apart from the main house: clever use of outbuildings is something the Pigs specialise in. Only five of the 28 rooms here, in fact, are in the house, and wandering around the grounds is like exploring a miniature village, albeit one with a communal taste for Adirondack chairs of reclaimed wood and planters made from old water tanks. There are also a number of “Garden Wagons”, moveable timber huts with log-burner stoves and freestanding baths — catnip for anyone who subscribes to both Practical Caravan and The World of Interiors.</p> <p>As an allotment holder with a disastrous laissez-faire streak — so that interesting weeds constantly menace my paltry crops — I am drawn to the kitchen garden, and it is a predictably humbling experience, with plot after plot of vigorous brassicas, courgettes, French beans, leeks, salsify, gooseberries, you name it . . . The knotty, moss-grown apple trees are thick with fruit and there is even a mushroom house: peering in at the window, you can see hanging bags of growing medium with grey-blue trumpets of fungus curving up from the sides.&#xa0;</p> <p>It all pays off handsomely at mealtimes. At breakfast, I fall for the smashed peas and poached eggs on toast — food-mile-laden avocados are as much of a no-no as avocado bathroom suites used to be. Later on, braised lamb shoulder from the nearby Goodwood estate is rich and succulent, while figs from the garden, steeped in honey and rosemary, are intensely sweet. The wine list draws heavily on local vintages: as the climate warms, southern England is becoming ever more hospitable to viticulture and Sussex, with its chalky soil and gently rolling slopes, is a prime spot.</p> <p>Given more time, I would happily devote most of my visit to lounging in an Adirondack chair with a glass of local sparkling wine to hand but we are so close to Arundel that a visit is inevitable. It is a pleasant place in itself (any town with a well-stocked second-hand bookshop in its centre is all right by me) but the big draw is the castle, which dates back to the 11th century. </p> <p>This is a doubly incongruous building, both because it is the seat of the dukes of Norfolk, a county more than 100 miles away, and because it looks so ridiculously big. It's not that I expect a peer of the realm to cower in a bungalow, but it looms over the town and the surrounding flatlands as if carelessly Photoshopped in.&#xa0;</p> <p>The interiors, restored heavily in the 19th century, are a feast of Victorian Gothic, the great hall especially a magnificent space, with hammerbeam roof and twin fireplaces whose soaring stone hoods are out of all proportion to their hearths. Haughty worthies and pale beauties gaze down from the walls at richly carved furniture and glittering display cases, as well as at two forlorn-looking lion skins, whose taxidermied roars make the poor beasts look as if they are on an eternal trip to the dentist.</p> <p>Armed with a freshly purchased map, and eager to offset the efforts of the Pig's cooks, I elect to walk back. This involves steadily ascending the Downs, from a busy roundabout on the outskirts of town, along dusty bridleways and footpaths and into cool beech and yew woods. Alongside are fields of stubble whose flowing contours look as if they have been planed into shape, and into which panicked pheasants spring as I approach, their wings a battering whirr. In places the path is overgrown, with brambles slyly snagging my feet beneath the long grass, but the bigger problem is the profusion of forks and crossways. In the end I resort to Google Maps on my phone, which feels like cheating.</p> <p>Finally, after 90 minutes or so, the path emerges in Madehurst near the parish church, a low-towered old flint building set amid overgrown gravestones. I try the door, and am glad that I did, because inside it is startlingly peaceful — no sacred soundtrack or artful spotlights to pick out the altar, just utter silence and mellow afternoon light on the old wooden pews.</p> <p>I drink it in, then glance at the monuments on the walls, which turn out to be unusually absorbing. One is to Roque Ferdinand, “a Native of the Island of Bona Vista” who served a local family “with unremitted Zeal, Affection and Honesty Fifty two Years”. “What a kind family!” I think, only for a later online search to reveal that <a href=\"https://magistraetmater.wordpress.com/2019/10/28/black-slavery-and-rural-britain/\">Ferdinand was a slave</a> for 37 of those 52 years.</p> <p>Another plaque, for Edward Montagu, who fell at the siege of Seringapatam, India, in 1799, carries a charge of bitterness that is palpable two centuries later. “Tho' placed in this sequestered Vale,” the inscription runs, “[this memorial] may perhaps perpetuate TO POSTERITY THAT NAME AND THOSE SERVICES which the NEGLECT of his Country for which he bled, and of the East India Company, which he serv'd, for upwards of thirty Years, with Ability, Zeal and Honor, would otherwise have confined to OBLIVION”.</p> <p>On the last morning I decide to build an appetite for breakfast by continuing my walk, up to the top of the Downs — first along a deep lane, its late-summer hedges congested with traveller's joy, then past more waveform fields, and on into the woods, where, against the white noise of the breeze through the leaves, wood pigeons sound their endless throaty “who-who-who?” </p> <p>At the top I cross the <a href=\"https://southdownsway.org/\">South Downs Way</a> long-distance trail and push on to Glatting Beacon, with huge views east and north to the North Downs. There is a heady sense of past and present colliding here. Within minutes I pass a signpost pointing to Londinium and Noviomagus (Chichester), a reference to the Roman road that ran past here; a pair of tumuli, whose grassy mounds were centuries old when the Romans arrived; and two huge radio masts with humming machinery in an enclosure bristling with hazard signs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Breakfast, however, is calling, and half an hour later I am back at the Pig. In the whole 80-minute excursion, I met only one other person — three, if you count the dogs he was walking. That feels rather miraculous so close to London. The sequestered vale may get a little busier when the Pig is fully operational. But this little bubble of self-sufficiency will still be a refuge from the noise and bustle not many miles away.</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Neville Hawcock 2021 'The Pig in the South Downs: rural bliss, 50 miles from London' FT.com 13 September.
