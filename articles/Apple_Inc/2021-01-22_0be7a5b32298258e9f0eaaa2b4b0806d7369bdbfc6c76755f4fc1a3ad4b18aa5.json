  "text": "<p>   \"It's not our job to sell subscriptions or popcorn,\" said Chris Slager, an executive at the content-production arm of Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., which was involved in the deal for \"Cherry.\" \"It's our job to empower artists by finding the best distribution to bring their stories to audiences.\" </p><p>   Director Sofia Coppola also recently signed on with Apple to do her first-ever episodic series, according to a person familiar with the matter. To do the project -- an adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel \"The Custom of the Country\" -- Ms. Coppola garnered one of the most lucrative paydays of her career, that person said. </p><p>   Vine Alternative Investment CEO Jim Moore, who runs a fund that has invested more than $1 billion in film and television since 2007, says he won't miss the days where catering to actors and filmmakers sometimes came above investors' interests. \"At the end of the day, Hollywood is a business,\" he says. </p><p></p>",
