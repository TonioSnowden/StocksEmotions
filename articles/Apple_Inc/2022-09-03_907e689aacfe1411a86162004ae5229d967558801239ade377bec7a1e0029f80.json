  "text": "<p>What follows is a review of the S&amp;P 500 SPX to focus on one metric that is closely tied to outperformance, followed by more information about a select group of companies that might help you with your own subjective analysis.</p><p>ROIC and 10-year outperformance</p><p>A company's return on invested capital (ROIC) is defined by FactSet as earnings divided by the sum of the carrying value of a company's common stock, preferred stock, long-term debt and capitalized lease obligations. It is an annualized figure.</p><p>ROIC sheds light on a corporate management team's ability to make the most efficient use of the money invested to fund its business.</p><p>The carrying value of a company's stock may be much lower than its current market capitalization. The company may have issued most of its shares many years ago at a price much lower than today's. If a company has issued a relatively large amount of newer shares recently, or at high prices, its ROIC will be lower.</p><p>A company with a high ROIC is likely to have a relatively low amount of long-term debt on its balance sheet, or at least to have made efficient use of the borrowed money.</p><p>Some businesses are more capital intensive than others, which means ROIC comparisons might be most meaningful within specific industries. But that is not what we are doing in this screen of stocks.</p><p>For a top-down approach, there is no need to make fair comparisons. Looking back 10 years (actually the most recent 40 quarters of data available from FactSet), ROIC data is available for 453 members of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Here are the 20 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have achieved the highest average ROIC over the past 10 years: </p><p> Company                               Ticker   Industry                          Average ROIC — past 40 quarters   Total return — 10 years  VeriSign Inc.
