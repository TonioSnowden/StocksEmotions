  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Gear & Gadgets -- That's Debatable:  Can Remote Personal Trainers  Compete With In-Person Instruction?  ----  By Kenny Wassus",
  "text": "<p>\n  YES: For the past three years, Eric Perry has been working out with a personal trainer in his pocket. Using the iPhone app Future (available from $150/month), the 38-year-old has access to a remote coach who prerecords personalized daily workouts for him to complete. \"I don't want my life to revolve around going to the gym,\" the New Jersey graphic designer said. \"I'd rather the gym revolve around my life.\" </p><p>\n  Virtual training apps like Future have surged in popularity during the pandemic, according to Josh Bonhotal, vice president of performance for Future. And fans of individualized remote instruction say they don't plan to go back to in-person training even when it's safe to do so. Why pay up to $70 per hour, the argument goes, if they can get the same intensely personal dynamic for far less? </p><p>\n  With his subscription, Mr. Perry gets an individualized lineup of prerecorded videos for each workout, voice-over guidance, and someone to poke, prod and guilt him -- via video-messages and GIFs -- into completing them. His Apple Watch relays each of his workouts to his traine, who can tell by his biometrics whether or not Mr. Perry slacked off in the workout and follow up by pinging him. </p><p>\n  Some services offer perks that traditional instructors don't. Forge Fitness (from $100/month) can deliver personalized nutrition advice. Free databases like Trainerize, meanwhile, help users find an instructor who fits their needs and budget. \"The only difference is there's not someone physically next to you,\" said Mr. Perry. \"They're just on the other end of [a webcam] or text chat.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  NO: After a year of exercising in front of her phone and laptop, Olivia Song, a 44-year-old Brooklyn designer, can't wait to get back to the gym. Or more precisely, to the form-correcting guidance of personal trainer Gene Schafer, with whom she'd worked out at least once a week pre-pandemic at the ARC Athletics gym in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. Her home equipment also fell short, she said: \"You're working out with the two 20-pound dumbbells and bands you bought in 2004.\" </p><p>\n  While virtual trainers have a hard time ensuring clients use the right form, they particularly struggle to guide clients through breathing-focused disciplines like yoga or Pilates, according to Los Angeles yoga instructor Lauren McGrath. \"When you're teaching a class in person, you can literally hear the breath in the room, or you can hear that the breathing is kind of off,\" Ms. McGrath said. She can't hear clients' breathing patterns via Zoom even when they're off mute. </p><p>\n  Plus, unlike gyms that vet their in-house instructors, some free databases let anyone calling himself a trainer sign up. Your coach could be an internet drifter, whose only fitness credentials are the email and buff profile photo it took to create an account. </p><p>\n  Ms. Song is looking forward to reconnecting with her trainer, not only for the access to his exercise facility and equipment, but also for his trademark affability, a contrast to Zoom workouts, which she found cold. \"He's very Midwestern, super-nice, cheery,\" she said. \"He tells a lot of dad jokes.\" </p><p></p>",
