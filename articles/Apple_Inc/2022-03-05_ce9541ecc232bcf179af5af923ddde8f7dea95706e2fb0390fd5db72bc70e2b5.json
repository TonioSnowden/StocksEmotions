  "text": "<p>Suddenly, everything changed. By the time I returned from washing my hands, the table had been laid with the giant green frond of a banana tree and two little katoris, or bowls. A waiter came to heap the leaf up with hot white rice, topped with a drizzle of aromatic golden ghee. Another arrived with small pails of sauteed and stewed vegetables, some diced, others mashed, and ladled out a spoonful of each. A third poured gloopy yellow daal, specked with cumin seeds, and a thin red tomato broth into the bowls. A fourth supplied dabs of chutney, pickles, salt, sliced cucumbers and whole chilies, a slightly lighter shade of green than the bed on which they rested. Dinner was ready.</p><p>It was beautiful, dynamic, symphonic. I felt the cool glossiness of the banana leaf, then plunged my fingers into the hot rice, and began to eat. Kneading and mixing, shaping and soaking, drawing up intimations of heat and texture through my fingers into my brain, I chewed one mouthful even as I constructed the next. My immersion in my meal was complete. Life was wonderful.</p><p>\"Each group of people has special foods that create its members from day to day, that are their daily creators,\" wrote the 19th-century French historian Jules Michelet, nicely reversing the hierarchy between human beings and food. For his own people, in Michelet's view, these vitalizing staples were bread and soup; for the English across the channel, meat.</p><p>But in India -- a country divided between rice-eaters and bread-eaters, vegetarians and meat-eaters -- this experience of transference and transcendence, of being nourished and renewed as we eat, lies, I would argue, not so much in the particulars of our diet, which are varied, but in the experience of eating with our hands. We might use cutlery to serve and plates to eat on, but when it comes to the final journey of food from plate to palate, we believe that the proper vehicle of that consummation is our fingers.</p><p>In the ancient Indian science of ayurveda -- a system that sees food as a kind of medicine to prevent, rather than to cure, distempers -- our fingers cumulatively represent the elements of life: the thumb for fire, the forefinger for air, the middle finger for space, the ring finger for earth and the little finger for water. To eat with your hands is to initiate a system of correspondences, to receive the vital energies of life and to enhance taste with touch. In the Vedic texts collectively known as the Upanishads, there are many gnomic musings on food as the fundamental substance of the universe, passing from field to plate to stomach to soul, until the human being dies and himself turns into food. \"This whole world, verily, is just food and the eater of food,\" says the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.</p><p>Seen in this light, eating is a direct embrace of life, a sacrament, distinct from the knife-and-fork culture of the West or the chopsticks culture of the Far East. Eating with your fingers denotes not an absence of cutlery but the overwhelming presence and pleasure of fingers (which are endowed with the power of not only touch but memory) and a mindful approach to life's most important ritual.</p><p>Eating with your fingers is also a primal delight. The writer Madhur Jaffrey, often seen eating with her fingers in the video trailers for her master classes on Indian cooking, wrote to me of how the enjoyment of food was inseparable from the manner of eating it. \"Breaking off a piece from a chapati with the fingertips, taking it to the katori with the small goat marrow bone and its sauce, pulling the meat off the bone with the piece of chapati, dipping it again in the sauce and then carrying it to the mouth and chewing slowly, then picking up the marrow bone and sucking out the marrow, then reaching for a green chili to bite into, or picking up a bit of tomato or cucumber and carrying it to the mouth while still enjoying the marrow. . . . These are all deeply sensual pleasures that I would never give up.\"</p><p>In the rambunctious British food writer Jay Rayner's recent book \"The Ten (Food) Commandments,\" commandment no. 1 is \"Thou shalt eat with thy hands.\" \"I'm not sure I've met a food that couldn't be eaten with fingers,\" he declares, dramatically overstating his case, \"and improved by doing so.\"</p><p>Of course, even in foodscapes where the use of cutlery is the norm, we all eat with our fingers at some point or another -- an apple or a carrot, a sandwich or a burrito, a slice of pizza or a spare rib. But to the millions of people around the world in South Asia and Indonesia, Africa and the Middle East, who eat with their fingers as a first preference, finger-eating is highly technical and sophisticated, the result of a long socialization in childhood and a lifetime of daily practice.</p><p>It takes great skill, even artistry, to grasp a paratha or a naan -- Indian flatbreads -- and use your index finger as a clamp and your thumb and middle finger to pull off a small piece, then the top of all five fingers to fabricate a little scoop for dal or gravy or a wrap for meat or vegetables. Even more complex is the art of filleting fish while you eat, squeezing each morsel to tease out the little bones. Far from being vexing, this slows down the meal and deepens the enjoyment of eating a fine piece of fish.</p><p>Finger-eaters eat for tactile pleasures almost as much as the taste of food on the tongue. We caress the char on a piece of grilled chicken, burrow for the pearls of crunchy seeds inside the glutinous wetness of a stewed gourd, fondle the yielding blubber on a chunk of lamb, and assess a biryani by whether the grains fall freely from our hands, each as discrete as a raindrop. We do not waste food: We are utterly at ease eating meat on the bone, extracting tidbits from joints and hollows, and mopping up the last splodges of gravy on the plate.</p><p>And just in case we are thought to be at the bottom of the ladder of table manners, we have devised our own little schema of prejudice. In much of north India, it is considered good manners to touch food only with the top joints of the fingers. Those from the south, who often delve up to the second joint or even higher -- squeezing their curd rice into a ball with the palm of their hand, for instance -- are seen as totally declasse. Of this particular narcissism of small differences, one can't resist saying, go finger.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Choudhury is a writer and critic who lives in India and the U.K. His novel \"Days of My China Dragon\" (2019) describes the world of a Chinese restaurant in Mumbai.</p>",
