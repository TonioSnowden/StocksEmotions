  "text": "<p>* Many advanced safety features as standard</p><p>* Great engines</p><p>* Great engine warranty</p><p>Cons</p><p>* German rivals still enjoy handling superiority</p><p>* Pricey GT2 model</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* There are no significant changes for 2023</p><p>Price: We expect the 2023 Kia Stinger to start at around $37,000.</p><p>The 2023 Kia KR:000270 Stinger sedan dials up both the sporty and luxury aspects of a mainstream badge on the move. Here is a car with sharp style and driving dynamics that come close to German rivals like the Audi A5 Sportback and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. It even deploys rear-wheel drive in its standard form.</p><p>See: The 2023 Audi A5 offers athletic thrills with distinctive style</p><p>Based on the same platform as the excellent Genesis G70, the Stinger pushes the boundaries of what to expect from Kia. Naturally, that might also mean higher prices, but the company still packs a lot of standard equipment, plus a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, into a car that undercuts the German competition.</p><p>2023 Kia Stinger pricing</p><p>We expect pricing for the 2023 Stinger sport sedan to start at around $37,000 for the GT-Line and go up to about $52K for the GT2. Budget about $2,200 for all-wheel drive.</p><p>The closely related Genesis G70 starts closer to $38K and is a true sedan, without the Stinger's hatchback. The front-drive-only Nissan NSANY Maxima sedan is in that same area. If the funds are available to go for something German, the Audi A5 Sportback is more like $44K (with all-wheel drive as standard), and the rear-drive BMW XE:BMW 430i Gran Coupe is closer to $45.5K.</p><p>Before buying a new Stinger, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. The Stinger's performance is respectable in terms of resale value, and certainly not a deal breaker.</p><p>Driving the 2023 Kia Stinger</p><p>There's nothing particularly lacking in the 300-horsepower/4-cylinder engine under the GT-Line's hood. It has a pleasant punch at low revs, there are paddle shifters behind the steering wheel for extra driver involvement, and all-wheel drive is available to apply thrust to the tarmac in the most effective way possible.</p><p>It's something of a shame, though, to buy a new sport sedan and not have the sportiest version. Both the GT1 and GT2 have variable-ratio steering, a launch control mode in the transmission, Brembo brakes, and a forceful 368-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6.</p><p>Rear-drive examples also come with a limited-slip differential, while the optional all-wheel-drive system for the GT1 and GT2 includes torque vectoring. This ensures optimum stability and cornering efficiency by subtly adjusting the speeds of various wheels. Going through a curve, the outside rear wheel has more torque than the inside.</p><p>The GT2 takes things further by adding an adaptive suspension as standard.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>At first glance, it looks like a luxury car inside the 2023 Stinger, with the clean, crisp lines of the dashboard and a 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen set on top. Closer inspection, though, reveals materials that are not quite as classy as those in an Audi A5 Sportback or BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. But the Stinger doesn't cost as much, so buyers can make up their own minds on how they'd like to spend their cash.</p><p>To emphasize the Stinger's sportiness, a flat-bottomed steering wheel is wrapped in perforated leather, while aluminum pedals are ready to respond to the driver's right foot.</p><p>Occupant space is plentiful up front. Rear legroom qualifies for an \"OK\" designation on account of its 36.4 inches. And rear headroom is affected by the sloping roof.</p><p>Behind the 60/40 split/folding rear seats is a luggage area of 23.3 cubic feet. Compare that with trunk space of 10.5 cubic feet in the Genesis G70.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Despite the 2023 Stinger being described as a sport sedan, it's technically a hatchback — only with a sleeker roofline than a Volkswagen VWAGY Golf, for example. It's more like an Audi A5 Sportback.</p><p>Whatever it's called, it works. However, newer Kia designs (like the K5 sedan and Sportage SUV) suddenly make the Stinger look a bit passe. Time waits for no car, it seems.</p><p>The GT-Line has 18-inch alloy wheels, the GT1 and GT2 both have 19-inch alloy wheels. And behind those bigger rims are the red calipers of the Brembo BRBOF braking system.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Hatchback bodyOr fastback, sportback, liftback, whatever. It brings an extra element of practicality to a sporty 4-door car, enabling a maximum cargo area of 40 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.</p><p>Brembo brakesBrembo is an Italian company that specializes in stopping. Virtually every maker of exotic and fast cars has ordered from the Brembo catalog at one time or another. The examples in the GT1 and GT2 have vented discs throughout, plus 4-piston calipers up front and 2-piston calipers at the back.</p><p>See: 12 best American road trips</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The three different trim levels of the 2023 Stinger sport sedan all sound really similar, which is less than ideal. But the thing to remember is that the GT-Line is the most affordable new Stinger.</p><p>It comes with LED headlights/daytime running lights/taillights, heated side mirrors with puddle lights, rain-sensing wipers, keyless entry/ignition, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, 12-way power-adjustable driver's seat, self-dimming rearview mirror, and rear parking sensors.</p><p>The infotainment system includes Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, wireless charging, satellite radio, navigation, USB ports front and rear, Bluetooth, nine speakers, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen.</p><p>Among the safety systems are forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic collision avoidance, automatic high beams, lane-keeping assistance, lane-following assistance, and navigation-based adaptive cruise control.</p><p>Also see: 8 simple rules to maximize wealth—at any age</p><p>Factory options</p><p>The thing to remember about the GT1 and GT2 versions of the 2023 Stinger is that they have the V6 engine and therefore enjoy greater power.</p><p>Other differences include a powered sunroof (optional in the GT-Line) and LED interior lighting. Except for an 8-way power-adjustable front passenger seat (also optional in the GT-Line), the rest of the GT1's inventory is much like its less expensive stablemate.</p><p>The GT2 has an adaptive suspension, upgraded LED headlights, auto-dimming rearview mirrors, powered hatchback, power-adjustable steering column, head-up display, and a 360-degree camera system. There's also nicer (Nappa) leather seating surfaces, memory settings for the driver's side, heated rear outboard seats, 720-watt Harman Kardon surround-sound system, and greater adjustability for the front seats — which are also heated and ventilated.</p><p>All 2023 Stinger models are eligible for all-wheel drive and a heated steering wheel.</p><p>Don't miss: Four valuable lessons I learned taking a road trip in an electric car</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>A turbocharged 2.5-liter 4-cylinder unit endows the GT-Line version of the 2023 Stinger with 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. The GT1 and GT2 variants have 368 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque supplied by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6.</p><p>Be sure to read: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Both engines connect to an 8-speed automatic transmission.
