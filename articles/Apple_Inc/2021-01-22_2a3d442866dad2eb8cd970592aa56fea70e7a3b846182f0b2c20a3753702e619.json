  "title": "Robert Burns: No Holds Bard offers a frank assessment of the Scottish poet",
  "text": "<p>As a national poet, Nicola Sturgeon ruefully admits, Robert Burns has one asset: those on either side of the Scottish political divide can with justification point to something in his work and claim “He's one of us.” Every Scot can agree, at least, with that stirring call to arms against the English foe, “Scots Wha Hae”. In the week of Burns night, where haggis is scoffed, Scotch glugged and songs belted out, playwright Liz Lochhead presents a frank and loving assessment of the rascally figure for whom booze and fornication were as vital as versification. </p> <p>Born in Ayrshire in 1759, Burns didn't live out the century but left a legacy of 200 poems and 400 songs, which he had collated, adapted and improved from traditional sources. A struggling farmer by day and writer by night, he published <em>Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</em> in 1786. The legend was born when an early reviewer dubbed him the “heaven-taught ploughman”. </p> <p>No one without a Scottish connection is permitted to tread this sacred ground; Lochhead's interviewees include novelist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13d91bc1-87a8-452d-9067-1bc49b659075\">Andrew O'Hagan</a>, Scots Makar (poet laureate) Jackie Kay, and a brace of enthusiastic professors. The Reverend Richard Coles gets in because “My mother grew up in Scotland.” Coles travels to the kirk where Burns was forced to do penance in front of the entire congregation for his sinful ways. Burns got his revenge by immortalising one sanctimonious elder in the poem “Holy Willie's Prayer”. Coles muses on the ironies of posthumous fame by the gravestone of the real “Holy Willie”. </p> <p>Burns “was not a man who could keep his britches on,” observes Coles. He also enjoyed detailing his heartless sexual exploits in bragging letters to his friends. Lochhead invokes #MeToo, while Sturgeon believes his robustly radical assertion of equality, “A Man's a Man for a' That”, would have “person” in place of “man” if written today. Scottish artist Douglas Gordon investigated the dark side of Burns in his iconoclastic 2017 exhibition <em>Black Burns</em>, in which a representation of the poet lay smashed on the floor. </p> <p>Refreshingly, among all the adulation, Lochhead permits a dissenting voice, that of Jeremy Paxman (one-eighth Scottish). “Awful . . . hopeless . . . sentimental doggerel . . . trite, banal . ..” he moans while tucking into neeps and tatties. “His poetry is his weak point, I think.” O'Hagan's having none of it, proclaiming “Tam o'Shanter” as “the best poem about drunkenness in any language”. Eddi Reader, who released a whole album of Burns songs in 2003, imagines him saying “Get me off the shortbread tin!” No chance of that — or for that matter the T-shirt, commemorative mug, tea-towel or notebook. One interviewee estimates Burns's contribution to the Scottish economy at over £200m. A brand's a brand for a'that.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Sky Arts from January 26 at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
