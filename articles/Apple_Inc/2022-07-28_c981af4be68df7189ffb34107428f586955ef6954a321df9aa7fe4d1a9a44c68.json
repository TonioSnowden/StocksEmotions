  "text": "<p>* Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 were flat at 32,174</p><p>* Futures on the S&amp;P 500 ES00 were flat at 4,025.</p><p>* Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00 decreased 10 points, or 0.1%, to 12606.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 436 points, or 1.37%, to 32198, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 103 points, or 2.62%, to 4024, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 470 points, or 4.06%, to 12032. For the Nasdaq, it was the best one-day percentage gain since April 6, 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Thursday's reading on second-quarter GDP showed the U.S. economy shrank by 0.9%, following a 1.5% contraction during the first quarter.</p><p>However, stock futures retraced earlier losses as investors bet that the weaker-than-expected number might force the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive with its interest-rate hikes to combat inflation.</p><p>Still, the team at Capital Economics insisted that the number wasn't weak enough to pressure the Fed to reconsider its rate-hike plans.</p><p>\"The 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn't mean the economy is in recession. The decline was partly due to a huge drag from inventories, while most other coincident indicators, particularly employment, show continued expansion,\" wrote Andrew Hunter, the senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Wednesday's surge in stock prices was fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that interest rates are now in the range of neutral territory and that the pace of hikes may slow, though he left another 75 basis point hike in September as a possibility.</p><p>See: Was Fed's Powell dovish or not? 4 key takeaways from Wednesday's press conference</p><p>But Mohannad Aama, a portfolio manager at Beam Capital, said markets were mistaken in interpreting Powell's vague forward guidance as a signal that the central bank would slow the pace of rate hikes.</p><p>\"Yesterday was an overreaction and a misreading of what Jerome Powell was trying to communicate. The lack of forward guidance doesn't mean we're nearing a pivot it just means that there's more uncertainty ahead,\" Aama said.</p><p>In corporate earnings reports, Meta Platforms META, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, late Wednesday reported worse than forecast profit and sales and guided to revenue below estimates in the current quarter.</p><p>See: Facebook revenue declines for first time, and Meta's downfall is expected to get worse</p><p>Earnings are due from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Mastercard MA after Thursday's market close.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Ford Motor Company F shares were up 6% in premarket trading after the carmaker reported a more than 50% increase in total sales during the second quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. SWKslid 15% ahead of the open on Thursday after the tool maker's second-quarter earnings fell far short of estimates.</p><p>* Pfizer Inc. PFE shares gained 0.3% in premarket trading Thursday after the pharmaceutical giant reported big second-quarter profit and revenue beats driven primarily by sales of its COVID drugs.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery CL.1 CLU22 rose $1.74, or 1.8%, to $99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>* Gold GC00 GCQ22for October delivery gained $17.80, or 1%, to trade at $1,736.90 per ounce.</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.4% as the Japanese yen weakened following the latest Bank of Japan meeting.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSDand ethereum prices ETHUSDsurged Thursday, with bitcoin trading north of $23,000 and ethereum above $1,600.</p><p>U.S. stock futures pare losses after second-quarter GDP number</p>",
