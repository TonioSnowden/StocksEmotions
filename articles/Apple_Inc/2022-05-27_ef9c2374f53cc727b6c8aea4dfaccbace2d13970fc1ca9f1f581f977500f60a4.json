  "title": "China Smartphone Demand Weakens Amid Covid Resurgence; From Apple to chip makers, companies warn of fewer shipments and weaker consumer spending in the world's biggest smartphone market",
  "text": "<p>In late April, Apple warned that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China threatens to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion this quarter. This month, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. said its January-March smartphone revenue declined 11% from the same period a year earlier and partly blamed China's logistics crunches, closed stores and component shortages that stemmed from the country's rigid Covid-control policies.</p><p>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's biggest contract semiconductor maker and a producer of smartphone chips, said this month that it now expects global smartphone makers to produce at least 200 million fewer units of smartphones in 2022 compared with industry forecasts. Most of those cuts come from Chinese phone makers, said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-chief executive.</p><p>\"There is no end in sight to the downtrends,\" Mr. Zhao said in an earnings call.</p><p>The steep decline in smartphone demand is among the factors driving the deceleration in the world's second-biggest economy and inflicting pain on global electronics makers. China accounts for about a fifth of the world's smartphone shipments, according to TrendForce, a Taiwan-based research firm.</p><p>Across China, the impact of Covid-19 restrictions—including lockdowns at industrial hubs such as Shanghai—has rippled through the economy, disrupting supply chains and logistics as well as damping consumption. China's April retail sales, a proxy for consumption, were down 11% from a year earlier, the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest contraction since March 2020.</p><p>Last week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told some senior representatives for multinationals operating in the country that China is \"committed to striking a balance\" between reviving the economy and containing repeated Covid-19 outbreaks.</p><p>Consumers said they are tightening their purse strings, especially for pricier goods. Zhang Rui, a 43-year-old tech worker in Beijing, said she dropped her plan to buy a new smartphone this year. Ms. Zhang, who uses the iPhone 12 Pro Max and usually updates her device every other year, said she isn't attracted enough by the new models to pay a high price.</p><p>\"Cash flow is tight for people due to the pandemic. Are there any smartphone models available that are worth my money?\" she said.</p><p>Likely to be hit soonest and hardest are the lower-end devices, industry executives and analysts said, as consumers with a lower income level that tend to go for cheaper handsets would limit purchases in the face of economic uncertainties.</p><p>That trend is likely to hurt some companies including Xiaomi, Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp. and vivo Mobile Communication Co. the most, said Ming-Chi Kuo, a supply-chain analyst with TF International Securities based in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Apple's lineup tends to be on the higher end, though the sales of its less-expensive iPhone SE could get hit, he said.</p><p>Major Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi, Oppo and vivo together have cut about 270 million units of smartphone shipments this year compared with earlier industrial forecasts, estimates Mr. Kuo.</p><p>Apple, Xiaomi, Oppo and vivo didn't respond to requests for comments.</p><p>For smartphone makers and its suppliers, falling consumer demand in China added to a list of issues they have been grappling with, including chip shortages and fallout from Russia's war against Ukraine.</p><p>In January-March, the global smartphone market declined by 7% from a year earlier, according to TrendForce. The firm expects 1.33 billion smartphones to be produced globally in 2022, after having trimmed its forecast two times this year by a total of 50 million units.</p><p>Some of the biggest suppliers to Apple and other smartphone makers also have flashed warning signs. Foxconn Technology Group, the world's biggest iPhone assembler, forecast a revenue decline this quarter from a year earlier from consumer electronics, including smartphones. That segment accounts for more than half of the company's revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said in April that growth is weakening for chips used in consumer electronics including smartphones.</p><p>Despite the demand drop in China for handsets, the global chip shortage is unlikely to ease much in the short term, analysts said. The auto sector is still grappling with chip shortages, while it is hard for semiconductor makers to quickly shift production from one type of chip to another, industrial executives said.</p><p>SMIC's Mr. Zhao said supply of smartphone chips used to power the device, charge and access Wi-Fi networks are likely to continue facing constraints.</p><p>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</p><p>China Smartphone Demand Weakens Amid Covid Resurgence</p>",
