  "title": "Stocks Close Higher, Extending Post-Fed Gains; Quarterly results hitting after the close from Apple and Amazon",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1%, or 329 points , while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow had climbed in five of the previous seven sessions.</p><p>The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.9% annual rate last quarter, marking a second straight quarterly decline in gross domestic product, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p><p>While the data showed the economy is in a worse state than expected, investors would likely not rush to make any new bets on whether it will alter the Fed's plan for interest rates, said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.</p><p>\"There can often be this 'bad news is good news' idea,\" he said. \"But for the Fed, fighting inflation is still the priority.\"</p><p>Stock markets have started the third quarter in better form after the declines seen in the first half of the year. Corporate earnings haven't been as bad as investors had feared, suggesting that soaring inflation and signs of flagging economic growth aren't weighing too heavily on companies' balance sheets.</p><p>All three major indexes have risen at least 7% from their 2022 lows in mid-June. The real-estate and utilities sectors led the way in the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday, both rising more than 3%.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is serious about bringing inflation down. On Wednesday it raised its federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%.</p><p>Investors are looking to earnings figures from major blue-chip and technology companies for further guidance about the state of the economy. Tech giants Amazon and Apple are due to report results after markets close.</p><p>In other corporate news, shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms fell 5.2% after reporting its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue. Qualcomm dropped 4.5% after issuing a muted sales outlook. Ford jumped 6.1% after reporting a 50% rise in revenue. Online marketplace operator Etsy gained 9.9% after it posted better-than-expected results.</p><p>Spirit Airlines shares picked up 5.6% after JetBlue Airways agreed to buy the carrier. The deal came after The Wall Street Journal reported that the two sides were close to sealing an agreement following a monthslong bidding war between JetBlue and Frontier Group Holdings. JetBlue shares lost 0.4%.</p><p>Despite recent gains for major indexes, investors remain concerned about stretched valuations and the pace of Fed rate rises. Many aren't ready to jump back into the market.</p><p>\"The rally we have seen looks like a classic bear market rally, rather than the launch of a new bull market,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"We are still going to have a period where inflation is uncomfortably high and growth is uncomfortably low and that is not a good backdrop.\"</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.68% from 2.731% on Wednesday. The yield on the 2-year note dropped to 2.874% from 2.968%.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, declined 0.4%.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.5% to $107.14 a barrel. Gold prices gained 1.8%.</p><p>Overseas, European indexes were broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.1%.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.4%, while in China the Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.2%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong weakened 0.2%.</p><p>-Gunjan Banerji contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Higher, Extending Post-Fed Gains</p>",
