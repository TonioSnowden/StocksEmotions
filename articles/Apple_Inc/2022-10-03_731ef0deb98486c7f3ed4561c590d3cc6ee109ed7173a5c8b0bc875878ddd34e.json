  "title": "Ina Garten's No. 1 Secret to a Great Dinner Party; The cookbook author and TV host, whose latest book is out this month, starts every day thinking she won't be able to get everything done—then finishes it all by 1 p.m.",
  "text": "<p>Garten was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Stamford, Connecticut. She worked in government and at the White House before starting in the food world when she bought the Barefoot Contessa grocery store in Westhampton Beach, Long Island, in 1978. After selling it in 1996, she started writing cookbooks, as well as hosting her Barefoot Contessa cooking show on the Food Network, becoming known for a signature style that marries simplicity with her chatty tone and traditional, often French dishes.</p><p>This month, she releases her 13th cookbook, Go-To Dinners: A Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, which instructs readers on cooking and hosting a less formal, easier kind of dinner party. Here, she speaks to WSJ. from East Hampton, where she lives with her husband, Jeffrey Garten, about the breakfast she's had every day for 20 years and why she eschews food trends.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays, and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>Usually I wake up between 6:30 and 7 a.m., and if I wasn't up at midnight, the first thing I do is Wordle, which probably more people do than you care to think about. Then I check my emails, then I'm usually downstairs by 7:30, make myself breakfast and organize myself for the week.</p><p>What do you eat for breakfast to start the week off right?</p><p>I have the same thing for breakfast every morning. I've probably had it for the past 20 years. Every once in a while I get sick of it. But I have oatmeal and coffee. I make it in the microwave.</p><p>How do you stay organized?</p><p>I usually have everything on my phone now. I just go through what I actually have to do and when I have to do it. It's usually an entire day's worth of things to do, and I think, There's no way I can possibly get through all this today. And of course I do it by 1 o'clock. But I start the day thinking, This is impossible.</p><p>When are you most productive?</p><p>I meet my staff first thing in the morning at 9. We discuss what we need to do, what everybody's going to do…. At that point, you can put anything in my schedule, I can probably do it. Later in the week when I'm tired and cranky, I say no to everything. [After the meeting,] I work flat out until probably 1, and I'll meet Jeffrey for lunch and after that, I'm nonfunctioning. I can do technical things after that, but I certainly wouldn't be able to test a recipe.</p><p>What do you do for exercise?</p><p>I have a trainer come twice a week because otherwise I wouldn't do it. No way I would do it. I do yoga twice a week. Yoga I've done for probably 25 years, and the trainer probably five or 10.</p><p>What's your beauty routine?</p><p>Slap whatever's on the vanity on my face as quickly as possible.</p><p>Is there a No. 1 secret or trick to a great dinner party?</p><p>Yeah, a great cocktail. I think everyone comes in and there are watermelon cosmopolitans or some great cocktail, everybody gets in the mood. And great music. It's nice to have a really good dinner, but it's not the only thing.</p><p>Was the watermelon cosmo inspired by your viral giant cosmo during high pandemic?</p><p>I'm kind of known for cosmos because of that, but actually my friends [director] Rob Marshall and [producer] John DeLuca introduced me to their watermelon cosmos, which are in this book, and they're so good.</p><p>Are there any current food trends you can't get behind?</p><p>All of them? I don't think my cooking has really changed in the past 50 years. I just like simple food you want to eat at home. There was the foam trend, which drove me crazy. I like when I see a recipe that has the title, when you read it, you know what it tastes like. If you see a title, \"Chocolate cake with lemongrass,\" you're like, \"Huh, how does that taste?\" But if you see a title, \"Chocolate cake with hazelnuts,\" you know exactly what it's going to taste like. I tend to not follow food trends at all.</p><p>You mostly work from your barn—what's the most important thing about creating a good space to work?</p><p>It's so beautiful when I walk in. Every day I appreciate it. If I went somewhere on vacation and this is where I stayed, I would think, Why don't I have a place like this? There's a covered porch to sit outside. There are gardens with tomatoes and basil and fresh herbs.</p><p>What's a piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>Jump in the pond. A lot of people stand on the side of the pond trying to decide what the pond's going to be like, but you really don't know until you jump in the pond. I tend to jump a lot…. You'll figure it out when you're in the pond.</p><p>Are you one of those \"four hours a night is all I need\" people with sleep, or do you need a minimum to recharge?</p><p>I pretty much go to sleep between 11 p.m. and 12… One of the great luxuries of my life is that I rarely have to set an alarm.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>I take a multivitamin, and that's it. Michael Pollan says [to paraphrase], be the kind of person that takes vitamins but save your money. Who knows whether he's right?</p><p>What's your best time-management or efficiency hack?</p><p>My life is pretty simple. I have basically two businesses: writing cookbooks and filming a TV show. The first one is all the time and the other one is for three weeks twice a year. So I really prioritize the rest of my life as being my personal life. I say no to almost everything to make sure I don't end up not having a life. That's my personal hack for managing my time.</p><p>In the new book, you write about the pandemic and how it led you to relax your standards of what constitutes dinner, and there's an entire \"Breakfast for Dinner\" section in the new book. Do you think the future of the dinner party is fewer courses and less conventional overall?</p><p>The dinner party, that's quite a subject. I think people are more relaxed about dinner parties. I'm not sure they're giving so many dinner parties. I think we're more inclined to go out to dinner. We're exhausted. The pandemic's exhausting, politics is exhausting, climate change is exhausting, and not being with people is exhausting. I think more and more we're saying, \"I just want to be with friends. I don't have to spend the entire day making a dinner party so that I can do that.\" It is more casual, and I'm also finding that, if I'm giving a dinner party, I might make one thing and get a wonderful dessert from a bakery and order things that don't require me to cook, things that are easier to do. I just want to see people I love.</p><p>I love the shout-outs you give to friends and restaurants. Do you have any recent favorite places to eat?</p><p>These days, I'm choosing restaurants that have outdoor [seating]. The two that I go to the most out here are Jean-Georges at Topping Rose House in Bridgehampton and The 1770 House in East Hampton.</p><p>What are your routines like when you're working on a new cookbook?</p><p>I would say 95 percent of my time every day is testing recipes… I get up in the morning, I decide what I want to test that day, my assistants go and get the ingredients for me, and that's what I do for the day.</p><p>What makes you feel the most productive?</p><p>Great weather. When it's cool and the windows are open and the doors are open and you feel like you're kind of indoors and outdoors and the humidity is low, I think everybody feels better that day.</p><p>What's the most underrated thing about the Hamptons?</p><p>The Shelter Island [ferries]. I love to take the ferry because it feels like I'm going on a vacation.</p><p>What are you reading and watching?</p><p>I'm reading The Splendid and the Vile, which is Erik Larson's book about England during the [Second World] War. Watching, we're big on series. We just watched a series called Trapped. It takes place in Iceland. It was great. I can't pronounce the names.</p><p>You mostly work from your barn—what's the most important thing about creating a good space to work?</p><p>It's so beautiful when I walk in. Every day I appreciate it. If I went somewhere on vacation and this is where I stayed, I would think, Why don't I have a place like this?… There's a covered porch to sit outside. There are gardens with tomatoes and basil and fresh herbs.</p><p>5 Monday Must-Haves</p><p>A Cup of Coffee</p><p>\"That's definitely one.\"</p><p>iPhone</p><p>\"It's with me all the time. Everything I need to do is on my iPhone.\"</p><p>Grocery List</p><p>\"Shopping for good ingredients takes as much time as making the recipe.\"</p><p>Newspaper</p><p>\"I prefer to read the hard newspaper.\"</p><p>iPad</p><p>\"In the barn…I have my computer and iPad, where I can do FaceTime with my staff or an interview or something like that.\"</p><p>Ina Garten's No. 1 Secret to a Great Dinner Party</p>",
