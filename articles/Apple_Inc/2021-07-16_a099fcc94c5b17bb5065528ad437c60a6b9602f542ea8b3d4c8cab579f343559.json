  "title": "Business News: Netflix Takes Aim at Gaming --- Streaming giant hired a Facebook executive to helm new unit focused on making videogames",
  "text": "<p>The move speaks to Netflix's desire to attract new customers and keep users on its platform for longer periods, and it comes as the company is facing its first serious challenges to its streaming business. New entrants, including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and WarnerMedia's HBO Max, are making inroads, and deep-pocketed rivals such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are spending aggressively on content as well.</p><p>Netflix is still the dominant streaming service with more than 200 million subscribers world-wide, but its growth has slowed this year as pandemic-related shutdowns end. Investors have been watching closely to see if Netflix will diversify its revenue sources beyond subscriptions to support its increasing content budget.</p><p>Videogames could be a lucrative solution. Global consumer spending on game software is projected to reach $175.8 billion this year and exceed $200 billion by 2023, according to Newzoo BV. Mobile games -- the kind Netflix is expected to focus on -- are on track to make up roughly half of this year's haul.</p><p>Success is far from guaranteed, analysts say, as larger incumbents have at times struggled in mobile gaming and it can be a challenge finding the right content that lends itself to becoming a videogame.</p><p>Netflix's videogaming strategy is still a work in progress, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. The immediate focus will be on making mobile games, these people said, and they won't include advertising, as is the case with Netflix's entertainment operations.</p><p>Netflix is planning to make the videogames available to play in its app without an additional fee, one of the people said. The company didn't comment on whether users would also be able to download those games.</p><p>\"They'll probably lower their churn,\" said Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey. \"You can burn through a TV series in a day, but you can constantly engage with a game for months to years.\"</p><p>The company this week said it hired Facebook Inc. executive Mike Verdu as vice president of game development. Mr. Verdu joined Facebook in May 2019 and was responsible for bringing games and other content to the company's Oculus-branded virtual-reality headsets.</p><p>Bloomberg first reported the hire of Mr. Verdu, who has also worked at Electronic Arts Inc. and Zynga Inc.</p><p>At Netflix, Mr. Verdu will work alongside other executives with game-industry experience, such as board member Ann Mather, who spent more than 15 years as a director for \"Kim Kardashian: Hollywood\" maker Glu Mobile, a company recently acquired by Electronic Arts.</p><p>Jessica Neal, before being named Netflix's talent chief in 2017, worked as chief people officer at mobile gaming company Scopely Inc. And Netflix finance chief Spencer Neumann, who joined the company in 2019, was poached from Activision Blizzard Inc., one of the world's largest videogame companies. Activision Blizzard is suing Netflix over the matter. Netflix declined to comment on the lawsuit Thursday.</p><p>Netflix has increasingly signaled interest in the videogame industry. The company's recent deals with creative talent including \"Bridgerton\" producer Shonda Rhimes feature language regarding the creation of videogames based on content.</p><p>In April, Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said games are \"going to be an important part\" of the Netflix experience going forward. \"We're trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom,\" he said on an earnings conference call.</p><p>Netflix has had modest success in mobile gaming through a licensing deal with the Texas studio BonusXP Inc. Its $4.99 title, \"Stranger Things 3: The Game,\" is based on a popular Netflix property and has amassed about $315,000 in consumer spending in Apple's and Google's app stores since launching in August 2019, data from Sensor Tower Inc. show.</p><p>That game, however, isn't streamed online or housed within Netflix's mobile app. It is available for download only. For Netflix to stream multiple games from inside its mobile app on iPhones and iPads, it would need approval from App Store operator Apple, which has previously rejected efforts by Microsoft Corp. and Facebook to go down the same path.</p>",
