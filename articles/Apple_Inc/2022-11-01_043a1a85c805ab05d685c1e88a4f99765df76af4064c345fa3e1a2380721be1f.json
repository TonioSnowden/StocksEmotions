  "title": "Hong Kong Editors Go on Trial for Sedition Over Interviews With Activists; Two top editors of shuttered online outlet Stand News face a 20-day trial after being arrested by national security police last year",
  "text": "<p>If convicted, the editors could face up to two years in prison.</p><p>The charges were brought under the city's British colonial-era laws against sedition, rather than the National Security Law imposed by China in June 2020 to stifle pro-democracy voices that had fueled mass unrest in the city. Authorities have increasingly used sedition laws to prosecute opponents.</p><p>In a 53-page opening statement read out in court Tuesday, prosecutors alleged that Stand News' former editor in chief, Mr. Chung, and acting editor in chief, Mr. Lam, conspired together to publish 17 seditious articles between July 2020 and December last year. They included interviews with high-profile pro-democracy activists Nathan Law and former lawmaker Ted Hui, who are both living in exile, as well as opinion articles. The articles were published with the intention to incite hatred and contempt toward the city's authorities, prosecutors said.</p><p>Defense lawyer Audrey Eu argued Monday that the charges were unconstitutional and that the media has a duty as the fourth estate to report. If someone \"reported on a murderer does not mean he agreed with his actions,\" she said. \"If being a little critical is a crime, then the media would have nothing to do.\"</p><p>Stand News was a small online news outlet which relied on publishing articles contributed from bloggers and donations from readers during its early days. It came to prominence in 2019, when its constant video live streams and close coverage of the antigovernment protests became hugely popular in Hong Kong, drawing to it hundreds of thousands of viewers and readers.</p><p>The site shut down its operation hours after it became the second newsroom raided by national security police. That operation came six months after pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was raided and executives at the paper were arrested on national security charges that year. Its founder Jimmy Lai is currently in jail, awaiting trial for allegedly conspiring to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security. He denies the charge.</p><p>Prosecutors on Tuesday said Stand News deleted some of the articles from its website months before charges were issued, indicating the editors knew these ran the risk of violating the law.</p><p>Prosecutors said the activists had illegally lobbied foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, and the interviews promoted them as people \"who fought for Hong Kong's core values such as freedom and human rights out of their own conscience.\"</p><p>Stand News failed to separate itself from their \"illegal standpoints\" and promoted their ideas, prosecutors alleged.</p><p>The editors' trial is expected to last 20 days and may feature more than 30 witnesses.</p><p>More than 220 people have been arrested by national security police since June 2020, including dozens of opposition politicians, students and unionists.</p><p>Hong Kong Editors Go on Trial for Sedition Over Interviews With Activists</p>",
