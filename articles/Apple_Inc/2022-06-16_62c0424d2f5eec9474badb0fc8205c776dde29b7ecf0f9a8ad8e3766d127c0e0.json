  "text": "<p>Tom Cruise is inescapable. With <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4838608-4e7a-4aee-97a9-5eac95611886\"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> still at box office altitude, new blockbuster <em>Lightyear</em> contains a scene that eerily mirrors it: a square-jawed US pilot pushing himself to unfeasible speeds, G-force distorting his leading-man features. This time, though, calamity ensues. And unlike Cruise — as far as we know — the star has been created entirely by computer. </p> <p>The hero is Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans), the movie a prequel to Pixar's landmark <em>Toy Story</em>, released in 1995. The story proceeds from a clever little hook. In <em>Toy Story</em>, the tragedy of puffed-up space ranger Buzz was his unwitting status as mass-produced replica. Here we learn he was spun-off from a hit film. “This is that movie,” a title card reads.</p> <p>So then, an origin story for merch. The film (directed by Angus MacLane) is as slick as that suggests. It is also less cynical, an affable romp set in motion by that early disastrous flight. The result is a crash landing, Buzz and crew now stranded on a planet of tentacular aliens. The peril is perfectly pitched for an averagely fearless eight-year-old. Likewise the volume of cute, precision-engineered not to overwhelm the tolerance of parents.</p> <p>Of course, there is a life lesson too, the value of collective responsibility slipped into the story like broccoli nudged on to a school canteen lunch plate. But broccoli is good for you, and the latter-day Pixar is adept at handling big-deal issues —&#xa0;the realities of death, for instance —&#xa0;that kids' movies once nervously fudged.</p> <p>The premise does have a glitch. Had an animated movie that looked like this really come out in 1995, adult minds would have blown even more than they did watching <em>Toy Story</em>. Here the visuals are still dispassionately dazzling. Human faces have the squishy sameness that is now house style, but all around them is a grand, whimsical photorealism. You know at a glance that yes, that is <em>exactly</em> the texture of the artificial plush a robot cat will have as fur. It isn't the fault of the film that we're so much more blasé now than when Steve Jobs ran Pixar.</p> <p>Another hallmark of those glory days was the sunset melancholy that suffused the likes of the early Toy Stories. Here, something at least a little similar finds Buzz return from a test flight on his strange new planet to find himself barely aged, while years have passed on the ground for his comrades.</p> <p>Offscreen, the passing of time may be loudly mourned by ex-Pixar fans, dismayed that the outfit no longer turns out beautiful, aching films beloved by middle-aged critics marginally more than actual children. True, the modern studio has made some shameless cash-ins. But <em>Lightyear</em> isn't one. It is just the modest, nutritionally balanced work of a company now getting older itself, no longer revolutionary but still mostly well-intentioned. As your kids may remind you: it happens to us all.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas from June 17</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Lightyear film review — Toy Story spin-off has buzz but lacks the old Pixar ache' FT.com 16 June.
